         <title>The Effect of Hyperconjugation and Hydrogen Bonding on the Conformers of Methylated Monosaccharides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conformational landscapes of four 1&#8208;O&#8208;methylated monosaccharides&#8212;methyl a&#8208;glucose, methyl b&#8208;glucose, methyl a&#8208;galactose, and methyl b&#8208;galactose&#8212;were characterized using jet&#8208;cooled broadband rotational spectroscopy, supported by density functional theory calculations. A newly designed, simple pulsed nozzle assembly was used to introduced the sugar samples into a jet expansion without thermal degradation, eliminating the need for a complex and expensive laser ablation system. Ten conformers were experimentally identified by assigning their rotational spectra, and the intricate methyl internal rotation splittings were analysed. Notably, methylation alters the directionality of intramolecular hydrogen bonding of a&#8208;galactose highlighting its impact on structural preference. Natural bond orbital, intrinsic bond strength, and non&#8208;covalent interaction analyses were conducted to explore the interplay between hydrogen bonding and hyperconjugation. A set of &#963; to &#963;* neutral hyperconjugative interactions were found to override a strong hydrogen bond, driving a preference for the gauche conformers.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation and Stability of Benzylic&#160;Amide&#160;[2]&#8208; and [3]Rotaxanes: an Intercomponent Interactions Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the most recent focuses in supramolecular chemistry is developing molecules designed to exhibit programmable properties at the molecular level. Rotaxanes, which function as molecular machines with movements controlled by external stimuli, are prime candidates for this purpose. However, the controlled synthesis of rotaxanes, especially amide&#8208;benzylic rotaxanes with more than two components, remains an area ripe for exploration. In this study, we aim to elucidate the formation of amide&#8208;benzylic [3]rotaxanes using a thread that includes a conventional succinamide station and an innovative triazole&#8208;carbonyl station. Including the triazole&#8208;carbonyl station introduces new perspectives into the chemistry of rotaxanes, influencing their conformation and dynamics. The synthesis of two&#8208;station rotaxanes with varying stoppers demonstrated that the macrocycle consistently occupies the succinamide station, providing greater stability as evidenced by NMR and SC&#8208;XRD analyses. The presence of a triazole&#8208;carbonyl station facilitated the formation of a second macrocycle exclusively when a secondary amide was employed as the stopper group, presumably due to decreased steric hindrance. Moreover, the second macrocycle directly forms at the triazole&#8208;carbonyl station. This investigation reveals that slight modifications in the thread structure can dramatically impact the formation, stability, and interactions between components of rotaxanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Electrochemical Construction of Csp2&#8208;Csp2 Linkage at C5&#8208;C5&#8217; Position of 2&#8208;Oxindoles via an Intermolecular Anodic Dehydrogenative Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Applying electricity as a reagent in synthetic organic chemistry has attracted particular attention from synthetic chemists worldwide as an environmentally benign and cost&#8208;effective technique. Herein, we report the construction of the Csp2&#8208;Csp2 linkage at the C5&#8208;C5&#8242; position of 2&#8208;oxindole utilizing electricity as the traceless oxidant in an anodic dehydrogenative homo&#8208;coupling process. A variety of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles were subjected to dimerization, achieving yields of up to 70% through controlled potential electrolysis at an applied potential of 1.5 V versus Ag/Ag+ nonaqueous reference electrode. This electro&#8208;synthetic approach facilitates the specific assembly of C5&#8208;C5&#8242; (para&#8208;para coupled) dimer of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole without the necessity of any external oxidants or additives and DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations provided confirmation of this pronounced regioselectivity. Furthermore, validation through control experiments and voltammetric analyses substantiated the manifestation of radical&#8208;radical coupling (or biradical pathway) for the dimerization process.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation of Aryl Ketones Involving Free Phenolic Hydroxyl Group(s)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A straightforward asymmetric transfer hydrogenation for accessing enantiomerically enriched secondary benzyl alcohols involving free phenolic hydroxyl group(s) under mild conditions was developed. Various of optical pure aryl alcohols with a remarkable functional group compatibility were achieved with 78%&#8211;97% yields, 84%&#8211;&gt;99% ee&#8217;s and up to 10 000 TON. This rhodium&#8208;catalyzed reaction could be performed in a gram&#8208;scale without loss of the efficiency. Furthermore, the synthetic utility has also been demonstrated in the asymmetric synthesis of (S)&#8208;adrenaline and (S)&#8208;phenylephrine.</dc:description>

         <title>Cascade Reactions of Alkynyl Ketones and Amides to Generate Unsaturated Oxacycles and Aromatic Carbocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe novel amine&#8208;mediated transformation of alkynyl ketones and amides to generate 2&#8208;methylene&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrans, substituted 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;ones, and amine&#8208;incorporated arenes. These cascade processes are initiated by conjugate addition of secondary amine followed by hydrolysis of the enamine/vinylogous amide intermediates. The product distribution is highly sensitive to the steric and electronic effects of the substituents on both the alkyne moieties, the tether structure connecting them, and the nature of the amine. Alkynyl amide participates in the Alder&#8208;ene reaction favorably to generate more reactive allene amide that reacts with amine to generate amine&#8208;incorporated arene products. These metal&#8208;free cascade reactions are a useful synthetic method that can be exploited for the construction of various hetero&#8208; and carbocyclic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of (&#8208;)&#8208;Cannabidiol (CBD), (&#8208;)&#8208;&#916;9&#8208; and (&#8208;)&#8208;&#916;8&#8208;Tetrahydrocannabinols, Encapsulation of CBD with Nanoparticles for Controlled Delivery and Biological Evaluation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cannabidiol (CBD) is garnering increasing interest due to its significant biological activity. This natural compound is one of the major cannabinoids in Cannabis sativa L. In this work, we describe the encapsulation of CBD in solid and hollow pH&#8208;sensitive poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) (solid@p4VP and hollow@p4VP) nanoparticles, and temperature&#8208;sensitive poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (solid@pNIPAM and hollow@pNIPAM) nanoparticles for transport and release CBD in a controlled manner. The CBD loading into these smart polymeric systems was effective and their release profiles, solubility and resistance to stomach and intestinal conditions were evaluated, showing satisfactory properties and improved bioavailability with respect to free CBD. Finally, the A549 human lung cancer cell line was used as lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cellular model to carry out preliminary assays of the in vitro activity of the vehiculized CBD. For all these studies, synthetic CBD was employed, for which a new efficient and scalable synthesis of cannabinoids has been developed.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Divergent Synthesis of a 13&#8208;Ring Triquinone and its Facile Conversion to a [4.4.4]Tridecastarphene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acenes are notable for their optoelectronic properties. Starphenes are structurally related molecules possessing three acene arms that radiate linearly from a central benzene ring (i.e., linearly annellated triphenylenes). Large starphenes have been prepared using convergent syntheses involving transition metal catalyzed cyclotrimerizations of either preformed acenes or arynes. Here, we report a one&#8208;pot divergent synthesis of a 13&#8208;ring triquinone that readily converts to a [4.4.4]tridecastarphene derivative. The one&#8208;pot procedure involves the sequential reactions of three 1,4&#8208;anthraquinones with o&#173;&#8208;quinodimethane derivatives that are generated sequentially from a trisulfone precursor. The resulting [4.4.4]tridecastarphene derivative bearing p&#8208;(t&#8208;butyl)phenyl substituents was characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopies, as well as mass spectrometry, cyclic voltammetry,&#160;differential pulse voltammetry and DFT calculations. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal a relatively high&#8208;lying HOMO orbital (about &#8208;4.70 to &#8208;4.86 eV) and a relatively small HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap (2.1 eV), suggesting utility as a p&#8208;type organic semiconductor. Our [4.4.4]tridecastarphene photooxidizes in CH2Cl2 solution exposed to ambient light and air with a half&#8208;life of 150 minutes at room temperature, but shows no sign of degradation after 12 months in the solid&#8208;state. Our [4.4.4]tridecastarphene shows excellent solubility in various organic solvents including dichloromethane, chloroform and toluene, potentially enabling printed electronic applications.</dc:description>

Theoretical and experimental studies reveal a relatively high-lying HOMO orbital (about -4.70 to -4.86 eV) and a relatively small HOMO-LUMO gap (2.1 eV), suggesting utility as a p-type organic semiconductor.

         <title>Photo&#8208;induced three&#8208;component reaction for the construction of &#945;&#8208;tertiary amino acid derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of &#945;&#8208;tertiary amino acids (ATAAs), which are pivotal components in natural metabolism and pharmaceutical innovation, continues to attract significant research interest. Despite substantial advancements, the pursuit of a facile, versatile, and resource&#8208;efficient methodology remains an area of active development. In this work, we introduce a visible light&#8208;triggered three&#8208;component reaction involving readily available nitrosoarenes, N&#8208;acyl pyrazoles, and allyl or (bromomethyl)benzenes under mild conditions. This approach enables the straightforward assembly of a wide array of ATAA derivatives (41 examples) in commendably high yields (up to 89%). Mechanistic investigations elucidate that the reaction proceeds through a dehydration condensation between nitrosoarenes and N&#8208;acyl pyrazoles to generate ketimine intermediates. This is followed by a light&#8208;driven halogen atom transfer (XAT) process and a radical addition, culminating in the formation of the desired products. The approach showcases excellent functional group compatibility and late&#8208;stage derivatization potential, offering new insights and avenues for the synthesis of ATAA analogs.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Optical Property of [6]Cyclo&#8208;1,2&#8208;naphthylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A one&#8208;pot procedure with cobalt&#8208;mediated oxidation of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dilithio&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;binaphthyl by ferrocenium salts afforded the chiral cyclic hexamer of naphthylene, [6]cyclo&#8208;1,2&#8208;naphthylene (1). The molecular structure of 1 was determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR analyses, revealing its cyclic structure with an approximate D3 symmetry. Compound 1 exhibits blue emission at 383 nm with high photoluminescence quantum yield of 97%, which can be attributed to its rigid twelve&#8208;membered ring structure. Optical resolution of 1 by chiral HPLC allowed for the evaluation of its chiroptical properties. Each enantiomer exhibits circular dichroism with complex Cotton effects, which are grouped into three positive or three negative couplets. Circularly polarized luminescence is observed at 383 nm with an anisotropy factor |glum| on the order of 10&#8211;4. The high photoluminescence quantum yield and the CPL properties of 1 indicate its potential application as a CPL emitter.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Deoxycyclophellitols as Human Retaining &#946;&#8208;Glucosidase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclophellitol is a potent and selective mechanism&#8208;based retaining &#946;&#8208;glucosidase inhibitor that has served as a versatile starting point for the development of activity&#8208;based glycosidase probes (ABPs). We developed routes of synthesis of eight mono&#8208; and dideoxycyclophellitols and cyclophellitol aziridines, the latter as ABPs carrying either a biotin or fluorophore linked to the aziridine nitrogen. We reveal the potency of these 24 compounds as inhibitors of the three human retaining &#946;&#8208;glucosidases, GBA1, GBA2 and GBA3. We show that 3,6&#8208;dideoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;galacto&#8208;cyclophellitol aziridine selectively captures GBA3 over GBA1 and GBA2 in extracts of cells overexpressing both GBA2 and GBA3. We also identify a probe that selectively labels GBA1 and GBA2 over GBA3 at lower concentrations. In sum, the here&#8208;presented studies reveal new chemistries to prepare chiral, substituted cyclitol epoxides and aziridines, add to the growing suite of cyclophellitols varying in configuration and substitution pattern, and yielded a reagent that may find use to investigate the physiological role and therapeutic relevance of the most elusive of the three retaining &#946;&#8208;glucosidases: GBA3.</dc:description>

         <title>Migration of para&#8208;Nitrophenyl Groups in Methyl Pyranosides: Configuration and Conformation Determine the Kinetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>para&#8208;Nitrophenyl (PNP) ethers of glycosides are important building blocks en route to functional carbohydrates. They are stable in neutral media, however, under basic conditions such as during the Zempl&#233;n deacylation of sugars, aryl migration is frequently observed. We have employed a library of O&#8208;PNP&#8208;substituted methyl glycosides of the manno&#8208;, galacto&#8208;, gluco&#8208; and altro&#8208;series to study the kinetics of aryl migration in MeOH/sodium methoxide using NMR spectroscopy revealing that migration between cis&#8208;oriented OH groups is faster than between trans&#8208;oriented ones. The rate constants of migration decrease in the order of Alt &gt; Man &gt; Gal &gt; Glc and are related to the energy barriers of chair conformation inversion. The energy profile of the 3 to 4&#8208;PNP migration in methyl mannoside was calculated using DFT methods suggesting the Meisenheimer complex is an intermediate of PNP migration and that coordination of the sodium cation has a major impact on the energy profile.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Axially Chiral N, N&#8208;1,2&#8208;Pentatomic Heterobiaryl Diamines by an Organocatalytic Arylation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Probing Noncovalent Interaction Strengths of Host&#8208;Guest Complexes Using Negative Ion Photoelectron Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Noncovalent interactions (NCIs) are crucial for the formation and stability of host&#8208;guest complexes, which have wide&#8208;ranging implications across various fields, including biology, chemistry, materials science, pharmaceuticals, and environmental science. However, since NCIs are relatively weak and sensitive to bulk perturbation, direct and accurate measurement of their absolute strength has always been a significant challenge. This concept article aims to demonstrate the gas&#8208;phase electrospray ionization (ESI)&#8208;negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy (NIPES) as a direct and precise technique to measure the absolute interaction strength, probe nature of NCIs, and reveal the electronic structural information for host&#8208;guest complexes. Our recent studies in investigating various host&#8208;guest complexes that involve various types of NCIs such as anion&#8211;&#960;, (di)hydrogen bonding, charge&#8208;separated ionic interactions, are overviewed. Finally, a summary and outlook are provided for this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Assessing Solid Catalysts with Ionic Liquid Layers (SCILL) from Molecular Dynamics Simulations: On the Role of Local Charge Polarization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular simulation models unravel the local charge profile of substrate&#8208;supported nanoparticles in contact to ionic liquid molecules &#8211; thus providing structural and electronic insights to nanosystems used in (electro&#8722;)catalyses. While quantum approaches are limited to comparably small systems, we demonstrate the application of the QEq method for bridging time and length scales significantly. This enables molecular simulation studies for exploring the self&#8208;organization of ionic liquid and reactant molecules on supported nanoparticle models.







Abstract
Recent developments in molecular mechanics modelling of metal catalyst surfaces with interfaces to complex ad&#8208;layers or bulk liquids enable the study of 10&#8197;nm scale systems by molecular dynamics simulations of up to microseconds. Therein, electronic polarization as otherwise benchmarked by quantum calculations is mimicked via atom&#8208;centered partial charges that are adjusted dynamically to account for changes in local environment. Apart from thermal fluctuations, this encompasses molecule association and dissociation processes as well as externally applied voltage. Here, we elaborate the concept of employing the charge equilibration method to the molecular dynamics simulation of solid catalysts, namely metal surfaces and substrate&#8208;supported metal nanoparticles. This showcases the association of reactants and their interplay with local charge polarization upon co&#8208;adsorption of ionic liquids or application of external voltage &#8211; thus paving the way to understanding complex interfaces in (electro&#8722;)catalysis from molecular dynamics simulation.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Selective Fluorescence Sensing of Mg2+ and Al3+ Ions by Pincer&#8208;Type NNO Schiff Base Ligand: An Experimental and DFT Optimized Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A newly developed dual&#8208;functional fluorescence sensing probe (phenylhydrazinyl pyridine) Schiff base (SB) has been designed with good selectivity for distinguishing Mg2+ and Al3+ metal ions in different solvent solutions. SB exhibits quick and visual turn&#8208;on fluorescence enhancement in response to Mg2+ and Al3+ detection. The addition of Mg2+ in ACN&#8211;HEPES buffer (1:1, v/v, pH 7.2) at (&#955;max = 390 nm) and&#160;Al3+ in MeOH&#8211;HEPES buffer (1:1, v/v, pH 7.2) at &#160;(&#955;max = 360 nm) resulted in significant enhancement of fluorescence, up to 7 &#8208; 9 times. These low detection limits of 7.1 &#215; 10&#8208;6 M (7.1 &#956;M) and 5.15 &#215; 10&#8208;7 M (0.51 &#956;M) for Mg2+ and Al3+, respectively, have been achieved by this solvent&#8208;controlled platform. Due to the sensing potential towards Mg2+, the probe was utilized as an imaging material for breast cancer cells. 1H&#8208;NMR studies were utilized to explore SB's sensing mechanism through turn&#8208;on fluorescence. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were utilized to validate optimized SB and its intricate geometries, which govern the sensing mechanism in the solvent environment. Such a probe has extensive potential applications in bioimaging and the assessment of the quality of wastewater.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By synthesizing precision polymers using four methods &#8211; solid&#8208;phase synthesis, liquid&#8208;phase synthesis, DNA&#8208;template synthesis, and controlled polymerization &#8211; precision polymers with special properties in thermodynamics and crystalline performance have been achieved.

Abstract
In the realm of biological macromolecules, entities such as nucleic acids and proteins are distinguished by their homochirality, consistently defined chain lengths, and integral sequence&#8208;dependent functionalities. Historically, these refined attributes have eluded traditional synthetic polymers, which often exhibit wide variabilities in chain lengths, limited batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch reproducibility, and stochastic monomer arrangements. Bridging this divide represents a pivotal challenge within the domain of polymer science &#8211; a challenge that the burgeoning discipline of precision polymer chemistry is poised to address. Recent advancements have yielded precision polymers that boast prescribed monomer sequences and narrow molecular weight distributions, heralding a new era for developing model systems to decipher structure&#8208;property correlations within functional polymers, analogous to those within biological matrices. This review discusses the innovative liquid&#8208;phase and solid&#8208;phase synthesis techniques for creating precision polymers and the advanced characterization tools essential for dissecting their structure and properties. We highlight potential applications in self&#8208;assembly, catalysis, data storage, imaging, and therapy, and provide insights into the future challenges and directions of precision polymers.

         <title>Sulfonamide&#8208;Sulfonimide Copolymers as Novel, Fluorine&#8208;Lean Type of Proton Exchange Membranes for Fuel Cell Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the ongoing search for a cheap and fluorine&#8208;free alternative for perfluorinated sulfonic acid&#8208;polymers (PFSAs), we investigate a set of novel copolymers combining sulfonamide and sulfonimide functionalities. The materials show outstanding conductivities of up to 283&#8197;mS&#8201;c&#8722;1, high thermal stability over 250&#8201;&#176;C and easy manufacturing. On top they contain many possibilities for variation, giving them promising prospects as a new class of ionomers.







Abstract
In this work, a novel type of fluorine&#8208;lean proton exchange membranes is presented, using sulfonamide&#8208;sulfonimide functional groups for ion conduction. These groups are constructed on a polystyrene backbone for simple and cost&#8208;efficient usage as well as rapid scalability. The polymer is further tailored by adjusting the sulfonamide functionality with various end&#8208;groups, namely pentafluorophenyl, 4&#8208;fluorophenyl, butyl and octyl groups. These groups affect the pKa, leading to pKa values of 5.7 for the pentafluorophenyl substitution and pKa 10.5 for the alkyl chain. The glass transition temperature of the sulfonamide homopolymers can be reduced from Tg=151&#8201;&#176;C (Pentafluorophenyl) to 49&#8201;&#176;C (Octyl), making the ionomer more flexible at room temperature. The combination of the non&#8208;swelling sulfonamide further mitigates the high water uptake of the sulfonimide while maintaining the nominal ion exchange capacity. This combination leads to extremely high proton conductivities with up to &#963;=283&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature, which is clearly outperforming Nafion and approaches values for acid doped systems. This approach can pave the way to a novel type of ion conducting class in proton exchange membrane fuel cells.

     alt="Sulfonamide-Sulfonimide Copolymers as Novel, Fluorine-Lean Type of Proton Exchange Membranes for Fuel Cell Application"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the ongoing search for a cheap and fluorine-free alternative for perfluorinated sulfonic acid-polymers (PFSAs), we investigate a set of novel copolymers combining sulfonamide and sulfonimide functionalities. The materials show outstanding conductivities of up to 283&#8197;mS&#8201;c&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, high thermal stability over 250&#8201;&#176;C and easy manufacturing. On top they contain many possibilities for variation, giving them promising prospects as a new class of ionomers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, a novel type of fluorine-lean proton exchange membranes is presented, using sulfonamide-sulfonimide functional groups for ion conduction. These groups are constructed on a polystyrene backbone for simple and cost-efficient usage as well as rapid scalability. The polymer is further tailored by adjusting the sulfonamide functionality with various end-groups, namely pentafluorophenyl, 4-fluorophenyl, butyl and octyl groups. These groups affect the pKa, leading to pKa values of 5.7 for the pentafluorophenyl substitution and pKa 10.5 for the alkyl chain. The glass transition temperature of the sulfonamide homopolymers can be reduced from T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;=151&#8201;&#176;C (Pentafluorophenyl) to 49&#8201;&#176;C (Octyl), making the ionomer more flexible at room temperature. The combination of the non-swelling sulfonamide further mitigates the high water uptake of the sulfonimide while maintaining the nominal ion exchange capacity. This combination leads to extremely high proton conductivities with up to &#963;=283&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature, which is clearly outperforming Nafion and approaches values for acid doped systems.

         <title>In situ Reconstructured Alloy Nanosheets Heterojunction for Highly Selective Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;situ reconstruction process fabricates the Cu2O@Cu6Sn5 heterojunction while preserving the two&#8208;dimensional morphology. The synergistic effect of Cu and Sn active sites stabilizes the *OCHO intermediate, thereby facilitating efficient electrocatalytic formate production. The designed Cu2O@Cu6Sn5 heterojunction demonstrates outstanding CO2RR performance, showcasing its potential for practical applications in sustainable energy conversion and storage.







Abstract
Tin (Sn)&#8208;based materials are expected to realize efficient CO2 electroreduction into formate. Herein, we constructed a heterojunction by depositing Cu on Cu&#8208;doped SnS2 nanosheets. During the electrochemical reaction, this heterojunction evolves to a highly active phase of Cu2O@Cu6Sn5 while maintaining its two&#8208;dimensional morphology. Specifically, a partial current density of 35&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with an impressive faradaic efficiency of 93&#8201;% for formate production was achieved over the evolved heterojunction. In situ and ex situ experiments elucidated the formation mechanism of the Cu&#8322;O@Cu&#8326;Sn&#8325; heterojunction. Cu&#8326;Sn&#8325; nanosheets were formed via a stepwise desulfurization process, while Cu&#8322;O was generated through its reaction with hydroxyl radicals. This evolved heterojunction with a high electrochemically active surface area synergistically stabilized the *OCHO intermediate, thereby significantly enhancing the selectivity and activity. Our findings provide insight into the structural evolution process and guide the development of selective electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction.

         <title>An Effective Strategy on Synthesizing a Stable SiOx&#8208;Based Anode for High Density Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium fluoride (LiF) serves as a modified additive, which can enhance the electrochemical performance in SiOx anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Here, we demonstrate a simple way to prepare a series of SiOx materials with LiF modified. The addition of LiF can stabilize the solid electrolyte interphase layer, reduce the volume expansion, and enhance the Li+ diffusion coefficient.







Abstract
Silicon oxides (SiOx) have received extensive attention as a promising anode candidate for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, their commercial applications have been seriously hindered by low conductivity, large volume expansion, and unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) layer, which result in low initial coulombic efficiency, poor rate performance, and short cycling lifespan. In this work, we demonstrated a simple way to prepare a series of SiOx materials with lithium fluoride (LiF) modified. When the mass ratio of SiOx and LiF equaled 1&#8201;:&#8201;0.15, the long&#8208;term cycling capacity retention could be greatly improved from 30.1&#8201;% to 76.5&#8201;% after 300 cycles. The result was primarily because of the enhancement of electrons and Li+&#8208;ions transport and the stability of the SEI layer due to LiF addition. However, excess LiF addition could hinder the diffusion of Li+&#8208;ions. This study presented the great potential of LiF modified on SiOx anode materials for LIBs.

         <title>Bipyramidal Nanocrystals of Noble Metals: From Synthesis to Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review covers bipyramidal nanocrystals of noble metals, with a focus on the roles played by reduction, etching, and capping in their nucleation and growth. It also discusses how to control the exposed facets, size, aspect ratio, and corner truncation, as well as their effects on plasmonic properties and catalytic applications.







Abstract
Shape control has been a major theme of nanocrystal research in terms of synthesis, property tailoring, and optimization of performance in a variety of applications. Among the possible shapes, bipyramids are unique owing to their symmetry, planar defects, and exposed facets. In this article, we focus on the colloidal synthesis of noble&#8208;metal nanocrystals featuring a triangular bipyramidal shape, together with highlights of their properties and applications. We start with a brief discussion of the general classification and requirements for the nucleation and growth of bipyramidal nanocrystals, followed by specific aspects regarding the synthetic methods with a focus on the roles of reduction, etching, and capping, as well as controls of facet, size, aspect ratio, and corner truncation. In the end, we illustrate how these aspects affect the properties of bipyramidal nanocrystals for plasmonic and catalytic applications, together with future perspectives.

         <title>Benzodifuranone Crystals with Solid&#8208;State Emission Arising from the Introduction of Bulky Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We achieved benzodifuranone crystals with unprecedented solid&#8208;state emission achieved through the introduction of bulky aromatic groups. In addition to the unprecedented solid&#8208;state emission, the compound showed luminescent mechanochromism and thermosalient effect.







Abstract
Benzodifuranone derivatives, structural analogues of widely studied diketopyrrolopyrrole, have been reported to show photoluminescence exclusively in solution states. Here, upon introducing bulky aromatic groups into benzodifuranone dyes, crystals with unprecedented solid&#8208;state emission were obtained. A crystallographic analysis revealed that the emissive properties should most likely be attributed to the absence of stacking between the dye scaffolds. In addition to the solid&#8208;state emission, the compound showed responsivity to external stimuli, i.&#8201;e., luminescent mechanochromism and thermosalient effect.

         <title>50 Years of Organoselenium Chemistry, Biochemistry and Reactivity: Mechanistic Understanding, Successful and Controversial Stories</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In 1973, two major discoveries changed the face of selenium chemistry: the identification of the first mammal selenoenzyme, glutathione peroxidase 1, and the discovery of the synthetic utility of the so&#8208;called selenoxide elimination.&#160; While the chemical mechanism behind the catalytic activity of glutathione peroxidases appears to be mostly unveiled, little is known about the mechanisms of other selenoproteins and, for some of them, even the function lies in the dark. In chemistry, the capacity of organoselenides of catalyzing hydrogen peroxide activation for the practical manipulation of organic functional groups has been largely explored, and some mechanistic details have been clearly elucidated. As a paradox, despite the long&#8208;standing experience in the field, the nature of the active oxidant in various reactions still remains matter of debate. While many successes characterize these fields, the pharmacological use of organoselenides still lacks any true application, and while some organoselenides were found to be non&#8208;toxic and safe to use, to date no therapeutically approved use was granted. In this review, some fundamental and chronologically aligned topics spanning organoselenium biochemistry, chemistry and pharmacology are discussed, focusing on the current mechanistic picture describing their activity as either bioactive compounds or catalysts.</dc:description>

As a paradox, despite the long-standing experience in the field, the nature of the active oxidant in various reactions still remains matter of debate. While many successes characterize these fields, the pharmacological use of organoselenides still lacks any true application, and while some organoselenides were found to be non-toxic and safe to use, to date no therapeutically approved use was granted. In this review, some fundamental and chronologically aligned topics spanning organoselenium biochemistry, chemistry and pharmacology are discussed, focusing on the current mechanistic picture describing their activity as either bioactive compounds or catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Oxidation of Alcohols to Carbonyls under Decatungstate&#8208;Mediated Photoelectrochemical Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding carbonyl derivatives has been realized under photoelectrochemical conditions in the presence of tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (TBADT) as the homogeneous photocatalyst. The protocol can be applied to both primary and secondary, benzylic and aliphatic alcohols. The desired products are obtained selectively, skipping the need for purposely added chemical oxidants. An in&#8208;depth study of photoelectrochemical conditions revealed that the protocol works best under amperostatic conditions in an undivided electrochemical cell irradiated with a 390 nm LED lamp. The comparison with analogous electrochemical and chemical oxidant&#8208;promoted photocatalytic oxidations demonstrates the superior efficiency and selectivity of the hereby reported photoelectrochemical conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Uncovering the Potent Antiviral Activity of the Sesterterpenoids from the Sponge Ircinia felix against Human Adenoviruses: from the Natural Source to the Total Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Human Adenovirus (HAdV) infections in immunocompromised patients can result in disseminated diseases with high morbidity and mortality rates due to the absence of available treatments for these infections.&#160;Ircinia felix&#160;sponge was selected for the significant anti&#8208;HAdV activity displayed by its organic extracts. Its chemical analysis yielded three&#160;novel sesterterpene lactams, ircinialactams J&#8208;L, along with three known sesterterpene furans&#160;which structures&#160;were established by a deep spectrometric analysis. Ircinialactam J displayed significant antiviral activity against HAdV without significant cytotoxicity, showing an effectiveness 11 times greater than that of the standard treatment, cidofovir&#174;. Some structure&#8208;activity relationships were deduced. Mechanistic assays suggest that ircinialactam J&#160;targets an early step of the HAdV replicative cycle before HAdV genome reaches the nucleus of the host cell. The first total synthesis of ircinialactam J was also accomplished to prove the structure and to provide access to analogues. Key steps are a regio&#8208; and stereoselective construction of the trisubstituted Z&#8208;olefin at &#916;7&#160;by iron&#8208;catalyzed carbometallation of a homopropargylic alcohol, a stereoselective methylation to generate the stereogenic center at C18, and the formation of the (Z)&#8208;&#916;20&#160;by stereoselective aldol condensation to introduce the tetronic acid unit. Ircinialactam J is a promising antiviral drug against HAdV infections.</dc:description>

         <title>3,3&#8208;Difluorooxetane &#8211; A Versatile Functional Group for Bioisosteric Replacements in Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functional group (FG) is one of the cornerstone concepts in organic chemistry and related areas. The wide spread of bioisosterism ideas in medicinal chemistry and beyond caused a striking rise in demand for novel FGs with a defined impact on the developed compound properties. In this work, the evaluation of the 3,3&#8208;difluorooxetane unit (3,3&#8208;diFox) as a functional group for bioisosteric replacements is disclosed. A comprehensive experimental study (including multigram building block synthesis, quantification of steric and electronic properties, measurements of pKa, LogP, chemical stability, and biological evaluation of the 3,3&#8208;diFox&#8208;derived bioisostere of a drug candidate) revealed a prominent behavior of the 3,3&#8208;diFox fragment as a versatile substituent for early drug discovery programs.</dc:description>

         <title>The fabrication of ZIF&#8208;L derived ZnS/MoS2@NC anode materials for remarkable lithium&#8208;ion storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enhancement of electrochemical performance in lithium&#8208;ion batteries can be achieved through the incorporation of MoS2 with carbon materials and various metal sulfides. In this investigation, a MoS2/ZnS heterostructure was devised incorporating a two&#8208;dimensional nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheet (NC) backbone. The synthesis of ZnMo&#8208;ZIF&#8208;L precursors was achieved by introducing a Mo source in a 1:1 molar ratio during ZIF&#8208;L synthesis. Subsequent to high&#8208;temperature carbonization and vulcanization treatment, ZnS/MoS2@NC composite materials were successfully synthesized. Compared to the unvulcanized ZnO/MoO3@NC and MoS2 samples, the ZnS/MoS2@NC composite exhibits remarkable lithium storage performance. At a current density of 500 mA g&#8208;1, the initial discharge specific capacity is 2547 mAh g&#8208;1, with an initial charge specific capacity of 1674 mAh g&#8208;1, resulting in a first Coulombic efficiency of 65.76%. Furthermore, this composite material demonstrates optimal rate capabilities and a significant pseudocapacitance contribution. The nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon framework effectively mitigates volume effects, while the heterostructural design provides more active sites for lithium ions, thereby enhancing lithium storage performance.</dc:description>

         <title>100 &#956;s Luminescence Lifetime Boosts the Excited State Reactivity of a Ruthenium(II)&#8208;Anthracene Complex in Photon Upconversion and Photocatalytic Polymerizations with Red Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The triplet excited state lifetime of a photosensitizer is an essential parameter for diffusion&#8208;controlled energy&#8208; and electron&#8208;transfer, which occurs usually in a competitive manner to the intrinsic decay of a triplet excited state. Here we show the decisive role of luminescence lifetime in the triplet excited state reactivity toward energy&#8208; and electron transfer. Anchoring two phenyl anthracene chromophores to a ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complex (RuII ref) leads to a RuII triad with a luminescence lifetime above 100 &#956;s, which is more than 40 times longer than that of the prototypical complex. The obtained RuII triad sensitizes energy transfer to anthracene&#8208;based annihilators more efficiently than the RuII ref and enables red&#8208;to&#8208;blue photon upconversion with a pseudo anti&#8208;Stokes shift of 0.94 eV and a moderate upconversion efficiency near 1% in aerated solution. Particularly, the RuII triad allows rapid photoredox catalytic polymerizations of acrylate and acrylamide monomers under aerobic condition with red light, which are kinetically hindered for the RuII ref. Our work shows that excited state lifetime of a photosensitizer governs the dynamics of the excited state reactions, which seems an overlooked but important aspect for photochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>IPr*F &#8211; Highly Hindered, Fluorinated N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of fluorine atom has attracted considerable interest in molecular design owing to the high electronegativity and the resulting polarization of carbon&#8211;fluorine bonds. Simultaneously, sterically&#8208;hindered N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have received major interest due to high stabilization of the reactive metal centers, which has paved the way for the synthesis of stable and reactive organometallic compounds with broad applications in main group chemistry, inorganic synthesis and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysis. Herein, we report the first class of sterically&#8208;hindered, fluorinated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes. These ligands feature variable fluorine substitution at the N&#8208;aromatic wingtip, permitting to rationally vary steric and electronic characteristics of the carbene center imparted by the fluorine atom. An efficient, one&#8208;pot synthesis of fluorinated IPr*F ligands is presented, enabling broad access of academic and industrial researchers to the fluorinated ligands. The evaluation of steric, electron&#8208;donating and &#960;&#8208;accepting properties as well as coordination chemistry to Au(I), Rh(I) and Se is presented. Considering the unique properties of carbon&#8211;fluorine bonds, we anticipate that this novel class of fluorinated carbene ligands will find widespread application in stabilizing reactive metal centers.</dc:description>

Considering the unique properties of carbon&#8211;fluorine bonds, we anticipate that this novel class of fluorinated carbene ligands will find widespread application in stabilizing reactive metal centers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biosynthesis of Nonribosomal Peptides Chitinimides Reveal a Special Type of Thioesterase Domains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and their tailored enzymes have diverse biological functions. In this study, we investigated the biosynthesis and function of chitinimides, which belong to the non&#8208;ribosomal peptide (NRP) subfamily featuring a pyrrolidine&#8208;containing part (X part) connected to the polypeptide chain via an ester bond. A conserved gene cassette, chmHIJK, is responsible for oxyacylation of the pyrrolidine moiety in the X part. The thioesterase (TE) domain of ChmC (ChmC&#8208;TE) catalyzes transesterification reactions with a free X part or methanol as a nucleophilic reagent to form different chitinimides. The crucial amino acid residues in the ChmC&#8208;TE domains responsible for the specific recognition of the X part were identified, and they were conserved in all the biosynthetic pathways of this NRP subfamily to form a signature motif, YNHNR, suggesting a special type of TE domain in NRPSs. Chitinimides demonstrate the biological function of promoting the swarming ability of the native producer. This study provides deep insights into the biosynthesis of this special NRP subfamily, and shows that the special TE domain could be used to generate diverse NRPs by combinatorial biosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative N&#8722;N Bond Formation Versus the Curtius Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present herein some experimental results, including NMR and x&#8208;ray, which have led to the recent retraction of a Nature Communications article claiming to feature a metal&#8208;free cross&#8208;dehydrogenative N&#8722;N coupling of primary amides with amines under the action of a hypervalent iodine oxidant. These findings should help the chemical research community to avoid such pitfalls in the future.







Abstract
The oxidative formation of N&#8722;N bonds from primary amides has been recently reported and then retracted in the journal Nature Communications by Kathiravan, Nicholls, and co&#8208;authors, utilizing a hypervalent iodane reagent. Unfortunately, the authors failed to recognize the Curtius reaction taking place under the described reaction conditions. Thus, the claimed N&#8722;N coupling products were not formed. Instead, the Curtius rearrangement urea coupling products were obtained. We demonstrate this herein by means of NMR and x&#8208;ray analysis, as well as with the support of an alternative synthetic route.

         <title>Discovering of Atomically Precise Metal Nanoclusters by High&#8208;Throughput Syntheses Platform</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we propose a high&#8208;throughput metal nanocluster synthesis method assisted by machine learning, which can accelerate the discovery of nanoclusters, improve the synthesis efficiency, and successfully form a series of nanoclusters (i.&#8201;e., Au41Cu66, Au40Cu34, Au18Cu32, Au18, Au6Cu6, Cu&#8722;NC nanoclusters). This study further reinforces the importance of high&#8208;throughput screening in advancing the field of nanocluster research.







Abstract
Understanding the complete structure of noble metal nanoclusters is both academically and practically significant. However, progress has been hindered by the low synthetic efficiency of many nanocluster syntheses. In this study, we present the first high&#8208;throughput syntheses of homo&#8208;gold, homo&#8208;copper, and gold&#8208;copper alloy nanoclusters in dichloromethane at room temperature. Through high&#8208;throughput screening, we successfully obtained three nanoclusters in a single reaction: Au18(SC6H11)14, [Au41Cu66(SC6H11)44](SbF6)3, and an unidentified copper cluster (referred to as Au18, Au41Cu66, and Cu&#8722;NC). The optimized synthesis route was achieved with the assistance of machine learning for experimental data analysis, which also guided the synthesis of other metal nanoclusters such as Au40Cu34(4&#8208;S&#8208;PhF)40 (Au40Cu34), [Au6Cu6(SPh)12]n ([Au6Cu6]n), and Au18Cu32(3,5&#8208;C8H9S)36 (Au18Cu32)). This research demonstrates that high&#8208;throughput screening can be a valuable tool in accelerating the development of nanocluster syntheses.

         <title>Water&#8208;Stable, Eight&#8208;electron Acceptor Drives Anion&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Water Assisted Tunable Ionic Self&#8208;Assembly and Proton Conduction</title>

         <dc:description>
A highly electron&#8208;deficient, water&#8208;stable, eight&#8208;electron acceptor scaffold has been used as a platform to realize proton conduction through ionic self&#8208;assembly. In this unique self&#8208;assembled material, 1D water tapes are revealed, that undergo hydrogen&#8208;bonding with halide anions, thereby generating a pathway for anion&#8208;assisted, tunable proton conduction.







Abstract
Organic &#960;&#8208;scaffolds are being envisaged for new&#8208;age electron&#8208; and ion&#8208;responsive materials that can accumulate electrons as well as transport proton. However, such systems are extremely rare as electron&#8208;deficient scaffolds are unstable in aqueous solution. Here we detail the synthesis of a water&#8208;stable core&#8208;naphthalenediimide&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;viologen based tetra&#8208;cation, which accumulates up to eight&#8208;electrons within an exceptionally narrow potential window of +0.05&#8197;V and &#8722;1.12&#8197;V. The supramolecular interactions and the ensuing ionic framework are tunable based on the three anions, e.&#8201;g., Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722; and PF6&#8722;, that are investigated in this work. The ionic framework is formed and supported by a range of H&#8208;bonds, in which, the nitro benzyl groups act as pillars connecting the 1D water&#8208;tapes and the halide anions. The water molecules are hydrogen&#8208;bonded with the halide anions and bestow a facile pathway for the proton conduction, with proton conductivity up to 3.19&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. In contrast, the ionic assembly formed by the lipophilic PF6&#8722; anions do not host the water tapes and consequently the proton conductivity is found to be four orders of magnitude lower. This is a unique example, whereby proton conductivity is realized and is tunable within a highly electron&#8208;deficient, eight&#8208;electron acceptor, water&#8208;stable ionic supramolecular system.

         <title>A Donor&#8208;Acceptor Molecular Octopus and the CLICK Procedure in Columnar Liquid Crystal Phases</title>

Molecular Octopus: A donor&#8208;acceptor discotic star mesogen based on a porphyrin core, bithiophene arms and decorated with four fullerenes attached via spacer forms porphyrin J&#8208;type aggregates by porphyrin&#8208;fullerene supramolecular interactions. Mixed with a complementary star providing intrinsic free space between the conjugated scaffold, the fullerenes fall into the void and assemble in completely different columnar aggregates.







Abstract
Two star&#8208;shaped mesogens with a (meso&#8208;tetraphenylporphinato) zinc (II) core and bithiophene conjugated arms with 3,4,5&#8208;trisdodecyloxyphenyl periphery were synthesized. One of these molecules was decorated with four fullerenes via an aliphatic spacer. This is the sterically overcrowded compound with an octapodal morphology. The other star lacks the fullerenes and provides free space between the conjugated arms. This mesogen does not aggregate in solution, but in solid state it forms a hexagonal columnar and a highly ordered oblique helical columnar phase, while the octopus molecule assembles in an amorphous solid. Photophysical studies of the octapodal compound in solution and the solid thin film reveal the formation of J&#8208;type aggregates, in which the interaction between donors (porphyrin) and acceptors (fullerene) dominates leading to absorption bands in the NIR region of the spectra. The mixture of both compounds results in a self&#8208;assembly which is called the Click procedure. Fullerenes of the octopus nanosegregate in the pockets of the star mesogens generating hexagonal columnar structures with a regular stacking along the columnar axis. Thus providing free space is a tool to control the competition between supramolecular interactions and nanosegregation. Such liquid&#8208;crystalline donor&#8208;acceptor structures may play a role in future LC photovoltaic applications.

         <dc:description>
A photoinduced energy transfer enabled procedure for the construction of otherwise challenging&#8208;to&#8208;access polycyclic sultine derivatives has been discovered. The reaction demonstrates good functional group compatibility, mild reaction conditions, excellent diastereoselectivity, and scalable.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;initiated energy&#8208;transfer enabled radical cyclization for the divergent synthesis of polycyclic &#947;&#8208;sultine derivatives has been developed. The reaction provides an alternative and expeditious access to benzofused &#947;&#8208;sultine frameworks, the analogues of &#947;&#8208;lactones and &#947;&#8208;sultones, and features good functional group compatibility, mild reaction conditions and excellent diastereoselectivity. The robustness and application potential of this method have also been successfully displayed by two gram&#8208;scale reactions and the synthesis of polycyclic sultones. Mechanistic studies indicated the transformations through a possible energy&#8208;transfer enabled intramolecular radical homolytic substitution or hydrogen atom transfer process mainly.

         <title>Self&#8208;Replication Without Hydrogen&#8208;Bonds: An Exobiotic Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exobiotic self&#8208;replication: When sulfur is positioned between the two nitrogens of benzothiadiazole, it can engage in edge&#8208;on molecular recognition events. We present a new potential self&#8208;replicating system based on this interaction, and evidence for autocatalysis. The designs have implications for exobiology, due to their cosmic similarities and potential for genetic capacity.







Abstract
Life on Earth uses DNA as the central template for self&#8208;replication, genetic encoding, and information transfer. However, there are no physical laws precluding life's existence elsewhere in space, and alternative life forms may not need DNA. In the search for exobiology, knowing what to look for as a biosignature remains a challenge &#8211; especially if it is not from the obvious list of biologic building blocks. Clues from chemicals recently discovered on Mars and in the Taurus Molecular Cloud 1 (TMC&#8208;1), show that intriguing organic compounds exist beyond Earth, which could provide a starting point for unconventional exobiotic designs. Here we present a new potential self&#8208;replicating system with structural similarities to recently discovered compounds on Mars and TMC&#8208;1. Rather than using DNA's hydrogen&#8208;bonding motif for reliable base&#8208;paring, our design employs sulfur&#8208;nitrogen interactions to selectively template unique benzothiadiazole units in sequence. We synthesized and studied two versions of this system, one reversible and the other irreversible, and found experimental evidence of self&#8208;replication in d&#8208;chloroform solvent. These results are part of a larger pursuit in our lab for developing a basis for a potential exobiological system using starting blocks closely related to these cosmic compounds.

         <title>DNA Hierarchical Superstructures from Micellar Units: Stiff Hydrogels and Anisotropic Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using three different orthogonal interactions &#8211; hydrophobic effect, RNA kissing loops, DNA base pairing &#8211; we created hierarchical nanostructures from precise DNA amphiphiles. These micron&#8208;sized materials are controlled by the nanoscale structure of the self&#8208;assembled amphiphiles with sequence&#8208;dependent behavior and have found applications as self&#8208;healing hydrogels. This bottom&#8208;up approach opens new avenues towards novel DNA hybrid materials.







Abstract
Supramolecular materials have been assembled using a wide range of interactions, including the hydrophobic effect, DNA base&#8208;pairing, and hydrogen bonding. Specifically, DNA amphiphiles with a hydrophobic building block self&#8208;assemble into diverse morphologies depending on the length and composition of both blocks. Herein, we take advantage of the orthogonality of different supramolecular interactions &#8211; the hydrophobic effect, Watson&#8208;Crick&#8208;Franklin base pairing and RNA kissing loops &#8211; to create hierarchical self&#8208;assemblies with controlled morphologies on both the nanometer and the micrometer scales. Assembly through base&#8208;pairing leads to the formation of hybrid, multi&#8208;phasic hydrogels with high stiffness and self&#8208;healing properties. Assembly via hydrophobic core interactions gives anisotropic, discrete assemblies, where DNA fibers with one sequence are terminated with DNA spheres bearing different sequences. This work opens new avenues for the bottom&#8208;up construction of DNA&#8208;based materials, with promising applications in drug delivery, tissue engineering, and the creation of complex DNA structures from a minimum array of components.

         <title>Luminescent Platinum(II) Complexes with Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Flexible Lewis Pair Ligands: Spectroscopic and Computational Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of platinum(II) complexes containing stimuli&#8208;responsive Flexible Lewis Pair (FlexLP) ligands were synthesized and characterized. The photophysical properties of the complexes have been studied using spectroscopic techniques and theoretical calculations. The results show that these complexes exhibit readily tunable fluorescence and triplet excited&#8208;state lifetime that can be controlled by the solvent and peripheral ligands on the platinum(II) centers.







Abstract
A series of new luminescent bimetallic platinum(II) complexes with stimuli&#8208;responsive flexible Lewis pair (FlexLP) ligands are described. The FlexLP ligands consist of a dimesitylboron Lewis acid and diphenylphosphine oxide Lewis base which are in equilibrium between the unbound open form and the Lewis adduct, controlled by the hydrogen bond donating strength of the solvent. Spectroscopic techniques and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to interpret the photophysics of the platinum(II) complexes. All complexes exhibit tunable absorption in the region of 300&#8211;500&#8197;nm and green to orange photoluminescence, depending on the ratio of weak (THF) to strong (MeOH) hydrogen bond donating solvent employed. Spectroscopic and computational data shows that phosphine and peripheral acetylide ligands on the platinum(II) centers have limited influence on the emission energy, indicating the emission originates from the FlexLP&#8208;dominated fluorescence. Using time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy it is shown that the complexes undergo intersystem crossing (ISC) to the triplet excited state upon photoexcitation, and the ISC efficiency is affected by the peripheral acetylide ligands. The triplet excited state lifetime can also be manipulated by the state of the FlexLP ligand, with the closed form complexes having longer lifetimes than the open form complexes.

         <title>Investigating the Mechanism of Triboluminescence: Insights from Structural and Electrostatic Characterization of Copper Thiocyanate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The creation of oppositely charged pairs, followed by their recombination to exhibit triboluminescence upon disrupting intermolecular interactions during mechanical fracture of crystal, was characterized by X&#8208;ray analysis and theoretical calculations. This study elucidated the crucial role of charge separation in triboluminescence and enabled its activation and deactivation through molecular network design.







Abstract
Triboluminescence is a phenomenon in which light is generated through mechanical stress; it has emerging applications in stress&#8208;sensing devices. Although the prevailing mechanistic model indicates that light emits from charge separation and recombination in fracture planes arising from polar structures, its application in designing triboluminescent materials remains limited owing to numerous exceptions. This study provides insights into the essential requirements for triboluminescence by investigating the structural and electrostatic properties of fractured crystals of copper thiocyanate complexes. The examined fracture plane indicated that charge pairs (which are essential for light emission) form when intermolecular interactions are disrupted during fracturing. On the basis of the nature of these charges, we successfully suppressed triboluminescence by inhibiting the formation of intermolecular interactions disrupted in the examined complexes. Furthermore, we induced its re&#8208;emergence by creating an alternative fracture plane through controlled manipulation of the molecular network. This demonstrative deactivation and reactivation of triboluminescence underscores the critical role of intermolecular disruption in generating charge pairs, a prerequisite for triboluminescence.

         <title>Tuning the Thermal Stability of Tetra&#8208;o&#8211;chloroazobenzene Derivatives by Transforming Push&#8208;Pull to Push&#8208;Push Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
From push&#8208;pull to push&#8208;push tetra&#8208;o&#8208;chloroazobenzenes: Six new tetra&#8208;o&#8208;chloroazobenzenes bearing push&#8208;pull systems displaying very short half&#8208;life for the Z&#8208;isomers (t1/2&lt;10&#8197;ms) have been successfully synthesized via the azo&#8208;coupling method. Through one&#8208;step reduction of the nitro group, the push&#8208;pull tetra&#8208;o&#8208;chloroazobenzenes can be readily transformed into the push&#8208;push derivatives, with dramatically increased thermostability for the corresponding Z&#8208;isomers (t1/2&gt;4&#8197;h). Furthermore, these functionalisable azobenzenes demonstrate excellent photostability under full&#8208;visible light irradiation.







Abstract
Molecular photoswitches provide interesting tools to reversibly control various biological functions with light. Thanks to its small size and easy introduction into the biomolecules, azobenzene derivatives have been widely employed in the field of photopharmacology. All visible&#8208;light switchable azobenzenes with controllable thermostability are highly demanded. Based on the reported tetra&#8208;o&#8208;chloroazobenzenes, we synthesized push&#8208;pull systems, by introducing dialkyl amine and nitro groups as strong electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the para&#8208;positions, and then transformed to push&#8208;push systems by a simple reduction step. The developed push&#8208;pull and push&#8208;push tetra&#8208;o&#8208;chloroazobenzene derivatives displayed excellent photoswitching properties, as previously reported. The half&#8208;life of the Z&#8208;isomers can be tuned from milliseconds for the push&#8208;pull system to several hours for the push&#8208;push system. The n&#8208;&#960;* and &#960;&#8208;&#960;* transitions have better resolution in the push&#8208;push molecules, and excitation at different wavelengths can tune the E/Z ratio at the photostationary state. For one push&#8208;pull molecule, structure and absorption spectra obtained from theoretical calculations are compared with experimental data, along with data on the push&#8208;push counterpart.

         <title>Quantitative Characterization of RCA&#8208;Based DNA Hydrogels &#8211; Towards Rational Materials Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of template sequences and reaction conditions on the synthesis of DNA hydrogels via Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA) was systematically investigated. The employed methodology is high&#8208;throughput capable and facilitates the development of sequence&#8208;property relationships by correlating reaction process parameters with synthesis efficiency and mechanical material properties.







Abstract
DNA hydrogels hold significant promise for biomedical applications and can be synthesized through enzymatic Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA). Due to the exploratory nature of this emerging field, standardized RCA protocols specifying the impact of reaction parameters are currently lacking. This study varied template sequences and reagent concentrations, evaluating RCA synthesis efficiency and hydrogel mechanical properties through quantitative PCR (qPCR) and indentation measurements, respectively. Primer concentration and stabilizing additives showed minimal impact on RCA efficiency, while changes in polymerase and nucleotide concentrations had a stronger effect. Concentration of the circular template exerted the greatest influence on RCA productivity. An exponential correlation between hydrogel viscosity and DNA amplicon concentration was observed, with nucleobase sequence significantly affecting both amplification efficiency and material properties, particularly through secondary structures. This study suggests that combining high&#8208;throughput experimental methods with structural folding prediction offers a viable approach for systematically establishing structure&#8208;property relationships, aiding the rational design of DNA hydrogel material systems.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Azines Bearing a Guanidine Core from N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC)&#8208;Derived Selenoureas and Diazo Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study introduces a novel transformation between N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;derived selenoureas and diazo compounds in the presence of triphenylphosphine. Products incorporating both an azine and a guanidine moiety are obtained, with potential applications in pharmaceuticals, materials chemistry, and organic synthesis.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;derived selenoureas comprise a fundamentally important class of NHC derivatives, with key applications in coordination chemistry and the determination of NHC electronic properties. Considering the broad reactivity of chalcogen&#8208;containing compounds, it is surprising to note that the use of NHC&#8208;derived selenoureas as organic synthons remains essentially unexplored. The present contribution introduces a novel, straightforward transformation leading to azines bearing a guanidine moiety, through the reaction of a wide range of NHC&#8208;derived selenoureas with commercially available diazo compounds, in the presence of triphenylphosphine. This transformation offers a new approach to such products, having biological, materials chemistry, and organic synthesis applications. The guanidine&#8208;bearing azines are obtained in excellent yields, with all manipulations taking place in air. A reaction mechanism is proposed, based on both experimental mechanistic findings and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. A one&#8208;pot, multicomponent transesterification reaction between selenoureas, &#945;&#8208;diazoesters, alcohols, and triphenylphosphine was also developed, providing highly functionalized azines.

This paper describes the design and synthesis of a pillar[5] arene&#8208;based polymer (Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP) for enhancing the adsorption and recovery of rare earth elements (REE). Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP exhibits excellent adsorption capacity, thermal stability, and porous structure. It shows versatility in absorbing and recovering various RREs, with the potential for reuse in green agriculture.







Abstract
While rare earth elements (REEs) are essential for modern technology, their production methods raise concerns for agriculture. Researchers are now exploring ways to control and recycle REEs pollution, aiming to minimize agricultural impacts and potentially even develop methods to utilize these elements for improved crop yields. Regarding this issue, a new type of pillar[5]arene polymer (Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP) has been designed and synthesized by click reaction to enhance the efficiency of adsorption and recovery of rare earth metals. This polymer incorporates the unique structure of 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;pyridine. The results of various analyses revealed that Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP exhibits excellent thermal stability, a high specific surface area, and well&#8208;distributed networks of micropores and mesoporous structures. The adsorption capacity of Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP for Tm3+, a representative REE, was evaluated using the Langmuir and Freundlich isothermal adsorption models with a maximum adsorption capacity (Qmax) of 127.71&#8197;mg/g. Furthermore, the versatility of Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP in adsorption and recovering various REEs was tested. In addition to its adsorption capabilities, the potential of Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP for rare earth recovery and reuse was assessed through experiments on the impact of Tm3+ and La3+ on seed germination. These experiments demonstrated the wide&#8208;ranging applicability of Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP in recovering and reusing REEs for green agriculture.

         <title>A BODIPY&#8208;Ferrocene Conjugate for the Combined Photodynamic Therapy and Chemodynamic Therapy with Improved Antitumor Efficiency</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>

A BODIPY&#8208;ferrocene conjugate with balanced 1O2 and &#8901;OH generation ability has been designed and synthesized. The as&#8208;prepared conjugate can significantly improve the intracellular ROS level of tumor cells by combining PDT and CDT at low drug doses, thus realizing the efficient tumor cells killing with a synergistic strategy.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) can destroy tumor cells by generating singlet oxygen (1O2) under light irradiation, which is limited by the hypoxia of the neoplastic tissue. Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) can produce toxic hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH) to eradicate tumor cells by catalytic decomposition of endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), the therapeutic effect of which is highly dependent on the concentration of H2O2. Herein, we propose a BODIPY&#8208;ferrocene conjugate with a balanced 1O2 and &#8901;OH generation capacity, which can serve as a high&#8208;efficiency antitumor agent by combining PDT and CDT. The ferrocene moieties endow the as&#8208;prepared conjugates with the ability of chemodynamic killing of tumor cells. Moreover, combined PDT/CDT therapy with improved antitumor efficiency can be realized after exposure to light irradiation. Compared with the monotherapy by PDT or CDT, the BODIPY&#8208;ferrocene conjugates can significantly increase the intracellular ROS levels of the tumor cells after light irradiation, thereby inducing the tumor cell apoptosis at low drug doses. In this way, a synergistic antitumor treatment is achieved by the combination of PDT and CDT.

         <title>Solvent Effect on Dative and Ionic Bond Strengths: A Unified Theory from Potential Analysis and Valence&#8208;Bond Computations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potential energy surface (PES) analysis is conducted to interpret the solvent&#8208;induced variations in the strengths of dative (Me3NBH3) and ionic (LiCl) bonds, which possess both ionic and covalent (neutral) characteristics, along the bond distances. The different responses of Me3NBH3 (blue&#8208;shifting) and LiCl (red&#8208;shifting) to solvation are subsequently examined with valence bond (VB) theory.







Abstract
Solvent molecules interact with a solute through various intermolecular forces. Here we employed a potential energy surface (PES) analysis to interpret the solvent&#8208;induced variations in the strengths of dative (Me3NBH3) and ionic (LiCl) bonds, which possess both ionic and covalent (neutral) characteristics. The change of a bond is driven by the gradient (force) of the solvent&#8208;solute interaction energy with respect to the focused bond length. Positive force shortens the bond length and increases the bond force constant, leading to a blue&#8208;shift of the bond stretching vibrational frequency upon solvation. Conversely, negative force elongates the bond, resulting in a reduced bond force constant and red&#8208;shift of the stretching vibrational frequency. The different responses of Me3NBH3 and LiCl to solvation are studied with valence bond (VB) theory, as Me3NBH3 and LiCl are dominated by the neutral covalent VB structure and the ionic VB structure, respectively. The dipole moment of an ionic VB structure increases along the increasing bond distance, while the dipole moment of a neutral covalent VB structure increases with the decreasing bond distance. The roles of the dominating VB structures are further examined by the geometry optimizations and frequency calculations with the block&#8208;localized wavefunction (BLW) method.

         <title>Unveiling the Twisted Aromatic Donor Effect on the Nonlinear Response of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A Type Malononitrile&#8208;Derived Chromophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular structure modification by incorporating twisted aromatic donors into malononitrile&#8208;derived D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A chromophores results in diminished charge separation and intramolecular charge transfer, as demonstrated by the reduced nonlinear response compared to their planar counterparts.







Abstract
This study presents the design, synthesis, and comprehensive characterization of a novel series of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type malononitrile&#8208;derived chromophores, BTC&#8208;1&#8211;BTC&#8208;4. Combining various spectroscopic techniques, nonlinear Z&#8208;scan measurements, and quantum chemical calculations, we revealed the intricate relationship between nonlinear optical properties and the interplay of molecular structure, intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), and dipole moments (&#956;). Our experimental and computational findings corroborate that the polarization degree in the ground state, the charge separation in the excited state and twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) collectively dictate the nonlinear optical properties of the compounds. Notably, BTC&#8208;1 exhibits an exceptional nonlinear absorption coefficient &#946; value (2&#215;10&#8722;8&#8197;m&#8201;W&#8722;1), attributed to its optimized charge transfer efficiency and pronounced degree of charge separation. Our findings provide actionable insights for the rational design of high&#8208;performance organic Nonlinear optics (NLO) materials with potential applications in advanced photonic devices.

Our experimental and computational findings corroborate that the polarization degree in the ground state, the charge separation in the excited state and twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) collectively dictate the nonlinear optical properties of the compounds. Notably, &lt;b&gt;BTC-1&lt;/b&gt; exhibits an exceptional nonlinear absorption coefficient &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt; value (2&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;8&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;m&#8201;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), attributed to its optimized charge transfer efficiency and pronounced degree of charge separation. Our findings provide actionable insights for the rational design of high-performance organic Nonlinear optics (NLO) materials with potential applications in advanced photonic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Benzothiadiazole&#8208;Based Ordered Mesoporous Polymer as a Versatile, Metal&#8208;Free Heterogeneous Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benzothiadiazole&#8208;functionalized ordered mesoporous polymer (OMP) is synthesized by an evaporation induced self&#8208;assembly (EISA) approach, which is used as a versatile heterogeneous photocatalyst for a wide variety of organic transformations (six reactions). This work suggests a new avenue to develop photoactive OMPs as next generation of heterogeneous photocatalysts.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light active heterogeneous organophotocatalysts have recently gained considerable interest in organic synthetic community. Ordered mesoporous polymers (OMPs) are highly promising as heterogeneous alternative to traditional precious metal/organic dyes&#8208;based photocatalysts. Herein, we report the preparation of a benzothiadiazole functionalized OMPs (BT&#8208;MPs) through a &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; strategy. High ordered periodic porosity, large surface area, excellent stability and rational energy&#8208;band structures guarantee the high catalytic activity of BT&#8208;MPs. As a result, at least six conversions, e.&#8201;g., the [3+2] cycloaddition of phenols with olefins, the selective oxidation of sulfides, the C&#8208;3 thiocyanation of indole and the aminothiocyanation of &#946;&#8208;keto ester, could be promoted smoothly by BT&#8208;MPs. In addition, BT&#8208;MPs was readily recovered with well maintaining its photocatalytic activity and could be reused for at least eight times. This study highlights the potential of exploiting photoactive OMPs as recyclable, robust and metal&#8208;free heterogeneous photocatalysts.

         <title>Tweezer Dyads for H&#8208;Bond Assisted Cooperativity in Tandem Uncaging Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>

Tweezer dyads synthesized by click chemistry harness large two&#8208;photon absorption in the NIR region from quadrupolar antenna and enhancement of the uncaging efficiency via electron transfer sensitization leading to very high two&#8208;photon sensitivity.







Abstract
&#8220;Tandem&#8221; uncaging systems, in which a photolabile protecting group (PPG) is sensitized by an energy&#8208;harvesting antenna, may increase the photosensitivity of PPGs by several orders of magnitude for two&#8208;photon (2P) photorelease. Yet, they remain poorly accessible because of arduous multi&#8208;step synthesis. In this work, we design efficient tandem uncaging systems by (i) using a convenient assembly of the building blocks relying on click chemistry, (ii) introducing H&#8208;bonding induced proximity thus facilitating (iii) photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) as a cooperative mechanism. A strong two&#8208;photon absorber electron&#8208;donating quadrupolar antenna and various electron&#8208;accepting PPGs (mDEAC, MNI or MDNI) were clicked stepwise onto a &#8220;tweezer&#8208;shaped&#8221; pyrido&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxylate platform whose H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;stacking abilities were exploited to keep the antenna and the PPGs in close proximity. The different electron&#8208;accepting ability of the PPGs led to dyads with wildly different behaviors. Whilst the MDNI and MNI dyads showed poor dark stability or no photo&#8208;uncaging ability due to their too high electron&#8208;accepting character, the mDEAC dyad benefited from optimum redox potentials to promote PeT and slow down charge recombination, resulting in enhanced uncaging quantum yield (&#934;u=0.38) compared to mDEAC (&#934;u=0.014). This unique combination resulted in large 2P photo&#8208;sensitivity in the near&#8208;infrared window (240&#8197;GM at 710&#8197;nm).

Abstract
Complex oxides Eu2MeO6 (Me&#8211;Mo, W), Eu2W2O9 were obtained by a solid&#8208;phase reaction between binary oxides. The thermodynamic and kinetic mechanisms of the reaction processes were established using a variety of physical&#8208;chemical methods. All compounds obtained in this work crystallize in the low&#8208;symmetry monoclinic system, forming complex framework structures, which determine a set of very valuable physical&#8208;chemical properties. Comparison of experimental Kubelka&#8208;Munk functions and DFT&#8208; calculated absorption spectra shows adequate agreement and reveals the origin of the fundamental absorption. In addition, the deficiency in DFT calculations in the part of mutual contribution of CTBs of Mo&#8722;O and W&#8722;O, from one side, and Eu&#8722;O contributions, from the other side, is reported. Calculations of absorption spectra are shown to be superior to band structure analysis in the determination of optical band gaps. Additionally, luminescent properties of Eu2MeO6 and Eu2W2O9 compounds were investigated. These studies provide a better understanding of the electronic and optical properties of the compounds Eu2MeO6 and Eu2W2O9, along with their potential applications in various areas.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding in Selective Recognition and Liquid&#8208;Liquid Extraction of Perrhenate</title>

Potent tetrapodal Se&#8208;based ChB receptors selectively extract ReO4&#8722; from 100&#8201;% water medium, employing both precipitation and LLE method.







Abstract
Efficient recognition and extraction of hazardous anionic pollutants from water medium is of great significance for environmental concerns, representing a challenging area of research in supramolecular chemistry. In this study, we present, for the first time, a comprehensive demonstration of the ability of chalcogen bonding (ChB) to recognize and remove the ReO4&#8722; from 100&#8201;% water medium. The anion recognition ability is well elucidated through solution phase NMR and ITC studies, which clearly reveal the selective binding of ReO4&#8722; over other oxo&#8208;anions. Moreover, the selenoimidazolium scaffold effectively engages in Se&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O ChB interaction with ReO4&#8722; as confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystal structure and XPS analysis. More importantly, the binding of ReO4&#8722; with different prolongations of the &#963;&#8211;holes, along with Se&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;Se chalcogen bonding interactions, lead to the formation of a 1D supramolecular assembly. Eventually, ChB receptor Se4Me&#8722;Br exhibits ~62&#8201;% ReO4&#8722; extraction efficiency through precipitation as the extraction method. Furthermore, in efforts to enhance efficiency, a hydrophobic ChB receptor Se4Do&#8208;PF6 has been prepared, achieving an efficiency of up to ~93&#8201;% at a very low concentration (~5&#8197;ppm) by liquid&#8208;liquid extraction.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; over other oxo-anions. Moreover, the selenoimidazolium scaffold effectively engages in Se&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O ChB interaction with ReO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; as confirmed by X-ray crystal structure and XPS analysis. More importantly, the binding of ReO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; with different prolongations of the &#963;&#8211;holes, along with Se&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;Se chalcogen bonding interactions, lead to the formation of a 1D supramolecular assembly. Eventually, ChB receptor Se&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Me&#8722;Br exhibits ~62&#8201;% ReO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; extraction efficiency through precipitation as the extraction method. Furthermore, in efforts to enhance efficiency, a hydrophobic ChB receptor Se&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Do-PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; has been prepared, achieving an efficiency of up to ~93&#8201;% at a very low concentration (~5&#8197;ppm) by liquid-liquid extraction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>N&#8208;Vacancy Enriched Porous BN Fibers for Enhanced Polysulfides Adsorption and Conversion in High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>

This work presented herein centers on the fabrication of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) BN fibers with abundant pores and sufficient N&#8208;vacancy defects, achieved through a unique strategy of thermal crystallization following a pre&#8208;condensation step. After incorporating these fibers with highly interweaved bacterial cellulose (BC) followed by carbonization, the resulting Nv&#8208;BN@CBC exhibited higher specific capacity, superior rate capability, and more stable cycling performance.







Abstract
Severe shuttle effect of soluble polysulfides and sluggish redox kinetics have been thought of as the critical issues hindering the extensive applications of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Herein, one&#8208;dimensional boron nitride (1D BN) fibers with abundant pores and sufficient N&#8208;vacancy defects were synthesized using a thermal crystallization following a pre&#8208;condensation step. The 1D structure of BN facilitates unblocked ions diffusion pathways during charge/discharge cycles. The embedded pores within the polar BN strengthen the immobilization of polysulfides via both physical confinement and chemical interaction. Moreover, the highly exposed active surface area and intentionally created N&#8208;vacancy sites substantially promote reaction kinetics by lowering the energy barriers of the rate&#8208;limiting steps. After incorporating with conductive carbon networks and elemental S, the as&#8208;prepared S/Nv&#8208;BN@CBC cathode of LSBs deliver an initial discharge capacity of up to 1347&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, while maintaining a low decay rate of 0.03&#8201;% per cycle over 1000&#8197;cycles at 1600&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. This work offers an effective strategy to mitigate the shuttle effect and highlights the significant potential of defect&#8208;engineered BN in accelerating the reaction kinetics of LSBs.

         <title>Investigating the Catalytic Site of Human 15&#8208;Lipoxygenase&#8208;1&#8201;via Marine Natural Products</title>

Human 15&#8208;lipoxygenase&#8208;1 is an enzyme with a key role in various diseases. We developed a library of chiral smart molecules to explore, navigate and inhibit this enzyme, integrating specific structural elements from marine&#8208;derived natural product phosphoeleganin (PE) and synthetic fragment derivatives. These PE&#8208;based inhibitors exhibit time&#8208;dependent inhibition and varying potency based on stereochemistry and warhead positioning.







Abstract
Human 15&#8208;lipoxygenase&#8208;1 (15&#8208;LOX&#8208;1) is a key enzyme that possesses an important role in (neuro)inflammatory diseases. The pocket of the enzyme plays the role of a chiral catalyst, and therefore chirality could be an important component for the design of effective enzyme inhibitors. To advance our knowledge on this concept, we developed a library of the identified chiral 15&#8208;LOX&#8208;1 inhibitors and applied cheminformatic tools. Our analysis highlighted specific structural elements, which we integrated them in small molecules, and employed them as &#8220;smart&#8221; tools to effectively navigate the chemical space of previously unexplored regions. To this purpose, we utilized the marine derived natural product phosphoeleganin (PE) among with a small library of synthetic fragment derivatives, including a certain degree of stereochemical diversity. Enzyme inhibition/kinetic and molecular modelling studies has been performed in order to characterize structurally novel PE&#8208;based inhibitors, which proved to present a different type of inhibition with low micromolar potency, according to their structural features. We demonstrate that different warheads work as anchor, and either guide specific stereochemistry, or causing a time&#8208;depended inhibition. Finally, we prove that the positioning of the chiral substituents or/and the favorable stereochemistry can be crucial, as it can lead from active to completely inactive compounds.

Acid&#8208;induced reduction of &#951;2&#8208;bound NO2&#8722; to NO(g) on CoII&#8722;CoII centers in a hetero&#8208;bimetallic CuII&#8208;nitrito&#8208;CoII complex, [(LN8H)CuII&#8722;NO2&#8722;&#8722;CoII]3+ (CuII&#8722;NO2&#8722;&#8722;CoII) bearing an octadentate N8&#8208;cryptand ligand (LN8H) via a proposed nitrous acid [(LN8H)CuII&#8722;ONOH&#8722;CoII]4+ ([Cu(ONOH)Co]+4) intermediate species.







Abstract
Nitrite (NO2&#8722;) serves as a pool of nitric oxide (NO) in biological systems under hypoxic conditions, and it is transformed to NO by nitrite reductase (NiR) enzyme in the presence of acid (H+ ions). However, NO synthases (NOSs) generate NO via L&#8208;arginine oxidation in normoxic conditions. Previously, acid&#8208;induced NO2&#8722; reduction chemistry was modeled on mono&#8208;metallic 3d&#8208;metals, generating metal&#8208;nitrosyls or NO(g) with H2O or H2O2 products. Herein, to understand the relative potency of a bimetallic system, we report the acid&#8208;induced reductive conversion of &#951;2&#8208;bound NO2&#8722; to NO on CuII&#8722;CoII centers of a hetero&#8208;bimetallic CuII&#8208;nitrito&#8208;CoII complex, [(LN8H)CuII&#8722;NO2&#8722;&#8722;CoII]3+ (CuII&#8722;NO2&#8722;&#8722;CoII, 2) bearing an octadentate N8&#8208;cryptand ligand (LN8H). The CuII&#8722;NO2&#8722;&#8722;CoII generates [CuII(LN8H)CoII]4+ (1) upon reaction with one equiv. acid (HClO4, H+ ions source) with NO(g) via a presumed transient nitrousacid (ONOH) intermediate species. Likewise, this NO2&#8722; reduction was found to form H2O, which is believed to be from the decomposition of H2O2, an intermediate species. In addition, complex 2, in the presence of more than one equiv. H+ ions also showed the formation of NO(g) with H2O. Mechanistic investigations, using 15N&#8208;labeled&#8208;15NO2&#8722;, 18O&#8208;labeled&#8208;18O14N16O&#8722; and 2H&#8208;labeled&#8208;DClO4 (D+ source), revealed that the N&#8208;atom and O&#8208;atom in the 14/15NO and 14N18O gases are derived from NO2&#8722; ligand and H&#8208;atom in H2O derived from H+&#8208;source, respectively.

         <title>Cascade C&#8722;H Activation and Two C&#8722;C Bond Forming in Reaction of Azalutetacyclopentadiene with 2&#8208;Methylbenzonitriles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of azalutetacyclopentadiene toward 2&#8208;methylbenzonitriles provides a series of fused 7&#8211;5&#8208;6&#8208;membered azalutetacycle products. Mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction proceeds through three steps: the activation of the benzylic C&#8722;H bond, followed by the first intramolecular nucleophilic attack to form the first new C&#8722;C bond, and then the intramolecular nucleophilic attack of uncoordinated carbanion toward C=N triple bond. Two new C&#8722;C bonds are formed in the highly selective three&#8208;step cascade transformation.







Abstract
Azametallacyclopentadienes are an important class of metallacycles as the key intermediates in metal&#8208;promoted or catalyzed carbon&#8208;carbon coupling reaction of nitriles and alkynes. Rare&#8208;earth azametallacyclopentadienes have shown various reactivity toward nitriles, depending on the substituents of nitriles. The reaction of azalutetacyclopentadienes toward 2&#8208;methylbenzonitriles has been investigated in this work, which selectively affords the fused 7&#8208;5&#8208;6&#8208;membered azalutetacycles as products. Computational studies reveal that the reaction of azalutetacyclopentadienes toward 2&#8208;methylbenzonitriles selectively initiates with the remote activation of the benzylic C&#8722;H bond by the Lu&#8722;N bond, followed by the intramolecular nucleophilic attack from the deprotonated benzylic carbon to form a C&#8722;C bond. Subsequently, the high ring strain promoted the generation of the uncoordinated carbanion dissociated from the lutetium center, which then undergoes intramolecular nucleophilic attack toward C=N triple bond to give the final product containing fused 7&#8208;5&#8208;6&#8208;membered azalutetacycle. This work not only achieves highly selective three&#8208;step cascade reaction to form a unique class of rare&#8208;earth metallacycle, but also provides a new idea for the transformation of unsaturated substrates with C&#8722;H bonds that can be activated.

         <title>A Well&#8208;Defined Magnesium Complex of C706&#8722;</title>

         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;defined soluble magnesium complex of the C706&#8722; ion has been prepared and characterised, and the various global and local changes to structure, charges and orbitals as a result of reduction and countercation coordination are discussed.







Abstract
Controlling and understanding charge state and metal coordination in carbon nanomaterials is crucial to harnessing their unique properties. Here we describe the synthesis of the well&#8208;defined fulleride complex [{(Mesnacnac)Mg}6C70], 2, (Mesnacnac)=HC(MeCNMes)2, Mes=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2, from the reaction of the &#946;&#8208;diketiminate magnesium(I) complex [{(Mesnacnac)Mg}2] with C70 in aromatic solvents. The molecular structure of complex 2 was determined, providing the first high&#8208;quality structural study of a complex with the C706&#8722; ion. In combination with solution state NMR spectroscopic and DFT computational studies, the changes in geometry and charge distribution in the various atom and bond types of the fulleride unit were investigated. Additionally, the influence of the (Mesnacnac)Mg+ cations on the global and local fulleride coordination environment was examined.

         <title>Aliphatic Ketone Claisen Rearrangement: Troubleshooting the Transetherification Step by Identifying a Stable Acid Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple catalyst for the ketone Claisen rearrangement. By optimizing the benzoic acid catalysts for the Claisen rearrangement sequence that starts with allylic alcohols and enol ethers or ketone acetals, 4&#8208;chlorobenzoic acid catalyst emerged as a catalyst that retains its activity in the process. This catalyst enables ketone Claisen reactions with even acid&#8208; and heat&#8208;sensitive protecting groups, such as tert&#8208;butoxycarbonylamines (BocNH), or tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) ethers.







Abstract
After optimization for retention of catalytic activity, 4&#8208;chlorobenzoic acid emerged as the optimal catalyst for the aliphatic ketone Claisen rearrangement. The optimal catalyst enables a one&#8208;pot, metal&#8208;free, catalytic protocol from allylic alcohols to &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. The optimized process tolerates a range of substrates, including substituents with acid&#8208;labile protecting groups. Reaction monitoring and DFT studies of the aliphatic ketone Claisen process agree that the ultimate rearrangement step typically has the highest activation barrier.

         <title>De&#8208; and Rearomatisation of Pyridine in Silylene Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dearomatisation process of pyridine is facilitated by the metal&#8208;free reactions of pyridylamino&#8208;functionalized silylene with benzophenone or acetophenone. The former resulting product can undergo further rearomatisation of pyridine upon heating. Both steric hindrance and aromatic groups collectively influence the dearomatisation of pyridine in pyridylaminosilylene reactions.







Abstract
Traditional methods relying on metal&#8208;ligand cooperation for activating pyridine bonds in de&#8208; and rearomatisation are being challenged by the abundant metal&#8208;free element species as alternatives. Here, we investigated the de/re&#8208;aromatisation of pyridine facilitated by pyridylamino&#8208;functionalised silylene reactions with ketones and ketene. The reactivity outcome is highly dependent on the substituents on the ketones. By carefully tuning the steric demand of the ketone, each intermediate of the reaction sequence could be isolated. At room temperature, benzophenone and acetophenone substrates led to dearomatisation of the pyridine moiety, with the case of acetophenone showing an intermediate silaoxirane preceding dearomatisation. However, when subjected to acetone or diphenylketene, only silaoxiranes were formed without dearomatisation of the pyridine moiety. Notably, only benzophenone&#8208;derived dearomatised species demonstrated rearomatisation upon heating. Furthermore, the reduced steric bulk of the ketene facilitated further ring expansion with another equivalent of the substrate, forming sila&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolanes. Both steric hindrance and aromatic groups collectively influence the dearomatisation of pyridine in pyridylaminosilylene reactions.

         <title>Unveiling the Influence of Brightness Heterogeneity in Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy of Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>

Through advanced PIE&#8208;FCS and blinking studies, we investigated the FCS behaviors of nanoparticles with single&#8208;photon purity. Our findings reveal that several FCS characteristics, such as reduced g2(0) amplitude and extended diffusion time at high pump intensity, stem from brightness heterogeneity, which is, light&#8208;induced ON/OFF blinking of individual nanoparticles.







Abstract
Nanoparticles (NPs), including perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) with single photon purity, present challenges in fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) studies due to their distinct photoluminescence (PL) behaviors. In particular, the zero&#8208;time correlation amplitude [g2(0)] and the associated diffusion timescale (&#964;D) of their FCS curves show substantial dependency on pump intensity (IP). Optical saturation inadequately explains the origin of this FCS phenomenon in NPs, thus setting them apart from conventional dye molecules, which do not manifest such behavior. This observation is apparently attributed to either photo&#8208;brightening or optical trapping, both lead to increased NP occupancy (N) in the excitation volume, consequently reducing the g2(0) amplitude [since g2(0) &#945; 1/N] at high IP. However, an advanced FCS study utilizing alternating laser excitation at two different intensities dismisses such possibilities. Further investigation into single&#8208;particle blinking behaviors as a function of IP reveals that the intensity dependence of g2(0) primarily arises from the brightness heterogeneity prevalent in almost all types of NPs. This report delves into the complexities of the photophysical properties of NPs and their adverse impacts on FCS studies.

         <title>Asymmetric Kinetic Resolution Polymerization of Racemic Lactide Mediated by Axial&#8208;Chiral Thiourea/Phosphazene Binary Organocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The simple and effective binary organocatalytic pairs, associating axial&#8208;chiral thiourea organocatalysts and phosphazene bases, allow for both high polymerization activity and moderate enantioselectivity (kD/kL=18.1) for the AKRP of rac&#8208;LA at room temperature, yielding semi&#8208;crystalline and metal&#8208;free stereoblock PLA with a melting temperature as high as 186&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Asymmetric kinetic resolution polymerization (AKRP) provides an ideal way to obtain highly isotactic polylactide (PLA) with superior thermal&#8208;mechanical properties from racemic lactide (rac&#8208;LA). However, the development of a new catalytic system with concurrent high activity and selectivity at ambient temperature remains a great callenge. Here, a series of simple and effective binary organocatalytic pairs containing axial&#8208;chiral thioureas and commercially available phosphazene bases were designed. These chiral binary organocatalytic pairs allow for both high polymerization activity and moderate enantioselectivity for AKRP of rac&#8208;LA at room temperature, yielding semi&#8208;crystalline and metal&#8208;free stereoblock PLA with a melting temperature as high as 186&#8201;&#176;C. The highest kinetic resolution coefficient (krel) of 8.5 at 47&#8201;% conversion was obtained, and D&#8208;LA was preferentially polymerized via kinetic resolution with a maximum selectivity factor (kD/kL) of 18.1, indicating that an enantiomorphic site control mechanism (ESC) was involved.

A novel, machine learning&#8208;assisted, high&#8208;throughput method for synthesizing metal nanoclusters is unveiled. The developed approach not only fast&#8208;tracks the discovery of such nanoclusters but also enhances synthesis efficiency. A myriad of different nanoclusters were successfully created, including Au41Cu66, Au40Cu34, Au18Cu32, Au18, Au6Cu6, and Cu&#8722;NC nanoclusters. This study underscores the role of high&#8208;throughput screening as a fundamental tool in pushing the boundaries of nanocluster research.

Complex oxides Eu2MeO6 (Me=Mo, W) and Eu2W2O9 were obtained in a solid&#8208;phase reaction between binary oxides. The thermodynamic and kinetic mechanisms of the reaction processes were established by using a variety of physicochemical methods. Calculations of absorption spectra are shown to be superior to band structure analysis in the determination of optical band gaps. In this work, the experimental data are in good agreement with the theoretical models. More information can be found in the Research Article by Yu.&#8197;G.

Our characterized charged fracture planes, a crucial phenomenon for triboluminescence, are shown by using molecular networking and electrostatic potential. The lightning between the planes symbolizes the energy released from disrupted electrostatic interactions during fracturing, harnessed for triboluminescence. The background photographs depict single crystals (left) and their emission during fracturing (triboluminescence, right), as investigated in our study.

         <title>Cover Feature: De&#8208; and Rearomatisation of Pyridine in Silylene Chemistry (Chem. Eur. J. 53/2024)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a novel method for the dearomatisation of pyridine through metal&#8208;free reactions of pyridylamino&#8208;functionalised silylene with benzophenone or acetophenone that challenges traditional metal&#8211;ligand approaches. Notably, the product formed with benzophenone can undergo rearomatisation upon heating. Both steric hindrance and aromatic groups play critical roles in the dearomatisation process within pyridylaminosilylene reactions. More information can be found in the Research Article by X. Sun, P. Roesky and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202402456). Artwork by Chenxin Li and Da Jin.

         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of a Mn(II)&#8208;based coordination polymer (CP); and its structure, phase consistency and thermal stability have been established by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD), powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and thermalgravimetric analysis (TGA) respectively. This is the first example of paramgnetic Mn(II)&#8208;based CP that acts as pH&#8208;dependent emitting material [lem= 525 nm (pH = 2.0&#8208;4.0) and 450 nm (pH = 5.0&#8208;12.0)]. Its emission is quenched by Pd2+ in aqueous medium in presence of other thirteen cations with reasonably low pH&#8208;dependent limits of detection (LODs) [21.178 ppb (pH= 3), 15.005 ppb (pH = 7.0) and 59.940 ppb (pH = 10.0)] as described by well&#8208;established mechanism. Therefore, urgency of such stable sensor remains high in regard to the environmental pollution.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Stability and Kinetics of Dioxazaborocanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We investigated the equilibrium reaction of boronic acid (BA), diethanolamines (DEA), and 1,3,6,2&#8208;dioxazaborocanes (DOAB) in aqueous solutions, both theoretically and experimentally. Our findings show that the association constant can be adjusted by substituting BA and DEA derivatives, ranging from 100 to 103 M&#8722;1, exhibiting a bell&#8208;shaped pH dependency. The highest stability was achieved when the pKa values of DEA and BA were closely matched. This approach enabled the preparation of a highly stable DOAB under physiological conditions. Furthermore, the hydrolysis kinetics of DOABs were controllable over a range of five orders of magnitude based on the substituent&#8217;s steric effect. In the slowest case, this resulted in quasi&#8208;static stability with only 1% cleavage in the first hour, followed by a week&#8208;long cleavage period to reach equilibrium. These insights could establish a unique chemistry platform for designing scheduled cleavability on a day&#8208;to&#8208;week timescale, relevant to protein engineering, immunotherapy, and other smart drug delivery applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphonium SF5&#8722; Salts Derived from Sulfur Hexafluoride as Deoxyfluorination Reagents</title>

         <dc:description>
Sulfur hexafluoride valorization with phosphines affords crystalline phosphonium SF5&#8722; salts that are used as deoxyfluorination reagents.







Abstract
Sulfur based deoxyfluorination reagents are usually derived from the corrosive gas SF4. Herein, we report the synthesis and properties of an easily accessible phosphonium salt [(tmg)3PF]+SF5&#8722; (1) which was obtained from the reaction of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) with tris(tetramethylguanidinyl)phosphine. The performance of this crystalline SF5&#8722; salt as a reagent in deoxyfluorination reactions was investigated together with a second SF5&#8722; salt [(R1)3PF]+SF5&#8722; (2) containing bulky substituents (R1=1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylimidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenamino). Both reagents proved to be effective for the deoxyfluorination of various functional groups including alcohols, anhydrides, and amides.

         <title>Surface Plasmon Resonance Allows to Correlate Molecular Properties With Diffusion Coefficients of Linear Chain Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a new model to describe and fit the behavior of diffusion coefficients (D) as a function of molecular structure and thermodynamic parameters in binary solutions of linear chain organic molecules. The model is validated using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for a series of n&#8208;alcohols, revealing a strong dependence of D on molecular shape and solute&#8208;solvent interactions.

         <title>Tracking Microenvironmental Response on Self&#8208;Assembled Phthalocyanine Systems &#8211; Adaptive and Non&#8208;Adaptive Antibacterial Photosensitization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study using steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved fluorescence measurements, we investigate how self&#8208;assembled photosensitizers respond to changes in molecular crowding and presence of different bacteria. We observed that certain systems exhibit adaptive behavior and alter their photoinduced activity, while others do not, highlighting the impact of confined environments and intermolecular interactions on the relaxation pathways of excited states in photoactive molecules.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly has proven to be one of the effective methods for the formation of nanoscale therapeutics without the need to use nanodelivery systems. Such minimal models of supramolecular systems formed from amphiphilic photosensitizers (PS) have recently emerged as a new class of photoactive systems, providing unique and in some cases superior activities. Although the mechanism of photogenerated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in such systems is studied and to a certain extent understood, there are very limited studies investigating the influence of intricate environmental factors, including those occurring in the cellular environment, on the self&#8208;assembly and thus the activity of the system. Understanding the optimal conditions for the formation of active PS aggregates is an important area of research in the field of photodynamic therapy (PDT), as it is directly linked to the optimal treatment dose. In this study, we describe the synthesis, self&#8208;assembly properties, photophysical characterization, and photobiological efficacy of structurally closely related low&#8208;symmetry phthalocyanine derivatives. Studying the decay behavior of the PS fluorescence lifetime in the presence of molecular crowders and different bacterial strains, we found that certain derivatives exhibited adaptive behavior and change in activity, while others demonstrated non&#8208;adaptive characteristics.

&lt;p&gt;Self-assembly has proven to be one of the effective methods for the formation of nanoscale therapeutics without the need to use nanodelivery systems. Such minimal models of supramolecular systems formed from amphiphilic photosensitizers (PS) have recently emerged as a new class of photoactive systems, providing unique and in some cases superior activities. Although the mechanism of photogenerated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in such systems is studied and to a certain extent understood, there are very limited studies investigating the influence of intricate environmental factors, including those occurring in the cellular environment, on the self-assembly and thus the activity of the system. Understanding the optimal conditions for the formation of active PS aggregates is an important area of research in the field of photodynamic therapy (PDT), as it is directly linked to the optimal treatment dose. In this study, we describe the synthesis, self-assembly properties, photophysical characterization, and photobiological efficacy of structurally closely related low-symmetry phthalocyanine derivatives. Studying the decay behavior of the PS fluorescence lifetime in the presence of molecular crowders and different bacterial strains, we found that certain derivatives exhibited adaptive behavior and change in activity, while others demonstrated non-adaptive characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Improved Electrochemical Peptide Synthesis Enabled by Electron&#8208;Rich Triaryl Phosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tris(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl) phosphine enable the electrochemical synthesis of peptides which are difficult with the previously reported method using triphenyl phosphine. In addition, this phosphine has a potential to be a recyclable coupling reagent. This study also presents that substituents on phosphines influence the reactivity of phosphine (radical) cation and have an important role in avoiding side reactions.







Abstract
While remarkable progress has been made in the development of peptide medicines, many problems related to peptide synthesis remain unresolved. Previously, we reported electrochemical peptide synthesis using a phosphine as a potentially recyclable coupling reagent. However, there was room for improvement from the point of view of reaction efficiency, especially in the carboxylic acid activation step and the peptide bond formation step. To overcome these challenges, we searched for the optimal phosphine. Among phosphines with various electronic properties, we found that electron&#8208;rich triaryl phosphines improved the reaction efficiency. Consequently, we successfully performed electrochemical peptide synthesis on sterically hindered and valuable amino acids. We also synthesized oligopeptides that were challenging with our previous method. Finally, we examined the effect of substituents on the phosphine cations, and gained some insights into reactivity, which will aid researchers designing reactions involving phosphine cations.

         <title>Cobalt Nanoparticles Catalyzed N&#8208;Heterocycles Synthesis via Acceptorless Dehydrogenative Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient Co&#8722;Si/CN catalyst derived from MOFs/SiO2 composite was prepared using a one&#8208;step assembly process involving pyrolysis and etching. This catalyst exhibited outstanding catalytic activity in the synthesis of quinoline and pyridine derivatives through acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of 2&#8208;aminoalcohols with secondary alcohols.







Abstract
The acceptorless dehydrogenation reaction is a sustainable and atom&#8208;economical methodology in organic synthesis, resulting in the byproducts of only hydrogen or water. Herein, a robust Co&#8722;Si/CN catalyst (derived from ZIF@SiO2 composite) has been synthesized through a one&#8208;step assembly process via pyrolysis and etching. This catalyst has been employed for the acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of 2&#8208;aminoalcohols with secondary alcohols, enabling efficient conversion of various substrates into desired quinoline or pyridine derivatives with a yield of up to 94&#8201;%.

         <title>One&#8208;pot Functionalization for the Preparation of Cobaltocene&#8208;Modified Redox&#8208;Responsive Porous Microparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The convenient modification of microparticles with cobaltocenium moieties is described by taking advantage of a hydroamination reaction with a metal&#8208;containing acetylene derivative. The high accuracy of this technique opens the way to tailored stimuli&#8208;responsive spheres showing reversible redox&#8208;addressability over high cycling numbers. The herein&#8208;presented metallopolymer&#8208;based particles can also be converted to porous ceramics.







Abstract
Porous organic cobaltocenium&#8208;containing particles are scarce in literature but highly interesting for their electrochemical properties and reusability in, for example, catalysis or magnetic systems. In this work, we present a scalable one&#8208;pot strategy to introduce tailorable amounts of cobaltocenium on a porous substrate, adjusting the electrochemical switching capability. For this purpose, 3&#8208;(triethoxysilyl)propan&#8208;1&#8208;amine (APTES) and ethynyl cobaltocenium hexafluorophosphate is used as functionalization agents for in&#8208;situ catalyst&#8208;free hydroamination, followed by silane condensation at the particles&#8217; surface. Functionalized particles are characterized by attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDS), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS), powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) showing excellent control over the degree of functionalization, i.&#8201;e., the added cobaltocenium reagents. The electrochemical stability and good addressability while preserving the porous structure are shown. By utilizing higher amounts of APTES, the overall cobaltocenium amount can be reduced in favor of additional amine groups, strongly affecting the electrochemical behavior, making this functionalization strategy a good platform for metallopolymer immobilization and tailored functionalization. Additionally, thermal treatment of the synthesized metallopolymer microparticles paves the way to magnetic properties with tailorable microporous architectures for end&#8208;of&#8208;life and upcycling aspects.

         <title>Mapping Electrophile Chemoselectivity in DalPhos/Nickel N&#8208;Arylation Catalysis: The Unusual Influence of Remote Sterics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclose herein our evaluation of competitive (hetero)aryl&#8208;X (X: Br &gt; Cl &gt; OTf) reactivity preferences in bisphosphine/Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;N cross&#8208;coupling catalysis, using furfurylamine as a prototypical nucleophile, and employing DalPhos and DPPF as representative ancillary ligands with established efficacy. Beyond this general (pseudo)halide ranking, other intriguing structure&#8208;reactivity trends were noted experimentally, including the unexpected observation that bulky alkyl (e.g., R = tBu) substitution in para&#8208;R&#8208;aryl&#8208;X electrophiles strongly discourages (pseudo)halide reactivity relative to smaller substituents (e.g., nBu, Et, Me), despite being both remote from, and having a similar electronic influence on, the reacting C&#8208;X bond; such effects on nickel oxidative addition have not been documented previously and were not observed in our comparator reactions presented herein involving palladium. Density functional theory modeling of such PhPAd&#8208;DalPhos/Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;N cross&#8208;couplings revealed the origins of competitive turnover of C&#8208;Br over C&#8208;Cl, and possible ways in which bulky para&#8208;alkyl substitution might discourage net electrophile uptake/turnover, leading to inversion of halide selectivity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The addition of Grignard reagents to ketones is a well&#8208;established textbook reaction. However, a comprehensive understanding of its mechanism has only recently begun to emerge. X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, because of its high selectivity and sensitivity, is the ideal tool for distinguishing between an ensemble of competing pathways.&#160;With this aim in mind, we investigated the concerted mechanism of the addition of methylmagnesium chloride (CH$_3$MgCl) to acetone in tetrahydrofuran by simulating the X&#8208;ray spectra of different molecules in solution. We used electronic structure methods to calculate the X&#8208;ray absorption spectra at the Mg K&#8208; and L$_1$&#8208;edges and the X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra at the Mg K&#8208;edge for different organomagnesium species, which coexist in solution due to the Schlenk equilibrium.&#160;The simulated spectra show that individual species can be distinguished throughout the different stages of the reaction.Each species has a distinct spectral feature which can be used as a fingerprint in solution. The absorption and photoelectron spectra consistently show a blue shift as the reaction progressed from reagents to products.</dc:description>

Isolated adducts of Ga(OTeF5)3 with strong and weak Lewis bases have been characterized spectroscopically as well as single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry. The Lewis acidity of this new species has been evaluated by means of different experimental and theoretical methods, which has allowed to classify it as one of only a few examples of a gallium&#8208;based Lewis superacid. The high Lewis acidity of Ga(OTeF5)3 was used to amplify the strength of the Br&#248;nsted acid HOTeF5, leading to the protonation of diethyl ether. Furthermore, Ga(OTeF5)3 was utilized to access the strong oxidizing system Ga(OTeF5)3/Xe(OTeF5)2 in SO2ClF, which was successfully employed in the synthesis of the dimethyl chloronium salt [Cl(CH3)2][Ga(OTeF5)4], a strong electrophilic methylation reagent.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The reaction of [Ga(C2F5)3(FSiMe3)] with chlorotrimethylsilane leads to the selective substitution of the&#160;&#945;&#8208;fluorine atoms by chlorine atoms and thus to the formation of [Ga(CCl2CF3)3(FSiMe3)]. The corresponding chlorogallate ion, [Ga(CCl2CF3)3Cl]&#8211;, could be isolated and structurally characterized as its tetraphenylphosphonium salt. The catalytic potential of [Ga(CCl2CF3)3(FSiMe3)] was demonstrated via the chlorodefluorination of Me3SiCF3, 2,2&#8208;difluoropropane and [PPh4][Ga(C2F5)4].</dc:description>

         <title>Axial Coordination Engineering on Fe&#8210;N&#8210;C Materials for Oxygen Reduction: Insights from Theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axial coordination engineering has emerged as an effective strategy to regulate the catalytic performance of metal&#8210;N&#8210;C materials for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the ORR mechanism and activity changes of their active centers modified by axial ligands are still unclear. Here, a comprehensive investigation of the ORR on a series of FeN4&#8210;L moieties (L stands for an axial ligand) is performed using advanced density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The axial ligand has a substantial effect on the electronic structure and catalytic activity of the FeN4 center. Specially, FeN4&#8210;C6H5 is screened as a promising active moiety with superior ORR activity, as further revealed by constant&#8208;potential calculations and kinetic analysis. The enhanced activity is attributed to the weakened *OH adsorption caused by the altered electronic structure. Moreover, microkinetic modeling shows that at pH = 1, FeN4&#8210;C6H5 possesses an impressive theoretical half&#8208;wave potential of ~1.01 V, superior to the pristine Fe&#8210;N&#8210;C catalysts (~0.88 V) calculated at the same level. These findings advance the understanding of the ORR mechanism of FeN4&#8210;L and provide guidance for optimizing the ORR performance of single&#8208;metal&#8208;atom catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>An imine&#8208;functionalized silicone&#8208;based epoxy coating with stable adhesion and controllable degradation for enhanced marine antifouling and anticorrosion properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biofouling and corrosion of submerged equipment caused by marine organisms severely restrict the rapid development of the marine industry. Traditional antifouling or anticorrosion coatings typically serve a sole purpose and exhibit limited degradability upon failure, rendering them inadequate for current demands. Herein, a novel imine&#8208;functionalized command&#8208;degradable bio&#8208;based epoxy coating (SAHPEP&#8208;DDM) with enhanced integrated antifouling and anticorrosion performances was synthesized utilizing 1,3&#8208;bis (3&#8208;aminopropyl)&#8208;1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethyldisiloxane and syringaldehyde. Compared with commercial epoxy resins (E51&#8208;DDM) and polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS), the SAHPEP&#8208;DDM coating exhibits superior antifouling and anticorrosion properties due to the existence of &#8208;C=N&#8208; and Si&#8208;O&#8208;Si chain segments in the cross&#8208;linking network. The coating&#160;shows promising resistance against bacteria, algae and proteins, as well as excellent corrosion resistance in artificial seawater. The coating also exhibits excellent chemical resistance in organic solvents as well as neutral and alkaline environments. Moreover, its controlled degradation after&#160;failure can be achieved in acid aqueous solutions through temperature and acidity adjustments, facilitated by the presence of &#8208;C=N&#8208;. This work presents a novel degradable coating successfully coupled the dual functions of antifouling and anticorrosion coatings, avoiding the employment of intermediate coat, indicating vast potential for application in&#160;marine engineering fields.</dc:description>

Abstract
An efficient and practical method was developed for the synthesis of C2&#8208;symmetric 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;1&#8208;t&#8208;butyl&#8208;diol ligands. The disclosed synthesis involves the Ullmann homocoupling of a keto bromo&#8208;pyridine under NiCl2/Zn/PPh3 conditions, followed by the stereoselective double hydrogen transfer to the obtained 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;diketone using RuII Noyori&#8211;Ikariya catalysts. This approach allowed the successful synthesis of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;1&#8208;t&#8208;butyl&#8208;diol, i.e (S,S)&#8208;Bolm's ligand, with a quantitative yield and an excellent stereoselectivity (ee&gt;99.5&#8201;%, de&gt;99.5&#8201;%), with an overall yield of 69&#8201;% from easily accessible starting materials.

         <title>Complex Biophysical and Computational Analyses of G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligands: The Porphyrin Stacks Back</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s), as non&#8208;canonical DNA structures, attract a great deal of research interest in the molecular biology as well as in the material science fields. The use of small molecules as ligands for G&#8208;quadruplexes has emerged as a tool to regulate gene expression and telomeres maintenance. Meso&#8208;tetrakis&#8208;(N&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin (TMPyP4) was shown as one of the first ligands for G&#8208;quadruplexes and it is still widely used. We report an investigation comprising molecular docking and dynamics, synthesis and multiple spectroscopic and spectrometric determinations on simple cationic porphyrins and their interaction with different DNA sequences. The study allowed to synthesize a few compounds that have shown to interact with DNA; the detailed characterization has shown that the presence of amide groups at the periphery improves selectivity for parallel G4s binding over other structures. Taking into account the ease of synthesis, 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis&#8208;(1&#8208;acetamido&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin bromide could be considered a better alternative to TMPyP4 in studies involving G4 binding.</dc:description>

         <title>An Electrosynthesis of 1,3,4&#8208;Oxadiazoles from N&#8208;Acyl Hydrazones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole is a widely encountered motif in the areas of pharmaceuticals, materials, and agrochemicals. This work has established a mild, mediated electrochemical synthesis of 2,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazoles from N&#8208;acyl hydrazones. Using DABCO as the optimal redox mediator has enabled a mild oxidative cyclisation, without recourse to stoichiometric oxidants. In contrast to previous methods, this indirect electrochemical oxidation has enabled a broad range of substrates to be accessed, with yields of up to 83%, and on gram scale. The simplicity of the method has been further demonstrated by the development of a one&#8208;pot procedure, directly transforming readily available aldehydes and hydrazides into valuable heterocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide Catalyzed Conjugate Additions to &#946;&#8208;Nitroacrylates &#8211; Steric Bulk Increases the Reaction Rate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The organocatalytic conjugate addition of aldehydes to &#946;&#8208;nitroacrylates provides direct access to &#946;&#8208;ester&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitroaldehydes and, thereby, common structural motifs of many bioactive compounds. However, the deactivation of amine&#8208;based catalysts by alkylation with the highly electrophilic nitroacrylates hampers this reaction. Here, we show that the peptide H&#8208;Mep&#8208;dPro&#8208;dGlu&#8208;NH2, which is reluctant to under alkylation,&#160;catalyzes this reaction at low catalyst loading (0.5&#8211;1 mol%) within short reaction times (15&#8211;60 min) to yield a broad range of &#946;&#8208;ester&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitroaldehydes with high stereoselectivity. Kinetic studies revealed that increased steric bulk on the &#946;&#8208;nitroacrylate enhances the reaction rate by hindering catalyst alkylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Improvement of photocatalytic CO2 reduction with conjugated organic polymers by rational modulation of donor, acceptor and bonding method</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of metal&#8208;free catalysts to convert CO2 into valuable chemicals is very challenging. Here, we synthesized a conjugated organic polymer (TpTf&#8208;1) featuring 2,4,6&#8208;Triphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;Triazine as the acceptor unit, triphenylamine as the donor unit, and vinylidene bond as the linkage. The local structure of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) forms an intramolecular electric field that can promote the separation of photogenerated electrons and charges, meanwhile, the vinylidene bond can further change the charge distribution to promote exciton dissociation. Without the use of photosensitizers, the TpTf&#8208;1 exhibits outstanding selectivity of CO of up to 91.96%, with a production rate of 45.2 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 at visible light, which is 3.4&#8208;fold than TaTf&#8208;1 with the same D&#8208;A structure but linking in imine bond and is 2.8&#8208;fold than TpTf&#8208;2 linking in vinylidene bond but with a different donor unit. Moreover, TpTf&#8208;1 has a CO production rate of up to 117.3 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 under full wavelength light irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton Conduction via Water and Ammonia Coordinated Metal Cationic Species in MOF and MHOF Platforms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and metalo hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (MHOFs) are designed as promising solid&#8208;state proton conductors by incorporating various protonic species intrinsically or extrinsically, design and development of such materials by employing the concept of proton conduction through coordinated polar protic solvent is largely unexplored. Herein, we have constructed two proton&#8208;conducting materials having different solvent coordinated metal cationic species: In&#8208;H2O&#8208;MOF, ({[In(H2O)6][In3(Pzdc)6]&#183;15H2O}n; H2Pzdc: pyrazine&#8208;2,3&#8208;dicarboxylic acid) with coordinated water molecules from hexaaquaindium cationic species, and MHOF&#8208;4, ([{Co(NH3)6}2(2,6&#8208;NDS)2(H2O)2]n; 2,6&#8208;H2NDS: 2,6&#8208;naphthalenedisulfonic acid) with coordinated ammonia from hexaammoniacobalt cationic species. Interestingly, higher proton conductivity was achieved for In&#8208;H2O&#8208;MOF (1.5 &#215; 10&#8208;5 S cm&#8208;1) than MHOF&#8208;4 (6.3 &#215; 10&#8208;6 S cm&#8208;1) under the extreme conditions (80 &#186;C and 95% RH), which could be attributed to enhanced acidity of coordinated water molecules having much lower pKa value than that of coordinated ammonia. Greater charge polarization on hydrogen atoms of In3+&#8208;coordinated water molecules than that of Co2+&#8208;coordinated ammonia led to the high conductivity of In&#8208;H2O&#8208;MOF, as evident by quantum chemical studies. Such a comparative study on metal&#8208;coordinated protic polar solvents in achieving proton conduction in crystalline solids is yet to be made.</dc:description>

         <title>Neptunyl Pyrrophen Complexes: Exploring Schiff Base Chemistry with Multidentate Acyclic Ligands and Transuranics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the first two neptunyl&#8208;pyrrophen compounds. Formerly synthesized with uranyl, these unique hexadentate ligands readily coordinate equatorially with neptunyl ions. The crystal structure is determined, and diffuse reflectance and FTIR spectra are measured. Scrutiny is placed on the NpO2L1 compound which is determined to exist as a mixed valence species of Np(V/VI).







Abstract
We report the synthesis, structure, and characterization of two novel neptunyl complexes (NpO2L1 and NpO2L2) constructed from phenylene&#8208;substituted benzyl ester bis(pyrrole)phenylenediamine (named &#8220;pyrrophen&#8221;) ligands. In both cases, the neptunium center exists in the +6 oxidation state,. As our specific interest is in exploring the chemistry of neptunium compounds containing the linear neptunyl ion (NpO22+) through equatorially coordinating the metal by multidentate organic ligands, we have identified the differences that are likely to cause discrepancy between the two complexes by examining the ions and their coordinative environments through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, diffuse reflectance, and Raman spectroscopy. This is the first time pyrrophen has been utilized in Np chemistry and demonstrates a new platform to study 5&#8201;f electron participation and coordination.

         <title>Recent Toolboxes for Chemoselective Dual Modifications of Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The capacity to synthesize complex protein conjugates functionalized with two or more distinct moieties has revolutionized the field of chemical biology. This review summarizes contemporary chemical biology tools for protein dual chemical modifications, along with the discussion of their respective advantages, limitations, and potential future directions within this rapidly evolving area.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective chemical modifications of proteins have emerged as a potent technology in chemical biology, materials science, and medicine, facilitating precise manipulation of proteins with tailored functionalities for basic biology research and developing innovative therapeutics. Compared to traditional recombinant expression methods, one of the prominent advantages of chemical protein modification lies in its capacity to decorate proteins with a wide range of functional moieties, including non&#8208;genetically encoded ones, enabling the generation of novel protein conjugates with enhanced or previously unexplored properties. Among these, approaches for dual or multiple modifications of proteins are increasingly garnering attention, as it has been found that single modification of proteins is inadequate to meet current demands. Therefore, in light of the rapid developments in this field, this review provides a timely and comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in chemical and biological approaches for dual functionalization of proteins. It further discusses their advantages, limitations, and potential future directions in this relatively nascent area.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Dinitrogen Reduction to Ammonia Using Easily Reducible N&#8208;Fused Cobalt Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New single&#8208;site molecular electrocatalysts, based on easily reducible N&#8208;fused cobalt porphyrins, have been developed for dinitrogen reduction to ammonia. Faradic efficiencies have been achieved in the 6&#8211;7.5&#8201;% range with ammonia yield rates of 300&#8211;340&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at room temperature and neutral pH conditions. Mild reaction conditions for dinitrogen electro&#8208;reduction are accomplished.







Abstract
Single&#8208;site molecular electrocatalysts, especially those that perform catalytic conversion of N2 to NH3 under mild conditions, are highly desirable to derive fundamental structure&#8208;activity relations and as potential alternatives to the current energy&#8208;consuming Haber&#8208;Bosch ammonia production process. Combining theoretical calculations with experimental evidence, it has been shown that easily reducible cobalt porphyrins catalyze the six&#8208;electron, six&#8208;proton reduction of dinitrogen to NH3 at neutral pH and under ambient conditions. Two easily reducible N&#8208;fused cobalt porphyrins &#8211; CoNHF and CoNHF(Br)2 &#8211; reveal NRR activity with Faradic efficiencies between 6&#8211;7.5&#8201;% with ammonia yield rates of 300&#8211;340&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Contrary to this, much harder&#8208;to&#8208;reduce N&#8208;fused porphyrins &#8211; CoNHF(Ph)2 and CoNHF(PE)2 &#8211; reveal no NRR activity. The present study highlights the significance of tuning the redox and structural properties of single&#8208;site NRR electrocatalysts for improved NRR activity under mild conditions.

         <title>Neutral and Anion Species of Quinoidal Thienothiophene Diketopyrrolopyrroles Display a Common Aggregation Mode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diketopyrrolopyrrol quinoidal oligomers aggregate in a very similar way in the neutral state and in the dimer dianion states due to an uniform distribution of the electron charge excess between the two molecules in the dimer dianion.







Abstract
A comprehensive investigation of two new molecular triads incorporating the diketopyrrolopyrrole unit into a quinoidized thienothiophene skeleton, which is further end&#8208;capped with dicyanomethylene (DPP&#8208;TT&#8208;CN) or phenoxyl groups (DPP&#8208;TT&#8208;PhO), has been carried out. A combination of UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR and infrared spectroelectrochemical techniques and cryogenic UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR absorption spectroscopy supported by theoretical calculations has been used. The main result is the formation of similar H&#8208;aggregates in the dimerization process of the neutral molecules and of the charged anionic species. The experimental absorption spectra of the aggregated species are accurately reproduced by quantum chemical calculations using the Spano's model, including excitonic coupling for the dimeric forms and full vibronic resolution of the absorption bands. The strong excitonic coupling taking place is key to understand the electronic structure of the dimeric species and has been instrumental to disentangle the type of H&#8208;aggregation. This study is of relevance to get a better understanding of the molecular aggregation of organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophores and is useful as a guideline for the refinement of the engineering of molecular materials for which supramolecular design is required.

         <title>Tuning The Intracellular Distribution of [3+2+1] Iridium(III) Complexes In Bacterial And Mammalian Cells By iClick Reaction With Biomolecular Carriers Functionalized With Alkynone Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;The colour and intracellular distribution of iridium(III) complexes is tuned by iClick conjugation of different biomolecular carriers&#8221;. The iClick (inorganic click) reaction enables a modular modification of iridium(III) complexes with ancillary triazolato ligands carrying biological targeting groups like biotin and cholic acid. The stability and non&#8208;toxicity of these compounds facilitates their use as biological imaging probes in bacterial and human cancer cells. Their intracellular localization can be tuned by proper peripheral functionalization of the complexes.







Abstract
Three iridium(III) triazolato complexes of the general formula [Ir(triazolatoR,R&#8217;)(ppy)(terpy)]PF6 with ppy=2&#8208;phenylpyridine and terpy=2,2&#8217;:6&#8217;,2&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;terpyridine were efficiently prepared by iClick reaction of [Ir(N3)(ppy)(terpy)]PF6, with alkynes and alkynones, which allowed facile introduction of biological carriers such as biotin and cholic acid. In contrast to the precursor azido complex, which decomposed upon photoexcitation on a very short time scale, the triazolato complexes were stable in solution for up to 48&#8197;h. They emit in the spectral region around 540&#8197;nm with a quantum yield of 15&#8211;35&#8201;% in aerated acetonitrile solution and exhibit low cytotoxicity with IC50 values &gt;50&#8197;&#956;M for most complexes in L929 and HeLa cells, demonstrating their high suitability as luminescent probes. Cell uptake studies with confocal luminescence microscopy in prokaryotic Gram&#8208;positive S. aureus and Gram&#8208;negative E. coli bacteria as well as eukaryotic mammalian L929 and HeLa cells showed significant uptake in particular of the cholic acid conjugates iridium(III) moiety and distinct intracellular distribution modulated by the nature of the peripheral functional groups that can easily be modified by the iClick reaction.

         <title>Skeletal Editing by Hypervalent Iodine Mediated Nitrogen Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iodonitrene (ArI=NR) is a highly reactive species that is commonly employed in a single&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;atom insertion reaction and skeletal editing for generating N&#8208;heterocycles. Skeletal editing with reactive iodonitrene intermediates has recently emerged as a powerful strategy in modern synthesis. In this review, we address the rapidly expanding field of nitrene insertion, which includes skeletal editing and nitrogen insertion, the use of hypervalent iodine compounds to access nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, and our present understanding of the process.







Abstract
Hypervalent iodine reagents are versatile and readily accessible reagents that have been extensively applied in contemporary synthesis in modern organic chemistry. Among them, iodonitrene (ArI=NR), is a powerful reactive species, widely used for a single&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;atom insertion reaction, and skeletal editing to construct N&#8208;heterocycles. Skeletal editing with reactive iodonitrene components has recently emerged as an exciting approach in modern chemical transformation. These reagents have been extensively used to produce biologically relevant heterocycles and functionalized molecular architectures. Recently, the insertion of a nitrogen&#8208;atom into hydrocarbons to generate N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds using hypervalent iodine reagents has been a significant focus in the field of molecular editing reactions. In this review, we discuss the rapidly emerging field of nitrene insertion, including skeletal editing and nitrogen insertion, using hypervalent iodine reagents to access nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, and the current mechanistic understanding of these processes.

In this review, we address the rapidly expanding field of nitrene insertion, which includes skeletal editing and nitrogen insertion, the use of hypervalent iodine compounds to access nitrogen-containing heterocycles, and our present understanding of the process.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypervalent iodine reagents are versatile and readily accessible reagents that have been extensively applied in contemporary synthesis in modern organic chemistry. Among them, iodonitrene (ArI=NR), is a powerful reactive species, widely used for a single-nitrogen-atom insertion reaction, and skeletal editing to construct N-heterocycles. Skeletal editing with reactive iodonitrene components has recently emerged as an exciting approach in modern chemical transformation. These reagents have been extensively used to produce biologically relevant heterocycles and functionalized molecular architectures. Recently, the insertion of a nitrogen-atom into hydrocarbons to generate &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic compounds using hypervalent iodine reagents has been a significant focus in the field of molecular editing reactions. In this review, we discuss the rapidly emerging field of nitrene insertion, including skeletal editing and nitrogen insertion, using hypervalent iodine reagents to access nitrogen-containing heterocycles, and the current mechanistic understanding of these processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Suppressing Protodeboronation in Cu&#8208;Mediated 19F/18F&#8208;Fluorination of Arylboronic Acids: A Mechanistically Guided Approach Towards Optimized PET Probe Development</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method was rationally optimized to minimize deleterious protodeboronation side&#8208;product in Cu&#8208;mediated 19F&#8208; and 18F&#8208;fluorination of arylboronic acids. Fluoride anion is activated through a hydrogen bond donor (HBD) effect under ligandless conditions featuring a new copper salt, Cu(ONf)2. This mild protocol occurs at lower temperature and demonstrates improved generality with good yields and radiochemical conversions and minimal protodeboronation.







Abstract
Fluorinated arenes play a crucial role in drug discovery, specialty materials, and medical imaging. Although several variants for Cu&#8208;mediated nucleophilic fluorination of arylboronic acids and derivatives have been developed, these protocols rarely address the occurrence and control of protodeboronation, which greatly complicates product separation and can compromise the effectiveness of a radiotracer for in&#8197;vivo imaging. Consequently, simpler and more efficient procedures are needed to allow rapid 18F/19F&#8208;fluorination of both arylboronic acids and esters while minimizing protodeboronation. Mechanistic controls revealed that in addition to a high temperature, strong donor ligands such as acetonitrile and pyridine accentuate a Cu&#8208;mediated protodeboronation. This observation guided the optimization of a ligandless procedure, with t&#8208;BuOH as solvent, to activate fluoride under milder conditions at lower temperatures minimizing protodeboronation. Additionally, a new copper salt, Cu(ONf)2 was employed to further improve the fluorination efficiency. A large range of functional groups are tolerated under the new procedure, which is complete within 30&#8197;minutes at a temperature of 60&#8201;&#176;C, and affords fluorinated arenes and heteroarenes in 39&#8201;% to 84&#8201;% yield. With minimal modifications, the protocol can also be applied in 18F&#8208;radiofluorination, affording radiochemical conversions (RCCs) between 17 and 54&#8201;% with minimal protodeboronation compared to previously established protocols.

         <title>Phosphorous and Nitrogen Dual&#8208;Doped Carbon as a Highly Efficient Electrocatalyst for Sodium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The P, N co&#8208;doped carbon has been used as cathode materials in Na&#8208;O2 batteries. The high battery performance is ascribed to the high adsorption energy toward NaO2 of this advanced cathode materials. The high adsorption energy of NaO2 can prevent NaO2 from decomposing into hard&#8208;to&#8208;decompose Na2O2 during discharging and thus increase the battery efficiency during the cycles.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;oxygen batteries have been regarded as promising energy storage devices due to their low overpotential and high energy density. Its applications, however, still face formidable challenges due to the lack of understanding about the influence of electrocatalysts on the discharge products. Here, a phosphorous and nitrogen dual&#8208;doped carbon (PNDC) based cathode is synthesized to increase the electrocatalytic activity and to stabilize the NaO2 superoxide nanoparticle discharge products, leading to enhanced cycling stability when compared to the nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NDC). The PNDC air cathode exhibits a low overpotential (0.36&#8197;V) and long cycling stability (120 cycles). The reversible formation/decomposition and stabilization of the NaO2 discharge products are clearly proven by in&#8208;situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction. Based on the density functional theory calculation, the PNDC has much stronger adsorption (&#8722;2.85&#8197;eV) for NaO2 than that of NDC (&#8722;1.80&#8197;eV), which could efficiently stabilize the NaO2 discharge products.

         <title>Exohedral Diels&#8208;Alder Reactivity of Endohedral Metallofullerene C36</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preferential position of 3d metal atoms inside the C36 cage and their effect on exohedral Diels&#8208;Alder reactivity is reported in comparison with the empty C360 and C362&#8722; cages. Among all [5&#8208;5], [6&#8208;5] and [6 6] C&#8722;C bonds the [5&#8208;5] bond is the most reactive bond in both the empty C36 and metallofullerene M@C36.







Abstract
Understanding the exohedral reactivity of metallofullerenes is crucial for its application in various fields. By systematically controlling the trapped species inside the fullerene its reactivity can be tamed. In this work we report the preferential position of 3d metal atoms inside the C36 cage and their effect on exohedral reactivity in comparison with the neutral and the dianionic cage. The Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reaction between butadiene and all non&#8208;equivalent [5&#8208;5], [6&#8208;5] and [6&#8208;6] C&#8722;C bonds on the fullerene cage was considered for the analysis, by using density functional theory at the S12g/TZ2P level including COSMO solvation model to elucidate the complete mechanistic pathways. Our results indicate that the preferential position of the metal ion is at the position close to the upper hexagon, and that the general trend in the reactivity of bonds follows the order [5&#8208;5]&gt;[6&#8208;5]&gt;[6&#8208;6]. Moreover, the encapsulation of metal atoms further enhances the reactivity of these bonds, by lowering the LUMOs of the cage, hence maximizing the orbital interactions.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reviews the topic of the Computer Aided Synthesis Project (CASP) and gives a detailed overview of the methods of machine learning to predict chemical reaction conditions, including the problem of data and descriptor selection, the indicators for the evaluation of results and the current research progress of various algorithms. The future research trends and possible challenges in chemical condition prediction are prospected.







Abstract
Computer&#8208;aided synthesis planning (CASP) has garnered increasing attention in light of recent advancements in machine learning models. While the focus is on reverse synthesis or forward outcome prediction, optimizing reaction conditions remains a significant challenge. For datasets with multiple variables, the choice of descriptors and models is pivotal. This selection dictates the effective extraction of conditional features and the achievement of higher prediction accuracy. This review delineates the origins of data in conditional optimization, the criteria for descriptor selection, the response models, and the metrics for outcome evaluation, aiming to acquaint readers with the latest research trends and facilitate more informed research in this domain.

         <title>Advancing Optoglycomics: Two Orthogonal Azobenzene Glycoside Antennas in One Glycocluster&#8211;Synthesis, Switching Cycles, Kinetics and Molecular Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new tool for the glycosciences: A heterobivalent glycocluster combines two photoswitchable azobenzene glycoside antennas with different photochromic properties. Hence, wavelength&#8208;selective E/Z isomerization of the glycoantennas is enabled and a switching cycle comprising three major isomers (EE, EZ, ZZ). Kinetic analysis explains the relaxation mechanism and MD simulations illustrate the relationship between isomeric state and distance between the sugar ligands.







Abstract
Carbohydrate recognition is essential for numerous biological processes and is governed by various factors within the supramolecular environment of the cell. Photoswitchable glycoconjugates have proven as valuable tools for the investigation and modulation of carbohydrate recognition as they allow to control the relative orientation of sugar ligands by light. In order to advance the possibilities of such an &#8220;optoglycomics&#8221; approach for the glycosciences, we have synthesized a biantennary glycocluster in which two glycoazobenzene antennas are conjugated to the 3&#8208; and 6&#8208;position of a scaffold glycoside. Orthogonal isomerization of the photoswitchable units was made possible by the different conjugation of the azobenzene moieties via an oxygen and a sulfur atom, respectively, and the ortho&#8208;fluorination of one of the azobenzene units. This design enabled a switching cycle comprising the EE, EZ and the ZZ isomer. This is the first example of an orthogonally photoswitchable glycocluster. The full analysis of its photochromic properties included the investigation of the isolated glycoazobenzene antennas allowing the comparison of the intra&#8208; versus the intermolecular orthogonal photoswitching. The kinetics of the thermal relaxation were analyzed in detail. A molecular dynamics study shows that indeed, the relative orientation of the glycoantennas and the distances between the terminal sugar ligands significantly vary depending on the isomeric state, as intended.

&lt;p&gt;A new tool for the glycosciences: A heterobivalent glycocluster combines two photoswitchable azobenzene glycoside antennas with different photochromic properties. Hence, wavelength-selective &lt;i&gt;E/Z&lt;/i&gt; isomerization of the glycoantennas is enabled and a switching cycle comprising three major isomers (&lt;i&gt;EE&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;EZ&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ZZ&lt;/i&gt;). Kinetic analysis explains the relaxation mechanism and MD simulations illustrate the relationship between isomeric state and distance between the sugar ligands.

         <title>Synthesis of Ce(IV) Heteroleptic Double&#8208;Decker Complex with a New Helical Naphthalocyanine as a Potential Gearing Subunit</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gearing up double&#8208;decker complexes. A prototype of a molecular gear has been synthesized in 12 steps, using a helical naphthalocyanine ligand as rotating cogwheels and a thioether octa&#8208;functionalized phthalocyanine as anchoring stator.







Abstract
This paper describes the synthesis of a cerium(IV)&#8208;based molecular gear composed of a thioether functionalized phthalocyanine anchoring ligand, and a helical naphthalocyanine rotating cogwheel functionalized with four carbazoles. The naphthalocyanine ligand 9 was obtained after eleven steps (overall yield of 0.2&#8201;%) as a mixture of three geometrical isomers, two of which are chiral and exhibit high levels of steric hindrance, as shown by DFT calculations. Their attributions have been made using 1H&#8208;NMR based on their different symmetry groups. The ratio of isomers was also determined and the prochiral C4h naphthalocyanine shown to be the major compound (55&#8201;%). Its heteroleptic complexation with cerium (IV) and the anchoring phthalocyanine ligand 10 gave the targeted molecular gear in a 16&#8201;% yield.

         <title>Green Synthesis of the Triazine Derivatives and their Application for the Benign Electrocatalytic Reaction of Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The paper studies the process of eco&#8208;friendly microwave assisted synthesis of a material based on triazine compounds and the possibility of its use as part of a hybrid catalyst for the electrochemical synthesis of ammonia under mild conditions by the NO3RR reaction.







Abstract
This work uses green sustainable reactions twice. Firstly, it is microwave synthesis: 2,4,6&#8208;tribiphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and similar compounds were prepared in a closed microwave reactor in n&#8208;octane by the Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction. Second, a hybrid electrocatalyst for the highly demanded electrochemical reaction of nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3RR) was prepared based on this material. This reaction has great potential to replace the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8208;Bosch process, and in addition, has independent value for the elimination of nitrate contamination of water resources. As shown in the work, microwave synthesis is an eco&#8208;friendly method for the synthesis of complex organic compounds; fast, selective and with a high yield of the target product. The electrocatalyst deposited on the graphite electrode consisted of a layer of 2,4&#8208;bis([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and related compounds coated with cobalt oxide. The hybrid catalyst was firmly retained on the graphite electrode during NO3RR and the material showed impressive stability with almost no decrease in catalytic activity even after the fifth cycle. Both 2,4&#8208;bis([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and the catalyst based on this substance were characterized by SEM, XPS, XRD, UV&#8208;vis spectra, cyclic (and linear) voltammetry, and chronoamperometry. This work can serve as a starting point for the development of stable and durable electrocatalysts for NO3RR using triazine derivatives.

         <title>The Effect of Reactive Oxygen Species on Respiratory Complex I Activity in Liposomes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Respiratory complex I (R&#8208;CI) is a major contributor to reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria. By reconstituting R&#8208;CI into artificial membrane vesicles and in conjunction with EPR spectroscopy, the effects of ROS are investigated. The activity of R&#8208;CI is reduced because of ROS, not only by damaging the enzyme but also by making the membrane more polar and protic.







Abstract
Respiratory complex I (R&#8208;CI) is an essential enzyme in the mitochondrial electron transport chain but also a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and ageing. While the mechanism of ROS production by R&#8208;CI is well&#8208;established, the feedback of ROS on R&#8208;CI activity is poorly understood. Here, we perform EPR spectroscopy on R&#8208;CI incorporated in artificial membrane vesicles to reveal that ROS (particularly hydroxyl radicals) reduce R&#8208;CI activity by making the membrane more polar and by increasing its hydrogen bonding capability. Moreover, the mechanism that we have uncovered reveals that the feedback of ROS on R&#8208;CI activity via the membrane is transient and not permanent; lipid peroxidation is negligible for the levels of ROS generated under these conditions. Our successful use of modular proteoliposome systems in conjunction with EPR spectroscopy and other biophysical techniques is a powerful approach for investigating ROS effects on other membrane proteins.

         <title>Stacking Transformation&#8208;Triggered Circularly Polarized Luminescence Reversion in &#947;&#8208;Cyclodextrins&#8208;Pyrene Co&#8208;Assembly</title>

         <dc:description>
CPL signal direction of cyclodextrins&#8208;pyrene co&#8208;assembly can be regulated through host&#8208;guest interaction&#8208;induced stacking transformation, demonstrating that (+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;CPL of pyrene&#8208;pyrene excimer is originated from right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed stacking conformation in &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrins, respectively.







Abstract
Considerable attention has been directed towards cyclodextrins (CDs) in the creation of co&#8208;assembled CPL&#8208;active materials, owing to their intrinsic chiral host cavities and synergistic host&#8208;guest interactions. However, achieving reversed CPL emission regulation with single&#8208;handedness CDs moiety poses a significant challenge. In this study, we have devised a series of &#947;&#8208;CD&#8208;based host&#8208;guest complexes comprising dual pyrene imidazolium derivatives with multiple linkers, which exhibit reversed circularly polarized emission. We have uncovered that the transformation of excimer stacking within &#947;&#8208;CD/pyrene complexes contributes to the inverted CPL emissions originating from a single&#8208;handed chiral host. This research elucidates the phenomenon of (+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;circularly polarized excimer emission (CPEE) within &#947;&#8208;CD, arising from right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed stacking conformations, respectively.

         <title>Switchable Deep Eutectic Solvents for Sustainable Sulfonamide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable and scalable synthesis of sulfonamides, from amines and sulfonyl chlorides, is achieved under aerobic conditions, at ambient temperature, in reusable choline chloride&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents. The interplay of electronic effects and the solubility characteristics of the starting materials in the selected DESs drives the sulfonamide synthesis over the hydrolysis of sulfonyl chlorides.







Abstract
A sustainable and scalable protocol for synthesizing variously functionalized sulfonamides, from amines and sulfonyl chlorides, has been developed using environmentally responsible and reusable choline chloride (ChCl)&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents (DESs). In ChCl/glycerol (1&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;mol&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and ChCl/urea (1&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;mol&#8201;mol&#8722;1), these reactions yield up to 97&#8201;% under aerobic conditions at ambient temperature within 2&#8211;12&#8197;h. The practicality of the method is exemplified by the sustainable synthesis of an FFA4 agonist and a key building block en route to anti&#8208;Alzheimer drug BMS&#8208;299897. A subtle interplay of electronic effects and the solubility characteristics of the starting materials in the aforementioned DESs seem to be responsible for driving the reaction successfully over the hydrolysis of sulfonyl chlorides. The procedure's eco&#8208;friendliness is validated by quantitative metrics like the E&#8208;factor and the EcoScale, with products isolated by extraction or filtration after decantation.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Benzene Valence Isomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Valence isomers of benzene have long attracted both synthetic and theoretical chemists due to their unique bonding and chemical reactivity. What new chemistry can be unlocked by introducing isosteric boron and nitrogen atoms in these structures? This concept paper highlights the recent development of boron(B)&#8208;nitrogen(N)&#8208;containing benzene valence isomers, specifically, BN&#8208;Dewar benzene and BN&#8208;benzvalene.







Abstract
Benzene is one of the most ubiquitous structural motifs in chemistry. The valence isomers of benzene have also attracted synthetic chemists&#8217; attention due to their unique structures, bonding, and reactivity. We have been investigating boron&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;containing benzene valence isomers via photoisomerization of 1,2&#8208;azaborines. In this contribution, we summarize recent developments of these highly strained BN&#8208;heterocyclic compounds including their synthesis, characterization, proposed mechanism of formation, and their potential applications.

         <title>Sequential&#8208;Flow Synthesis of Donepezil: A Green and Sustainable Strategy Featuring Heterogeneous Catalysis and Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atom&#8208;economical, sequential, and continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of donepezil was developed using inexpensive precursors. Key elements included highly functional heterogeneous catalytic processes for condensation and hydrogenation, with water as the sole byproduct. Additionally, in&#8208;line treatments eliminated inhibitory factors, enabling seamless integration of the multi&#8208;step continuous&#8208;flow reactions.







Abstract
An atom&#8208;economical sequential&#8208;flow synthesis of donepezil, a widely prescribed drug for Alzheimer's disease, was accomplished using inexpensive, commercially available precursors. This achievement was made possible by reconfiguring the synthetic route to include only heterogeneous catalytic addition and condensation reactions, with a particular emphasis on skeletal transformation and bond formation through hydrogenation processes. Notably, water was the sole byproduct in this synthesis. A crucial aspect of this work was the development of appropriate continuous&#8208;flow processes to achieve a one&#8208;flow synthesis. This was accomplished by implementing in&#8208;line treatments of the main reaction stream to eliminate inhibitory factors that could affect catalyst performance in the hydrogenation steps.

         <dc:description>Starting from a historical background that acknowledges isonitriles as a neglected class of compounds due to their unpleasant smell and hardly controlled reaction conditions with open shell species, the present concept article aims at highlighting the seeds of the modern isonitrile photochemistry. Representative essential transformations achieved via either UV light irradiation or radical initiators at high temperatures are brought into play to draw a parallel with the current literature relying on the exploitation of visible light photochemical methods. Such a comparison points out the potential of this enabling technology to further expand the scope of isonitrile chemistry and the unmet challenges which makes it a very stimulating field.</dc:description>

         <title>Melanin and Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Melanin is responsible, in Nature, for photoprotection, for this reason it is expected to be poorly photoreactive. However, the photo&#8208;reactivity of melanin and related materials is well documented. Here we discuss some relevant recent examples to demonstrate that, indeed, the actual mechanism of interaction of melanin with light is complex and still not completely understood. Photochemical and photothermal processes are involved, giving a contribution that strongly depends on light wavelength and intensity. Moreover, some interesting experiments demonstrated that photochemical reactivity of melanin related compounds is likely to be indirect, in the sense that the effect of light is to increase the number of radical species rather than creating photoreactive excited state. These suggestions open&#8208;up new perspectives in the interpretation of the role of melanin in photoprotection and in the design of new melanin based photoactive materials for energy conversion, environmental remediation, and nanomedicine. Further complication is given by the role of atmospheric oxygen and humidity in the photoinduced processes. Beside this complexity of behavior makes it difficult a systematic understanding of the interaction of melanin with light, it surely strongly contributes to make the properties of melanin and related materials unique.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Deconstructive Methoxylation of Arylalcohols &#8211; A Synthetic and Mechanistic Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a mechanistic investigation of a recently developed electrochemical method for the deconstructive methoxylation of arylalcohols. A combination of synthetic, electroanalytical, and computational experiments have been performed to gain a deeper understanding of the reaction mechanism and the structural requirements for fragmentation to occur. It was found that 2&#8208;arylalcohols undergo anodic oxidation to form the corresponding aromatic radical cations, which fragment to form oxocarbenium ions and benzylic radical intermediates via mesolytic cleavage, with further anodic oxidation and trapping of the benzylic carbocation with methanol to generate the observed methyl ether products. It was also found that the electrochemical fragmentation of 2&#8208;arylalkanols is promoted by structural features that stabilize the oxocarbenium ions and/or benzylic radical intermediates formed upon mesolytic cleavage of the aromatic radical cations. With an enhanced understanding of the reaction mechanism and the structural features that promote fragmentation, it is anticipated that alternative electrosynthetic transformations will be developed that utilize this powerful, yet underdeveloped, mode of substrate activation.</dc:description>

With an enhanced understanding of the reaction mechanism and the structural features that promote fragmentation, it is anticipated that alternative electrosynthetic transformations will be developed that utilize this powerful, yet underdeveloped, mode of substrate activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) via C&#8211;H activation constitutes an efficient method for the synthesis of isotopically&#8208;enriched compounds, which are crucial components of the drug discovery process and are extensively employed in mechanistic studies. A series of iridium(I) complexes, bearing a chelating phosphine&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand, was designed and synthesized for application in the catalytic HIE of challenging N&#8208; and O&#8208;aryl carbamates. A broad range of substrates were labeled efficiently, and applicability to biologically&#8208;relevant systems was demonstrated by labeling an &#671;&#8208;tyrosine&#8208;derived carbamate with excellent levels of deuterium incorporation. Combined theoretical and experimental studies unveiled intriguing mechanistic features within this process, in comparison to C&#8211;H activation and hydrogen isotope exchange catalysed by monodentate Ir(I) NHC/phosphine complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>The Conformational Behaviour of Fluorinated Tetrahydrothiopyran</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic interactions played a significant role in stabilizing the axial fluorine orientation of fluorinated tetrahydrothiopyran, occasionally supported by stereoelectronic interactions. These combined forces were observed to stabilize less polar conformers of fluorinated tetrahydrothiopyrans even in polar solutions. Both experimental and computational investigations were thoroughly conducted on a variety of fluorinated tetrahydrothiopyran derivatives.







Abstract
We present a comprehensive study on the conformational behavior of diversely substituted 4&#8208;fluorotetrahydrothiopyran derivatives. Through quantum chemical simulations including DFT as well as NBO and NPA analysis, we elucidate the pivotal role of electrostatic interactions, occasionally complemented by hyperconjugative interactions, in stabilizing axial fluorine conformers. Less polar conformers were occasionally obtained, attributed to the interplay of electrostatic and hyperconjugative interactions. Experimental validation through NMR spectroscopy aligns with the computational analysis, thus providing a coherent understanding of the structural dynamics of these compounds.

         <title>Chiral Sulfoximine Mediated Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Atropselective C&#8722;H Annulation of Ynamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cp*Co(III)&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective annulation of arenes with ynamides has led to the synthesis of axially chiral five&#8208;membered 2&#8208;amidoindenones. The chiral sulfoximine directing group plays crucial; the sulfoximine moiety is cleaved and reused. DFT studies shed insights in understanding the origin of asymmetric induction.







Abstract
An achiral Cp*Co(III)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H activation/annulation of chiral sulfoximine&#8208;enabled thioamides with ynamides is presented herein. This method successfully synthesizes axially chiral five&#8208;membered 2&#8208;amidoindenones with good enantiocontrol. Interestingly, the annulation with chiral oxazolidone&#8208;containing ynamides could provide a separable mixture of diastereomers (up to ~10&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). Moreover, enantiopure sulfoximines could be recovered with ~99&#8201;% purity, making this method practical. DFT studies show valuable insight into the mechanism and origin of asymmetric induction.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Stepwise Double Dehydrogenation for the Formation of a para&#8208;Quinodimethane&#8208;Containing Undecacene Isomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of an undecacene isomer with unique structural features, including two cyclobutadiene and two para&#8208;quinodimethane (p&#8208;QDM) moieties within the 1D polycyclic system, was achieved via a novel on&#8208;surface dehydrogenation reaction induced by voltage pulses. This work broadens the arsenal of on&#8208;surface synthesis methods and provides new insights into modifying the electronic properties of acene analogs through the incorporation of nonbenzenoid rings.







Abstract
The on&#8208;surface synthesis of an isomer of undecacene, bearing two four&#8208;membered rings and two para&#8208;quinodimethane moieties, starting from a tetramethyl&#8208;substituted diepoxy precursor, is presented. The transformation implies a thermal double deoxygenation followed by a stepwise double dehydrogenation reaction on the Au(111) surface, locally induced by inelastic tunneling electrons. This results in the transformation of para&#8208;dimethylbenzene moieties into non&#8208;aromatic para&#8208;quinodimethanes. The structures and electronic properties of the intermediate and final products are investigated at the single molecule level with high spatial resolution, using both scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy. The experimental results are supported by density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of High Performance Energetic Biocidal Bicyclic Compounds Derivated from Iodopyrazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modular synthesis for energetic biocidal materials was represented. Iodopyrazole precursors 1&#8211;2 were synthesized for the first time as biocidal modules, and then C&#8722;N coupling reactions were carried out with two energetic modules respectively to obtain bicyclic molecules 3&#8211;6 in one&#8208;step facile method. 5 and 6 exhibited highest gas production (V) of 212.85&#8197;L&#8201;mol&#8722;1, 217.66&#8197;L&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively so far.







Abstract
Modular synthesis can combine different functional modules to flexibly regulate comprehensive properties and study the diversity of compounds. This study established a modular bicyclic synthesis strategy of combining polynitro energetic module with iodine&#8208;containing biocidal module. Compounds 1&#8211;6 with high iodine content (48.72&#8211;69.56&#8201;%) and high thermal stability (Td: 172&#8211;304&#8201;&#176;C) were synthesized and exhaustively identified. By modular synthesis, the detonation properties and gas&#8208;production of 3&#8211;6 improved greatly expanding their biocidal efficacy and maintained the iodine atomic utilization of iodine&#8208;containing module. Notably, 4,5&#8208;diiodo&#8208;3,4&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;trinitro&#8208;1,3&#8217;&#8208;bipyrazole (5) and 3,5&#8208;diiodo&#8208;4,4&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;trinitro&#8208;1,3&#8217;&#8208;bipyrazole (6) exhibit high detonation velocities (D: 5903&#8197;m&#8201;s&#8722;1, 5769&#8197;m&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively) and highest gas production of 212.85&#8197;L&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and 217.66&#8197;L&#8201;mol&#8722;1 after decomposition. This study diversifies polyiodio&#8208;nitro compounds, and also inspire the implementation of similar synthesis strategies to provide family&#8208;level synthetic solutions to energetic biocidal materials.

         <title>Insight from Electrochemical Analysis in the Radical Cation State of a Monopyrrolotetrathiafulvalene&#8208;Based [2]Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical studies on a bistable [2]rotaxane incorporating a monopyrrolotetrathiafulvalene (MPTTF) unit (green) and an oxyphenylene (OP) moiety (red) in the dumbbell component and encircled by the cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene) (CBPQT4+) ring (blue) was used to profile the energy landscapes when the CBPQT4+ ring moves across the MPTTF unit in all of its three accessible redox states (0, +1, and +2).







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules are a class of compounds used for controlling directional movement when barriers can be raised and lowered using external stimuli. Applied voltages can turn on redox states to alter electrostatic barriers but their use for directing motion requires knowledge of their impact on the kinetics. Herein, we make the first measurements on the movement of cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene) (CBPQT4+) across the radical&#8208;cation state of monopyrrolotetrathiafulvalene (MPTTF) in a [2]rotaxane using variable scan&#8208;rate electrochemistry. The [2]rotaxane is designed in a way that directs CBPQT4+ to a high&#8208;energy co&#8208;conformation upon oxidation of MPTTF to either the radical cation (MPTTF&#8901;+) or the dication (MPTTF2+). 1H&#160;NMR spectroscopic investigations carried out in acetonitrile at 298&#8197;K showed direct interconversion to the thermodynamically more stable ground&#8208;state co&#8208;conformation with CBPQT4+ moving across the oxidized MPTTF2+ electrostatic barrier. The electrochemical studies revealed that interconversion takes place by movement of CBPQT4+ across both the MPTTF&#8226;+ (19.3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and MPTTF2+ (18.7&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) barriers. The outcome of our studies shows that MPTTF has three accessible redox states that can be used to kinetically control the movement of the ring component in mechanically interlocked molecules.

         <title>Benzoic Acid Serves as Precursor of Catalytic HAT Reagent in a Two&#8208;Molecule Photoredox System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl carboxy radicals generated from benzoic acids in a two&#8208;molecule photoredox system can function as catalytic HAT reagents. Various acetals, ethers, alcohols, and alkenes can be employed in the photoreaction to provide both high yields of adducts and high recoveries of benzoic acids.







Abstract
The photoinduced regioselective HAT reactions of acetals, ethers, and alcohols using benzoic acids in a two&#8208;molecule photoredox system led to the formation of new C&#8722;C bonds with alkenes under mild conditions. Aryl carboxy radicals generated from benzoic acids in a two&#8208;molecule photoredox system can function as catalytic HAT reagents, even though an excess amount of a hydrogen donor substrate is required. Various acetals, ethers, alcohols, and alkenes can be employed in the photoreaction to provide both high yields of adducts and high recoveries of benzoic acids.

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Molecule Hybridization at a Ferromagnetic Interface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using angle&#8208;resolved photoemission and density functional theory, we show that introducing graphene as a buffer layer between a molecular layer and a ferromagnetic substrate nearly isolates the molecule electronically, yet hybridization persists. In particular, FePc/Gr/Co and F16FePc/Gr/Co reveal a &#960; hybrid state due to vertical interaction between graphene's pz state and the molecular &#960; core.







Abstract
The introduction of a graphene (Gr) buffer layer between a ferromagnetic substrate and a metallorganic molecule is known to mediate the magnetic coupling between them, an effect attributed to a weak hybridization between graphene and molecule. In this paper, we present experimental evidence of this effect through a detailed investigation of the frontier electronic properties of iron phthalocyanine deposited on cobalt&#8208;supported graphene. Despite being physisorbed, the molecular adsorption on Gr/Co induces a sizeable charge transfer from graphene to the molecular macrocycle leading to the partial occupation of the LUMO and the appearance of an energetically localized hybrid state, which can be attributed to the overlap between the graphene pz state and the molecular macrocycle. Graphene is not inert either; the adsorption of the molecule induces doping and alters the Fermi velocity of both the hybrid minicone state and the Dirac cone. Similar effects are observed when the molecular periphery is decorated with fluorine atoms, known for their electron&#8208;withdrawing properties, with minimal changes in the energy alignment.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Protein Stabilization in VIVO/8&#8208;Hydroxyquinoline&#8211;Lysozyme Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction of potential drug [VIVO(8&#8208;HQ)2], with 8&#8208;HQ = 8&#8208;hydroxyquinolinato, with lysozyme results in the formation of a non&#8208;covalent adduct with [VIVO(8&#8208;HQ)2(H2O)] and covalent with [VIVO(8&#8208;HQ)(H2O)]+ upon the binding to Asp119. Covalent binding is favored by a &#960;&#8208;&#960; contact with Trp62 of another protein molecule, unveiling the role of protein&#8208;protein interaction in the stabilization of metal&#8208;protein adducts.







Abstract
The binding of the potential drug [VIVO(8&#8208;HQ)2], where 8&#8208;HQ is 8&#8208;hydroxyquinolinato, with hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) was evaluated through spectroscopic (electron paramagnetic resonance, EPR, and UV&#8208;visible), spectrometric (electrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometry, ESI&#8208;MS), crystallographic (X&#8208;ray diffraction, XRD), and computational (DFT and docking) studies. ESI&#8208;MS indicates the interaction of [VIVO(8&#8208;HQ)(H2O)]+ and [VIVO(8&#8208;HQ)2(H2O)] species with HEWL. Room temperature EPR spectra suggest both covalent and non&#8208;covalent binding of the two different V&#8208;containing fragments. XRD analyses confirm these findings, showing that [VIVO(8&#8208;HQ)(H2O)]+ interacts covalently with the solvent exposed Asp119, while cis&#8208;[VIVO(8&#8208;HQ)2(H2O)] non&#8208;covalently with Arg128 and Lys96 from a symmetry mate. The covalent binding of [VIVO(8&#8208;HQ)(H2O)]+ to Asp119 is favored by a &#960;&#8208;&#960; contact with Trp62 and a H&#8208;bond with Asn103 of a symmetry&#8208;related molecule. Additionally, the covalent binding of VVO2+ to Asp48 and non&#8208;covalent binding of other V&#8208;containing fragments to Arg5, Cys6, and Glu7 are revealed. Molecular docking indicates that, in the absence of the interactions occurring at the protein&#8208;protein interface close to Asp119, the covalent binding to Glu35 or Asp52 should be preferred. Such a protein&#8208;protein stabilization could be more common than what believed up today, at least in the solid state, and should be considered in the characterization of metal&#8208;protein adducts.

     alt="Protein-Protein Stabilization in VIVO/8-Hydroxyquinoline&#8211;Lysozyme Adducts"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interaction of potential drug [V&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;O(8-HQ)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], with 8-HQ = 8-hydroxyquinolinato, with lysozyme results in the formation of a non-covalent adduct with [V&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;O(8-HQ)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)] and covalent with [V&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;O(8-HQ)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; upon the binding to Asp119. Covalent binding is favored by a &#960;-&#960; contact with Trp62 of another protein molecule, unveiling the role of protein-protein interaction in the stabilization of metal-protein adducts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The binding of the potential drug [V&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;O(8-HQ)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], where 8-HQ is 8-hydroxyquinolinato, with hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) was evaluated through spectroscopic (electron paramagnetic resonance, EPR, and UV-visible), spectrometric (electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry, ESI-MS), crystallographic (X-ray diffraction, XRD), and computational (DFT and docking) studies. ESI-MS indicates the interaction of [V&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;O(8-HQ)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and [V&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;O(8-HQ)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)] species with HEWL. Room temperature EPR spectra suggest both covalent and non-covalent binding of the two different V-containing fragments. XRD analyses confirm these findings, showing that [V&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;O(8-HQ)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interacts covalently with the solvent exposed Asp119, while &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-[V&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;O(8-HQ)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)] non-covalently with Arg128 and Lys96 from a symmetry mate. The covalent binding of [V&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;O(8-HQ)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to Asp119 is favored by a &#960;-&#960; contact with Trp62 and a H-bond with Asn103 of a symmetry-related molecule. Additionally, the covalent binding of V&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to Asp48 and non-covalent binding of other V-containing fragments to Arg5, Cys6, and Glu7 are revealed. Molecular docking indicates that, in the absence of the interactions occurring at the protein-protein interface close to Asp119, the covalent binding to Glu35 or Asp52 should be preferred. Such a protein-protein stabilization could be more common than what believed up today, at least in the solid state, and should be considered in the characterization of metal-protein adducts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Triptycene&#8208;Based Tripodal Molecular Platforms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two universal triptycene&#8208;based tripodal pedestals featuring terminal alkynes in the axial position are presented. Their versatility is showcased by incorporating them into the structures of diverse functional molecules such as unidirectional light&#8208;driven molecular motors, photoswitches, and Brownian molecular rotors.







Abstract
Molecular platforms are essential components of various surface&#8208;mounted molecular devices. Here, we document the synthesis of two universal triptycene&#8208;based tripodal pedestals featuring terminal alkynes in the axial position. We showcase their versatility by incorporating them into the structures of diverse functional molecules such as unidirectional light&#8208;driven molecular motors, photoswitches, and Brownian molecular rotors using standard cross&#8208;coupling reactions. We also present their fundamental physical properties, including acidity constants, data from differential scanning calorimetry, and crystallographic analysis of two parent and five derived structures. Finally, and importantly, we demonstrate that the photochemical properties of selected photoswitch representatives remain uncompromised when fused with tripods.

         <title>Recent Applications of Sulfonium Salts in Synthesis and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of sulfonium salts in organic synthesis has experienced a dramatic increase during the last years that can arguably be attributed to three main factors; the development of more direct and efficient synthetic methods that make easily available sulfonium reagents of a wide structural variety, their intrinsic thermal stability, which facilitates their structural modification, handling and purification even on large scale, and the recognition that their reactivity resembles that of hypervalent iodine compounds and therefore, they can be used as replacement of such reagents for most of their uses. This renewed interest has led to the improvement of already existing reactions, as well as to the discovery of unprecedented transformations; in particular, by the implementation of photocatalytic protocols. This review aims to summarize the most recent advancements on the area focusing on the work published during and after 2020. The scope of the methods developed will be highlighted and their limitations critically evaluated.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigations of Crucial Factors for the Non&#8208;Covalent Functionalization of Black Phosphorus (BP) using Perylene Diimide Derivatives for the Passivation of BP Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The non&#8208;covalent functionalization of black phosphorus (BP) was studied with a scope of ten tailor&#8208;made perylene diimides (PDIs). A combination of UV/Vis&#8208;, fluorescence&#8208;, as well as Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy was used to investigate the structural factors, which contribute to a pronounced PDI&#8208;BP interaction and thus support the protection of BP nanosheets against oxidative degradation. We were able to show, that water&#8208;soluble, amphiphilic PDIs with highly charged head groups can be used for the non&#8208;covalent functionalization of BP in aqueous media. Here, based on the hydrophobic effect, an efficient adsorption of the respective PDI molecules takes place and leads to the formation of a passivating film, yielding a considerable stabilization of the BP flakes under ambient conditions exceeding 30 days.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Steric and Electronic Properties of Hemilabile NHC ligands for Gold(I/III) Catalyzed Oxyarylation of Ethylene: A Computational Study.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanistic studies on 1,2&#8208;oxyarylation of ethylene promoted by gold catalysts bearing hemilabile N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC^X) ligands were conducted by DFT calculations, exploring the whole catalytic cycle. After highest energy transition state (TS) barriers were located for NHC^N gold catalyst, and experimental results with different iodoarenes and alcohols rationalized, the study was extended to modified NHC^X catalysts, to observe how electronic and steric effects could affect the rate determining step TS. Electronic effects were investigated on NHC^X (X = H, N, O, P, and S), whereas steric effects emerged when comparing catalysts with different N&#8208;R groups (R = Dipp, Mes, tBu and Me). Finally, we suggest a different catalyst design based on N&#8208;aryl N&#8208;o&#8208;donor&#8208;aryl NHC, with different donors and NHC backbones to search for better performing systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational screening two&#8208;dimensional conjugated microporous polymer applied in perovskite solar cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A two&#8208;dimensional (2D) conjugated microporous polymer with a structure of 2D nanosheets has been synthesized. Theoretical calculations and experimental results reveal that the Fermi level of this 2D polymer aligns well with perovskite absorber, and its conduction band is high enough to block electron transport to the anode. This 2D polymer is used to modify the hole transport layer, significantly improving its photoelectric properties, including enhanced hole mobility, matched energy level, and reduced recombination. Furthermore, the 2D polymer exhibits a mesoporous structure, allowing perovskite to fill into its loose framework, increasing the hole export area and providing a large hole transport flux. As a result, the efficiency of inverted perovskite solar cells enhances to 24.64% from 21.17% of control device without 2D conjugated microporous polymer. Given that this material can be synthesized on a large scale, this work has significant implications for the future development of 2D polymers in perovskite solar cells, potentially accelerating industrialization.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Enantioselective Triplet Radical Reaction on Metal: Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Conjugate Addition of Acylsilanes to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketones and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photoinduced copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective conjugate addition of acylsilanes has been developed. The conjugate acylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones and aldehydes was promoted by a copper(I)/chiral NHC catalyst under visible&#8208;light irradiation for synthesizing various 2&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds in enantioenriched forms. Mechanistic studies combining experiments and quantum chemical calculations indicated a reaction mechanism involving copper&#8208;to&#8208;acyl charge transfer (i.e., metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT)) excitation of an alkene&#8208;bound acylcopper complex. The MLCT excitation is followed by an electronical and geometrical change to generate a &#946;&#8208;radical&#8208;C&#8208;enolate&#8208;Cu(II)&#8208;acyl complex with an acyl radical character, which undergoes facile C&#8211;C bond formation in the copper coordination sphere, affording the 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition product.</dc:description>

         <title>High Yield of L&#8208;Sorbose via D&#8208;Glucose Isomerization in Ethanol over a Bifunctional Titanium&#8208;Boron&#8208;Beta Zeolite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>D&#8208;Glucose&#8208;to&#8208;L&#8208;sorbose isomerization on Lewis acidic zeolite is a highly attractive avenue for sorbose production. But the L&#8208;sorbose yield is limited by the competing D&#8208;glucose&#8208;to&#8208;D&#8208;fructose isomerization and reaction equilibrium. In this work, it is suggested that ethanol directs the glucose conformation for selective D&#8208;glucose&#8208;to&#8208;L&#8208;sorbose isomerization. It also reacts with the produced L&#8208;sorbose to form ethyl&#8208;sorboside, which allows the D&#8208;glucose&#8208;to&#8208;L&#8208;sorbose isomerization to proceed beyond the thermodynamic equilibrium limit.&#160; It is shown that a bifunctional zeolite Beta containing framework titanium (Ti) and boron (B) is a selective catalyst for this tandem reaction: Lewis acidic framework Ti catalyzes the D&#8208;glucose&#8208;to&#8208;L&#8208;sorbose isomerization via an intramolecular 5,1&#8208;hydride shift process as confirmed by isotopic tracing experiments followed by 13C&#8208;NMR, while weak Br&#248;nsted acid framework B selectively promotes the sorbose ketalization with ethanol. A remarkably high yield of L&#8208;sorbose with a high fraction of sugar (&gt;95%: 27% unreacted glucose, 11.4% fructose, 57% sorbose) was obtained after the mixture produced in ethanol was hydrolyzed.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancement of Effective Energy Barrier and Magnetic Blocking Temperature in Tetraoxolene Radical Coupled Dinuclear Dysprosium Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A well&#8208;judged combination of a high axial ligand field and a bridging radical ligand in a dinuclear lanthanide complex provides a single&#8208;molecule magnet with a higher effective energy barrier for magnetic relaxation and blocking temperature compared to its non&#8208;radical analog due to significant magnetic exchange coupling between radical and Ln(III) ions. In this work, we report two chloranilate (CA) bridged dinuclear dysprosium complexes, [{(bbpen)Dy(&#956;2&#8208;CA)Dy(bbpen)}] (1Dy) and [{(bbpen)Dy(&#956;2&#8208;CA&#8226;)Dy(bbpen)}&#8208;{CoCp2}+] (2Dy), where 2Dy is the radical bridged Dy&#8208;complex obtained via the chemical reduction of bridging CA moiety (H2bbpen = N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;hydroxybenzyl)&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;methylpyridyl)ethylenediamine). The presence of high electronegative phenoxide moiety enhances the axial anisotropy of pseudo&#8208;square antiprismatic Dy(III) ions. The diffused spin of radical is efficiently coupled with anisotropic Dy(III) centres and decreases the quantum tunnelling of magnetization (QTM) in the magnetic relaxation process. The magnetic relaxation of 1Dy follows Orbach, Raman, and QTM processes whereas for 2Dy it follows Orbach and Raman Processes. Due to less involvement of the QTM relaxation process, 2Dy shows a higher thermal energy barrier (Ueff = 700 K) and a high blocking temperature (6.7 K), compared to its non&#8208;radical analog. Remarkably, the radical coupled 2Dy complex shows the highest energy barrier among the radical bridged Dy(III)&#8208;based SMMs to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimensionally Extending from 1D MX&#8208;Chain to Ladder and Nanotube Systems: Structural and Electronic properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular one&#8208;dimensional (1D) electron systems have attracted much attention due to their unique electronic state, physical and chemical properties derived from high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio structures. Among 1D materials, mixed&#8208;valence halogen&#8208;bridged transition&#8208;metal chain complexes (MX&#8208;chains) based on coordination assemblies are currently of particular interest because their electronic properties, such as mixed&#8208;valence state and band gap, can be controlled by substituting components and varying configurations. In particular, chemistry has recently noted that dimensionally extending MX&#8208;chains through organic rung ligands can introduce and modulate electronic coupling of metal atoms between chains, i.e., interchain interactions. In this review, for the first time, we highlight the recent progress on MX systems from the viewpoint of dimensionally extending from 1D chain to ladder and nanotube, mainly involving structural design and electronic properties. Overall, dimensional extension can not only tune the electronic properties of MX&#8208;chain, but also build the unique platform for studying transport dynamics in confined space, such as proton conduction. Based on these features, we envision that the MX&#8208;chain systems provide valuable insights into deep understanding of 1D electron systems, as well as the potential applications such as nanoelectronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Photostimulated Anticancer Activity of Mitochondria Localized Rhenium(I) Tricarbonyl Complexes Bearing 1H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;f][1,10]phenanthroline Ligands Against MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 Cancer Cells</title>

         <dc:description>We have introduced Re(I) tricarbonyl complexes (ReL1 &#8208; ReL6) [Re(CO)3(N^N)Cl] where N^N = extensive &#960; conjugated imidazo&#8208;[4,5&#8208;f]1,10&#8208;phenanthroline derivatives that helps in strong DNA intercalation, enhanced photophysical behavior, increase the 3&#960;&#8208;&#960;* character of T1 state for PDT and high value of lipophilicity for cell membrane penetration. These complexes exhibited prominent intraligand/ligand&#8208;centered (&#960; &#8208; &#960;*/ 1LC) absorption bands at &#955; 260 &#8208; 350 nm and relatively weak metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer (1MLCT) bands within the &#955; 350 &#8208; 550 nm range. Among the six synthesized complexes, [(CO)3ReICl(K2&#8208;N,N&#8208;2&#8208;(4&#8208;(1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;f][1,10]phenanthroline] (ReL6) exhibited outstanding potency (IC50 ~ 6 &#181;M, PI &gt; 9) under yellow light irradiation compared to dark conditions. Importantly, extremely lipophilic complex ReL6 showed effective penetration through the cell membrane and localized primarily in mitochondria (Pearson&#8217;s correlation coefficient, PCC = 0.918) of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells. Complex ReL6 exhibited more than 9 times higher photo&#8208;toxicity in normoxic and hypoxic environment of tumor by inducing 1O2 generation (type II PDT), radical generation triggered by NADH oxidation (type I PDT). This complex is a promising candidate for TNBC treatment in hypoxic tumors, with efficacy comparable to photofrin and have demonstrated CO release ability under UV light irradiation.</dc:description>

Among the six synthesized complexes, [(CO)3ReICl(K2-N,N-2-(4-(1-benzyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)phenyl)-1H-imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthroline] (ReL6) exhibited outstanding potency (IC50 ~ 6 &#181;M, PI &amp;gt; 9) under yellow light irradiation compared to dark conditions. Importantly, extremely lipophilic complex ReL6 showed effective penetration through the cell membrane and localized primarily in mitochondria (Pearson&#8217;s correlation coefficient, PCC = 0.918) of MDA-MB-231 cells. Complex ReL6 exhibited more than 9 times higher photo-toxicity in normoxic and hypoxic environment of tumor by inducing 1O2 generation (type II PDT), radical generation triggered by NADH oxidation (type I PDT). This complex is a promising candidate for TNBC treatment in hypoxic tumors, with efficacy comparable to photofrin and have demonstrated CO release ability under UV light irradiation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper&#8208;surface&#8208;mediated synthesis of sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated covalent organic framework photocathodes for photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sp2&#8208;carbon (sp2&#8208;c) covalent organic frameworks (COFs), featuring distinctive &#960;&#8208;conjugated network structures, facilitate the migration of photo&#8208;generated carriers, rendering them exceptionally appealing for applications in photoelectrochemical water splitting. However, owing to the powdery nature of COFs, leaving anchor the sp2&#8208;c COFs powder tightly onto a conductive substrate challenging. Here, we propose a method for preparing photoactive substance&#8208;conductive substrate integrated photocathodes through copper surface&#8208;mediated knoevenagel polycondensation (Cu&#8208;SMKP), this approach results in a uniform and stable sp2&#8208;c COF film, directly grown on commercial copper foam (COFTh&#8208;Cu). The COFTh&#8208;Cu demonstrates a high H2&#8208;evolution photocurrent density of 56 &#956;A cm&#8722;2 at 0.3 V versus RHE, sustaining stability for 12 hours. The as&#8208;prepared COFTh&#8208;Cu represents a 4.5&#8208;fold increase in current density compared to traditional spin&#8208;coating methods and outperforms most COF photocathodes without cocatalysts. This innovative copper surface&#8208;mediated approach for preparing photocathodes opens up a crucial pathway towards the realization of highly active COF photocathodes</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To tackle the global energy scarcity and environmental degradation, developing efficient electrocatalysts is essential for achieving sustainable hydrogen production via water splitting. Modulating the d&#8208;band center of transition metal electrocatalysts is an effective approach to regulate the adsorption energy of intermediates, alter reaction pathways, lower the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step, and ultimately improve electrocatalytic water splitting performance. In this review, a comprehensive overview of the recent advancements in modulating the d&#8208;band center for enhanced electrocatalytic water splitting is offered. Initially, the basics of the d&#8208;band theory are discussed. Subsequently, recent modulation strategies that aim to boost electrocatalytic activity, with particular emphasis on the d&#8208;band center as a key indicator in water splitting are summarized. Lastly, the importance of regulating electrocatalytic activity through d&#8208;band center, along with the challenges and prospects for improving electrocatalytic water splitting performance by fine&#8208;tuning the transition metal d&#8208;band center, are provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Encapsulation of Menthol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of flavoring ingredients like menthol in the food industry is hindered by their high volatility and poor thermal stability, which lead to significant losses during processing and storage. Encapsulation of flavors into porous materials to obtain inclusion complexes (ICs) has proved to be an efficient strategy. In the present study, we synthesized a series of relatively food&#8208;safe three&#8208;dimensional anionic cyclodextrin&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (CD&#8208;COFs) with spiroborate linkages using a facile microwave&#8208;assisted method. The high surface area and newly formed cavitied of COFs significantly enhanced the encapsulation efficiency of menthol compared to native CD materials. Our findings revealed that &#947;&#8208;CD&#8208;COF&#8208;Li, with Li+ as the counterion, achieved superior encapsulation efficiency of 25.9%, outperforming &#947;&#8208;CD&#8208;COF&#8208;Na, &#947;&#8208;CD&#8208;COF&#8208;K and &#945;&#8208;CD&#8208;COF&#8208;Li under the same conditions. Thermal stability measurements show that the menthol/&#947;&#8208;CD&#8208;COF&#8208;Li&#8208;ICs effectively stabilize menthol against heat evaporation at elevated temperatures due to the strengthened interaction between menthol and &#947;&#8208;CD&#8208;COF&#8208;Li. The promising results of this research suggest that rapid advancements in COF technology will provide new opportunities for enhancing the stability of flavoring ingredients in the food industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Photophysical Characterization of Biocompatible Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Carbazole&#8208;Coumarins for Sensing Applications.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of biocompatible fluorescent carbazole&#8208;coumarins with robust photoluminescence quantum yields and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties have been meticulously designed and synthesized. The TADF characteristics of these compounds were methodically investigated both in solution and in the solid state. Furthermore, the study showcased the promising practical applications of these compounds by integrating them into a Cmr&#8208;PMMA&#8208;based sensor for molecular oxygen detection.







Abstract
A series of fluorescent carbazole&#8208;coumarins exhibiting good photoluminescence quantum yields and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties have been designed and synthetized using computer&#8208;aided density functional theory calculations. The TADF characteristics of the carbazole&#8208;coumarins were systematically explored both in solution and in the solid state, utilizing poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as a matrix. The study revealed that the introduction of carbazole units onto the coumarin benzene ring led to compounds with thermally induced reverse intersystem crossing and delayed fluorescence. The study further demonstrated the potential utility of these compounds in practical applications by incorporating them into a Cmr&#8208;PMMA&#8208;based sensor for molecular oxygen detection. The resulting sensor exhibited promising performance, highlighting the adaptability and efficacy of the synthesized TADF&#8208;carbazole&#8208;coumarin compounds for reversible molecular oxygen sensing.

         <title>Theoretical Insight into Complexation Between Cyclocarbons and C60 Fullerene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binding energy between cyclocarbons and C60 fullerene is significantly stronger than that between two C18 or two C60 fullerenes. As the ring size increases, the angle between the cyclocarbons of the 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 trimers formed by two cyclocarbons and C60 fullerene gradually decreases. The research results on the 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 trimers formed by cyclocarbon and two C60 fullerenes showed when the cyclocarbon is not quite large, the trimers exhibit an ideal dumbbell&#8208;like structure.







Abstract
This work conducts a comprehensive theoretical study on the non&#8208;covalent complexation between cyclocarbons and C60 fullerene for the first time. The binding energy between cyclocarbons and C60 fullerene is significantly stronger than that between two C18 or two C60 fullerenes, indicating a particularly strong affinity. The cyclocarbons and C60 fullerene can spontaneously assemble into complexes in the gas phase at room temperature, and the hydrophobic effect caused by the solvent environment can promote this binding. The binding strength with C60 fullerene increases almost linearly with the increase of cyclocarbon size, and the C34@C60 dimer exhibits a perfect nano&#8208;Saturn structure. As the ring size increases, the angle between the two cyclocarbons of the 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 trimers formed by cyclocarbons and C60 fullerene gradually decreases. In C60@2&#8197;C34 trimer, the fullerene is symmetrically surrounded by two cyclocarbons. The results on the trimers formed by cyclocarbon and C60 fullerenes in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 ratio showed when the cyclocarbon sandwiched between two fullerenes is not quite large, the trimers exhibit an ideal dumbbell&#8208;like structure, and the presence of the first fullerene has a significant synergistic effect on the binding of the second one. The cyclocarbon greatly promotes the dimerization of fullerenes, which acted as a &#8220;molecular glue&#8221;.

         <title>Photocatalytic Sulfonylation: Innovations and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We summarized recent advances in photocatalytic sulfonylation utilizing sulfonyl chloride, sodium sulfinates, sulfonyl hydrazides, and sulfinic acids as sources of sulfonyl radicals. All the reaction designs and mechanisms have been comprehensively analyzed.







Abstract
Photosynthesis, converting sustainable solar energy into chemical energy, has emerged as a promising craft to achieve diverse organic transformations due to its mild reaction conditions, sustainability, and high efficiency. The synthesis of sulfonated compounds has drawn significant attention in the pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials industries due to the unique structure and electronic properties of the sulfonyl groups. Over the past decades, many photocatalytic sulfonylation reactions have been developed. In this review, the recent advances in photocatalyzed sulfonylation have been reviewed since 2020, with a primary focus on discussing reaction design and mechanism.

         <title>Superior Tumor Cell Uptake by Mono&#8208; and Tri&#8208;Nuclear Rhodamine&#8208;Gadolinium(III) Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superior cell uptake and tumor cell selectivity at low incubation concentrations by new mono&#8208; and tri&#8208;nuclear rhodamine&#8208;gadolinium(III) agents are reported, offering potential dual MRI/fluorescent probes for advanced theranostic applications.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of a novel trinuclear rhodamine&#8208;Gd(III) complex, along with two analogous mononuclear rhodamine&#8208;Gd(III) complexes, are reported. All complexes displayed good selectivity in a human glioma cell line (T98G) when compared to a glial cell line (SVG p12), with low cytotoxicities. Superior tumor cell uptake for these Gd(III) complexes was observed at lower incubation concentrations compared to previously&#8208;reported delocalized lipophilic cations such as a rhodamine&#8208;lanthanoid(III) probe and Gd(III)&#8208;arylphosphonium complexes, with ca. 150&#8201;% and 250&#8201;% increases in Gd uptake, respectively.

         <title>Unexpectedly Regioselective Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions of New Unsymmetrical Benzoquinones: A Convenient Synthetic Entry to Uniquely Substituted Decalins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report flexible synthesis of new unsymmetrically 2,6&#8208;disubstituted benzoquinones (33 examples) and their Diels&#8208;Alder reactions proceeding with high (and rather unpredictable) regioselectivity. These experimental findings were rationalized by DFT calculations and exploited in the convenient preparation of uniquely substituted and stereochemically defined decalins, and a novel forskolin analog with ethyl group at the fusion of the rings B and C.







Abstract
We report flexible synthesis of new unsymmetrically 2,6&#8208;disubstituted benzoquinones (33 examples) and a systematic study of their reactivity in the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. The Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of selected unsymmetrical benzoquinones with seemingly similar substituents were found to proceed with high regioselectivity and the formation of selected experimentally observed main products was rationalized by theoretical (DFT) calculations. The findings can be exploited in the convenient preparation of densely substituted and stereochemically defined decalins with unique angular substituents at ring fusion. We also demonstrate the usefulness of this methodology in complex molecule synthesis through the total synthesis of a novel forskolin analog possessing an ethyl group at the fusion of the rings B and C.

         <title>Cooperative NHC and Photoredox Catalyzed Radical Aminoacylation of Alkenes to Tetrahydropyridazines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) radical organocatalysis offers a powerful platform to construct valuable molecules. Herein, we report the synthesis of 1,4,5,6&#8208;tetrahydropyridazines through cooperative NHC/photoredox catalysis. The aminoacylation reaction involves a 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization of N&#8208;centered radicals, followed by radical&#8208;radical coupling of the resulting benzylic radicals with ketyl radicals, which are generated via single&#8208;electron reduction of in&#8197;situ formed acyl azolium ions.







Abstract
Tetrahydropyridazines constitute an important structural motif found in numerous natural products and pharmaceutical compounds. Herein, we report an aminoacylation reaction of alkenes that enables the synthesis of 1,4,5,6&#8208;tetrahydropyridazines through cooperative N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and photoredox catalysis. This approach involves the 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization of N&#8208;centered hydrazonyl radicals, generated via single&#8208;electron oxidation of hydrazones, followed by a radical&#8211;radical coupling step. The mild process tolerates a wide range of common functional groups and affords a variety of tetrahydropyridazines in moderate to high yields. Preliminary investigations using chiral NHC catalysts demonstrate the potential of this protocol for asymmetric radical reactions.

         <title>Enhanced Electrochemical Performance of NiMn Layered Double Hydroxides/Graphene Oxide Composites Synthesized by One&#8208;Step Hydrothermal Method for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the enhanced electrochemical performance of supercapacitors by optimizing electrode materials through the synthesis of NiMn layered double hydroxides combined with graphene oxide using a one&#8208;step hydrothermal method.







Abstract
This study aims to enhance the performance of supercapacitors, focusing particularly on optimizing electrode materials. While pure NiMn layered double hydroxides (LDHs) exhibit excellent electrochemical properties, they have limitations in achieving high specific capacitance. Therefore, this paper successfully synthesized composite materials of NiMn LDHs with varying loadings of graphene oxide (GO) using a hydrothermal method. Systematic physicochemical characterization of the synthesized materials, such as powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field&#8208;emission scanning electron microscopy (FE&#8208;SEM), and Raman spectroscopy, revealed the influence of GO doping on the microstructure and electrochemical performance of NiMn LDHs. Electrochemical tests demonstrated that the NiMn LDHs/GO electrode material exhibited optimal electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 2096&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 current density and 1471&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, when GO doping level was 0.45&#8197;wt&#8201;%. Furthermore, after 1000 cycles of stability testing, the material retained 53.3&#8201;% capacitance at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, indicating good cyclic stability. This study not only provides new directions for research on supercapacitor electrode materials but also offers new strategies for developing low&#8208;cost and efficient electrode materials.

This review presents an overview of recent advances in electrolytes in aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs). AIB electrolytes mainly include liquid and solid electrolytes. The main research directions in liquid electrolytes for AIBs mainly include electrolyte solutes, &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; (WIS) electrolytes, and electrolyte additives







Abstract
Aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs) are promising electrochemical energy storage sources because of their high theoretical specific capacity, light weight, zero pollution, safety, inexpensiveness, and abundant resources. These theoretical advantages have recently made AIBs a research hotspot. However, electrolyte&#8208;related issues significantly limit their commercialization. The electrolyte choices for AIBs are significantly limited, and most of the available options do not facilitate the Al3+/Al three&#8208;electron transfer reaction. Thus, this review presents an overview of recent advances in electrolytes and modification strategies for AIBs to clarify the limitations of existing AIB electrolytes and offer guidance for improving their performance. Furthermore, herein, the advantages, limitations and possible solutions for each electrolyte are discussed, after which the future of AIB electrolytes is envisioned.

         <title>Two&#8208;Fold Oxidative Coupling of Furan with Indole Provides Modular Access to a New Class of Tetra&#8208;(hetero)arylated Furans with up to Four Different Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly arylated propeller&#8208;shaped heteroarenes constitute an intriguing class of molecular scaffolds for material science applications. Among these, tetraarylated furans demonstrate differentiated properties as compared to other similar heterocyclic cores. The synthetic complexity to access tetraarylated furans increases significantly with increasing number of different peripheral aryl groups. There are only a very limited number of methodologies available to access furans with four different (hetero)aryl substituents. Notably, none of these involve direct oxidative coupling on the furan core as the method of choice. Herein, we report the first methodology based on a sequential two&#8208;fold oxidative C&#8208;C coupling of furans with indoles to access bis(indolyl)furans (BIFs) &#8208; a new class of &#8216;extremely congested&#8217; tetra&#8208;(hetero)arylated furans with up to four different substituents. The reaction is mediated by inexpensive, earth&#8208;abundant FeCl3.6H2O and displays high efficiency, wide substrate scope, modularity and aqueous compatibility. Moreover, we also present the first validation of the distinct aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) property of the tetraarylated furans beyond only phenyls as peripheral groups and disclose new mechanistic underpinnings for the same.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Interaction of Chiral Carbon Dots with Nucleic Acids: A Promising Nanosensing Platform</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dots (CDs) represent an emerging class of nanomaterials that combine outstanding photoluminescent properties with low toxicity and excellent biocompatibility. These unique features have garnered significant interest for potential applications in sensing as well as nanovectors for bioactive compounds. Within this context, the possibility of synthesizing chiral carbon dots (CCDs) has paved the way for a plethora of bioapplications in their interaction with chiral biomolecules. In this study we report the synthesis and characterization of CCDs with opposite chiralities and their selective interaction with nucleic acids. A systematic study on their interaction with different oligonucleotides (ODNs) using UV&#8208;vis, photoluminescence, and circular dichroism analyses highlighted how the chiral surface of the CCDs induces distinct spectroscopic responses in CCDs&#8208;ODN conjugates. These findings establish the foundation for innovative applications of CCDs as nanosensors and nanocarriers for nucleic acids. Additionally, the antioxidant properties of CCDs were investigated, highlighting their dual potential as both sensing and preservative nanomaterials for genetic material. Our results suggest significant implications for the development of chiral&#8208;specific diagnostic tools, drug delivery systems, and therapeutic agents. Furthermore, these properties open new avenues for the use of CCDs in antibiotic residue detection, fluorescence imaging, and photodynamic therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed [3+1+1] Cascade Cyclization of O&#8208;Acyl Oximes with Sulfur and Silyl Enol Ethers: Rapid Access to Naphthothiazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A three&#8208;component cyclization reaction of O&#8208;acyl oximes, silyl enol ethers and elemental sulfur has been developed, in which silyl enol ether acts as a C1 synthon to participate in cyclization reaction and build series of 2&#8208;aroylnaphthothiazoles and 2&#8208;aroylbenzothienothiazoles. The preliminary exploration of the reaction mechanism indicated that this transformation probably proceeded through a radical process, involving S3&#8226;&#8722; as a key intermediate, enabling subsequent nucleophilic substitution with O&#8208;acyl oximes to afford iminosulfur radical, which undergoes 1,3&#8208;H shift to yield sulfur&#8208;centered radical intermediate. And then this intermediate undergoes radical addition with silyl enol ether, leading to the formation of the titled products through intramolecular cyclization and oxidation. Moreover, the products obtained exhibit favorable fluorescence properties, which indicates their potential application as functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Synthesis of 3D Aligned VO2 and V2O5 Carbon Nanotube Hybrid Materials by Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>3D carbon nanotube hybrid materials containing VO2 and V2O5 evenly distributed onto vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (VACNTs) is reported. Adjustable loading of particles in controllable sizes onto the VACNTs was developed via a stepwise chemical vapour deposition (CVD) approach. Solid VO(acac)2 is chosen as vanadium source. CO2 acts as reactive gas for the pre&#8208;functionalisation of the VACNTs. The process temperature was identified as key parameter to control the deposited vanadium oxide phase. A temperature of 550&#176;C results in monoclinic VO2, while 600 &#176;C results in the deposition of V2O5 onto the VACNT support. The morphology and the amount of deposited material was found to be dependent on the reactor dimensions and the degree of functionalization of the carbon support. An increase of the D/G ratio of the VACNT from 0.75 to 1.08 caused by a CO2 treatment step within the process led to an increase of the particle coverage from a scarce coverage without prior CO2 treatment to a dense coverage of the VACNT support after 15 min of CO2 exposure time. Size and crystallinity of the as deposited particles can be further adjusted by a controlled heat treatment after VO(acac)2 precursor deposition.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust and Irreversible Sortase&#8208;Mediated Ligation by Empolyment of Sarkosyl</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sarkosyl significantly enhances sortase&#8208;mediated ligation by promoting substrate solubility, sorting motif accessibility and rendering reaction irreversibility, thereby leading to excellent ligation yields. Notably, this method is compatible with peptides or proteins capable of forming liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation, offering a powerful approach for conjugating aggregation&#8208;prone substrates in peptide and protein chemistry.







Abstract
Sortase&#8208;mediated ligation (SML) is a widely used method for peptide and protein ligation due to ease of substrate preparation and fast enzymatic kinetics. But there are drawbacks that limit broader applications. Sorting motif in substrates may not be exposed to sortase efficiently due to folding or aggregation. In addition, the ligation is reversible under transpeptidation equilibrium that restricts ligation yield. Here we report a simple but robust method to overcome such limitations. By employment of sarkosyl, the detergent alters substrate conformation to raise sorting motif accessibility for sortase catalysis. Moreover, transpeptidation becomes irreversible presumably by formation of micelle to shield ligation products from sortase. In consequence, excellent yields were achieved from sortase variants with different substrate specificity. Notably, this method is compatible with peptides or proteins capable of forming liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS), presenting a powerful approach for the conjugation of aggregation&#8208;prone substrates. Therefore, we believe the sarkosyl&#8208;enhanced SML could be widely applied in peptide and protein chemistry and the unique irreversible transpeptidation mechanism offers an insight to detergent&#8208;driven equilibrium.

The titanium azido complex [(Xy&#8208;N3N)TiN3] (1&#8208;N3) reacted with lithium metal or with alkali metal naphthalenides (alkali metal M=Na, K, and Rb) in THF to give the corresponding dinuclear &#956;2&#8208;nitrido complexes M[(Xy&#8208;N3N)Ti=N&#8208;Ti(Xy&#8208;N3N)] (2&#8208;M; M=Li, Na, K, Rb). While 2&#8208;Li and 2&#8208;K consist of a &#956;2&#8208;nitrido ligand with a linear Ti&#8722;N&#8722;Ti core, 2&#8208;Na contains a T&#8208;shape &#956;3&#8208;nitrido ligand with the sodium cation interacting with the aryl substituent.







Abstract
A series of titanium &#956;2&#8208;nitrido complexes supported by the triamidoamine ligand Xy&#8208;N3N (Xy&#8208;N3N={(3,5&#8208;Me2C6H3)NCH2CH2}3N3&#8722;) is reported. The titanium azido complex [(Xy&#8208;N3N)TiN3] (1&#8208;N3), prepared by salt metathesis of the chloride complex [(Xy&#8208;N3N)TiCl] (1&#8208;Cl) with NaN3, reacted with lithium metal or with alkali metal naphthalenides (alkali metal M=Na, K, and Rb) in THF to give the corresponding dinuclear &#956;2&#8208;nitrido complexes M[(Xy&#8208;N3N)Ti=N&#8208;Ti(Xy&#8208;N3N)] (2&#8208;M; M=Li, Na, K, Rb). Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of 2&#8208;Li, 2&#8208;Na, and 2&#8208;K revealed alkali metal dependent structures in the solid state. While 2&#8208;Li and 2&#8208;K contain a &#956;2&#8208;nitrido ligand with a linear Ti&#8722;N&#8722;Ti core, 2&#8208;Na includes a &#956;3&#8208;nitrido ligand as part of a T&#8208;shape Ti2NaN fragment with the sodium cation weekly coordinated to the nitrido nitrogen atom. When the synthesis of the nitrido complexes was carried out in the presence of excess alkali metals, decomposition of the nitrido complexes was observed affording some intractable titanium species along with the trialkali metal salts [M3(Xy&#8208;N3N)] (3&#8208;M) (M=Li, Na, K, and Rb). These salts were also prepared by deprotonation of (Xy&#8208;N3N)H3 with the corresponding alkali metal hexamethyldisilazide and characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy as well as single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Improving Environmental Stress Cracking Resistance of High&#8208;Density Polyethylene Grades by Comonomer Addition and Nanocomposite Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study aims to assess how polymer density, influenced by comonomer content and nanosilica addition, impacts the mechanical and ESCR of HDPE. Results showed varying tensile properties and ESCR based on comonomer content. Additionally, incorporating chemically modified nanosilica improved ESCR by 40&#8201;%, as revealed by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and NCI plots.







Abstract
The aim of this paper is to determine the effect of polymer density, correlated to the comonomer content, and nanosilica addition on the mechanical and Environmental Stress Cracking Resistance (ESCR) characteristics of high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE). In this regard, five HDPE samples with similar Melt Flow Index (MFI) and molar mass but various densities were acquired from a petrochemical plant. Two polymerization reactors work in series and differ only in the amount of 1&#8208;buene comonomer fed to the second reactor. To ascertain the microstructure of the studied samples, GPC and SSA (successive self&#8208;nucleation and annealing) analyses were accomplished. All samples resulted having similar characteristics but slightly various SCB/1000&#8197;C=7.26&#8211;9.74 (SCB=Short Chain Branching). Consequently, meanwhile studied HDPEs reveal similar notched impact and stress at yield values, the tensile modulus, stress&#8208;at&#8208;break, and elongation&#8208;at&#8208;break tend to demonstrate different results with the SCB content. More significantly, ESCR characteristic varied considerably with SCB/1000&#8197;C extent, so that higher amount of SCB acknowledged advanced ESCR. Notably, blending HDPE sample containing higher amount of SCB/1000&#8197;C, with 3&#8197;wt.% of chemically modified nanosilica enhanced ESCR characteristic by 40&#8201;%. DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations unveiled the role of the comonomer, quantitatively by binding energies and qualitatively by Non Covalent Interaction (NCI) plots.

         <title>Exploiting Nitroreductases for the Tailored Photoenzymatic Synthesis of Structurally Diverse Heterocyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tailored photoenzymatic synthesis of anthranils and quinolines from o&#8208;nitrophenyl&#8208;substituted carbonyl substrates has been achieved using the flavin&#8208;dependent nitroreductase BaNTR1 in cooperation with chlorophyll as photocatalyst. This tunable photoenzymatic system achieved high conversions (up to &gt;99&#8201;%) and good product yields (up to 96&#8201;%), performing the chemoselective reduction of the nitro group without reduction of the carbonyl moiety or the activated carbon&#8208;carbon double bond.







Abstract
N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds have a broad range of applications and their selective synthesis is very appealing for the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries. Herein we report the usage of the flavin&#8208;dependent nitroreductase BaNTR1 for the photoenzymatic synthesis of various anthranils and quinolines from retro&#8208;synthetically designed o&#8208;nitrophenyl&#8208;substituted carbonyl substrates, achieving high conversions (up to &gt;99&#8201;%) and good product yields (up to 96&#8201;%). Whereas the effective production of anthranils required the inclusion of H2O2 in the reaction mixtures to accumulate the needed hydroxylamine intermediates, the formation of quinolines required the use of anaerobic or reducing conditions to efficiently generate the essential amine intermediates. Critical to our success was the high chemoselectivity of BaNTR1, performing selective reduction of the nitro group without reduction of the carbonyl moiety or the activated carbon&#8208;carbon double bond. The results highlight the usefulness of an innocuous chlorophyll&#8208; and nitroreductase&#8208;based photoenzymatic system for the tailored synthesis of diverse N&#8208;heterocycles from simple nitro compounds.

An &#8220;in&#8208;ring establishing&#8221; strategy has afforded a molecular necklace from two almost&#8208;90&#176;&#8208;oriented dialdehydes, two almost&#8208;90&#176;&#8208;oriented diamines, four macrocycles, and four Zn2+ ions, in an overall yield of 69&#8201;% over three steps (assembly, imine reduction, and amine protonation).







Abstract
Herein we demonstrate an &#8220;in&#8208;ring establishing&#8221; strategy for assembling interlocked molecules through dynamic imine formation, &#8220;establishing&#8221; the host recognition sites in&#8197;situ. Using Zn2+ ions to template the assembly of a pyridine&#8208;containing macrocycle with semidumbbell&#8208;shaped triazole&#8208;containing aldehyde and amine derivatives, we obtained the corresponding [2]rotaxane in high yield (85&#8201;%) after subsequent imine reduction (NaBH4) and amine protonation (NH4PF6). We performed the same three steps (assembly, reduction, protonation) to prepare a stable and highly symmetrical [5]molecular necklace ([5]MN) from 12 components (two almost&#8208;90&#176;&#8208;oriented dialdehydes, two almost&#8208;90&#176;&#8208;oriented diamines, four macrocycles, four Zn2+ ions) in an overall yield of 69&#8201;%.

         <title>A Highly Selective Fluorescent Probe for Monitoring the Thyroid Hormone Transporter Activity in Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes the first example of a highly selective fluorescent probe for the transmembrane thyroid hormone transporter, monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8). The halogen bond forming ability of the iodine atoms with the transporter and the presence of a free carboxylic acid group are essential for the MCT8 selectivity.







Abstract
Monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) is a trans&#8208;membrane transporter, which mediates the cellular delivery of thyroid hormones, L&#8208;thyroxine (T4) and 3,5,3&#8242;&#8208;triiodo&#8208;L&#8208;thyronine (T3). In humans, the MCT8 protein is encoded by the SLC16A2 gene and mutations in the transporter cause a genetic neurological disorder known as Allan&#8208;Herndon&#8208;Dudley Syndrome (AHDS). MCT8 deficiency leads to impaired transport of thyroid hormones in the brain. Radiolabelled T4 and T3 or LC/MS&#8208;MS methods have been used to monitor the thyroid hormone uptake through MCT8. Herein, we developed a fluorescent based assay to monitor the thyroid hormone uptake through MCT8. A dansyl&#8208;based fluorescent probe having L&#8208;thyroxine moiety is found to be highly selective towards MCT8 in living cells. The high selectivity of the probe towards MCT8 can be attributed to the halogen bond&#8208;mediated recognition by the transporter protein. The presence of a free carboxylic acid group is essential for the specificity of the probe towards MCT8. Additionally, the selectivity of the probe for MCT8 is abolished upon esterification of the carboxylic group. Similarly, MCT8 does not recognize the probe when it contains a free amine group.

&lt;p&gt;Monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) is a trans-membrane transporter, which mediates the cellular delivery of thyroid hormones, L-thyroxine (T4) and 3,5,3&#8242;-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3). In humans, the MCT8 protein is encoded by the SLC16A2 gene and mutations in the transporter cause a genetic neurological disorder known as Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome (AHDS). MCT8 deficiency leads to impaired transport of thyroid hormones in the brain. Radiolabelled T4 and T3 or LC/MS-MS methods have been used to monitor the thyroid hormone uptake through MCT8. Herein, we developed a fluorescent based assay to monitor the thyroid hormone uptake through MCT8. A dansyl-based fluorescent probe having L-thyroxine moiety is found to be highly selective towards MCT8 in living cells. The high selectivity of the probe towards MCT8 can be attributed to the halogen bond-mediated recognition by the transporter protein. The presence of a free carboxylic acid group is essential for the specificity of the probe towards MCT8. Additionally, the selectivity of the probe for MCT8 is abolished upon esterification of the carboxylic group. Similarly, MCT8 does not recognize the probe when it contains a free amine group.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
