         <title>Influence of Achiral Phosphine Ligands on a Synergistic Organo&#8208; and Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present an unusual diastereodivergent stereoselective allylation reaction. It consists of a palladium&#8208;catalyzed allylation reaction of an organocatalytically generated amino isobenzofulvene, where the diastereoselectivity is controlled by the electronic properties of a monodentate, achiral ligand on palladium. One major diastereoisomer is formed using triarylphosphines substituted with neutral or electron&#8208;donating substituents of the aryl group, while those with electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents favor the other diastereoisomer. The diastereoselectivity correlates with the Taft inductive parameter of substituents on the triarylphosphine ligand on palladium. The synergistic reaction involves both a catalytic secondary amine catalyst for the indene&#8208;aldehyde activation and the monodentate phosphine ligands on palladium, affording a highly enantioselective reaction with up to 98% enantiomeric excess. Based on computational investigations, the role of the monodentate phosphine ligand on the diastereoselectivity is discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic nitrene transfer by an FeIV imido complex generated by a comproportionation process</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrene transfer reactions have emerged among the most powerful and versatile ways to insert an amine function to various kinds of hydrocarbon substrates. However, the mechanisms of nitrene generation have not been studied in depth albeit their formation is taken for granted in most cases without definitive evidence of their occurrence. In the present work, we compare the generation of tosylimido iron species and NTs transfer from Fe  II  and Fe  III  precursors where the metal is embedded in a tetracarbene macrocycle. Catalytic nitrene transfer to reference substrates (thioanisole, styrene, ethylbenzene and cyclohexane) revealed that the same active species was at play, irrespective of the ferrous vs ferric nature of the precursor. Through combination of spectroscopic (UV&#8208;visible, M&#246;ssbauer), ESI&#8208;MS and DFT studies, an Fe  IV  tosylimido species was identified as the catalytically active species and was characterized spectroscopically and computationally. Whereas its formation from the Fe  II  precursor was expected by a two&#8208;electron oxidative addition, its formation from a Fe  III  precursor was unprecedented. Thanks to a combination of spectroscopic (UV&#8208;visible, EPR, Hyscore and M&#246;ssbauer), ESI&#8208;MS and DFT studies, we found that, when starting from the Fe  III  precursor, an Fe  III  tosyliodinane adduct was formed and decomposed into an Fe  V  tosylimido species which generated the catalytically active Fe  IV  tosylimide through a comproportionation process with the Fe  III  precursor.</dc:description>

         <title>A Porous Polyaromatic Solid for Vapor Adsorption of Xylene with High Efficiency, Selectivity, and Reusability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of porous materials capable of capturing volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as benzene and its derivatives, with high efficiency, selectivity, and reusability is highly demanded. Here we report unusual vapor adsorption behavior toward VOCs by a new porous solid, composed of a polyaromatic capsule bearing a spherical nanocavity with subnano&#8208;sized windows. Without prior crystallization and high&#8208;temperature vacuum drying, the porous polyaromatic solids exhibit the following five features: vapor adsorption of benzene over cyclohexane with 90% selectivity, high affinity toward  o  &#8208;xylene over benzene and toluene with &gt;80% selectivity,  ortho  &#8208;selective adsorption ability (&gt;50%) from mixed xylene isomers, tight VOCs storage even under high temperature and vacuum conditions, and at least 5 times reusability for xylene adsorption. The observed adsorption abilities are accomplished at ambient temperature and pressure within 1 h, which has not been demonstrated by organic/inorganic porous materials reported previously.</dc:description>

         <title>Inducing Propeller Chirality in Triaryl Boranes with Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>: Stabilization of chiral propeller conformations in triaryl compounds is challenging due to generally low racemization barriers. Nonetheless, it was recently found that chiral conformational preferences can be induced to triaryl boranes by incorporating point&#8208;chiral alkylether chains to the aryl blades and subsequently locking the structure with ammonia. A four&#8208;point interaction, that means the cooperative effects of Lewis&#8208;adduct formation and three hydrogen bonds, was proposed as stabilizing mechanism. Herein, we show that three such strong interactions suffice to introduce a preferential propeller handedness. While DFT calculations predict no noteworthy preferences for either P&#8208; or M&#8208;chiral propellers for some of the investigated triarylborane&#8208;amine adducts that were prepared with chiral primary amines, vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopic characterizations revealed that there is indeed a measurable excess of one propeller handedness. Furthermore, the steric demand of the amine was found to play a key role in the induction process and especially in preventing blade rotations.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbodicarbenes and Striking Redox Transitions of their Conjugate Acids: Influence of NHC vs. CAAC as Donor Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a new type of carbodicarbene (CDC) comprising two different classes of carbenes; NHC and CAAC as donor substituents and compare the molecular structure and coordination to Au(I)Cl to those of NHC&#8208;only and CAAC&#8208;only analogues. The conjugate acids of these three CDCs exhibit notable redox properties. Their reactions with [NO][SbF6] were investigated. The reduction of the conjugate acid of CAAC&#8208;only based CDC with KC 8 results in the formation of hydrogen abstracted/eliminated products which proceed through a neutral radical intermediate, detected by EPR spectroscopy. In contrast, the reduction of conjugate acids of NHC&#8208;only and NHC/CAAC based CDCs led to intermolecular reductive (reversible) carbon&#8208;carbon sigma bond formation. The resulting relatively elongated carbon&#8208;carbon sigma bonds were found to be readily oxidized. They were, thus, demonstrated to be potent reducing agents, underlining their potential utility as organic electron donors and n&#8208;dopants in organic semiconductor molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>The  Core/shell Structure P &#160;doped MoS2@Ni3S2  &#160;Nanorods &#160;Array  for&#160;High Current Density&#160;Hydrogen Evolution in Alkaline and Acidic Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalysis is the most promising strategy to generate clean energy H2  , and the development of catalysts with excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance at high current density that can resist strong alkaline and acidic electrolyte environment is great significance for practical industrial application. Therefore, a P doped MoS2@Ni3S2  &#160;nanorods array (named P&#8208;NiMoS) was successfully synthesized through successive sulfuration and phosphorization, the P&#8208;NiMoS presents core/shell structure with heterojunction between MoS2  (shell)&#160;and Ni3S2  &#160;(core).

Therefore, a P doped MoS2@Ni3S2  &#160;nanorods array (named P-NiMoS) was successfully synthesized through successive sulfuration and phosphorization, the P-NiMoS presents core/shell structure with heterojunction between MoS2  (shell)&#160;and Ni3S2  &#160;(core). Furthermore, the doping of P modulates the electronic structure of the P-NiMoS, the electrons transfer from the t2g  &#160;orbital of Ni element to the eg  &#160;empty orbital of Mo element through Ni-S-Mo bond at Ni3S2  &#160;and MoS2  &#160;heterojunction, facilitating hydrogen evolution reaction.&#160;As a result, P-NiMoS exhibits excellent HER activity, the overpotential is 290 mV at high current density 250 mA cm-2  &#160;in alkaline electrolyte, which is close to Pt/C (282 mV@250 mA cm-2  ), and P-NiMoS can stably evolve hydrogen for 48 h.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Peri&#8208;Functionalized Tetraazaperylenes: Strong Emitters for Molecular Polaritonics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functionalization of the  peri  position of the  bay  chlorinated tetraazaperylene was investigated by varying the donor behavior of the substituents to assess the resulting photophysical and electrochemical properties. To accomplish this, electron donating alkyl&#8208; and arylsulfido substituents, methoxy and methyl groups were selectively introduced into the  peri  position via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution of the perchlorinated tetraazaperylene. Both the alkylated and benzylated thioethers displayed high fluorescence quantum yields of up to 80%. Compounds from the latter group were integrated in resonant optical microcavities to achieve strong light&#8208;matter coupling. The formation of exciton&#8208;polaritons was observed by angle&#8208;dependent reflectivity and photoluminescence that could be tuned by variation of the concentration of the fluorophores and of the thickness of the cavity.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism of BPh3&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Methylation of Amines with CO2 and Phenylsilane: Cooperative Activation of Hydrosilane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BPh3 smoothly catalyzes the N&#8208;methylation of N&#8208;methylaniline with CO2 and PhSiH3. A zwitterionic carbamate, composed of N&#8208;methylaniline and CO2, and BPh3 act as nucleophile and Lewis acid, respectively, for the activation of PhSiH3 to generate [HBPh3]&#8722;, which is used to produce the silyl formate and bis(silyl)acetal that are essential for N&#8208;methylation.







Abstract
BPh3 catalyzes the N&#8208;methylation of secondary amines and the C&#8208;methylenation (methylene&#8208;bridge formation between aromatic rings) of N,N&#8208;dimethylanilines or 1&#8208;methylindoles in the presence of CO2 and PhSiH3; these reactions proceed at 30&#8211;40&#8201;&#176;C under solvent&#8208;free conditions. In contrast, B(C6F5)3 shows little or no activity. 11B&#8197;NMR spectra suggested the generation of [HBPh3]&#8722;. The detailed mechanism of the BPh3&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;methylation of N&#8208;methylaniline (1) with CO2 and PhSiH3 was studied by using DFT calculations. BPh3 promotes the conversion of two substrates (N&#8208;methylaniline and CO2) into a zwitterionic carbamate to give three&#8208;component species [Ph(Me)(H)N+CO2&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;BPh3]. The carbamate and BPh3 act as the nucleophile and Lewis acid, respectively, for the activation of PhSiH3 to generate [HBPh3]&#8722;, which is used to produce key CO2&#8208;derived species, such as silyl formate and bis(silyl)acetal, essential for the N&#8208;methylation of 1. DFT calculations also suggested other mechanisms involving water for the generation of [HBPh3]&#8722; species.

         <title>Thioxanthylium Cations: Highly Reversible Hydrochromic Mate&#8208;rials with Tunable Color and Moisture Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrochromism of thioxanthylium cations/ thioxanthene&#8208;9&#8208;ol can be tuned by structural functionalization to offer diverse colors and moisture&#8208;sensitivities. This reversible hydrochromic system is easily activated with organic acid from chemically stable precursors, allowing for possible uses in moisture&#8208;sensing and anti&#8208;counterfeiting encryption.







Abstract
Hydrochromic materials, which change color in response to moisture, are highly sought&#8208;after due to some unique applications such as moisture detection, humidity monitoring, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and sweat&#8208;pore mapping. We herein report a new thioxanthene&#8208;9&#8208;ols/thioxanthylium cations hydrochromic system. The hydrochromic thioxanthylium cations can be generated/regenerated by exposing a chemically stable thioxanthene&#8208;9&#8208;ol to trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The intensely colored thioxanthylium cations can be chemically reverted to the colorless thioxanthene&#8208;9&#8208;ol. Interestingly, the conversion between thioxanthene&#8208;9&#8208;ol and its cation species was found to be highly reversible in most cases (up to 50 activation&#8208;deactivation cycles). The color and moisture&#8208;sensitivity of thioxanthylium cations were also validated to be tunable via functionalization of the thioxanthene core with different aliphatic and aromatic groups at its 9 or 2,7&#8208;positions. Finally, paper probes were prepared using solution&#8208;immersion and inkjet&#8208;printing techniques to demonstrate the system's potential applications in humidity sensing and anti&#8208;counterfeiting

         <title>Long&#8208;Term, Single&#8208;Molecule Imaging of Proteins in Live Cells with Photoregulated Fluxional Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) can reveal nanometric details of biological samples, but its high phototoxicity hampers long&#8208;term imaging in live specimens. A significant part of this phototoxicity stems from repeated irradiations that are necessary for controlled switching of fluorophores to maintain the sparse labeling of the sample. Lower phototoxicity can be obtained using fluorophores that blink spontaneously, but controlling the density of single&#8208;molecule emitters is challenging. We recently developed photoregulated fluxional fluorophores (PFFs) that combine the benefits of spontaneously blinking dyes with photocontrol of emitter density. These dyes, however, were limited to imaging acidic organelles in live cells. Here, we report a systematic study of PFFs that culminates in probes that are functional at physiological pH and operate at longer wavelengths than their predecessors. Moreover, these probes are compatible with HaloTag labeling, thus enabling timelapse, single&#8208;molecule imaging of specific protein targets for exceptionally long times.</dc:description>

We recently developed photoregulated fluxional fluorophores (PFFs) that combine the benefits of spontaneously blinking dyes with photocontrol of emitter density. These dyes, however, were limited to imaging acidic organelles in live cells. Here, we report a systematic study of PFFs that culminates in probes that are functional at physiological pH and operate at longer wavelengths than their predecessors. Moreover, these probes are compatible with HaloTag labeling, thus enabling timelapse, single-molecule imaging of specific protein targets for exceptionally long times.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Optimized Ni&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8208;Lam Type Coupling: Enantioretentive Access to Chiral N&#8208;Aryl Sulfinamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8208;N bond formation takes on a critical significance in reactions of organic synthesis, material production and pharmaceutical manufactory. Chan&#8208;Lam has proposed a useful methodology to furnish secondary arylamides under mild conditions. However, when the chiral sulfinamides serve as the coupling precursors, the Cu&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction is found with low efficacy. Complex side products are generated under the classic conditions. Moreover, it led to the racemization of the coupling product. In this study, an optimized Ni&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8208;Lam type coupling conditions were optimized, which resulted in a clean conversion with chiral sulfinamides and arylboronic acids to offer N&#8208;aryl sulfinamides efficiently and enantioretentively. The trans&#8208;N  1  ,N  2  &#8208;dimethylcyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine were proven as the most efficient ligand. Under the optimized conditions, serious chiral N&#8208;aryl sulfinamides were prepared with high chemical yield without racemization. Furthermore, a plausible and novel mechanism was proposed. Interestingly, the method could efficiently furnish a wide variety of C&#8208;X bonds by coupling arylboronic acids with different Nucleophiles.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, pnictogen (Pn)&#8208;bridged diphenyl sulfones were synthesized as motifs for photoinduced dynamic rearrangement. The newly synthesized sulfones exhibited dual fluorescence at 298 K. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the longer&#8208;wavelength fluorescence was derived from the geometries after structural relaxation through photo&#8208;driven pnictogen bond formation between the O atom lone pair of the sulfonyl moiety and the antibonding orbital of the Pn&#8211;C bond. This is the first report on emission dynamics driven by pnictogen bond formation upon photoexcitation.</dc:description>

         <title>Acridone&#8208;Based Host Materials for Green Phosphorescent and Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent OLEDs with Low&#8208; Efficiency Roll&#8208;Offs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By linking carbazole unit to nitrogen atom of acridone through phenyl and or pyridyl, two compounds , named 10&#8208;(4&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)acridin&#8208;9(10H)&#8208;one (AC&#8208;Ph&#8208;Cz) and 10&#8208;(5&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acridin&#8208;9(10H)&#8208;one (AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz) were designed and synthesized. These two materials, characterized with highly twisted and rigid structure, good thermal stability, and balanced carrier&#8208;transporting properties, were employed as host materials for green phosphorescent and thermally activated delayed fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Carbazole group, despite its small contribution to the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of these two materials, plays an essential role as an intramolecular host in energy delivering and improving the hole transporting ability of these two hosts. The incorporation of the electron&#8208;deficient pyridyl as a linking group slightly improve s the electron transporting capability of AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz . The green phosphorescent OLED (PhOLED) based on AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz exhibited excellent device performance with a turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.5 V, maximum power efficiency and external quantum efficiency (  &#951;  ext  ) of 89.8 lm W  &#8208;1  and 25.2%, respectively, benefitting from the better charge balancing ability of AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz host due to the presence of pyridyl bridge. More importantly, all the devices based on these two hosts showed low efficiency roll&#8208;off at high brightness due to the suppressed non&#8208;radiative transition in the emitting layer. In particular, AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz hosted green PhOLED exhibited an efficiency roll&#8208;off of 1.6% from the maximum &#951;ext at a high brightness of 1000 cd m  &#8208;2  and a roll&#8208;off of 15.9% at an extremely high brightness of 10000 cd m  &#8208;2  . This study manifests that acridone &#8208; based host materials have great potential in fabricating OLEDs with low efficiency roll&#8208;off.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Metal&#8208;Encapsulated Double&#8208;Cage [Pt@Sn17]4&#8722;: An Exception from Group 14 Endohedral Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Group 14 endohedral clusters containing a metal center inside usually possess a single cage topological structure, but here we report an unexpected single&#8208;metal&#8208;filled double&#8208;cage cluster, [Pt@Sn  17  ]  4  &#8722;  (  1a  ). It can be seen as a combination of the more extended Pt&#8208;filled [Pt@Sn  9  ] cage and hollow [Sn  9  ] cage sharing a central Sn atom, which is offset from the central position. This double&#8208;cage species represents the largest group 14 intermetalloid cluster encapsulating a single transition metal atom. DFT calculations show that the capsule&#8208;like architecture of [Sn  17  ]  4  &#8722;  , similar to that found in [Pt  2  @Sn  17  ]  4  &#8722;  , is not thermodynamically stable if filled with a single Pt atom and collapses to the title cluster  1a  upon geometry optimization. Deviation of the central Sn atom occurs due to the vibronic coupling as a consequence of pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion leading to the bent  C  s  &#8208;symmetrical structure, in contrast to the more symmetrical  D  2d  cage previously reported in [Ni  2  @Sn  17  ]  4  &#8722;  .</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemically Enhanced Emission by Introducing Rational Photoactive Subunits into an Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we propose a rational design strategy by introducing photoactive thienyl and pyridyl groups into an AIE&#8208;active tetraarylethene skeleton to achieve highly efficient photochemistry&#8208;activated fluorescence enhancement from dominantly photo&#8208;physical aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior, and prove that such photoactivated fluorescence enhancement is perfectly suited for super stable photocontrollable dual&#8208;mode patterning applications in both solution and solid matrix. It is found that the photoactivated fluorescence of designed AIEgen is attributed to the irreversible cyclized&#8208;dehydrogenation reaction under UV irradiation, and the oxidation product has a brighter fluorescence in both solution and solid states owning to its rigid and planar structure. The overall transformation rate of the AIEgen from its opened form to dehydrogenated form is up to nearly 100% in a short period of UV irradiation, and the fast transformation and the stable product of this photochemical reaction guarantees super stability of photocontrolled patterning, which can be applied in photoactivated dual&#8208;mode patterning and advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting.</dc:description>

This strategy allowed modulation of the substituents at the different positions based on the choice of Fischer's alkynyl carbenes, oxazolones and aldehydes used as precursors. The substituent variation at positions 2, 6, 3 and 5 had the greatest effect on the modulation of their photophysical properties such as absorption (&#955;  abs  ) and emission (&#955;  em  ) wavelengths, extinction coefficient (&#949;), quantum yields (&#966;), Stokes shifts (&#916;&#957;), fluorescence decay, radiative (k  rad  ) and non&#8208;radiative (k  nr  ) constants and the CIE 1931 coordinates. Theoretical calculations allowed to corroborate the effect of the substituents of  meso  &#8208;position on the modification of the dihedral angles. Cyclic voltammetry studies revealed that the BODIPY series presents similar redox potential behavior, being electrochemically active even in successive cycles, which suggests that transport by diffusion is the dominant process.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Highly Accessible and Reactive Sites in Gold Nanoparticles Using Bound Bis(diphenylphosphine) Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While bound organic ligands provide steric protection against aggregation for metallic nanoparticles in solution, they can block a large fraction of the surface atoms which are needed for binding in catalysis and sensing applications. In this work, highly accessible Au nanoparticles ligated with bis(diphenylphosphine) molecules are synthesized and characterized in solution.&#160;&#160;Characterization is performed using high angle annular dark field&#8208;scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF&#8208;STEM), ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV&#8208;Vis) spectroscopy, and fluorescence chemisorption experiments. These synthesized nanoparticles are accessible to a 2&#8208;napthalenethiol (2&#8208;NT) probe molecule in solution. The highest 2&#8208;NT accessibility is observed when using 1,1&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)methane (dppm) ligand where 61% of the total gold atoms are accessible. It is hypothesized that increasing the rigidity of the bis(diphenylphosphine) ligand increases the number of binding sites on the Au nanoparticles. These nanoparticles are catalytically active for resazurin reduction, and the resazurin reduction rate scales with the number of binding sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of the Coordinated Transition Metal Ion on Magnetic Relaxation of Lanthanide Based Complexes with Imino Nitroxide Biradical Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two series of biradical&#8208;metal complexes have been obtained by using an imino nitroxide biradical. Remarkably one magnetic process is found for the Dy&#8208;biradical compound while the Dy&#8722;Cu&#8208;radical compound exhibits dual relaxation processes which indicates that the second coordination sphere of Dy ion plays a crucial role in magnetic relaxation behavior.







Abstract
In spite of achievement of a lot of Ln&#8208;radical SMMs, how to improve magnetic behavior of Ln&#8208;radical system remains challenging. Here, two series of Ln&#8208;radical complexes have successfully been built using an imino nitroxide biradical, namely, [Ln2(hfac)6(ImPhPyobis)2] (LnIII=Gd 1, Tb 2, Dy 3) and [Ln2Cu2(hfac)10(ImPhPyobis)2] (LnIII=Gd 4, Dy 5; hfac=hexafluoroacetylacetonate and ImPhPyobis=5&#8208;(4&#8208;oxypyridinium&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(1&#8217;&#8208;oxyl&#8208;4&#8217;,4&#8217;,5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;hydro&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene). For these biradical&#8208;metal complexes, two imino nitroxide biradicals bind two Ln(III) ions via their oxygen atoms coming from 4&#8208;oxypyridinium units to produce a binuclear {Ln2O2} unit. Those imino nitroxide groups are free for complexes 1&#8211;3, however one of imino nitroxide groups of the biradical is ligated to the copper(II) ion for complexes 4 and 5. The distinct magnetic relaxation behaviors are observed for two Dy derivatives, as revealed by ac magnetic studies: complex 3 presents one magnetic process with the effective energy barrier(Ueff) of 74.0&#8197;K while complex 5 exhibits dual relaxation processes with Ueff values for the fast&#8208; and slow&#8208;relaxation being 20.2&#8197;K and 30.9&#8197;K, respectively, which implies that the second coordination sphere of Dy ion plays a critical role for magnetic relaxation.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Cyclization of 1,6&#8208;Enynes through Intramolecular Chlorine Transfer as a Novel Strategy for Asymmetric Halopalladation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intramolecular chlorine transfer strategy for enantioselective halopalladation cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes has been established to build versatile and functionally diverse &#945;&#8208;chloromethylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones in excellent E selectivity and enantioselectivity with good functional&#8208;group compatibility. This strategy provides a novel approach to asymmetric halopalladation and an alternative for synthesizing complex natural products.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cyclization of enynes has contributed significantly to the construction of chiral cyclic molecules. In contrast, the catalytic asymmetric cyclization involving halopalladation remains an unresolved challenge with the inevitable disturbance of the halide ions. Herein, an intramolecular chlorine transfer strategy is used to accomplish the enantioselective chloropalladation cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes. This reaction provides a redox&#8208;neutral approach to a variety of chiral &#945;&#8208;chloromethylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones with excellent E selectivity and enantioselectivity. The precisely controlled coordination of palladium with both the in&#8197;situ generated nucleophilic species and the monodentate phosphoramidite ligand is crucial for enantioselectivity.

         <title>Using Macrocyclic G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligands to Decipher the Interactions Between Small Molecules and G&#8208;Quadruplex DNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Binding: This study aims to add a deeper level of knowledge to the binding interactions between G4&#8208;ligands and G4 DNA to advance the design of improved G4&#8208;ligands. This is achieved by biophysical and physicochemical evaluations complemented by computational studies of both novel and well&#8208;known G4&#8208;ligands.







Abstract
This study aims to deepen the knowledge of the current state of rational G4&#8208;ligand design through the design and synthesis of a novel set of compounds based on indoles, quinolines, and benzofurans and their comparisons with well&#8208;known G4&#8208;ligands. This resulted in novel synthetic methods and G4&#8208;ligands that bind and stabilize G4 DNA with high selectivity. Furthermore, the study corroborates previous studies on the design of G4&#8208;ligands and adds deeper explanations to why a) macrocycles offer advantages in terms of G4&#8208;binding and &#8208;selectivity, b) molecular pre&#8208;organization is of key importance in the development of strong novel binders, c) an electron&#8208;deficient aromatic core is essential to engage in strong arene&#8208;arene interactions with the G4&#8208;surface, and d) aliphatic amines can strengthen interactions indirectly through changing the arene electrostatic nature of the compound. Finally, fundamental physicochemical properties of selected G4&#8208;binders are evaluated, underscoring the complexity of aligning the properties required for efficient G4 binding and stabilization with feasible pharmacokinetic properties.

Peptide self&#8208;assembling: Both, solid&#8208;state form and stereochemistry significantly influence a self&#8208;assembly process of a cyclic dipeptide, Tyr&#8208;Tyr (cYY), leading to a soft matter with different morphology and rheological properties.







Abstract
In this work a relationship between the crystal form and morphology and rheological properties of peptide&#8208;based hydrogels is examined. We show, that under favorable circumstances a correlation between a starting solid material and a self&#8208;assembly processes in solution can exist, leading to different properties of a resulting soft matter. This observation, together with an in&#8208;depth analysis of the influence of stereochemistry of self&#8208;assembled (ll) and (dl) Tyr&#8208;Tyr cyclic dipeptides (cYY) on the observed relationship between gelation and crystallization allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the peptide hydrogelation processes at a molecular level, using liquid state NMR, rheological studies and scanning electron microscopy. In the course of our studies, several crystal forms of (ll)&#8208;cYY has been discovered and described in details using single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, as well as advanced solid state NMR, X&#8208;ray diffraction of powders, thermal analysis, FTIR, circular dichroism and crystal structure prediction (CSP) calculations. Subsequently, we found that while (ll)&#8208;cYY easily assembles into hydrogels with different properties depending on the starting solid form, (dl)&#8208;cYY always precipitated as one crystal form in the tested conditions. Molecular&#8208;level justification for this observation is given.

         <title>Solar Driven Gas Phase Advanced Oxidation Processes for Methane Removal &#8208; Challenges and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas and the second highest contributor to global warming. Developing large&#8208;scale methane removal methods is one of the most effective strategies to reduce rapidly the CH4 emissions and thus to limit global warming. Challenges and prospects of solar&#8208;driven gas phase advanced oxidation processes for CH4 removal are analyzed.







Abstract
Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas and the second highest contributor to global warming. CH4 emissions are still growing at an alarmingly high pace. To limit global warming to 1.5&#8201;&#176;C, one of the most effective strategies is to reduce rapidly the CH4 emissions by developing large&#8208;scale methane removal methods. The purpose of this perspective paper is threefold. (1) To highlight the technology gap dealing with low concentration CH4 (at many emission sources and in the atmosphere). (2) To analyze the challenges and prospects of solar&#8208;driven gas phase advanced oxidation processes for CH4 removal. And (3) to propose some ideas, which may help to develop solar&#8208;driven gas phase advanced oxidation processes and make them deployable at a climate significant scale.

         <title>Spontaneous Synthesis of [FeII(Atrz)3]SO4 and its Analogues Through Accelerated Ageing: New Insights from Small&#8208;Scale Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accelerated ageing can be used to synthesize functional materials including spin crossover systems. Reactions proceed between a metal salt and a ligand placed in contact in a humid environment without any solvent or applied energy. Optical microscopy of small&#8208;scale reactions can be used to derive mechanistic information about accelerated ageing.







Abstract
Accelerated ageing reactions that take place between two solid materials on contact in the absence of added solvent have been used to synthesize two spin&#8208;crossover&#8208;active 1D coordination polymers and one of their Cu(II) analogues. The hygroscopy of the ligands and the relative humidity of the reaction chamber have been shown to be particularly important factors in the rate of reaction. Small&#8208;scale reactions between a few individual crystals have allowed observation of deliquescence of the 4&#8208;aminotriazole ligand at high humidity. The metal salt does not dissolve, and the ligand diffuses into the crystal of the metal salt during the reaction. In the case of the Cu analogue, the formation of the product causes the crystal of the metal salt to deform with the formation of pseudocrystals, which have a fibrous structure.

         <title>Design of a Photocatalytic [2+2] Cycloaddition Reaction Using Redox&#8208;Tag Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new photocatalytic [2+2] cycloaddition reaction based on our Redox&#8208;Tag strategy was developed involving carefully designed substrates which turned out to be effective for the reaction. A radical cation was formed by oxidative single electron transfer (SET) that immediately reacted with an alkene. An aryl radical cation was generated by intramolecular SET and during the subsequent reductive SET a cyclobutane was formed.







Abstract
The design of photocatalytic processes is important for a sustainable society. Key to these photocatalytic reactions is electron transfer. This article is focused on titanium dioxide photocatalyzed organic synthesis and the design of a new [2+2] cycloaddition reaction based on the electron transfer process. Electron transfer &#8208; not only between the substrate and the photocatalyst but also inter&#8208; and intramolecularly &#8211; is crucial for the reaction design. Radical cations were generated by the photocatalyst and trapped by alkenes. The resultant cyclobutyl radical cations were immediately reduced by the aryl rings via intramolecular electron transfer to obtain cyclobutane rings. The outcome of the reaction was controlled by substitution of the aryl ring and the linker connecting the aryl ring to the enol ether. The carefully designed substrates were highly effective for photocatalytic cycloaddition.

         <title>Substituted Cyclopentannulated Tetraazapentacenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of bromine substituents into cyclopentannulated tetraazapentacenes allows post&#8208;functionalization, for example through Sonogashira coupling and Rosenmund&#8208;von Braun reaction. The altered properties of the resulting new compounds were examined by experimental and computational methods, and the potential use as organic field&#8208;effect transistors was demonstrated.







Abstract
Brominated pentannulated dihydrotetraazapentacenes were prepared by gold&#8208; or palladium&#8208;catalyzed 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization of TIPS&#8208;ethynylated dihydrotetraazaacenes (TIPS = triisopropylsilyl). Post&#8208;functionalization was demonstrated by Sonogashira alkynylation and Rosenmund&#8208;von Braun cyanation. Calculations predict these species to act as n&#8208;type semiconductors, which was verified for two derivates through characterization in organic field&#8208;effect transistors.

         <dc:description>
X&#8208;ray structures of diol dehydratase (DD) and ethanolamine ammonia&#8208;lyase (EAL) complexed with adenosylmethylcobalamin (AdoMeCbl) were determined to get insights into the very low activity of AdoMeCbl. The DD active site is flexible, and AdoMeCbl binding causes large conformational changes that leave DD in the inactive state (left). The EAL active site is rigid and its binding does not induce significant conformational change (right).







Abstract
The X&#8208;ray structures of coenzyme B12 (AdoCbl)&#8208;dependent eliminating isomerases complexed with adenosylmethylcobalamin (AdoMeCbl) have been determined. As judged from geometries, the Co&#8722;C bond in diol dehydratase (DD) is not activated even in the presence of substrate. In ethanolamine ammonia&#8208;lyase (EAL), the bond is elongated in the absence of substrate; in the presence of substrate, the complex likely exists in both pre&#8208; and post&#8208;homolysis states. The impacts of incorporating an extra CH2 group are different in the two enzymes: the DD active site is flexible, and AdoMeCbl binding causes large conformational changes that make DD unable to adopt the catalytic state, whereas the EAL active site is rigid, and AdoMeCbl binding does not induce significant conformational changes. Such flexibility and rigidity of the active sites might reflect the tightness of adenine binding. The structures provide good insights into the basis of the very low activity of AdoMeCbl in these enzymes.

         <title>Cu3(HHTP)2 c&#8208;MOF/ZnO Ultrafast Ultraviolet Photodetector for Wearable Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wearable ultraviolet photodetector based on 2D c&#8208;MOF Cu3(HHTP)2/ZnO type&#8208;II heterojunction is fabricated by Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) deposition. At optimized MOF layer cycles, the photodetector shows superior photoresponse and outstanding mechanical durability.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) are a family of highly tunable and electrically conducting materials that can be utilized in optoelectronics. A major issue of 2D c&#8208;MOFs for photodetection is their poor charge separation and recombination dynamics upon illumination. This study demonstrates a Cu3(HHTP)2/ZnO type&#8208;II heterojunction ultraviolet (UV) photodetector fabricated by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) deposition, in which the charge separation of photogenerated carriers is enhanced. At optimized MOF layer cycles, the device achieves a responsivity of 78.2&#8197;A/W and detectivity of 3.8&#215;109 Jones at 1&#8197;V. Particularly, the device can be operated in the self&#8208;powered mode with an ultrafast response time of 70&#8197;&#956;s, which is the record value for MOF&#8208;based photodetectors. In addition, even after 1000&#8208;time bending of 180&#176;, the flexible device maintains stable performance. This flexible MOF&#8208;based UV photodetector with anti&#8208;fatigue and anti&#8208;bending properties provides strong implication to wearable optoelectronics.

         <title>Solvent&#8208; and Substrate&#8208;Induced Chiroptical Inversion in Amphiphilic, Biocompatible Glycoconjugate Supramolecules: Shape&#8208;Persistent Gelation, Self&#8208;Healing, and Antibacterial Activity</title>

Sometimes things just gel: Glycoconjugate (Z)&#8208;F&#8208;gluco in which a d&#8208;glucosamine moiety was attached to Cbz&#8208;protected l&#8208;phenylalanine at the C&#8197;terminus showed hierarchical self&#8208;aggregation leading to the formation of transparent, injectable, and biocompatible hydrogel. (Z)&#8208;F&#8208;Gluco nanocomposite hydrogel bearing AgNPs can be applied topically as an antibacterial soft material. Solvent&#8208;dependent chiral inversion was demonstrated in the aggregates of a (Z)&#8208;L&#8208;gluco&#8208;bearing l&#8208;leucine unit.







Abstract
We have shown solvent&#8208; and substrate&#8208;dependent chiral inversion of a few glycoconjugate supramolecules. (Z)&#8208;F&#8208;Gluco, in which d&#8208;glucosamine has been attached chemically to Cbz&#8208;protected l&#8208;phenylalanine at the C&#8197;terminus, forms a self&#8208;healing hydrogel through intertwining of the nanofibers wherein the gelators undergo lamellar packing in the &#946;&#8208;sheet secondary structures with a single chiral handedness. Dihybrid (Z)&#8208;F&#8208;gluco nanocomposite gel was prepared by in&#8208;situ formation of silver nanoparticles AgNPs in the gel; this enhances the mechanical properties of the composite gel through physical crosslinking without altering the packing pattern. In contrast, (Z)&#8208;L&#8208;gluco bearing an l&#8208;leucine moiety does not form a hydrogel but an organogel. Interestingly, the chiral handedness of the aggregates of (Z)&#8208;L&#8208;gluco can be reversed by choosing suitable solvents. In addition to self&#8208;healing behavior, (Z)&#8208;L&#8208;gluco gel revealed shape persistency. Further, (Z)&#8208;F&#8208;gluco hydrogel is benign, nontoxic, non&#8208;immunogenic, and non&#8208;allergenic in animal cells. AgNP&#8208;loaded (Z)&#8208;F&#8208;gluco hydrogel showed antibacterial activity against both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria.

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Assisted Coupling Reactions of Dinitrogen and Carbon Dioxide Mediated by Monometallic YB1&#8211;4&#8722;&#8901;Anions: Carbon&#8722;Nitrogen Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The monometallic YB1&#8211;4&#8722; anions mediated C&#8722;N coupling reactions with inert N2 and CO2 under plasma conditions have been reported. Anionic products NCNBO&#8722; and N(BO)2&#8722; were generated, accompanied by the production of neutral products of YO and YB0&#8211;2NC. This strategy may provide a new approach to realize the N2 and CO2 coupling reactions at room temperature.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed coupling to form C&#8722;N bonds is significant in chemical science. However, the inert nature of N2 and CO2 renders their coupling quite challenging. Herein, we report the activation of dinitrogen in the mild plasma atmosphere by the gas&#8208;phase monometallic YB1&#8211;4&#8722; anions and further coupling of CO2 to form C&#8722;N bonds by using mass spectrometry and theoretical calculation. The observed product anions are NCNBO&#8722; and N(BO)2&#8722;, accompanied by the formation of neutral products YO and YB0&#8211;2NC, respectively. We can tune the reactivity and the type of products by manipulating the number of B atoms. The B atoms in YB1&#8211;4N2&#8722; act as electron donors in CO2 reduction reactions, and the carbon atom originating from CO2 serves as an electron reservoir. This is the first example of gas&#8208;phase monometallic anions, which are capable to realize the functionalization of N2 with CO2 through C&#8722;N bond formation and N&#8722;N and C&#8722;O bond cleavage.

         <title>The Unprecedented [S4N2O10]2&#8722; Anion in the Molecular Gold Complexes [Au2Br2(S4N2O10)2] and [Au2Cl2(S4N2O10)2](S2O5Cl2)</title>

         <dc:description>
The cyclic anionic tetramer, [S4N2O10]2&#8722;, is reported in dimeric gold complexes for the first time. The anion can be interpreted as the condensation product of two sulfate anions and two amidosulfate anions. The applied solvothermal synthesis between SO3, P3N3Cl6 and metal salts is a promising route to obtain novel nitrogen&#8208;containing sulfates.







Abstract
The reaction of hexachlorophosphazene, P3N3Cl6, with SO3 and the gold halides AuCl3 and AuBr3, respectively, leads to the new cyclic anionic tetramer, [S4N2O10]2&#8722;, which is coordinated to Au3+ in the dimeric complexes [Au2X2(S4N2O10)2] (X=Cl, Br). The [S4N2O10]2&#8722; anion can be seen as the condensation product of two sulfate anions, [SO4]2&#8722;, and two amidosulfate anions, [NH2SO3]&#8722;.

         <title>Microscopic Reactivity of Phenylferrate Ions toward Organyl Halides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The gas&#8208;phase reactivity of phenylferrate ions toward organyl halides is studied by a combination of tandem mass spectrometry and DFT calculations. The thus obtained results offer a sharp glimpse at the elementary step of the oxidative addition and help to improve our fundamental understanding of iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions.







Abstract
Despite its practical importance, organoiron chemistry remains poorly understood due to its mechanistic complexity. Here, we focus on the oxidative addition of organyl halides to phenylferrate anions in the gas phase. By mass&#8208;selecting individual phenylferrate anions, we can determine the effect of the oxidation state, the ligation, and the nuclearity of the iron complex on its reactions with a series of organyl halides RX. We find that Ph2Fe(I)&#8722; and other low&#8208;valent ferrates are more reactive than Ph3Fe(II)&#8722;; Ph4Fe(III)&#8722; is inert. The coordination of a PPh3 ligand or the presence of a second iron center lower the reactivity. Besides direct cross&#8208;coupling reactions resulting in the formation of RPh, we also observe the abstraction of halogen atoms. This reaction channel shows the readiness of organoiron species to undergo radical&#8208;type processes. Complementary DFT calculations afford further insight and rationalize the high reactivity of the Ph2Fe(I)&#8722; complex by the exothermicity of the oxidative addition and the low barriers associated with this reaction step. At the same time, they point to the importance of changes of the spin state in the reactions of Ph3Fe(II)&#8722;.

         <title>Polymerization, Stimuli&#8208;induced Depolymerization, and Precipitation&#8208;driven Macrocyclization in a Nitroaldol Reaction System
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic covalent nitroaldol polymers of different topology is presented. Linear dynamers were generally produced, from which specific macrocycles were formed through depolymerization, driven by precipitation. The dynamers showed a clear adaptive behavior, displaying depolymerization and rearrangement of the dynamer chains in response to alternative building blocks as external stimuli.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent polymers of different topology have been synthesized from an aromatic dialdehyde and &#945;,&#969;&#8208;dinitroalkanes via the nitroaldol reaction. All dinitroalkanes yielded dynamers with the dialdehyde, where the length of the dinitroalkane chain played a vital role in determining the structure of the final products. For longer dinitroalkanes, linear dynamers were produced, where the degree of polymerization reached a plateau at higher feed concentrations. In the reactions involving 1,4&#8208;dinitrobutane and 1,5&#8208;dinitropentane, specific macrocycles were formed through depolymerization of the linear chains, further driven by precipitation. At lower temperature, the same systemic self&#8208;sorting effect was also observed for the 1,6&#8208;dinitrohexane&#8208;based dynamers. Moreover, the dynamers showed a clear adaptive behavior, displaying depolymerization and rearrangement of the dynamer chains in response to alternative building blocks as external stimuli.

         <dc:description>
Recently developed fast cysteine bioconjugation reactions are summarized in this Concept, with a focus on the mechanisms and design principles that underlie the high efficiency of the new cysteine&#8208;modifying reagents.







Abstract
Cysteine bioconjugation serves as a powerful tool in biological research and has been widely used for chemical modification of proteins, constructing antibody&#8208;drug conjugates, and enabling cell imaging studies. Cysteine conjugation reactions with fast kinetics and exquisite selectivity have been under heavy pursuit as they would allow clean protein modification with just stoichiometric amounts of reagents, which minimizes side reactions, simplifies purification and broadens functional group tolerance. In this concept, we summarize the recent advances in fast cysteine bioconjugation, and discuss the mechanism and chemical principles that underlie the high efficiencies of the newly developed cysteine reactive reagents.

         <title>Intrinsic Regularity of Catalytic Cobalt Chalcogenides in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Battery: Theoretical Study Delivers New Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Theoretical study delivers new insights into catalytic cobalt chalcogenides CoX2 (X=S, Se, Te) in lithium&#8208;sulfur battery. The polysulfides adsorption is mainly controled by relative vertical distance of two X atomic layers (rather than atom electronegativity). The charging process (rather than discharging process) is mainly regulated to contribute to steady polysulfides conversion.







Abstract
Cobalt chalcogenides CoX2 (X=S, Se, Te) render great performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries based on catalytic capacity to alleviate shuttle effect. Given that S/Se/Te belong to the same main group, the outstanding cycling stability delivered by CoTe2 aroused the curiosity about the uniqueness of CoTe2 and intrinsic laws of cobalt chalcogenide. Herein, comprehensive theoretical study delivers new insights into the intrinsic laws of CoX2: the relative vertical distance of two X atomic layers (rather than atom electronegativity) mainly controls adsorption; CoX2 mainly regulates the charging process (rather than discharging process) thus contributes to great cycling stability. On this basis, the advantages of CoTe2 are three&#8208;fold: moderate polysulfide adsorption, facile ion transport capacity, and surprisingly great promotion of charging process. It is hope the results will facilitate the development of cobalt chalcogenides, especially tellurides as catalytic material in lithium sulfur batteries.

         <title>Thiazole Boron Difluoride Dyes with Large Stokes Shift, Solid State Emission and Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Five&#8208;membered boron difluoro complexes using a secondary amide as an anionic ligand display large Stokes shift and significant solid&#8208;state emission. Dyes exhibiting room&#8208; temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emission in both amorphous and crystalline states are documented.







Abstract
The small Stokes shift and weak emission in the solid state are two main shortcomings associated with the boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) family of dyes. This study presents the design, synthesis and luminescent properties of boron difluoro complexes of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;5&#8208;alkylamino&#8208;4&#8208;alkylaminocarbonylthiazoles. These dyes display Stokes shifts (&#916;&#955;, 77&#8211;101&#8197;nm) with quantum yields (&#981;FL) up to 64.9 and 34.7&#8201;% in toluene solution and in solid state, respectively. Some of these compounds exhibit dual fluorescence and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emission properties with modulable phosphorescence quantum yields (&#981;PL) and lifetime (&#964;p up to 251&#8197;&#956;s). The presence of intramolecular H&#8208;bonds and negligible &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking revealed by X&#8208;ray crystal structure might account for the observed large Stokes shift and significant solid&#8208;state emission of these fluorophores, while the enhanced spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) of iodine and the self&#8208;assembly driven by halogen bonding, &#960;&#8208;&#960; and C&#8722;H&#8230;&#960; interactions could be responsible for the observed RTP of iodine containing phosphors.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of 3&#8208;Aryl Substituted Isocoumarins and Phthalides through Palladium Acetate Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H Activation in Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, high&#8208;throughput synthesis of isocoumarins and phthalides is presented. The reaction is carried out in molten tetrabutylammonium acetate (ionic liquid) which allows the use of an amount of palladium acetate from ten to twenty times lower than that of similar protocols in molecular solvents (0.5&#8201;% mol). Oxygen is used as a reoxidant for the metal, mediated by copper acetate.







Abstract
A novel Pd&#8208;catalysed oxidative coupling between benzoic acids and vinylarenes or acrylates to furnish isocoumarins and phthalides is reported. The reaction proceeds smoothly in molten tetrabutylammonium acetate via a selective C&#8722;H bond activation, with very low percentage of ligand&#8208;free palladium acetate as the catalyst, under atmospheric pressure of oxygen. Sub&#8208;stoichiometric amount of copper acetate is also required as a reoxidant for the palladium.

         <title>Mitochondrial Targeting and Imaging with Small Organic Conjugated Fluorophores: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The last decade has seen an increasingly large number of studies reporting on the development of novel small organic conjugated systems for mitochondrial imaging exploiting optical signal transduction pathways. Mitochondria are known to play a critical role in a number of key biological processes, including cellular metabolism. Importantly, irregularities on their working function are nowadays understood to be intimately linked to a range of clinical conditions, highlighting the importance of targeting mitochondria for therapeutic benefits. In this work we carry out an in&#8208;depth evaluation on the progress to date in the field to pave the way for the realization of superior alternatives to those currently existing. The manuscript is structured by commonly used chemical scaffolds and comprehensively covers key aspects factored in design strategies such as synthetic approaches as well as photophysical and biological characterization, to foster collaborative work among organic and physical chemists as well as cell biologists.</dc:description>

The possible tuning of the Ge(II)&#8594;B interaction was proved experimentally, yielding compounds 1&#8208;PPh  2  &#8208;8&#8208;(LGe)&#8208;C  10  H  6  (  4  ) and L(Cl)Ge&#183;GaCl  3  (  5  ) without a Ge(II)&#8594;B interaction. In  5,  an unprecedented Ge(II)&#8594;Ga coordination was revealed. The experimental results are complemented with a theoretical study focusing on the bonding in  1  &#8208;  5  . The different strength of the Ge(II)&#8594;E (E = B, Ga) donation was evaluated using energy decomposition analysis (EDA).

         <title>Electro&#8208;assisted Molecular Assembly Endowing the Atomic&#8208;Scaled Catalytic Active Site Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The artificially accurate design of the none&#8208;metal electrocatalyst&#8217;s active site has been a huge challenge since the pure active species with the specific structure could not be strictly controlled by the traditional synthetic methods. The species with the multi configuration in the catalyst hinder the active site identification and the subsequent comprehension of the reaction mechanism. Here, we developed a novel electro&#8208;assisted molecular assembly strategy to obtain the pure pentagon ring on the perfect graphene avoiding other reconstructed structures. More importantly, the active atom was confirmed as the topmost sited carbon atom by the subtle passivation process. The reaction mechanism recognition of carbon defect for electrocatalysis is firstly downsized to the single atom scale from the experimental perspective. This innovated electro&#8208;assisted molecular assembly strategy is expected to be extensively applied in the active structure&#8208;controlled synthesis of none&#8208;metal electrocatalysts and the verification of the exact active atom.</dc:description>

         <title>Correct identification of the core&#8208;shell structure of cell membrane&#8208;coated polymeric nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations of negatively stained cell membrane (CM)&#8208;coated polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) reveal a characteristic core&#8208;shell structure. However, negative staining agents can create artifacts that complicate the determination of the actual NP structure. Herein, we demonstrate with various bare polymeric core NPs, such as poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA), poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether&#8208;block&#8208;PLGA, and poly(caprolactone), that certain observed core&#8208;shell structures are actually artifacts caused by the staining process. To address this issue, we use fluorescence quenching to quantify the proportion of fully coated NPs and use statistical TEM analysis to identify and differentiate whether the observed core&#8208;shell structures of CM&#8208;coated PLGA (CM&#8208;PLGA) NPs are due to artifacts or to the CM coating. Integrated shells in TEM images of negatively stained CM&#8208;PLGA NPs are identified as artifacts. The present results challenge current understanding of the structure of CM&#8208;coated polymeric NPs and encourage researchers should use the proposed characterization approach to avoid misinterpretations.</dc:description>

The present results challenge current understanding of the structure of CM-coated polymeric NPs and encourage researchers should use the proposed characterization approach to avoid misinterpretations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>New Strategy for Optimizing the Properties of Copper Halide Organic&#8208;inorganic Hybrid Lighting&#8208;emitting Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper(I) halide organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid luminescent materials have many advantages, such as diverse structure, facile synthesis, high luminescent efficiency, tunable optical performance, etc., and show a broad application prospect in energy&#8208;saving lighting display and other fields. However, compared with commercial rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal&#8208;based phosphors, the reported hybrids generally suffer from poor stability and low luminescent efficiency, which are the bottleneck problem of their practical application. With the aim of developing high&#8208;performance organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid luminescent materials, a new synthesis strategy has been reported. This strategy can systematically design and synthesis copper(I) halide ionic hybrid structures by combining the covalent bonding and ionic bonding between inorganic and organic components into one structure, and use their synergistic effect to optimizing their properties. This design method is expected to develop high&#8208;performance organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid luminescent materials, promote the in&#8208;depth understanding of this field, and provide new ideas for the optimization of other types of hybrid materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Effective Iodine Capture Behavior by a Censer&#8208;shaped Macrocycle in Vapor Phase and Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iodine capture is of great significance for disposal of the hazardous radioactive iodine. CTX[P(O)Ph], one kind of censer&#8208;shaped macrocycle cyclotrixylohydroquinoylene (CTX) derivatives, was applied as an efficient iodine adsorbent. It showed satisfactory iodine adsorption capacity in vapor phase and could be reused without obvious adsorption capacity loss. Besides, the adsorbent could also uptake iodine in water. Fortunately, two iodine loading CTX[P(O)Ph] crystal structures were obtained under different conditions to explore the mechanism of iodine adsorption. This work provided a relatively rare example of iodine adsorption by macrocycle. It is promising that the results with crystal information might be meaningful for exploring and designing new kinds of iodine adsorbents.</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial Antiferromagnets Possessing Extended Zero&#8208;, One&#8208;, Two&#8208;, and Three&#8208;Dimensional Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 52, September 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antiferromagnetic coupling of ferro&#8208; or ferrimagnetically ordered isolated ions (0D), extended chain (1D), layer (2D), or 3D&#8208;network structures can lead to antiferromagnetically ordered materials, which are referred to as artificial (or synthetic) antiferromagnets.







Abstract
Layered (2D) artificial (or synthetic) antiferromagnets are fabricated by atom deposition techniques and possess very thin, nanometer&#8208;scale, magnetically ordered layers separated by a very thin nonmagnetic layer that antiferromagnetically couples the magnetic layers. Artificial antiferromagnets were crucial in the discovery of the giant magnetic effect (GMR), which had an incredible impact on the evolution of computer memory and its applications, and nucleated the dawn of spintronics (magnetoelectrics). The fundamental structural motif has been more recently achieved by using synthetic chemical methods that led to insulating artificial antiferromagnets. Examples of magnetically ordered layers that are antiferromagnetic coupled to form artificial antiferromagnets have been extended to isolated ions (0D) as well as extended chain (1D) and extended network 3D structures, and new phenomena and applications are anticipated as insulating antiferromagnets are more effective at propagating spin currents with respect to dielectric materials.

Alkenyl cyclopropyl ketones tethered to (hetero)arenes readily underwent catalytic, intramolecular interrupted homo&#8208;Nazarov cascade biscyclizations to form 6,6,6&#8208;, 6,5,6&#8208;, 6,6,5&#8208;, 6,6,6,5&#8208;, and 6,6,5,6&#8208;fused angular architectures. The approach was used for the concise total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;1&#8208;oxoferruginol, a bioactive abietane diterpenoid.







Abstract
Herein, a SnCl4&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular, interrupted homo&#8208;Nazarov cascade biscyclization to access angular (hetero)aryl&#8208;fused polycycles is reported. Subsequent decarboxylation of the readily enolizable products afforded the angular products in up to 71&#8201;% yield over two steps, with the trans&#8208;diastereomers as the major products. The cyclopropyl homo&#8208;Nazarov cyclization precursors were formed using a scalable and modular synthetic route that, ultimately, offers access to 6,6,6&#8208;, 6,6,5&#8208;, 6,5,6&#8208;, 6,6,5,6&#8208;, and 6,6,6,5&#8208;fused angular polycyclic products. To showcase the rigor and utility of the method, an 8&#8208;step total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;1&#8208;oxoferruginol, an antibacterial aromatic abietane diterpenoid, was disclosed.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Induced Structural Change in Artificial Heterometallic&#8208;Oxide Cluster Mimicking the Photosynthetic Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Center</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 52, September 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To understand the chemical principle of the photosynthetic oxygen&#8208;evolving center (OEC), we report two (Mn3XO4)2O&#8208;clusters (X=Sr2+, La3+) closely mimicking both the heterometallic&#8208;oxide cubane and all types of oxide bridges in OEC. Structural comparison of both oxidized and reduced forms of the (Mn3LaO4)2O&#8208;cluster indicates that the reactive site is the &#956;2&#8208;oxide bridge rather than the &#956;4&#8208;oxide or &#956;3&#8208;oxide bridges in the cluster.







Abstract
The oxygen&#8208;evolving center (OEC) in photosynthesis is a unique Mn4CaO5&#8208;cluster that catalyzes the water&#8208;splitting reaction in nature. Understanding its catalytic mechanism for the O=O bond formation is of great challenge and long&#8208;standing issue, which is severely restricted by the lack of precise structure and mechanism mimics of this heterometallic&#8208;oxide cluster. Herein, we report two synthetic (Mn3XO4)2O&#8208;clusters (X=Sr2+, La3+) that closely mimic the heterometallic&#8208;oxide Mn3XO4 cubane and three different types of &#956;&#8208;oxide bridges (&#956;2&#8208;O2&#8722;, &#956;3&#8208;O2&#8722;, and &#956;4&#8208;O2&#8722;) simultaneously as seen in the OEC. By resolving the crystal structures of both oxidized and reduced forms of the cluster, we have identified significant redox&#8208;induced structural changes that take place on the &#956;2&#8208;oxide bridge, rather than the &#956;4&#8208;oxide or &#956;3&#8208;oxide bridges. Our results provide chemical insights into understanding the reactivity of three different types of oxide bridges in the biological Mn4CaO5&#8208;cluster in PSII.

By resolving the crystal structures of both oxidized and reduced forms of the cluster, we have identified significant redox-induced structural changes that take place on the &#956;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-oxide bridge, rather than the &lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-oxide or &lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-oxide bridges. Our results provide chemical insights into understanding the reactivity of three different types of oxide bridges in the biological Mn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;CaO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-cluster in PSII.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cost&#8208;Effective 2D Ultrathin Metal&#8208;Organic Layers with Bis&#8208;Metallic Catalytic Sites for Visible Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 52, September 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work 2D ultrathin metal&#8208;organic layers (MOLs) with bis&#8208;metallic catalytic sites were developed to negate the blemish of low&#8208;density catalytic sites and low electron transmission efficiency on the surface of 3D MOFs, thus resulting in efficient and selective visible light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction by earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysis.







Abstract
As novel generated 2D materials, metal&#8208;organic layers (MOLs) have recently emerged as a potential platform for photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (PCO2RR). Such 2D structures negate the blemish of low&#8208;density catalytic sites and low electron transmission efficiency on the surface of metal organic frameworks (MOFs), while retaining the advantage of low expenditure when using earth&#8208;abundant metal nodes and meritorious applicability in the PCO2RR. Herein, it is reported that the 2D ultrathin layer material with bis&#8208;metallic catalytic sites (Ni&#8722;O metal node and the Ni&#8722;N metal site) from bidentate ligand 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;5,5&#8217;&#8208;dicarboxylate (H2bpydc) and nickel(II) remarkably boosts the visible light&#8208;driven PCO2RR performance with a CO yield of 2400&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 for 18&#8197;h and a selectivity up to 99&#8201;%. Consequently, the effects of morphology, catalytic sites and intrinsic properties on PCO2RR efficiency have been investigated in detail. In this context, the ultrathin layer structure has been elucidated as the key point to facilitate electron transfer efficiency. Notably, the bis&#8208;metallic catalytic sites with reasonable distance between two adjacent metals presumably induce synergistic effect and offer a guiding ideology for further designing high performance photocatalysts.

         <title>Photocatalytic E&#8594;Z Contra&#8208;Thermodynamic Isomerization of Vinyl Silanes with Lewis Base</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 52, September 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The contra&#8208;thermodynamic E&#8594;Z isomerization of vinyl silanes was reported using rac&#8208;BINAP as the photocatalyst. This reaction proceeds via the in situ formation of a chromophoric species, in the presence of catalyst. Under irradiation at 405&#8197;nm the interconversion of E&#8208;isomers into the Z&#8208;congeners were carried out in good to excellent yields and outstanding Z/E selectivities (18 examples) and the reaction mechanism was studied.







Abstract
Herein, we disclosed the contra&#8208;thermodynamic E&#8594;Z isomerization of alkenyl silanes, according to the in situ formation of a chromophoric species, in the presence of rac&#8208;BINAP as the catalyst. The reaction carried out in DMSO or CH3CN under irradiation at 405&#8197;nm allowed the interconversion of the E&#8208;isomers into the Z&#8208;congeners in good to excellent yields and outstanding Z/E selectivities, on 18 examples. Finally, the mechanism of this E&#8594;Z isomerization was studied to get insight into the reaction mechanism.

Tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;trioxophenalenyl neutral diradical undergoes a &#963;&#8208;dimerization, generating two types of &#963;&#8208;dimers immediately after the preparation. One of the &#963;&#8208;dimers is a close&#8208;shell dimer linked through double&#8208;&#963;&#8208;bonds, and the other one is a peroxy&#8208;linked open&#8208;shell dimer. These &#963;&#8208;dimers are in equilibrium in the solution state by the reversible &#963;&#8208;bond formation/cleavage via the neutral diradical as a key intermediate.







Abstract
A novel neutral diradical of &#960;&#8208;extended phenalenyl derivative having three oxo&#8208;groups, tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;trioxophenalenyl, and two types of the corresponding &#963;&#8208;dimers were investigated. Quantum chemical calculations showed that the neutral diradical is in triplet ground state having doubly degenerate singly occupied molecular orbitals. The neutral diradical undergoes a &#963;&#8208;dimerization, generating two types of &#963;&#8208;dimers immediately after the preparation. One of the &#963;&#8208;dimers, which was selectively generated in the crystalline state, was a close&#8208;shell dimer linked through double&#8208;&#963;&#8208;bonds on the phenalenyl skeleton with a long C&#8722;C bond length of 1.66&#8197;&#197;. The other &#963;&#8208;dimer, which existed only in the solution state, was a peroxy&#8208;linked open&#8208;shell dimer in which one &#963;&#8208;bond was formed between two oxygen atoms. Furthermore, the temperature&#8208;dependent 1H&#8197;NMR and ESR spectra revealed that these &#963;&#8208;dimers are in equilibrium in the solution state by the reversible &#963;&#8208;bond formation/cleavage via the neutral diradical as a key intermediate.

         <title>Modeling Heme Peroxidase: Heme Saddling Facilitates Reactions with Hyperperoxides To Form High&#8208;Valent FeIV&#8208;Oxo Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 52, September 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The saddling structure of the porphyrin ring can not only promote the coordination of the ROOH to the iron center but also give a significant push effect to facilitate the homolysis of the O&#8722;O bond of FeIII&#8208;OOR complexes into high&#8208;valent iron(IV)oxo compounds. The deformation&#8208;induced electronic effect provides heme&#8208;containing peroxidases with another potential mechanism for the O&#8722;O bond cleavage of FeIIIOOH to form high&#8208;valent iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species.







Abstract
Saddle&#8208;shaped hemes have been discovered in the structures of most peroxidases. How such a macrocycle deformation affects the reaction of FeIII hemes with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to form high&#8208;valent Fe&#8208;oxo species remains uncertain. Through examination of the ESI&#8208;MS spectra, absorption changes and 1H NMR chemical shifts, we investigated the reactions of two FeIII porphyrins with different degrees of saddling deformation, namely FeIII(OETPP)ClO4 (1OE) and FeIII(OMTPP)ClO4 (1OM), with tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide (tBuOOH) in CH2Cl2 at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, which quickly resulted in O&#8722;O bond homolysis from a highly unstable FeIII&#8208;alkylperoxo intermediate, FeIII&#8208;O(H)OR (2) into FeIV&#8208;oxo porphyrins (3). Insight into the reaction mechanism was obtained from [tBuOOH]&#8208;dependent kinetics. At &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, the reaction of 1OE with tBuOOH exhibited an equilibrium constant (Ka=362.3&#8197;M&#8722;1) and rate constant (k=1.87&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;sM&#8722;&gt;1) for the homolytic cleavage of the 2 O&#8722;O bond that were 2.1 and 1.4 times higher, respectively, than those exhibited by 1OM (Ka=171.8&#8197;M&#8722;1 and k=1.36&#215;10&#8722;2&#8201;&#8201;s&#8722;1). DFT calculations indicated that an FeIII porphyrin with greater saddling deformation can achieve a higher HOMO ([Fe(d
,d
)&#8208;porphyrin(a2u)]) to strengthen the orbital interaction with the LUMO (O&#8722;O bond &#963;*) to facilitate O&#8722;O cleavage.

The deformation-induced electronic effect provides heme-containing peroxidases with another potential mechanism for the O&#8722;O bond cleavage of Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;OOH to form high-valent iron(IV)-oxo species.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saddle-shaped hemes have been discovered in the structures of most peroxidases. How such a macrocycle deformation affects the reaction of Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; hemes with hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to form high-valent Fe-oxo species remains uncertain. Through examination of the ESI-MS spectra, absorption changes and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR chemical shifts, we investigated the reactions of two Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; porphyrins with different degrees of saddling deformation, namely Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(OETPP)ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;OE&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) and Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(OMTPP)ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;OM&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;), with &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl hydroperoxide (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuOOH) in CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, which quickly resulted in O&#8722;O bond homolysis from a highly unstable Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-alkylperoxo intermediate, Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-O(H)OR (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) into Fe&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;-oxo porphyrins (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;). Insight into the reaction mechanism was obtained from [&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuOOH]-dependent kinetics. At &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, the reaction of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;OE&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; with &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuOOH exhibited an equilibrium constant (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;=362.3&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and rate constant (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;=1.87&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;M&#8722;&amp;gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) for the homolytic cleavage of the &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; O&#8722;O bond that were 2.1 and 1.4 times higher, respectively, than those exhibited by &lt;b&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;OM&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;=171.8&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;=1.36&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). DFT calculations indicated that an Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; porphyrin with greater saddling deformation can achieve a higher HOMO ([Fe(d
,d
)-porphyrin(a&lt;sub&gt;2u&lt;/sub&gt;)]) to strengthen the orbital interaction with the LUMO (O&#8722;O bond &#963;*) to facilitate O&#8722;O cleavage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Engineering of Conjugated Polybenzothiadiazoles and Integration with Cobalt Oxides for Photocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 52, September 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated polybenzothiadiazoles thermally treated by a hydrolysis process present high hydrophilicity and low water absorption energy, which enable excellent photocatalytic water oxidation performance and stability.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers feature promising structure and properties for photocatalytic water splitting. Herein, a hydrolysis strategy was demonstrated to rationally modulate the surface hydrophilicity and band structures of conjugated poly&#8208;benzothiadiazoles. High hydrophilicity not only enhances the dispersions of polymeric solids in an aqueous solution but also reduces the absorption energy of water molecules. Besides, both theoretical and experimental results reveal that a more positive valence band potential is generated, which contributes to enhancing the photocatalytic water oxidation performance. Accordingly, the surface&#8208;modified conjugated polymers show largely promoted photocatalytic water oxidation activities by deposition of cobalt oxides as cocatalysts.

         <title>Chemoselective Acylation of Nucleosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 52, September 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoselective functionalization of oxygen atoms versus nitrogen atoms in bifunctional and polyfunctional molecules is a long&#8208;standing challenge in both fundamental chemistry and in complex molecule synthesis. Different conditions that allow high selectivity in the derivatization of complex nucleosides that contain both O&#8208; and N&#8208;based functionalities are described. Particularly intriguing cases are also presented, in which the reactivity of the O&#8208; and N&#8208;based functionalities is quite context dependent, exhibiting reactivity that blurs conventional considerations, yet where selectivity may also be observed.







Abstract
Acylated nucleoside analogues play an important role in medicinal chemistry and are extremely useful precursors to various other nucleoside analogues. However, chemoselective acylation of nucleosides usually requires several protection and deprotection steps due to the competing nucleophilicity of hydroxy and amino groups. In contrast, direct protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free chemoselective acylation of nucleosides is a preferred strategy due to lower cost and fewer overall synthetic steps. Herein, a simple and efficient chemoselective acylation of nucleosides and nucleotides under mild reaction conditions, giving either O&#8208; or N&#8208;acylated products respectively with excellent chemoselectivity is reported.

         <title>A Coordination Network Featuring Two Distinct Copper(II) Coordination Environments for Highly Selective Acetylene Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 52, September 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D coordination network was synthesised from commercial reagents and displays two distinct coordination environments of copper to carboxylate and salicylaldehydato moieties of the ligand. Solvent exchange of the synthesized network shows retention of framework connectivity coupled with unanticipated framework flexibility to accommodate tetrahydrofuran. The activated framework selectively adsorbs CO2 and C2Hn hydrocarbons over CH4.







Abstract
Single crystals of 2D coordination network {Cu2L2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(DMF)3(H2O)3}n (1&#8208;DMF) were prepared by reaction of commercial reagents 3&#8208;formyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid (H2L) and Cu(NO3)2 in dimethylformamide (DMF). The single&#8208;crystal structure shows two distinct Cu(II) coordination environments arising from the separate coordination of Cu(II) cations to the carboxylate and salicylaldehydato moieties on the linker, with 1D channels running through the structure. Flexibility is exhibited on solvent exchange with ethanol and tetrahydrofuran, while porosity and the unique overall connectivity of the structure are retained. The activated material exhibits type I gas sorption behaviour and a BET surface area of 950&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 (N2, 77&#8197;K). Notably, the framework adsorbs negligible quantities of CH4 compared with CO2 and the C2Hn hydrocarbons. It exhibits exceptional selectivity for C2H2/CH4 and C2H2/C2Hn, which has applicability in separation technologies for the isolation of C2H2.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated Directional Capping of Rod&#8208;Packing Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 52, September 16, 2022. </description>

Based on structural analysis of newly synthesized 3D rod&#8208;packing manganese&#8208;based framework, strategic design of capping agent was developed to obtain a 2D rod&#8208;packing framework. SQUID measurements and DFT calculations proved ferrimagnetic ordering of the material below 8&#8197;K, further illustrating the potential of developing spintronic materials through 2D rod&#8208;packing MOFs







Abstract
Two new rod&#8208;packing metal&#8211;organic frameworks (RPMOF) are constructed by regulating the in situ formation of the capping agent. In CPM&#8208;s7, carboxylate linkers extend 1D manganese&#8208;oxide chains in four additional directions, forming 3D RPMOF. The substitution of Mn2+ with a stronger Lewis acidic Co2+, leads to an acceleration of the hydrolysis&#8208;prone sulfonate linker, resulting in presence of sulfate ions to reduce two out of the four carboxylate&#8208;extending directions, and thus forming a new 2D rod&#8208;packing CPM&#8208;s8. Density functional theory calculations and magnetization measurements reveal ferrimagnetic ordering of CPM&#8208;s8, signifying the potential of exploring 2D RPMOF for effective low&#8208;dimensional magnetic materials.

The substitution of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; with a stronger Lewis acidic Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, leads to an acceleration of the hydrolysis-prone sulfonate linker, resulting in presence of sulfate ions to reduce two out of the four carboxylate-extending directions, and thus forming a new 2D rod-packing CPM-s8. Density functional theory calculations and magnetization measurements reveal ferrimagnetic ordering of CPM-s8, signifying the potential of exploring 2D RPMOF for effective low-dimensional magnetic materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reactivity of Primary Phosphines and Primary Phosphine Sulfides towards Imines</title>

To P(III) or not to P(III). A three&#8208;component mixture containing primary phosphine, chalcogen, and an imine affords a bis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminophosphine chalcogenide. Mechanistic studies show an interesting dichotomy between the relative reactivities of P(III) vs. P(V) species towards imines.







Abstract
Reactivity of primary phosphines with two stoichiometric equivalents of imine results in the formation of bis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminophosphines (2&#8201;a&#8211;e), which can be subsequently oxidized in the presence of S8 or H2O2 to generate air stable bis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminophosphine sulfides (2&#8201;b&#8211;m(S/O)). To elucidate the mechanism of this three&#8208;component reaction, Hammett analysis, kinetic isotope effect (KIE), and trapping experiments were performed. Ultimately a P(V)&#8211;P(III) tautomerization is invoked, followed by nucleophilic attack by the P(III) species to generate the desired products.

         <title>Flexible Alkylene Bridges as a Tool To Engineer Crystal Distyrylbenzene Structures Enabling Highly Fluorescent Monomeric Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 52, September 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing flexible alkylene bridges to distyrylbenzene can realize monomeric emission in the solid state without any requirement for bulky substituents and has many potential applications, diversifying crystal structure design and fabrication strategies.







Abstract
To design ultrabright fluorescent solid dyes, a crystal engineering strategy that enables monomeric emission by blocking intermolecular electronic interactions is required. We introduced propylene moieties to distyrylbenzene (DSB) as bridges between the phenyl rings either side of its C=C bonds. The bridged DSB derivatives formed compact crystals that emit colors similar to those of the same molecules in dilute solution, with high quantum yields. The introduction of flexible seven&#8208;membered rings to the DSB core produced moderate distortion and steric hindrance in the DSB &#960;&#8208;plane. However, owing to this strategy, it was possible to control the molecular arrangement with almost no decrease in the crystal density, and intermolecular electronic interactions were suppressed. The bridged DSB crystal structure differs from other DSB derivative structures; thus, bridging affords access to novel crystalline systems. This design strategy has important implications in many fields and is more effective than the conventional photofunctional molecular crystal design strategies.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Using A Molecular Antimony Complex under Aqueous Conditions: An Experimental and Computational Study on Main&#8208;Group Element Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 52, September 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An antimony complex was synthesized and heterogenized onto a carbon paper electrode surface. This system is capable of electrocatalytically evolving hydrogen gas under aqueous acidic conditions with high activity and efficiency. The stability of the heterogenized complex was confirmed by XPS of the used electrode surface and ICP&#8208;MS of the post catalysis electrolyte. Computational kinetic studies suggest that the generation of hydrogen&#8208;catalyst adduct is a rate&#8208;limiting step.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic hydrogen gas production is considered a potential pathway towards carbon&#8208;neutral energy sources. However, the development of this technology is hindered by the lack of efficient, cost&#8208;effective, and environmentally benign catalysts. In this study, a main&#8208;group&#8208;element&#8208;based electrocatalyst, SbSalen, is reported to catalyze the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an aqueous medium. The heterogenized molecular system achieved a Faradaic efficiency of 100&#8201;% at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V vs. NHE with a maximum current density of &#8722;30.7&#8197;mA/cm2. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy of the catalyst&#8208;bound working electrode before and after electrolysis confirmed the molecular stability during catalysis. The turnover frequency was calculated as 43.4&#8197;s&#8722;1 using redox&#8208;peak integration. The kinetic and mechanistic aspects of the electrocatalytic reaction were further examined by computational methods. This study provides mechanistic insights into main&#8208;group&#8208;element electrocatalysts for heterogeneous small&#8208;molecule conversion.

         <title>Direct C&#8722;H Trifluoromethylation of (Hetero)Arenes in Water Enabled by Organic Photoredox&#8208;Active Amphiphilic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 52, September 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoredox&#8208;catalyzed trifluoromethylations of a variety of small organic molecules were studied in water with the aid of amphiphilic polymeric nanoparticles. Excellent recyclability of the nanoparticles, high efficacy and selectivity, and the use of low intensity LED or sunlight render this method versatile and environmentally friendly.







Abstract
Photoredox&#8208;catalyzed chemical conversions are predominantly operated in organic media to ensure good compatibility between substrates and catalysts. Yet, when conducted in aqueous media, they are an attractive, mild, and green way to introduce functional groups into organic molecules. We here show that trifluoromethyl groups can be readily installed into a broad range of organic compounds by using water as the reaction medium and light as the energy source. To bypass solubility obstacles, we developed robust water&#8208;soluble polymeric nanoparticles that accommodate reagents and photocatalysts within their hydrophobic interior under high local concentrations. By taking advantage of the high excited state reduction potential of N&#8208;phenylphenothiazine (PTH) through UV light illumination, the direct C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of a wide array of small organic molecules is achieved selectively with high substrate conversion. Key to our approach is slowing down the production of CF3 radicals during the chemical process by reducing the catalyst loading as well as the light intensity, thereby improving effectiveness and selectivity of this aqueous photocatalytic method. Furthermore, the catalyst system shows excellent recyclability and can be fueled by sunlight. The method we propose here is versatile, widely applicable, energy efficient, and attractive for late&#8208;stage introduction of trifluoromethyl groups into biologically active molecules.

         <title>Online Reaction Monitoring with Fast and Flow&#8208;Compatible Diffusion NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 52, September 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a fast and flow compatible diffusion NMR experiment, that makes it possible to collect accurate diffusion data for samples flowing at up to 3&#8197;mL/min. We use it to monitor the synthesis of a Schiff base with a flow&#8208;tube with a time resolution of approximately 2&#8197;minutes. The one&#8208;shot flow&#8208;compatible diffusion NMR described here open many avenues for reaction monitoring applications.







Abstract
Online monitoring by flow NMR spectroscopy is a powerful approach to study chemical reactions and processes, which can provide mechanistic understanding, and drive optimisations. However, some of the most useful methods for mixture analysis and reaction monitoring are not directly applicable in flow conditions. This is the case of classic diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) methods, which can be used to separate the spectral information for mixture's components. We describe a fast and flow&#8208;compatible diffusion NMR experiment that makes it possible to collect accurate diffusion data for samples flowing at up to 3&#8197;mL/min. We use it to monitor the synthesis of a Schiff base with a flow&#8208;tube with a time resolution of approximately 2&#8197;minutes. The one&#8208;shot flow&#8208;compatible diffusion NMR described here open many avenues for reaction monitoring applications.

     alt="Online Reaction Monitoring with Fast and Flow-Compatible Diffusion NMR Spectroscopy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We describe a fast&lt;/b&gt; and flow compatible diffusion NMR experiment, that makes it possible to collect accurate diffusion data for samples flowing at up to 3&#8197;mL/min. We use it to monitor the synthesis of a Schiff base with a flow-tube with a time resolution of approximately 2&#8197;minutes. The one-shot flow-compatible diffusion NMR described here open many avenues for reaction monitoring applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online monitoring by flow NMR spectroscopy is a powerful approach to study chemical reactions and processes, which can provide mechanistic understanding, and drive optimisations. However, some of the most useful methods for mixture analysis and reaction monitoring are not directly applicable in flow conditions. This is the case of classic diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) methods, which can be used to separate the spectral information for mixture's components. We describe a fast and flow-compatible diffusion NMR experiment that makes it possible to collect accurate diffusion data for samples flowing at up to 3&#8197;mL/min. We use it to monitor the synthesis of a Schiff base with a flow-tube with a time resolution of approximately 2&#8197;minutes. The one-shot flow-compatible diffusion NMR described here open many avenues for reaction monitoring applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cover Feature: Flexible Alkylene Bridges as a Tool To Engineer Crystal Distyrylbenzene Structures Enabling Highly Fluorescent Monomeric Emission (Chem. Eur. J. 52/2022)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 52, September 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a new crystal engineering tool, we prepared organic solid&#8208;state light&#8208;emitting materials that exhibit very bright monomeric emissions. Introducing flexible alkylene bridges into distyrylbenzene (blue fluorescent dye) generated the desired crystal structure in which each dye is isolated in a compact space. More information can be found in the Research Article by G.&#8208;i. Konishi and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201884).

2D ultrathin metal&#8211;organic layers (MOLs) with bis&#8208;metallic sites have been developed for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction. The expanded checkerboard represents the 2D MOL structure. The two differently colored pawns represent bis&#8208;metallic sites, the cream one being responsible for transferring electrons to CO2, and the cyan one denoting protons coupling with CO2. The ingenious layout makes them work synergistically resulting in a magical effect that is crucial for efficient CO2 photoreduction to CO.

Transition metal (TM) layered oxides with rigid frameworks and two&#8208;dimensional ion diffusion pathways have been extensively studied in potassium&#8208;ion batteries. To improve their potassium storage properties, a series of crystal tuning strategies have been developed, including TM layer regulation, potassium and oxygen layers regulation, construction of hierarchical structure, air&#8208;stabilized TM layered oxides.







Abstract
Layered oxide cathodes have demonstrated great potential for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) on account of high reversible capacity, appropriate diffusion paths, and low cost. However, their electrochemical performance in PIBs is generally worse than that in lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to large structural changes and deformations during charging and discharging. To improve their potassium storage performance, a series of strategies have been developed in recent studies. In this review, we summarize the latest advancements in layered oxide cathodes for PIBs through different crystal regulation strategies, including transition metal layer doping, potassium content optimization, oxygen partial substitution, functional morphology construction and air stability improvement. Meanwhile, the relationship between the electrochemical properties and structural evolution of these modified cathodes is also investigated. In addition, the challenges and prospects of these layered oxide cathodes in PIBs are analyzed in detail, providing constructive insights for future applications of PIBs.

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;&lt;i&gt;With reasonable distance between adjacent two metals, the bis-metallic catalytic sites presumably induce synergistic effects, offering a guiding ideology for further designing high-performance photocatalysts&lt;/i&gt;.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202201767"&gt;10.1002/chem.202201767&lt;/a&gt;).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Is  &#8208;PETase has become an enzyme of significant interest due to its ability to catalyse the degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) at mesophilic temperatures. &#8232;We performed hybrid quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) at the DSD&#8208;PBEP86&#8208;D3/ma&#8208;def2&#8208;TZVP/CHARMM27//rev&#8208;PBE&#8208;D3/dev2&#8208;SVP/CHARMM level to calculate the energy profile for the degradation of a suitable PET model by this enzyme. Very low overall barriers are computed for serine protease&#8208;type hydrolysis steps (as low as 34.1 kJ mol  &#8208;1  ). Spontaneous deprotonation of the final product, terephthalic acid, with a high computed driving force indicates that product release could be rate limiting.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient photoredox cycles to control perylenediimide self&#8208;assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoreduction of perylenediimide (PDI) derivatives has been widely studied for use in photocatalysis, hydrogen evolution, photo&#8208;responsive gels, and organic semiconductors. Upon light irradiation, the radical anion (PDI &#8226;&#8211; ) can readily be obtained, whereas further reduction to the dianion (PDI 2&#8211; ) is rare. Here we show that full 2&#8208;electron photoreduction can be achieved using UVC light: 1) in anaerobic conditions by &#8216;direct photoreduction&#8217; of PDI aggregates, or 2) by &#8216;indirect photoreduction&#8217; in aerobic conditions due to acetone ketyl radicals. The latter strategy is also efficient for other dyes, such as naphthalenediimide (NDI) and methylviologen (MV 2+ ). Efficient photoreduction on the minute time&#8208;scale using simple LED light in aerobic conditions is attractive for use in dissipative light&#8208;driven systems and materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Br&#248;nsted acid vs phase&#8208;transfer catalysis in the enantioselective transannular aminohalogenation of enesultams</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have studied the enantioselective transannular aminohalogenation reaction using unsaturated medium&#8208;sized cyclic benzosulfonamides using both chiral Bronsted acid or phase&#8208;transfer catalysis. Under the optimized reaction conditions a variety of bicyclic adducts can be obtained with good yields and high enantioselectivities.

Under the optimized reaction conditions a variety of bicyclic adducts can be obtained with good yields and high enantioselectivities. The mechanism of the reaction has also been studied using computational tools observing that the reaction involves the participation of a conformer of the nine-membered cyclic substrate with planar chirality in which the stereochemical outcome is controlled by the relative reactivity of the two pseudorotational enantiomers when interacting with the chiral catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Upon two&#8208;electron oxidation, they are reversibly transformed into the title dications (  1  2+  and  2  2+  ) exhibiting near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorptions, which were also isolated as stable salts. These redox pairs can serve as new entries into less well&#8208;explored organic NIR&#8208;electrochromic systems, and the separation of redox peaks (electrochemical bistability) was attained for  1  /  1  2+  and  2  /  2  2+  , thanks to drastic geometrical changes between neutral and dicationic states, as revealed by a series of X&#8208;ray analyses. Thiepin&#8208;  S,S  &#8208;dioxide analogue (  3  /  3  2+  ) exhibits quite similar redox behavior due to nonaromatic nature of the dibenzothiepin or &#8208;oxepin unit in  1  2+  and  2  2+  , whereas thiepin&#8208;  S  &#8208;oxide derivative (  4  /  4  2+  ) does not exhibit bistability due to the less change in geometry upon electron transfer, showing that a subtle change of a bridging atom in the central seven&#8208;membered ring can modify the redox properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Advance and Designing Strategies in Polymeric Antifungal Agents Inspired by Membrane&#8208;Active Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The growing prevalence of invasive fungal diseases, the scarcity of existing antifungal drugs, and the continued emergence of antifungal drug resistance urge the development of new antifungal agents. This concept discusses and highlights the advance and designing strategies of antifungal polymeric agents with a focus on design principles inspired by membrane&#8208;active peptides, including host defense peptides and cell&#8208;penetrating peptides.







Abstract
The high&#8208;mortality invasive fungal infections seriously threaten the lives of immunocompromised people. Host defense peptides and cell&#8208;penetrating peptides are representative membrane&#8208;active peptides with different functions. Among them, host defense peptides mimicking is a valid strategy in the design of synthetic antifungal agents. Despite the brilliance in the field of intracellular delivery, the potential of cell&#8208;penetrating peptides and their mimics for designing antifungal agents has been overlooked. In this concept article, we describe the structural design of synthetic antifungal polymers as mimics of host defense peptides, and highlight the effectiveness and potential of cell&#8208;penetrating peptide&#8208;inspired strategy in designing potent and selective antifungal polymeric agents. In addition, an outlook for further expanding the design horizons of antifungal polymers is also presented.

         <title>Dual MOF&#8208;Derived MoS2/CdS Photocatalysts with Rich Sulfur Vacancies for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual MOF&#8208;derived MoS2/CdS photocatalyst with abundant sulfur vacancies was synthesized by in&#8197;situ growth of CdS nanoparticles on 2D MoS2. Because of the existence of both 1T phase and sulfur vacancies, MoS2/CdS not only shows strong charge transport ability, but also possesses prolonged photoelectron lifetime. The 1&#8201;%MoS2/CdS exhibited 27 times higher hydrogen generation activity than pristine CdS.







Abstract
Cocatalyst plays an important role in efficient charge transfer and separation for photocatalysis. Herein, a MoS2/CdS photocatalyst with MoS2 as cocatalyst was designed by using Mo&#8208;MOF and Cd&#8208;MOF as precursors. Due to the existence of rich sulfur vacancies and 1T phase, MoS2 shows strong charge capture and transport ability. The photo&#8208;generated electrons on conduction band (CB) can be bound by the sulfur vacancy of CdS and effectively transported to MoS2 through the compact interface between the CdS nanoparticles and 2D large&#8208;scale MoS2. The optimal photocatalyst 1&#8201;%MoS2/CdS exhibited dramatically improved photocatalytic hydrogen production activity, which is 28 times that of pristine CdS and even about 2 times that of 1&#8201;%Pt/CdS with same loading amount of noble metal Pt. This work highlights the role of Mo&#8208;MOF derived MoS2 with 1T&#8208;2H phases as a sustainable and prospective candidate of cocatalyst for improving charge separation and photocatalytic stability of MoS2/CdS composites.

         <title>Electrochemically Determining Electronic Structure of ZnO Quantum Dots with Different Surface Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is employed to determine the band edges and trap states of ZnO QDs with different surface ligands. It is demonstrated that the ZnO QDs without surface ligands mainly have oxygen interstitial defects whilst the ZnO QDs covered with ligands contain oxygen vacancies.







Abstract
The electronic structure of quantum dots (QDs) including band edges and possible trap states is an important physical property for optoelectronic applications. The reliable determination of the energy levels of QDs remains a big challenge. Herein we employ cyclic voltammetry (CV) to determine the energy levels of three types of ZnO QDs with different surface ligands. Coupled with spectroscopic techniques, it is found that the onset potential of the first reductive wave is likely related to the conduction band edges while the first oxidative wave originates from the trap states. The determined specific energy levels in CV further demonstrates that the ZnO QDs without surface ligands mainly have oxygen interstitial defects whilst the ZnO QDs covered with ligands contain oxygen vacancies. The present electrochemical method offers a powerful and effective way to determine the energy levels of wide bandgap ZnO QDs, which will boost their device performance.

         <title>Tetrahalidometallate(II) Ionic Liquids with More than One Metal: The Effect of Bromide versus Chloride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A question of halide: Transition metal&#8208;based ionic liquids (ILs) are promising candidates for electrochemical energy. Bromide&#8208;based ILs are particularly interesting for their high electrochemical stability, although their conductivities are significantly lower than those of their chloride analogues. [MBr4]2&#8722; units are therefore highly promising building blocks for advanced electrochemically active ILs.







Abstract
Fifteen N&#8208;butylpyridinium salts &#8211; five monometallic [C4Py]2[MBr4] and ten bimetallic [C4Py]2[M0.5aM0.5bBr4] (M=Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Zn) &#8211; were synthesized, and their structures and thermal and electrochemical properties were studied. All the compounds are ionic liquids (ILs) with melting points between 64 and 101&#8201;&#176;C. Powder and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction show that all ILs are isostructural. The electrochemical stability windows of the ILs are between 2 and 3&#8197;V. The conductivities at room temperature are between 10&#8722;5 and 10&#8722;6&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. At elevated temperatures, the conductivities reach up to 10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 70&#8201;&#176;C. The structures and properties of the current bromide&#8208;based ILs were also compared with those of previous examples using chloride ligands, which illustrated differences and similarities between the two groups of ILs.

&lt;p&gt;Fifteen &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-butylpyridinium salts &#8211; five monometallic [C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Py]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[MBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] and ten bimetallic [C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Py]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[M&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] (M=Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Zn) &#8211; were synthesized, and their structures and thermal and electrochemical properties were studied. All the compounds are ionic liquids (ILs) with melting points between 64 and 101&#8201;&#176;C. Powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction show that all ILs are isostructural. The electrochemical stability windows of the ILs are between 2 and 3&#8197;V. The conductivities at room temperature are between 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;5&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. At elevated temperatures, the conductivities reach up to 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 70&#8201;&#176;C. The structures and properties of the current bromide-based ILs were also compared with those of previous examples using chloride ligands, which illustrated differences and similarities between the two groups of ILs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Profiling Heparan Sulfate&#8211;Heavy Metal Ions Interaction Using Electrochemical Techniques</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The connection between heparan sulfate molecular components and heavy metal ion binding is largely unknown because of the complexity and the heterogeneity of the polysaccharide, which limit the ability to study those interactions. By assembling rationally designed synthetic heparan sulfates on surfaces, we have developed new ways to correlate glycan stereochemistry and sulfate group regiochemistry with heavy metal ion binding and selectivity. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Kikkeri, S. Yitzchaik, M. Hurevich, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202193).

         <title>Interface Engineering of Conjugated Polymer Based Composites for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalysis can create a green way to produce clean energy resources, degrade pollutant as well as achieve carbon neutral, making the construction of efficient photocatalysts significant in solving environmental issues. Conjugated polymers (CPs) with adjustable band structures have superior light absorption capacity and flexible morphology that facilitate the contact with other components to form advanced heterojunctions. Interface engineering can strengthen the interfacial contact between the components and further enlarge interfacial contact area, enhance light absorption, accelerate charge transfer and improve the reusability of the composites. In order to throw some new light on heterojunction interface regulation at molecular level, we summarize CP&#8208;based composites with improved photocatalytic performance according to the types of interactions (covalent bonding, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, and other polar interactions) between the components and introduce the corresponding interface building methods, identify techniques. Then the roles of interfaces in different photocatalytic applications are discussed. Finally, we sum up the existing problems in interface engineering of CP&#8208;based composites and look forward to the possible solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>Bromine Pentafluoride BrF5, the Formation of [BrF6]&#8722; Salts, and the Sterical (In)Activity of the Br Lone Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>BrF  5  can be prepared by the reaction of BrF  3  with fluorine under UV light in the region of 300 to 400 nm at room temperature. It was analyzed by UV&#8208;Vis, NMR, IR and Raman spectroscopy. Its crystal structure was redetermined by X&#8208;ray diffraction and the space group corrected to  Pnma  . Quantum chemical calculations were performed for the band assignment of the vibrational spectra. A monoclinic polymorph of BrF  5  was quantum chemically predicted and then observed as its low&#8208;temperature modification in space group  P  2  1  /  c  by single crystal diffraction. BrF  5  reacts with the alkali metal fluorides  A  F (  A  = K, Rb) to form alkali metal hexafluoridobromates(V),  A  [BrF  6  ] whose crystal structures have been determined. Both compounds crystallize in the K[AsF  6  ] structure type (  R [[EQUATION]] , no. 148,  hR  24). For the species [BrF  6  ]  +  , BrF  5  , [BrF  6  ]  &#8722;  and [IF  6  ]  &#8722;  the chemical bonds and lone pairs on the heavy atoms were investigated by means of Intrinsic Bond Orbital analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the potential of innovative gold(I) and silver(I) selenourea complexes as anticancer agents targeting TrxR and cellular redox homeostasis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of NHC&#8208;based selenourea Ag(I) and Au(I) complexes were evaluated for their anticancer potential  in vitro  , on 2D and 3D human cancer cell systems. All NHC&#8208;based selenourea complexes possess an outstanding cytotoxic potency, which was comparable or even better than that of the reference metallodrug auranofin, and were also able to overcome both platinum&#8208;based and multi&#8208;drug resistances. Intriguingly, their cytotoxic potency did not correlate with solution stability, partition coefficient or cellular uptake. On the other hand, mechanistic studies in cancer cells revealed their ability to strongly and selectively inhibit the redox&#8208;regulating enzyme Thioredoxin Reductase (TrxR), being even more effective than auranofin, a well&#8208;known TrxR inhibitor, without affecting other redox enzymes such as Glutathione Reductase (GR). The inhibition of TrxR in H157 human cancer cells caused, in turn, the disruption of cellular thiol&#8208;redox homeostasis and of mitochondria pathophysiology, ultimately leading to cancer cell death through apoptosis.</dc:description>

All of these oligonucleotides formed very stable duplexes with complementary sequences pairing the organometallic moiety with either 2&#8208; or 4&#8208;thiothymine. The isomeric monomercurated oligonucleotides were also able to discriminate between 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;thiothymine based on different melting temperatures of the respective duplexes. DFT&#8208;optimized structures of the most stable mononuclear Hg(II)&#8208;mediated base pairs featured a coordinate covalent bond between Hg(II) and either S2 or S4 and a hydrogen bond between the carbazole nitrogen and N3. The dinuclear Hg(II)&#8208;mediated base pairs, in turn, were geometrically very similar to the one previously reported to form between 1,8&#8208;dimercuri&#8208;6&#8208;phenyl&#8208;carbazole and thymine and had one Hg(II) ion coordinated to a thio and the other one to an oxo substituent.</dc:description>

Strength in weakness: Weakly hydrophobic, plasma&#8208;activated surfaces silanized with a disilazane turned out to be optimal for single&#8208;molecule fluorescence measurements of biological molecular machines. The novel silanization assay reduced the work load more than tenfold and does not require any organic solvents, thus making the assay environmentally friendly and efficient.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule assays often require functionalized surfaces. One approach for microtubule assays renders surfaces hydrophobic and uses amphiphilic blocking agents. However, the optimal hydrophobicity is unclear, protocols take long, produce toxic waste, and are susceptible to failure. Our method uses plasma activation with hydrocarbons for hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) silanization in the gas phase. We measured the surface hydrophobicity, its effect on how well microtubule filaments were bound to the surface, and the number of nonspecific interactions with kinesin motor proteins. Additionally, we tested and discuss the use of different silanes and activation methods. We found that even weakly hydrophobic surfaces were optimal. Our environmentally friendly method significanty reduced the overall preparation effort and resulted in reproducible, high&#8208;quality surfaces with low variability. We expect the method to be applicable to a wide range of other single&#8208;molecule assays.

Abstract
Rechargeable lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries (LOBs) are considered to be the next&#8208;generation energy technology owing to their high theoretical energy density. However, the sluggish cathode kinetics and degradation of Li anodes result in large voltage hysteresis and low coulombic efficiency. Various materials have been applied to promote the electrochemical performance of LOBs. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) possessing porous structures, open active sites and adjustable pore sizes have been attempted as promising materials for catalysts and separators of LOBs. This concept presents an overview of different MOF&#8208;based catalysts for LOBs, including traditional, conductive, semi&#8208;conductive and soluble MOFs, as well as our recently proposed photo&#8208;involved LOBs. Recent advances in MOF&#8208;based separators to restrain the shuttling of redox mediators between cathodes and anodes and suppress the formation of lithium dendrites are also discussed. Finally, perspectives on the development of MOF&#8208;based LOBs for future research are presented.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An azaphosphatrane (AZAP) forms a host:guest 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex with the cucurbit[10]uril (CB[10]) macrocycle in water and forces CB[10] to adopt an 8&#8208;shape with AZAP occupying the majority of the cavity. The CB[10] contraction leads to a residual space which favors the co&#8208;inclusion of planar and monocationic co&#8208;guest (CG) molecules, affording heteroternary CB[10]&#8901;AZAP&#8901;CG complexes.







Abstract
The globular and monocationic guest molecule trimethyl&#8208;azaphosphatrane (AZAP, a protonated Verkade superbase) was shown to form a host:guest 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex with the cucurbit[10]uril (CB[10]) macrocycle in water. Molecular dynamics calculations showed that CB[10] adopts an 8&#8208;shape with AZAP occupying the majority of the internal space, CB[10] contracting around AZAP and leaving a significant part of the cavity unoccupied. This residual space was used to co&#8208;include planar and monocationic co&#8208;guest (CG) molecules, affording heteroternary CB[10]&#8901;AZAP&#8901;CG complexes potentially opening new perspectives in supramolecular chemistry.

         <title>Electrical&#8208;Conductive/Insulating Bi&#8208;Functional Layers for Stable Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc&#8208;ion batteries: A strategy of electrical&#8208;conductive/insulating bi&#8208;functional layers is proposed to reduce local current density and the difference of Zn metal surface concentration, avoiding direct contact between electrolyte and electrode, and alleviating crazy dendrite growth by coordinating the functions of different coating domains. This strategy is expected to provide a design concept and reference for the realization of dendrite&#8208;free ZIBs.







Abstract
Zinc&#8208;ion batteries are regarded as an extremely promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage equipment due to the inexpensive ingredients and high safety. However, dendrite growth and side reactions occur in the Zn anode, which lead to exceedingly low coulombic efficiency (CE) and poor cycling stability. In this work, we propose a strategy of a conductive/insulating bi&#8208;functional coating layer (CIBL) for stable Zn metal anodes. Porous Ag nanowires (NWs) coating as a conductive layer effectively reduces the nuclear barrier and contains Zn2+ deposition in a certain space. Polyimide (PI) coatings as insulating layer implement a shunting effect on Zn2+, which could reduce the differential concentration on the Zn surface and induce uniform deposition of Zn2+. Therefore, the CIBL&#8722;Zn//CIBL&#8722;Zn battery achieves stable plating/stripping of over 1300&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The CE of CIBL&#8722;Zn//CIBL&#8722;Zn battery maintains at 99.2&#8201;% even after 1000 cycles.

     alt="Electrical-Conductive/Insulating Bi-Functional Layers for Stable Zn Metal Anode"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Zinc-ion batteries&lt;/b&gt;: A strategy of electrical-conductive/insulating bi-functional layers is proposed to reduce local current density and the difference of Zn metal surface concentration, avoiding direct contact between electrolyte and electrode, and alleviating crazy dendrite growth by coordinating the functions of different coating domains. This strategy is expected to provide a design concept and reference for the realization of dendrite-free ZIBs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zinc-ion batteries are regarded as an extremely promising candidate for large-scale energy storage equipment due to the inexpensive ingredients and high safety. However, dendrite growth and side reactions occur in the Zn anode, which lead to exceedingly low coulombic efficiency (CE) and poor cycling stability. In this work, we propose a strategy of a conductive/insulating bi-functional coating layer (CIBL) for stable Zn metal anodes. Porous Ag nanowires (NWs) coating as a conductive layer effectively reduces the nuclear barrier and contains Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; deposition in a certain space. Polyimide (PI) coatings as insulating layer implement a shunting effect on Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, which could reduce the differential concentration on the Zn surface and induce uniform deposition of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, the CIBL&#8722;Zn//CIBL&#8722;Zn battery achieves stable plating/stripping of over 1300&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The CE of CIBL&#8722;Zn//CIBL&#8722;Zn battery maintains at 99.2&#8201;% even after 1000 cycles. Moreover, the CIBL&#8722;Zn//V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; battery exhibits a capacity of nearly 289.2&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 3000 cycles and no sign of capacity degradation is found, which further demonstrate the feasibility of this strategy in practical application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Piezo&#8208;Fenton System with Rapid Iron Cycling and Hydrogen Peroxide Self&#8208;Supplying Driven by Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The piezo&#8208;Fenton system has attracted attention not only because it can enhance the Fenton reaction activity by mechanical energy input, but also because it is expected to realize a class of stimuli&#8208;responsive advanced oxidation systems by regulating energy input and hydrogen peroxide self&#8208;supply, thus greatly enriching the application possibilities of Fenton chemistry. In this work, a series of Fe&#8208;doped g&#8208;C3N4  (g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;Fe) as a piezo&#8208;Fenton system were synthesized where the iron stably immobilized through Fe&#8208;N interaction. The piezo&#8208;induced electrons generate on g&#8208;C3N4  matrix support the conversion of Fe(III) to Fe(II) and promote rate&#8208;limiting step of Fenton reaction. With the optimal Fe loading, g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;0.5Fe can achieve methylene blue (MB) degradation under ultrasonic treatment with first&#8208;order kinetic rate constants of 75&#215; 10&#8208;3  min&#8208;1  . Most importantly, the g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;Fe can maintain good catalytic activity in a wide pH range (pH=2.0~9.0) and be cyclic used without iron leaching to solution (&lt;0.001 &#956;g&#215;L&#8208;1  ), overcoming the disadvantage of traditional Fe&#8208;based Fenton catalysts that can only be applied under acidic conditions and prone to secondary pollution. In addition, g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;0.5Fe also exhibits antibacterial properties of  Escherichia coli  and  Staphylococcus aureus  under ultrasound. Hydroxyl radicals mainly contribute to the degradation of MB and the sterilization process. Our work is an attempt to clarify the role of g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;Fe in the conversion of mechanical energy to ROS and provide inspirations for the piezo&#8208;Fenton system design.</dc:description>

         <title>DOTP versus DOTA as ligands for lanthanide cations: Novel structurally characterized Ce(IV) and Ce(III) cyclen&#8208;based complexes and clusters in aqueous solutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A delve into the coordination and redox chemistry of aqueous CeIV/III macrocyclic compounds was performed using the DOTA and DOTP ligands (1,4,7,10&#8208;Tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetrayl)tetraacetic acid and 1,4,7,10&#8208;Tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetra(methylene phosphonic acid) respectively). The hydrolysis tendency of the tetravalent cation in the presence of DOTA is shown to result in the formation of highly&#8208;ordered, fluorite&#8208;like [CeIV6(O)4(OH)4(H2O)8(DOTAH)4] oxo&#8208;hydroxo structure both in solution and in the solid state. The lifetime of the analogous species formed in the presence of DOTP was found to be much shorter. Spectroscopic measurements suggest its similarity to the former. Its gradual in solution decomposition leads to the accumulation of the in cage complexes of [CeIVDOTP] and [CeIIIDOTP(H2O)], which were crystallographically characterized in the present study. The redox energetics and spectroscopic characteristics for the transition between these two in&#8208;cage complexes in aqueous solutions were studied as well. Together with the crystallographic structures of the abovementioned species, the in cage [CeIVDOTA(H2O)] complex structure is presented herein as well for the first time. An elaborative analysis of the x&#8208;ray crystallographic structural data obtained for the herein studied in cage complexes and similar structures published previously, suggests that hard bonding cyclen derived ligands are, counter&#8208;intuitively, better suited for encapsulating, and perhaps kinetically stabilize softer cations than harder ones with DOTP, marked as a possible adequate chelator for the study of the aqueous properties of LnII and AcIII cations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A practical protocol for the first regiodivergent asymmetric addition of aryl and alkenyl organometallic reagents to substituted N&#8208; alkyl pyridinium heterocycles is described. The couplings proceed with high regiochemical and stereochemical selectivities, and provide access to chiral 1,2,3&#8208; and 1,3,4&#8208;trisubstituted dihydropyridine products, as controlled by judicious choice of nitrogen activating agent. To this end, a correlation was found between the parameterized size of the activating group and the C2/C4 regioselectivity in the couplings. The utility of the described chemistry was demonstrated in two concise asymmetric syntheses of (+)&#8208; N &#8208;methylaspidospermidine and (&#8211;)&#8208;paroxetine.</dc:description>

         <title>Directing the Self&#8208;Assembly of Aromatic Foldamer Helices using Acridine Appendages and Metal Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic foldamers helices constitute convenient rigid scaffolds but rarely form ordered arrays upon self&#8208;assembly or in crystals. We show that placing acridine appendages at defined position at the surface of aromatic helices guide their organization in the solid state to form discrete dimers or 1D arrays. Furthermore, metal&#8208;coordination at the acridine units of the same compounds drives self&#8208;assembly in solution.







Abstract
Folded molecules provide complex interaction interfaces amenable to sophisticated self&#8208;assembly motifs. Because of their high conformational stability, aromatic foldamers constitute suitable candidates for the rational elaboration of self&#8208;assembled architectures. Several multiturn helical aromatic oligoamides have been synthesized that possess arrays of acridine appendages pointing in one or two directions. The acridine units were shown to direct self&#8208;assembly in the solid state via aromatic stacking leading to recurrent helix&#8208;helix association patterns under the form of discrete dimers or extended arrays. In the presence of Pd(II), metal coordination of the acridine units overwhelms other forces and generates new metal&#8208;mediated multihelical self&#8208;assemblies, including macrocycles. These observations demonstrate simple access to different types of foldamer&#8208;containing architectures, ranging from discrete objects to 1D and, by extension, 2D and 3D arrays.

         <title>Directed Palladium Catalyzed C&#8722;H (Ethoxycarbonyl)difluoromethylthiolation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unprecedented construction of a C(sp2)&#8208;SCF2CO2Et bond was successfully achieved by Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation. This robust protocol allowed the functionalization of a broad panel of aromatic and olefinic derivatives (37&#8197;examples, up to 87&#8201;% yield), a real advance as existing routes were restricted to the SCF3 and SCF2H residues. Post&#8208;functionalization reactions further illustrated the synthetic value of this fluorinated motif.







Abstract
The unprecedented Pd&#8208;catalyzed (ethoxycarbonyl)difluoromethylthiolation reaction of various unsaturated derivatives was studied. In the presence of the (ethoxycarbonyl)difluoromethylsulfenamide reagent I and under mild reaction conditions (60&#8201;&#176;C), both 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl and 2&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;vinyl)pyridine derivatives were smoothly functionalized with this methodology (37 examples, up to 87&#8201;% yield). Moreover, the synthetic interest of this fluorinated moiety was further showcased by its conversion into various original fluorinated residues. Finally, a plausible mechanism for this transformation was suggested.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The unprecedented construction of a C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)-SCF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Et bond&lt;/b&gt; was successfully achieved by Pd-catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation. This robust protocol allowed the functionalization of a broad panel of aromatic and olefinic derivatives (37&#8197;examples, up to 87&#8201;% yield), a real advance as existing routes were restricted to the SCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and SCF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H residues. Post-functionalization reactions further illustrated the synthetic value of this fluorinated motif.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unprecedented Pd-catalyzed (ethoxycarbonyl)difluoromethylthiolation reaction of various unsaturated derivatives was studied. In the presence of the (ethoxycarbonyl)difluoromethylsulfenamide reagent &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt; and under mild reaction conditions (60&#8201;&#176;C), both 2-(hetero)aryl and 2-(&#945;-aryl-vinyl)pyridine derivatives were smoothly functionalized with this methodology (37 examples, up to 87&#8201;% yield). Moreover, the synthetic interest of this fluorinated moiety was further showcased by its conversion into various original fluorinated residues. Finally, a plausible mechanism for this transformation was suggested.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Approach for Expanding the Three&#8208;Dimensional Space of Tetrahydroquinoline to Develop BET Bromodomain Inhibitors
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple and selective. Assembling simple functional groups by proline organocatalysis coupled with the addition of BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 in the same flask allows for the mild formation of aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide species that undergo nucleophilic addition to give access to enantio&#8208;enriched tri&#8208;substituted tetrahydroquinolines with a novel configuration. This advanced three&#8208;dimensional structure, after only two additional steps, gave rise to a valuable enantiopure and selective anti&#8208;inflammatory compound.







Abstract
The pharmaceutical industry has a pervasive need for chiral specific molecules with optimal affinity for their biological targets. However, the mass production of such compounds is currently limited by conventional chemical routes, that are costly and have an environmental impact. Here, we propose an easy access to obtain new tetrahydroquinolines, a motif found in many bioactive compounds, that is rapid and cost effective. Starting from simple raw materials, the procedure uses a proline&#8208;catalyzed Mannich reaction followed by the addition of BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2, which generates a highly electrophilic aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide intermediate capable of reacting with different nucleophiles to form the diversely functionalized tetrahydroquinoline. Moreover, this enantioselective one&#8208;pot process provides access for the first time to tetrahydroquinolines with a cis&#8208;2,3 and trans&#8208;3,4 configuration. As proof of concept, we demonstrate that a three&#8208;step reaction sequence, from simple and inexpensive starting compounds and catalysts, can generate a BD2&#8208;selective BET bromodomain inhibitor with anti&#8208;inflammatory effect.

         <title>Specific Lipid Studies in Complex Membranes by Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Specific interactions with phospholipids are often critical for the function of proteins or drugs, but studying these interactions at high&#8208;resolution remains difficult, especially in complex membranes that mimic biological conditions. In principle, molecular interactions with phospholipids could be directly probed by solid&#8208;state NMR (ssNMR). However, due to the challenge to detect specific lipids in mixed liposomes and limited spectral sensitivity, ssNMR studies of specific lipids in complex membranes are scarce. Here, by using purified biological 13C,15N&#8208;labelled phospholipids, we show that we can selectivity detect traces of specific lipids in complex membranes. In combination with 1H&#8208;detected ssNMR, we show that our approach provides unprecedented high&#8208;resolution insights into the mechanisms of drugs that target specific lipids. This broadly applicable approach opens new opportunities for the molecular characterization of specific lipid interactions with proteins or drugs in complex fluid membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhibitory Effect of DMSO on Halohydrin Dehalogenase: Experimental and Computational Insights into the Influence of an Organic Co&#8208;solvent on the Structural and Catalytic Properties of a Biocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pros and cons considered: Halohydrin dehalogenases (HHDHs) are versatile enzymes employed in the synthesis of chiral building blocks. To increase substrate solubility, DMSO stands out as the most commonly used co&#8208;solvent. Here we found that DMSO acts as an inhibitor of the enzyme HheC. To understand the observed phenomena at the molecular level, in&#8208;depth experimental studies were performed in combination with molecular dynamics simulations.







Abstract
Although the application of organic solvents in biocatalysis is well explored, in&#8208;depth understanding of the interactions of solvent with proteins, in particular oligomeric ones, is still scant. Understanding these interactions is essential in tailoring enzymes for industrially relevant catalysis in nonaqueous media. In our study, the homotetrameric enzyme halohydrin dehalogenase (HHDH) from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1 (HheC) was investigated, as a model system, in DMSO/water solvent mixtures. DMSO, the most commonly used co&#8208;solvent for biocatalytic transformations, was found to act as a mixed&#8208;type inhibitor with a prevalent competitive contribution. Even 5&#8201;% (v/v) DMSO inhibits the activity of HheC by half. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed that DMSO keeps close to Ser&#8208;Tyr catalytic residues forming alternate H&#8208;bonds with them. Stability measurements paired with differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic light scattering methods and MD studies revealed that HheC maintains its structural integrity with as much as 30&#8201;% (v/v) DMSO.

         <title>Towards Substrate&#8208;Reagent Interaction of Lochmann&#8208;Schlosser Bases in THF: Bridging THF Hides Potential Reaction Site of a Chiral Superbase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metalation of N,N&#8208;dimethylaminomethylferrocene in THF by the superbasic mixture of nBuLi/KOtBu proceeds readily at low temperatures to afford a bimetallic Li2K2 aggregate containing ferrocenyl anions and tert &#8208;butoxide. Starting from an enantiomerically enriched ortho &#8208;lithiated aminomethylferrocene an enantiomerically pure superbase can be prepared. The molecular compound exhibits superbasic behavior deprotonating N,N&#8208;dimethylbenzylamine in the &#945;&#8208;position and is also capable of deprotonating toluene. Quantum chemical calculations provide insight into the role of the bridging THF molecule to the possible substrate&#8208;reagent interaction. In addition, a benzylpotassium alkoxide adduct gives a closer look into the corresponding reaction site of the Lochmann&#8208;Schlosser base we are reporting herein.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Due to their high stability towards enzymatic hydrolysis  C  &#8208;acyl glycosidic compounds are useful synthetic intermediates for potential candidates in drug discovery. Syntheses for  C  &#8208;acyl mannosides have remained scarce and usually employ donors obtained from lengthy syntheses. Furthermore, syntheses of unprotected  C&#8208;  acyl mannosides have not been reported so far, due to the incapability of the  C  &#8208;acyl mannoside motif with deprotection conditions for protective groups commonly used in carbohydrate chemistry. Herein, we report an efficient and highly &#945;&#8209;selective four&#8208;step one&#8208;pot method for the synthesis of  C  &#8208;acyl &#945;&#8208;  d  &#8208;manno&#8208;,  l  &#8208;rhamno&#8208; and  d  &#8208;lyxopyranosides from easily accessible persilylated monosaccharides and dithianes requiring only trace amounts of a copper source as catalyst and explain the crucial role of the catalyst by mechanistic studies.

         <title>Competing C&#8208;4&#8201;and C&#8208;5&#8208;Acyl Stabilization of Uronic Acid Glycosyl Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uronic acids have a unique reactivity in stereoselective glycosylation reactions. The competing intramolecular stabilization in uronic acid cations by the C&#8208;5 carboxylic acid or the C&#8208;4 acetyl group was studied using infrared ion spectroscopy and computational energy landscape maps. This reveals how the intrinsic interplay of the different functional groups influences the formation of the different regioisomeric products.







Abstract
Uronic acids are carbohydrates carrying a terminal carboxylic acid and have a unique reactivity in stereoselective glycosylation reactions. Herein, the competing intramolecular stabilization of uronic acid cations by the C&#8208;5 carboxylic acid or the C&#8208;4 acetyl group was studied with infrared ion spectroscopy (IRIS). IRIS reveals that a mixture of bridged ions is formed, in which the mixture is driven towards the C&#8208;1,C&#8208;5 dioxolanium ion when the C&#8208;5,C&#8208;2&#8208;relationship is cis, and towards the formation of the C&#8208;1,C&#8208;4 dioxepanium ion when this relation is trans. Isomer&#8208;population analysis and interconversion barrier computations show that the two bridged structures are not in dynamic equilibrium and that their ratio parallels the density functional theory computed stability of the structures. These studies reveal how the intrinsic interplay of the different functional groups influences the formation of the different regioisomeric products.

         <title>Reaction of Pertechnetate in Highly Alkaline Solution: Synthesis and Characterization of the Nitridotrioxotechnetate Ba[TcO3N]</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hot chemistry. The nitridotrioxotechnetate anion has been obtained by the reaction of ammonium pertechnetate under highly alkaline conditions. In addition to a single crystal structure analysis, Raman data proves the existence of Tc&#8722;O and Tc&#8722;N bonds. The oxidation state +VII has further been corroborate by XANES and EXAFS measurements.







Abstract
The preparation of novel technetium oxides, their characterization and the general investigation of technetium chemistry are of significant importance, since fundamental research has so far mainly focused on the group homologues. Whereas the structure chemistry of technetium in strongly oxidizing media is dominated by the 
 anion, our recent investigation yielded the new 
 anion. Brown single crystals of Ba[TcO3N] were obtained under hydrothermal conditions starting from Ba(OH)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;8H2O and NH4[TcO4] at 200&#8201;&#176;C. 
 crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system with the space group P21/n (a=7.2159(4)&#8197;&#197;, b=7.8536(5)&#8197;&#197;, c=7.4931(4)&#8197;&#197; and &#946;=104.279(2)&#176;). The crystal structure of 
 consists of isolated 
 tetrahedra, which are surrounded by Ba2+ cations. XANES measurements complement the oxidation state +VII for technetium and Raman spectroscopic experiments on Ba[TcO3N] single crystals exhibit characteristic Tc&#8722;O and Tc&#8722;N vibrational modes.

         <title>Elucidating the Nature of the External Acid Sites of ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolites Using NMR Probe Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure and acid properties of external sites of ZSM&#8208;5&#8201;zeolites, namely terminal SiOH groups, pore&#8208;mouth Br&#248;nsted, and tricoordinated Al&#8208;Lewis acid sites, are elucidated through the interaction of samples of distinct particle size with the NMR probe molecule trimethylphosphine oxide, assisted by computational methods.







Abstract
The identification of acid and nonacid species at the external surface of zeolites remains a major challenge, in contrast to the extensively&#8208;studied internal acid sites. Here, it is shown that the synthesis of zeolite ZSM&#8208;5 samples with distinct particle sizes, combined with solid&#8208;state NMR and computational studies of trimethylphosphine oxide (TMPO) adsorption, provides insight into the chemical species on the external surface of the zeolite crystals. 1H&#8211;31P HETCOR NMR spectra of TMPO&#8208;loaded zeolites exhibit a broad correlation peak at &#948;P &#8764;35&#8211;55&#8197;ppm and &#948;H &#8764;5&#8211;12&#8197;ppm assigned to external SiOH species. Pore&#8208;mouth Br&#248;nsted acid sites exhibit 31P and 1H NMR resonances and adsorption energies close to those reported for internal acid sites interacting with TMPO. The presence of an external tricoordinate Al&#8208;Lewis site interacting strongly with TMPO is suggested, resulting in 31P resonances that overlap with the peaks usually ascribed to the interaction of TMPO with Br&#248;nsted sites.

         <title>An Iodide&#8208;Mediated Anodic Amide Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical coupling of amines and carboxylic acids generates a wide variety of amides and dipeptides. The operationally simple and robust process is mediated by iodide and produces triphenylphosphine oxide as a recyclable co&#8208;product. A combination of boron&#8208;doped diamond (BDD) anode and a platinum cathode ensures maximum performance. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Opatz et&#8197;al.

         <title>Photochromic Fentanyl Derivatives for Controlled &#956;&#8208;Opioid Receptor Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoresponsive fentanyl&#8208;based ligands provide the opportunity to spatially, temporally, and non&#8208;invasively regulate &#956;&#8208;opioid receptor activity by using light. The repertoire of such ligands has been expanded in this work, yielding a desirable selection that differ in photophysical properties and/or metabotropic response.







Abstract
Photoswitchable ligands as biological tools provide an opportunity to explore the kinetics and dynamics of the clinically relevant &#956;&#8208;opioid receptor. These ligands can potentially activate or deactivate the receptor when desired by using light. Spatial and temporal control of biological activity allows for application in a diverse range of biological investigations. Photoswitchable ligands have been developed in this work, modelled on the known agonist fentanyl, with the aim of expanding the current &#8220;toolbox&#8221; of fentanyl photoswitchable ligands. In doing so, ligands have been developed that change geometry (isomerize) upon exposure to light, with varying photophysical and biochemical properties. This variation in properties could be valuable in further studying the functional significance of the &#956;&#8208;opioid receptor.

         <title>Infusion of Variable Chemical Structure to Tune Stacking among Metal&#8211;Organic Layers in 2D Nano MOFs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stacking vs thickness: Stacking between the metal&#8211;organic layers (MOLs) of MOFs determines their thickness: the higher the stacking, the higher the thickness. This thickness plays an important role in controlling the function of the material, hence, regulating the stacking in 2D nano&#8208;MOFs might be very important. We tuned the stacking by modulating the chemical structure of the organic linkers in a series of isostructural MOFs. AFM, XRPD, FESEM, etc. showed the chemical functionality of the linkers to play a pivotal role in modulating stacking efficiency. Such an approach might open a new avenue in controlling the thickness of 2D materials. More information can be found in the Research Article by B. Manna, S. Ida et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201665).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,3&#8208;Dipolar cycloadditions of azomethine ylide (three atoms highlighted in yellow) and a broad scope of alkenyl boronates (the former C=C bond is highlighted in green) provide bi&#8208; and trifunctional 3&#8208;borylated pyrrolidines with diverse substitution patterns (including fused and spirocyclic ones) valuable for synthetic and medicinal chemistry. The background photo of a beautiful steep shore was taken at the locally well&#8208;recognized Stanislav canyon in the Kherson region, Ukraine. More information can be found in the Research Article by O.&#8197;O. Grygorenko and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202117). The invaluable help of Vladyslava Prykhodko with artwork preparation is appreciated.

         <title>Vibrational Circular Dichroism Unravels Supramolecular Chirality and Hydration Polymorphism of Nucleoside Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular VCD of nucleoside crystal solvomorphs: Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectra of guanosine microcrystals exhibit sign inversion upon reversible crystal hydration/dehydration. Such spectral changes occur due to alteration of molecular arrangement in the crystal. Supramolecular chirality of the crystals brings about two&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude enhancement of the VCD signal, thus enabling almost instantaneous spectra measurements. This could be utilized in pharmaceutical industry, e.&#8201;g. for quality and stability control.







Abstract
Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy has been widely used to study (bio)molecules in solution. However, its solid&#8208;state applications have been restricted due to experimental limitations and artifacts. Having overcome some of them, the first VCD study of nucleoside crystals is now presented. A two&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude enhancement of VCD signal was observed due to high molecular order in the crystals and resulting supramolecular chirality. This allowed to obtain high&#8208;quality VCD spectra within minutes using minute amounts of samples. The VCD technique is extremely sensitive in detecting changes in a crystal order and is able to distinguish different hydration states of crystals. This elevates it to a new level, as a fast and efficient tool to study chiral crystalline samples. This study demonstrates that VCD is capable of near&#8208;instantaneous detection of hydration polymorphs and crystal degradation, which is of substantial interest in pharmaceutical industry (quality and stability control).

         <title>Charge&#8208;Transfer Transitions Govern the Reactivity and Photophysics of Vicinally Diphosphanyl&#8208;Substituted Diborapentacenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction provides facile access to the ambipolar dihydrodiborapentacene P with two vicinal Ph2P substituents. Irradiation with visible light leads to a pronounced P&#8208;to&#8208;B charge transfer, which impacts the optoelectronic properties and reactivity of P and can in turn be modulated by Ph2P oxidation or transition&#8208;metal coordination.

2,3&#8208;Difluoro&#8208;5,14&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5,14&#8208;diborapentacene (DBP) was endowed with two vicinal Ph2P groups by an SNAr reaction at both CF sites using Ph2PSiMe3. Computations reveal the ambipolar product P to undergo P&#8208;to&#8208;B charge transfer under ambient light irradiation. Consequently, P is prone to photooxidation by air, yielding the Ph2P(O) species PO. With S8 or [Me3O][BF4], P furnishes the Ph2P(S) or Ph2P(Me)+ derivatives PS or [PMe][BF4]2. Along the series P, PO, PS, and [PMe][BF4]2, the redox potentials shift anodically from E1/2=&#8722;1.89&#8197;V to &#8722;1.02&#8197;V (CH2Cl2). Thus, derivatization of the Ph2P group allows late&#8208;stage modulation of the LUMO&#8208;energy level of the DBP. Derivatization also influences the emission properties of the compounds, as PO shows green (521&#8197;nm) and [PMe][BF4]2 red (622&#8197;nm) fluorescence in C6H6, while P and PS are dark. With CuBr and AgBr, P forms dimeric [M(&#956;&#8208;Br)]2 complexes [PCu]2 and [PAg]2, which show pronounced metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT), making P a promising ligand for photocatalysts.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integrating distinct unsaturated C&#8211;C systems while simultaneously installing metallic groups has been significantly challenging to execute in a multicomponent reaction. Therefore, designing a suitable mechanistic pathway that provides the required reactivity and selectivity for target C&#8211;C bonds with metallic reagents to ensure successful coupling is the key to success. Copper&#8208;catalyzed borylallylation and silylallylation have emerged as the most efficient strategies for assembling borylated/silylated skipped (1,4 or 1,5) dienes by catalytically combining an organocopper intermediate with allyl electrophiles. However, reactions involving interelemental reagents (e.g., [Si]&#8211;[B]) to accomplish intermolecular atom&#8208;economic couplings have not been studied thoroughly. Therefore, to aid the development of new transformations in this research area, we attempted to include all precedents, including our recent studies. The present Concept article may be extremely useful for researchers working in this area as it provides a strong conceptual framework.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence of a Dinuclear Platinum(II) Compound: Mechanism and Roles of an Upper Triplet State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A four&#8208;state (S0, S1, T1, and T2) model is proposed to rationalize the TADF behavior of a dinuclear Pt(II) compound and two up&#8208;conversion channels are found to contribute TADF at 300&#8197;K: the direct T1&#8594;S1 channel and the T2&#8208;mediated T1&#8594;T2&#8594;S1 one. Both channels contribute to TADF.







Abstract
A dinuclear Pt(II) compound was reported to exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF); however, the luminescence mechanism remains elusive. To reveal relevant excited&#8208;state properties and luminescence mechanism of this Pt(II) compound, both density function theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations were carried out in this work. In terms of the results, the S1 and T2 states show mixed intraligand charge transfer (ILCT)/metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand CT (MLCT) characters while the T1 state exhibits mixed ILCT/ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal CT (LMCT) characters. Mechanistically, a four&#8208;state (S0, S1, T1, and T2) model is proposed to rationalize the TADF behavior. The reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) process from the initial T1 to final S1 states involves two up&#8208;conversion channels (direct T1&#8594;S1 and T2&#8208;mediated T1&#8594;T2&#8594;S1 pathways) and both play crucial roles in TADF. At 300&#8197;K, these two channels are much faster than the T1 phosphorescence emission enabling TADF. However, at 80&#8197;K, these rISC rates are reduced by several orders of magnitude and become very small, which blocks the TADF emission; instead, only the phosphorescence is observed. These findings rationalize the experimental observation and could provide useful guidance to rational design of organometallic materials with superior TADF performances.

         <title>CH&#8208;&#960;&#160;Multi&#8208;Interaction&#8208;Driven Recognition and Isolation of Planar Compounds in a Spheroidal Polyaromatic Cavity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#960;&#8208;&#960; Interactions are established as a powerful supramolecular tool, whereas the usability of CH&#8208;&#960; interactions has been rather limited so far. Here we present (i) selective binding of planar polyaromatics and (ii) effective isolation of planar metal complexes by a polyaromatic capsule, utilizing multiple CH&#8208;&#960; interactions. In the spheroidal cavity, one molecule of large and medium&#8208;sized polyaromatic molecules (i.e., coronene and pyrene) is exclusively bound from mixtures bearing the same number of aromatic CH groups. Theoretical studies reveal that multiple host&#8208;guest CH&#8208;&#960; interactions (up to 32 interactions) are the predominant driving force for the observed selectivity. In addition, one molecule of planar metal complexes (i.e., porphine and bis(acetylacetonato) Cu(II) complexes) is quantitatively bound by the capsule through aromatic and aliphatic CH&#8208;&#960; multi&#8208;interactions, respectively. The ESR and theoretical studies demonstrate the isolation capability of the capsular framework and an unusual polar environment in the polyaromatic cavity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photochemical Macrocyclization Route to Asymmetric Strained [3.2]Paracyclophanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The intricate frameworks of paracyclophanes found in various chiral auxiliars, solar cells, high&#8208;performance plastics, pharmaceuticals, and molecular machines have become an important target for synthesis. Whereas numerous methods exist for the preparation of symmetric paracyclophanes, protocols for the efficient synthesis of strained asymmetric scaffolds are limited. Here we report a remarkable simple photochemical route to strained [3.2]paracyclophanes starting from readily available educts. By way of NMR and x&#8208;ray analyses, we discovered that UV&#8208;irradiation of an aromatic carboxylic ester tethered to a toluene moiety leads to the intramolecular formation of a new C&#8208;C bond, with loss of an alcohol. A systematic evaluation of the reaction conditions and substituents, as well as radical starter and triplet quenching experiments suggest a reaction mechanism involving an excited triplet state and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). The robust and versatile new method succeeded in the synthesis of range of cyclophanes with different substitutions, including an unusual diastereoisomer with two planar chiral centers and thus proved to be a valuable addition for the synthetic toolbox.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Auxiliary&#8208;mediated Native Chemical Ligation at Challenging Junctions with Pyridine Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To expand the scope of native chemical ligation (NCL) beyond reactions at cysteine, ligation auxiliaries are appended to the peptide N&#8208;terminus. We introduced the first pyridine&#8208;containing auxiliary which provided access to challenging junctions (proline or &#946;&#8208;branched amino acids). Probing the role of the pyridine ring nitrogen, we observed side reactions leading to preliminary auxiliary loss. Herein, we introduce a new, easy to attach &#946;&#8208;mercapto&#8208;&#946;&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinyl)&#8208;ethyl (MMPyE) auxiliary, which 1) has increased stability, 2) enables NCL at sterically encumbered junctions (e.g. Leu&#8208;Val) and 3) allows removal under mildly basic (pH 8.5) conditions. The synthesis of a 120 aa long peptide containing eight MUC5AC tandem repeats via ligation of two 60mers demonstrates the usefulness. Making use of hitherto unexplored NCL to tyrosine, the MMPyE auxiliary provided access to a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8208;cyclized 21&#8208;mer peptide and a His  6  &#8208;tagged hexaphosphorylated peptide comprising 6 heptapeptide repeats of the RNA polymerase II C&#8208;terminal domain.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A  meso&#8208;free  &#946;&#8208;bromodecaphyrin has been constructed by [2+3+2+3] type acid&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;condensation and subsequent oxidation. Hydrodebromination of this tetrabromodecaphyrin with NaBH4  in the presence of TMEDA and palladium catalyst afforded  &#946;&#8208;unsubstituted doubly  meso&#8208;free [46]decaphyrin(1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1) as the first example of  &#946;&#8208;unsubstituted  meso&#8208;free regular expanded porphyrins with the number of pyrrole units larger than eight. It exhibits distinct aromaticity originating from its 46&#960;&#8208;conjugated electronic circuit and flexible conformational change between non&#8208;twisted and doubly&#8208;twisted forms depending on the solvent&#8208;polarity. Their distinct conformations have been analyzed by combined experimental and theoretical investigations.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantiodivergent Chemoenzymatic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution: Conversion of Racemic Propargyl Alcohols into Both Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural lipases typically recognize enantiomers of alcohols based on size differences of substituents near the carbinol moiety and selectively react with (  R  )&#8208;enantiomers of secondary alcohols. Therefore, lipase&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of racemic secondary alcohols produces only (  R  )&#8208;enantiomers. We report herein a method for obtaining (  S  )&#8208;enantiomers by DKR of secondary 3&#8208;(trialkylsilyl)propargyl alcohols using a well&#8208;known (  R  )&#8208;selective  Pseudomonas fluorescens  lipase in combination with a racemization catalyst VMPS4, in which the silyl group reverses the size relationship of substituents near the carbinol moiety. Since we have already reported (  R  )&#8208;selective DKR of the corresponding propargyl alcohols without substituents on the ethynyl terminal carbon, the presence of an easily removable silyl group has enabled us to produce both enantiomers of propargyl alcohols in high chemical yields and with high enantiomeric excess. In addition, the immobilization of the lipase on Celite was found to be important for achieving the high efficiency of the DKR.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light mediated chemoselective transfer hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;aryl imino esters was demonstrated. The methodology has allowed the efficient and practical preparation of &#945;&#8208;amino acid esters. The mechanism of the reaction was probed by DFT calculations and deuteration experiments, indicated deuterium was introduced into amino acid esters efficiently (up to 99% D ratio), enabling a feasible way to obtain deuterated amino acids using D  2  O as a cheap deuterium source.</dc:description>

         <title>Observing Nearby Nuclei on Paramagnetic Trityls and MOFs via DNP and Electron Decoupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is an NMR sensitivity enhancement technique that mediates polarization transfer from unpaired electrons to NMR&#8208;active nuclei. Despite its success in elucidating important structural information on biological and inorganic materials, the detailed polarization&#8208;transfer pathway&#8212;from the electrons to the nearby and then the bulk solvent nuclei, and finally to the molecules of interest&#8212;remains unclear. In particular, the nuclei in the paramagnetic polarizing agent play significant roles in relaying the enhanced NMR polarizations to more remote nuclei. Despite their importance, the direct NMR observation of these nuclei is challenging because of poor sensitivity. Here, we show that a combined DNP and electron decoupling approach can enable direct NMR detection of these nuclei. We achieved an ~80% improvement in NMR intensity via electron decoupling at 0.35 T and 80 K on trityl radicals. Moreover, we recorded a DNP enhancement factor of &#120576; ~ 90 and ~11% higher NMR intensity using electron decoupling on paramagnetic metal&#8208;organic framework, magnesium hexaoxytriphenylene (MgHOTP MOF).</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
&#8220;The introduction of pseudo&#8208;meta PCPs into carbon&#8208;based macrocycles allowed us to obtain four enantiopure polygon&#8208;shaped structures in high yield, displaying unprecedented large molar circular dichroism values for all&#8208;carbon macrocycles and high absorption dissymmetry factors.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202201764).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue is the group of Marcel Mayor at the University of Basel with co&#8208;workers Olaf Fuhr and Dieter Fenske from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. The image depicts the studied all&#8208;carbon polygon shaped macrocycles along with their intense circular dichroism spectra in the background. The bright light within the macrocycles displays its efficient conjugation. Read the full text of the article at 10.1002/chem.202201764.

         <title>Phomoxanthone A Targets ATP Synthase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phomoxanthone A is a naturally occurring molecule and a powerful anti&#8208;cancer agent, although its mechanism of action is unknown. To facilitate the determination of its biological target(s) we used affinity&#8208;based labelling using a phomoxanthone A probe. Labelled proteins were pulled down, subjected to chemoproteomics analysis using LC&#8208;MS/MS and ATP synthase was identified as a likely target. Mitochondrial ATP synthase was validated in cultured cells lysates and in live intact cells. Our studies show sixty percent inhibition of ATP synthase by 260&#160; m M phomoxanthone A.</dc:description>

         <title>Trianionic 1,3,2&#8208;Dioxaborine&#8208;Containing Polymethines: Bright Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trianionic polymethines of the A&#8242;&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A&#8242; type comprising the dioxaborine rings (A) and different electron accepting end&#8208;groups (A&#8242;) were synthesized. The obtained dyes absorb and emit light in the near&#8208;infrared region with remarkably high molar attenuation coefficients (&#603;, up to 495&#8201;000 M&#8722;1cm&#8722;1  in DMF) and fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;f, up to 0.73 in DMF). Thus, the novel trianionic dyes take a stand among the brightest individual fluorophores known to date&#8212;with the magnitude of fluorescence brightness (&#603;&#8729;&#934;f) of 313&#8201;000 M&#8722;1cm&#8722;1  in DMF. The synthesized dyes demonstrate a minor negative solvatochromism and small Stokes shifts. The X&#8208;ray data reveal the nearly planar geometry of the trianionic chromophore. All the obtained compounds are stable in the solid state and in a solution, although the relative stability is much higher in polar aprotic than in protic solvents.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly active La(III)&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework as a heterogeneous Lewis acid catalyst for Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, a novel La(III)&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional (2&#8208;D) metal&#8208;organic framework, [La  2/3  (qptca)  1/2  ] (referred to as SLX&#8208;2), from LaCl  3  and 1,1':4',1'':4'',1''':4''',1''''&#8208;quinquephenyl]&#8208;2,2'',2'''',5''&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid (H  4  qptca) was synthesized by conventional solvothermal method and thoroughly characterized using X&#8208;ray single crystal diffraction, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analyses. The 2&#8208;D SLX&#8208;2 features a unique lanthanum center exposed to the skeleton and then was used as an efficient Lewis acid catalyst for the Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of indole and pyrrole with &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene along with a wide substrate scope, giving the desired products in good to high yields under the optimal reaction conditions. Furthermore, the catalyst was used for twenty cycles, with nearly no effect on its activity, and the reaction was heterogeneous in nature. Moreover, compared to the previous hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;donating MOF catalysts for such alkylation reactions, SLX&#8208;2 showed an excellent stability toward harsh acidic and basic environment, and gave comparable catalytic activities.</dc:description>

         <title>Bicomponent Cocatalyst Decoration on Flux&#8208;assisted CaTaO2N Single Crystals for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cubic&#8208;like CaTaO  2  N photocatalysts with high crystallinity and uniform particle size were successfully prepared by the flux&#8208;assisted nitridation method. The growth of CaTaO  2  N single crystals under different synthesis conditions was systematically investigated to understand the effects of the crystallinity and optical property on photocatalytic performance of CO  2  reduction. Moreover, the modification of CaTaO  2  N single crystals with core&#8208;shell Ni&#8208;Ag bicomponent cocatalyst by two&#8208;step decoration process exhibited higher rate of CO evolution than the deposition of sole Ag cocatalyst, because of the synergistic effects of bicomponent cocatalyst on the interfacial electron transfer and surface catalytic process. This study provides a valuable way to construct high&#8208;crystalline photocatalysts with effective bicomponent cocatalyst for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO  2  reduction with H  2  O.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrated reversible thermochromism, high Tc, dielectric switch and narrow band gap in one multifunctional ferroic</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic&#8208;inorganic Hybrid (OIH) materials for multifunctional switchable applications have attracted enormous attentions in recent years due to their excellent optoelectronic properties and good structural tunability. However, it still remains challenging to fabricate one simple OIH compound with multi&#8208;functionals properties, such as dielectric switching, thermochromic properties, semiconductor characteristics and ferroelasticity. Under this context, we successfully synthesized [2&#8208;(2&#8208;fluorophenyl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;amine]2SnBr6 (compound 1), which has a higher phase transition temperature of 427.7 K. Additionally, it exhibits a semiconducting property with an indirect band gap of 2.36 eV. Combining ferroelastic, narrow band gap, thermochromic, and dielectric properties, compound 1 can be considered as a rarely reported multi&#8208;functional ferroelastic material, which is expected to give inspiration for broadening the new applications in the multifunctional smart devices.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two regioselective, high&#8208;yielding one&#8208;pot routes to oxygen&#8208;bridged cyclic diaryliodonium salts and&#160;  ortho  &#8208;aryloxy&#8208;substituted acyclic diaryliodonium salts are presented. Starting from easily available&#160;  ortho  &#8208;iodo diaryl ethers, complete selectivity in formation of either the cyclic or acyclic product could be achieved by varying the reaction conditions. The complimentary reactivities of these novel ortho&#8208;oxygenated iodonium salts were demonstrated through a series of chemoselective arylations under metal&#8208;catalyzed and metal&#8208;free conditions, to deliver a range of novel,&#160;  ortho  &#8208;functionalized diaryl ether derivatives.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Spectroscopic and computational examination of a homologous series of rhodium(I) pybox carbonyl complexes has revealed a correlation between the conformation of the flanking aryl&#8208;substituted oxazoline donors and the carbonyl stretching frequency. This relationship is also observed experimentally for octahedral rhodium(III) and ruthenium(II) variants and cannot be explained through the classical, Dewar&#8211;Chatt&#8211;Duncanson, interpretation of metal&#8208;carbonyl bonding. Instead, these findings are reconciled by local changes in the magnitude of the electric field that is projected along the metal&#8208;carbonyl vector: the internal Stark effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Unprecedented Combination of Polyketide Natural Product Fragments Identifies the New Hedgehog Signaling Pathway Inhibitor Grismonone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pseudo&#8208;natural products (pseudo&#8208;NPs) are de novo combinations of natural product (NP) fragments that define novel bioactive chemotypes. For their discovery, new design principles are being sought. Previously, pseudo&#8208;NPs were synthesized by the combination of fragments originating from biosynthetically unrelated NPs to guarantee structural novelty and novel bioactivity. We report the combination of fragments from biosynthetically related NP in novel arrangements to yield a novel chemotype with activity not shared by the guiding fragments. We describe the synthesis of the polyketide pseudo&#8208;NP grismonone and identify it as a structurally novel and potent inhibitor of Hedgehog signalling. The insight that the de novo combination of fragments derived from biosynthetically related NPs also may yield new biologically relevant compound classes with unexpected bioactivity may be considered a chemical extension or diversion of existing biosynthetic pathways and greatly expands the opportunities for exploration of biologically relevant chemical space by means of the pseudo&#8208;NP principle.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Strategies for Dendritic Magneto&#8208;Plasmonic Nanostructures Applied to Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical analyses in the field using surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) protocols are expected to be part of several analytical procedures applied to water quality monitoring. To date, these endeavors have been supported by developments on SERS substrate nanofabrication, instrumentation portability and the internet of things. Here, we report distinct chemical strategies for preparing magneto&#8208;plasmonic (Fe  3  O  4  :Au) colloids, which are relevant in the context of trace level detection of water contaminants due to their inherent multifunctionality. The main objective of this research is to investigate the role of poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (PAMAM) in the preparation of SERS substrates integrating both functionalities in single nanostructures. Three chemical routes have been investigated to design magneto&#8208;plasmonic nanostructures which translate into different ways for assessing SERS detection using distinct interfaces. Hence, a series of magneto&#8208;plasmonic colloids have been characterized and then assessed for their SERS activity by using a model pesticide (thiram) dissolved in aqueous samples.</dc:description>

         <title>Evolution of a Synthetic Strategy for Garsubellin A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Garsubellin A is a thirty&#8208;carbon meroterpenoid capable of enhancing the enzyme choline acetyltransferase whose decreased level is associated with the symptoms of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. Due to the potentially useful biological activity along with the novel molecular architecture, this plant metabolite has remained a popular synthetic target. Herein we report a full account of our synthetic investigations that have led to the enantioselective total synthesis of garsubellin A, establishing its absolute stereostructure. The protecting group&#8208;free, twelve&#8208;step synthetic route has enabled the syntheses of the natural (&#8211;)&#8208;garsubellin A and its unnatural (+)&#8208;antipode.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Mechanistic Aspects on [3 + 2]&#160;Cycloaddition Reactions of Azides to Nitroolefins: A Computational and Kinetic Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>[3+2] cycloadditions of nitroolefins have emerged as a selective and catalyst&#8208;free alternative for the synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles from azides. We describe mechanistic studies into the cycloaddition/rearomatization reaction sequence. DFT calculations revealed a rate&#8208;limiting cycloaddition step proceeding via an asynchronous TS with high kinetic selectivity for the 1,5&#8208;triazole. Kinetic studies reveal a second&#8208;order rate law, and  13  C kinetic isotopic effects at natural abundance were measured with a significant normal effect at the conjugated olefinic centers of 1.0158 and 1.0216 at the &#945; and &#946;&#8208;carbons of &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene. Distortion/interaction&#8208;activation strain and energy decomposition analyses revealed that the major regioisomeric pathway benefits from an earlier and less&#8208;distorted TS, while intermolecular interaction terms dominate the preference for 1,5&#8208; over 1,4&#8208;cycloadducts. In addition, the major regioisomer also has more favorable electrostatic and dispersion terms. Additionally, while static DFT calculations suggest a concerted but highly asynchronous  Ei  &#8208;type HNO  2  elimination mechanism, quasiclassical direct&#8208;dynamics calculations reveal the existence of a dynamic intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Architecture of an Amphiphilic Amino Alcohol as a Versatile Chiral Environment for Stereocontrolled Photoreaction of Various Anthracenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular architecture of an amphiphilic amino alcohol serves as unprecedentedly versatile chiral environment, which can efficiently control the stereochemistry of the self&#8208;photocyclodimerization of various anthracenes (71&#8211;98&#8201;% regio ratio, 76&#8211;86&#8201;% ee) as well as the cross&#8208;photocyclodimerization between two anthracenes (58&#8201;% chemo ratio, 83&#8201;% regio ratio, 90&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
The photocyclodimerization of 2&#8208;anthracenecarboxylic acid has been extensively studied as a model reaction of asymmetric photochemistry. So far, numerous chiral environments have been employed to control this photoreaction, while the scope of photoreactants has been limited only to 2&#8208;anthracenecarboxylic acid and its simple esters and amides. Here, we developed a systematic series of photoreactants (2&#8201;a&#8211;d) by introducing various substituents to 2&#8208;anthracenecarboxylic acid, which showed different reactivities and selectivities depending on the substituents. By using the photoreactants 2&#8201;a&#8211;d, we evaluated the performance of a chiral environment composed of an amphiphilic amino alcohol (1), where the photocyclodimerization of 2&#8201;a&#8211;d generally proceeded in excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities (71&#8211;98&#8201;% regio ratio, 76&#8211;86&#8201;% ee). Furthermore, by reacting 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b together in the chiral environment of 1, we succeeded in the first stereocontrolled cross&#8208;photocyclodimerization between two prochiral anthracenes (58&#8201;% chemo ratio, 83&#8201;% regio ratio, 90&#8201;% ee).

         <title>Unravelling the Role of the Pentafluoroorthotellurate Group as a Ligand in Nickel Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The homoleptic [Ni(OTeF5)4]2&#8722; anion has been selectively prepared and arises as an analogue of [NiF4]2&#8722;, but featuring the discrete tetrahedral geometry of the heavier halonickelates. This high&#8208;spin complex has enabled the investigation of the electronic properties of the [OTeF5]&#8722; group in coordination chemistry, showing that it behaves as the fluoride also in ligand&#8208;field terms.







Abstract
The pentafluoroorthotellurate group (teflate, OTeF5) is able to form species, for which only the fluoride analogues are known. Despite nickel fluorides being widely investigated, nickel teflates have remained elusive for decades. By reaction of [NiCl4]2&#8722; and neat ClOTeF5, we have synthesized the homoleptic [Ni(OTeF5)4]2&#8722; anion, which presents a distorted tetrahedral structure, unlike the polymeric [NiF4]2&#8722;. This high&#8208;spin complex has allowed the study of the electronic properties of the teflate group, which can be classified as a weak/medium&#8208;field ligand, and therefore behaves as the fluoride analogue also in ligand&#8208;field terms. The teflate ligands in [NEt4]2[Ni(OTeF5)4] are easily substituted, as shown by the formation of [Ni(NCMe)6][OTeF5]2 by dissolving it in acetonitrile. Nevertheless, careful reactions with other conventional ligands have enabled the crystallization of nickel teflate complexes with different coordination geometries, i.e. [NEt4]2[trans&#8208;Ni(OEt2)2(OTeF5)4] or [NEt4][Ni(bpyMe2)(OTeF5)3].

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Olefin Metathesis: Recent Theoretical and Experimental Advances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;catalyzed olefin metathesis is high on the list of existing challenges in chemistry. Iron is one of the most abundant elements in the earth&#8216;s crust, and, therefore, iron catalysts would offer highly attractive alternatives to Ru&#8208; and Mo&#8208;based catalysts. This Review summarizes the key recent theoretical and experimental advances towards the development of iron&#8208;catalyzed olefin metathesis.







Abstract
The &#8220;metathesis reaction&#8221; is a straightforward and often metal&#8208;catalyzed chemical reaction that transforms two hydrocarbon molecules to two new hydrocarbons by exchange of molecular fragments. Alkane, alkene and alkyne metathesis have become an important tool in synthetic chemistry and have provided access to complex organic structures. Since the discovery of industrial olefin metathesis in the 1960s, many modifications have been reported; thus, increasing scope and improving reaction selectivity. Olefin metathesis catalysts based on high&#8208;valent group six elements or Ru(IV) have been developed and improved through ligand modifications. In addition, significant effort was invested to realize olefin metathesis with a non&#8208;toxic, bio&#8208;compatible and one of the most abundant elements in the earth&#8242;s crust; namely, iron. First evidences suggest that low&#8208;valent Fe(II) complexes are active in olefin metathesis. Although the latter has not been unambiguously established, this review summarizes the key advances in the field and aims to guide through the challenges.

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;based Photochromic Delivery Vehicles for Ions and Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azobenzene&#8208;based supramolecular photochromic scaffold for the light&#8208;controlled binding and release of the guest molecules such as anions, cations, and neutral molecules have been demonstrated. These smart photochromic&#8208;hosts display light&#8208;induced change in molecular recognition and thus can act as the light&#8208;driven delivery vehicle for the external analytes.







Abstract
Molecular switches have been used as delivery vehicles for various molecular and ionic species. The ones that reversibly operate with light are arguably the best candidates for the purpose as they can be operated using light. The two states of these photoswitchable systems often possess remarkable differences in terms of their structural features and electronic properties. Photochromic systems with the appropriate embellishment of functionalities at suitable positions have thus been used as photoresponsive receptors. The use of light&#8208;driven alterations of the structural features has led to differential molecular recognition with these switchable host molecules. In this article, we discuss the use of such supramolecular systems as the delivery vehicles for ions and molecules that started with the pioneering work by Shinkai back in 1979. This review will explicitly cover the development from 2001 to 2022 with some past background and the future prospects of the field.

         <title>Dehydrocoupling Polymerization: Poly(silylether) Synthesis by Using an Iron &#946;&#8208;Diketiminate Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient iron catalyzed method for the formation of poly(silylether)s has been developed, where the only by&#8208;product of the reaction is hydrogen gas. Fourteen different polymers have been prepared, which show a range of different thermal properties. Insight into the reaction, which proceeds via a condensation polymerization mechanism is provided.







Abstract
We describe the iron&#8208;catalyzed polymerizations of diol and silane monomers to obtain fourteen different poly(silylether) products with number average molecular weights (Mn) up to 36.3&#8197;kDa. The polymerization reactions developed in this study are operationally simple and applicable to 1&#176; and 2&#176; silane monomer substrates and a range of benzylic and aliphatic diol substrates as well as one polyol example. The polymers were characterized by IR spectroscopy, DSC and TGA and, where solubility allowed, 1H, 13C{1H}, 29Si{1H} NMR spectroscopies, GPC and MALDI&#8208;TOF were also employed. The materials obtained displayed low Tg values (&#8722;70.6 to 19.1&#8201;&#176;C) and were stable upon heating up to T&#8211;5%,Ar 421.6&#8201;&#176;C. A trend in T&#8211;5%,Ar was observed whereby use of a 2&#176; silane leads to higher T&#8211;5%,Ar compared to those obtained using a 1&#176; silane. Reaction monitoring was undertaken by in situ gas evolution studies coupled with GPC analysis to follow the progression of chain&#8208;length growth which confirmed a condensation polymerization&#8208;type mechanism.

         <title>Hydrophilic Chitosan Derivatives: Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature&#8208;sourced polymer alternatives have attracted increasing attention for applications in medicine, cosmetics, agriculture, food, water purification, and more. Among those, chitosan, is the most versatile due to its full biodegradability, exceptional biocompatibility, multipurpose bioactivity, and low toxicity. Although remarkable progress has been made regarding its synthetic modifications using C3/C6 secondary/primary hydroxyl (&#8208;OH) and the C2 amino (&#8208;NH2) active sites, its solubility under physiological conditions remained limited and hampered larger&#8208;scale adoption. This minireview summarizes different synthetic methods that increase chitosan's hydrophilicity and water solubility using covalent modifications, namely, amino acid addition, quaternary ammonium formation, phosphorylation, and carboxymethylation. We also reviewed several applications for each type of substitution in fields such as cosmetics, medicine, agriculture, water purification etc., and provided an outlook and perspective for future modifications and implementations.</dc:description>

         <title>Labile Base&#8208;Stabilized Silyliumylidene Ions. Non&#8208;Metallic Species Capable of Activating Multiple Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Various base&#8208;stabilized silyliumylidene ions with different ligands were synthesized. Their behaviour appeared strongly dependent on the type of ligand. Indeed, in contrast to the poorly reactive silyliumylidenes stabilized by strongly donating ligands (DMAP, NHC), the sulfide&#8208;supported one (SMe  2  ) exhibits higher reactivity toward various small molecules. Furthermore, their capability to successively activate multiple small molecules was clearly demonstrated by processes involving successive reactions with silane / formamide, CO  2  and H  2  . Of particular interest, the silyliumylidene&#8208;silylene complex is one of the very rare species able to activate two H  2  molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Capturing a Pentacyclic Fragment&#8208;Based Library Derived from Perophoramidine: Their Design, Synthesis and Evaluation as Anticancer Compounds by DNA Double&#8208;Strand Breaks (DSB) and PARP&#8208;1 Inhibition</title>

A Pentacyclic fragment inspired from Perophoramidine. Natural product inspired PARP inhibitor.







Abstract
Herein we have reported the discovery of a pentacyclic building block comprised of fused indole&#8208;quinoline and piperidinone from the natural product perophoramidine as a formidable anticancer agent. The compounds were synthesized in six steps where the key steps involved a blue LED mediated intramolecular cyclopropanation of the indole intermediates and concomitant reduction of the associated aryl nitro moiety to nitroso in the molecule. Cytotoxicity screening of the compounds against an array of cancer cells that is, MCF7, HCT116 and A549 demonstrated 0.6 to 9&#8197;&#956;M IC50s by few of the compounds. &#947;H2AX immunofluorescence assay of the two most potent molecules from the phenotypic screening with anti&#8208;&#947;&#8208;H2AX Alexa Fluor 488 antibody revealed extensive DNA damage of the A549 cells which indicated probable PARP inhibition (similar to Perophoramidine). Through molecular docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation studies the binding efficiency of our compounds with poly(ADP&#8208;ribose)polymerase 1 (PARP 1) enzyme was determined. Chemiluminescent PARP Assay with Histone&#8208;coated strips indicated that the most active compounds from the phenotypic screening induced PARP&#8208;1 inhibition with IC50s of 1.3&#8594;1.5&#8197;&#956;M.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Arylfluorination of Alkenes: A Powerful New Approach to Organofluorine Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multitasking: One of the newly developed methods for accessing organofluorine compounds is Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylfluorination, which simultaneously introduces an aryl group and a fluorine atom into an olefin framework. This review provides a concise overview of this powerful and versatile method.







Abstract
Fluorine incorporation into organic molecules is often beneficial to their absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties or bioactivity. As a consequence, organofluorine compounds have become quite common amongst drugs and agrochemicals, and their preparation is a highly important topic in both synthetic organic chemistry and pharmaceutical chemistry. One of the newly developed methods for accessing organofluorine compounds is Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylfluorination of alkenes. It is an olefin difunctionalization process that simultaneously introduces an aryl group and a fluorine atom into an alkene framework. This review provides a concise overview of this powerful and versatile method.

         <title>Free Aluminylenes: An Emerging Class of Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbene analogues: Free aluminylenes and mono&#8208;base&#8208;stabilized aluminylenes are extremely reactive species. The ambiphilicity of these species allows facile activation of inert chemical bonds as well as coordination to transition metals in diverse modes. Free aluminylenes are potent synthons for unusual aluminium species.







Abstract
Aluminylenes (R&#8722;Al) are aluminium analogs of carbenes. In contrast to isolable carbenes, aluminylenes are extremely rare species. In the past years, pioneered by Schn&#246;ckel, Roesky and Power, a few free aluminylenes and their complexes have been reported. Such compounds have the aluminium atom in the oxidation state +I, which contrasts with classical organoaluminium derivatives that contain the element in the +III oxidation state. Aluminylenes, either in their free state or in the coordination sphere of a Lewis base, are capable of coordinating to transition metals and activating inert chemical bonds. Free aluminylenes are emerging as potent synthetic platforms for unusual aluminium species.

         <title>Dioxygen Activation by Redox&#8208;Active Bis(aldimine) Ligand Bridged Diruthenium Complex Possessing Singlet Ground State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand&#8208;centered dioxygen activation and oxygenation of bis(aldimine) core have been highlighted on a dinuclear Ru platform utilizing the concept of spin isomerism at the redox&#8208;active metal&#8208;ligand interface. Authentication of the complexes along with the redox non&#8208;innocence behavior of their bridge have been validated through structure, spectroelectrochemistry, and DFT calculations.







Abstract
The unexplored &#8216;actor&#8217; behavior of redox&#8208;active bis(aldimine) congener, p&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bis(picoline)aldimine (L1), towards dioxygen activation and subsequent functionalization of its backbone was demonstrated on coordination with {Ru(acac)2} (acac= acetylacetonate). Reaction under aerobic condition led to the one&#8208;pot generation of dinuclear complexes with unperturbed L1, imino&#8208;carboxamido (L2&#8722;), and bis(carboxamido) (L32&#8722;)&#8208;bridged isovalent {RuII(&#956;&#8208;L1)RuII}, 1/ {RuIII(&#956;&#8208;L32&#8722;)RuIII}, 3 and mixed&#8208;valent {RuII(&#956;&#8208;L2&#8722;)RuIII}, 2. Authentication of the complexes along with the redox non&#8208;innocence behavior of their bridge have been validated through structure, spectroelectrochemistry and DFT calculations. Kinetic and isotope labelling experiments together with DFT analyzed transition states justified the consideration of redox shuttling at metal/L1 interface for 3O2 activation despite of the closed shell configuration of 1 (S=0) to give carboxamido derived 2/3.

         <title>Bismuth gadolinium oxychloride with a remarkable visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive O2 evolution activity promoted by iodine doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive bismuth&#8208;based oxyhalide has recently attracted extensive attention, however, the promotion of its charge separation is still challenging. Herein, we introduce iodine into Bi2GdO4Cl to synthetize I&#8208;doped Bi2GdO4Cl (denoted as yI&#8208;Bi2GdO4Cl, 0&#8804;y&#8804;2).   The incorporation of I&#8208;  ions is found to enhance light absorption and to accelerate charge separation by combining various characterizations such as density functional theory calculation, photoelectrochemical test, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectrum, and open&#8208;circuit voltage decay.  The O2&#8208;evolving performances of 1I&#8208;Bi2GdO4Cl with optimized dopant concentration of I&#8208;  ion and the IrO2  loaded 1I&#8208;Bi2GdO4Cl are tremendously promoted by  ca.  4 and 45 times compared with pristine Bi2GdO4Cl. Notably, The O2  evolution rate reaches as high as 154.8 &#956;mol&#183;h&#8208;1  with an apparent quantum efficiency of ~1.1% at 420 nm.  The synthetic iodine&#8208;doped photocatalyst remains stability after long&#8208;term photoreaction, demonstrating its potential  in the field of photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Two Tags in One Probe: Combining Fluorescence&#8208; and Biotin&#8208;based Detection of the Trypanosomal Cysteine Protease Rhodesain</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly potent, bimodal activity&#8208;based probe for the therapeutically relevant cysteine protease rhodesain was developed. We utilized two different access points at the coumarin fluorophore for incorporation of the rhodesain inhibitor part and the biotin affinity label. The two reporter tags were employed for on&#8208;blot chemiluminescence detection and affinity purification as well as post&#8208;labeling quantification of the target protein by size exclusion chromatography with fluorescence detection.







Abstract
Rhodesain is the major cysteine protease of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei and a therapeutic target for sleeping sickness, a fatal neglected tropical disease. We designed, synthesized and characterized a bimodal activity&#8208;based probe that binds to and inactivates rhodesain. This probe exhibited an irreversible mode of action and extraordinary potency for the target protease with a kinac/Ki value of 37,000&#8197;M&#8722;1s&#8722;1. Two reporter tags, a fluorescent coumarin moiety and a biotin affinity label, were incorporated into the probe and enabled highly sensitive detection of rhodesain in a complex proteome by in&#8208;gel fluorescence and on&#8208;blot chemiluminescence. Furthermore, the probe was employed for microseparation and quantification of rhodesain and for inhibitor screening using a competition assay. The developed bimodal rhodesain probe represents a new proteomic tool for studying Trypanosoma pathobiochemistry and antitrypanosomal drug discovery.
