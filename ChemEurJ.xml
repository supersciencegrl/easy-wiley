         <title>Characterising Side Chain Conformations in Proteins Using 19F&#8208;ENDOR and New Fluorinated Amino Acid Spin Labels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
19F&#8208;ENDOR combined with fluorinated tagging strategies is used to determine the dominant conformation of these side chains in metalloproteins and spin&#8208;labelled proteins.








Abstract
It has recently been shown that distances &gt; 20&#160;&#197; can be measured between Gd3+ spin tags and 19F labels in proteins using 19F&#8208;ENDOR at 94&#160;GHz. Here we examine the precision with which this method can locate the positions of (aromatic) amino acid side chains and, with the help of established simulation tools, determine the conformational space sampled by solvent&#8208;exposed chains in solution. First, using a novel set of fluorinated phenylalanine amino acids incorporated into the metalloprotein Calbindin D9k binding Gd3+, we show that triangulation of the corresponding 19F&#8208;ENDOR determined distances&#160;can precisely identify the conformation of buried side chains. The obtained conformation agrees with the same (single) orientation seen in the crystal structure of the native protein. In a second set of proteins labeled with a Gd3+ spin tag and noncanonical 19F&#8208;labeled amino acids, the splittings, lineshapes, and integrated intensities of the 19F&#8208;ENDOR signals were used to constrain the conformational space of the side chains initially identified by comprehensive rotamer simulations. This work provides the first example where 19F&#8208;ENDOR constraints have been used to accurately pinpoint side chain conformations in a protein with the help of differently fluorinated amino acids.

         <title>Lamellar&#8208;Cleavage&#8208;Induced Triboluminescence in Discrete Chiral Complexes with Lanthanides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TL mechanism of chiral lanthanide complexes induced by the DTS that provided a mechanical stimulus was elucidated using structural and spectral measurements. The lamellar molecular aggregation was cleaved, and TL was accelerated by the excitation of the ligand acting as an energy donor to the ff emission of Eu, Tb, Sm, and Dy through energy transfer. The ligand&#8208;centered TL of GdLval strongly support the mechanism.








Abstract
Triboluminescence (TL), which is the light emission induced by mechanical stimuli, has attracted significant interest owing to its potential for energy conversion applications. Here, the TL mechanisms of chiral lanthanide complexes (LnLval, Ln&#160;=&#160;Eu, Tb, Sm, Dy, and Gd) were elucidated by focusing on the role of lamellar cleavage of the crystal structure. The modified drop tower system (DTS) quantifies mechanical stimuli used to observe the TL spectra. Chiral EuLval and TbLval exhibit intense TL, in contrast to the absence of TL in their racemic counterparts. Structural analyses revealed lamella&#8208;like molecular stacking in the chiral crystals with anisotropic molecular orientations and flexibility along the c&#8208;axis. TL was reversibly observed by recrystallization when the crystal size was sufficiently large. Comparison of the TL and photoluminescence (PL) spectra, showed that TL of chiral LnLval was enhanced through photo&#8208;antenna effects by the impact of lamellar cleavage. The TL values of the chiral Dy and Sm complexes were also evaluated. Furthermore, the absence of chemical reaction of the two nitrate ions with neighboring molecules in the lamella was confirmed. This system suggests the importance of the lamellar arrangement and provides potential design strategies for mechano&#8208;responsive materials for TL activation of Ln complexes.

         <title>Regioselective Functionalization of Propargyl Amines via Electrochemically Generated Alkynyl Iminium Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical oxidation of propargyl amines affords alkynyl iminium cation species, which undergo regioselective nucleophilic addition to yield the corresponding N&#8208;&#945; substituted propargyl amines. Additionally, an unprecedented enaminal formation was observed in the presence of water, providing functionalized aldehydes in a single step.

         <title>PtNi Nanowires Coated with Amorphous FeOx Enable Robust Alkaline Seawater Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a PtNi nanowire with an amorphous FeOx layer achieves exceptional seawater hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance (81&#160;mV @ 100&#160;mA cm&#160;&#8722;&#160;2). The FeOx provides atomic&#8208;level corrosion protection by dual function: promoting H&#8314; adsorption while blocking Cl&#8722;, enabling seawater stability.








Abstract
Promoting water dissociation kinetics while overcoming the severe chloride&#8208;induced degradation of platinum (Pt)&#8208;based catalysts is critical for practical seawater hydrogen evolution, yet remain significant challenges. Herein, we report amorphous FeOx&#8208; coated PtNi nanowires (NWs) (PtNi@FeOx) featuring an atomic&#8208;scale amorphous shell&#8208;crystalline core heterointerface, which deliver outstanding alkaline seawater electrolysis performance. The PtNi@FeOx catalyst surpasses conventional Pt&#8208;based materials, demonstrates overpotentials as low as 30&#160;mV (10&#160;mA cm&#160;&#8722;&#160;2) and 81&#160;mV (100&#160;mA cm&#160;&#8722;&#160;2), and exhibits excellent endurance of 100&#160;h at 100&#160;mA cm&#160;&#8722;&#160;2. Theory of density functional calculations reveal that the synergistic amorphous/crystalline heterointerface accelerates water splitting kinetics while modulating hydrogen adsorption energetics at active centers, thereby reducing the reaction energy landscape. Moreover, the ultrathin amorphous FeOx layer selectively facilitates H intermediate adsorption while effectively repelling chloride ions, thus significantly enhancing catalyst stability under complex seawater conditions. This work provides a promising atomically interface&#8208;engineering strategy for designing electrocatalyst toward highly efficient and robust large&#8208;scale seawater electrolysis.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Function Relationships of Heparan Sulfate&#8208;Based Neoproteoglycans as Selective Immunostimulatory Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first evidence that synthetic heparan sulfate (HS)&#8208;based neoproteoglycans can modulate immune responses, underscoring the critical influence of sulfation patterns and uronic acid composition on cytokine secretion.








Abstract
Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) play a critical role in regulating inflammatory responses. Their diverse functions arise from the distinct structural heterogeneity of heparan sulfate (HS) side chains. Deciphering these structural determinants offers a promising strategy for developing novel vaccine adjuvants and immunotherapeutic agents. Herein, we evaluated a panel of neoproteoglycans (neoPGs) functionalized with structurally defined HS oligosaccharides to identify ligands that selectively trigger cytokine responses in immune cells. Our results demonstrate that highly sulfated, L&#8208;iduronic acid&#8208;containing, N&#8208;sulfated HS&#8208;conjugated neoPGs, specifically H7 and H12 induced pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines TNF&#8208;&#945;, IL&#8208;1&#946;, and IL&#8208;6 in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), compared to their D&#8208;glucuronic acid analogs. Notably, cotreatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) did not result in a synergistic increase in cytokine levels, indicating that these HS neoPGs likely activate immune signaling independently of the LPS&#8208;mediated pathway. In contrast, similar experiments with murine macrophage cell line PMJ2&#8208;PC showed only modest cytokine induction, particularly with the H6 ligand, further supporting a cell&#8208;type specific and Toll&#8208;like receptor (TLR) independent mechanism of action.

     alt="Structure-Function Relationships of Heparan Sulfate-Based Neoproteoglycans as Selective Immunostimulatory Scaffolds"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the first evidence that synthetic heparan sulfate (HS)-based neoproteoglycans can modulate immune responses, underscoring the critical influence of sulfation patterns and uronic acid composition on cytokine secretion.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) play a critical role in regulating inflammatory responses. Their diverse functions arise from the distinct structural heterogeneity of heparan sulfate (HS) side chains. Deciphering these structural determinants offers a promising strategy for developing novel vaccine adjuvants and immunotherapeutic agents. Herein, we evaluated a panel of neoproteoglycans (neoPGs) functionalized with structurally defined HS oligosaccharides to identify ligands that selectively trigger cytokine responses in immune cells. Our results demonstrate that highly sulfated, L-iduronic acid-containing, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-sulfated HS-conjugated neoPGs, specifically &lt;b&gt;H7&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;H12&lt;/b&gt; induced pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-&#945;, IL-1&#946;, and IL-6 in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), compared to their D-glucuronic acid analogs. Notably, cotreatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) did not result in a synergistic increase in cytokine levels, indicating that these HS neoPGs likely activate immune signaling independently of the LPS-mediated pathway. In contrast, similar experiments with murine macrophage cell line PMJ2-PC showed only modest cytokine induction, particularly with the &lt;b&gt;H6&lt;/b&gt; ligand, further supporting a cell-type specific and Toll-like receptor (TLR) independent mechanism of action. Collectively, these data identify structurally distinct HS domains that can function as cell-specific immunomodulators, offering new opportunities for the rational design of glycan-based adjuvants and therapeutic immune regulators.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal Nanoclusters Catalyzing Organic Transformations&#8208;Synergistic Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept highlights recent progress of the synergistic effect of metal nanoclusters in catalyzing organic transformations. Construction of metal&#8208;metal and metal&#8208;ligand synergistic activation sites for catalysis are introduced, respectively, providing a new perspective on the rational design of metal nanocluster catalysts and activity/selectivity control in organic transformations.








Abstract
Metal nanoclusters consist of an ultra&#8208;small metal kernel and organic ligands on the surface. They possess diversified metal&#8208;ligand coordination modes and generally display catalytic properties that are distinct from those of the homogeneous and heterogeneous metal catalysts, thus offering considerable potential for application in the field of catalytic organic transformations. Moreover, metal nanoclusters have well&#8208;defined compositions and atomically precise structures, which are beneficial for revealing the relationship between structures and catalytic performance. Therefore, metal nanoclusters have been employed as a model catalyst to ascertain the synergistic activation sites and to investigate the catalytic reaction mechanism from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. This review focuses on the synergistic catalysis of metal nanoclusters in organic transformations. We discuss two aspects of this topic: i) construction of metal&#8208;metal synergistic activation sites for catalysis; ii) construction of metal&#8208;ligand synergistic activation sites for catalysis. The summary and outlook concerning future opportunities of metal nanocluster in catalyzing organic transformations are presented at the end.

Find the path! The present paper points out the potentialities of chemometrics tools to design selective BF3&#183;OEt2 catalyzed procedures for the preparation of &#916;&#8313;&#8208;THC, &#916;&#8312;&#8208;THC, &#916;&#8312;&#8208;iso&#8208;THC, &#916;&#8308;&#8208;iso&#8208;THC, &#916;&#8308;(&#8312;)&#8208;iso&#8208;THC, by simply tuning the initial concentration of CBD, the amount of the Lewis acid, the reaction time as well as the nature of the solvent employed.








Abstract
The acid&#8208;catalyzed conversion of cannabidiol (CBD) to tetrahydrocannabinol and iso&#8208;tetrahydrocannabinol derivatives is a well&#8208;established synthetic strategy. However, since the reaction outcome is strongly dependent on the conditions, a careful investigation is always required to achieve the optimal chemoselectivity. Chemometrics recently emerged as an effective approach for improving synthetic methods, especially when multiple parameters are involved. The present paper aims to apply chemometrics tools to the optimization of the procedures for the preparation of &#916;&#8313;&#8208;THC, &#916;&#8312;&#8208;THC, &#916;&#8312;&#8208;iso&#8208;THC, &#916;&#8308;&#8208;iso&#8208;THC, and &#916;&#8308;(&#8312;)&#8208;iso&#8208;THC. All the reactions have been performed at room temperature by tuning the initial concentration of CBD, the equivalents of the model Lewis acid considered (BF3&#183;OEt2), the reaction time, and the nature of the media to achieve the desired products. The kinetics of the process, followed over the course of 1 to 48 hours, were analyzed by means of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to initially simplify the multidimensional dataset and help identify the best media for &#916;&#8313;&#8208;THC and &#916;&#8312;&#8208;THC. In order to optimize the conditions needed for &#916;&#8308;&#8208;iso&#8208;THC, &#916;&#8308;(&#8312;)&#8208;iso&#8208;THC, and &#916;&#8312;&#8208;iso&#8208;THC, multiple Design of Experiment (DoE) were employed, leading to the successful isolation of the target compounds. During the investigation, cannabinoid derivatives incorporating a portion of the reaction medium were also identified.

         <title>AND&#8208;Gated Multipedal 3D DNA Walker Enables Rapid Dual MicroRNA Imaging and Accurate Cancer Discrimination in Cells and Tissues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an AND&#8208;gated multipedal 3D DNA walker (AMTW) for simultaneous imaging of miR&#8208;21 and miR&#8208;155 in living cells and clinical tissues. The AND&#8208;gated design ensures that only the presence of both target miRNAs activates the walker, generating amplified fluorescence signals with accelerated kinetics for highly specific cancer discrimination.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time monitoring of intracellular microRNA expression is crucial for disease diagnosis, yet existing DNA walker&#8208;based detection methods suffer from insufficient specificity and limited reaction efficiency for reliable cancer identification. Herein, we present an AND&#8208;gated multipedal 3D DNA walker (AMTW) for simultaneous imaging of miR&#8208;21 and miR&#8208;155 expression in live cells and clinical tissues. The presence of target miRNAs activates the AND&#8208;gated operation, triggering the walking process and generating amplified fluorescence signals. AMTW achieves a detection limit of 2.79 pM and exhibits higher initial reaction rates than bipedal and monopedal walkers (4.38&#8208;fold and 8.73&#8208;fold increases, respectively). Moreover, the system effectively discriminates between tumor and normal samples at both cellular and tissue levels. Collectively, AMTW advances intracellular miRNA detection by integrating logic&#8208;gated recognition with enhanced collision efficiency, providing a robust platform for precise cancer diagnostics and early disease identification in clinical applications.

Abstract
The discovery of multi&#8208;principal metal materials has gained enormous interest due to their exceptional properties. The combination of five or more metals in one single phase results in synthesizing a material commonly known as high Entropy material (HEM). These materials have exquisite mechanical and catalytic properties owing to unique metallic combinations. The optical properties of various HEM have recently surfaced with exceptional bandgap tunability ranging from the visible to the infrared wavelength spectrum. These optical properties have attracted material scientists to address the current efficiency bottlenecking from bi&#8208; or tri&#8208;metallic systems. In the quest to deliver efficient performance via High Entropy (HE) configuration, various types of nanostructures are also reported. The major portion of these newly emerged nanostructure categories is comprised of HE&#8208;MXene, HE&#8208;layered hydroxide, and HE&#8208;alloy nanoparticles. Dwelling in these structures for photothermal and photocatalysis are two major interests that have attracted many scientific explorers. There are numerous reviews dedicated to their hardness, toughness, structure, and electrocatalytic properties; a review compiling photo&#8208;stimulated/active properties was missing. This review is dedicated to new classes of HE configuration and their role in photo&#8208;stimulated studies. The major areas of interest are photoabsorbers, photothermal, photodetectors, photoemitters, photocatalysis, and photochromic materials.

         <title>Discovery of a Potent Lysine&#8208;Specific Histone Demethylase&#8208;1 (LSD&#8208;1) Inhibitor for Cancer Treatment via Machine Learning, Molecular Modeling, and In Vitro Validation</title>

L01 was identified as a promising LSD1 inhibitor through ML&#8208;based screening, in vitro validation, and molecular modelling. It exhibited antileukemic activity (IC50 = 24&#160;&#181;M), with binding confirmed by MST/SPR and affinity comparable to SP&#8208;2577 in silico. ADMET profiling indicated good permeability and specificity, though further optimisation is required to enhance safety. These findings support L01 as a potential lead compound.








Abstract
The discovery of potent lysine&#8208;specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD&#8208;1) inhibitors is of significant importance in cancer therapy, as LSD&#8208;1 overexpression contributes to tumour progression and malignancy through the regulation of gene expression. We employed an integrated strategy that combined machine learning&#8208;based virtual screening, bioassay validation, and ligand&#8211;target interaction analysis. Virtual screening identified 29 candidate compounds, of which 17 demonstrated micromolar&#8208;level enzymatic inhibition in experimental assays. Among them, compound L01 showed strong potential as an LSD&#8208;1 inhibitor, exhibiting significant antileukemic activity (IC50 = 24&#160;&#181;M) and confirmed binding to LSD&#8208;1 in Kasumi&#8208;1 cells. MST and SPR analysis confirmed the direct binding between L01 and LSD&#8208;1 inferred from our in vitro studies. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations further supported the interaction, revealing a binding affinity of L01 comparable to that of the well&#8208;characterised reversible inhibitor SP&#8208;2577. ADMET analysis revealed that L01 possesses excellent Caco&#8208;2 permeability and high target specificity; however, its moderate drug&#8208;likeness and potential toxicity issues underscore the need for further optimisation. Through computational modelling and experimental validation, our study identifies L01 as a promising LSD&#8208;1 inhibitor with strong potential for optimisation to improve bioavailability and safety in cancer therapy.

         <title>[n]Helicenes with Red to Near&#8208;Infrared (NIR) Emissions and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helicenes, chiral molecules with helical structures, are promising candidates for circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. This review summarizes recent advances in red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR CPL&#8208;active helicenes and derivatives achieved through &#960;&#8208;conjugation extension, heteroatom doping (B, N, S), and host&#8211;guest induction. The discussed strategies offer new insights for developing high&#8208;performance NIR chiral luminescent materials.








Abstract
The access to various [n]helicenes holds significant values in synthetic chemistry and materials science due to the unique helically chiral structures and potential applications in chiroptoelectronic materials. Particularly, one of the challenges and current interests as well in this area is to construct new chiral systems that can promise intriguing light&#8208;emitting properties and long&#8208;wavelength circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). In general, the luminescence and CPL spectra have proved to be effectively tuned into the far&#8208;red and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regions with reasonably high emission quantum efficiency via extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation or fused&#8208;ring expansion. As the other proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, heteroatom doping of main&#8208;group elements (e.g., O, S, N, B) has also served to enable the precise modulation of molecular electronic structures with reduced HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gaps, leading to the improved performance of NIR CPL. Our minireview offers an overview of rapid progress recently achieved in these emerging chiroptical materials together with extensive discussions on the design strategy and chiroptics both for carbo[n]helicenes and for hetero[n]helicenes, which may provide some new insights into the further pursuit of high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;active chiral luminescent materials.

         <title>Unveiling Intermolecular Frustrated Lewis Pairs in Single&#8208;Molecule Junctions</title>

Scanning tunneling microscopy break junction (STM&#8208;BJ) enables the quantification of FLP formation through distinct conductance attenuation, establishing single&#8208;molecule conductance as an ultrasensitive probe.








Abstract
Intermolecular frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) play vital roles in catalysis yet remain undetectable at the single&#8208;molecule scale due to their ultralow interaction energies and transient nature. This limitation obstructs mechanistic understanding of weak orbital coupling in molecular systems. To address this, we engineered a sterically hindered molecular probe (OPE&#8208;Py&#8208;M) that forms stable in situ FLP adducts with B(C6F5)3 (BCF) within single&#8208;molecule junctions. Using scanning tunneling microscopy break junction (STM&#8208;BJ) techniques, we observed a quantifiable conductance attenuation from 10&#8722;4.39 to 10&#8722;4.78 G0 upon FLP formation, a signature validated by NMR upfield shifts and UV&#8208;Vis charge&#8208;transfer bands. This work establishes single&#8208;molecule conductance as an ultrasensitive probe for orbital perturbations below hydrogen&#8208;bond energy thresholds, enabling unprecedented investigation of noncovalent interactions in molecular electronics and self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>Self&#8208;Contained Calix[3]Acridans with Macrocyclization Induced TADF Property for Highly Selective Recognition of Fe3+ and Detection of Oxidation Degree of Pyrite Medicinal Herbs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of self&#8208;contained calix[3]acridan (o&#8208;/m&#8208;/p&#8208;AC) were synthesized in this work. The multicolor thermally activated delayed fluorescence properties in the crystalline state were achieved by positional isomerization effects and tunable self&#8208;assembly. In addition, taking advantage of the highly selective recognition of Fe3+ by o&#8208;AC, the detection of the oxidation degree of pyrite&#8208;based medicinal herbs was achieved.








Abstract
In this work, a new synthetic strategy for construction of macrocyclic arenes with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADFMAs) property was developed. Consequently, a series of acceptor&#8208;linked calix[3]acridans (o&#8208;/m&#8208;/p&#8208;AC) with self&#8208;contained structures were synthesized by the template effect and the &#8216;&#8217;2&#160;+&#160;1&#8243; fragment coupling reaction. By utilizing the macrocyclic confinement effect to establish through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) pathways and realize effective donor&#8208;acceptor separation, excellent TADF properties of o&#8208;/m&#8208;/p&#8208;AC in both solution and solid state were achieved. Compared to the monomers, the macrocyclization strategy not only significantly enhanced TADF emission of TADFMAs but also enabled the emergence of TADF property from their originally non&#8208;TADF systems. Moreover, these TADFMAs also exhibited multicolor property through positional isomerization effects and tunable self&#8208;assembly. Especially, o&#8208;AC exhibited highly selective recognition toward Fe3+ in solution with the limit of detection (LOD) concentration of 3.8 &#181;M, which was two orders of magnitude lower than the o&#8208;monomer. Furthermore, the detection of the oxidation degree of pyrite&#8208;based medicinal herbs was achieved. This work represents the pioneering example of TADFMAs in detection, and provides a new insight into the development of organic luminescent materials.

         <title>Recent Advances on the Electrosynthesis of H2O2 Through Two&#8208;Electron Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 60, October 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively overviews the electrochemical synthesis of H2O2 via anodic water oxidation, focusing on recent advances in catalyst design, mechanism studies, device fabrication and applications. Finally, the existing challenges and future perspectives in this emerging field are discussed.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an eco&#8208;friendly oxidant with broad industrial applications, including wastewater treatment and paper bleaching. Despite the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process is the dominant method for H2O2 production, there is a growing interest in direct electrochemical synthesis as a greener production method. Electrochemical synthesis, leveraging renewable energy and abundant resources, offers a promising alternative for on&#8208;site H2O2 production. This review focuses on advancements in the two&#8208;electron water oxidation reaction (2e&#8722; WOR) for H2O2 synthesis, covering the reaction mechanisms, catalyst development, and reactor designs. In particular, this review emphasizes the importance of understanding reaction mechanisms on guiding the electrocatalyst design. At the same time, this review highlights challenges in indirect H2O2 through tuning the electrolyte ions, like the carbonate or bicarbonate electrolytes, and the need for a comprehensive understanding of the electrolyte ion mediation pathways to guide the development of accurate theoretical models for predicting catalyst performance.

         <title>The Impact of X&#8208;ray Damage in Chemical Crystalline Materials and New Opportunities for Small Molecule Serial Crystallography</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 60, October 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of X&#8208;ray damage in chemical crystals was minimised by the introduction of area detectors in the late 20th&#8208;century. Now, ever&#8208;brighter X&#8208;ray sources are re&#8208;establishing X&#8208;ray damage as a key challenge. This article reviews recent observations of X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced processes in chemical samples and discusses state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methodologies for their mitigation.








Abstract
In line with the dramatic and continuing improvements in X&#8208;ray generation technologies for laboratory and accelerator sources around the world, reports of X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced processes in chemical crystalline materials are on the rise. These observations are challenging the traditional viewpoint that radiation damage is only of significant concern for protein structure determinations, encouraging small molecule crystallographers to identify and address X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced effects in a broadening range of susceptible materials. This review explores the recent investigations into X&#8208;ray damage and X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced transformations in chemical crystalline materials and discusses state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methodologies to quantify and mitigate the effects of the X&#8208;ray probe on single&#8208;crystal and microcrystalline powder samples.

This review summarizes recent advances in HOF membranes for gas separation. In addition to covering fabrication methods of HOF membranes, this review highlights key characteristics that determine separation performance. Progress in challenging gas separations is deeply discussed, followed by an analysis of current limitations and future research directions for next&#8208;generation membrane development.








Abstract
The development of efficient and sustainable gas separation technologies is crucial for addressing global challenges in energy and the environment. Membrane separation technology, as an innovative, energy&#8208;saving, and highly efficient approach, offers an effective solution to these challenges. High&#8208;performance membranes materials serve as the core component enabling advanced and efficient membrane separation. Notably, hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) represent an emerging class of crystalline porous membrane materials formed through intermolecular hydrogen bonds between organic or metal&#8208;organic building units. The unique advantages of these materials, including moderate synthesis conditions, high crystallinity, and easy repairability and renewability, make them ideal porous membrane materials. This review comprehensively examines recent advances in HOF gas separation membranes. We objectively outline fabrication approaches and material design principle, including development prospects and preparation techniques for HOF separation membranes. We then systematically evaluate the current application status of HOF membranes in gas separation. Finally, future application potentials are projected, and challenges to be addressed in HOF gas separation are discussed.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free PMS Activation by Heterocycle Porous Aromatic Frameworks for Contaminant Degradation</title>

PAF&#8208;146, a porous aromatic framework containing N and S atoms, as a metal&#8208;free catalyst for PMS&#8208;mediated environmental remediation, demonstrates excellent RhB degradation performance through both radical and nonradical pathways.








Abstract
Heteroatoms in heterocycles significantly modify the redox properties of the catalysts, thus exhibiting high efficiency, environmental friendliness, and applicability in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) without metals. Therefore, a porous aromatic framework (PAF&#8208;146) rich in N and S atoms was synthesized from heterocycle building units and exhibited excellent stability. Benefiting from the stability and catalytic activity of PAF&#8208;146, it demonstrated a catalytic performance of degrading 99.7% of Rhodamine B (RhB) within 20&#160;minutes, with a reaction rate constant 95 times higher than that of pristine PAF without N and S atoms. Moreover, PAF&#8208;146 exhibited good resistance to interference from anions, different aquatic environments, and humic acid (HA). The strongly electronegative N and S atoms in PAF&#8208;146 initiated the redistribution of charge density, resulting in positively charged adjacent C atoms. Peroxymonosulfate (PMS) underwent a nucleophilic addition reaction on these C atoms, triggering electron transfer and ultimately leading to the formation of 1O2 and O2&#8226;&#8722;. It was revealed that PAF&#8208;146 achieved efficient degradation of RhB through a combination of radical and nonradical pathways. Our work provides guidance for the development of efficient metal&#8208;free catalysts with abundant catalytic sites for PMS&#8208;activation in environmental remediation.

         <title>&#954;2&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;Sulfurdiimide and &#954;1&#8208;O&#8208;Sulfinylamine Complexes of Tin(IV) Chloride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 60, October 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
NMR evidence shows that tin(IV) chloride complexes with N,N&#8217;&#8208;bidentate sulfur diimide (SDI) ligands exist in a concentration&#8208;dependent equilibrium with acetonitrile, favoring displacement of SDI in dilute solutions. Voltammetry of only the bis&#8208;acetonitrile adduct shows deposition of tin(0) metal upon reduction, which seems to be suppressed in the presence of SDI, suggesting that SDIs may operate as redox&#8208;active ligands.








Abstract
A series of Sn(IV) chloride complexes with sulfur diimide (SDI, R&#8208;NSN&#8208;R) ligands are presented, including structural characterization of first&#8208;in&#8208;class complexes of bidentate diaryl&#8208;SDIs, [SnCl4{&#954;2&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;S(NAr)2}] (Ar&#160;=&#160;4&#8208;X&#8208;C6H4&#8208;), and an oxygen&#8208;coordinated sulfinylamine, [SnCl4{&#954;1&#8208;O&#8208;OSNPh}2]. As part of the comprehensive experimental and DFT computational investigation, 119Sn NMR analysis revealed a dynamic exchange equilibrium in acetonitrile between SDI ligands and solvent, providing insight into their complicated solution&#8208;state chemical and electrochemical behavior. Voltammetric experiments show that, despite this dynamic equilibrium, the SDI ligands appear to suppress typical Sn(IV) reduction pathways. While tentative due to the complex behavior, this suggests that SDIs are functioning as redox&#8208;active (RA) ligands.

&lt;p&gt;NMR evidence shows that tin(IV) chloride complexes with &lt;i&gt;N,N&lt;/i&gt;&#8217;-bidentate sulfur diimide (SDI) ligands exist in a concentration-dependent equilibrium with acetonitrile, favoring displacement of SDI in dilute solutions. Voltammetry of only the &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;-acetonitrile adduct shows deposition of tin(0) metal upon reduction, which seems to be suppressed in the presence of SDI, suggesting that SDIs may operate as redox-active ligands.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of Sn(IV) chloride complexes with sulfur diimide (SDI, R-NSN-R) ligands are presented, including structural characterization of first-in-class complexes of bidentate diaryl-SDIs, [SnCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;{&#954;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8242;-S(NAr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}] (Ar&#160;=&#160;4-X-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-), and an oxygen-coordinated sulfinylamine, [SnCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;{&#954;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-OSNPh}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]. As part of the comprehensive experimental and DFT computational investigation, &lt;sup&gt;119&lt;/sup&gt;Sn NMR analysis revealed a dynamic exchange equilibrium in acetonitrile between SDI ligands and solvent, providing insight into their complicated solution-state chemical and electrochemical behavior. Voltammetric experiments show that, despite this dynamic equilibrium, the SDI ligands appear to suppress typical Sn(IV) reduction pathways. While tentative due to the complex behavior, this suggests that SDIs are functioning as redox-active (RA) ligands. In conjunction with our previous systematic characterization of diaryl-SDIs, these findings highlight their potential as an easily derivatized and highly redox-tunable category of RA ligand and emphatically warrant further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Abnormal N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;stabilized phosphinidene, a class of low&#8208;valent phosphorus compounds, has been recently stabilized by an isolated abnormal NHC. However, its coordination chemistry with various metal ions remained unexplored. Herein, we have explored the coordination chemistry of a mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphinidene (mNHP,1), stabilized by an abnormal N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (aNHC) with various metals (Cu, Zn, and Sn) to afford trimetallic, bimetallic, and monometallic complexes, respectively. All these complexes were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. We have also explored the catalytic activity of one of these complexes for alkynylation of trifluoromethyl ketones and found that mNHP (1)&#8208;bound trimetallic Cu&#8208;complex is an excellent catalyst for this reaction with up to 97% isolated yield under low catalyst loading (3 mol%).

A facile synthesis of unsymmetrical 1,1&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted ferrocene derivatives based on the desymmetrization of 1,1&#8217;&#8208;diborylferrocene was developed. Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling (SMCC) reaction of 1,1&#8217;&#8208;diborylferrocene afforded mono&#8208;substituted products without significant loss of the second boryl group, and the subsequent second SMCC reaction afforded the desired unsymmetrical 1,1&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted ferrocene derivatives. This method provides a versatile synthetic platform for tuning the electronic and steric properties of functional ferrocene derivatives.








Abstract
Unsymmetrical 1,1&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted ferrocene is a versatile scaffold for various functional molecules, including organic electronics, catalysts, and bioactive molecules. Herein, we report a facile synthesis of unsymmetrical 1,1&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted ferrocene derivatives based on the desymmetrization of 1,1&#8217;&#8208;diborylferrocene. We found that Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling (SMCC) reaction using 1,1&#8217;&#8208;bis(Bpin)ferrocene affords the mono&#8208;substituted product without significant loss of the second boryl group. Then, second SMCC reaction of the obtained 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8217;&#8208;(Bpin)ferrocene affords the desired unsymmetrical 1,1&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted ferrocene derivatives in reasonable yields. This method provides a versatile synthetic platform for tuning the electronic and steric properties of functional ferrocene derivatives and for the structural development of bioactive compounds.

         <title>Assembly&#8208;Sized&#8208;Controlled Chirality: Increase from Single Molecule to Micrometer Scale Enhances Chiroptical Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 60, October 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We envision a series of chiroptical materials based on highly emissive chiral dye DCS&#8208;Chol in multiple states of solution, powder, aggregate, gel, thin film, and liquid crystal (LC) encapsulation, the |glum| value in LC encapsulation was even amplified 491&#8208;fold, indicating a positive correlation between aggregate/assembly size and chiroptical activity.








Abstract
Achieving a high dissymmetry factor is a major challenge in the field of chiroptical activity. Notably, there is no systematic theory, from the perspective of assembly size, for achieving highly dissymmetric chiroptical materials. Here, we envision a highly emissive fluorophore DCS&#8208;Chol in multiple states, by covalently linking fluorescent dicyanodistyrylbenzene (DCS) with chiral cholesterol (Chol). DCS&#8208;Chol has a superb fluorescence quantum yield (36&#8211;74%) as a solution, powder, aggregate, gel, thin film, and liquid crystal (LC) encapsulation due to the locally excited transition. Interestingly, the successive increase in size of DCS&#8208;Chol aggregates/assemblies from single molecule to LC encapsulated state (105&#160;nm) was accompanied by amplification of circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence, indicating a positive correlation between aggregate/assembly size and chiroptical activity. In this work, a mechanism has been roundly proposed for the occurrence and amplification of chiroptical activity from the perspective of assembly size.

Proton&#8208;conducting amorphous alumina electrolyte derived from &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 and &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 showing disordered atomic configuration with multiple fast&#8208;ion pathways, achieving ionic conductivity of 0.08&#8211;0.12 S/cm at 480&#8211;540&#160;&#176;C for solid oxide fuel cell applications.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance electrolytes enabling rapid ionic transport represents a critical pathway for operational temperature reduction in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). This study introduces amorphous alumina (AlOx) as a novel electrolyte material, systematically investigating its structural characteristics and charge transport mechanisms through comparative analysis with crystalline alumina (&#945;&#8208;Al2O3, &#947;&#8208;Al2O3) and conventional gadolinium&#8208;doped ceria (GDC). It is found that AlOx possesses a notable enrichment of oxygen vacancy concentration. Its unique disordered atomic configuration plays a vital role in facilitating multiple pathways to enable fast ionic transport, resulting in high ionic conductivity of 0.08&#8211;0.12 S/cm at 480&#8211;540&#160;&#176;C, as evidenced by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), which is one order of magnitude superior to its crystalline counterpart. When implemented in symmetrical SOFC configurations, the AlOx electrolyte demonstrates unprecedented power density of 677&#160;mW/cm2 at 540 &#176;C. Further distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analysis confirms the predominance of protonic conduction pathways in AlOx while providing discernment of its electrochemical sub&#8208;processes. This work thus provides a new advanced electrolyte for low&#8208;temperature SOFCs while providing insights into amorphous ceramic.

         <title>Synthesis of Fully Exposed Pt Nanoparticles on a 2D Mesoporous Graphitic Nanocarbon Framework for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 60, October 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a novel 2D mesoporous graphitic nanocarbon framework (MGF) is synthesized through chemical etching of 2D Fe3O4 nanocube superlattices (Fe3O4 NCSLs) and subsequent high&#8208;temperature graphitization. MGF possesses large specific surface area, open porous architecture, and high graphitization degree, making it an excellent platform for constructing Pt&#8208;based ORR electrocatalysts. The resulting Pt@MGF catalyst&#160;exhibits superior ORR activity and durability over commercial Pt/C catalysts.








Abstract
The durability of proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells is often compromised by the corrosion of carbon supports in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) cathodes under harsh operating conditions, including high oxygen concentration, elevated humidity, low pH, and high potentials. To overcome this limitation, we report the synthesis of a 2D mesoporous graphitic nanocarbon framework (MGF) via chemical etching and high&#8208;temperature graphitization. The resulting MGF features a monolayer, highly ordered nanoframe architecture that offers enhanced structural stability and conductivity. Leveraging these structural advantages, we designed fully exposed Pt nanoparticles anchored on the MGF (Pt@MGF) as a model system to investigate the interplay between graphitization degree, pore architecture, and electrocatalytic performance. Among the variants, Pt@MGF&#8208;1200, synthesized at 1200&#160;&#176;C, demonstrates optimized mesopore confinement and strong Pt&#8211;carbon interactions. This results in superior electrochemical durability and ORR activity, positioning Pt@MGF&#8208;1200 as a promising alternative to conventional Pt/C catalysts.

         <title>Pomegranate&#8211;Like Nano&#8208;Confined Silicon Inside Conductive Carbon Black as Anode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

We report a new strategy to prepare a pomegranate&#8208;like nano&#8208;confined silicon&#8208;carbon composites with excellent performance through a combination of wet chemical reduction methods and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique. The Si/XC@C&#8208;0.2 electrode exhibited a capacity retention rate of 157.7% after 400 cycles at a current density of 1 A g&#8722;1, while the Si/XC@C&#8208;0.5 electrode achieved the highest capacity after 400 cycles, reaching 835&#160;mA h g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Si materials possess a high theoretical specific capacity when used as anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Si/C composites mitigate volume expansion and enhance conductivity, thus achieving improved electrochemical performance in LIBs. Herein, we report a new strategy for preparing pomegranate&#8208;like Si/C nanocomposites based on low&#8208;cost, readily available conductive carbon black (XC) by using a combination of wet chemical reduction and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques. The preparation first involves a facile wet chemical approach to controlled hydrolysis of SiCl4 within XC. Subsequently, the obtained SiO2/XC precursor is reduced to highly crystalline Si particles within XC (Si/XC) using a novel ionic liquid&#8208;magnesium reduction system, avoiding unwanted byproducts associated with conventional high&#8208;temperature magnesium reduction. Finally, a pomegranate&#8208;like Si/XC composite is coated with an outer carbon layer via CVD, forming a nano&#8208;confined Si/C structure. The composites exhibit excellent reversible capacity and good cycle stability in LIBs. At 1 A g&#8722;1 after 400 cycles, the Si/XC@C&#8208;0.5 composite delivered the highest specific capacity of 835&#160;mA h g&#8722;1, exhibiting a capacity retention rate of 121% compared to the first cycle after activation (688&#160;mA h g&#8722;1). This work provides reproducible and scalable means to prepare high&#8208;performance Si/C composites for LIBs.

         <title>Synthesis of the Soft Lewis Superacid Tris(4&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorophenyl)borane B(C6F4Br)3 via C&#8210;Ag to C&#8210;B Transmetalation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 60, October 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The soft Lewis acid B(C6F4Br)3 was synthesized via transmetalation from AgC6F4Br, and its Lewis acidity was assessed via DFT calculations and experimental methods, indicating an increased acidity compared to B(C6F5)3. The presence of bromine atoms is expected to facilitate structural analysis of Lewis acid&#8208;base adducts of B(C6F4Br)3 by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction in the future.








Abstract
The Lewis acid tris(4&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorophenyl)borane B(C6F4Br)3 was synthesized via transmetalation from BBr3 and AgC6F4Br. The latter was prepared from 1,4&#8208;C6F4BrSiMe3 with AgF and crystallized as a toluene solvate [2(AgC6F4Br)4&#8226;7.46(toluene)]. The solid&#8208;state structure of free B(C6F4Br)3 and its Lewis base adducts with EtCN, H2O, and POEt3 was determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. DFT calculations show that B(C6F4Br)3 has approximately 1% higher fluoride and hydride ion affinities (FIA and HIA) than tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane B(C6F5)3. Similarly, the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method indicates an increase in Lewis acidity of 2%, whereas IR spectroscopy of the CD3CN adducts reveals a slightly lower &#7805;(CN) vibration for B(C6F4Br)3. The presence of bromine atoms is expected to facilitate structural analysis of Lewis acid&#8208;base adducts of B(C6F4Br)3 by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction in the future.

         <title>Terminal Selective Arylation of Inert Alkanes via Radical&#8208;Organometallic Crossover</title>

Selectivity is an essential part of organic synthesis and key to synthetic efficiency. However, selectivity is challenging to achieve in hydrocarbon molecules. Herein we report a mild and direct method that combines photo&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (photo&#8208;HAT) and nickel&#8208;catalyzed organometallic chainwalking chemistry to give the first highly linear selective arylation reaction starting from inert alkanes.








Abstract
Selectivity is an essential part of organic synthesis and key to synthetic efficiency, where it can help reduce energy requirements for product separation, purification, and disposal of low value by&#8208;products. However, selectivity is challenging to achieve in hydrocarbon molecules, with C&#9472;H functionalization of alkanes almost invariably leading to a complex mixture of products favoring branched isomers and linear selectivity remaining elusive. Herein we report a mild and direct method that combines photo&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (photo&#8208;HAT) and nickel catalyzed organometallic chainwalking chemistry to give the first highly linear selective arylation reaction starting from inert alkanes. Key to success is crossover from a radical to organometallic chainwalking mechanism permitted by a monodentate lutidine ligand, allowing an unselective photo&#8208;HAT step to be funneled regioconvergently to form the linear arylation product for a variety of alkanes. This result is in sharp contrast to the unselective formation of branched products using bidentate ligands and demonstrates monodentate heterocycles to be a privileged ligand class for selective C&#9472;H functionalization. Preliminary mechanistic experiments are consistent with the radical&#8208;organometallic crossover mechanism and support it as an important step toward controllable and selective functionalization of simple hydrocarbons.

Key to success is crossover from a radical to organometallic chainwalking mechanism permitted by a monodentate lutidine ligand, allowing an unselective photo-HAT step to be funneled regioconvergently to form the linear arylation product for a variety of alkanes. This result is in sharp contrast to the unselective formation of branched products using bidentate ligands and demonstrates monodentate heterocycles to be a privileged ligand class for selective C&#9472;H functionalization. Preliminary mechanistic experiments are consistent with the radical-organometallic crossover mechanism and support it as an important step toward controllable and selective functionalization of simple hydrocarbons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The N&#8208;Bromo&#8208;Hammick Intermediate</title>

Spectroscopic and computational analysis uncovers the &#963;2&#963;*0 electronic structure of the N&#8208;bromo&#8208;Hammick intermediate, a singlet N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene isolated in solid neon, whose back&#8208;isomerization to bromopyridine proceeds via a planar transition state.








Abstract
We report the characterization of bromopyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, the N&#8208;bromo&#8208;Hammick intermediate, isolated in solid neon at 4.4&#160;K. Computations (B2PLYP, NEVPT2), IR, and UV/vis spectroscopy characterize this intermediate as a singlet carbene with a vacant &#963;*&#8208;type frontier orbital. This unusual electronic structure (&#963;2&#963;*0) allows the carbene to isomerize to its more stable pyridine tautomer via a planar transition state, avoiding the deviation from planarity seen in other singlet carbenes. The compound's reaction with molecular hydrogen faces a minor but prohibitive barrier (8.4&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1) at the low temperatures of the experiment.

         <title>Stereoselective Syntheses of Cyclic Microsclerodermin Derivatives</title>

Six different cyclic microsclerodermin derivatives are obtained from l&#8208;xylose and d&#8208;arabinose via stereoselective Sakurai allylations and photochemical Arndt&#8208;Eistert homologations.








Abstract
Starting from l&#8208;xylose and d&#8208;arabinose, six different cyclic microscleroderma derivatives were successfully obtained. Key steps of the syntheses are, on the one hand, Sakurai allylations, whose stereochemical course depends on the Lewis acid used, and on the other hand, photochemical Wolff rearrangements in the presence of complex aminofuranosides. Finally, aromatic side chains were introduced via cross metathesis.

         <title>Binding of Tetrapentylammonium to a c&#8208;MYC G&#8208;quadruplex Depicted through NMR and Volumetric Assessment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrapentylammonium forms a stable complex with c&#8208;MYC G&#8208;quadruplex, in which the ligand is positioned above the terminal G9&#8208;G13&#8208;G18&#8208;G22 quartet of the host structure and is surrounded by the 3'&#8208;(T23&#8208;A24&#8208;A25) flanking region. The binding proceeds with the release of waters of hydration and a slight decrease in the dynamics of the G&#8208;quadruplex.








Abstract
We recently have demonstrated that, their structural simplicity notwithstanding, tetraalkylammonium (TAA+) ions, i.e., [H(CH2)n]4N+, strongly stabilize the parallel c&#8208;MYC G&#8208;quadruplex while not affecting the thermal stabilities of the antiparallel human telomeric G&#8208;quadruplex or duplex DNA. In the present work, we expand on our discovered paradigm of topology&#8208;selective G&#8208;quadruplex recognition by performing NMR spectroscopic and volumetric characterization of the complex between tetrapentylammonium (TPeA+) and the c&#8208;MYC G&#8208;quadruplex. The binding of TAA+ to the c&#8208;MYC G&#8208;quadruplex is optically silent, which necessitates the use of nonoptical observables, such as density and sound velocity. Our NMR results revealed that TPeA+ forms a stable complex with the c&#8208;MYC G&#8208;quadruplex in which the ligand is positioned above the G9&#8208;G13&#8208;G18&#8208;G22 quartet and is surrounded by the 3&#8242;&#8208;(T23&#8208;A24&#8208;A25) flanking region. We used our densimetric and ultrasonic velocimetric results to calculate changes in volume, &#916;V, and adiabatic compressibility, &#916;KS, accompanying the binding of TPeA+ to the c&#8208;MYC G&#8208;quadruplex. We rationalized these volumetric properties to determine binding&#8208;induced changes in hydration of the associating molecules and the internal dynamics of the host G&#8208;quadruplex. In general, the structural and physico&#8208;chemical insights emerging from this work lay the foundation for further studies of TAA+&#8208;based compounds as a possible starting point for designing topology&#8208;sensitive G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;binding agents.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Mediated Activation of 1,3&#8208;Dienes and Allenes via Energy Transfers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nature has inspired chemists to develop photocatalytic processes that harness visible light, offering alternative reaction pathways beyond traditional thermal methods. Energy Transfer (EnT) is a particularly promising strategy, enabling transformations such as isomerization, deracemization, cycloadditions, and cascade reactions. EnT can activate otherwise inert substrates, providing energy&#8208;efficient and atom&#8208;economical routes to complex molecular architectures. This review focuses on recent advances in EnT&#8208;mediated activation of conjugated 1,3&#8208;dienes and allenes, highlighting their synthetic potential and applications in material science.








Abstract
Nature has inspired chemists toward the development of photocatalytic processes. By harvesting visible light, chemists can access alternative reaction pathways that bypass traditional thermal methods. Energy transfer (EnT) stands out for enabling the activation of otherwise inert substrates, generating the corresponding triplet states. This review highlights and compare the recent advances in EnT&#8208;mediated activation of conjugated 1,3&#8208;dienes and allenes (cumulated 1,2&#8208;dienes), which represent an underdeveloped avenue for synthetic purposes. These approaches enable novel transformations, ranging from photoisomerization to challenging cycloaddition. These findings can have broad implications across synthetic chemistry and materials science, offering energy&#8208;efficient and atom&#8208;economical routes to complex molecular architectures. Studies employing indirect functionalization, in which these motifs are not directly activated via EnT, are explicitly excluded from this review.

         <title>Deuteration of Six&#8208;Membered N&#8208;Heteroarenes: Chemistry and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deuterated six&#8208;membered N&#8208;Heteroarenes (6NHetAr) are finding utility in an increasing repertoire of applications. Our paper comprehensively reviews synthetic approaches that have been reported for the deuteration of 6NHetAr and their fused counterparts while providing an overview of established and emerging applications for these materials.








Abstract
Six&#8208;membered N&#8208;heteroarenes (&#8220;6NHetAr&#8221;) play pivotal roles in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and materials science industries. In recent times, deuterium (D)&#8208;labelled 6NHetAr have demonstrated enhanced performance over their unlabelled counterparts. For example, VV116 and VX&#8208;984, approved therapeutics for the treatment of COVID&#8208;19 and cancer, and deuterated functional materials for use as ligands in catalysts and organometallic light&#8208;emitters. As interest in this field continues to grow, there is a corresponding need to develop more efficient, scalable, and sustainable approaches to deuterate 6NHetAr. In this work, we comprehensively review approaches developed for the incorporation of D into 6NHetAr, their fused counterparts, and complex compounds containing 6NHetAr. We also provide an overview of established and emerging applications for these materials.

&lt;p&gt;Six-membered N-heteroarenes (&#8220;6NHetAr&#8221;) play pivotal roles in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and materials science industries. In recent times, deuterium (D)-labelled 6NHetAr have demonstrated enhanced performance over their unlabelled counterparts. For example, VV116 and VX-984, approved therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 and cancer, and deuterated functional materials for use as ligands in catalysts and organometallic light-emitters. As interest in this field continues to grow, there is a corresponding need to develop more efficient, scalable, and sustainable approaches to deuterate 6NHetAr. In this work, we comprehensively review approaches developed for the incorporation of D into 6NHetAr, their fused counterparts, and complex compounds containing 6NHetAr. We also provide an overview of established and emerging applications for these materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Steric Restraints in Redox&#8208;Active Guanidine Ligands and Their Impact on Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One carbon makes the difference; a diguandine with an ethylene bridge does not coordinate metals, while a diguanidine with a propylene bridge coordinates to a variety of metals. In this work, we report the synthesis and coordination chemistry of the first cyclic diguanidino&#8208;benzene ligands and compare their coordination chemistry with that of open diguanidino&#8208;benzene ligands.








Abstract
The introduction of redox&#8208;active ligands into coordination compounds is attractive for a number of applications; intramolecular electron transfer between a redox&#8208;active ligand and a metal is the basis for applications in switchable devices and advanced redox catalysis for multielectron substrate activations. A fine&#8208;tuning of the properties of redox&#8208;active ligands focusses on the redox potential and frontier orbital energies, as well as the steric demand and coordination mode. In this work, we report the first synthesis of new o&#8208;diguanidino&#8208;benzene ligands in which the two guanidino groups are connected through an alkyl chain of different length. The introduction of an ethylene bridge between the two guanidino groups turns a strongly coordinating ligand into a noncoordinating molecule, while keeping its strong Br&#248;nsted basicity. These features qualify the ethylene&#8208;bridged compound as a powerful alternative to Huenig's base, diisopropyl&#8208;ethyl&#8208;amine. The change from an ethylene to a propylene bridge switches back on the coordination ability. It is also possible to introduce a methyl group to the central C atom of the propylene bridge without loss of nucleophilic properties. The analysis, based on a variety of metal complexes, identifies three structural parameters to assay the structural restraint. Macrocyclic tetraguanidines are also formed.

         <title>Reversible and Massive Structural Transformation in Meltable Cyanido&#8208;bridged Coordination Polymer Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Melting crystals containing separated domains of KCd[Cu(CN)2]3 and K2Cu3(CN)5 were obtained via simple dehydration of K2Cd(H2O)Cu4(CN)8&#183;1.5H2O. Their low melting point of 559&#160;K resulted from the combined effects of strong crystal&#8208;interface interactions and low&#8208;coordinate Cu nodes.








Abstract
Cyanido (CN&#8722;)&#8208;bridged coordination polymers (CP) have been extensively studied as molecular&#8208;based functional materials. However, synthesizing 3D compounds composed only of metal ions and CN&#8722;&#8212;without bulky organic groups&#8212;and that melt before decomposing remains a considerable challenge. This difficulty arises because CN&#8722; strongly interconnect metal ions, forming rigid, dense frameworks with high melting points. In this study, we successfully synthesized a melting composite consisting of 3D KCd[Cu(CN)2]3 and 2D K2Cu3(CN)5 by dehydrating K2Cd(H2O)Cu4(CN)8&#183;1.5H2O. Remarkably, nanodomains of these two compounds coexisted within single particles, allowing their crystal structures to be independently determined by 3D electron diffraction (MicroED) of the resulting powders. Each compound melted at its respective melting point, around 559&#160;K. Notably, the melting point of KCd[Cu(CN)2]3 is unusually low for a 3D dense coordination framework. This atypically low melting point results from a combination of crystalline surface effects, and the entropy contribution of the dynamic, labile two&#8208;coordinate Cu centers in the framework. Additionally, we demonstrated a reversible transformation between the dehydrated mixture and the hydrated parent compound through exposure to water vapor, highlighting the dynamic and responsive nature of these CN&#8722;&#8208;based solid&#8208;state materials.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrogenation of Primary Amines to Nitriles: Hydrogen Release in Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers</title>

Ru(II) p&#8208;cymene complexes of amide&#8208;based ligands catalyze the double dehydrogenation of primary amines, presenting their role in hydrogen production and storage using amine/nitrile pairs as LOHCs.








Abstract
The synthesis of new Ru(II) p&#8208;cymene complexes of amide&#8208;based ligands and their role in hydrogen production and storage via dehydrogenation using amine/nitrile pairs as liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) is presented. The substrate scope includes aliphatic (including the long&#8208;chain amines) as well as aromatic primary amines. Various biologically important amines were also applicable to this dehydrogenation process, such as furfurylamine, 3&#8208;picolylamine, indole&#8208;3&#8208;methanamine, tryptamine, and 2,6&#8208;dichlorobenzylamine. Control experiments, detailed concentration&#8208;dependent, and temperature&#8208;dependent kinetic studies were carried out, including a Hammett plot. A plausible mechanism for acceptorless double dehydrogenation of primary amines is also proposed on the basis of these analyses, suggesting the presence of Ru&#8208;H species. The catalyst's recyclability was tested up to 5 cycles without showing any significant drop in the product yield.

         <title>Hybrid Nanostructures by Covalent Functionalization of MoS2 and WS2 with C60 Undergoing Excited Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the synthesis and characterization of MoS2&#8211;C60 and WS2&#8211;C60 nanohybrids via rapid covalent functionalization with a modified C60. The nanohybrids exhibit excellent solubility in various solvents and enable efficient electron transfer, forming MoS2&#8226;+&#8211;C60&#8226;&#8208; and WS2&#8226;+&#8211;C60&#8226;&#8208; species, thus highlighting their potential for light energy harvesting.








Abstract
In this contribution, we report the formation, characterization, and photophysical assessment of hybrid nanostructures realized via a rapid and straightforward covalent functionalization reaction between MoS2 or WS2 and a modified C60 bearing a 1,2&#8208;dithiolane chain. Transmission electron microscopy imaging analysis confirmed that the resulting hybrids are homogeneous at the nanoscale level, effectively suppressing undesired fullerene&#8211;fullerene aggregation. X&#8208;ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopy evidenced the covalent connection between the two species, and thermogravimetry determined the loading of C60 onto MoS2 or WS2. The MoS2&#8211;C60 and WS2&#8211;C60 hybrids were stable in liquid media, forming homogeneous inks, which enabled the investigation of thermodynamically feasible, excitonic electron transfer resulting in the formation of MoS2&#8226;+&#8211;C60&#8226;&#8208; and WS2&#8226;+&#8211;C60&#8226;&#8208; radical ion pairs by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The measured rates were found to be 1.92&#160;&#215;&#160;107 s&#8722;1 for MoS2&#8211;C60 and 3.50&#160;&#215;&#160;107 s&#8722;1, respectively, revealing their potential as light energy harvesting materials.

         <title>Carbon and Heteroatom Activation via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Bound Dearomative Intermediates for Stereoselective Annulation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Use of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) to activate carbon and heteroatoms in aromatic compounds is reviewed based on key dearomative NHC&#8208;bound intermediates, i.e., ortho&#8208;quinodimethanes (o&#8208;QDMs), ortho&#8208;quinone methides (o&#8208;QMs) and aza&#8208;analogs (aza&#8208;o&#8208;QMs), aza&#8208;fulvene and triaza&#8208;diene intermediates. Their formation and reactivity in stereoselective annulation reactions for the synthesis of enantioenriched (hetero)cyclic molecules are discussed.








Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organocatalysis has long been recognized as a powerful and versatile method for the implementation of (asymmetric) transformations enabling the formation of C&#9472;C and C&#8211;heteroatom bonds. A number of NHC&#8208;bound active ionic species have been classically established for activation of carbon atoms as either nucleophiles or electrophiles at diverse positions, such as (aza)Breslow intermediates, homoenolate equivalents, azolium (di)enolates, simple acyl (imidoyl) azoliums, and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated/alkynyl acyl azoliums. Within this realm, the past decade has witnessed a blossoming interest in the deployment of NHC&#8208;tethered dearomative intermediates for the activation of both carbon atoms and heteroatoms in aromatic compounds. Accordingly, functionalization of benzylic carbon atoms was made possible through catalyst&#8208;bound o&#8208;quinodimethanes (o&#8208;QDMs), while remote activation of oxygen and nitrogen atoms was effectively achieved through NHC&#8208;bound o&#8208;quinone methides (o&#8208;QMs) and aza&#8208;analogs (aza&#8208;o&#8208;QMs), along with aza&#8208;fulvene type intermediates and triaza&#8208;diene species. Aim of this review is to provide an overview of the most relevant literature on the development of NHC&#8208;bound dearomative intermediates for carbon and heteroatom activation since 2013, with emphasis on their applications for stereoselective annulation reactions.

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;Based Glycomacrocycles: Synthesis, Photoisomerization, and Photomodulation of Liquid Crystal Helical Pitch with Helix Inversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic glycoazobenzenes: Four new azobenzene&#8208;functionalized glycomacrolactones bearing different substituents on the glucopyranoside ring have been synthesized. These photoswitchable chiral macrocycles behave as chiral dopants of NLCs, with an amplification of helix upon E to Z photoisomerization and enforcement of HTP at Z&#8208;rich state. Critical influence of sugar ring functionalization in governing chirality transfer and photoswitching behavior has been demonstrated. Two of the synthesized glycomacrocycles uniquely achieved photoinduced helix inversion&#8212;marking the first such example for this class of compounds.








Abstract
Novel azobenzene&#8208;embedded glycomacrolactones bearing different substituents on the glucopyranoside ring have been synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy, UV/vis spectroscopy, and circular dichroism (CD), then applied for cholesteric liquid crystal photomodulation. All the macrocycles displayed good photochromic properties, fatigue resistance, thermal bistability, and chiroptical activity. As chiral dopants for nematic liquid crystal (NLC), an amplification of helix upon E to Z photoisomerization and enforcement of helical twisting power (HTP) at Z&#8208;rich state have been observed. We also demonstrated the critical influence of sugar&#8208;ring functionalization in governing chirality transfer and photoswitching behavior in cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs). Two of the synthesized glycomacrocycles uniquely achieved photoinduced helix inversion&#8212;marking the first such example for this class of compounds.

         <title>Advancing Bidirectional Photoswitching of Norbornadienes: Exclusively Light&#8208;Induced Interconversion of Imide&#8208; and Ortho&#8208;Connected Norbornadiene&#8208;Perylene Diimide Hybrids</title>

         <dc:description>
Bidirectional Photoswitching: We report norbornadiene&#8208;perylene diimide (NBD&#8208;PDI) dyads with diverse connectivities, enabling exclusively photoinduced NBD/QC switching. Our findings reveal high conversion yields in both directions, paired with good thermal&#8208; and photo&#8208;stability. Rapid back&#8208;isomerization to NBD occurs upon visible light irradiation, highlighting the potential for on&#8208;demand energy release in energy storage applications.








Abstract
The norbornadiene/quadricyclane (NBD/QC) photoswitch is a promising candidate for molecular solar energy storage. Isomerization to the energy&#8208;storing, metastable QC occurs upon UV light irradiation, while the back&#8208;switching can be triggered in various ways. However, inducing complete, on&#8208;demand energy release across multiple switching cycles remains a significant challenge in molecular solar thermal (MOST) research. We demonstrate the implementation of perylene diimide (PDI) as covalently connected, photoactive redox&#8208;catalyst to enable NBD regeneration upon 475&#160;nm irradiation. We investigated the NBD/QC interconversion of several imide&#8208; and ortho&#8208;connected NBD&#8208;PDI hybrids upon irradiation at 310&#160;nm and 475&#160;nm, revealing that the connection position on PDI only minimally affects the interconversion efficiency. Concentration&#8208;dependent studies identified an alternative intermolecular back&#8208;isomerization mechanism in addition to the previously known intramolecular pathway, for which adequate flexibility of the linker proved crucial for effective back&#8208;isomerization to NBD. This study advances the exclusively photoinduced isomerization of the NBD/QC system within novel NBD&#8208;PDI dyads, establishing a framework for the targeted manipulation of NBD hybrids with potential application in energy storage. The presented switches operate independently, without the need for further additives to facilitate interconversion, which renders them promising candidates for molecular solar energy storage research.

         <title>Tuning the Excited State Character of Amine/Carbonyl Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters with Ring Fusion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring fusion in MR&#8208;TADF emitters can affect the charge transfer excited state and therefore the photophysical properties. Here we investigate the effect of ring fusion in two structurally similar molecules to identify the advantages and disadvantages of this strategy.








Abstract
Multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters exhibit short&#8208;range charge transfer (SRCT) and have narrow emission, whereas donor&#8208;acceptor TADF emitters show long&#8208;range charge transfer (LRCT) and rapid reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). While some work has been done to create intermediate&#8208;type materials with narrow emission and rapid RISC simultaneously, no studies of structurally comparable donor&#8208;acceptor versus MR&#8208;TADF systems have been described. Here we report two TADF emitters, Acr&#8208;DiKTa and Iso&#8208;DiDiKTa, to examine the effect of ring fusion on LRCT and SRCT character. Acr&#8208;DiKTa appends an acridone moiety to quinolino[3,2,1&#8208;de]acridine&#8208;5,9&#8208;dione to create a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;type structure, while a carbonyl bridge fuses these moieties in Iso&#8208;DiDiKTa to give an MR&#8208;TADF structure. Acr&#8208;DiKTa emits blue&#8208;green in toluene with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 38&#160;nm whereas Iso&#8208;DiDiKTa emits green&#8208;yellow with a FWHM of 34&#160;nm. Calculated orbital distributions show SRCT in the first excited state for both compounds. Both compounds are TADF active in doped films, and derived rate constants show that RISC is four times more rapid in Acr&#8208;DiKTa. This study shows that while ring fusion enhances color purity, donor&#8208;acceptor structures can achieve comparable FWHMs and rapid RISC through dominant SRCT supported by LRCT for best performance in TADF materials.

         <title>Effects of Peripheral Substituents on the Optical and Electrochemical Properties of Dibenzo&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;triazaporphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New derivatives of dibenzo&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;triazaporphyrin (DBTriAP) with substituents on the meso and/or &#946;&#8208;pyrrolic carbons were prepared, and their optical and electrochemical properties were revealed. The peripheral substituents were found to exert significant impacts on the fluorescence property and aggregation behavior of the DBTriAP chromophore in solution.








Abstract
In contrast to the great advances of phthalocyanine&#8208;based materials, the potential of 5,10,15&#8208;triazaporphyrins has not been realized because of the lack of fundamental information about their structure&#8208;property relationships. Here, we report new derivatives of dibenzo&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;triazaporphyrin (DBTriAP) with aryl or alkyl substituents at the meso and/or &#946; positions. Freebases of DBTriAP were prepared by the condensation of two types of 1,9&#8208;dibromodipyrrins with 1,3&#8208;diiminoisoindoline and subsequent functionalization of the &#946;&#8208;pyrrolic carbons. Zinc(II) complexes of DBTriAP were obtained by complexation of the corresponding freebases with zinc(II) acetate. The optical and electrochemical properties of the DBTriAP derivatives were studied by steady&#8208;state and transient ultraviolet/visible absorption/emission spectroscopy, magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Replacing the &#946;&#8208;pyrrolic hydrogens of the 5&#8208;mesityl&#8208;DBTriAP derivatives with aryl groups resulted in substantial red shifts of the low&#8208;energy absorption band because of the effective &#960;&#8208;delocalization and/or charge&#8208;transfer interaction with the DBTriAP chromophore. The 2,3,17,18&#8208;tetraethyl&#8208;DBTriAP freebase exhibited split redox processes in its cyclic voltammogram, suggesting the rapid formation of a &#960;&#8208;stacked dimer radical cation facilitated by the highly planar structure. Most of the DBTriAP derivatives emitted red fluorescence with quantum yields of 0.07&#8211;0.31, indicating their potential as luminescent materials.

         <title>Effects of Isomorphous Substitution on Photophysical and Magnetic Properties of Complexes [Ln1&#8208;xDyx(MeDPQ)2Cl3] (Ln&#160;=&#160;Y3+, Ho3+, and Er3+)</title>

We present the research on the coordination compounds [Ln(MeDPQ)2Cl3] with Dy3+, Ho3+, and Er3+ ions and the solid solutions [Ln1&#8208;xDyx(MeDPQ)2Cl3] based on them. The investigated materials exhibited multifunctionality: they absorb light in the UV, visible, and NIR range; emit in the visible and NIR range; demonstrate weak magnetic interactions; and possess exceptional thermal stability.








Abstract
This work encompasses the study of magnetic, optical, and structural properties of the coordination compounds [Ln(MeDPQ)2Cl3] (Ln &#9472; Ho3+, Er3+, Dy3+, and Y3+; MeDPQ &#8722; 2&#8208;methyldipyrido&#8208;[3,2&#8208;f:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;h]&#8208;quinoxaline) and substituted complexes [Ln1&#8208;xDyx(MeDPQ)2Cl3] (Ln&#160;=&#160;Ho3+, Er3+, and Y3+) based on them. Magnetic measurements within the range 5&#8211;300&#160;K revealed single ion anisotropy in [Dy(MeDPQ)2Cl3], with the Curie&#8208;Weiss temperature &#952; being &#8722;3.69&#160;&#177;&#160;0.03&#160;K. Complexes of Ho3+ and Er3+ exhibited f&#8211;f emission in the visible range, while the latter was also emissive in the NIR. Dilution of the Dy3+ complex with diamagnetic Y3+ ions resulted in alterations of magnetic and photophysical properties. The substituted complexes Y0.5Dy0.5 and Y0.9Dy0.1 demonstrated paramagnetic behavior, with &#952; being 3.06&#160;&#177;&#160;0.12&#160;K and 9.64&#160;&#177;&#160;0.23&#160;K, respectively. In both cases, the emission decay times of Dy3+ changed insignificantly, 21.02&#160;&#177;&#160;0.41 &#181;s and 14.56&#160;&#177;&#160;0.22 &#181;s, respectively, compared to the value (18.92&#160;&#177;&#160;0.03 &#181;s) of the individual Dy3+ complex. Additional ligand&#8208;based emission bands were observed in the Ho3+ and Er3+ complexes at room temperature and 77&#160;K and in the substituted complexes Ho0.5Dy0.5 and Er0.5Dy0.5 at room temperature, which were assigned to the exciplex states. The thermal stability of [Er0.5Dy0.5(MeDPQ)2Cl3] was determined to be the same as for the individual complexes, starting to oxidize at 410&#176;C.

Mixed alkali metals, potassium and additional&#160;rubidium or cesium, allow for the synthesis of a straightforward, electron&#8208;precise Zintl phase K7&#8722;xAxTl5. The new phase is characterized by SCXRD, PXRD, and DFT. Its metastability is proven by DSC measurements. Dissolution experiments in liquid ammonia show the oxidation of K7&#8722;xAxTl5 to elemental thallium, while 205Tl NMR allowed for the detection of the first signal derived by dissolution of a thallide in liquid ammonia.








Abstract
In alkali metal thallides, a huge variety of thallium clusters can be realized, which are surrounded only by alkali metals. In most cases, different cluster types are present in the crystal structures at the same time. One example is the [Tl5]7&#8722; trigonal bipyramid, which has only been observed beside [Tl9]9&#8722;, [Tl4]8&#8722;, [Tl3]7&#8722;, [Tl]5&#8722;, or [Tl8Cd3]10&#8722;. In the new ternary alkali metal thallide phase K7&#8722;xAxTl5 (A&#160;=&#160;Rb, Cs; 0&#160;&lt;&#160;x&#160;&#8804;&#160;2.35), exclusively [Tl5]7&#8722; clusters are present, and the compound can be described as a salt&#8208;like Zintl&#8208;phase, where the electron count is balanced in terms of the anionic moiety and counter cations. This phase crystallizes in the orthorhombic noncentrosymmetric space group Ama2. Different temperature programs applied during synthesis suggested metastability, which was subsequently proven by DSC measurements. DFT calculations reveal a minimum in the DOS at EF and support the salt&#8208;like description. Dissolution experiments in the style of well&#8208;known group 14 and group 15 solution chemistry in liquid ammonia were performed and showed oxidation of the alkali metal thallide. Initial 205Tl NMR studies in liquid ammonia allow for the detection of the first signal of a dissolved thallium species emerging from a thallide Zintl phase.

         <title>London Dispersion versus Intramolecular Hydrogen Bond in Bis&#8208;Pyridines: How Accurate Is DFT for Competing Noncovalent Interactions in the Condensed Phase?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A test system of 14 singly protonated bis&#8209;pyridine salts, with varying H&#8209;bonded and London dispersion interactions, was designed to systematically study non&#8209;covalent interactions across the gas, solution, and solid phases. A good correlation between the 1H chemical shift and the N&#8208;H&#8211;N angle from the crystal structures was established. We observed systematic discrepancies in the treatment of these interactions by DFT&#8209;D3/D4 across the phases.








Abstract
We report a systematic investigation of noncovalent interactions&#8212;particularly an intramolecular hydrogen bond and London Dispersion forces&#8212;in singly protonated bis&#8208;pyridines, studied across solution and crystalline states. Building on our previous gas&#8208;phase study, we combine variable&#8208;temperature 1H NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The measured 1H NMR chemical shifts of the acidic proton serve as a solution&#8208;phase structural readout, which we correlate with an independent crystallographic metric. By systematically varying the linker (&#8211;CH2&#8211;, &#8211;O&#8211;, and &#8211;CH2CH2&#8211;) and the pendant substituents (H, methyl, tert&#8208;butyl), we examine how increasingly bulky &#8220;dispersion energy donors&#8221; affect both the intramolecular hydrogen bond and the accessible conformational states. In reference systems, where a single noncovalent interaction governs the geometry, even relatively simple computational models correctly reproduce the experimentally observed structures. However, for molecules featuring two competing noncovalent interactions, the tested, dispersion&#8208;corrected, DFT often fails to predict the relative energies of accessible conformers accurately, highlighting current limitations in predictive accuracy. We briefly discuss broader implications of currently achievable predictive accuracy for homogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Enantioselective Route to Terminal 2,3&#8208;Epoxy Tosylates Enabled by Cooperative Organocatalytic Desymmetrization of 2&#8208;Substituted Glycerol Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A desymmetrization strategy from bis tosylated 2&#8208;substituted glycerols to challenging 2,2&#8208;disubstituted 2,3&#8208;epoxy tosylates has been developed using commercial L&#8208;diphenyl prolinol/(R,R)&#8208;TADDOL system or the enantiomeric catalytic couple. (R)&#8208; or (S)&#8208; epoxides are obtained in moderate to good yield and up to 76% ee. Useful elaborations to functionalized products and remarkably to privileged eight&#8208; and four&#8208;membered aza&#8208;heterocycles, were demonstrated.








Abstract
A first enantioselective synthesis of challenging 2,2&#8208;disubstituted 2,3&#8208;epoxy tosylates has been developed via an organocatalytic desymmetrization reaction of bis tosylated 2&#8208;substituted glycerols. The intramolecular nucleophilic substitution has been cooperatively catalyzed by commercially available mixtures of L&#8208;diphenyl prolinol and (R,R)&#8208;&#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8217;,&#945;&#8217;&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;2,2 disubstituted 1,3&#8208;dioxolane&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethanol (TADDOL) or the enantiomeric couple, leading to (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;epoxides in up to 87% yield and 76% ee. Reaction monitoring highlighted the double role of leaving group and nucleophile played by the p&#8208;toluensulfonate anion, which was found to be responsible of epoxide ring&#8208;opening back to the reagent. The latter process affects the conversion to the epoxide, but marginally the enantioselectivity. These uncommon epoxides, bearing a quaternary stereocenter, demonstrated to be versatile intermediates to prepare functionalized products and remarkably, privileged eight&#8208; and four&#8208; membered N&#8208;heterocycles.

         <title>Asymmetric Ligand Field Effects in Electron&#8208;Rich Heterometallic Extended Metal Atom Chain Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of multimetallic compounds with modifiable scaffolding ligands raises questions about the distribution of electronic effects in heterometallic systems. Here we investigate the asymmetry of the substituent effects in a modified 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyradylamine ligand applied to a heterotrimetallic extended metal atom chain (HEMAC) framework. We find that the Mo2 core experiences a stronger effect than the heterometal, counter to expectations based on metal atom electronegativity.








Abstract
In heterometallic systems, electron donation from the ligands may influence the metal atoms in either a symmetric or asymmetric way, with the expected case being that the more electronegative metal is favored. Here, we describe a systematic study of heterometallic compounds where this expectation is not observed. In this study, we use a modification of the symmetric 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridylamine (dpa) ligand with electron donating ethyl groups, the 4,4&#8242;&#8208;diethyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridylamine ligand (dedpa), to prepare heterometallic extended metal atom chain (HEMAC) complexes with formula Mo2M&#8242;(dedpa)4Cl2 (M&#8242; = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni). The effects of the electron donating substituents were studied through techniques including crystallography, magnetometry, cyclic voltammetry, EPR, M&#246;ssbauer, electronic absorption spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. We find that the new HEMACs are indeed more electron rich, easier to oxidize, and, most interestingly, the impact of the ethyl substituents is not applied equally to all the metals in the chain. The ligand field is stronger at the Mo2 site, but is surprisingly weaker at the M&#8242; center when compared to Mo2M&#8242;(dpa)4Cl2 complexes. We also find that changing the ligand field allows for previously unassigned electronic transitions to become visible, including excitations tentatively assigned to a triplet &#948;&#8208;&#948;* state within the Mo2 unit.

Abstract
An ionic liquid consisting of a 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) radical anion and a tetra&#8208;n&#8208;octylphosphonium ion, 1+&#8226;TCNQ&#8226;&#8722;, undergoes a transformation near room temperature from paramagnetic liquid to diamagnetic solid accompanied by significant changes in photophysical properties. A blue solid of 1+&#8226;TCNQ&#8226;&#8722; melts upon heating above 328&#160;K, yielding a green liquid. The green liquid exhibits a magnetic susceptibility of 5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 emu mol&#8722;1. Upon cooling, the liquid retains its paramagnetic properties until the temperature reaches approximately 300&#160;K. Upon further cooling below 300&#160;K, the paramagnetic liquid reverts to the initial blue solid. The solid form of 1+&#8226;TCNQ&#8226;&#8722; exhibits near&#8208;zero magnetic susceptibility. The thermal hysteresis loop with magnetic bistability is observed without decomposition over the temperature range from 300 to 328&#160;K. Crystal structure analysis, electron spin resonance (ESR), and electronic spectra indicate that the drastic changes in magnetic properties are attributable to the reversible &#960;&#8208;dimerization of TCNQ&#8226;&#8722; species during the solid&#8211;liquid/liquid&#8211;solid phase transitions. Additionally, the association/dissociation behaviors of the TCNQ&#8226;&#8722; dimers also induce significant changes in photophysical properties, especially in the short&#8208;wave infrared region (1000&#8211;2500&#160;nm), suggesting the potential application of 1+&#8226;TCNQ&#8226;&#8722; as a bifunctional material.

         <title>Substitution of CH3 by CH2F in 2&#8208;Methylerythritol Cyclodiphosphate Triggers Potent Inhibition of IspG with Concomitant Fluoride Ion Expulsion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluoromethyl analogue of MEcPP was identified as a very potent inhibitor of the oxygen&#8208;sensitive [4Fe&#8208;4S] metalloenzyme IspG. In the course of the IspG&#8208;catalyzed transformation, this novel compound undergoes fluoride elimination, offering additional evidence for the involvement of a carbanionic intermediate in the mechanism of this enzyme.








Abstract
IspG (also known as GcpE) is a key [4Fe&#8208;4S] metalloenzyme that catalyzes the penultimate step of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, a well&#8208;established target for the development of new antimicrobials. This oxygen&#8208;sensitive enzyme mediates the reductive dehydroxylation of 2&#8208;C&#8208;methyl&#8208;d&#8208;erythritol 2,4&#8208;cyclodiphosphate (MEcPP) to (E)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;methylbut&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl diphosphate (HMBPP), requiring electron transfer proteins to deliver two electrons needed for catalysis. To probe the mechanism of IspG and access new mechanism&#8208;based inhibitors, we synthesized a substrate analogue, monofluoromethyl&#8208;d&#8208;erythritol cyclodiphosphate, in which the natural methyl group of MEcPP is replaced by a CH2F group. This analogue proved to be a potent inhibitor of IspG. This study also demonstrates that electron capture is a prerequisite for inhibition and that the inhibitor leads to fluoride release in the IspG&#8208;catalyzed reaction. Together, these results provide further support for the involvement of a carbanionic intermediate in the IspG mechanism.

         <title>Helical Polymer&#8208;Based Polycarboxylate as Chiral Ligands in Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical poly(quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl) bearing chiral carboxylic acid side chains forms a polycarboxylate that provides an asymmetric and hydrophobic environment in basic water. The polycarboxylate serves as an efficient ligand for copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder reactions in water, affording chiral products with up to 99% ee. Control experiments suggest the formation of dicarboxylate&#8211;copper complexes via inter&#8208;unit carboxylate coordination.








Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble poly(quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl)s (PQXlac) bearing chiral carboxylic acid side chains derived from l&#8208;lactic acid were used for Cu&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Diels&#8211;Alder reaction in water. The reaction of azachalcone with cyclopentadiene in the presence of PQXlac (1000mer, 1 mol% monomer unit) and Cu(NO3)2 (1 mol% Cu) proceeded at 5&#160;&#176;C in good yield with high enantioselectivity up to 99% ee. The utilization of the corresponding oligomers shorter than 10mer resulted in low chemical yield with low enantioselectivity, suggesting that a tight helical structure is essential for the formation of an effective catalyst. A comparison of the random and block copolymer of PQXlac and PQXteg, which has achiral tetra(ethylene glycol) side chains, indicated that block copolymer, in which the carboxylate groups are more densely packed, showed higher chemical yields along with higher enantioselectivity. These results suggest that the active catalyst has a copper dicarboxylate structure in which two carboxylate groups on every other monomer unit coordinate to the Cu center to form an effective chiral reaction environment.

         <title>A Simple Design of UV&#8208;curable Covalent Adaptive Networks Operated by Thiourea Bond Exchange</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple covalent adaptable network with a thiourea bond exchange mechanism is demonstrated. A feature is the use of thiol&#8208;ene UV&#8208;curing, realized through the synthesis of a diallyl monomer bearing thiourea units. The curing behavior, rheological properties, stress relaxation, and recyclability are evaluated, providing insights for straightforward yet versatile CAN design strategies.








Abstract
Using the concept of covalent adaptive networks (CANs), or vitrimers, sustainable and reprocessable cross&#8208;linked polymer materials can be developed. Advances in molecular design and understanding of the underlying physics are essential for translating such bond exchange concepts into practical applications. In this study, we demonstrate the design of a simple CAN system via UV&#8208;curing of a thiol&#8208;ene click reaction, where the network is formed by reacting telechelic allyl monomers with tri&#8208;functional thiol cross&#8208;linkers. The telechelic allyl monomer, containing thiourea bonds, is synthesized specifically for this purpose, with thiourea units acting as dynamic bond exchange sites within the network. Notably, this design offers broad tunability in the topological and chemical features, highlighting an important principle in the development of model CANs for physical property investigation. Here, we evaluate curing behavior, temperature&#8208;sweep rheological properties, stress relaxation, and recyclability for a representative formulation, providing insights into simple yet versatile design strategies.

         <title>Supramolecular 3D Polymers Created via Chalcogen Bonding Using Benzotellurazoles as Planar Recognition Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting with small planar benzotellurazoles, it is possible to create 3D supramolecular architectures. These exhibit a high degree of cross&#8208;linking, which is caused by various chalcogen bonding (ChB) motifs. Introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents onto the benzotellurazole makes the ChB motifs more apparent and results in more complex superstructures.








Abstract
In addition to hydrogen and halogen bonds, chalcogen bonds (ChBs) are gaining significance in the domain of crystal engineering. Nitrogen&#8208;containing tellurium compounds are well&#8208;suited for this purpose, as they form a variety of solid&#8208;state structures through ChBs. Despite prior studies addressing substituent effects in benzotellurazoles, the influence of fluorine atoms on the benzene backbone of 1,3&#8208;benzotellurazoles remains to be investigated in the context of solid&#8208;state arrangement. Here, we demonstrate that the incorporation of fluorine atoms can impact the nature and quantity of ChBs in the solid state. The electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of the introduced substituents result in alterations to the ChB donor (Te) and acceptor (N) properties, leading to a preferential interaction with competing Lewis bases such as carbonyl groups. A noteworthy exception was noticed for the derivatives with a nitrile group at position 2. Regardless of the number of fluorine atoms, a high degree of 3D cross&#8208;linking can be observed via a 5&#8208;ChBs&#8208;5&#8208;neighbors motif, including a characteristic two&#8208;lone&#8208;pair/one&#8208;&#963;&#8208;hole interaction. These findings offer valuable design principles for supramolecular materials, particularly in the context of crystal engineering.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Organic Phototheranostics: Matching Rotatable Donors and Shielding Acceptors for Enhanced Imaging and Phototherapy by Stabilized Triplet Excitons and Optimized Radiative Decay</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) organic phototheranostic agents (OPTAs) were constructed by molecular engineering of acceptor shielding and donor rotation. Notably, BPN&#8208;P nanoparticles (NPs) showed high NIR&#8208;II emission, good radical reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and a photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of 63%, achieving superior efficacy in NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;guided synergistic photodynamic/photothermal cancer therapy.








Abstract
Second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) organic phototheranostic agents (OPTAs) have received significant interests in cancer treatment by enabling precise positioning of deep&#8208;seated lesions and highly efficient ablation of tumors. However, competition between radiative and nonradiative pathways of the excitons sets great obstacles for obtaining robust OPTAs. Herein, we propose to fabricate high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;II OPTAs through molecular engineering of acceptor shielding units as well as manipulating molecular conformations by donor rotation. Accordingly, two series of OPTAs (BPN series: 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(ethene&#8208;1,1&#8208;diyl)bis(N,N&#8208;dimethylaniline) as rotatable donor and butadiene as &#960;&#8208;bridge, BPTQ series: julolidine as donor and 2&#8208;vinylthiophene as &#960;&#8208;bridge) with different acceptor shielding units were designed. Photophysical data and theoretical calculations verified the introduction of rotatable donors can help to realize highly twisted molecular conformations, resulting in enhanced NIR&#8208;II emission and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE). Moreover, the adoption of acceptor shielding units is advantageous for stabilizing triplet excitons for radical reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. As a result, a balance was achieved for BPN&#8208;P nanoparticles (NPs) in the BPN series, which exhibited high NIR&#8208;II emission, good radical ROS generation and highest PCE of 63%. BPN&#8208;P NPs achieved both high&#8208;resolution NIR&#8208;II angiography and imaging&#8208;guided synergistic photodynamic/photothermal cancer treatment in live mice model, showcasing the effectiveness of the strategy.

Herein, we propose to fabricate high-performance NIR-II OPTAs through molecular engineering of acceptor shielding units as well as manipulating molecular conformations by donor rotation. Accordingly, two series of OPTAs (BPN series: 4,4&#8242;-(ethene-1,1-diyl)bis(N,N-dimethylaniline) as rotatable donor and butadiene as &#960;-bridge, BPTQ series: julolidine as donor and 2-vinylthiophene as &#960;-bridge) with different acceptor shielding units were designed. Photophysical data and theoretical calculations verified the introduction of rotatable donors can help to realize highly twisted molecular conformations, resulting in enhanced NIR-II emission and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE). Moreover, the adoption of acceptor shielding units is advantageous for stabilizing triplet excitons for radical reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. As a result, a balance was achieved for BPN-P nanoparticles (NPs) in the BPN series, which exhibited high NIR-II emission, good radical ROS generation and highest PCE of 63%. BPN-P NPs achieved both high-resolution NIR-II angiography and imaging-guided synergistic photodynamic/photothermal cancer treatment in live mice model, showcasing the effectiveness of the strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
A green synthetic approach to planar hexacyclic indenoisoquinolinoquinolinamides was successfully accomplished via the [3&#160;+&#160;3] and [4&#160;+&#160;2] intramolecular cyclization between ene&#8208;yne&#8208;oxazolones and dihydroisoquinoline under neutral conditions, yielding products in good to excellent quantities. Some of the obtained compounds demonstrated promising anticancer activity against cholangiocarcinoma cells, mimicking those of lamellarins and azalamellarins by promoting apoptosis.








Abstract
A cascade cyclization of polycyclic indenoisoquinolinoquinolinamides has been realized via metal&#8208;free [3&#160;+&#160;3] and [4&#160;+&#160;2] intramolecular cyclization of ene&#8208;yne&#8208;oxazolones and dihydroisoquinoline under neutral conditions in good to excellent yield. In this process, three rings and four bonds are formed with high atom economy under reaction conditions that comply with green chemistry principles. The biological activity of the indenoisoquinolinoquinolinamide analogs, which mimic the structure of lamellarins&#8212;a group of marine natural products&#8212;was evaluated. The results indicated that these indenoisoquinolinoquinolinamide analogs exhibited notable anti&#8208;cancer activity, with cytotoxicity profiles comparable to those of their lamellarin counterparts.

         <title>Dual Excited&#8208;State Charge&#8208;Transfer Process in Luminescent Radicals with Spatially Folded Arrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report four donor&#8211;acceptor structured luminescent radicals in which spatial folding between carbazole and radical units induces a unique dual excited&#8208;state CT process involving both TBCT and TSCT. Systematic photophysical studies combined with theoretical calculations elucidate how these two CT pathways influence the emissive behaviors of the radicals.








Abstract
The through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) mechanism has attracted significant attention in closed&#8208;shell organic luminescent materials due to its strong environmental sensitivity, small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap, and high exciton utilization efficiency. However, open&#8208;shell luminescent radicals mostly adopt D&#8211;A or D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A skeletons to overcome the dark&#8208;state limitations of radicals, relying solely on a through&#8208;bond charge transfer (TBCT) process. To date, TSCT excited states in radical systems remain largely unexplored. In this study, we report the coexistence of TSCT and TBCT mechanisms in radical molecules. Four luminescent radicals (TB&#8208;MR, TB&#8208;DR, TBS&#8208;MR, and TBS&#8208;DR) were systematically investigated using absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations. The results reveal that the spatially folded conformation between carbazole units and radical centers in the TBS series induces abnormal photophysical behaviors deviating from conventional paradigms. Further electron&#8211;hole analysis indicates that the TBS series exhibits a dual excited&#8208;state charge transfer (CT) mechanism, with TSCT and TBCT contributions of approximately 70% and 30%, respectively. This discovery not only elucidates the influence of multiple CT processes on the excited&#8208;state behaviors of luminescent radicals but also establishes a novel excited&#8208;state engineering strategy for tuning the luminescence of open&#8208;shell systems.

         <title>Toward Non&#8208;Isocyanate Polyurethanes: Green Synthesis Routes and Recycling Technologies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In light of increasing environmental and regulatory pressures to minimize the use of isocyanates due to their toxicity, this paper comprehensively reviews current advances and future prospects in the synthesis and recycling of NIPUs, focusing on sustainable and environmentally friendly approaches. The review delves into innovative synthesis methodologies for NIPUs, highlighting green pathways while also addressing challenges related to end&#8208;of&#8208;life polyurethane management, with a focus on advancements in chemical recycling technologies.








Abstract
Polyurethanes (PUs) are extensively utilized polymers known for their excellent properties. However, the conventional synthesis of PUs heavily depends on toxic isocyanates, creating significant environmental and health risks. To mitigate these issues, research has increasingly focused on synthesizing non&#8208;isocyanate polyurethanes (NIPUs). This review systematically discusses the primary green synthesis routes for NIPUs: (1) Bis(dialkyl carbonate) route, (2) Transurethanization route, (3) Cyclic carbonate route, and (4) Ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) route. While PUs exhibit superior mechanical and chemical performance, their disposal at the end of life remains a major challenge. Currently, the main recovery methods include chemical degradation (or raw material recycling) and mechanical recycling, with chemical recycling offering potential for a closed&#8208;loop process. This review briefly summarizes these disposal strategies, aiming to encourage sustainable practices. It highlights recent advancements in green synthesis and recycling technologies, focusing on pathways for creating environmentally friendly and recyclable NIPUs. In light of increasing environmental and regulatory pressures to minimize the use of isocyanates due to their toxicity, this paper comprehensively reviews current advances and future prospects in the synthesis and recycling of NIPUs, focusing on sustainable and environmentally friendly approaches. The review delves into innovative synthesis methodologies for NIPUs, highlighting green pathways while also addressing challenges related to end&#8208;of&#8208;life polyurethane management, with a focus on advancements in chemical recycling technologies.

Abstract
The efficient development of electrocatalysts for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions has been greatly challenging due to the high stability of the N&#8801;N bond and the competitive interference from the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This work innovatively designs a graphitic carbon nitride substrate (g&#8208;C16N19) with a super&#8208;large pore structure based on the self&#8208;doping strategy and first&#8208;principles calculations, and constructs TM@g&#8208;C16N19 (TM&#160;=&#160;Ti &#8764; Au) single&#8208;atom catalyst systems. By establishing a &#8220;Four&#8208;Step&#8221; screening model, it is found that W@g&#8208;C16N19 exhibits the best NRR catalytic performance, with an ultralow limiting potential (UL) of &#8208;0.23&#160;V.

&lt;p&gt;The means of exploring the optimal catalyst.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The efficient development of electrocatalysts for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions has been greatly challenging due to the high stability of the N&#8801;N bond and the competitive interference from the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This work innovatively designs a graphitic carbon nitride substrate (g-C&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;) with a super-large pore structure based on the self-doping strategy and first-principles calculations, and constructs TM@g-C&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt; (TM&#160;=&#160;Ti &#8764; Au) single-atom catalyst systems. By establishing a &#8220;Four-Step&#8221; screening model, it is found that W@g-C&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits the best NRR catalytic performance, with an ultralow limiting potential (U&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) of -0.23&#160;V. Combining electron structure analyses such as charge density difference, ICOHP value, Bader charge, and spin magnetic moment, the micro-mechanism of W@g-C&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt; effectively activating the &#963;/&#960; bonds of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules through strong d-p orbital hybridization is revealed. Furthermore, based on the pH- and potential-dependent adsorption-free energy results calculated by the constant potential model, pH-potential coupling analysis shows that the configuration has a decisive influence on activity: the E-I/S-V mode dominates in alkaline media, while the E-O/S-O pathway is predominant under acidic conditions. In the E-I configuration, the energy barrier of the rate-determining step (PDS) of NRR decreases with the decrease of the electrode potential; conversely, the energy barrier of the PDS of NRR in the E-O/S-V/S-O configuration increases with the decrease of the electrode potential.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploring 4&#8208;Amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;Naphthalimides: Lifetime&#8208;Based Sensing of Chemical Micro&#8208;Environments</title>

         <dc:description>
We present a library of 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimides and evaluate their fluorescence lifetime responses to polarity and viscosity. Using fluorescence lifetime, we report polarity changes in rat serum during acute pancreatitis. These probes offer new tools for microenvironment sensing.








Abstract
Fluorescence lifetime offers a powerful approach to probe chemical microenvironments in biological systems, yet suitable fluorophores remain limited. Here, we report the synthesis and photophysical characterisation of a library of fifteen 4&#8208;amino&#8208;substituted 1,8&#8208;naphthalimides, incorporating diverse aliphatic and aromatic amines. These compounds exhibit strong solvatochromism and varied fluorescence lifetimes in response to polarity and viscosity. Notably, compound&#160;13&#160;demonstrates high brightness and pronounced fluorescence lifetime sensitivity to polarity, while compound&#160;17&#160;shows strong viscosity&#8208;dependent lifetime changes. We apply compound&#160;13&#160;to rat serum samples, revealing significant differences in fluorescence lifetime between healthy and acute pancreatitis conditions, consistent with polarity changes. In contrast, compound&#160;17&#160;showed no lifetime variation, suggesting limited viscosity changes in serum. These findings highlight the potential of 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimides as environment&#8208;sensitive probes, particularly for polarity sensing in complex biological samples. More generally, this work expands the photophysical understanding of naphthalimide derivatives and supports their application in fluorescence lifetime&#8208;based sensing of disease&#8208;related microenvironmental changes.

         <title>&#947;&#8208;Cyclodextrin&#8211;Imidazolium Salt&#8208;Based Bioinspired Nanoreactor: Enantioselective Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Arylation of Unprotected Isatin with Arylboronic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#947;&#8208;CD&#8211;NHC&#8211;Rh catalyst system was demonstrated to promote the arylation of unprotected isatins with arylboronic acids in aqueous ethanol with high efficiency and enantioselectivity. The enantioselectivity was largely independent of the H2O/ethanol solvent composition ratio, indicating a reaction mechanism involving intramolecular self&#8208;inclusion of the NHC&#8211;Rh complex intermediate within the &#947;&#8208;CD cavity tethered to the NHC ligand.








Abstract
The optically active 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole skeleton is a promising pharmacophore in drug design and has led to the development of metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reactions using designed chiral ligands for synthesizing 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles from isatins (2,3&#8208;oxindoles), 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles, and &#945;&#8208;ketoamides. Although the arylation of isatins is vital for convergent synthesis, most studies have used N&#8208;protected isatins, requiring the removal of protecting groups to obtain the desired bioactive products. Despite limited success in the direct high&#8208;enantioselective arylation of unprotected isatins (NH isatins), such arylation holds significant potential for improving atomic and synthetic efficiencies. In aqueous media, cyclodextrins (CDs) with hydrophobic and chiral cavities can selectively include organic compounds, making them potential nanoreactors for asymmetric reactions. In this study, imidazolium salts bearing a &#160;&#947;&#8208;CD were applied as N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands for the Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric arylation of NH isatins in environmentally benign aqueous ethanol. The arylation was successfully achieved in high yield and enantioselectivity using our &#947;&#8208;CD&#8211;NHC&#8211;Rh catalyst. This suggests that the arylation proceeds in the &#947;&#8208;CD cavity (host) through the self&#8208;inclusion of NHC&#9472;Rh complex intermediates (guests). These bio&#8208;inspired transition metal catalysts based on host&#8211;guest linkage systems are expected to contribute significantly to the development of efficient organic synthesis reactions with high enantioselectivity.

         <title>Enantiospecific Syntheses of Bicyclic Fragrance Molecules From Verbenone: Enhancing Odour Profiles and Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 6&#8208;step synthetic route has been developed for the synthesis of trans&#8208;fused bicyclic, nor&#8208;polywood derivatives using a ring&#8208;closing metathesis as the key step. These newly synthesized trans&#8208;decalin derivatives exhibited the characteristic woody odor of this class of compounds. The corresponding [6,7] and [6,5] derivatives have also been synthesized to compare their properties with the trans&#8208;decalin derivatives. All the products were obtained with a high degree of chirality starting from (&#8211;)&#8208;verbenone as the chiral pool starting material.








Abstract
Fragrances derived from terpenoid scaffolds continue to play a central role in the design of synthetic odorants, with trans&#8208;fused decalin system providing particularly valuable ambergris like woody notes. Inspired by the structural and stereochemical features of polywood and its analogues, we report herein a concise and versatile synthetic approach to novel bicyclic frameworks from the chiral pool precursor (&#8211;)&#8208;verbenone. An efficient, enantiospecific synthesis of trans&#8208;fused bicyclic fragrance molecules, including nor&#8208;polywood and novel [6,7]&#8208; and [6,5]&#8208;fused analogues, is reported. This six&#8208;step synthetic sequence utilized a powerful combination of conjugate addition, cyclobutane ring&#8208;opening, and a key Ring&#8208;Closing Metathesis (RCM) reactions. Subsequent stereoselective reductions, acetylations, and hydrogenations yield a diverse range of bicyclic frameworks in good overall yields with excellent stereocontrol. Importantly, olfactory evaluation confirms that all synthesized products retain the characteristic woody, amber&#8208;like notes of premium ambergris substitutes. These findings demonstrate the critical influence of ring&#8208;size variation on fragrance properties, providing new insights for the rational design of sophisticated odorants. This work not only provides an efficient synthesis of structurally diverse bicyclic systems but also expands the chemical space of ambergris&#8208;type odorants, offering new insights into structure&#8211;odour relationships for the development of next&#8208;generation woody fragrance ingredients.

         <title>Unlocking Diversity of Biologically Relevant Quinoline Scaffolds by Leveraging the Readily Available Feedstocks Under Cobalt&#8208;NHC Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study showcases a rare cobalt&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot green protocol that enables divergent open&#8208;air synthesis and functionalization of two quinoline frameworks starting from the simple, nonhalogenated, biomass&#8208;derived precursors to deliver six different quinoline derivatives, promising candidates for medicinal and material science applications.








Abstract
Quinolines are privileged heterocycles with widespread applications in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials science. However, sustainable and efficient one&#8208;pot methods for synthesizing and functionalizing quinolines, e.g., 2&#8208;methyl/aminoquinoline derivatives remained scarce.

&lt;p&gt;This study showcases a rare cobalt-catalyzed one-pot green protocol that enables divergent open-air synthesis and functionalization of two quinoline frameworks starting from the simple, nonhalogenated, biomass-derived precursors to deliver six different quinoline derivatives, promising candidates for medicinal and material science applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quinolines are privileged heterocycles with widespread applications in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials science. However, sustainable and efficient one-pot methods for synthesizing and functionalizing quinolines, e.g., 2-methyl/aminoquinoline derivatives remained scarce. Herein, we report a unified, green, and operationally simple one-pot strategy, which is enabled by a multitasking Co-NHC catalyst (&lt;b&gt;Co3&lt;/b&gt;). Starting from 2-aminobenzyl alcohol and acetone or benzyl nitrile as reactant, the present method achieves selective cyclization under open-air conditions to afford 2-methyl or 2-aminoquinolines, respectively. Remarkably, the same catalytic system enables divergent C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)-H functionalization's, including alkenylation, alkylation, dimerization, and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkylation in a single pot, yielding six structurally distinct quinoline classes. The protocol features broad substrate scope, excellent chemoselectivity, and high step economy, generating water and/or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as byproducts. Detailed mechanistic investigations, supported by control experiments, intermediate isolation, NMR/HRMS analysis, and DFT studies, reveal the dual catalytic role of the Co-NHC complex in both cyclization and subsequent transformations. Overall, the current cobalt-catalyzed platform paves the way for sustainable access to diverse quinoline architectures under mild and green conditions, relevant to drug discovery and advanced functional materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Toward Ultra&#8208;Narrowband Long&#8208;Wavelength Multiple&#8208;Resonance Emitters: Mechanistic Insights and Design Principles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the narrowband emission with high efficiency, multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials are crucial for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. This review provides an overview of the principles behind spectral narrowing in these emitters and also discusses the challenges and future prospects for achieving ultra&#8208;narrowband emission across the full visible spectrum.








Abstract
Multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) material represents a groundbreaking advancement in organic electronics, enabling ultra&#8208;narrowband emission with the enhanced efficiency and spectral accuracy. Leveraging the MR effect, MR&#8208;TADF materials inherently achieve narrow emission profiles that are crucial for High&#8208;definition display. These materials offer a significant advantage over traditional phosphorescence and TADF emitters, which enable high&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with intrinsically narrow emission spectra. However, realizing full&#8208;color ultra&#8208;narrowband emission is hindered by the intrinsic conflict between spectral tunability and narrowing of the emission bandwidth. Overcoming these challenges requires a deep understanding of the spectral narrowing mechanisms and the integration of precise molecular design strategies that balance efficiency, tunability, and emission purity. This review provides an overview of the principles behind spectral narrowing in boron/nitrogen&#8208;doped MR emitters, including the fundamental mechanisms, quantitative metrics, and recent breakthroughs. It also discusses the challenges and future prospects for achieving ultra&#8208;narrowband emission across the full visible spectrum, offering strategic guidance for the future development of OLED materials with enhanced color purity and performance.

         <title>Coping with the Blues: Simple and Photo&#8208;Stable Dye for Long&#8208;Term Live&#8208;Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PyPe is a fluorescent emitter with low photobleaching thanks to its vinyl moiety serving as a radiationless relaxation group. This favors the configuration flip between E&#8208; and Z&#8208;isomers at excited states and promotes photostability. Then, photodimers form in various kinetics and proportions depending on temperature and complexation. Low toxicity makes it a blue photostable dye, readily taken up by cells, and suitable for bioimaging experiments.








Abstract
Dyes for long&#8208;term imaging of live cells are rare, especially in the blue region, as they need to be nontoxic and photo&#8208;stable. New simple pyrene&#8208;derived dyes have been synthesized and fully characterized, showing good cellular uptake, intense emission, and excellent stability. Their unusual stability secret lies in their flexible conformation, evidenced by the solid&#8208;state structures of coordination compounds obtained from the dyes and by 1H&#8208;NMR solution studies. Results show that under irradiation, the pyrene&#8208;based dye undergoes intersystem crossing (ISC) that leads to a configurational switching occurring at time scales that are faster than the formation of possible photobleaching products. Irradiation of these dyes over 24&#160;hours shows great photostability that was evaluated in different solvents. The possible mechanism of the stability of these dyes is discussed here. Being nontoxic and emitting at only a specific wavelength, these compounds are perfect for staining the cytosol of live cells and long&#8208;term imaging in parallel with other dyes of different colors.

         <title>Synthesis of Dithienylcycloalkene Molecular Switches Enabled by a Bench&#8208;Stable Ti&#8208;Complex</title>

Herein we report a set of cycloalkene&#8208;bridged DTEs with ring sizes ranging from 4&#8208; to 7&#8208;membered rings. The synthesis of these analogs was performed via a key McMurry coupling step, which was enabled by a practical, bench&#8208;stable Ti(IV)&#8208;complex. Remarkably, it is shown that the strained cyclobutene bridge outperforms other rings, even the most commonly featured cyclopentene, in terms of reversibility and fatigue resistance.








Abstract
Herein, we report a set of cycloalkene&#8208;bridged dithienylethene (DTE) molecular switches with ring sizes ranging from 4&#8208; to 7&#8208;membered rings. These analogs were accessed via McMurry carbonyl coupling using a bench&#8208;stable Ti(IV)&#8208;complex reagent instead of the generally applied fuming, liquid TiCl4, making the synthesis more practical and reproducible. The efficiency of the reaction was dependent on the ring size, providing the lowest yield for the largest, 7&#8208;membered ring. Structures having 3&#8208;membered cyclopropene bridges were prepared using an alternative strategy. Remarkably, the comparison of the photoswitching properties of the series showed that molecules bearing a strained cyclobutene bridge outperform the other switches in terms of reversibility and fatigue resistance.

         <title>Nitrogen Donor Ligand (&#945;&#8208;Diamine vs. &#945;&#8208;Diimine) Makes Big Differences in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Ethylene (Co)Polymerization</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of &#945;&#8208;diamine palladium complexes with two sp3 hybridized N donors has been synthesized and characterized. In comparision to classic &#945;&#8208;diimine palladium analogues, the variation from imine donor to amine donor makes big differences in complex configuration and catalytic properties toward ethylene (co)polymerization.








Abstract
The nitrogen donor atom is widely used in the design and synthesis of olefin polymerization catalysts, while the amine donor featured sp3 hybridized N is less applied in the ligand design than the imine donor featured sp2 hybridized N. We have herein reported the synthesis and characterization of &#945;&#8208;diamine palladium complexes with two sp3 hybridized N donors and their catalytic properties toward homopolymerization of ethylene and copolymerization of ethylene with methyl acrylate (MA). The X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses identify that the &#945;&#8208;diamine palladium complexes have a significantly distorted chelate ring (N&#9472;C&#9472;C&#9472;N&#9472;Pd), which is distinct from conventional &#945;&#8208;diimine palladium complexes with a planar chelate ring. Ethylene polymerization results elucidate that bulky steric hindrance of the &#945;&#8208;diamine palladium catalyst is required to achieve high activity and high molecular weight polymer. Comparisons of ethylene (co)polymerization results between the &#945;&#8208;diamine palladium catalyst and the classic &#945;&#8208;diimine palladium analogue disclose that the variation from imine donor to amine donor makes a decreasing change in catalytic activity and polymer molecular weight but an increase in the degree of linearity of polymeric product and MA incorporation in EMA copolymer.

We demonstrate a sustainable strategy for pharmaceutical manufacturing by combining hydrogen, heterogeneous catalysis, and continuous flow synthesis. The development of novel catalysts and their application in a multi&#8208;step synthesis of donepezil enabled a highly productive process with no intermediate purification. This work establishes a new, greener pathway for a hydrogen&#8208;powered, carbon&#8208;neutral future.








Abstract
Conventional pharmaceutical manufacturing relies on fossil fuels and inefficient batch processes, creating significant waste. This review presents a strategy using hydrogen, heterogeneous catalysts, and continuous&#8208;flow synthesis for a more sustainable and efficient approach to pharmaceutical manufacturing. We detail two key innovations: first, highly efficient catalysts (Pt/C and polysilane&#8208;modified Pd) for atom&#8208;economical C&#9472;N bond formation. Our flow systems offered superior performance and broad functional group tolerance. Second, we developed a robust polysilane&#8208;immobilized Rh&#8208;Pt bimetallic catalyst for selective arene hydrogenation under mild conditions. We successfully integrated these technologies into a seamless, multi&#8208;step continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of donepezil. By successfully integrating these technologies and overcoming challenges like catalyst inhibition, this work demonstrates a highly productive and sustainable process. This approach represents a significant step toward a greener, hydrogen&#8208;powered future for chemical manufacturing.

In this study, chiral spiro[furo[2,3&#8208;d]pyrimidines] are synthesized by integrating two biologically active heterocyclic scaffolds, furo[2,3&#8208;d]pyrimidines and oxindoles, in a single molecule in the presence of quinine&#8208;derived squaramide through Cascade Michael&#8208;Cyclopropanation&#8208;Rearrangement. Structurally diverse spiro[furo[2,3&#8208;d]pyrimidines] with excellent yield and selectivity demonstrating the efficacy and versatility of the protocol. 1H NMR and HRMS titrations support the proposed mechanism.








Abstract
An unprecedented organocatalytic enantioselective methodology has been unlocked to access oxindole&#8208;fused spiro[furo[2,3&#8208;d]pyrimidines] with high bond efficiency (two new C&#8208;C bonds and one C&#8208;O bond) and two contiguous stereocenters via Cascade Michael&#8208;Cyclopropanation&#8208;Rearrangement. A series of spiro[furo[2,3&#8208;d]pyrimidines] has been synthesized in excellent yield (up to 90%) and stereoselectivity (dr up to 99:1, er up to 97:3) from 3&#8208;chlorooxindoles and 5&#8208;alkylidene barbituric acids at room temperature. 1H NMR and HRMS studies have been conducted to define the reaction pathway.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Analysis of Phenolic Phytoprostanes, Oxidized Derivatives of Lipophenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of four hydroxytyrosol&#8208;phytoprostanes (PhytoPs&#8208;HT) was achieved in 20 steps, enabling their first identification as HT&#8208;&#945;&#8208;linolenate oxidation products. This work revealed new oxidized derivatives of lipophenols via UHPLC&#8208;MS/MS analysis, offering a strategy to trace HT&#8208;derived compounds in complex matrices, aiding food and biomedical research.








Abstract
Lipophenols, or phenolipids, are compounds that combine polyphenols with fatty acids, offering the antioxidant properties of polyphenols alongside the neuroprotective and cardioprotective benefits of omega&#8208;3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Hydroxytyrosol (HT)&#8208;based lipophenols have recently been identified in olive oil. Depending on their structure, these compounds were differently affected by storage conditions. While the concentrations of HT&#8208;oleate and HT&#8208;linoleate increase with higher storage temperatures, HT&#8208;&#945;&#8208;linolenate (HT&#8208;ALA) did not follow the same trend. Given the high oxidative susceptibility of &#945;&#8208;linolenic acid (ALA), which leads to oxidation products known as phytoprostanes (PhytoPs), we hypothesize that HT&#8208;ALA may be oxidized into covalently bound PhytoP conjugates of HT (PhytoPs&#8208;HT) under various oxidative conditions, including, for example, suboptimal storage. This study aims to develop the first total synthesis of two series of PhytoPs&#8208;HT as analytical standards to explore the oxidative transformation of HT&#8208;ALA lipophenols into potential oxylipin metabolites. The synthesis of four ALA&#8208;derived PhytoPs&#8208;HT and their identification during in vitro oxidation of HT&#8208;ALA by UHPLC&#8208;HRMS/MS are presented here. These synthetic standards are essential for the reliable identification and quantification of HT&#8208;PhytoPs within complex mixtures of regio&#8208; and stereoisomers generated during oxylipin formation.

         <title>Methyl on the Bridge: 2&#8208;Methyl Propellane as Precursor for 1,3&#8208;Substituted 2&#8208;Methylated Bicyclo[1.1.1]Pentanes</title>

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of 2&#8208;methyl propellane and its conversion to various 1,2&#8208; and 1,2,3&#8208;di&#8208; and trisubstituted bicyclopentanes is reported.








Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) have emerged as isosteric replacements for mono&#8208; and para&#8208;substituted benzene rings in medicinal and materials applications, involving substitution at the BCP bridgehead (1,3&#8208;positions). BCP functionalization at the 2&#8208;position is much less straightforward and currently under intense investigation. Herein, we report a synthetic route to 2&#8208;methyl BCPs allowing for functionalization at the 1,3&#8208;positions, with the novel 2&#8208;methyl[1.1.1]propellane as a key intermediate. Next to an optimization for the synthesis of 2&#8208;Me&#8208;propellane, this work contains an investigation of its reactivity leading to 1,2&#8208;disubstituted and 1,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted BCP derivatives. Compared to nonsubstituted propellane, the synthesis of 2&#8208;methyl propellane was lower&#8208;yielding, and its ring&#8208;opening reactions proceeded in similar or lower yields, with radical&#8208;based reactions generally giving the best results. A preliminary study of selected physicochemical properties was conducted to assess the impact of the introduction of a bridge&#8208;methyl group, showing an expected increase of about 0.5 logP units and featuring lower melting points.

         <title>Narrowband Tetradentate Pt(II) Complexes&#8208;Based Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs with Low Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient deep&#8208;blue OLEDs using two tetradentate Pt(II) complexes as emitters are fabricated, which exhibit narrow emission spectra with full&#8208;width at half maximum (FWHM) of 25 and 26&#160;nm, respectively, resulting in small CIEy values &lt; 0.15. The OELDs also show low efficiency roll&#8208;off of 8.3% and 8.0% at 1000&#160;cd/m2, respectively.








Abstract
This study designed and synthesized two tetradentate Pt(II) complexes featured with aryl&#8208; modified N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, PtTJ&#8208;Ph and PtTJ&#8208;bPh, which exhibited narrow emission spectra with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 19.0 and 19.8&#160;nm in dichloromethane, respectively. They also showed remarkably high photoluminescence quantum yields of 99% and 93%, along with short excited&#8208;state lifetimes of 2.72 &#181;s and 2.34 &#181;s in poly(methyl methacrylate (PMMA) films, respectively. Deep&#8208;blue OLED device using PtTJ&#8208;Ph as emitter exhibited narrowband emission spectrum peaking at 458&#160;nm with a small FWHM value of 25&#160;nm, resulting in a small Commission Internationale de l'&#201;clairage (CIE) y coordinate of 0.138. The device also achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.7%, and maintained an EQE of 20.8% at 1000&#160;cd/m2 with a low efficiency roll&#8208;off of only 8.3%, demonstrating excellent electroluminescent properties for deep&#8208;blue OLED application.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Carbon Dots as Photon&#8208;Triggered Pyroptosis Inducers for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept article highlights the recent developments in the field of PTP using nonmetallic nanomaterials that have photocatalytic properties and can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, it aims to offer a systematic overview of the progression and utilization of nonmetallic carbon dots in PTP, thereby contributing to the renewed comprehension of their applications and potential in cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Pyroptosis, a highly immunogenic form of programmed cell death, is characterized by the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Recently, researchers have focused on the use of light to control pyroptosis induction, an approach that holds great promise as being relatively noninvasive and allows for precise spatiotemporal control. Photon&#8208;triggered pyroptosis (PTP) has made great progress in cancer immunotherapy. This concept article highlights the recent developments of metal&#8208;free nanomaterials (especially carbon dots) mediated&#8208;PTP, including the synthetic routes, their photophysical properties and applications in the area of cancer immunotherapy.

The phosphorus compounds bearing a NCN&#8208;type pincer ligand, the 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene ligand (BZIMB), were synthesized and characterized using spectroscopic methods. Compared with the P&#9472;N bond in topologically related compounds bearing an NNN&#8208;type pincer ligand, the robust P&#9472;C bond allows reactions with various reagents, leading to phosphorus compounds in different oxidation states without dissociation of the phosphorus atom.








Abstract
A series of phosphorus compounds bearing the 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene ligand (BZIMB) were prepared and fully characterized using spectroscopic methods, including X&#8208;ray crystallography. Reaction of the PIII compounds with electrophilic reagents led to PV compounds. Reaction with reducing reagents led to PI phosphinidenes. The phosphinidenes react with electrophilic reagents to generate new PIII compounds. In contrast to topologically related compounds featuring labile P&#9472;N bonds, the robust P&#9472;C bond between the phosphorus center and the ligand prevents dissociation of the phosphorus atom during oxidation and reduction, showing the potential for small molecule activation and opening the door for future catalytic studies.

         <title>A General Synthesis Approach to Double&#8208;Guanidinium Stapled Peptides and Foldamers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our previous guanidinium stapling strategy has been extended to the generation of bis&#8208;guanidinium stapled peptides and foldamers. This rapid and efficient approach, developed on solid&#8208;support, allows for easy modulation of the ring size and the nature of the linker to reach high affinity hDM2 binders.








Abstract
In the broader context of peptide macrocyclization, methods enabling the formation of specific crosslinks between orthogonally protected, amino&#8208;functionalized side chains (e.g., Lys&#8211;Lys crosslinks) are of potential interest for expanding molecular diversity and stabilizing peptide secondary structures. We recently introduced a solid&#8208;phase synthesis approach for the rapid generation of guanidinium stapled helical peptides and have shown their utility for inhibition of protein&#8211;protein interactions. Whereas our previous work concentrated on the formation of mono&#8208;guanidinium crosslinks, we show here that we can expand this approach to prepare bis&#8208;guanidinium stapled peptides and foldamers on&#8208;resin. The methodology similarly uses two orthogonally protected amino&#8208;functionalized side chains and features the use of a diamino connector. The two guanidinium groups are introduced sequentially, the first one intermolecularly and the second intramolecularly. The method is compatible with the i,i&#160;+&#160;4 and i,i&#160;+&#160;7 cyclization schemes and tolerates a diversity of diamino linkers. We applied the strategy to the synthesis of macrocyclic inhibitors of hDM2 and hDMX and identified several high affinity binders for the two proteins.

         <title>T&#189; Tuning in a Synergistic BODIPY&#8208;Tetrazole Fe(II) Spin&#8208;Crossover&#8208;Photoluminescence System via Co&#8208;Ligand Variation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a modular spin crossover&#8208;photoluminescence (SCO&#8208;PL) system: heteroleptic, mononuclear Fe(II) coordination compounds bearing equatorial BODIPY fluorophores that exhibit synergistic PL response upon spin state switching. Exchanging apical nitrile co&#8208;ligands tunes electronic and structural properties, giving precise control over the SCO and PL response. This versatile SCO&#8208;PL platform offers bifunctional behavior for photonic applications.








Abstract
Bifunctional materials combining spin crossover (SCO) and photoluminescence (PL), offering noncontact and highly sensitive spin&#8208;state detection, are promising candidates for application in photonic devices. However, independently tuning the SCO and PL properties to achieve synergistic SCO&#8208;PL behavior remains challenging. Herein, we present a series of heteroleptic Fe(II) coordination compounds with the general formula [Fe(L)4(RCN)2](ClO4)2&#8226;nRCN, bearing four BODIPY&#8208;derived fluorophores L (L&#160;=&#160;4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3,5,7&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;8&#8208;[(1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methyl]&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene) in the equatorial positions and variable RCN co&#8208;ligands (CH3CH2CN, CH2CHCN, CH3(CH2)2CN, PhCN) in the apical positions. The systematic variation of the co&#8208;ligand modulates steric and/or electronic effects, thereby influencing the SCO behavior without perturbing the PL characteristics. Magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed T1/2 =&#160;220&#160;K and 270&#160;K for R&#160;=&#160;CH3CH2 and R&#160;=&#160;CH2CH, respectively, indicating that electronic effects modulate T1/2. Conversely, for R&#160;=&#160;Ph and R&#160;=&#160;CH3(CH2)2 the SCO capability is progressively lost, with the latter showing no spin&#8208;switching at all. Temperature&#8208;dependent PL studies display an increase in emission upon the SCO, most pronounced for [Fe(L)4(CH3CH2CN)2](ClO4)2&#8226;2CH3CH2CN, which can be attributed to electronic coupling between the SCO center and the fluorophore. This work establishes a single&#8208;molecule SCO&#8208;PL platform, in which the SCO behavior can be tuned independently from the PL response, paving the way for tailored molecular sensors and optical switches.

         <title>Proton Conductivities of Stepwise Protonated Imidazole&#8208;Fused Tetraphenylene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton conducting tetraphenylene molecules (ImTP) containing a imidazole group were controlled by the degree of protonation. By controlling the degree of protonation from neutral ImTP to H1ImTP&#8314;, H2ImTP2&#8314;, and H4ImTP&#8308;&#8314;, we demonstrated that the balance between intermolecular hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions affects structural stability and proton conductivity.

X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that neutral ImTP forms a 2D hydrogen bond network, while H1ImTP&#8314; exhibits enhanced structural stability due to N&#9472;H&#8314;&#183;&#183;&#183;Cl&#8722; electrostatic interactions. H2ImTP2&#8314; forms a 3D network, and H4ImTP&#8308;&#8314; becomes amorphous. Under 40% relative humidity conditions, these compounds adsorb H2O to form proton conduction pathways, exhibiting conductivities of 3.20&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;7, 3.38&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6, 1.35&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6, and 6.20&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6 S cm&#8722;1 at &#8764;363&#160;K for n&#160;=&#160;0, 1, 2, and 4 of HnImTPn&#8314;Cl&#8722;n system, respectively. In particular, H1ImTP&#8314; exhibits an optimal balance between hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, resulting in high structural stability, reversible H2O adsorption, and proton conductivity.

Natural rhodochrosite as a catalyst with unique activity in methane oxidation.








Abstract
Rhodochrosite, a naturally occurring MnCO3${\rm MnCO}_3$&#8208;based mineral with inherent compositional complexity, is investigated as a catalyst for methane oxidation. The material exhibits distinctive catalytic behavior, including enhanced C2${\rm C}_2$ hydrocarbon formation and selective CO production, attributed to its multielemental composition and dynamic phase transformations under reaction conditions. In particular, rhodochrosite suppresses CO formation while enhancing C2H4${\rm C}_2{\rm H}_4$ production compared to pure MnCO3${\rm MnCO}_3$, the primary component of rhodochrosite. Thermal treatment converts rhodochrosite into mixed manganese oxide phases (Mn2O3${\rm Mn}_2{\rm O}_3$, Mn3O4${\rm Mn}_3{\rm O}_4$), while trace elements and mineral impurities are retained and may influence oxide phase evolution and catalytic behavior. These findings highlight the potential of natural multicomponent minerals as compositionally diverse, phase&#8208;adaptive platforms for selective methane&#160;conversion.
