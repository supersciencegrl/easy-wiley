         <title>Multi&#8208;Resonant Thermally Activated Delayed&#160;Fluorescent (MR&#8208;TADF) Compounds as Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) compounds, such as 4CzIPN, have become a widely used sub&#8208;class of organic photocatalysts for a plethora of photocatalytic reactions. Multi&#8208;resonant TADF (MR&#8208;TADF) compounds, a subclass of TADF emitters that are rigid nanographene derivatives, such as DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa, have to date not been explored as photocatalysts. In this study both DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa were found to give comparable or better product yield than 4CzIPN in a range of photocatalytic processes that rely upon reductive quenching, oxidative quenching, energy transfer and dual photocatalytic processes. In a model oxidative quench process, DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa gave increased reaction rates in comparison to 4CzIPN, with DiKTa being of particular interest due to the lower material cost (&#163;0.94/mmol) compared to that of 4CzIPN (&#163;3.26/mmol). These results suggest that DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa would be excellent additions to any chemist&#8217;s collection of photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Transformations of Strained Three&#8208;Membered Rings a Common, Yet Overlooked, Motif in Heavy&#8208;Atom Tunneling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 56, October 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tunnel vision: The (trans)formation of three&#8208;membered rings is identified as a motif present in the majority of computationally and experimentally studied examples of heavy&#8208;atom tunneling. The reasons for this phenomenon are analyzed through a survey of different types of ring transformations throughout the tunneling literature.







Abstract
Quantum mechanical tunneling has long been recognized as an important phenomenon when considering transformations dominated by a lightweight hydrogen atom. Tunneling of heavier atoms like carbon, initially dismissed as negligible, has seen a quickly increasing number of computationally predicted and/or experimentally confirmed examples over the last decade, thus highlighting its importance for a wide variety of reactions. However, no common structural motif has been pointed out within these seemingly unconnected examples, strongly limiting the predictability of the impact of heavy&#8208;atom tunneling on a given reaction. This Concept article will provide this perspective and showcase how the recognition of the formation and cleavage of three&#8208;membered rings as common motif can inform the prediction of and research into heavy&#8208;atom tunneling reactions.

         <title>Differentiable Formation of Chiroptical Lanthanide Heterometallic LnnLn&#8217;4&#8208;n(L6) (n=0&#8211;4) Tetrahedra with C2&#8208;Symmetrical Bis(tridentate) Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 56, October 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterometallic supramolecular tetrahedra can be prepared by self&#8208;assembly of lanthanide ions with ligand L followed by crystallization. Upon ether diffusion with a mixture of [Eu2L3] and [Gd2L3] helicates, a mixture of heterometallic EunGd&#8217;4&#8208;n(L6) (n=0&#8211;4) tetrahedra was prepared. Ligand L demonstrated preferential formation of heterometallic tetrahedron which is confirmed by MS deconvolution.







Abstract
Construction of lanthanide heterometallic complex is important for engineering multifunction molecular containers. However, it remains a challenge because of the similar ionic radii of lanthanides. Herein we attempt to prepare chiral lanthanide heterometallic tetrahedra. Upon crystallization with a mixture of [Eu2L3] and [Ln2L3] (Ln=Gd, Tb and Dy) helicates, a mixture of heterometallic EunLn&#8217;4&#8208;n(L6) (n=0&#8211;4) tetrahedra was prepared. Selective formation of heterometallic tetrahedron was observed as MS deconvolution results deviated from statistical results. The formation of heterometallic tetrahedron was found to be sensitive to ionic radii as well as the ratio of the two helicates used in the crystallization.

         <title>Triple Regioselective Functionalization of Cationic [4]Helicenes via Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Borylation and Suzuki Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactivity</title>

         <dc:description>
In essentially one&#8208;pot, using Ir&#8208; and Pd&#8208;catalysis, tris(arene)&#8208;functionalized cationic [4]helicenes are synthesized with full regioselectivity and enantiospecificity starting from a trivial precursor (17 examples). This poly&#8208;addition of aryl groups improves key optical properties, that is, fluorescence quantum yields and lifetimes. Electronic circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence signatures are observed up to the far&#8208;red domain, in particular with additional arenes prone to aggregation.

         <title>Monomeric Magnesium Catalyzed Alkene and Alkyne Hydroboration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 56, October 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monomeric magnesium methyl complex has been employed for alkene and alkyne hydroboration. The methodology has been extended towards terpenes. A detailed theoretical calculation has been provided to understand the mechanism.







Abstract
In this work, two monomeric magnesium alkyl complexes (1 and 2) were prepared using bis(phosphino)carbazole framework and among them 1 has been used as a catalyst for hydroboration of alkenes and alkynes with pinacolborane (HBpin). A broad variety of aromatic and aliphatic alkenes and alkynes were efficiently reduced. Anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioselective hydroboration of alkenes and alkynes was achieved, which was confirmed by deuterium&#8208;labelling experiments. The work represents the first example of the use of magnesium in homogeneous catalytic hydroboration of alkene with broad substrate scope. Experimental mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations provided insights into the reaction mechanism. Finally, the hydroboration protocol was extended to terpenes.

&lt;p&gt;In this work, two monomeric magnesium alkyl complexes (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) were prepared using bis(phosphino)carbazole framework and among them &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; has been used as a catalyst for hydroboration of alkenes and alkynes with pinacolborane (HBpin). A broad variety of aromatic and aliphatic alkenes and alkynes were efficiently reduced. Anti-Markovnikov regioselective hydroboration of alkenes and alkynes was achieved, which was confirmed by deuterium-labelling experiments. The work represents the first example of the use of magnesium in homogeneous catalytic hydroboration of alkene with broad substrate scope. Experimental mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations provided insights into the reaction mechanism. Finally, the hydroboration protocol was extended to terpenes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biohybrid Organic Heterostructure Based on Chlorophyll&#8208;Bacteriochlorophyll Aggregates for Ecofriendly Hydrogen Production</title>

In the present work, BChl&#8722;Chl&#8208;based organic heterojunction structures were introduced for visible light&#8208;driven photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production. At the same time, a novel BChl&#8722;Chl&#8208;based organic heterojunction noble metal&#8208;free BChl@Chl@Ti3C2Tx photocatalyst was successfully constructed by a simple alternating deposition process of Chl and BChl on Ti3C2Tx nanosheets.







Abstract
Hydrogen energy is an abundant, clean, sustainable and environmentally friendly renewable energy source. Therefore, the production of hydrogen by photocatalytically splitting water on semiconductors has been considered in recent years as a promising and sustainable strategy for converting solar energy into chemical energy to replace conventional energy sources and to solve the growing problem of environmental pollution and the global energy crisis. However, highly efficient solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen production remains a huge challenge due to the poor visible light response of available photocatalytic materials and the low efficiency of separation and transfer of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs. In the present work, organic heterojunction structures based on bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) and chlorophyll (Chl) molecules were introduced and used for solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen production from water under visible light. Also, noble metal&#8208;free photocatalyst was successfully constructed on Ti3C2Tx nanosheets by simple successive deposition of Chl and BChl, which was used for the photocatalytic splitting water to hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The results show that the optimal BChl@Chl@Ti3C2Tx composite has a high HER performance with 114&#8197;&#956;mol/h/gcat, which is much higher than the BChl@Ti3C2Tx and Chl@Ti3C2Tx composites.

         <title>Gel&#228;nder Molecules with Orthogonal Joints: Synthesis of Macrocyclic Dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 56, October 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design for &#8220;Gel&#228;nder&#8221; architectures is presented with orthogonal joints between axis, rungs, and banister. Following this design concept, two macrocyclic model compounds are synthesized, fully characterized, and separated into room temperature stable enantiomers with the banister helically wrapped around the axis.







Abstract
Orthogonal joints, understood as connections with an angle of 90&#176;, were introduced in the design of the &#8220;Gel&#228;nder&#8221; model compounds 1 and 2. The banister, consisting of a conjugated carbazole dimer linked by either 1,3&#8208;butadiyne (2) or a single thiophene (1), wraps around an axis composed of a phthalimide dimer due to the dimensional mismatch of both subunits, which are interconnected by phenylene rungs. The &#8220;Gel&#228;nder&#8221; structure was assembled from a monomer comprising the 1,4&#8208;diaminobenzene rung with one amino substituent as part of a 4&#8208;bromo phthalimide subunit forming the orthogonal junction to the axis, and the other as part of a masked 2&#8208;ethynyl carbazole as orthogonal joint to the banister. The macrocycle was obtained by two sequential homocoupling steps. A first dimerization by a reductive homocoupling assembled the axis, while an oxidative acetylene coupling served as ring&#8208;closing reaction. The formed butadiyne was further derivatized to a thiophene, rendering all carbons of the model compound sp2 hybridized. Both helical structures were fully characterized and chirally resolved. Assignment of the enantiomers was achieved by simulation of chiroptical properties and enantiopure synthesis.

Get into Gear: The Trost ligand series promotes the enantioselective allylation of &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoesters to generate 3&#8208;fluoropiperidines in up to 92&#8201;%&#8197;ee. We have employed the Lloyd&#8208;Jones Norrby model to explain the origins of enantiocontrol and propose that the catalyst backbone engenders a gearing effect whereby the ester adopts an s&#8208;trans conformation that enforces the alkene moiety of the enoate to adopt an s&#8208;cis orientation, thereby controlling facial to the &#960;&#8208;allyl complex.







Abstract
The first useful enantioselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation of &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoesters has been achieved using the Trost family of chiral ligands yielding products in up to 92&#8201;%&#8197;ee. This work provides new insights regarding the typically modest selectivities associated with acyclic &#945;&#8208;fluoroenolates and shows experimental evidence that the typically poor levels of enantiocontrol associated with these systems are not necessarily due to the presence of E/Z enolate mixtures. Finally, this methodology allows the easy preparation of useful 3&#8208;fluoropiperidine intermediates, and it is demonstrated that these systems are applicable to a range of functionalization reactions leading to new building blocks for the discovery of bioactive products.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Synthesis of Water&#8208;Soluble Gold Nanoparticles Stabilized by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes: From Structural Characterization to Applications</title>

Small water&#8208;soluble N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;stabilized gold nanoparticles (NHC@AuNPs) were synthesized via the bottom&#8208;up approach and showed suitability for applications in catalysis and biomedicine.







Abstract
N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have become attractive ligands for functionalizing gold nanoparticle surfaces with applications ranging from catalysis to biomedicine. Despite their great potential, NHC stabilized gold colloids (NHC@AuNPs) are still scarcely explored and further efforts should be conducted to improve their design and functionalization. Here, the &#8216;bottom&#8208;up&#8217; synthesis of two water&#8208;soluble gold nanoparticles (AuNP&#8208;1 and AuNP&#8208;2) stabilized by hydrophilic mono&#8208; and bidentate NHC ligands is reported together with their characterization by various spectroscopic and analytical methods. The NPs showed key differences likely to be due to the selected NHC ligand systems. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed small quasi&#8208;spherical and faceted NHC@AuNPs of similar particle size (ca. 2.3&#8211;2.6&#8197;nm) and narrow particle size distribution, but the colloids featured different ratios of Au(I)/Au(0) by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Furthermore, the NHC@AuNPs were supported on titania and fully characterized. The new NPs were studied for their catalytic activity towards the reduction of nitrophenol substrates, the reduction of resazurin and for their photothermal efficiency. Initial results on their application in photothermal therapy (PTT) were obtained in human cancer cells in&#8197;vitro. The aforementioned reactions represent important model reactions towards wastewater remediation, bioorthogonal transformations and cancer treatment.

         <title>Enhanced Metal&#8211;Semiconductor Interaction for Photocatalytic Hydrogen&#8208;Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 56, October 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial engineering of photodeposited Au/TiO2 with enhanced metal&#8211;semiconductor interaction and ultrafine Au nanoparticles by a sacrificial carbon&#8208;coating annealing strategy facilitates to transfer photogenerated electrons from TiO2 to nanosized Au to drive photocatalytic hydrogen production.







Abstract
The selective immobilization of noble metals right at the place where photogenerated electrons migrate through the photodeposition approach is a unique strategy to load cocatalysts on semiconductors for solar hydrogen production. However, a poor metal&#8211;semiconductor interaction is often formed, which not only hinders the interfacial charge transfer, but also results in the easy aggregation and shedding of cocatalysts during photocatalytic reactions. Herein, it is demonstrated that the photodeposited ultrafine metals, such as nanosized Au, can be well stabilized on TiO2 nanocrystallines without sintering by employing a sacrificial carbon coating annealing strategy to strengthen the metal&#8208;support interaction. Benefiting from the improved interfacial contact between Au and TiO2 for fast charge transfer and the well&#8208;preserved size&#8208;dependent catalytic behavior of Au nanoparticles toward hydrogen evolution reaction, the annealed Au/TiO2 exhibits a significant enhanced activity toward photocatalytic H2 production with good durability.

         <title>New Synthetic Route to Water&#8208;Soluble Prism[5]arene Hosts and Their Molecular Recognition Properties

Prismarene hosts can be prepared by a direct macrocyclization of functionalized naphthalene monomers. Water soluble prismarene hosts H1 and H3 bind to hydrophobic dications in phosphate buffered saline with Ka values exceeding 109&#8197;M&#8722;1 for G9. H1 and H3 should be considered alongside other high affinity hosts for a variety of chemical and biological applications.







Abstract
We report that the direct macrocyclization of naphthalene monomers bearing ethyl ester functional groups delivers prism[5]arene derivatives, which can be deprotected to yield water&#8208;soluble prism[5]arenes (H1 and H3). 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy showed that dicationic guests bind with the hydrophobic cores buried inside the anisotropic magnetically shielding cavity. Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements showed that H1 and H3 are high&#8208;affinity hosts in PBS&#8208;buffered water with Ka values exceeding 109&#8197;M&#8722;1 for a select guest. The complexation events are driven by the non&#8208;classical hydrophobic effect, CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions, and electrostatic interactions. Host H1 displays somewhat higher affinity toward a common guest than pillar[6]arene bearing carboxylic acid functional groups but is significantly less potent than pillar[6]arene bearing sulfate groups. H1 and H3 should be considered alongside other high affinity hosts for a variety of chemical and biological applications.

         <title>Between Two Chairs: Combination of Theory and Experiment for the Determination of the Conformational Dynamics of Xylosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 56, October 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of experimental and computed data allows to disentangle and quantify complex dynamic conformational mixtures of xylosides. Computed spin&#8208;spin coupling constants bridge the gap between experimental NMR data and the conformer distribution.







Abstract
The conformational properties of monosaccharides constitute fundamental features of oligosaccharides. While the energy landscape of monosaccharides can be altered by a specific biochemical environment or by chemical modifications, the analysis of resulting dynamic conformational equilibria is not feasible by experimental means alone. In this work, a series of &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;xylopyranosides is used to outline how a combination of experimental NMR parameters and computed molecular properties can be used to determine conformers and quantify the composition of conformational equilibria. We demonstrate that identifying the most stable conformers using energy calculations is challenging and computing of NMR shieldings is typically not sensitive enough. On the other hand, computed spin&#8208;spin coupling constants for the xyloside ring can be used to unambiguously assign experimental NMR data of dynamic conformational equilibria and quantify the ratio of different conformers in the mixture. As a proof of principle, this procedure allowed to analyze a hitherto unknown dynamic equilibrium of a diamino&#8208;xyloside as a precursor of a molecular switch.

         <title>Access to Pyridinyl or Pyridinium Aza&#8208;BODIPYs with Tunable Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescence through ICT from 4&#8208;Pyridinyl Pyrroles

         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot protocol for the concise and rapid synthesis of 4&#8208;pyridinyl pyrroles involved in in&#8197;situ generated 2H&#8208;azirine was developed. 1/7&#8208;Pyridinyl and pyridinium NIR Aza&#8208;BODIPYs with/without rigidity were further constructed. These pyridinyl Aza&#8208;BOIDIPYs displayed slight bathochromic shifts and maintained bright NIR emission compared with phenyl analogues. Pyridinium Aza&#8208;BODIPYs showed ICT characteristic effect and may be located in lysosome in cells.







Abstract
Aza&#8208;dipyrromethene boron difluoride (Aza&#8208;BODIPY) dyes have attracted much interest in recent decades. In this manuscript, we provide a facile way to access pyridine&#8208;substituted pyrroles. A series of 1/7&#8208;pyridinyl and pyridinium near&#8208;infrared (NIR) Aza&#8208;BODIPYs with/without rigidity were constructed and their spectroscopic properties were extensively investigated. These pyridinyl Aza&#8208;BOIDIPYs displayed slight bathochromic shifts and maintained bright NIR emission. Pyridinium Aza&#8208;BODIPYs showed increased bathochromic shift, however, the molar extinction coefficients and fluorescence quantum yields were decreased owing to ICT effect. The impacts followed the order of pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ium&gt;pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ium&gt;pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;ium, which was in consistence with their ICT strength. MO calculation was performed to provide possible explanation to the red&#8208;shifted absorption/emission, and apparent charge separation in pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ium Aza&#8208;BODIPYs. The pyridinium Aza&#8208;BODIPY localized in lysosome and potentially avoided harmful &#8216;&#8216;alkalinizing effects&#8217;&#8217; of traditional lysosome&#8208;targeting fluorescent dyes containing amine moiety. We are working on construction of pyridinyl and pyridinium Aza&#8208;BODIPY photosensitizers against microbials or tumors.

The nitroxide TPA (2,2,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;pyrrolin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl&#8208;3&#8208;acetylene) has been protected with a light sensitive 2&#8208;NBOM group and connected to a uridine phosphoramidite building block. Spin&#8208;labeled RNA can be obtained from this compound by standard protocols of oligonucleotide synthesis and used for EPR studies after light&#8208;induced deprotection.







Abstract
The nitroxide TPA (2,2,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;pyrrolin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl&#8208;3&#8208;acetylene) is an excellent spin label for EPR studies of RNA. Previous synthetic methods, however, are complicated and require special equipment. Herein, we describe a uridine derived phosphoramidite with a photocaged TPA unit attached. The light sensitive 2&#8208;nitrobenzyloxymethyl group can be removed in high yield by short irradiation at 365&#8197;nm. Based on this approach, a doubly spin&#8208;labeled 27mer neomycin sensing riboswitch was synthesized and studied by PELDOR. The overall thermal stability of the fold is not much reduced by TPA. In&#8208;line probing nevertheless detected changes in local mobility.

         <title>Understanding the Anion&#8208;Templated, OSDA&#8208;Free, Interzeolite Conversion Synthesis of High Silica Zeolite ZK&#8208;5
</title>

         <dc:description>
High silica forms of the zeolite ZK&#8208;5 are prepared by an interzeolite conversion using inorganic cations and anions as templates. K+ and Cs+ cations and NO3&#8722; anions self&#8208;assemble within its lta and pau cages with a high degree of space filling and exchange with NH4+ followed by heating gives a microporous solid. This approach offers an alternative and organic structure directing agent&#8208;free route to directing zeolite synthesis.







Abstract
High silica zeolite ZK&#8208;5 (framework Si/Al=4.8) has been prepared by interzeolite conversion from ultrastable zeolite Y via a co&#8208;templating route using alkali metal cations and nitrate anions but without organic structure directing agents. The mechanism, which involves zeolite framework &#8211; alkali metal cation &#8211; nitrate anion ordering, has been established by a combination of chemical and thermal analyses, Raman spectroscopy, computational modelling, and X&#8208;ray powder diffraction. Ammonium exchange gives ZK&#8208;5 with occluded ammonium nitrate and subsequent heating gives microporous zeolite ZK&#8208;5.

         <title>Achieving Solution&#8208;Processed Non&#8208;Doped Single&#8208;Emitting&#8208;Layer White Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes through Adjusting Pyrene&#8208;Based Polyaromatic Hydrocarbon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 56, October 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new pyrene&#8208;based polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) molecules&#8208;PyS and PyD were synthesized. Due to the more twisted and extended backbone, the bis&#8208;fused molecule PyD packed in neat Cmca space group in single&#8208;crystal system compared with P21/n for PyS, which may be favorable to form excimers in the solid state and showed solution&#8208;processed non&#8208;doped single&#8208;white&#8208;emitting&#8208;molecule SEL&#8208;WOLED with high performance.







Abstract
Single&#8208;emitting&#8208;layer white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (SEL&#8208;WOLEDs) have developed rapidly in recent years due to the outstanding advantages of high efficiency, simple device structure, low cost, less phase separation, and stable emission color. Nevertheless, the relatively complicated host&#8208;dopant system is usually essential for most previous SEL&#8208;WOLEDs and the development of simple non&#8208;doped SEL&#8208;WOLEDs lags behind. Hence the straightforward synthesis of single&#8208;white&#8208;emitting molecules for non&#8208;doped SEL&#8208;WOLEDs still remains a great challengeable task. In this article, we designed and synthesized two new pyrene&#8208;based polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and used them as emitting layer materials in the OLED devices. When the molecules change from the mono&#8208;fused one to bis&#8208;fused one, the emitting light changes from greenish to white color. Further study indicated that the bis&#8208;fused molecule PyD with more twisted and extended backbone packed in neat Cmca space group in single&#8208;crystal system compared with P21/n for PyS, which may be favorable to form excimers in the solid state and broaden the emission spectrum in the OLEDs. As a result, a solution&#8208;processed non&#8208;doped single&#8208;white&#8208;emitting&#8208;molecule SEL&#8208;WOLED with high performance (e.&#8201;g., a high color rendering index of 66) is reported. The findings will be beneficial not only to further development of simple WOLEDs, but also to other related organic optoelectronic technology.

         <title>Development of an Allenyne&#8208;Alkyne [4+2] Cycloaddition and its Application to Total Synthesis of Selaginpulvilin A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 56, October 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complex character of a strained molecule. the &#945;,3&#8208;dehydrotoluene generated via the [4+2] cycloaddition of allenyne&#8208;alkyne can be trapped with a hydrogen atom donor or nucleophiles with two opposite regioselectivity; oxygen nucleophiles are incorporated at the benzylic position whereas amine nucleophiles are incorporated onto the aromatic core. This unique reactivity and selectivity is exploited for selaginpuvilin synthesis.







Abstract
A new [4+2] cycloaddition of allenyne&#8208;alkyne is developed. The reaction is believed to proceed with forming an &#945;,3&#8208;dehydrotoluene intermediate. This species behaves as a &#963;&#960;&#8208;diradical to react with a hydrogen atom donor, whereas it displays a zwitterionic reactivity toward weak nucleophiles. The efficiency of trapping &#945;,3&#8208;dehydrotoluene depends not only on its substituents but also the trapping agents. Notable features of the reaction are the activating role of the extra alkyne of the 1,3&#8208;diyne that reacts with the allenyne moiety and the opposite mode of trapping with oxygen and nitrogen nucleophiles. Oxygen nucleophiles result in the oxygen&#8208;end incorporation at the benzylic position of the &#945;,3&#8208;dehydrotoluene, whereas with amine nucleophiles the nitrogen&#8208;end is incorporated into the aromatic core. Relying on the allenyne&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition as an enabling strategy, a concise total synthesis of phosphodiesterase&#8208;4 inhibitory selaginpulvilin A is realized.

&#8220;A POM out of the blue&#8221;. Decatungstate anion photocatalyzed a mild dearomatization of indoles to access 2&#8208;acylindolines via direct hydrogen atom transfer under purple&#8208;light irradiation.







Abstract
We report herein a convenient and scalable dearomative hydroacylation reaction of indoles. Employing readily available aldehydes as the acyl source and TBADT as an inexpensive direct HAT photocatalyst, a variety of indoles derivatives were converted into synthetically interesting 2&#8208;acylindolines in good to excellent yields as well as great diastereoselectivity under mild conditions. An asymmetric version of the reaction was successfully developed and an experimental mechanistic investigation was carried out in order to gain further insights on the assumed reaction pathway.

Partial ligand substitution in NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 through solvent&#8208;assisted ligand exchange by BDC enhances the photo&#8208;generated charge separation, which promotes the hydrogen production rate under visible light irradiation.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) constructed by ligands and metal clusters, have been considered as a promising material for photocatalytic water splitting. In this work, a solvent&#8208;assisted ligand exchange (SALE) method has been applied through partial reverse substitution of the ligand in NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 (Ti) by 1,4&#8208;dicarboxybenzene (BDC). This modification strategy can optimize the charge transfer dynamics together with the preserved light absorption, resulting in a 3.3 times higher hydrogen production rate compared to the pristine material under visible&#8208;light irradiation. This work broadens the field of ligand modifications of MOFs to boost the photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Inhibitory Effect of DMSO on Halohydrin Dehalogenase: Experimental and Computational Insights into the Influence of an Organic Co&#8208;solvent on the Structural and Catalytic Properties of a Biocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 56, October 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pros and cons considered: Halohydrin dehalogenases (HHDHs) are versatile enzymes employed in the synthesis of chiral building blocks. To increase substrate solubility, DMSO stands out as the most commonly used co&#8208;solvent. Here we found that DMSO acts as an inhibitor of the enzyme HheC. To understand the observed phenomena at the molecular level, in&#8208;depth experimental studies were performed in combination with molecular dynamics simulations.







Abstract
Although the application of organic solvents in biocatalysis is well explored, in&#8208;depth understanding of the interactions of solvent with proteins, in particular oligomeric ones, is still scant. Understanding these interactions is essential in tailoring enzymes for industrially relevant catalysis in nonaqueous media. In our study, the homotetrameric enzyme halohydrin dehalogenase (HHDH) from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1 (HheC) was investigated, as a model system, in DMSO/water solvent mixtures. DMSO, the most commonly used co&#8208;solvent for biocatalytic transformations, was found to act as a mixed&#8208;type inhibitor with a prevalent competitive contribution. Even 5&#8201;% (v/v) DMSO inhibits the activity of HheC by half. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed that DMSO keeps close to Ser&#8208;Tyr catalytic residues forming alternate H&#8208;bonds with them. Stability measurements paired with differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic light scattering methods and MD studies revealed that HheC maintains its structural integrity with as much as 30&#8201;% (v/v) DMSO.

         <title>Reversible Oxidative Addition of Zinc Hydride at a Gallium(I)&#8208;Centre: Labile Mono&#8208; and Bis(hydridogallyl)zinc Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 56, October 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc dihydride reacts with a gallium(I) reagent by reversible oxidative addition to provide di&#8208; and trimetallic hydridogallyl zinc complexes. The position of oxidative addition&#8208;reductive elimination equilibria can be controlled by coordination/decoordination of TMEDA.







Abstract
In the presence of TMEDA (N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine), partially deaggregated zinc dihydride as hydrocarbon suspensions react with the gallium(I) compound [(BDI)Ga] (I, BDI={HC(C(CH3)N(2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3))2}&#8722;) by formal oxidative addition of a Zn&#8722;H bond to the gallium(I) centre. Dissociation of the labile TMEDA ligand in the resulting complex [(BDI)Ga(H)&#8722;(H)Zn(tmeda)] (1) facilitates insertion of a second equiv. of I into the remaining Zn&#8722;H to form a thermally sensitive trinuclear species [{(BDI)Ga(H)}2Zn] (2). Compound 1 exchanges with polymeric zinc dideuteride [ZnD2]n in the presence of TMEDA, and with compounds I and 2 via sequential and reversible ligand dissociation and gallium(I) insertion. Spectroscopic and computational studies demonstrate the reversibility of oxidative addition of each Zn&#8722;H bond to the gallium(I) centres.

From traditional to sustainable: Catalysts with platinum&#8208;group metals are well&#8208;established in the field of hydroboration of C&#8722;C multiple bonds. However, the current mantra in catalysis is to employ &#8220;cheap metals for noble tasks&#8221;. In this regard, we have developed a bis(phosphino)carbazolido magnesium&#8208;methyl complex as a catalyst for the hydroboration of alkenes, alkynes, and biologically essential terpenes by using pinacolborane (HBpin) as a hydride donor. More information can be found in the Research Article by R.&#8197;G. Gonnade, D. Koley, S.&#8197;S. Sen and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201896).

Abstract
Extension of the medicinal chemistry toolbox is in the vital interest of drug designers. However, the diffusion of an innovation can be a lengthy process. Along these lines, it took almost 70&#8197;years before the use of the sulfoximine group reached a critical mass in medicinal chemistry. Even though interest in this versatile functional group has increased exponentially in recent years, there is ample room for further innovative applications. This Review highlights emerging trends and opportunities for drug designers for the utilization of the sulfoximine group in medicinal chemistry, such as in the construction of complex molecules, proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs) and novel warheads for covalent inhibition.

         <title>A Lewis Acid Stabilized Ketenimine in an Unusual Variant of the Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By the action of a strong Lewis acid, isomerization of the tricyanomethane to the ketenimine, HN=C=C(CN)2, is triggered, which in turn directly attacks an aromatic species in an electrophilic aromatic substitution.







Abstract
Electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) can provide a straightforward approach to the efficient synthesis of functionalized complex aromatic molecules. In general, Lewis acids serve as a beneficial stimulus for the formation of a Wheland complex, the intermediate in the classical SEAr mechanism of EAS, which is responsible for H/E (E=electrophile) substitution under formal H+ elimination. Herein, we report an unusual variant of EAS, in which a complex molecule such as the tricyanomethane, HC(CN)3, is activated with a strong Lewis acid (B(C6F5)3) to the point where it can finally be used in an EAS. However, the Lewis acid here causes the isomerization of the tricyanomethane to the ketenimine, HN=C=C(CN)2, which in turn directly attacks the aromatic species in the EAS, with simultaneous proton migration of the aromatic proton to the imino group, so that no elimination occurs that is otherwise observed in the SEAr mechanism. By this method, it is possible to build up amino&#8208;malononitrile&#8208;substituted aromatic compounds in one step.

         <title>Bismuth Gadolinium Oxychloride with a Remarkable Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Responsive O2 Evolution Activity Promoted by Iodine Doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iodine&#8208;doped Bi2GdO4Cl with a significantly promoted visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive O2&#8208;evolving performance of 154.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum efficiency of &#8764;1.1&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm is reported. The incorporation of I&#8722; ions causes the extended light absorption and promoted charge separation.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive bismuth&#8208;based oxyhalide has recently attracted extensive attention, however, the promotion of its charge separation is still challenging. Herein, we introduce iodine into Bi2GdO4Cl to synthetize I&#8208;doped Bi2GdO4Cl (denoted as yI&#8722;Bi2GdO4Cl, 0&#8804;y&#8804;2). The incorporation of I&#8722; ions is found to enhance light absorption and to accelerate charge separation by combining various characterizations such as density functional theory calculation, photoelectrochemical test, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectrum, and open&#8208;circuit voltage decay. The O2&#8208;evolving performances of 1I&#8722;Bi2GdO4Cl with optimized dopant concentration of I&#8722; ion and IrO2 loaded 1I&#8722;Bi2GdO4Cl are tremendously enhanced by ca. 4 and 45&#8197;times compared to pristine Bi2GdO4Cl. Notably, The O2 evolution rate reaches as high as 154.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 with an apparent quantum efficiency of &#8764;1.1&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm. The synthetic iodine&#8208;doped photocatalyst remains stable after long&#8208;term photoreaction, demonstrating its potential in the field of photocatalysis.

The incorporation of I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions causes the extended light absorption and promoted charge separation.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visible-light-responsive bismuth-based oxyhalide has recently attracted extensive attention, however, the promotion of its charge separation is still challenging. Herein, we introduce iodine into Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;GdO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl to synthetize I-doped Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;GdO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl (denoted as yI&#8722;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;GdO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl, 0&#8804;y&#8804;2). The incorporation of I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions is found to enhance light absorption and to accelerate charge separation by combining various characterizations such as density functional theory calculation, photoelectrochemical test, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectrum, and open-circuit voltage decay. The O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-evolving performances of 1I&#8722;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;GdO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl with optimized dopant concentration of I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ion and IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; loaded 1I&#8722;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;GdO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl are tremendously enhanced by ca. 4 and 45&#8197;times compared to pristine Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;GdO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl. Notably, The O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution rate reaches as high as 154.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with an apparent quantum efficiency of &#8764;1.1&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm. The synthetic iodine-doped photocatalyst remains stable after long-term photoreaction, demonstrating its potential in the field of photocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanistic Investigation of Alkali&#8208;Treated Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction: The Role of OH&#8722; and Metal Cations for Almost 100&#8201;% Selectivity of CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism for alkali&#8208;treated photocatalyst in CO2 photoreduction is studied, especially for demonstrating the role of OH&#8722; and metal cations in detail for highly selective production of CO. DFT calculations confirmed that K ions enhance the charge density of nearby atoms to stabilize CO* groups and reduce the reaction energy barrier, inducing the switch of CH4 to CO.







Abstract
In this work, the modulation of activity and selectivity via photoreduction of carbon dioxide under simulated sunlight was achieved by treating P25 and P25/Pt NPs with KOH. It found that KOH treatment could significantly improve the overall conversion efficiency and switch the selectivity for CO. Photoelectric characterizations and CO2&#8208;TPD demonstrated that the synergistic effect of K+ and OH&#8208; accelerated the separation and migration of photogenerated charges, and also improved CO2 adsorption level. Significantly, the K ions could act as active sites for CO2 adsorption and further activation. In situ FTIR measurements and DFT calculations confirmed that K+ enhanced the charge density of adjacent atoms and stabilize CO* groups, reducing the reaction energy barrier and inducing the switching of original CH4 to CO, which played a selective regulatory role. This study provides insights into the photocatalytic activity and selectivity of alkali&#8208;treated photocatalysts and facilitates the design of efficient and product&#8208;specific photocatalysis.

Abstract
Microbial electro&#8208; and photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction represents an opportunity to tackle the environmental demand for sustainable fuel production. Nanomaterials critically impact the electricity&#8208; and solar&#8208;driven microbial CO2 reduction processes.

Furthermore, the investigation of incorporating non&#8208;photosynthetic microorganisms using advanced light&#8208;harvesting nanostructured photoelectrodes for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion, as well as the current understanding of EET mechanisms occurring at photosynthetic semiconductor nanomaterials&#8208;bacteria biohybrid interface is detailed. The crucial factors influencing the performance of microbial CO2 reduction systems and future perspectives are discussed to provide guidance for the realization of their large&#8208;scale application.

         <title>&#8220;Activated Borane&#8221; &#8211; A Porous Borane Cluster Network as an Effective Adsorbent for Removing Organic Pollutants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous polymer: Thermolysis of nido&#8208;B10H14 and toluene at 250&#8201;&#176;C affords the novel microporous polymer named &#8220;activated borane&#8221;. Analyses suggests an amorphous structure of borane clusters interconnected by toluene moieties. Activated borane displays a high surface area of 774&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, thermal stability under Ar up to 1000&#8201;&#176;C, and sorption capacity to emerging pollutants exceeding the capacity of commercial activated carbon.







Abstract
The unprecedented co&#8208;thermolysis of decaborane(14) (nido&#8208;B10H14) and toluene results in a novel porous material (that we have named &#8220;activated borane&#8221;) containing micropores between 1.0 and 1.5&#8197;nm in diameter and a specific surface area of 774&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 (Ar, 87&#8197;K) that is thermally stable up to 1000&#8201;&#176;C. Solid state 1H, 11B and 13C&#8197;MAS NMR, UV&#8208;vis and IR spectroscopies suggest an amorphous structure of borane clusters interconnected by toluene moieties in a ratio of about three toluene molecules for every borane cluster. In addition, the structure contains Lewis&#8208;acidic tri&#8208;coordinated boron sites giving it some unique properties. Activated borane displays high sorption capacity for pollutants such as sulfamethoxazole, tramadol, diclofenac and bisphenol A that exceed the capacity of commercially&#8208;available activated carbon. The consistency in properties for each batch made, and the ease of its synthesis, make activated borane a promising porous material worthy of broad attention.

         <title>Solvent Effects on Ultrafast Charge Transfer Population: Insights from the Quantum Dynamics of Guanine&#8208;Cytosine in Chloroform</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum Dynamical simulations predict that, following UV irradiation of the Guanine&#8208;Cytosine Watson&#8208;Crick pair in chloroform, 20&#8764;50&#8201;% of the photoexcited population decays to a Gua&#8594;Cyt Charge Transfer state within 100&#8197;fs. Different solvation models were used in an attempt to define the effects modulating this population transfer and to explain why it is less effective than in the gas phase.&#8221;







Abstract
We study the ultrafast photoactivated dynamics of the hydrogen bonded dimer Guanine&#8208;Cytosine in chloroform solution, focusing on the population of the Guanine&#8594;Cytosine charge transfer state (GC&#8208;CT), an important elementary process for the photophysics and photochemistry of nucleic acids. We integrate a quantum dynamics propagation scheme, based on a linear vibronic model parameterized through time dependent density functional theory calculations, with four different solvation models, either implicit or explicit. On average, after 50&#8197;fs, 30&#8764;40&#8201;% of the bright excited state population has been transferred to GC&#8208;CT. This process is thus fast and effective, especially when transferring from the Guanine bright excited states, in line with the available experimental studies. Independent of the adopted solvation model, the population of GC&#8208;CT is however disfavoured in solution with respect to the gas phase. We show that dynamical solvation effects are responsible for this puzzling result and assess the different chemical&#8208;physical effects modulating the population of CT states on the ultrafast time&#8208;scale. We also propose some simple analyses to predict how solvent can affect the population transfer between bright and CT states, showing that the effect of the solute/solvent electrostatic interactions on the energy of the CT state can provide a rather reliable indication of its possible population.

This process is thus fast and effective, especially when transferring from the Guanine bright excited states, in line with the available experimental studies. Independent of the adopted solvation model, the population of GC-CT is however disfavoured in solution with respect to the gas phase. We show that dynamical solvation effects are responsible for this puzzling result and assess the different chemical-physical effects modulating the population of CT states on the ultrafast time-scale. We also propose some simple analyses to predict how solvent can affect the population transfer between bright and CT states, showing that the effect of the solute/solvent electrostatic interactions on the energy of the CT state can provide a rather reliable indication of its possible population.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intermetallic Nanocrystals: Seed&#8208;Mediated Synthesis and Applications in Electrocatalytic Reduction Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermetallic nanocrystals (IMNCs) have attracted extensive attention as electrocatalysis. However, precise control over the size, shape, composition, structure, and exposed crystal facet of IMNCs seems to be a challenge, although these parameters have a significant effect on the electrocatalytic performance. The seed&#8208;mediated synthesis approach is a promising tool for precise control over these parameters of IMNCs.







Abstract
In recent years, intermetallic nanocrystals (IMNCs) have attracted extensive attention in the field of electrocatalysis. However, precise control over the size, shape, composition, structure, and exposed crystal facet of IMNCs seems to be a challenge to the traditional method of high&#8208;temperature annealing although these parameters have a significant effect on the electrocatalytic performance. Controllable synthesis of IMNCs by the wet chemistry method in the liquid phase shows great potential compared with the traditional high&#8208;temperature annealing method. In this Review, we attempt to summarize the preparation of IMNCs by the seed&#8208;mediated synthesis in the liquid phase, as well as their applications in electrocatalytic reduction reactions. Several representative examples are purposely selected for highlighting the huge potential of the seed&#8208;mediated synthesis approach in chemical synthesis. Specifically, we personally perceive the seed&#8208;mediated synthesis approach as a promising tool in the future for precise control over the size, shape, composition, structure, and exposed crystal facet of IMNCs.

         <title>Enantiodivergent Chemoenzymatic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution: Conversion of Racemic Propargyl Alcohols into Both Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Choosing the outcome: A silyl group at the alkyne terminal of secondary propargyl alcohols temporarily inverted the enantio&#8208;recognition of natural lipases. Using this phenomenon, the lipase/oxovanadium co&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of racemic alcohols achieved enantiodivergent production of R and S enantiomers in high yield and with high enantiomeric excess.







Abstract
Natural lipases typically recognize enantiomers of alcohols based on the size differences of substituents near the carbinol moiety and selectively react with the R enantiomers of secondary alcohols. Therefore, lipase&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of racemic secondary alcohols produces only R enantiomers. We report herein a method for obtaining S enantiomers by DKR of secondary 3&#8208;(trialkylsilyl)propargyl alcohols by using a well&#8208;known R&#8208;selective Pseudomonas fluorescens lipase in combination with a racemization catalyst VMPS4, in which the silyl group reverses the size relationship of substituents near the carbinol moiety. We have already reported R&#8208;selective DKR of the corresponding propargyl alcohols without substituents on the ethynyl terminal carbon, and the presence of an easily removable silyl group has enabled us to produce both enantiomers of propargyl alcohols in high chemical yields and with high enantiomeric excess. In addition, immobilization of the lipase on Celite was found to be important for achieving a high efficiency of the DKR.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lead (Pb) halide perovskite nanocrystals, with the general formula APbX3, where A = CH3NH3+, CH(NH2)2+, or Cs+ and X = Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, or I&#8208;, have emerged as a class of materials with promising properties due to their remarkable optical properties and solar cell performance. However, important issues still need to be addressed to enable practical applications of these materials, such as instability, mass production, and Pb toxicity. Recent studies have carried out the replacement of Pb by various less&#8208;toxic cations as Sn, Ge, Sb, and Bi. This variety of chemical compositions provide Pb&#8208;free perovskite and metal halide nanostructures with a wide spectral range, in addition to being considered less toxic, therefore having greater practical applicability. Highlighting the necessity to address and solve the toxicity problems related to Pb&#8208;containing perovskite, this review considers the prospects of the Pb&#8208;free perovskite, involving synthesis methods, and properties of them, including advantages, disadvantages, and applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Bridging Chemical Knowledge and Machine Learning for Performance Prediction of Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recent years have witnessed a boom of machine learning (ML) applications in chemistry, which reveals the potential of data&#8208;driven prediction of synthesis performance. Digitalization and ML modelling are the key strategies to fully exploit the unique potential within the synergistic interplay between experimental data and the robust prediction of performance and selectivity. A series of exciting studies have demonstrated the importance of chemical knowledge implementation in ML, which improves the model&#8217;s capability for making predictions that are challenging and often go beyond the abilities of human beings. This Minireview summarizes the cuttingedge embedding techniques and model designs in syntheses prediction, elaborating how chemical knowledge can be incorporated into machine learning until June 2022. By merging organic synthesis tactics and chemical informatics, we hope that this Minireview can provide a guide map and intrigue chemists to revisit the digitalization and computerization of organic chemistry principles.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis is a by now consolidated organocatalytic platform for a number of synthetic (asymmetric) transformations  via  diverse reaction modes/ intermediates. In addition to the typical  umpolung  processes involving acyl anion/homoenolate equivalent species, implementation of protocols under oxidative conditions greatly expands the possibilities of this methodology. Oxidative NHC&#8208;catalysis allows for oxidative and oxygenative transformations through specific manipulations of Breslow&#8208;type species depending upon the oxidant used (external oxidant or O  2  /air), the derived NHC&#8208;bound intermediates paving the way to non&#8208;  umpolung  processes through activation of carbon atoms and heteroatoms. This review is intended to update the state of the art in oxidative NHC&#8208;catalyzed reactions that appeared in the literature from 2014 to present, with a strong focus to crucial intermediates and their mechanistic implications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An earth&#8208;abundant nickel(II) bipyridine catalyst, combined with lithium hexamethyldisilazide as base, demonstrates its wide applicability in the direct arylation polymerization of di&#8208; and tri&#8208;thiophene heteroaryls with poly(hetero)aryl halides. With a nickel catalyst loading of 2.5 mol%, a series of twenty highly cross&#8208;linked organic polymers are obtained with 34 to 99% yields. Using mixed polytopic coupling partners allows obtaining alternating and optically active thiophene&#8208;based solids with intrinsic porosity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Charge&#8208;transfer excited state (CTES) defines the ability to split photon energy into work producing redox equivalents suitable for photocatalysis. Here, we report inter&#8208;net CTES formation within a two&#8208;fold catenated crystalline metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), constructed with two linkers, N,N&#8242;&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenetetracarboxydiimide (DPNDI) and 2,6&#8208;dicarboxynaphthalene (NDC). The structural flexibility puts two complementary linkers from two nets in a proximal position to interact strongly. Supported by the electrochemical and steady&#8208;state electronic spectroscopic data, this ground&#8208;state interaction facilitates forming CTES that can be populated by direct excitation. We map the dynamics of the CTES which persists over a few nanoseconds and highlight the utilities of such relatively long&#8208;lived CTES as enhanced conductivity of the MOF under light over that measured in dark and as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;principle test, photo&#8208;reduction of methyl viologen under white light.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Mechanism of Substrate Oxidation in Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenases: Insight from Theoretical Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are copper enzymes that today comprise a large enzyme superfamily, grouped into the distinct members AA9&#8211;AA17 (with AA12 exempted). The LMPOs have the potential to facilitate the up&#8208;cycling of biomass waste products by boosting the breakdown of cellulose and other recalcitrant polysaccharides. The cellulose bio&#8208;polymer is the main component of biomass waste and comprises thus a large, unexploited resource. The LMPOs work through a catalytic, oxidative reaction whose mechanism is still controversial. For instance, the nature of the intermediate performing the oxidative reaction is an open question, and the same holds for the employed co&#8208;substrate. We here review theoretical investigations addressing these questions. The applied theoretical methods are usually based on quantum mechanics (QM), often combined with molecular mechanics (QM/MM). We discuss advantages and disadvantages of the employed theoretical methods and comment on the interplay between theoretical and experimental results.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the current greatest challenges in structural biology is to study protein dynamics over a wide range of time scales in complex environments, such as the cell.&#160; Among magnetic resonances suitable for this approach, Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy coupled to Site&#8208;Directed Spin Labeling (SDSL&#8208;EPR) has emerged as a promising tool to study protein local dynamics and conformational ensembles. In this work, we exploit the sensitivity of nitroxide labels in reporting protein local dynamics at room temperature. We demonstrate that such studies can be performed by preserving both the integrity of the cells and the activity of the protein under investigation. Using this approach, we studied the structural dynamics of the chaperone NarJ in its natural host cell,  Escherichia coli  . We established that spin&#8208;labeled NarJ is active inside the cells. We showed that the cellular medium affects NarJ structural dynamics in a site&#8208;specific way, while the structural flexibility of the protein is maintained. Finally, we present and discuss data on the time&#8208;resolved dynamics of NarJ in cellular context.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrostannylation of Red Phosphorus: A Convenient Route to Monophosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Valuable, industrially and academically relevant monophosphorus compounds are accessible directly from red phosphorus by using commonly available reagents. Only modest inert&#8208;atmosphere techniques are needed, making this a convenient and practical methodology for the preparation of P1 compounds from elemental, red phosphorus.







Abstract
The preparation of valuable and industrially relevant organophosphorus compounds currently depends on indirect multistep procedures involving difficult&#8208;to&#8208;handle white phosphorus as a common P atom source. Herein, we report a practical and versatile method for the synthesis of a variety of monophosphorus compounds directly from the bench&#8208;stable allotrope red phosphorus (Pred). The relatively inert Pred was productively functionalised by using the cheap and readily available radical reagent tri&#8208;n&#8208;butyltin hydride, and subsequent treatment with electrophiles yields useful P1 compounds. Remarkably, these transformations require only modest inert&#8208;atmosphere techniques and use only reagents that are inexpensive and commercially available, making this a convenient and practical methodology accessible in most laboratory settings.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preparation of valuable and industrially relevant organophosphorus compounds currently depends on indirect multistep procedures involving difficult-to-handle white phosphorus as a common P atom source. Herein, we report a practical and versatile method for the synthesis of a variety of monophosphorus compounds directly from the bench-stable allotrope red phosphorus (P&lt;sub&gt;red&lt;/sub&gt;). The relatively inert P&lt;sub&gt;red&lt;/sub&gt; was productively functionalised by using the cheap and readily available radical reagent tri-&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-butyltin hydride, and subsequent treatment with electrophiles yields useful P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; compounds. Remarkably, these transformations require only modest inert-atmosphere techniques and use only reagents that are inexpensive and commercially available, making this a convenient and practical methodology accessible in most laboratory settings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Charge transfer in solvent: Guanine is illustrated transferring an electron to cytosine in chloroform after the absorption of light. This is the first step of a deactivation pathway observed previously in experiment, which could also be operative in DNA, that was simulated here by using quantum dynamics. We investigated the role of the solvent, an effect commonly missing in these calculations, and demonstrated that it modulates the conversion from the initially excited &#960;&#960;* states, depicted by two wireframe potential energy surfaces intersecting.

         <title>Enabling Aromatic Hydroxylation in a Cytochrome P450 Monooxygenase Enzyme through Protein Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural and biochemical data demonstrate that 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid binds within the active site of the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP199A4, but no oxidation occurs. Protein engineering and molecular dynamic simulations establish that aromatic oxidation is enabled by a subtle shift of the substrate relative to the heme, thus improving our understanding of this important reaction.







Abstract
The cytochrome P450 (CYP) family of heme monooxygenases catalyse the selective oxidation of C&#8722;H bonds under ambient conditions. The CYP199A4 enzyme from Rhodopseudomonas palustris catalyses aliphatic oxidation of 4&#8208;cyclohexylbenzoic acid but not the aromatic oxidation of 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid, due to the distinct mechanisms of aliphatic and aromatic oxidation. The aromatic substrates 4&#8208;benzyl&#8208;, 4&#8208;phenoxy&#8208; and 4&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;benzoic acid and methoxy&#8208;substituted phenylbenzoic acids were assessed to see if they could achieve an orientation more amenable to aromatic oxidation. CYP199A4 could catalyse the efficient benzylic oxidation of 4&#8208;benzylbenzoic acid. The methoxy&#8208;substituted phenylbenzoic acids were oxidatively demethylated with low activity. However, no aromatic oxidation was observed with any of these substrates. Crystal structures of CYP199A4 with 4&#8208;(3&#8242;&#8208;methoxyphenyl)benzoic acid demonstrated that the substrate binding mode was like that of 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid. 4&#8208;Phenoxy&#8208; and 4&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;benzoic acid bound with the ether or ketone oxygen atom hydrogen&#8208;bonded to the heme aqua ligand. We also investigated whether the substitution of phenylalanine residues in the active site could permit aromatic hydroxylation. Mutagenesis of the F298 residue to a valine did not significantly alter the substrate binding position or enable the aromatic oxidation of 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid; however the F182L mutant was able to catalyse 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid oxidation generating 2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;, 3&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208; and 4&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy metabolites in a 83&#8201;:&#8201;9&#8201;:&#8201;8 ratio, respectively. Molecular dynamics simulations, in which the distance and angle of attack were considered, demonstrated that in the F182L variant, in contrast to the wild&#8208;type enzyme, the phenyl ring of 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid attained a productive geometry for aromatic oxidation to occur.

         <title>Hydrophilic Chitosan Derivatives: Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benign and low&#8208;cost alternative for fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;sourced polymers, chitosan has tremendous potential because of its bioactivity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and low toxicity. Synthetic pathways for chitosan derivatives with improved water solubility, and their associated applications, are explored. With the change in global direction towards a lower carbon economy and reduced environmental impact, fine&#8208;tuning chitosan properties is essential for a better future.







Abstract
Polymer alternatives sourced from nature have attracted increasing attention for applications in medicine, cosmetics, agriculture, food, water purification, and more. Among them, chitosan is the most versatile due to its full biodegradability, exceptional biocompatibility, multipurpose bioactivity, and low toxicity. Although remarkable progress has been made in its synthetic modification by using C3/C6 secondary/primary hydroxy (&#8722;OH) and the C2 amino (&#8722;NH2) active sites, its solubility under physiological conditions remains limited and has hampered larger&#8208;scale adoption. This review summarizes different synthetic methods that increase chitosan&#8216;s hydrophilicity and water solubility by using covalent modifications, namely amino acid addition, quaternary ammonium formation, phosphorylation, and carboxymethylation. We also review several applications for each type of substitution in fields such as cosmetics, medicine, agriculture, and water purification, and provide an outlook and perspective for future modifications and implementations.

         <title>Magnetic Hyperthermia Enhancement in Iron&#8208;based Materials Driven by Carbon Support Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The control of both the thickness of the protective carbon layer, and the size and composition of the nascent confined iron nanoparticles is driven by carbon support interactions. The iron hybrid materials (Fe3C@C/CNFAC) obtained from acid&#8208;treated carbon supports exhibit enhanced specific absorption rate values in biocompatible media.







Abstract
Magnetic hyperthermia (MH) shows great potential in clinical applications because of its very localized action and minimal side effects. Because of their high saturation magnetization values, reduced forms of iron are promising candidates for MH. However, they must be protected in order to overcome their toxicity and instability (i.&#8201;e., oxidation) under biological conditions. In this work, a novel methodology for the protection of iron nanoparticles through confinement within graphitic carbon layers after thermal treatment of preformed nanoparticles supported on carbon is reported. We demonstrate that the size and composition of the nascent confined iron nanoparticles, as well as the thickness of their protective carbon layer can be controlled by selecting the nature of the carbon support. Our findings reveal that a higher nanoparticle&#8211;carbon interaction, mediated by the presence of oxygen&#8208;containing groups, induces the formation of small and well&#8208;protected &#945;&#8208;Fe&#8208;based nanoparticles that exhibit promising results towards MH based on their enhanced specific absorption rate values.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetic hyperthermia (MH) shows great potential in clinical applications because of its very localized action and minimal side effects. Because of their high saturation magnetization values, reduced forms of iron are promising candidates for MH. However, they must be protected in order to overcome their toxicity and instability (i.&#8201;e., oxidation) under biological conditions. In this work, a novel methodology for the protection of iron nanoparticles through confinement within graphitic carbon layers after thermal treatment of preformed nanoparticles supported on carbon is reported. We demonstrate that the size and composition of the nascent confined iron nanoparticles, as well as the thickness of their protective carbon layer can be controlled by selecting the nature of the carbon support. Our findings reveal that a higher nanoparticle&#8211;carbon interaction, mediated by the presence of oxygen-containing groups, induces the formation of small and well-protected &#945;-Fe-based nanoparticles that exhibit promising results towards MH based on their enhanced specific absorption rate values.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>DOTP versus DOTA as Ligands for Lanthanide Cations: Novel Structurally Characterized CeIV and CeIII Cyclen&#8208;Based Complexes and Clusters in Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic chelates sometimes offer peripheral bonding for partially hydrolyzed multivalent cations clusters rather than their tight encapsulation inside the chelate &#8220;cage&#8221;. DOTA and DOTP chelates (1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;(tetrayl)tetraacetic acid) and &#8208;(tetra(methylene phosphonic acid)), respectively) were used to study these chemical and structural motifs with the tetravalent cerium cation in aqueous solutions.







Abstract
The coordination and redox chemistry of aqueous CeIV/III macrocyclic compounds were studied by using the ligands DOTA and DOTP (1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetrayl)tetraacetic acid and 1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetra(methylene phosphonic acid), respectively). The hydrolysis tendency of the tetravalent cation in the presence of DOTA is shown to result in the formation of a highly ordered, fluorite&#8208;like [CeIV6(O)4(OH)4(H2O)8(DOTAH)4] oxo&#8208;hydroxo structure both in solution and in the solid state. The lifetime of the analogous species formed in the presence of DOTP was found to be much shorter. Spectroscopic measurements of the latter suggest its similarity to the former. Its gradual decomposition in solution leads to the accumulation of the in&#8208;cage complexes [CeIVDOTP] and [CeIIIDOTP(H2O)], which were crystallographically characterized in this study. The redox energetics and spectroscopic characteristics for the transition between these two in&#8208;cage complexes in aqueous solutions were studied as well. Together with the crystallographic structures of the above&#8208;mentioned species, the in&#8208;cage [CeIVDOTA(H2O)] complex structure is presented herein for the first time. An elaborative analysis of the X&#8208;ray crystallographic structural data obtained for the in&#8208;cage complexes studied herein and similar structures published previously suggests that hard&#8208;bonding cyclen&#8208;derived ligands are, counter&#8208;intuitively, better suited for encapsulating, and perhaps kinetically stabilize softer cations than harder ones with DOTP, marked as a possible adequate chelator for the study of the aqueous properties of LnII and AcIII cations.

         <title>Chemiluminescent Imaging Assay of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Protein with Target&#8208;Induced Enzyme Activity Regulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemiluminescent imaging assay (CLIA) is designed for sensitive and simple detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) based on a target&#8208;induced enzyme activity regulation (T&#8208;EAR) strategy. The T&#8208;EAR uses a proximity binding&#8208;induced RCA process to produce PPi and a PPi&#8208;mediated enzyme activity regulation process to retain HRP activity for signal generation. This CLIA is wash&#8208;free and can detect SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 NP down to 1&#8197;pg/mL (13&#8197;fM) with only 0.75&#8197;&#956;L of sample.







Abstract
Simple but robust testing assays are essential for screening and diagnosis of individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) in COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Here, we described a chemiluminescent imaging assay (CLIA) for sensitive and convenient detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) by a target&#8208;induced enzyme activity regulation (T&#8208;EAR) strategy. The T&#8208;EAR used a pair of antibody&#8208;DNA probes to recognize SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 NP and proximity&#8208;induce rolling circle amplification for mass&#8208;production of pyrophosphate to coordinate with Cu2+, which prevented the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+ by sodium ascorbate as well as the Cu+&#8208;caused inactivation of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The activity retention of HRP produced strong CL signal for the detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 NP by catalyzing the oxidation of luminol by H2O2. The T&#8208;EAR based CLIA showed a wide detection range from 1&#8197;pg/mL to 100&#8197;ng/mL (13&#8197;fM to 1.3&#8197;nM) with the requirement of only 0.75&#8197;&#956;L of sample. This CLIA had advantages of good sensitivity, simple wash&#8208;free operation, acceptable accuracy, and high&#8208;throughput imaging detection, displaying potential applicability in screening assay of COVID&#8208;19 infection.

         <title>Fabrication of Nb2O5/Carbon Submicrostructures for Advanced Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nb2O5/Carbon (C) submicrostructures are fabricated by using a solvothermal method followed by a calcination process. As lithium ion batterie anodes, the Nb2O5/C submicrostructures exhibit outstanding rate behavior and cyclic performance. The superior electrochemical property is attributed to the distinctive structure for Nb2O5/C submicrostructures, in which Nb2O5 nanoparticles uniformly distributed within Nb2O5/C composite can protect Nb2O5 nanoparticles from agglomeration, and the porous carbon matrix can enhance electron/ion conductivity.







Abstract
Nb2O5 possesses superior fast Li+ storage capability for LIB anodes, benefiting from its fast pseudocapacitive behavior and low volumetric change within the cycling processes. However, the poor electric conductivity for Nb2O5 restricts its reaction kinetics and rate property. Herein, Nb2O5/carbon (C) submicrostructures are fabricated by solvothermal method followed by calcination process. The Nb2O5/C submicrostructures exhibit outstanding rate behavior and cyclic performance (332&#8197;(194)&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;(5)&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). The superior electrochemical property is attributed to the distinctive structure for Nb2O5/C submicrostructures, in which Nb2O5 nanoparticles uniformly distributed within Nb2O5/C composite can protect Nb2O5 nanoparticles from agglomeration, and the porous carbon matrix can enhance electron/ion conductivity. This work furnishes a novel strategy for fabricating Nb2O5/C submicrostructures with superior Li+ storage performance, which can be potentially used to design other metal oxide/C submicrostructures for second battery anode.

         <title>Size Selectivity in Heterolanthanide Molecular Complexes with a Ditopic Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The similar reactivity of lanthanides generally leads to statistically populated polynuclear complexes, making the rational design of ordered hetero&#8208;lanthanide compounds extremely challenging. Here we report on the site selectivity&#160;in hetero&#8208;lanthanide tetranuclear complexes&#160;afforded by the relatively simple ditopic pyterpyNO ligand (4&#8217;&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridil)&#8208;2,2&#8217;:6&#8217;,2&#8221;&#8208;terpyridine  N  &#8208;oxide). The sequential room temperature reaction of RE  2  (tta)  6  (pyterpyNO)  2  (where RE= Y, (  1)  ; Eu, (  2)  , Dy, (  3)  Htta = 2&#8208;thenoyltrifluoroacetone) with La(tta)  3  dme (dme = dimethoxyethane) yielded Y  2  La  2  (tta)  12  (pyterpyNO)  2  (  4  ), Dy  2  La  2  (tta)  12  (pyterpyNO)  2  (  5  ) and Eu  2  La  2  (tta)  12  (pyterpyNO)  2  (  6  ). Single crystals X&#8208;ray diffraction studies showed that  4, 5  and  6  are isostructural, featuring a tetranuclear structure with two different metal coordination sites with coordination numbers 8 (CN8) and 9 (CN9). The two smaller cations are mainly bridged by the  O  &#8208; donor atoms of the NO groups of two pyterpyNO ligands (CN8), while the larger lanthanum centres are bound by a terpyridine unit (CN9). Size selectivity has been studied with structural and magnetic studies in the solid state and through  19  F&#8208;NMR and photoluminescence studies in solution, showing a direct dependence on the difference of ionic radii of the ions and yielding a 91% selectivity for  4  . Furthermore,  19  F&#8208;NMR, X&#8208;ray and PL studies pointed out that the nature of the product is independent from the synthetic route for compound Eu  2  Y  2  (tta)  12  (pyterpyNO)  2  (  7  ), keeping the ion selectivity also for a self&#8208;assembly reaction. Unexpectedly, these studies have evidenced that selectivity is not exclusively governed by electrostatic interactions related to size dimensions.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalyzed Phospha&#8208;Michael Addition: A Highly Efficient Synthesis of Customized Bis(acyl)phosphane Oxide Photoinitiators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The addition of the P&#8208;H bond in bis(mesitoyl)phosphine, HP(COMes)  2  (BAPH), to a wide variety of activated carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds as acceptors was investigated. While this Phospha&#8208;Michael addition does not proceed in the absence of an additive or catalyst, excellent results were obtained with stoichiometric basic potassium or caesium salts. Simple amine bases can be employed in catalytic amounts and especially tetramethylguanidine (TMG) is an outstanding catalyst which allows to prepare bis(acyl)phosphines, R&#8208;P(COMes)  2  , under very mild conditions in excellent yields in short time. All phosphines RP(COMes)  2  can subsequently be oxidized to the corresponding bis(acyl)phosphane oxides, RPO(COMes)  2  , a substance class belonging to the most potent photoinitiators for radical polymerisations known to date. Thereby a simple and highly atom economic method was found, which allows to prepare a broad range of photoinitiators adapted to their specific field of application even on large scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Flow Divergent Lithiation of 2,3&#8208;Dihalopyridines, Deprotolithiation versus Halogen Dance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe herein the first Halogen Dance (HD) in continuous flow on 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;bromopyridine by trapping selectively (pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)lithium species that is known to undergo halogen dance process. In addition, this lithiated intermediate was trapped at lower temperature before the HD occurs. The HD process has been extended to fluoro&#8208;iodopyridines using various electrophiles to afford 25 examples with yields ranging from 42% to 97% with very short residence times. Finally, the scale up of the reaction was demonstrated, affording a promising space&#8208;time yield (STY) of 4.2 kg.h  &#8208;1  .L  &#8208;1  .</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;ligand Co&#8208;assembled 2D Au(I)&#8208;Thiolate Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Au(I)&#8208;thiolate nanosheets with closely&#8208;packed multiple surface functional groups have been synthesized via a one&#8208;pot co&#8208;assembly strategy. The easy but powerful strategy addresses the surface engineering problem for 2D materials and paves the way for their wider applications in sensing and biomaterials.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Au(I)&#8208;thiolate assemblies are a special type of material that can balance high structural stability and rich surface functionality, which shows promising prospects in both fundamental research and applications. Co&#8208;assembly of multiple ligands is a facile way to further enrich the surface properties and functions, and expand their application potentials. In this work, taking 3&#8208;mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), cysteine (Cys) and 1&#8208;thioglycerol (TGO) as example ligands, we studied in detail the possibility to co&#8208;assemble them into one nanosheet. Although the three ligands have significantly different controllability and pathways when self&#8208;assembling individually with Au(I), they can still be effectively co&#8208;assembled by reacting with HAuCl4 together to obtain three&#8208;ligand nanosheets with good colloidal stability. The key points for successful co&#8208;assembly are also revealed by comparing single&#8208; and three&#8208;ligand self&#8208;assembly processes, laying a solid foundation for co&#8208;assembly of even more ligands. The easy but powerful strategy for 2D materials with closely&#8208;packed and multiple tunable surface functional groups addresses the surface engineering problem for 2D materials and paves the way for their wider applications in sensing and biomaterials.

&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional (2D) Au(I)-thiolate assemblies are a special type of material that can balance high structural stability and rich surface functionality, which shows promising prospects in both fundamental research and applications. Co-assembly of multiple ligands is a facile way to further enrich the surface properties and functions, and expand their application potentials. In this work, taking 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), cysteine (Cys) and 1-thioglycerol (TGO) as example ligands, we studied in detail the possibility to co-assemble them into one nanosheet. Although the three ligands have significantly different controllability and pathways when self-assembling individually with Au(I), they can still be effectively co-assembled by reacting with HAuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; together to obtain three-ligand nanosheets with good colloidal stability. The key points for successful co-assembly are also revealed by comparing single- and three-ligand self-assembly processes, laying a solid foundation for co-assembly of even more ligands. The easy but powerful strategy for 2D materials with closely-packed and multiple tunable surface functional groups addresses the surface engineering problem for 2D materials and paves the way for their wider applications in sensing and biomaterials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Chemoselective Catalytic Photooxidations by Using Solvent as a Sacrificial Electron Acceptor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New way to drive photoredox catalysis: Highly chemoselective photooxidations of benzylic alcohols to carbonyl compounds in the presence of various easily&#8208;oxidizable groups are possible in a simple oxygen&#8208;free system consisting of a substrate, unique deazaflavinium catalyst and acetonitrile which acts simultaneously as a sacrificial electron acceptor and solvent.







Abstract
Catalyst recovery is an integral part of photoredox catalysis. It is often solved by adding another component&#8208;a sacrificial agent&#8208;whose role is to convert the catalyst back into its original oxidation state. However, an additive may cause a side reaction thus decreasing the selectivity and overall efficiency. Herein, we present a novel approach towards chemoselective photooxidation reactions based on suitable solvent&#8208;acetonitrile acting simultaneously as an electron acceptor for catalyst recovery, and on anaerobic conditions. This is allowed by the unique properties of the catalyst, 7,8&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenyl&#8208;5&#8208;deazaflavinium chloride existing in both strongly oxidizing and reducing forms, whose strength is increased by excitation with visible light. Usefulness of this system is demonstrated in chemoselective dehydrogenations of 4&#8208;methoxy&#8208; and 4&#8208;chlorobenzyl alcohols to aldehydes without over&#8208;oxidation to benzoic acids achieving yields up to 70&#8201;%. 4&#8208;Substituted 1&#8208;phenylethanols were oxidized to ketones with yields 80&#8211;100&#8201;% and, moreover, with yields 31&#8208;98&#8201;% in the presence of benzylic methyl group, diphenylmethane or thioanisole which are readily oxidized in the presence of oxygen but these were untouched with our system. Mechanistic studies based on UV&#8208;Vis spectro&#8208;electrochemistry, EPR and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy measurements showed that the process involving an electron release from an excited deazaflavin radical to acetonitrile under formation of solvated electron is crucial for the catalyst recovery.

         <title>Highly Efficient Au(I) Alkynyl Emitters: Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence and Solution&#8208;Processed OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new alkynyl Au(I) carbene complex with tunable electronic structure shows high efficiency thermally activated fluorescence (TADF). Solution&#8208;processed OLEDs made with these complexes achieve high external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of up to 20.4&#8201;%, manifesting the bright prospect of Au(I)&#8208;TADF emitters in OLEDs.







Abstract
Two&#8208;coordinate donor&#8208;metal&#8208;acceptor type coinage metal complexes displaying efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) have been unveiled to be highly appealing candidates as emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Herein a series of green to yellow TADF gold(I) complexes with alkynyl ligands has been developed for the first time. The complexes exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of up to 0.76 in doped films (5&#8197;wt&#8201;% in PMMA) at room temperature. The modifications of alkynyl ligands with electron&#8208;donating amino groups together with the use of electron&#8208;deficient carbene ligands induce ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer excited states that give rise to TADF emission. Spectroscopic and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the roles of electron&#8208;donating capability of the alkynyl ligand in tuning the excited&#8208;state properties. Solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) using the present complexes as emitters achieve maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to 20&#8201;%.

         <title>Shedding Light on the Enigmatic TcO2&#8901;x&#8201;H2O Structure with Density Functional Theory and EXAFS Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radioactive Tc in deep nuclear waste repositories can be immobilized by reduction of the highly soluble TcO4&#8722; anion by agents like magnetite (Fe3O4) and H2, which create an amorphous TcO2&#8901;x&#8201;H2O precipitate. EXAFS measurements combined with DFT calculations reveal that the precipitate is an inorganic polymer formed of zigzag TcO2&#8901;2&#8201;H2O chains and give evidence of an increasing polymerization over time. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;F. Oliveira, A.&#8197;C. Scheinost, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202235).

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helicenes and helicene&#8208;like molecules have found a plethora of important applications in many research fields. Consequently, the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of these unique skeletons have drawn a lot of research interests and achieved notable advances in the last two decades. In this review, we comprehensively summarized the progresses in this field, including methods enabled by both asymmetric transition metal catalysis and organocatalysis.







Abstract
Helicenes and helicene&#8208;like molecules, usually containing multiple ortho&#8208;fused aromatic rings, possess unique helical chirality. These compounds have found a wide range of important applications in many research fields, such as asymmetric catalysis, molecular recognition, sensors and responsive switches, circularly polarized luminescence materials and others. However, the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of helicenes was largely underexplored, when compared with the enantioselective synthesis of molecules bearing other stereogenic elements (e.g. central chirality and axial chirality). Since the pioneer work of asymmetric synthesis of helicenes via enantioselective [2+2+2] cycloaddition of triynes by Star&#225; and Star&#253;, last two decades have witnessed the tremendous development in the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of helicenes. In this review, we comprehensively summarized the advances in this field, which include methods enabled by both transition metal catalysis and organocatalysis, and provide our perspective on its future development.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Achiral Carbon Dots in Bi&#8208;Solvent Systems Triggered by Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly in bi&#8208;solvent systems has been demonstrated as an unprecedented strategy to realize circularly polarized luminescence of achiral carbon dots. Dissymmetry factors of 10&#8722;3 are obtained in solution, without the need of any additional element of chirality.







Abstract
An innovative strategy for circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) of carbon dots (CDs) has been developed: The achiral CDs displayed contrary supramolecular chirality and opposite CPL in two different bi&#8208;solvent systems, which are due to the formation of self&#8208;assembled helical nanostructures with two diverse assembly modes (P and M) in aggregate state via intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions and differential hydrogen bonding (H&#8208;bonding) without the need of any additional element of chirality.

Dissymmetry factors of 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; are obtained in solution, without the need of any additional element of chirality.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An innovative strategy for circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) of carbon dots (CDs) has been developed: The achiral CDs displayed contrary supramolecular chirality and opposite CPL in two different bi-solvent systems, which are due to the formation of self-assembled helical nanostructures with two diverse assembly modes (P and M) in aggregate state via intermolecular &#960;-&#960; interactions and differential hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) without the need of any additional element of chirality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Symmetrically &#960;&#8208;Expanded Carbazole Incorporating Fluoranthene Moieties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building big. A symmetrically &#960;&#8208;expanded carbazole incorporating fluoranthene moieties was assembled through a five&#8208;step synthetic route. In comparison to parent N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;substituted carbazole the compound features significantly bathochromically shifted UV&#8208;Vis absorption and emission maxima with considerably increased photoluminescence quantum yield. The &#960;&#8208;expansion results in facilitated oxidation with improved reversibility, while at the same time, the aromaticity of the central carbazole moiety remains unaffected.







Abstract
A novel doubly cyclopentannulated carbazole which is accessible through a successive &#960;&#8208;expansion of di(1&#8208;naphthylamine) is disclosed. The carbazole moiety is generated in the final step through intramolecular oxidative coupling. The &#960;&#8208;expansion of carbazole resulted in strongly altered optoelectronic and electrochemical properties. The solid&#8208;state structure features an interesting packing motif with alternating face&#8208;to&#8208;face &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and edge&#8208;to&#8208;face C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. The experimental findings were corroborated by theoretical calculations.

         <title>Switching Chirophilic Self&#8208;assembly: From meso&#8208;structures to Conglomerates in Liquid and Liquid Crystalline Network Phases of Achiral Polycatenar Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The change of the interhelical self&#8208;assembly from enantiophilic to enantiophobic takes place by reduction of the alkyl chain length and leads to a phase transition from the achiral double gyroid via a tetragonal phase to a chiral triple network phase, associated with a transition from an achiral to a mirror symmetry broken liquid.







Abstract
Spontaneous generation of chirality from achiral molecules is a contemporary research topic with numerous implications for technological applications and for the understanding of the development of homogeneous chirality in biosystems. Herein, a series of azobenzene based rod&#8208;like molecules with an 3,4,5&#8208;trialkylated end and a single n&#8208;alkyl chain involving 5 to 20 aliphatic carbons at the opposite end is reported. Depending on the chain length and temperature these achiral molecules self&#8208;assemble into a series of liquid and liquid crystalline (LC) helical network phases. A chiral isotropic liquid (Iso1[*]) and a cubic triple network phase with chiral I23 lattice were found for the short chain compounds, whereas non&#8208;cubic and achiral cubic phases dominate for the long chain compounds. Among them a mesoscale conglomerate with I23 lattice, a tetragonal phase (Tetbi) containing one chirality synchronized and one non&#8208;synchronized achiral network, an achiral double network meso&#8208;structure with Ia
d space group and an achiral percolated isotropic liquid mesophase (Iso1) were found. This sequence is attributed to an increasing strength of chirality synchronization between the networks, combined with a change of the preferred mode of chirophilic self&#8208;assembly between the networks, switching from enantiophilic to enantiophobic with decreasing chain length and lowering temperature. These nanostructured and mirror symmetry broken LC phases exist over wide temperature ranges which is of interest for potential applications in chiral and photosensitive functional materials derived from achiral compounds.

Low coordination number yet stable: The synthesis and characterisation of new low&#8208;valent palladium (0) complexes are reported, and provide simple access to known and novel complexes, the instrinsic reactivity of which prevented their isolation using existing methods. One complex performs exceptionally well as a catalyst in the hydrosilylation reaction.







Abstract
The synthesis and isolation of [Pd(NHC)(PhC&#8801;CPh)] complexes are reported. These new 14&#8208;electron Pd(0)&#8208;complexes are key synthons leading to known palladium(0) and palladium(II) species, as well as permitting access to unprecedented mixed NHC&#8208;phosphite palladium(0) complexes. This motif permits the facile catalytic hydrosilylation of allenes. DFT calculations have allowed the characterization of the relatively weak interaction between the metal and the diphenylacetylene ligand, with a comparison with a series of ligands with more or less coordinating power, bearing varied structural and electronic properties.

         <title>Merging Rh&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H Functionalization and Cascade Cyclization to Enable Propargylic Alcohols as Three&#8208;Carbon Synthons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reported herein is a reactivity of propargyl alcohols as &#8220;Three&#8208;Carbon Synthons&#8221; in a Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H functionalization of acetanilides, leading to the synthesis of core structures of isocryptolepine, &#947;&#8722;carbolines, dihydrochromeno[2,3&#8208;b]indoles, and diindolylmethanes (DIM) derivatives. The transformation involves a rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H functionalization and heteroannulation to yield indoles followed by a cascade cyclization with both external and internal nucleophiles to afford diverse products. The role of the hydroxy group, the key function of the silver additive, the origin of the reverse regioselectivity and the rate&#8208;determining step, are rationalized in conformity with the combination of experimental, noncovalent interaction analysis and DFT studies. This protocol is endowed with several salient features, including one&#8208;pot multistep cascade approach, exclusive regioselectivity, good functional group tolerance and synthesis of variety of molecular frameworks.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Thiopyrylium&#8208;, Pyrylium&#8208;, and Pyridinium&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks by Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Aldol Condensation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of new vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with special ionic structure and high stability is challenging. Herein, we report a facile, general method for constructing ionic vinylene&#8208;linked thiopyrylium&#8208;based COFs from 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate and other common reagents by means of acid&#8208;catalyzed Aldol condensation. Besides, pyrylium&#8208;, and pyridinium&#8208;based COFs also can be prepared from the same monomer under slightly different reaction conditions. The COFs exhibited uniform nanofibrous morphologies with excellent crystallinities, special ionic structures, well&#8208;defined nanochannels, and high specific surface areas.</dc:description>

         <title>Quest for the Most Aromatic Pathway in Charged Expanded Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the central role of aromaticity in the chemistry of expanded porphyrins, the evaluation of aromaticity remains difficult for these extended macrocycles. The presence of multiple conjugation pathways and different planar and nonplanar&#160;&#960;&#8208;conjugation topologies makes the quantification of global and local aromaticity even more challenging. In neutral expanded porphyrins, it is established the predominance of the aromatic conjugation pathway passing through the imine&#8208;type nitrogens and circumventing the amino NH groups. However, for charged macrocycles, the question about the main conjugation circuit remains open. Accordingly, different conjugation pathways in a set of neutral, anionic, and cationic expanded porphyrins were investigated by means of several aromaticity indices rooted in the structural, magnetic, and electronic criteria. Overall, our results reveal the predominance of the conjugation pathway that passes through all nitrogen atoms in all five&#8208;membered rings to describe the aromaticity of deprotonated expanded porphyrins, while the outer pathway through the perimeter carbon atoms becomes the most aromatic in protonated macrocycles. In nonplanar and charged macrocycles, a discrepancy between electronic and magnetic descriptors is observed. Nevertheless, our work demonstrates AV  min  &#160;remains the best tool to determine the main conjugation pathway of expanded porphyrins.</dc:description>

         <title>Small Molecule Tools to Study Cellular Target Engagement for the Intracellular Allosteric Binding Site of GPCRs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A conserved intracellular allosteric binding site (IABS) has recently been identified at several G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs). Ligands targeting the IABS, so&#8208;called intracellular allosteric antagonists, are highly promising compounds for pharmaceutical intervention and currently evaluated in several clinical trials. Beside co&#8208;crystal structures that laid the foundation for the structure&#8208;based development of intracellular allosteric GPCR antagonists, small molecule tools that enable an unambiguous identification and characterization of intracellular allosteric GPCR ligands are of utmost importance for drug discovery campaigns in this field. Herein, we discuss recent approaches that leverage cellular target engagement studies for the IABS and thus play a critical role in the evaluation of IABS&#8208;targeted ligands as potential therapeutic agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Design concepts for solution and solid&#8208;state emitters &#8211; a modern viewpoint on classical and non&#8208;classical approaches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For a long time, luminescence phenomena were strictly distinguished between the emission of isolated molecules in dilute solutions or close&#8208;packed structures such as in powders or aggregates. This changed with the breakthrough observation of dual&#8208;state efficient materials, which led to a rapid boost of publications examining the influence of structural features to achieve balanced emission with disregarded molecular surroundings. Some first general structural design concepts have already been proposed based on reoccurring patterns and pivotal motifs. However, we have found another way to classify these solution and solid&#8208;state emitters (SSSEs). Hence, this minireview aims to present an overview of published structural features of SSSEs while shining light on design concepts from a more generalized perspective. Since SSSEs are believed to bridge the gap of hitherto known aggregation&#8208;sensitive compound classes, we hope to give future scientists a versatile tool in hand to efficiently design novel luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Protonated Porphyrins: Bifunctional Catalysts for the Metal&#8209;Free Synthesis of N&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;Oxazolidinones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The protonation of commercially available porphyrin ligands yields a class of bifunctional catalysts able to promote the synthesis of N&#8208;alkyl oxazolidinones by the CO2 cycloaddition to corresponding aziridines. The catalytic system does not require the presence of any Lewis base or additive and shows interesting features both in terms of cost&#8208;effectiveness and eco&#8208;compatibility. The metal&#8208;free methodology is active by using the low catalytic loading of 1% mol and the chemical stability of the protonated porphyrin allowed its recycle for three consecutive times without any decrease of performances. In addition, a DFT study was performed in order to suggest how a simple protonated porphyrin can mediate the CO2 cycloaddition to aziridines yielding oxazolidinones.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient hydrogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles catalyzed by NNP&#8208;Manganese(I) pincer complexes at ambient temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manganese&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation reactions have aroused widespread interest in recent years. Among the catalytic systems described, especially PNP&#8208; and NNP&#8208;Mn pincer catalysts have been reported for the hydrogenation of aldehydes, ketones, nitriles, aldimines and esters. Furthermore, NNP&#8208;Mn pincer compounds are efficient catalysts for the hydrogenolysis of less reactive amides, ureas, carbonates, and carbamates. Here, we describe the synthesis and application of specific imidazolylaminophosphine ligands and the corresponding Mn pincer complexes. These new catalysts have been characterized and studied by a combination of experimental and theoretical investigations, and their catalytic activities have been tested in several hydrogenation reactions with good to excellent performance. Especially, the reduction of N&#8208;heterocycles can be performed under very mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Establishing Family Relations in Group 15 Halogenido Metalates with the Largest Molecular Antimony Iodide Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Studying structurally related families of compounds is a valuable tool in understanding and predicting material properties and has been extensively used in metal halide perovskites. Due to their variable anion structures, similar family relations are still largely missing in group 15 halogenido metalates. Herein, we present compounds featuring the [Sb2 n I6 n +4]4&#8722;&#8208;family of anions, including the first n = 5 member in [Hpyz]4[Sb10I34] (Hpyz = pyrazinium), which contains the largest halogenido pentelate anion reported to date. The optical properties of compounds featuring n = 1 &#8211; 5 anions show a clear trend as well as an outlier, a low band gap of 1.72 eV for [Hpyz]4[Sb10I34], that can be well understood using quantum chemical investigations. Also using SbI3 and [H2NMe2]3[SbI6], a compound featuring a single octahedral [SbI6]3&#8208; unit as limiting cases, we show that structure&#8208;property relationships can be established in group 15 halogenido metalates in a similar way as in metal halide perovskites, providing a framework for understanding new and literature&#8208;known compounds in this emerging class of materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolation and Reactivity of Stannylenoids Stabilized by Amido/Imino Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction&#160;of the lithium aryl(silyl)amide Dipp(iPr3Si)NLi (Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) with one equivalent of SnCl2&#160;in THF gave a novel stannylenoid Dipp(iPr3Si)NSnCl&#8729;LiCl(THF)2. Heating up the solution of the amidostannylenoid in toluene at 80&#160;oC resulted in the dimeric amido(chloro)stannylene [Dipp(iPr3Si)NSnCl]2, which can be converted to the bis(amido)stannylene Sn[N(Dipp)(iPr3Si)]2&#160;and amido(imino)stannylene Sn[N(Dipp)(iPr3Si)][IPrN] (IPrN = bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;imino). Treatment of bis(imino)stannylenoid [IPrN]2Sn(Cl)Li with N2O resulted in the dimeric complex [IPrNSn(Cl)OLi]2. All compounds were characterized by NMR, elementary analysis, and X&#8208;ray structural determination.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterization of the glmS ribozymes from Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium difficile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The  glmS  ribozyme regulates the expression of the essential GlmS enzyme being involved in cell wall biosynthesis. While &gt; 450 variants of the  glmS  ribozyme were identified by  in silico  approaches and homology searches, only a few have yet been experimentally investigated. Herein, we validate and characterize the  glmS  ribozymes of the human pathogens  Clostridium difficile  and  Listeria monocytogenes  . Both ribozymes, as their previous characterized homologs rely on glucosamine&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate as co&#8208;factor and the presence of divalent cations for exerting the cleavage reaction. The observed EC  50  values in turn were found to be in the submicromolar range, at least an order of magnitude lower than observed for  glmS  ribozymes from other bacteria. The  glmS  ribozyme of  L. monocytogenes  was further shown to bear unique properties. It discriminates between co&#8208;factors very stringently and other than the  glmS  ribozyme of  C. difficile  retains activity at low temperatures. This finding illustrates that albeit being highly conserved,  glmS  ribozymes have unique characteristics.</dc:description>

         <title>Endoperoxides Compounds for Highly Efficient Cancer Treatment under Hypoxia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) for cancer treatment has garnered great attention, with promising non&#8208;invasiveness, low side effects, and spatiotemporal selectivity. However, the hypoxic microenvironment in solid tumours remains a serious resistant factor to limit PDT effects.  Endoperoxides  are always utilized as chemical storage or supplier of singlet oxygen  (  1  O  2  ), the active substance for PDT in materials and other domains. Recent reports indicated that this type of compounds could remarkably enhance the therapeutic effects of PDT under hypoxia. This concept mainly introduces a few representative endoperoxides and outlook of their potent application for the treatment of hypoxic cancer cells.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO  2  (CO  2  &#8208;ODP) is a promising technique for realizing high&#8208;yield propylene production and CO  2  usage. Developing a highly efficient catalyst for CO  2  &#8208;ODP is essential and beneficial to the chemical industry and for realizing net&#8208;zero emissions. Many studies have investigated metal oxide&#8208;based catalysts, revealing that rapid deactivation and low selectivity remain limiting factors for their industrial applications. In recent years, metallic nanoparticle catalysts have become increasingly attractive due to their unique properties. Therefore, we summarize the performance of metal&#8208;based catalysts in CO  2  &#8208;ODP reactions by considering catalyst design concepts, different mechanisms in the reaction process, and the role of CO  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>A Reversibly Porous Supramolecular Peptide Framework
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability to use bio&#8208;inspired building&#8208;blocks in the assembly of novel supramolecular frameworks is at the forefront of an exciting research field. Herein, we present the first polyproline helix to self&#8208;assemble into a reversibly porous, crystalline, supramolecular peptide framework (SPF). Thermal activation, guest&#8208;induced dynamic porosity and enantioselective guest inclusion have been demonstrated for this novel system.







Abstract
The ability to use bio&#8208;inspired building blocks in the assembly of novel supramolecular frameworks is at the forefront of an exciting research field. Herein, we present the first polyproline helix to self&#8208;assemble into a reversibly porous, crystalline, supramolecular peptide framework (SPF). This framework is assembled from a short oligoproline, adopting the polyproline II conformation, driven by hydrogen&#8208;bonding and dispersion interactions. Thermal activation, guest&#8208;induced dynamic porosity and enantioselective guest inclusion have been demonstrated for this novel system. The principles of the self&#8208;assembly associated with this SPF will be used as a blueprint allowing for the further development of helical peptide linkers in the rational design of SPFs and metal&#8208;peptide frameworks.

         <title>Chemical Strategies for Dendritic Magneto&#8208;plasmonic Nanostructures Applied to Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards ultrasensitive SERS analysis: Magneto&#8208;plasmonic dendrimer&#8208;based colloids have been explored for the adsorption and SERS detection of contaminants in water quality monitoring assisted by magnetic separation. Three chemical routes &#8211; crosslinking, chemical grafting, and layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly &#8211; led to hybrid nanostructures with distinct potentialities.







Abstract
Chemical analyses in the field using surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) protocols are expected to be part of several analytical procedures applied to water quality monitoring. To date, these endeavors have been supported by developments in SERS substrate nanofabrication, instrumentation portability, and the internet of things. Here, we report distinct chemical strategies for preparing magneto&#8208;plasmonic (Fe3O4&#8201;:&#8201;Au) colloids, which are relevant in the context of trace&#8208;level detection of water contaminants due to their inherent multifunctionality. The main objective of this research is to investigate the role of poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (PAMAMs) in the preparation of SERS substrates integrating both functionalities into single nanostructures. Three chemical routes were investigated to design magneto&#8208;plasmonic nanostructures that translate into different ways for assessing SERS detection by using distinct interfaces. Hence, a series of magneto&#8208;plasmonic colloids have been characterized and then assessed for their SERS activity by using a model pesticide (thiram) dissolved in aqueous samples.

         <title>Calcium Carbonate Dissolution from the Laboratory to the Ocean: Kinetics and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbonate chemistry: Although calcite dissolution has been extensively studied there appears to be a problem; apparent contradictions, discrepancies between laboratories and inconsistencies with field measurements seemingly pervade the literature. This review highlights how &#8211; in some circumstances &#8211; a lack of appreciation of the role of mass&#8208;transport may have hindered development.







Abstract
The ultimate fate, over the course of millennia, of nearly all of the carbon dioxide formed by humankind is for it to react with calcium carbonate in the world's oceans. Although, this reaction is of global relevance, aspects of the calcite dissolution reaction remain poorly described with apparent contradictions present throughout the expansive literature. In this perspective we aim to evidence how a lack of appreciation of the role of mass&#8208;transport may have hampered developments in this area. These insights have important implications for both idealised experiments performed under laboratory conditions and for the measurement and modelling of oceanic calcite sediment dissolution.

         <title>Harnessing Water to Enhance Quadrupolar NMR Spectroscopy and Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
17O and 14N are attractive targets for in&#8197;vivo NMR spectroscopy and imaging, but low gyromagnetic ratios and fast spin relaxation complicate their observations. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201490), R.&#8197;P. Martinho and L. Frydman explore indirect ways for detecting these sites with the help of proton detection, amplified by chemical exchanges with the abundant water 1H signal. These amplifications are mediated by spontaneous exchanges that the labile 1Hs bound to 17O or 14N undergo with the water protons, opening new avenues in spectroscopic MRI.

         <title>Water&#8208;Mediated Epoxy/Surface Adhesion: Understanding the Interphase Region</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epoxy resin coatings are commonly used to protect metal surfaces from corrosion. Molecular simulations are used to investigate the adhesion in an epoxy resin precursor to hematite and goethite surfaces, as a proxy for steel surfaces and the effect of water ingress. For hematite water always decreases the adhesion whilst for goethite a small amount of water increases adhesion to the surface.







Abstract
Epoxy resins coatings are commonly found in corrosion protection coatings but the presence of water can affect their adhesion to the substrate, often weakening the adhesion of the coating to the solid, reducing its efficiency. Nevertheless, small amounts of water can enhance the epoxy/substrate interactions. In this work, the interphase region of an epoxy precursor and metal oxide substrates is investigated using molecular simulations and it is found that water accumulates between the epoxy layer and the solid substrate. At high water concentrations (9&#8197;wt&#8201;%) the interaction between the epoxy precursor and the solid surface is weakened regardless of the nature of the solid, but at low water concentrations the nature of the solid surface becomes important. For hematite, the presence of water decreases the strength of adhesion but for goethite the presence of a small amount of water (3&#8197;wt&#8201;%) enhances the adhesion to the surface resulting in a densification at the interface.

         <title>Templated Generation of a Bcl&#8208;xL Inhibitor by Isomer&#8208;Free SPAAC Based on Azacyclonon&#8208;5&#8208;yne</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Less strain, more gain. We present Fmoc&#8208;ACN as the first cyclononyne suitable for isomer&#8208;free strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (iSPAAC). We demonstrate its use for the rational design and protein&#8208;templated formation of a low&#8208;micromolar inhibitor of protein&#8211;protein interactions mediated by Bcl&#8208;xL. The lower intrinsic reactivity of cyclononynes as compared to cyclooctynes facilitated higher template effects and rate accelerations in the aqueous environment.







Abstract
High&#8208;affinity inhibitors of large protein&#8211;protein interactions often have a high molecular weight, which compromises their cell permeability and oral bioavailability. We recently presented isomer&#8208;free, strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (iSPAAC) as a method by which to generate large, chemically uniform bioactive molecules inside living cells from two smaller components with higher cell permeability. Here, we present the synthesis of Fmoc&#8208;protected azacyclonon&#8208;5&#8208;yne (Fmoc&#8208;ACN) as the first cyclononyne suitable for iSPAAC. ACN facilitated the structure&#8208;guided development of a single&#8208;digit micromolar triazole inhibitor of the protein&#8211;protein interaction domain of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl&#8208;xL. Inhibitor formation in aqueous buffer at 37&#8201;&#176;C, templated by the target protein Bcl&#8208;xL, proceeded 2800 times faster than the reaction between Fmoc&#8208;ACN and benzyl azide under standard conditions in acetonitrile. Our data demonstrate the utility of cyclononynes for iSPAAC and their potential for achieving vastly accelerated templated reactions in aqueous environments.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Less strain, more gain&lt;/b&gt;. We present Fmoc-ACN as the first cyclononyne suitable for isomer-free strain-promoted azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (iSPAAC). We demonstrate its use for the rational design and protein-templated formation of a low-micromolar inhibitor of protein&#8211;protein interactions mediated by Bcl-x&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. The lower intrinsic reactivity of cyclononynes as compared to cyclooctynes facilitated higher template effects and rate accelerations in the aqueous environment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-affinity inhibitors of large protein&#8211;protein interactions often have a high molecular weight, which compromises their cell permeability and oral bioavailability. We recently presented isomer-free, strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (iSPAAC) as a method by which to generate large, chemically uniform bioactive molecules inside living cells from two smaller components with higher cell permeability. Here, we present the synthesis of Fmoc-protected azacyclonon-5-yne (Fmoc-ACN) as the first cyclononyne suitable for iSPAAC. ACN facilitated the structure-guided development of a single-digit micromolar triazole inhibitor of the protein&#8211;protein interaction domain of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-x&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. Inhibitor formation in aqueous buffer at 37&#8201;&#176;C, templated by the target protein Bcl-x&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, proceeded 2800 times faster than the reaction between Fmoc-ACN and benzyl azide under standard conditions in acetonitrile. Our data demonstrate the utility of cyclononynes for iSPAAC and their potential for achieving vastly accelerated templated reactions in aqueous environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Tailoring To Construct Ultrathin Bi2O2O/Bi2O2(OH)(NO3) Nanosheets: Interactive CO2RR Promotion and Bismuth&#8208;Oxygen Moiety Preservation</title>

         <dc:description>
Special morphology: Ultrathin Bi2O2O surface/Bi2O2(OH)(NO3) substrate nanosheets were prepared through in&#8208;situ interlamellar hydrogen&#8208;bond tailoring strategies. The special morphology not only helps to facilitate production of the Bi2O2CO3 intermediate, but also enhances the resistance of Bi&#8722;O moieties to being reduced to promote formate production from CO2RR.







Abstract
Bismuth&#8211;oxygen moieties are beneficial for high&#8208;efficiency electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) to produce formate; however, preserving bismuth&#8208;oxygen moieties while applying a cathodic potential is challenging. This work reports the preparation of ultrathin Bi2O2O/Bi2O2(OH)(NO3) nanosheets (BiON&#8208;uts) by in&#8208;situ tailoring of hydrogen bonds in a Bi2O2(OH)(NO3) precursor. The BiON&#8208;uts exhibits a formate faradaic efficiency of 98&#8201;% with higher partial current density than that of most reported bismuth&#8208;based catalysts. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the ultrathin nanosheet morphology facilitates ion&#8208;exchange between BiON&#8208;uts and the electrolyte to produce Bi2O2CO3 as intermediate, and adsorption of CO2 with surface Bi2O2O. DFT calculations reveal that the rate&#8208;limiting first electron transfer is effectively improved by the high electron affinity of Bi2O2CO3. More importantly, high&#8208;efficiency CO2RR in turn protects the bismuth&#8211;oxygen moieties from being reduced and thus helps to maintain the excellent CO2RR activity. This work offers an interactive mechanism of CO2RR promotion and bismuth&#8211;oxygen moiety preservation, opening up new opportunities for developing high&#8208;performance catalysts.

         <title>Solution Structure of a Lanthanide&#8208;binding DNA Aptamer Determined Using High Quality pseudocontact shift restraints</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;range paramagnetic NMR restraints remain largely inaccessible for nucleic acid systems. In this contribution we demonstrate that such restraints can be generated by a lanthanide ion bound to an intrinsic site provided by a DNA aptamer. By solving the 3D structure of the aptamer&#8208;Ln3+ complex we provide the structural basis for the introduction of similar sites into other DNA systems.







Abstract
In this contribution we report the high&#8208;resolution NMR structure of a recently identified lanthanide&#8208;binding aptamer (LnA). We demonstrate that the rigid lanthanide binding by LnA allows for the measurement of anisotropic paramagnetic NMR restraints which to date remain largely inaccessible for nucleic acids. One type of such restraints &#8208; pseudocontact shifts (PCS) induced by four different paramagnetic lanthanides &#8208; was extensively used throughout the current structure determination study and the measured PCS turned out to be exceptionally well reproduced by the final aptamer structure. This finding opens the perspective for a broader application of paramagnetic effects in NMR studies of nucleic acids through the transplantation of the binding site found in LnA into other DNA/RNA systems.

         <title>Revealing the Effect of Surface Composition on Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes Supported Pt&#8208;Fe Alloy Electrocatalysts for Methanol Oxidation Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Electrocatalytic methanol oxidation: This work have been successfully fabricated property Pt&#8722;Fe alloy supported on the MWCNTs featuring nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon via co&#8208;engineering of the surface composition and electronic structure. The resulting structure is a highly active methanol oxidation catalyst.







Abstract
The designs of efficient and inexpensive Pt&#8208;based catalysts for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) are essential to boost the commercialization of direct methanol fuel cells. Here, the highly catalytic performance PtFe alloys supported on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) decorating nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NC) have been successfully prepared via co&#8208;engineering of the surface composition and electronic structure. The Pt1Fe3@NC/MWCNTs catalyst with moderate Fe3+ feeding content (0.86&#8197;mA/mgPt) exhibits 2.26&#8208;fold enhancement in MOR mass activity compared to pristine Pt/C catalyst (0.38&#8197;mA/mgPt). Furthermore, the CO oxidation initial potential of Pt1Fe3@NC/MWCNTs catalyst is lower relative to Pt/C catalyst (0.71&#8197;V and 0.80&#8197;V). Benefited from the optimal surface compositions, the anti&#8208;corrosion ability of MWCNT, strong electron interaction between PtFe alloys and MWCNTs and the N&#8208;doped carbon (NC) layer, the Pt1Fe3@NC/MWCNTs catalyst presents an improved MOR performance and anti&#8208;CO poisoning ability. This study would open up new perspective for designing efficient electrocatalysts for the DMFCs field.

Here we demonstrate the utility of high and ultra&#8208;high field 1H&#8208;detected fast MAS ssNMR spectroscopy, which exhibits increased sensitivity and spectral resolution to further elucidate the atomic&#8208;level composition and structural arrangement of the cell wall of Schizophyllum commune, a mushroom&#8208;forming fungus from the Basidiomycota phylum. These advancements allowed us to reveal that Cu(II) ions and the antifungal peptide Cathelicidin&#8208;2 mainly bind to cell wall proteins at low concentrations while glucans are targeted at high metal ion concentrations. In addition, our data suggest the presence of polysaccharides containing N&#8208;acetyl galactosamine (GalNA) and hydrophobin proteins. including SC3, sheding more light on the molecular make&#8208;up of cell wall as well as the positioning of the polypeptide layer. Obtaining such information may be of critical relevance for future research into fungi in material science and biomedical contexts.</dc:description>

         <title>Cluster&#8208;based crystalline materials for iodine capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The treatment of radioactive iodine in nuclear waste has always been a critical issue of social concern. The rational design of targeted and efficient capture materials is of great significance to the sustainable development of the ecological environment. In recent decades, crystalline materials have served as a molecular platform to study the binding process and capture mechanism of iodine molecules, enabling people to understand the interaction between radioactive iodine guests and pores intuitively.  Cluster&#8208;based  crystalline materials, including molecular clusters and cluster&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks, are emerging candidates for iodine capture due to their aggregative binding sites, precise structural information, tunable pores/packing patterns, and abundant modifications.  Herein, this paper reviews the recent progress of  different types of cluster materials and cluster&#8208;dominated metal&#8208;organic porous materials for iodine capture. The research prospects, design strategies to improve the affinity for iodine and possible capture mechanisms are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Introduction of Ferrocene as a Facilitator for the Construction of Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proper monomer design is the key to enhancing the strength of noncovalent interactions between the molecules toward the efficient formation of supramolecular polymers (SPs). We have designed and synthesized 1,n&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted ferrocene&#8211;azobenzene&#8211;long alkyl chains, Fc(CONH&#8208;Azo&#8208;TDP)2  , to afford SP with a high probability. The design exploits the &#8216;&#8216;molecular ball&#8208;bearing&#8217;&#8217; property of the ferrocene core, which allows two azobenzene arms to rotate in the planes of cyclopentadienyl rings, generating the most suitable molecular conformation required for SP formation. This ferrocene&#8208; monomer formed a supergel consisting of SPs supported by strong inter&#8208;molecular (H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking) interactions and higher enthalpy gain than the reference molecules, where the central ferrocene core was replaced by flexible aliphatic as well as rigid benzene linkers. The molecular conformation involved in SP, the strength of noncovalent interactions, and the process of supramolecular polymerization were investigated through NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, XRD and TEM studies. The results demonstrate that ferrocene may act as a good modulator for constructing efficient SP.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolation of Homo/Mixed Valence Ag12, Ag29, and Ag8 Clusters Stabilized by Cyclic Alkyl(amino) Carbene&#8208;Anchored Monoanionic Phosphorus Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silver (Ag) clusters are attractive candidates for their promising optical properties and biomedical activities. Herein, we report on the first syntheses, and isolation of the three mixed valence silver NCs with Ag  12  Cl  3  , Ag  29  , and Ag  8  cores [((cAAC)P)  6  Ag  12  Cl  3  ](OTf)  3  (  1  ), [((cAAC)P)  6  Ag  29  ] (  2  ), and &#160;[((cAAC)P)  4  Ag  8  ] (  3  ) having three/two&#8208;fold symmetry, employing cyclic alkyl(amino) carbene (cAAC)&#8208;supported phosphinidenides (cAACP  &#8722;  ) as the &#960;&#8208;accepting stabilizing ligand. The average diameters of the two Ag NC (  1  ,  2  ) are approximately of 1.6 to 2 nm. The redox non&#8208;innocent mono&#8208;atomic phosphorus anions (P  &#8722;  ) anchored with cAAC ligands are  in situ  generated by the reaction of AgOTf with a boryl&#8208;phosphaalkene (cAAC)P  &#8208;  B(N  i  Pr  2  )  2  via the cleavage of the P&#8722;B bond with the help of triflate anion (OTf  &#8722;  ) as a weak nucleophile. The equivalent numbers of the  in situ  generated (cAAC)P  &#8722;  anions are oxidized to produce the corresponding bis&#8208;phosphinidene (cAAC)  2  P  2  , leading to the generation of Ag(0) ions in solution for the formation of the unprecedented mixed valence Ag NC  2  . Complex  3  is achieved by the reaction of potassium phosphinidenide cAACPK with AgNTf  2  .The ligand field, and the steric hindrance of the (cAAC)P units play a crucial role for stabilization of the complexes  1  &#8208;  2  , further providing a three&#8208;fold stand. The Ag  12  Cl  3  NC  1  with tri&#8208;cationic core [Ag(I)  12  Cl  3  ] is found to be diamagnetic, and fluorescent, emitting green light at 563 nm when excited at 400 nm. Whereas, the neutral Ag  29  (  2  ), and Ag  8  (  3  ) clusters are found to be paramagnetic, and NMR silent showing characteristic EPR signals for Ag(0) at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Double Carbonylation of Nitroarenes with Aryl Halides Using Mo(CO)6 as a Reductant and Carbonyl Source</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel palladium&#8208;catalyzed reductive double carbonylation of nitroarenes with aryl halides for the synthesis of benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones has been reported. The key to success was the use of Mo(CO)  6  as a reductant and bench&#8208;stable solid carbonyl sources.&#160;Various aryl iodides, bromides, and trifluoromethanesulfonates are suitable reaction partners and produce corresponding benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives in moderate to good yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that nitrosoarene was first generated as the key intermediate through nitro reduction. Remarkably, this method avoids the use of toxic CO gas and is further applied to the late&#8208;stage modification of estrone.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The co&#8208;crystallization of tetracyanobenzene (TCB) with haloarenes ArX provided six new co&#8208;crystals TCB&#8226;ArX (ArX = PhCl, PhBr, 4&#8208;MeC  6  H  4  Cl, 4&#8208;MeC  6  H  4  Br, 4&#8208;MeOC  6  H  4  Cl, 1,2&#8208;Br  2  C  6  H  4  ) which were studied by X&#8208;ray diffraction. In these systems, the strong collective effect of &#960;&#8943;&#960; stacking interactions and lone pair&#8208;(X)&#8943;&#960;&#8208;hole&#8208;(C) bondings between TCB and ArX promote the strength of X&#8943;N  cyano  halogen bonding (HaB). Theoretical studies showed that the stacking interactions affect the &#963;&#8208;hole depth of the haloarenes, thus significantly boosting their ability to function as HaB donors. According to the molecular electrostatic potential calculations, the &#963;&#8208; hole&#8208;(Cl) value (1.5 kcal/mol) in the haloarene 4&#8208;MeOC  6  H  4  Cl (featuring an electron&#8208;rich arene moiety and exhibiting very poor &#963;&#8208;hole&#8208;(Cl) ability) increases significantly in the stacked trimer (TCB)  2  &#8226;4&#8208;MeOC  6  H  4  Cl (12.5 kcal/mol). Theoretical DFT calculations demonstrate the dramatic increase of X&#8943;N  cyano  HaB strength for stacked trimers in comparison with parent unstacked haloarenes.</dc:description>

Nucleoside  1  is a weak stabilizer of dA&#8208;dT base pairs, nucleoside  2  evokes strong stabilization. Strand displacement reactions used single&#8208;stranded invaders with single and multiple incorporations of stabilizers. Displacement is driven by negative enthalpy changes between target and displaced duplex. Toeholds are not required. Two new environmental sensitive fluorescent pyrene sensors were developed to monitor the progress of displacement reactions. Pyrene was connected to the nucleobase in the invader or to a dendritic linker in the output strand. Both new sensors were constructed by click chemistry; phosphoramidites and oligonucleotides were prepared. Sensors show monomer or excimer emission. Fluorescence intensity changes when the displacement reaction progresses. Our work demonstrates, that strand displacement with base pair stabilizers is applicable to DNA, RNA and to related biopolymers with applications in chemical biology, nanotechnology and medicinal diagnostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiply Twisted Chiral Macrocycles Clamped by Tethered Binaphthyls Exhibiting High Circularly Polarized Luminescence Brightness</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral macrocycles with multiple twisted structures have been synthesized as emissive chiroptical dyes by anchoring tethered chiral binaphthyls. The rigid molecular structure exhibits a high gCPL and quantum yield, leading to a high CPL brightness (BCPL).







Abstract
Chiral macrocyclic dimers, trimers, and tetramers composed of paraphenylene and tethered binaphthyl were synthesized, and their molecular structures and chiroptical properties were investigated. X&#8208;ray analysis and theoretical calculations revealed that multiple twisted molecular structures &#8211; dimers, trimers, and tetramers &#8211; adopt figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight, M&#246;bius triangle, and concave rectangle structures, respectively. These homologues have large &#1013; values in their UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra because of the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the naphthalene&#8208;phenylene&#8208;naphthalene frameworks. Owing to the shape&#8208;persistent ring structure and tethering with &#8722;OCH2CH2O&#8722;, high fluorescence quantum yields and a relatively high dissymmetry factor gCPL in circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra were achieved. This results in CPL brightness (BCPL) of over 100, which is greater than that of the conventional organic CPL dye.

         <title>Dynamic Timing Control of Molecular Photoluminescent Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time is more! A review of how molecular emissive properties can be controlled in a dynamic time&#8208;dependent manner to give compounds that show great potential for designing smart luminescent materials with time&#8208;encoding features.







Abstract
Dynamic control of molecular photoluminescence offers chemical solutions to designing functional emissive materials. Although stimuli&#8208;switchable molecular luminescent systems are well established, how to encode these dynamic emissive systems with a &#8220;timing&#8221; feature, that is, time&#8208;dependent luminescent properties, remains challenging. This Concept aims to summarize the design principles of dynamic timing molecular photoluminescent systems by discussing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of this topic and the shaping of fabrication strategies at both the molecular and supramolecular levels. An outlook and perspectives are given to outline the future opportunities and challenges in the rational design and potential applications of these smart emissive systems.

         <title>Intracellular Assembly of Interacting Enzymes Yields Highly&#8208;Active Nanoparticles for Flow Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;enzyme hydrogel nanoparticles of controlled arrangements of interacting enzymes can be produced intracellularly, purified from crude bacterial lysates in a one&#8208;step process, and used as stable materials in flow&#8208;through biocatalysis.







Abstract
All&#8208;enzyme hydrogel (AEH) particles with a hydrodynamic diameter of up to 120&#8197;nm were produced intracellularly with an Escherichia coli&#8208;based in&#8197;vivo system. The inCell&#8208;AEH nanoparticles were generated from polycistronic vectors enabling simultaneous expression of two interacting enzymes, the Lactobacillus brevis alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and the Bacillus subtilis glucose&#8208;1&#8208;dehydrogenase (GDH), fused with a SpyCatcher or SpyTag, respectively. Formation of inCell&#8208;AEH was analyzed by dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy. Using the stereoselective two&#8208;step reduction of a prochiral diketone substrate, we show that the inCell&#8208;AEH approach can be advantageously used in whole&#8208;cell flow biocatalysis, by which flow reactors could be operated for &gt;4&#8197;days under constant substrate perfusion. More importantly, the inCell&#8208;AEH concept enables the recovery of efficient catalyst materials for stable flow bioreactors in a simple and economical one&#8208;step procedure from crude bacterial lysates. We believe that our method will contribute to further optimization of sustainable biocatalytic processes.

         <title>Improved Dye Survival in Expansion Microscopy through Stabilizer&#8208;Conjugated Linkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of stabilizer&#8208;containing multifunctional molecules has been developed and evaluated in expansion microscopy. These multifunctional molecules not only enable effective protection of dyes from radicals during polymerization, but also improve photostability while showing no negative impact on polymerization.







Abstract
Expansion microscopy (ExM) has been widely used to detect biomolecules in cultured cells and tissue samples due to its enablement of super resolution imaging with conventional microscopes, via physical expansion of samples.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A series of&lt;/b&gt; stabilizer-containing multifunctional molecules has been developed and evaluated in expansion microscopy. These multifunctional molecules not only enable effective protection of dyes from radicals during polymerization, but also improve photostability while showing no negative impact on polymerization.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expansion microscopy (ExM) has been widely used to detect biomolecules in cultured cells and tissue samples due to its enablement of super resolution imaging with conventional microscopes, via physical expansion of samples. However, reaction conditions inherent to the process bring about strong fluorescent signal loss during polymerization and digestion and thus limit the brightness of the signal obtained post expansion. Here, we explore the impact of stabilizer-containing organic fluorophores in ExM, as a mitigation strategy for this radical-induced dye degradation. Through direct conjugation of 4-nitrophenylalanine (NPA) to our previously developed trifunctional reagents, we validate and demonstrate that these multifunctional linkers enable visualization of different organelles with improved fluorescent intensity, owning to protection of the dyes to radical induced degradation as well as to photoprotection upon imaging. At this point, we cannot disentangle the relative contribution of both mechanisms. Furthermore, we report anchoring linkers that allow straightforward application of NPA or Trolox to commercially available fluorophore-conjugated antibodies. We show that these anchoring linkers enable complete retention of biological targets while increasing fluorophore photostability. Our results provide guidance in exploring these stabilizer-modified agents in ExM and methods for increased signal survival through the polymerization steps of the ExM protocols.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Oxidizing Ruthenium(II) Complexes with Enhanced Visible&#8208;Light Absorption and G&#8208;quadruplex DNA Binding Abilities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru(II) complexes that gather strong photo&#8208;oxidizing power and enhanced visible&#8208;light absorption were prepared with the highly conjugated dph or bpph ligands. Biolayer interferometry and NCI Surface analyses show their avid binding to G&#8208;quadruplex DNA particularly arising from interaction within the G&#8208;quadruplex groove.







Abstract
Photosensitizers that gather high photo&#8208;oxidizing power and strong visible&#8208;light absorption are of great interest in the development of new photo&#8208;chemotherapeutics. Indeed, such compounds constitute attractive candidates for the design of type I photosensitizers that are not dependent on the presence of oxygen. In this paper, we report on the synthesis and studies of new ruthenium(II) complexes that display strong visible&#8208;light absorption and can oxidize guanine residues under visible&#8208;light irradiation, as evidenced by nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The reported compounds also tightly bind to G&#8208;quadruplex DNA structures from the human telomeric sequence (TTAGGG repeat). The kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the interaction of these Ru(II) complexes with G&#8208;quadruplex and duplex DNA were studied thanks to luminescence titrations and bio&#8208;layer interferometry measurements, which revealed higher affinities towards the non&#8208;canonical G&#8208;quadruplex architecture. Docking experiments and non&#8208;covalent ionic analysis allowed us to gain information on the mode and the strength of the interaction of the compounds towards G&#8208;quadruplex and duplex DNA. The different studies emphasize the substantial influence of the position and the number of non&#8208;chelating nitrogen atoms on the interaction with both types of DNA secondary structures.

         <title>1,2,5&#8208;Triarylcycloalka[c]arsoles: Structural Effects of Fused&#8208;cycloalkanes on Stability and Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclopentane&#8208; and cyclohexane&#8208;fused arsoles were also synthesized. While the former was stable, the latter gradually decomposed to the corresponding diketone under ambient conditions owing to its frustrated structure. The frustration of the fused cyclohexane also caused large structural relaxation, resulting in a relatively large Stokes shift.







Abstract
Herein, we have synthesized a variety of cycloalkane&#8208;fused arsoles. Cyclopentane and cyclohexane were incorporated into the cycloalkane&#8208;fused arsoles. Surprisingly, cyclohexane&#8208;fused arsole 2&#8201;a gradually decomposed via oxidative ring&#8208;opening under ambient conditions, while cyclopentane&#8208;fused 1&#8201;a was stable. In addition, the Stokes shift of 2&#8201;a (7766&#8197;cm&#8722;1) is larger than that of 1&#8201;a (5120&#8197;cm&#8722;1). The effects of the fused cycloalkane on the stability and photophysical properties were attributed to the distortion of the cycloalkane. Computational calculations demonstrated that the cyclohexane moiety in 2&#8201;a was frustrated upon being incorporated into the rigid arsole ring, while the cyclopentane moiety in 1&#8201;a was much less distorted.

         <title>Robust Spirobifluorene Core&#8208;based Hole Transporters with High Mobility for Long&#8208;life Green Phosphorescent Organic Light&#8208;emitting Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using a tailored high triplet energy hole transport layer (HTL) is an efficient way to improve the efficiency and extend the lifetime of organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs), which can use all molecular excitons of singlets and triplets. In this study, dibenzofuran (DBF)&#8208;end&#8208;capped and spirobifluorene (SBF) core&#8208;based HTLs referred as  TDBFSBF1  and  TDBFSBF2  were effectively developed.  TDBFSBF1  exhibited a high glass transition temperature of 178 &#176;C and triplet energy of 2.5 eV. Moreover, a high external quantum efficiency of 22.0%, long operational lifetime at 50% of the initial luminance of 89,000 h, and low driving voltage at 1000 cd m  &#8722;2  of 2.95 V were achieved in green phosphorescent OLEDs using  TDBFSBF1  . Further, a high&#8208;hole mobility &#181;  h  value of 1.9 &#180; 10  &#8722;3  cm  2  V  &#8722;1  s  &#8722;1  was recorded in  TDBFSBF2  . A multiscale simulation successfully reproduced the experimental &#181;  h  values and indicated that the reorganization energy was the primary factor in determining the mobility differences among these SBF core&#8208;based HTLs.</dc:description>

         <title>s&#8208;Holes in Iodonium Ylides: Halogen&#8208;Bond Activation of Carboxylic Acids, Phenols and Thiophenols May Enable Their X&#8211;H Insertion Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first systematic evaluation of the electrostatic potential energy maps of iodonium ylides was conducted. We determined that they possess two s&#8208;holes of differing electron deficiencies, &#160;with the more electropositive s&#8208;hole located opposite the dative I&#8211;C bond to the &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyl motif, and the lesser electropositive s&#8208;hole located opposite the iodoarene C&#8211;I bond. We also conducted the first systematic evaluation of carboxylic acids, phenols and thiophenols in the O/S&#8211;alkylation reaction of iodonium ylides. While carboxylic acids and thiophenols were found to be generally viable, only phenols possessing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents were effective. This high&#8208;yielding and highly chemoselective reaction is believed to involve halogen&#8208;bond activation of heteroatoms, and nicely complements existing diazo&#8208;based methods for alkylation of acidic functional groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Property Relationship of Cyano&#8208; Functionalized Conjugated Polymers for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugated polymers (CPs) have garnered increasing attention in the field of photocatalysis due to their stability and molecular tunability. Understanding the structure&#8208;property relationship in CPs and addressing appropriate molecular design strategies are pivotal to improving the photocatalytic performance of CPs. Herein, a new efficient cyano (CN) engineering approach was proposed to promote the photocatalytic performance of CPs, and three representative CP&#8208;based photocatalysts with different CN contents were tailor&#8208;made to investigate the relationship between CN functionalization and photocatalytic activity. A series of systematically experimental and theoretical studies reveal that CN functionalization contributes to strengthening the donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) interaction, enhancing the light absorption ability, charge separation/transfer efficiency, and hydrophilicity of CPs, and also facilitating the output of separated photoinduced electrons from CPs to Pt cocatalyst. Thus, the dicyano&#8208;functionalized polymer (P&#8208;2CN) manifests an attractive photocatalytic performance in hydrogen production. This study provides a facile strategy to develop excellent CP&#8208;based photocatalysts for solar fuel production.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Conjugated polymers (CPs) have garnered increasing attention in the field of photocatalysis due to their stability and molecular tunability. Understanding the structure-property relationship in CPs and addressing appropriate molecular design strategies are pivotal to improving the photocatalytic performance of CPs. Herein, a new efficient cyano (CN) engineering approach was proposed to promote the photocatalytic performance of CPs, and three representative CP-based photocatalysts with different CN contents were tailor-made to investigate the relationship between CN functionalization and photocatalytic activity. A series of systematically experimental and theoretical studies reveal that CN functionalization contributes to strengthening the donor-acceptor (D-A) interaction, enhancing the light absorption ability, charge separation/transfer efficiency, and hydrophilicity of CPs, and also facilitating the output of separated photoinduced electrons from CPs to Pt cocatalyst. Thus, the dicyano-functionalized polymer (P-2CN) manifests an attractive photocatalytic performance in hydrogen production. This study provides a facile strategy to develop excellent CP-based photocatalysts for solar fuel production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantiospecific Syntheses of Congested Atropisomers through Chiral Bis(aryne) Synthetic Equivalents</title>

The third dimension of arynes. Synthetic equivalents of enantiopure bis(aryne) atropisomers derived from BINOL can be generated and reacted in solution with various arynophiles for the fully enantiospecific syntheses of congested large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon atropisomers.







Abstract
The synthetic equivalents of the enantiopure binaphthyl bis(aryne) atropisomers derived from BINOL (1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;naphtol) featuring a stereogenic axis vicinal to the two reactive triple bonds can be generated for the first time in solution in an enantiospecific manner. Using a two&#8208;step sequence based on the bidirectional [4+2] cycloaddition of furan derivatives followed by an aromatizative deoxygenation reaction, several 9,9&#8217;&#8208;bianthracenyl&#8208;based atropisomers could be prepared enantiospecifically in high enantiomeric purity. Alternatively, bidirectional reactions with anthracene, 2&#8208;bromostyrene, and perylene as the arynophiles afforded very congested bis(benzotriptycene), bis(tetraphene) and bis(anthra[1,2,3,4&#8208;ghi]perylene) nanocarbon atropisomers in equally high enantiomeric purity. In complement, cross reactions with two different arynophiles revealed possible. The unusual atropisomer prototypes described in this study open the way to enantiopure nanographene atropisomers designed for functions.

         <title>2D Catalysts for CO2 Photoreduction: Discussing Structure Efficiency Strategies and Prospects for Scaled Production Based on Current Progress</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D view of photocatalysis: This review discusses 2D materials with excellent performance in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, summarizes existing synthetic strategies, and highlights promising batch preparation strategies. Second, our work summarizes the existing applications and modification strategies of various 2D materials in the field of CO2 emission reduction.







Abstract
Currently, the excessive consumption of fossil fuels is accompanied by massive emissions of CO2, leading to severe energy shortages and intensified global warming. It is of great significance to develop and use renewable clean energy while reducing the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. Photocatalytic technology is a promising strategy for carbon dioxide conversion. Clearly, the achievement of the above goals largely depends on the design and construction of catalysts. This review is mainly focused on the application of 2D materials for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The contribution of synthetic strategies to their structure and performance is emphasized. Finally, the current challenges, and prospects of 2D materials for photoreduction of CO2 with high efficiency, even for practical applications are discussed. It is hoped that this review can provide some guidance for the rational design, controllable synthesis of 2D materials, and their application for efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

         <title>Catalysts as Key Enablers for the Synthesis of Bioplastics with Sophisticated Architectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioplastics are one of the answers to environmental pollution and linear material flows. The most promising bioplastic polylactide (PLA) is already replacing conventional plastics in a number of applications. The properties of PLA, however, do not fit for all potential application areas, but they can be altered by the introduction of comonomers. Copolymerizations of lactide (LA) with other lactones like &#949;&#8208;caprolactone (CL) have been established for several years. Nevertheless, controlling a copolymerization remains a challenge due to the high complexity of the system. Copolymerizations of LA with other monomer classes are much less investigated but bear the chance to overcome the limitations in material properties when only lactones are used. The crucial factor for all copolymerizations is the catalyst. It dominates the reaction kinetics and determines the resulting microstructure. In this review copolymerization catalysts for LA are presented divided into catalysts for the synthesis of lactone block copolymers, lactone random copolymers and multimechanistically synthesized copolymers. The selected catalysts are highlighted either owing to their industrially applicable polymerization condition or their non&#8208;standard mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity of E4 (E4 = P4, As4, AsP3) towards low&#8208;valent Al(I) and Ga(I) compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactivity of yellow arsenic and the interpnictogen compound AsP3 towards low&#8208;valent group 13 compounds was investigated. The reactions of [LAl] (1, L = [{N(C6H3iPr2&#8208;2,6)C(Me)}2CH]&#8208;) with As4 and AsP3 lead to [(LAl)2(&#956;,&#951;1:1:1:1&#8208;E4)] (E4 = As4 (3b), AsP3 (3c)) by insertion of two fragments [LAl] into two of the six E&#8208;E edges of the E4 tetrahedra. Furthermore, the reaction of [LGa]&#160;(2) with E4 afforded [LGa(&#951;1:1&#8208;E4)] (E4 = As4 (4b), AsP3 (4c)). In these compounds, only one E&#8208;E bond of the E4 tetrahedra was cleaved. These compounds represent the first examples of the conversion of yellow arsenic and AsP3, respectively, with group 13 compounds. Furthermore, the reactivity of the gallium complexes towards unsaturated transition metal units or polypnictogen (En) ligand complexes was investigated. This leads to the heterobimetallic compounds [(LGa)(&#956;,&#951;2:1:1&#8208;P4)(LNi)] (5a), [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)(&#956;,&#951;4:1:1&#8208;E4)(LGa)] (E = P (6a), As (6b), Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217; = &#951;5&#8208;C5H2tBu3) and [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Ni)(&#951;3:1:1&#8208;E3)(LGa)] (E = P (7a), As (7b)), which combine two different ligand systems in one complex (nacnac and Cp) as well as two different types of metals (main group and transition metals). The products were characterized by crystallographic and spectroscopic methods.</dc:description>

         <title>An Endoplasmic Reticulum Targeting Type I Photosensitizer for Effective Photodynamic Therapy against Hypoxic Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organelle&#8208;targeted type I photodynamic therapy (PDT) shows great potential to overcome the hypoxic microenvironment in solid tumors. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an indispensable organelle in cells with important biological functions. When ER is damaged due to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the accumulation of misfolded proteins will interfere with ER homeostasis, resulting in ER stress. Here, an ER&#8208;targeted benzophenothiazine&#8208;based photosensitizer NBS&#8208;ER was presented. ER targeting modification significantly reduced the dark toxicity and improved phototoxicity index (PI). NBS&#8208;ER could effectively produce O  2  &#713;&#729;with near&#8208;infrared irradiation, making its phototoxicity under hypoxia close to that under normoxia. Meanwhile, the photoinduced ROS triggered ER stress and induced apoptosis. In addition, NBS&#8208;ER possessed excellent photodynamic therapeutic effect in 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating CoFeOX Nanosheets Towards Enhanced CO2 Photoreduction to Syngas: Effect of Calcination Temperature and Mixed&#8208;Valence Multi&#8208;Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CoFeOX  nanosheets were synthesized by a facile coprecipitation and calcination method. The effect of calcination temperature on the crystal texture, morphology and surface areas of CoFeOX  were fully explored. CoFeOX  sample calcined at 600 &#176;C (CoFeOX  &#8208;600) showed superior catalytic performance for the reduction of CO2  under visible light. Compared with the pure Ru(bpy)32+  &#8208;sensitized CO2  reduction system, the CoFeOX  &#8208;added system achieved 19&#8208;fold enhancement of CO production (45.7 &#956;mol/h). The mixed valence state and nanosheet&#8208;like structure of CoFeOX  cocatalyst support its ultra&#8208;high charge transfer and abundant CO2  active adsorption sites exposure, which promote the separation of photogenerated charges, and thus improve the photocatalytic CO2  reduction activity. Carbon source of CO from CO2  was verified by  13CO2  isotopic labelling experiment. Repeated activity experiments confirmed the good stability of CoFeOX  in the CO2  photoreduction system. This work would provide prospective insights into developing novel cost&#8208;effective, efficient, and durable non&#8208;precious metal cocatalysts to improve the efficiency of photocatalytic reduction of CO2  .</dc:description>

         <title>Systematic modulation of thiol functionalities in inexpensive porous polymers for effective mercury removal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mercury (Hg) contamination in aquatic systems still poses serious health risks through accumulation despite the strict regulations on drinking water and industrial discharge. One effective strategy is adsorptive removal, where a suitably functionalized porous material is added to water treatment protocols. Thiol (SH) group grafted structures perform commendably without due attention to the cost, scalability, and reusability and how the arrangement of sulfur atoms could affect the Hg (II) binding strength. We use an inexpensive and scalable porous covalent organic polymer (COP&#8208;130) to systematically introduce thiol functional groups with precise chain lengths and sulfur content. The thiol&#8208;functionalized COP&#8208;130 demonstrates enhanced wettability and excellent Hg (II) uptake up to 936 mg g&#8208;1, with fast kinetics and exceptionally high selectivity. These Hg adsorbents are easily regenerated with HCl and used at least six times even after strong acid treatments without loss of capacity, a rare performance in the Hg removal research domain.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Push&#8208;Pull Diphenylsulfone Derivatives towards Aggregation&#8208;Induced Narrowband Deep&#8208;Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Narrowband deep&#8208;blue  thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials have attracted significant attention. Herein, four asymmetrical structured TADF emitters based on diphenylsulfone (DPS) acceptor and 9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridine (DMAC) donor with progressive performances were developed. The te  rt  &#8208;butyloxy auxiliary electron&#8208;donor was adopted to restrict the intramolecular rotations and provide efficient steric hindrance. Regioisomerization by altering the substitution position of DMAC on DPS unit further enhanced the intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular interactions.  The accompanying effects yielded increased energy level, minimized reorganization energy, and inhibited non&#8208;radiative transitions in the crystals of t  BuO&#8208;SO m  AD  , which achieved narrowband deep&#8208;blue emission peaking at 424 nm (FWHM = 64 nm, &#934;  F  = 33.6%) through aggregation&#8208;induced blue&#8208;shifted emission (AIBSE). In addition, deep&#8208;blue organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on t  BuO&#8208;SO m  AD  realized the electroluminescence (EL) spectrum peaking located at 435 nm and CIE coordination of (0.12, 0.09).</dc:description>

         <title>Investigating the active oxidants involved in cytochrome P450 catalyzed sulfoxidation reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cytochrome P450 (CYP) heme&#8208;thiolate monooxygenases catalyze the hydroxylation of the C&#8208;H bonds of organic molecules. This reaction is initiated by a ferryl&#8208;oxo heme radical cation (Cpd I). These enzymes can also catalyze sulfoxidation reactions and the ferric&#8208;hydroperoxy complex (Cpd 0) and the Fe(III)&#8211;H  2  O  2  complex have been proposed as alternative oxidants for this transformation. To investigate this, we compared the oxidation of 4&#8208;alkylthiobenzoic acids and 4&#8208;methoxybenzoic acid by the CYP199A4 enzyme from  Rhodopseudomonas palustris  HaA2 using both monooxygenase and peroxygenase pathways. By examining mutants at the mechanistically important, conserved acid alcohol&#8208;pair (D251N, T252A and T252E) we were able to disturb the relative amounts of the reactive intermediates that would form in these reactions. Substrate binding and X&#8208;ray crystal structures enabled us to understand changes in the activity and attempt to evaluate whether multiple oxidants can participate in these reactions. In peroxygenase reactions the T252E mutant had higher activity towards sulfoxidation than  O  &#8208;demethylation but in the monooxygenase reactions with the WT enzyme the activity of both reactions was similar. The peroxygenase activity of the T252A mutant was greater for sulfoxidation reactions than the WT enzyme, which is the reverse of the activity changes observed for  O  &#8208;demethylation. The monooxygenase activity and coupling efficiency of sulfoxidation and oxidative demethylation were reduced by similar degrees with the T252A mutant. These observations infer that while Cpd I is required for  O  &#8208;dealkylation, another oxidant may contribute to sulfoxidation. Based on the activity of the CYP199A4 mutants we propose that this is the Fe(III)&#8211;H  2  O  2  complex which would be more abundant in the peroxide&#8208;driven reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics of RGO&#8208;Wrapped CNF/GO Aerogels with Controlled Pore Structures via PVA&#8208;assisted Freeze&#8208;casting Approach for Efficient Sound and Microwave Absorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acoustic absorption materials play an important role in eliminating the negative effects of noise. Herein, a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)&#8208;assisted freeze&#8208;casting was developed for controllably fabricating reduced graphene oxide wrapped&#8208;carbon nanofiber (RGO@CNF)/graphene oxide composite aerogel. During the freeze&#8208;casting, PVA was used as an icing inhibitor to control the size of ice crystals. While the concentration of PVA increases from 0 to 15 mg&#183;ml  &#8208;1  , the average pore size of the aerogel reduces from 154 to 45 &#956;m. Due to the modulation of the pore size and composition, the propagation path and friction loss for sound are optimized, especially at low frequency. For instance, the normalized sound absorption coefficient of RGO@CNF/GO&#8208;10 achieves 0.79 (250&#8208;6300Hz). The sample also exhibits a desirable microwave absorbing property whose maximum reflection loss is &#8208;47.3 dB (9.44 GHz, d=3.0 mm). Prospectively, this synthetic strategy can be extended to develop other forms of elastic aerogel with a controlled pore size.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The emergence of (CH  3  NH  3  )PbI  3  has brought the development of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite (OIHP) structures with ABX  3  type to a higher level, however, most 3D frameworks are constructed by corner&#8208;sharing of BX  6  octahedra. Here, we substituted the spherical molecule 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (2.2.2&#8208;dabco) with 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.2.2]nonane (1,4&#8208;3.2.2&#8208;dabcn) as a template to react with RbX (X = Br and I) in the corresponding HX acids under the consideration of reducing the molecular symmetry. Two 3D OIHP compounds [1,4&#8208;3.2.2&#8208;H  2  dabcn]RbI  3  &#183;H  2  O (  1  ) and [1,4&#8208;3.2.2&#8208;H  2  dabcn]RbBr  3  (  2  ) crystallized in non&#8208;centrosymmetric point group  mm  2 before the phase transition point were isolated. Among them, the 3D inorganic framework of  1  is constructed by sharing the corner of [RbI  6  ] octahedra, while that of  2  is constructed by sharing the corner and face of [RbBr  6  ] octahedra to acquire large cavities to accommodate the organic amine cation [1,4&#8208;3.2.2&#8208;H  2  dabcn]  2+  , this 3D framework type is unprecedented in the OIHPs. As expected, compounds  1  and  2  exhibit reversible phase transition, dielectric and second harmonic generation (SHG) and ferroelectric properties, in which the phase transition temperature of  2  at 374 K is much higher than compound  1  at 280 K.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Studies Towards the Calcium&#8208;Dependent Lipopeptide Antibiotic Cadaside B</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the current global crisis of antimicrobial resistance, antimicrobial peptides represent a promising source of alternative antibiotics. Recently discovered cadaside B, a novel calcium&#8208;dependent antibiotic, exhibits potent antimicrobial activity towards Gram&#8208;positive pathogens including multi&#8208;drug resistant strains. These properties, coupled with a novel structure, non&#8208;cytotoxicity, and low likelihood of developing resistance render cadaside B an important synthetic target. Herein, a synthetic strategy towards cadaside B is reported with the key steps involving on&#8208;resin depsipeptide bond formation and solution&#8208;phase macrolactamization. Good agreement of the synthetic cadaside B MS/MS fragmentation pattern was observed with the natural product, but a different  1  H NMR spectrum and absence of antimicrobial activity suggest an undetected epimerization event took place during the synthesis. Herein the findings of our synthetic journey and suggestions for future directions are presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Restrictive Regulation of Ionic Liquid Quaternary Ammonium Salt in SBA&#8208;15 Pore Channel for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SBA&#8208;15 with metal based quaternary ammonium salt was used for the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides. Ionic liquids grafting into the pore channel of SBA&#8208;15 provide an alternative chance to improve the catalytic performance at 1.5&#8197;MPa and 90 &#176;C.







Abstract
Herein, the synthesis of a new type of catalyst, SBA&#8722;M (Schiff complex of different metal types grafted on SBA&#8208;15) based on a quaternization reaction, is described. Various amounts of ionic liquid were grafted into the pore channels of SBA&#8208;15 using the post&#8208;grafting method, which allowed the ionic liquid to be grafted into the pore channels restrictively. Notably, over six cycles, SBA&#8722;Mn (0.2) has been shown to maintain its catalytic activity and stability. In addition, a reaction mechanism for the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides based on density&#8208;functional theory is proposed. The cycloaddition reaction of CO2 and epoxides is an efficient way of carbon fixation. It is demonstrated that the metal coordinated with the oxygen atom of the epoxides and that a halogen attacked the carbon of epoxides. Moreover, theoretical calculations and synthesis strategy provide a new approach for CO2 conversion.

         <title>Characterization of a Novel Cytochrome Involved in Geobacter sulfurreducens&#8217; Electron Harvesting Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The periplasmic cytochrome GSU2515 is crucial for the electron harvesting pathways of Geobacter sulfurreducens, a suitable bacterium to apply in microbial electrosynthesis technologies. The biophysical characterization of GSU2515 together with biomolecular interactions and electron transfer experiments highlighted how electrons are conducted within the periplasm and pave the way for understanding the bacterium's electron harvesting pathways.







Abstract
Electron harvesting bacteria are key targets to develop microbial electrosynthesis technologies, which are valid alternatives for the production of value&#8208;added compounds without utilization of fossil fuels. Geobacter sulfurreducens, that is capable of donating and accepting electrons from electrodes, is one of the most promising electroactive bacteria. Its electron transfer mechanisms to electrodes have been progressively elucidated, however the electron harvesting pathways are still poorly understood. Previous studies showed that the periplasmic cytochromes PccH and GSU2515 are overexpressed in current&#8208;consuming G. sulfurreducens biofilms. PccH was characterized, though no putative partners have been identified. In this work, GSU2515 was characterized by complementary biophysical techniques and in silico simulations using the AlphaFold neural network. GSU2515 is a low&#8208;spin monoheme cytochrome with a disordered N&#8208;terminal region and an &#945;&#8208;helical C&#8208;terminal domain harboring the heme group. The cytochrome undergoes a redox&#8208;linked heme axial ligand switch, with Met91 and His94 as distal axial ligands in the reduced and oxidized states, respectively. The reduction potential of the cytochrome is negative and modulated by the pH in the physiological range: &#8722;78&#8197;mV at pH&#8197;6 and &#8722;113&#8197;mV at pH&#8197;7. Such pH&#8208;dependence coupled to the redox&#8208;linked switch of the axial ligand allows the cytochrome to drive a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer step that is crucial to confer directionality to the respiratory chain. Biomolecular interactions and electron transfer experiments indicated that GSU2515 and PccH form a redox complex. Overall, the data obtained highlight for the first time how periplasmic proteins bridge the electron transfer between the outer and inner membrane in the electron harvesting pathways of G. sulfurreducens.

From amine to imine more easily: A fan&#8208;like hollow N&#8208;doped C&#8208;coated AgCl/Pd heterostructure has been synthesized by pyrolysis of a AgCl/Pd@Bim precursor under argon. The interface effect of the AgCl/Pd heterostructure efficiently regulates the electronic structure and accelerates the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers, leading to excellent photocatalytic activity toward oxidative coupling of amine to imine.







Abstract
Rationally designing interface structure to modulate the electronic structure of a photocatalyst is an efficient strategy to facilitate the separation and migration of photogenerated charge carriers and improve photocatalytic activity. In this work, a AgCl/Pd heterostructure encapsulated by N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (AgCl/Pd@N&#8722;C) with a fan&#8208;like morphology assembled hollow tubes was synthesized by pyrolysis of a AgCl/Pd@Bim precursor. The unique interface structure not only increases the number of photogenerated charge carriers, but also provides an effective channel for the separation of electrons and holes, which have been proved by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. As expected, the obtained AgCl/Pd&#8208;3@N&#8722;C exhibited greatly enhanced conversion efficiency and recyclability toward the photocatalytic oxidative coupling of amine under blue&#8208;light irradiation.

         <title>Terpyridine Diphosphine Ruthenium Complexes as Efficient Photocatalysts for the Transfer Hydrogenation of Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new cationic ruthenium [RuCl(PP)(tpy)]X (X=Cl, PF6) complexes, prepared from [RuCl2(PPh3)3] a diphosphine and 2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine (tpy), promote the photocatalytical transfer hydrogenation (TH) of carbonyl compounds in 2&#8208;propanol under mild conditions. Unprecedented asymmetric catalytic TH of acetophenone driven by light was obtained with ruthenium tpy complexes containing the chiral Skewphos diphosphine.







Abstract
The cationic achiral and chiral terpyridine diphosphine ruthenium complexes [RuCl(PP)(tpy)]Cl (PP=dppp (1), (R,R)&#8208;Skewphos (2) and (S,S)&#8208;Skewphos (3)) are easily obtained in 85&#8211;88&#8201;% yield through a one&#8208;pot synthesis from [RuCl2(PPh3)3], the diphosphine and 2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine (tpy) in 1&#8208;butanol. Treatment of 1&#8211;3 with NaPF6 in methanol at RT affords quantitatively the corresponding derivatives [RuCl(PP)(tpy)]PF6 (PP=dppp (1&#8201;a), (R,R)&#8208;Skewphos (2&#8201;a) and (S,S)&#8208;Skewphos (3&#8201;a)). Reaction of [RuCl2(PPh3)3] with (S,R)&#8208;Josiphos or (R)&#8208;BINAP in toluene, followed by treatment with tpy in 1&#8208;butanol and finally with NaPF6 in MeOH gives [RuCl(PP)(tpy)]PF6 (PP=(S,R)&#8208;Josiphos (4&#8201;a), (R)&#8208;BINAP (5&#8201;a)) isolated in 78&#8201;% and 86&#8201;% yield, respectively. The chiral derivatives have been isolated as single stereoisomers and 3&#8201;a, 4&#8201;a have been characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. The tpy complexes with NaOiPr display high photocatalytic activity in the transfer hydrogenation (TH) of carbonyl compounds using 2&#8208;propanol as the only hydrogen donor and visible light at 30&#8201;&#176;C, at remarkably high S/C (up to 5000) and TOF values up to 264&#8197;h&#8722;1. The chiral enantiomers 2, 2&#8201;a and 3, 3&#8201;a induce the asymmetric photocatalytic TH of acetophenone, affording (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol with 51 and 52&#8201;% ee, respectively, in a MeOH/2&#8208;propanol mixture.

         <title>A Rapid Access to&#160;Chiral and&#160;Tripodal Cavitands from&#160;&#946;&#8208;Pinene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we report Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclotrimerization of (+)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;bromoenone,  &#160;  obtained from monoterpene&#160;  b  &#8208; pinene, into an enantiopure cyclotrimer. This  &#160;C  3  &#160;symmetric compound has three bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane rings fused to its central benzene with each ring carrying a carbonyl group. The cyclotrimer undergoes diastereoselective threefold alkynylation with lithium salts of five terminal alkynes (41&#8208;63%,&#160;  de  % = 4&#8208;83). The addition enabled a rapid synthesis of a small library of novel chiral cavitands that in shape resemble a tripod stand. These molecular tripods include a&#160;  tris  &#8208;bicycloannelated benzene head attached to three alkyne legs twisted in one direction to form a nonpolar cavity with polar groups as feet. Tripods with methylpyridinium and methylisoquinolinium legs, respectively, form inclusion complexes with anti&#8208;inflammatory and chiral drugs (  R  )/(  S  )&#8208;ibuprofen and (  R  )/(  S  )&#8208;naproxen. The mode of binding shows drug molecules docked in the cavity of the host via ion&#8208;ion, cation &#8208;p , and C&#8208;H &#8208;p &#160;contacts that, in addition of desolvation, give rise to complexes having mM to&#160; m M stability in water. Our findings open the door for creating a myriad of enantiopure tripods with tunable functions that, in the future, may give novel chemosensors, catalysts or sequestering agents.</dc:description>

         <title>A Silicon&#8208;Stereogenic Silanol &#8211; 18O&#8208;Isotope Labeling and Stereogenic Probe Reveals Hidden Stereospecific Water Exchange Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A silicon&#8208;stereogenic aminosilanol was isolated in excellent diastereomeric ratio and the absolute configuration was determined. The silanol is configurative and condensation stable in solution and shows stereoselective transformations with a clean stereospecific pathway in follow&#8208;up reactions, which leads to the isolation of a silicon&#8208;stereogenic zinc complex and siloxane compounds. Investigations with  18  O&#8208;labelled water and mass spectrometry analysis revealed an otherwise hidden exchange of oxygen atoms of silanol and water in solution that proceeds with retention of the configuration at the silicon center. This novel combination of a stereochemical probe and isotopic labeling in a silicon&#8208;stereogenic compound opens new analytic possibilities to study stereochemical courses of reactions with the aid of chiral silanols mechanistically.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Charge Transport in Carbon Nitride Modulated by Interfacial Chemical Bond and Homophase Junction to Boost Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient separation of photogenerated electrons and holes is of key importance in photocatalysis. Tuning the charge separation pathway is significant but still suffering from low efficiency for the charge extraction from semiconductors. Herein, taking 2D g&#8208;C  3  N  4  (CN) nanosheets as a model photocatalyst, we found the decoration of homophase junction between brookite TiO  2  rods and nanoparticles (B  N  &#8208;B  R  ) onto CN can effectively modulate photogenerated charge extraction and transfer in B  N  &#8208;B  R  /CN composites. The B  N  &#8208;B  R  /CN exhibits a remarkably enhanced photocatalytic H  2  evolution under visible light irradiation (&#955; &gt; 420 nm) compared with the single component.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Efficient separation of photogenerated electrons and holes is of key importance in photocatalysis. Tuning the charge separation pathway is significant but still suffering from low efficiency for the charge extraction from semiconductors. Herein, taking 2D g-C  3  N  4  (CN) nanosheets as a model photocatalyst, we found the decoration of homophase junction between brookite TiO  2  rods and nanoparticles (B  N  -B  R  ) onto CN can effectively modulate photogenerated charge extraction and transfer in B  N  -B  R  /CN composites. The B  N  -B  R  /CN exhibits a remarkably enhanced photocatalytic H  2  evolution under visible light irradiation (&#955; &amp;gt; 420 nm) compared with the single component. A continuous electron transfer channel constructed by an interfacial chemical bond Ti-O-N between CN and brookite rods (B  R  ) and B  N  -B  R  homophase junction between brookite nanoparticles and rods was proposed to benefit the charge extraction and transfer. Our work provides a strategy to tune the charge separation and transfer to facilitate the photocatalytic performance in heterogeneous photocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Computational insights on reactivity: The stereoselective copper&#8208;mediated intramolecular C&#8722;H bond hydroxylation is investigated using DFT calculations. The computed mechanism involves a dinuclear side&#8208;on &#956;&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;peroxo dicopper(II) adduct in equilibrium with the key oxidizing intermediate bis(&#956;&#8208;oxo) dicopper(III) species. The difference of reactivity towards internal substrates bearing activated or non&#8208;activated C&#8722;H bonds is rationalized.







Abstract
The stereoselective copper&#8208;mediated hydroxylation of intramolecular C&#8722;H bonds from tridentate ligands is reinvestigated using DFT calculations. The computational study aims at deciphering the mechanism of C&#8722;H hydroxylation obtained after reaction of Cu(I) precursors with dioxygen, using ligands bearing either activated (L1) or non&#8208;activated (L2) C&#8722;H bonds. Configurational analysis allows rationalization of the experimentally observed regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The computed mechanism involves the formation of a side&#8208;on peroxide species (P) in equilibrium with the key intermediate bis&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;oxo) isomer (O) responsible for the C&#8722;H activation step. The P/O equilibrium yields the same activation barrier for the two complexes. However, the main difference between the two model complexes is observed during the C&#8722;H activation step, where the complex bearing the non&#8208;activated C&#8722;H bonds yields a higher energy barrier, accounting for the experimental lack of reactivity of this complex under those conditions.

         <title>C&#8722;H Activation of Inert Arenes using a Photochemically Activated Guanidinato&#8208;Magnesium(I) Compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical approach. Activations of arene C&#8722;H bonds by a photochemically excited dimagnesium(I) compound are reported (see picture, Dip=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl). Experimental and theoretical evidence for the intermediacy of magnesium radicals in these reactions is presented. Such transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C&#8722;H bond activations hold considerable potential for organic synthesis.







Abstract
UV irradiation of solutions of a guanidinate coordinated dimagnesium(I) compound, [{(Priso)Mg}2] 3 (Priso=[(DipN)2CNPri2]&#8722;, Dip=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl), in either benzene, toluene, the three isomers of xylene, or mesitylene, leads to facile activation of an aromatic C&#8722;H bond of the solvent in all cases, and formation of aryl/hydride bridged magnesium(II) products, [{(Priso)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;H)(&#956;&#8208;Ar)] 4&#8211;9. In contrast to similar reactions reported for &#946;&#8208;diketiminate coordinated counterparts of 3, these C&#8722;H activations proceed with little regioselectivity, though they are considerably faster. Reaction of 3 with an excess of the pyridine, p&#8208;NC5H4But (pyBut), gave [(Priso)Mg(pyButH)(pyBut)2] 10, presumably via reduction of the pyridine to yield a radical intermediate, [(Priso)Mg(pyBut&#8901;)(pyBut)2] 11, which then abstracts a proton from the reaction solvent or a reactant. DFT calculations suggest two possible pathways to the observed arene C&#8722;H activations. One of these involves photochemical cleavage of the Mg&#8722;Mg bond of 3, generating magnesium(I) doublet radicals, (Priso)Mg&#8901;. These then doubly reduce the arene substrate to give &#8220;Birch&#8208;like&#8221; products, which subsequently rearrange via C&#8722;H activation of the arene. Circumstantial evidence for the photochemical generation of transient magnesium radical species includes the fact that irradiation of a cyclohexane solution of 3 leads to an intramolecular aliphatic C&#8722;H activation process and formation of an alkyl&#8208;bridged magnesium(II) species, [{Mg(&#956;&#8208;Priso&#8722;H)}2] 12. Furthermore, irradiation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of 3 and the &#946;&#8208;diketiminato dimagnesium(I) compound, [{(DipNacnac)Mg}2] (DipNacnac=[HC(MeCNDip)2]&#8722;), effects a &#8220;scrambling&#8221; reaction, and the near quantitative formation of an unsymmetrical dimagnesium(I) compound, [(Priso)Mg&#8722;Mg(DipNacnac)] 13. Finally, the EPR spectrum (77&#8197;K) of a glassed solution of UV irradiated 3 is dominated by a broad featureless signal, indicating the presence of a doublet radical species.

         <title>Borate Buffer as a Key Player in Cu&#8208;Based Homogeneous Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A BO33&#8722; anion from borate buffer provides a structural bridge between low&#8208;cost Cu complexes to form a new in situ trinuclear complex as a fast electrocatalyst for homogeneous water oxidation; likewise, the borate species from the buffer solution at pH&#8197;9 facilitate the high turnover frequency (TOF) by playing a significant role in the O&#8208;O bond formation step.







Abstract
Borate buffer was found to have both structural and functional roles within a low&#8208;cost tri&#8208;copper electrocatalyst for homogeneous water oxidation that exhibits a high turnover frequency of 310&#8197;s&#8722;1. The borate buffer was shown to facilitate the catalytic activity by both bridging the three Cu ions and participating in O&#8722;O bond formation. Phosphate and acetate buffers did not show such roles, making borate a unique player in this catalytic system.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of gem&#8208;Difluoro&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;Allyl Boronates and Silanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical synthesis of fluorinated allyl silanes and boronates is disclosed. Through the electrogeneration of boryl and silyl radical a panel of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl or &#945;&#8208;difluoromethylstyrenes was converted into the corresponding allyl silanes and boronates in good to excellent yields (64&#8197;examples, from 31&#8201;% to 95&#8201;% yield). A scale up of the reactions under continuous flow was showcased and the synthetic utility of these building blocks was highlighted through versatile transformations.







Abstract
The electrochemical synthesis of fluorinated allyl silanes and boronates was disclosed. The addition of electrogenerated boryl or silyl radicals onto many &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl or &#945;&#8208;difluoromethylstyrenes in an undivided cell allowed the formation of a large panel of synthetically useful gem&#8208;difluoro and &#947;&#8208;fluoroallyl boronates and silanes (64&#8197;examples, from 31&#8201;% to 95&#8201;% yield). In addition, a scale up of the reactions under continuous flow was showcased using an electrochemical reactor with promising volumetric productivity (688&#8197;g.L&#8722;1.h&#8722;1 and 496&#8197;g.L&#8722;1.h&#8722;1). Moreover, the synthetic utility of these building blocks was highlighted through versatile transformations. Finally, plausible reaction mechanisms were suggested to explain the formation of the products.

         <title>Harnessing Water to Enhance Quadrupolar NMR Spectroscopy and Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
17O and 14N are attractive targets for in&#8197;vivo NMR imaging, but low gyromagnetic ratios &#947; and fast spin relaxation complicate observations. This work explores indirect ways to detect some of these sites with the help of double&#8208;resonance techniques. These sequences ported the signatures of dilute, low&#8208;g nuclei onto the abundant water 1H signal through the spontaneous exchanges that labile OH and NH protons undergo with H2O. These effects provide new routes in molecular NMR imaging.







Abstract
17O and 14N are attractive targets for in&#8197;vivo NMR spectroscopy and imaging, but low gyromagnetic ratios &#947; and fast spin relaxation complicate observations. This work explores indirect ways of detecting some of these sites with the help of proton&#8208;detected double resonance techniques. As standard coherence transfer methods are of limited use for such indirect detection, alternative routes for probing the quadrupolar spectra on 1H were tested. These centered on modulating the broadening effects imparted onto protons adjacent to the low&#8208;&#947; species through J couplings through either continuous wave or spin&#8208;echo double&#8208;resonance decoupling/recoupling sequences. As in all cases, the changes imparted by these double&#8208;resonance strategies were small due to the fast relaxation undergone by the quadrupoles, the sensitivity of these approaches was amplified by transferring their effects onto the abundant water 1H signal. These amplifications were mediated by the spontaneous exchanges that the labile 1Hs bound to 17O or 14N undergo with the water protons. In experiments designed on the basis of double&#8208;resonance spin echoes, these enhancements were imparted by looping the transverse encodings together with multiple longitudinal storage periods, leading to decoupling&#8208;recoupling with exchange (D&#8208;REX) sequences. In experiments designed on the basis of continuous on/off quadrupolar decoupling, these solvent exchanges were incorporated into chemical&#8208;exchange saturation transfer schemes, leading to decoupling&#8208;recoupling with saturation transfer (D&#8208;REST) sequences. Both of these variants harnessed sizable proportions of the easily detectable water signals, in order to characterize the NMR spectra and/or to image with atomic&#8208;site specificity the 17O and 14N species.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Research of Photo&#8208;Assisted Lithium&#8208;Based Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;based batteries (PALBs) are widely attracting researchers because they can directly convert solar energy into electric energy for storage or output without any intermediate. Highly active photogenerated carriers can enhance the battery reaction and reduce the overpotential in charge and discharge process to increase the energy efficiency. The development of various PALBs is discussed under the aspects of configuration, mechanism, electrodes design and performance.







Abstract
The application of solar energy is crucial for alleviating the energy crisis and achieving sustainable development. In recent years, photo&#8208;assisted rechargeable batteries have attracted researchers because they can directly convert and store solar energy in the batteries. And it also can be used like a normal battery without light illumination. Photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;based batteries have received more attention than other energy storage systems due to their higher energy density and relatively mature development. This Review focuses on the design of various photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;based batteries including Li&#8208;ion, Li&#8208;S, Li&#8208;O2, Li&#8208;CO2 and Li&#8208;I batteries, as well as the working mechanism of photoelectrodes in these battery systems. The basic understanding and challenge of photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;based batteries are also discussed. At last, perspectives for the photoelectrode development are provided in the summary to advance photo&#8208;assisted energy storage systems.

         <title>Ultrathin Niobate Nanosheet Assembly with Au NPs and CdS QDs as a Highly Efficient Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An excellent 2D photocatalyst was synthesized by loading Au nanoparticles and CdS quantum dots on niobate nanosheets. This CdS/Au/HNb3O8 photocatalyst not only increased the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate by 254 times compared with the pure niobate nanosheet, but also showed outstanding photocatalytic performance for oxidative self&#8208;coupling of benzylamine and degradation of organic dyes.







Abstract
Niobate nanosheets have aroused widespread interest in recent years for their prospects in catalysis. The exploration of 2D niobate catalysis with stable and efficient properties is still the focus in chemistry and materials science. Herein, the successful fabrication of 2D CdS/Au/HNb3O8 catalyst is demonstrated which revealed efficient photocatalytic properties in H2 evolution, oxidative self&#8208;coupling of amines to imines, and degradation of dyes. Especially the assembled architecture can give a rate of 5.85&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 of photocatalytic H2 evolution, an &#8764;254&#8208;fold enhancement, compared with bare HNb3O8 nanosheets under identical conditions. In accordance with density functional theory (DFT) and X&#8208;ray adsorption fine structure (XAFS) analyses, the vast improvements are benefited from efficient migration and separation of charge carriers. Besides, the surface plasma resonance (SPR) effect of Au NPs enhances the light harvesting capacity and boosts the generation of hot electrons, efficiently improving the visible&#8208;light absorption.

         <title>Two Novel Three&#8208;Dimensional Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Based Rare Earth MOFs with Ultra&#8208;High Proton Conductivity and Performance Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eu&#8208;ETTB and Gd&#8208;ETTB were obtained with the same topology by self&#8208;assembly. Both materials showed extremely high proton conductivity: the proton conductivity of Eu&#8208;ETTB was 1.53&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 98&#8201;% relative humidity (RH) and 85&#8201;&#176;C, while Gd&#8208;ETTB had a proton conductivity value of 2.63&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 98&#8201;% RH and 75&#8201;&#176;C. Furthermore, both materials had excellent performance both in terms of stability and durability.







Abstract
In this work, the two example rare earth&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (LaIII&#8208;based MOFs), Eu&#8208;ETTB and Gd&#8208;ETTB, were obtained by self&#8208;assembly. Both materials showed extremely high proton conductivity, with the proton conductivity of Eu&#8208;ETTB being 1.53&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 98&#8201;% relative humidity (RH) and 85&#8201;&#176;C and that of Gd&#8208;ETTB being 2.63&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 98&#8201;% RH and 75&#8201;&#176;C. This was almost the best performance observed for three&#8208;dimensional porous MOFs without post&#8208;synthetic modification and was based on milder conditions than for most materials. Furthermore, cycle test experiments and continuous work tests showed that both materials had excellent performance both in terms of stability and durability. Water vapor adsorption experiments showed that a large number of water molecules are adsorbed the hydrogen&#8208;bond network's being rebuilt by the adsorbed water molecules in the pore channel and thus optimizing the channels for proton transfer explained the MOF's high performance.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Controlled Selective Mono&#8208; vs. Di&#8208;ortho&#8208;Arylation for the Synthesis of Arylhydrazine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective formation of mono&#8208; and double&#8208;arylated products at ortho position was feasible via the pyrazolone directing group. The selectivity of the palladium&#8208;catalyzed reaction was controlled by the temperature and derived from the structure of the used directing group. This allowed the achievement of unsymmetrical double&#8208;substituted arylated products in a one&#8208;pot procedure. Ortho&#8208;arylated pyrazolones underwent unusual decarboxylative cleavage under relatively mild conditions to form hydrazones.







Abstract
A method of palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation assisted with a 3,4,4&#8208;trimethylpyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;on directing group, selectively providing mono&#8208; and di&#8208;ortho&#8208;arylated products is reported. Steric hindrance appearing between the directing group and the already introduced aryl substituent enables control of mono&#8208; vs. diarylation selectivity by the temperature of the reaction. Taking advantage of this, a series of monosubstituted and disubstituted derivatives were obtained in good yields. Moreover, unsymmetrical double&#8208;arylation in a one&#8208;pot procedure was developed to give corresponding products in reasonable yields. Additionally, synthesis and X&#8208;ray study of intermediate palladium metallacycles of both, the first and second arylation reactions, were conducted. X&#8208;ray structure comparison emphasizes the geometrical differences that were consistent with the observed reactivity. Finally, decarboxylative cleavage of the pyrazolone directing group under mild conditions gave synthetically useful hydrazones. The presented solution opens the alternative synthetic way to such ortho arylated derivatives of arylhydrazines.

         <title>Leveraging Metal and Ligand Reactive Sites for One Pot Reactions: Ligand&#8208;Centered Borenium Ions for Tandem Catalysis with Palladium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd complexes with triaminoborane&#8208;containing diphosphorous ligands are reported that are capable of tandem cycloaddition and cross&#8208;coupling catalysis using separate reactive sites on the metal and ligand.







Abstract
Tandem catalysts that perform two different organic transformations in a single pot are highly desirable because they enable rapid and efficient assembly of simple organic building blocks into more complex molecules. Many examples of tandem catalysis rely on metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions involving one or more metal complexes. Remarkably, despite surging interest in the development of chemically reactive (i.&#8201;e., non&#8208;innocent) ligands, there are few examples of metal complexes that leverage ligand&#8208;centered reactivity to perform catalytic reactions in tandem with separate catalytic reactions at the metal. Here we report how multifunctional Pd complexes with triaminoborane&#8208;derived diphosphorus ligands, called TBDPhos, appear to facilitate borenium&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition reactions at the ligand, and Pd&#8208;catalyzed Stille and Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reactions at the metal. Both transformations can be accessed in one pot to afford rare examples of tandem catalysis using separate metal and ligand catalysis sites in a single complex.

         <title>Insights into the Effect of the Adsorption Preference of Additives on the Anisotropic Growth of ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Encouraging growth &#8211; more or less: The adsorption preference of eight additives and their role in the anisotropic growth of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite were investigated experimentally and theoretically. Either an inhibition or a promotion effect is revealed by these additives. A descriptor related to the adsorption energy difference between MFI [100]/[101] and [010] surfaces was employed to estimate the ZSM&#8208;5 morphology, which varied from sphere&#8208;like to plate&#8208;like to noodle&#8208;like.







Abstract
Zeolite morphology plays a crucial role in affecting catalytic performance, while is persistently challenging to tailor through crystal anisotropic growth. It has been recognized that specific additives can be introduced into the synthesis of zeolites to achieve anisotropic growth, however their role and the underlying mechanism are not well understood. Herein, the effect of eight specific additives on the anisotropic growth of the ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite is unveiled within the framework of crystallization engineering. Either an inhibition effect or a promotion effect is revealed for each additive according to the crystallization kinetics. The adsorption preference of typical additives on different surfaces was demonstrated by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) and transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy (TXM) together with 3D reconstruction. The calculated adsorption energy difference between MFI [100]/[101] and [010] surfaces was proposed as a key descriptor to estimate the possible morphology induced by additive. ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites varying from sphere&#8208;like, plate&#8208;like to noodle&#8208;like morphology could be synthesized by employing specific additives with increasing adsorption strength difference on distinct surfaces.

         <title>Functional Nanomaterial&#8208;Modified Anodes in Microbial Fuel Cells: Advances and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microbial fuel cell (MFC) is a promising approach that could utilize microorganisms to oxidize biodegradable pollutants in wastewater and generate electrical power simultaneously. Introducing advanced anode nanomaterials is generally considered as an effective way to enhance MFC performance by increasing bacterial adhesion and facilitating bacteria extracellular electron transfer (EET). This review focuses on the key advances of recent anode modification materials, as well as the current understanding of the microbial EET process occurring at the bacteria&#8208;electrode interface. Based on the difference in combination mode of the exoelectrogens and nanomaterials, anode surface modification, hybrid biofilm construction and single&#8208;bacterial surface modification strategies are elucidated exhaustively. The inherent mechanisms may help to break through the performance output bottleneck of MFCs by rational design of EET&#8208;related nanomaterials, and lead to the widespread application of microbial electrochemical systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Primary Amine Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;Arylation of Simple Ketones via Asymmetric retro&#8208;Claisen Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly enantioselective &#945;&#8208;arylation of simple ketones has been achieved by chiral primary amine catalyzed asymmetric retro&#8208;Claisen cleavage of &#946;&#8208;diketones. This mild organocatalytic strategy enables the construction of &#945;&#8208;aryl tertiary carbon stereocenters in good yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98% ee) with the para&#8208;quinone monoimines&#160;as aryl sources. Furthermore, oxidative catalytic asymmetric &#945;&#8208;arylation has also been realized with free p&#8208;aminophenols.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective and Reversible Solvent Uptake in&#160;Tetra&#8208;4&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)phenylmethane&#8208;based Supramolecular Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dynamic behaviour of Supramolecular Organic Frameworks (SOFs) based on the rigid tetra&#8208;4&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)phenylmethane ( TPPM) organic tecton has been elucidated through 3D Electron Diffraction, X&#8208;ray powder diffraction and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analysis. The SOF undergoes a reversible single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal transformation when exposed to vapors of selected organic solvents, moving from a closed structure with isolated small voids to an expanded structure with solvated channel along the b axis. The observed selectivity is dictated by the fitting of the guest in the expanded SOF, following the degree of packing coefficient. The effect of solvent uptake on TPPM solid&#8208;state fluorescence was investigated, evidencing a significant variation in the emission profile only in the presence of chloroform.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to Enantiomerically Pure P&#8208;Stereogenic Primary Aminophosphine Sulfides under Reductive Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stereochemically pure phosphines with phosphorus&#8211;heteroatom bonds and  P&#8208;centered chirality are a promising class of functional building blocks for the design of chiral ligands and organocatalysts. A route to enantiomerically pure primary aminophosphine sulfides was opened through stereospecific reductive C&#8211;N bond cleavage of phosphorus(V) precursors by lithium in liquid ammonia. The chemoselectivity of the reaction as a function of reaction time, substrate pattern, and chiral auxiliary was investigated. In the presence of exclusively aliphatic groups bound to the phosphorus atom, all competing reductive side reactions are totally prevented. The absolute configurations of all  P&#8208;stereogenic compounds were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Their use as synthetic building blocks was demonstrated. The lithium salt of (R)&#8208;BINOL&#8208;dithiophosphoric acid proved to be a useful stereochemical probe to determine the enantiomeric purity. Insights into the coordination mode of the lithium&#8208;based chiral complex formed in solution was provided by NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional Organocatalysts &#8211; Singly&#8208;linked and Macrocyclic Bisphosphoric Acids for Asymmetric Phase&#8208;transfer and Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The linking of phosphoric acids via covalent or mechanical bonds has proven to be a successful strategy for the design of novel organocatalysts. Here, we present the first systematic investigation of singly&#8208;linked and macrocyclic bisphosphoric acids, including their synthesis and their application in phase&#8208;transfer and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. We found that the novel bisphosphoric acids show dramatically increased enantioselectivities in comparison to their &#160;monophosphoric acid analogues. However, the nature, length and number of linkers has a profound influence on the enantioselectivities. In the asymmetric dearomative fluorination via phase&#8208;transfer catalysis, bisphosphoric acids with a single, rigid bisalkyne&#8208;linker give the best results with moderate to good enantiomeric excesses. In contrast, bisphosphoric acids with flexible linkers give excellent enantioselectivities in the transfer&#8208;hydrogenation of quinolines via cooperative Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. In the latter case, sufficiently long linkers are needed for high stereoselectivities, as found experimentally and supported by DFT&#8208;calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Microporous framework (Nb, Fe)&#8208;silicate with much potential to remove rare&#8208;earth elements from waters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoparticles of a new small&#8208;pore metal silicate formulated as Na  2.9  (Nb  1.55  Fe  0.45  )Si  2  O  10  &#183;xH  2  O and exhibiting the structure of the previously reported Rb  2  (Nb  2  O  4  )(Si  2  O  6  )&#183;H  2  O have been synthesized under mild hydrothermal conditions. Replacement of the bulky Rb  +  by smaller Na  +  ions was accomplished by stabilizing the framework structure via partial occupancy of the Nb  5+  sites by Fe  3+  ions. Exploratory ion&#8208;exchange assays evidence the considerable potential of this new silicate to remove rare&#8208;earth elements from aqueous solutions.</dc:description>
