         <title>Advance and Designing Strategies in Polymeric Antifungal Agents Inspired by Membrane&#8208;Active Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 65, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The growing prevalence of invasive fungal diseases, the scarcity of existing antifungal drugs, and the continued emergence of antifungal drug resistance urge the development of new antifungal agents. This concept discusses and highlights the advance and designing strategies of antifungal polymeric agents with a focus on design principles inspired by membrane&#8208;active peptides, including host defense peptides and cell&#8208;penetrating peptides.







Abstract
The high&#8208;mortality invasive fungal infections seriously threaten the lives of immunocompromised people. Host defense peptides and cell&#8208;penetrating peptides are representative membrane&#8208;active peptides with different functions. Among them, host defense peptides mimicking is a valid strategy in the design of synthetic antifungal agents. Despite the brilliance in the field of intracellular delivery, the potential of cell&#8208;penetrating peptides and their mimics for designing antifungal agents has been overlooked. In this concept article, we describe the structural design of synthetic antifungal polymers as mimics of host defense peptides, and highlight the effectiveness and potential of cell&#8208;penetrating peptide&#8208;inspired strategy in designing potent and selective antifungal polymeric agents. In addition, an outlook for further expanding the design horizons of antifungal polymers is also presented.

         <title>The Unprecedented [S4N2O10]2&#8722; Anion in the Molecular Gold Complexes [Au2Br2(S4N2O10)2] and [Au2Cl2(S4N2O10)2](S2O5Cl2)</title>

         <dc:description>
The cyclic anionic tetramer, [S4N2O10]2&#8722;, is reported in dimeric gold complexes for the first time. The anion can be interpreted as the condensation product of two sulfate anions and two amidosulfate anions. The applied solvothermal synthesis between SO3, P3N3Cl6 and metal salts is a promising route to obtain novel nitrogen&#8208;containing sulfates.







Abstract
The reaction of hexachlorophosphazene, P3N3Cl6, with SO3 and the gold halides AuCl3 and AuBr3, respectively, leads to the new cyclic anionic tetramer, [S4N2O10]2&#8722;, which is coordinated to Au3+ in the dimeric complexes [Au2X2(S4N2O10)2] (X=Cl, Br). The [S4N2O10]2&#8722; anion can be seen as the condensation product of two sulfate anions, [SO4]2&#8722;, and two amidosulfate anions, [NH2SO3]&#8722;.

         <title>Oxidation of an Internal&#8208;Edge&#8208;Substituted [5]Helicene&#8208;Derived Phosphine Synchronously Enhances Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 65, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Laterally &#960;&#8208;extended 7,8&#8208;dihydro[5]helicenes bearing phosphine and phosphine oxide groups on their inner helical rims were synthesized, and their photophysical and chiroptical properties were analyzed. As expected, the phosphine oxide showed a markedly enhanced circularly polarized luminescence response compared with that of the corresponding phosphine.







Abstract
Small chiral organic molecules with CD properties are in high demanded due to their potential use in promising electronic and biological applications. Herein, we reveal a system in which the oxidation of a phosphino group to the corresponding phosphine oxide on the inner rim of a helicene derivative induces a CPL response. Laterally &#960;&#8208;extended 7,8&#8208;dihydro[5]helicenes bearing phosphine and phosphine oxide groups on their inner helical rims (i.&#8201;e., the C1 position) were synthesized, and their helical structures were unambiguously determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The photophysical (UV/visible and emission) and chiroptical properties of these compounds were investigated in various solvents. Despite their structural similarities, phosphine oxide showed a significantly better CPL response than phosphine, with a high dissymmetry factor for emission (|glum|=(1.3&#8211;1.9)&#215;10&#8722;3) that can be attributed to structural changes in the interior of the helicene helix.

         <title>Thioxanthylium Cations: Highly Reversible Hydrochromic Mate&#8208;rials with Tunable Color and Moisture Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 65, November 21, 2022. </description>

Hydrochromism of thioxanthylium cations/ thioxanthene&#8208;9&#8208;ol can be tuned by structural functionalization to offer diverse colors and moisture&#8208;sensitivities. This reversible hydrochromic system is easily activated with organic acid from chemically stable precursors, allowing for possible uses in moisture&#8208;sensing and anti&#8208;counterfeiting encryption.







Abstract
Hydrochromic materials, which change color in response to moisture, are highly sought&#8208;after due to some unique applications such as moisture detection, humidity monitoring, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and sweat&#8208;pore mapping. We herein report a new thioxanthene&#8208;9&#8208;ols/thioxanthylium cations hydrochromic system. The hydrochromic thioxanthylium cations can be generated/regenerated by exposing a chemically stable thioxanthene&#8208;9&#8208;ol to trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The intensely colored thioxanthylium cations can be chemically reverted to the colorless thioxanthene&#8208;9&#8208;ol. Interestingly, the conversion between thioxanthene&#8208;9&#8208;ol and its cation species was found to be highly reversible in most cases (up to 50 activation&#8208;deactivation cycles). The color and moisture&#8208;sensitivity of thioxanthylium cations were also validated to be tunable via functionalization of the thioxanthene core with different aliphatic and aromatic groups at its 9 or 2,7&#8208;positions. Finally, paper probes were prepared using solution&#8208;immersion and inkjet&#8208;printing techniques to demonstrate the system's potential applications in humidity sensing and anti&#8208;counterfeiting

         <title>YfeX &#8211; A New Platform for Carbene Transferase Development with High Intrinsic Reactivity</title>

YfeX, naturally a peroxidase, has great potential for the development of new carbene transferases. WT YfeX catalyzes N&#8722;H insertion (including aliphatic and secondary amines) in high yield, cyclopropanation, and most excitingly, Si&#8722;H insertion of dimethylphenylsilane. QM/MM calculations reveal details of the mechanism of the unusual Si&#8722;H insertion reaction.







Abstract
Carbene transfer biocatalysis has evolved from basic science to an area with vast potential for the development of new industrial processes. In this study, we show that YfeX, naturally a peroxidase, has great potential for the development of new carbene transferases, due to its high intrinsic reactivity, especially for the N&#8722;H insertion reaction of aromatic and aliphatic primary and secondary amines. YfeX shows high stability against organic solvents (methanol and DMSO), greatly improving turnover of hydrophobic substrates. Interestingly, in styrene cyclopropanation, WT YfeX naturally shows high enantioselectivity, generating the trans product with 87&#8201;% selectivity for the (R,R) enantiomer. WT YfeX also catalyzes the Si&#8722;H insertion efficiently. Steric effects in the active site were further explored using the R232A variant. Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) calculations reveal details on the mechanism of Si&#8722;H insertion. YfeX, and potentially other peroxidases, are exciting new targets for the development of improved carbene transferases.

         <title>&#8220;Crystal memory&#8221; Affects the Properties of Peptide Hydrogels &#8211; The Case of the Cyclic Tyr&#8208;Tyr dipeptide</title>

Peptide self&#8208;assembling: Both, solid&#8208;state form and stereochemistry significantly influence a self&#8208;assembly process of a cyclic dipeptide, Tyr&#8208;Tyr (cYY), leading to a soft matter with different morphology and rheological properties.







Abstract
In this work a relationship between the crystal form and morphology and rheological properties of peptide&#8208;based hydrogels is examined. We show, that under favorable circumstances a correlation between a starting solid material and a self&#8208;assembly processes in solution can exist, leading to different properties of a resulting soft matter. This observation, together with an in&#8208;depth analysis of the influence of stereochemistry of self&#8208;assembled (ll) and (dl) Tyr&#8208;Tyr cyclic dipeptides (cYY) on the observed relationship between gelation and crystallization allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the peptide hydrogelation processes at a molecular level, using liquid state NMR, rheological studies and scanning electron microscopy. In the course of our studies, several crystal forms of (ll)&#8208;cYY has been discovered and described in details using single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, as well as advanced solid state NMR, X&#8208;ray diffraction of powders, thermal analysis, FTIR, circular dichroism and crystal structure prediction (CSP) calculations. Subsequently, we found that while (ll)&#8208;cYY easily assembles into hydrogels with different properties depending on the starting solid form, (dl)&#8208;cYY always precipitated as one crystal form in the tested conditions. Molecular&#8208;level justification for this observation is given.

         <title>C&#8722;H Activation of Inert Arenes using a Photochemically Activated Guanidinato&#8208;Magnesium(I) Compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 65, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical approach. Activations of arene C&#8722;H bonds by a photochemically excited dimagnesium(I) compound are reported (see picture, Dip=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl). Experimental and theoretical evidence for the intermediacy of magnesium radicals in these reactions is presented. Such transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C&#8722;H bond activations hold considerable potential for organic synthesis.







Abstract
UV irradiation of solutions of a guanidinate coordinated dimagnesium(I) compound, [{(Priso)Mg}2] 3 (Priso=[(DipN)2CNPri2]&#8722;, Dip=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl), in either benzene, toluene, the three isomers of xylene, or mesitylene, leads to facile activation of an aromatic C&#8722;H bond of the solvent in all cases, and formation of aryl/hydride bridged magnesium(II) products, [{(Priso)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;H)(&#956;&#8208;Ar)] 4&#8211;9. In contrast to similar reactions reported for &#946;&#8208;diketiminate coordinated counterparts of 3, these C&#8722;H activations proceed with little regioselectivity, though they are considerably faster. Reaction of 3 with an excess of the pyridine, p&#8208;NC5H4But (pyBut), gave [(Priso)Mg(pyButH)(pyBut)2] 10, presumably via reduction of the pyridine to yield a radical intermediate, [(Priso)Mg(pyBut&#8901;)(pyBut)2] 11, which then abstracts a proton from the reaction solvent or a reactant. DFT calculations suggest two possible pathways to the observed arene C&#8722;H activations. One of these involves photochemical cleavage of the Mg&#8722;Mg bond of 3, generating magnesium(I) doublet radicals, (Priso)Mg&#8901;. These then doubly reduce the arene substrate to give &#8220;Birch&#8208;like&#8221; products, which subsequently rearrange via C&#8722;H activation of the arene. Circumstantial evidence for the photochemical generation of transient magnesium radical species includes the fact that irradiation of a cyclohexane solution of 3 leads to an intramolecular aliphatic C&#8722;H activation process and formation of an alkyl&#8208;bridged magnesium(II) species, [{Mg(&#956;&#8208;Priso&#8722;H)}2] 12. Furthermore, irradiation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of 3 and the &#946;&#8208;diketiminato dimagnesium(I) compound, [{(DipNacnac)Mg}2] (DipNacnac=[HC(MeCNDip)2]&#8722;), effects a &#8220;scrambling&#8221; reaction, and the near quantitative formation of an unsymmetrical dimagnesium(I) compound, [(Priso)Mg&#8722;Mg(DipNacnac)] 13. Finally, the EPR spectrum (77&#8197;K) of a glassed solution of UV irradiated 3 is dominated by a broad featureless signal, indicating the presence of a doublet radical species.

         <title>Thiazole Boron Difluoride Dyes with Large Stokes Shift, Solid State Emission and Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 65, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Five&#8208;membered boron difluoro complexes using a secondary amide as an anionic ligand display large Stokes shift and significant solid&#8208;state emission. Dyes exhibiting room&#8208; temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emission in both amorphous and crystalline states are documented.







Abstract
The small Stokes shift and weak emission in the solid state are two main shortcomings associated with the boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) family of dyes. This study presents the design, synthesis and luminescent properties of boron difluoro complexes of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;5&#8208;alkylamino&#8208;4&#8208;alkylaminocarbonylthiazoles. These dyes display Stokes shifts (&#916;&#955;, 77&#8211;101&#8197;nm) with quantum yields (&#981;FL) up to 64.9 and 34.7&#8201;% in toluene solution and in solid state, respectively. Some of these compounds exhibit dual fluorescence and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emission properties with modulable phosphorescence quantum yields (&#981;PL) and lifetime (&#964;p up to 251&#8197;&#956;s). The presence of intramolecular H&#8208;bonds and negligible &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking revealed by X&#8208;ray crystal structure might account for the observed large Stokes shift and significant solid&#8208;state emission of these fluorophores, while the enhanced spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) of iodine and the self&#8208;assembly driven by halogen bonding, &#960;&#8208;&#960; and C&#8722;H&#8230;&#960; interactions could be responsible for the observed RTP of iodine containing phosphors.

&lt;sub&gt;FL&lt;/sub&gt;) up to 64.9 and 34.7&#8201;% in toluene solution and in solid state, respectively. Some of these compounds exhibit dual fluorescence and room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emission properties with modulable phosphorescence quantum yields (&lt;i&gt;&#981;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;PL&lt;/sub&gt;) and lifetime (&#964;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; up to 251&#8197;&#956;s). The presence of intramolecular H-bonds and negligible &#960;-&#960; stacking revealed by X-ray crystal structure might account for the observed large Stokes shift and significant solid-state emission of these fluorophores, while the enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of iodine and the self-assembly driven by halogen bonding, &#960;-&#960; and C&#8722;H&lt;sup&gt;&#8230;&lt;/sup&gt;&#960; interactions could be responsible for the observed RTP of iodine containing phosphors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Cyclization of 1,6&#8208;Enynes through Intramolecular Chlorine Transfer as a Novel Strategy for Asymmetric Halopalladation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 65, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intramolecular chlorine transfer strategy for enantioselective halopalladation cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes has been established to build versatile and functionally diverse &#945;&#8208;chloromethylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones in excellent E selectivity and enantioselectivity with good functional&#8208;group compatibility. This strategy provides a novel approach to asymmetric halopalladation and an alternative for synthesizing complex natural products.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cyclization of enynes has contributed significantly to the construction of chiral cyclic molecules. In contrast, the catalytic asymmetric cyclization involving halopalladation remains an unresolved challenge with the inevitable disturbance of the halide ions. Herein, an intramolecular chlorine transfer strategy is used to accomplish the enantioselective chloropalladation cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes. This reaction provides a redox&#8208;neutral approach to a variety of chiral &#945;&#8208;chloromethylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones with excellent E selectivity and enantioselectivity. The precisely controlled coordination of palladium with both the in&#8197;situ generated nucleophilic species and the monodentate phosphoramidite ligand is crucial for enantioselectivity.

Binding: This study aims to add a deeper level of knowledge to the binding interactions between G4&#8208;ligands and G4 DNA to advance the design of improved G4&#8208;ligands. This is achieved by biophysical and physicochemical evaluations complemented by computational studies of both novel and well&#8208;known G4&#8208;ligands.







Abstract
This study aims to deepen the knowledge of the current state of rational G4&#8208;ligand design through the design and synthesis of a novel set of compounds based on indoles, quinolines, and benzofurans and their comparisons with well&#8208;known G4&#8208;ligands. This resulted in novel synthetic methods and G4&#8208;ligands that bind and stabilize G4 DNA with high selectivity. Furthermore, the study corroborates previous studies on the design of G4&#8208;ligands and adds deeper explanations to why a) macrocycles offer advantages in terms of G4&#8208;binding and &#8208;selectivity, b) molecular pre&#8208;organization is of key importance in the development of strong novel binders, c) an electron&#8208;deficient aromatic core is essential to engage in strong arene&#8208;arene interactions with the G4&#8208;surface, and d) aliphatic amines can strengthen interactions indirectly through changing the arene electrostatic nature of the compound. Finally, fundamental physicochemical properties of selected G4&#8208;binders are evaluated, underscoring the complexity of aligning the properties required for efficient G4 binding and stabilization with feasible pharmacokinetic properties.

         <title>Leveraging Metal and Ligand Reactive Sites for One Pot Reactions: Ligand&#8208;Centered Borenium Ions for Tandem Catalysis with Palladium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 65, November 21, 2022. </description>

Pd complexes with triaminoborane&#8208;containing diphosphorous ligands are reported that are capable of tandem cycloaddition and cross&#8208;coupling catalysis using separate reactive sites on the metal and ligand.







Abstract
Tandem catalysts that perform two different organic transformations in a single pot are highly desirable because they enable rapid and efficient assembly of simple organic building blocks into more complex molecules. Many examples of tandem catalysis rely on metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions involving one or more metal complexes. Remarkably, despite surging interest in the development of chemically reactive (i.&#8201;e., non&#8208;innocent) ligands, there are few examples of metal complexes that leverage ligand&#8208;centered reactivity to perform catalytic reactions in tandem with separate catalytic reactions at the metal. Here we report how multifunctional Pd complexes with triaminoborane&#8208;derived diphosphorus ligands, called TBDPhos, appear to facilitate borenium&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition reactions at the ligand, and Pd&#8208;catalyzed Stille and Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reactions at the metal. Both transformations can be accessed in one pot to afford rare examples of tandem catalysis using separate metal and ligand catalysis sites in a single complex.

         <title>Influence of the Coordinated Transition Metal Ion on Magnetic Relaxation of Lanthanide Based Complexes with Imino Nitroxide Biradical Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 65, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two series of biradical&#8208;metal complexes have been obtained by using an imino nitroxide biradical. Remarkably one magnetic process is found for the Dy&#8208;biradical compound while the Dy&#8722;Cu&#8208;radical compound exhibits dual relaxation processes which indicates that the second coordination sphere of Dy ion plays a crucial role in magnetic relaxation behavior.







Abstract
In spite of achievement of a lot of Ln&#8208;radical SMMs, how to improve magnetic behavior of Ln&#8208;radical system remains challenging. Here, two series of Ln&#8208;radical complexes have successfully been built using an imino nitroxide biradical, namely, [Ln2(hfac)6(ImPhPyobis)2] (LnIII=Gd 1, Tb 2, Dy 3) and [Ln2Cu2(hfac)10(ImPhPyobis)2] (LnIII=Gd 4, Dy 5; hfac=hexafluoroacetylacetonate and ImPhPyobis=5&#8208;(4&#8208;oxypyridinium&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(1&#8217;&#8208;oxyl&#8208;4&#8217;,4&#8217;,5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;hydro&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene). For these biradical&#8208;metal complexes, two imino nitroxide biradicals bind two Ln(III) ions via their oxygen atoms coming from 4&#8208;oxypyridinium units to produce a binuclear {Ln2O2} unit. Those imino nitroxide groups are free for complexes 1&#8211;3, however one of imino nitroxide groups of the biradical is ligated to the copper(II) ion for complexes 4 and 5. The distinct magnetic relaxation behaviors are observed for two Dy derivatives, as revealed by ac magnetic studies: complex 3 presents one magnetic process with the effective energy barrier(Ueff) of 74.0&#8197;K while complex 5 exhibits dual relaxation processes with Ueff values for the fast&#8208; and slow&#8208;relaxation being 20.2&#8197;K and 30.9&#8197;K, respectively, which implies that the second coordination sphere of Dy ion plays a critical role for magnetic relaxation.

         <title>Design of a Photocatalytic [2+2] Cycloaddition Reaction Using Redox&#8208;Tag Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 65, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new photocatalytic [2+2] cycloaddition reaction based on our Redox&#8208;Tag strategy was developed involving carefully designed substrates which turned out to be effective for the reaction. A radical cation was formed by oxidative single electron transfer (SET) that immediately reacted with an alkene. An aryl radical cation was generated by intramolecular SET and during the subsequent reductive SET a cyclobutane was formed.







Abstract
The design of photocatalytic processes is important for a sustainable society. Key to these photocatalytic reactions is electron transfer. This article is focused on titanium dioxide photocatalyzed organic synthesis and the design of a new [2+2] cycloaddition reaction based on the electron transfer process. Electron transfer &#8208; not only between the substrate and the photocatalyst but also inter&#8208; and intramolecularly &#8211; is crucial for the reaction design. Radical cations were generated by the photocatalyst and trapped by alkenes. The resultant cyclobutyl radical cations were immediately reduced by the aryl rings via intramolecular electron transfer to obtain cyclobutane rings. The outcome of the reaction was controlled by substitution of the aryl ring and the linker connecting the aryl ring to the enol ether. The carefully designed substrates were highly effective for photocatalytic cycloaddition.

         <title>Terpyridine Diphosphine Ruthenium Complexes as Efficient Photocatalysts for the Transfer Hydrogenation of Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 65, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new cationic ruthenium [RuCl(PP)(tpy)]X (X=Cl, PF6) complexes, prepared from [RuCl2(PPh3)3] a diphosphine and 2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine (tpy), promote the photocatalytical transfer hydrogenation (TH) of carbonyl compounds in 2&#8208;propanol under mild conditions. Unprecedented asymmetric catalytic TH of acetophenone driven by light was obtained with ruthenium tpy complexes containing the chiral Skewphos diphosphine.







Abstract
The cationic achiral and chiral terpyridine diphosphine ruthenium complexes [RuCl(PP)(tpy)]Cl (PP=dppp (1), (R,R)&#8208;Skewphos (2) and (S,S)&#8208;Skewphos (3)) are easily obtained in 85&#8211;88&#8201;% yield through a one&#8208;pot synthesis from [RuCl2(PPh3)3], the diphosphine and 2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine (tpy) in 1&#8208;butanol. Treatment of 1&#8211;3 with NaPF6 in methanol at RT affords quantitatively the corresponding derivatives [RuCl(PP)(tpy)]PF6 (PP=dppp (1&#8201;a), (R,R)&#8208;Skewphos (2&#8201;a) and (S,S)&#8208;Skewphos (3&#8201;a)). Reaction of [RuCl2(PPh3)3] with (S,R)&#8208;Josiphos or (R)&#8208;BINAP in toluene, followed by treatment with tpy in 1&#8208;butanol and finally with NaPF6 in MeOH gives [RuCl(PP)(tpy)]PF6 (PP=(S,R)&#8208;Josiphos (4&#8201;a), (R)&#8208;BINAP (5&#8201;a)) isolated in 78&#8201;% and 86&#8201;% yield, respectively. The chiral derivatives have been isolated as single stereoisomers and 3&#8201;a, 4&#8201;a have been characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. The tpy complexes with NaOiPr display high photocatalytic activity in the transfer hydrogenation (TH) of carbonyl compounds using 2&#8208;propanol as the only hydrogen donor and visible light at 30&#8201;&#176;C, at remarkably high S/C (up to 5000) and TOF values up to 264&#8197;h&#8722;1. The chiral enantiomers 2, 2&#8201;a and 3, 3&#8201;a induce the asymmetric photocatalytic TH of acetophenone, affording (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol with 51 and 52&#8201;% ee, respectively, in a MeOH/2&#8208;propanol mixture.

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Oligothiophenes Incorporating Photochromic Torsional Switches</title>

Twist it! A light&#8208;responsive molecular design to tune the &#960;&#8208;conjugation extension of oligothiophenes has been established. The relationship between molecular structure and optoelectronic properties was comprehensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. The results highlight the functionality of the proposed molecular architecture as a promising candidate for the development of novel light&#8208;responsive optoelectronic technologies.







Abstract
We present a quaterthiophene and sexithiophene that can reversibly change their effective &#960;&#8208;conjugation length through photoexcitation. The reported compounds make use of light&#8208;responsive molecular actuators consisting of an azobenzene attached to a bithiophene unit by both direct and linker&#8208;assisted bonding. Upon exposure to 350&#8197;nm light, the azobenzene undergoes trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis isomerization, thus mechanically inducing the oligothiophene to assume a planar conformation (extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation). Exposure to 254&#8197;nm wavelength promotes azobenzene cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans isomerization, forcing the thiophenic backbones to twist out of planarity (confined &#960;&#8208;conjugation). Twisted conformations are also reached by cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans thermal relaxation at a rate that increases proportionally with the conjugation length of the oligothiophene moiety. The molecular conformations of quaterthiophene and sexithiophene were characterized by using steady&#8208;state UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography and quantum&#8208;chemical modeling. Finally, we tested the proposed light&#8208;responsive oligothiophenes in field&#8208;effect transistors to probe the photo&#8208;induced tuning of their electronic properties.

         <title>Intrinsic Regularity of Catalytic Cobalt Chalcogenides in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Battery: Theoretical Study Delivers New Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 65, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Theoretical study delivers new insights into catalytic cobalt chalcogenides CoX2 (X=S, Se, Te) in lithium&#8208;sulfur battery. The polysulfides adsorption is mainly controled by relative vertical distance of two X atomic layers (rather than atom electronegativity). The charging process (rather than discharging process) is mainly regulated to contribute to steady polysulfides conversion.







Abstract
Cobalt chalcogenides CoX2 (X=S, Se, Te) render great performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries based on catalytic capacity to alleviate shuttle effect. Given that S/Se/Te belong to the same main group, the outstanding cycling stability delivered by CoTe2 aroused the curiosity about the uniqueness of CoTe2 and intrinsic laws of cobalt chalcogenide. Herein, comprehensive theoretical study delivers new insights into the intrinsic laws of CoX2: the relative vertical distance of two X atomic layers (rather than atom electronegativity) mainly controls adsorption; CoX2 mainly regulates the charging process (rather than discharging process) thus contributes to great cycling stability. On this basis, the advantages of CoTe2 are three&#8208;fold: moderate polysulfide adsorption, facile ion transport capacity, and surprisingly great promotion of charging process. It is hope the results will facilitate the development of cobalt chalcogenides, especially tellurides as catalytic material in lithium sulfur batteries.

Herein, comprehensive theoretical study delivers new insights into the intrinsic laws of CoX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: the relative vertical distance of two X atomic layers (rather than atom electronegativity) mainly controls adsorption; CoX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mainly regulates the charging process (rather than discharging process) thus contributes to great cycling stability. On this basis, the advantages of CoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are three-fold: moderate polysulfide adsorption, facile ion transport capacity, and surprisingly great promotion of charging process. It is hope the results will facilitate the development of cobalt chalcogenides, especially tellurides as catalytic material in lithium sulfur batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dimorpholinoacetylene and Its Use for the Synthesis of Tetraaminocyclobutadiene Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 65, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dimorpholinoacetylene has been synthesized and structurally characterized as a new member of the class of electron&#8208;rich diaminoacetylenes. The new compound can be used to produce cyclic bent allene (CBA) transition&#8208;metal complexes or oxidized to give the first fully characterized cyclobutadiene dication. Detailed computational studies by NICS and current density calculations were carried out to assess the aromaticity of tetraaminocyclobutadiene dications.







Abstract
The new diaminoacetylene (DAA) dimorpholinoacetylene (3) was prepared from 1,1&#8208;dimorpholinoethene (1) by bromination to form the dibromoketene aminal 2, which upon lithiation afforded 3 through a Fritsch&#8208;Buttenberg&#8208;Wiechell rearrangement. Heating 3 at elevated temperatures resulted in a complete conversion into the dimer 1,1,2,4&#8208;tetramorpholino&#8208;1&#8208;buten&#8208;3&#8208;yne (4), which was used for the synthesis of four&#8208;membered cyclic bent allene (CBA) transition&#8208;metal complexes of the type [(CBA)MLn] (5&#8208;7; MLn=AuCl, RhCl(COD), RhCl(CO)2; CBA=1,3,4,4&#8208;tetramorpholino&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclobutadiene; COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene). The reaction of 3 with tetraethylammonium bromide gave 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetramorpholinocyclobutenylium bromide (8), which reacted with bromine to form 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetra(morpholino)cyclobutenediylium bis(tribromide) (9). Compound 9 represents the first fully characterized compound containing a tetraaminocyclobutadiene dication and displays a nearly planar C4N4 core as shown by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Detailed quantum chemical calculations were performed to assess the aromaticity of tetraaminocyclubutadiene dications by employing the Nucleus Independent Chemical Shift (NICS) method and current density analysis.

         <title>Structural Insights into the Very Low Activity of the Homocoenzyme B12 Adenosylmethylcobalamin in Coenzyme B12&#8208;Dependent Diol Dehydratase and Ethanolamine Ammonia&#8208;Lyase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 65, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
X&#8208;ray structures of diol dehydratase (DD) and ethanolamine ammonia&#8208;lyase (EAL) complexed with adenosylmethylcobalamin (AdoMeCbl) were determined to get insights into the very low activity of AdoMeCbl. The DD active site is flexible, and AdoMeCbl binding causes large conformational changes that leave DD in the inactive state (left). The EAL active site is rigid and its binding does not induce significant conformational change (right).







Abstract
The X&#8208;ray structures of coenzyme B12 (AdoCbl)&#8208;dependent eliminating isomerases complexed with adenosylmethylcobalamin (AdoMeCbl) have been determined. As judged from geometries, the Co&#8722;C bond in diol dehydratase (DD) is not activated even in the presence of substrate. In ethanolamine ammonia&#8208;lyase (EAL), the bond is elongated in the absence of substrate; in the presence of substrate, the complex likely exists in both pre&#8208; and post&#8208;homolysis states. The impacts of incorporating an extra CH2 group are different in the two enzymes: the DD active site is flexible, and AdoMeCbl binding causes large conformational changes that make DD unable to adopt the catalytic state, whereas the EAL active site is rigid, and AdoMeCbl binding does not induce significant conformational changes. Such flexibility and rigidity of the active sites might reflect the tightness of adenine binding. The structures provide good insights into the basis of the very low activity of AdoMeCbl in these enzymes.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of 3&#8208;Aryl Substituted Isocoumarins and Phthalides through Palladium Acetate Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H Activation in Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 65, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, high&#8208;throughput synthesis of isocoumarins and phthalides is presented. The reaction is carried out in molten tetrabutylammonium acetate (ionic liquid) which allows the use of an amount of palladium acetate from ten to twenty times lower than that of similar protocols in molecular solvents (0.5&#8201;% mol). Oxygen is used as a reoxidant for the metal, mediated by copper acetate.







Abstract
A novel Pd&#8208;catalysed oxidative coupling between benzoic acids and vinylarenes or acrylates to furnish isocoumarins and phthalides is reported. The reaction proceeds smoothly in molten tetrabutylammonium acetate via a selective C&#8722;H bond activation, with very low percentage of ligand&#8208;free palladium acetate as the catalyst, under atmospheric pressure of oxygen. Sub&#8208;stoichiometric amount of copper acetate is also required as a reoxidant for the palladium.

         <title>Microscopic Reactivity of Phenylferrate Ions toward Organyl Halides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 65, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The gas&#8208;phase reactivity of phenylferrate ions toward organyl halides is studied by a combination of tandem mass spectrometry and DFT calculations. The thus obtained results offer a sharp glimpse at the elementary step of the oxidative addition and help to improve our fundamental understanding of iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions.







Abstract
Despite its practical importance, organoiron chemistry remains poorly understood due to its mechanistic complexity. Here, we focus on the oxidative addition of organyl halides to phenylferrate anions in the gas phase. By mass&#8208;selecting individual phenylferrate anions, we can determine the effect of the oxidation state, the ligation, and the nuclearity of the iron complex on its reactions with a series of organyl halides RX. We find that Ph2Fe(I)&#8722; and other low&#8208;valent ferrates are more reactive than Ph3Fe(II)&#8722;; Ph4Fe(III)&#8722; is inert. The coordination of a PPh3 ligand or the presence of a second iron center lower the reactivity. Besides direct cross&#8208;coupling reactions resulting in the formation of RPh, we also observe the abstraction of halogen atoms. This reaction channel shows the readiness of organoiron species to undergo radical&#8208;type processes. Complementary DFT calculations afford further insight and rationalize the high reactivity of the Ph2Fe(I)&#8722; complex by the exothermicity of the oxidative addition and the low barriers associated with this reaction step. At the same time, they point to the importance of changes of the spin state in the reactions of Ph3Fe(II)&#8722;.

         <title>The Sulfur Rich Fluorothiophosphate Dianions [S5P2F2]2&#8722; and [S3PF]2&#8722; : Cluster and Chelation Control of P&#8208;S Heterolysis</title>

Coordination of difluoropentathiophosphate to d10 metals results in either simple bis&#8208;chelate coordination or P&#8722;S heterolysis and capping of fluorotrithiophosphate in trinuclear and octanuclear cadmium and copper clusters. These new complexes may see use as metallothionein mimicks or in capping of CdS semiconductors.







Abstract
The sulfur rich difluoropentathiodiphosphate dianion [S5P2F2]2&#8722;, from fluoride addition to P4S10, has a somewhat checkered history and proves to be the main product of the reaction in acetonitrile. Its optimized synthesis, and structural characterization, as either a tetraphenylphosphonium or a tetrapropylammonium salt, [NnPr4]2[S5P2F2] allows for the first coordination chemistry for this dianion. Reactions of [S5P2F2]2&#8722; with d10 metal ions of zinc(II), and cadmium(II), and d9 copper(II) resulted in a surprising diverse array of binding modes and structural motifs. In addition to the simple bis&#8208;chelate coordination of [S5P2F2]2&#8722; with zinc, cleavage of the P&#8722;S bond resulted in complexes with the unusual [S3PF]2&#8722; fluorotrithiophosphate dianion. This was observed in two cluster complexes: a trinuclear cadmium complex with mixed [S5P2F2]2&#8722;/[S3PF]2&#8722; ligands, [Cd3(S5P2F2)3(S3PF)2]4&#8722; as well as an octanuclear copper cluster, [Cu8(S3PF)6]4&#8722; which form rapidly at room temperature. These new metal/sulfur/ligand clusters are of relevance to understanding multimetal binding to metallothionines, and to potential capping strategies for the condensed nanoparticulate cadmium chalcogenide semiconductors CdS and CdSe.

         <title>Cover Feature: Light&#8208;Responsive Oligothiophenes Incorporating Photochromic Torsional Switches (Chem. Eur. J. 65/2022)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 65, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of light&#8208;responsive &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds incorporates photochromic torsional switches (PTS). These compounds are able to tune the planarization of their &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone, and thus their optical and electronic properties, by using light as an external stimulus. The PTS unit is based on a bithiophene fragment linked to a photochromic azobenzene moiety. When this PTS&#8208;containing oligothiophene is not exposed to light, the azobenzene moiety assumes its extended trans conformation, which forces the oligothiophene backbone to twist out of coplanarity. Exposure to UV light results in isomerization to the cis conformation, which allows the bithiophene fragment to assume a planar, &#960;&#8208;conjugated conformation. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Fazzi, E. Orentas, G. Sforazzini, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202698).

Helicenes with controllable chiroptical properties: Herein, we reveal a system in which the oxidation of a phosphino group on the inner rim of a helicene derivative induces a circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) response. A helicene bearing a phosphine oxide group exhibits a markedly enhanced CPL response in the excited state compared with that of such a helicene with a corresponding phosphine. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Usui, Y. Imai, S. Karasawa, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202922).

Multiple heterohelicenes involving one or more heteroatoms in the helical backbone, in light of the importance of their spanning disciplines of the chemical and material sciences, have thus attracted significant interest from various research fields. This review summarizes the current progress in the chemistry of multiple heterohelicenes, especially of those with boron, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, sulfur, or phosphorus atoms fused into their skeletons over the past decade (2012&#8211;2022). For each of multiple heterohelicenes, their synthesis, structural features, electronic and chiroptical properties, as well as examples of their applications, are collected (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201966).

         <title>Cover Feature: Dimorpholinoacetylene and Its Use for the Synthesis of Tetraaminocyclobutadiene Species (Chem. Eur. J. 65/2022)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 65, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable cyclobutadiene dication was isolated and structurally characterized as a bis(tribromide) salt. Unlike the folded minimum structure calculated for the parent C4H42+ system, this dication exhibits a planar geometry in the solid state. However, calculations reveal a nearly isoenergetic folded isomer, and detailed studies employing advanced NICS methods show that, counterintuitively, cyclobutadiene dications are more aromatic when puckered rather than planar. For more information on this topic and related applications of diaminoacetylenes, see the Research Article by M. Tamm and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202737).

Multiple heterohelicenes represent an important class of materials for chiral optical and electronic devices. This review provides a summary of the recent advances in the precision synthesis and characterization of multiple heterohelicenes, as well as an outlook on multiple heterohelicene chemistry and the further molecular design of highly multiplexed heterohelicenes.







Abstract
Multiple heterohelicenes are a unique class of helical nonplanar scaffolds that have attracted great attention due to their appealing shapes, optical and electronic properties, and potential applications in chiral materials. This review describes the recent advances and challenges in the design and synthesis of representative multiple heterohelicenes with intriguing chiral properties. And the corresponding applications are also covered.

         <title>Detection of Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species by Upconversion Nanoparticle&#8208;Based Near&#8208;Infrared Nanoprobes: Recent Progress and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 65, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accurate detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) is of great significance. A variety of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs)&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared (NIR) nanoprobes for ROS and RNS detection is reviewed. Our focus is to describe how they are built and how do they work. Finally, the future opportunities and challenges for UCNPs&#8208;based NIR nanoprobes are briefly discussed, and how to improve the performance of UCNPs is also prospected.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are essential oxidative metabolites of organisms, which are closely related to physiological, pathological and pharmacological processes. The accurate detection of ROS/RNS is important for the understanding of biological processes, monitoring of pharmacological effects, and predicting the course of disease. The recently developed NIR nanoprobes based on upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) hold great prospects in sensitive and deep&#8208;tissue detection of ROS/RNS, and considerable progress has been achieved so far. In this review, we systematically summarize the up&#8208;to&#8208;date advances of UCNPs&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared (NIR) probes for ROS/RNS sensing, and the potential challenges and perspectives for further research are also highlighted. We envision that such a research field will have a bright future for modern biomedical applications.

         <title>Concertedness and Activation Energy Control by Distal Methyl Group during Ring Contraction/Expansion in Scalarane&#8208;type Sesterterpenoid Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Salmahyritisol A, similan A, and hippospongide A, which are scalarane&#8208;type sesterterpenoids, feature 6/6/5/7/5 pentacyclic skeletons. Although their biosyntheses have been previously proposed to involve a unique skeletal rearrangement reaction, the detailed reaction mechanism remains unclear as none of the corresponding biosynthetic enzymes for this reaction have been reported. Herein, we investigated this skeletal rearrangement reaction using computational techniques, which revealed the following four key features: (i) the distal 24&#8208;Me substituent controls both the concertedness and activation energy of this transformation, (ii) enzymes are not responsible for the observed regioselectivity of C12&#8211;C20 bond formation, (iii) stereoselectivity is enzyme&#8208;regulated, and (iv) protonation is a key step in this skeletal rearrangement process. These new findings provide insight into the C&#8208;ring&#8208;contraction and D&#8208;ring&#8208;expansion mechanisms in scalarane&#8208;type sesterterpenoid biosyntheses.</dc:description>

         <title>Resolving the Chemical Formula of Nesquehonite via&#160;NMR Crystallography, DFT Computation, and Complementary Neutron Diffraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nesquehonite is a magnesium carbonate mineral relevant to carbon sequestration envisioned for carbon capture and storage of CO2. Its chemical formula remains controversial today, assigned as either a hydrated magnesium carbonate [MgCO3&#8226;3H2O], or a hydroxy &#8208; hydrated &#8208; magnesium bicarbonate [Mg(HCO3)OH&#8226;2H2O]. The resolution of this controversy is central to understanding this material's thermodynamic, phase, and chemical behavior. We present an NMR crystallography study, using rotational&#8208;echo double&#8208;resonance 13C{1H} (REDOR) to determine 13C &#8208; 1H distances with precision, and the combination of 13C static NMR lineshapes and density &#8208; functional theory (DFT) calculations to model different H atomic coordinates.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nesquehonite is a magnesium carbonate mineral relevant to carbon sequestration envisioned for carbon capture and storage of CO2. Its chemical formula remains controversial today, assigned as either a hydrated magnesium carbonate [MgCO3&#8226;3H2O], or a hydroxy - hydrated - magnesium bicarbonate [Mg(HCO3)OH&#8226;2H2O]. The resolution of this controversy is central to understanding this material's thermodynamic, phase, and chemical behavior. We present an NMR crystallography study, using rotational-echo double-resonance 13C{1H} (REDOR) to determine 13C - 1H distances with precision, and the combination of 13C static NMR lineshapes and density - functional theory (DFT) calculations to model different H atomic coordinates. We find [MgCO3&#8226;3H2O] to be accurate, and evidence from neutron powder diffraction bolstered these assignments.&#160;Refined H positions can help us understand how H-bonding stabilizes this structure against dehydration to MgCO3. More broadly, our results illustrate the power of NMR crystallography as a technique for resolving questions where X-ray diffraction is inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Interactions Between Brilliant Green and MscL Investigated by Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy and Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state NMR and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to study the dynamic pathway of triarylmethane dye Brilliant Green (BG) through the antimicrobial target MscL protein. Key residues (especially F23 and I27) and the specific processes that act on BG through the Ma&#8208;MscL channel are identified, and proof is presented that BG activates the hydrophobic gate of Ma&#8208;MscL by its bound water molecules.







Abstract
The mechanosensitive ion channel of large conductance (MscL) is a promising template for the development of new antibiotics due to its high conservation and uniqueness to microbes. Brilliant green (BG), a triarylmethane dye, has been identified as a new antibiotic targeted MscL. However, the detailed binding sites to MscL and the dynamic pathway of BG through the MscL channel remain unknown. Here, the dynamic interactions between BG and MscL were investigated using solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and molecule dynamics (MD) simulations. Residue site&#8208;specific binding sites of BG to the MscL channel were identified by solid&#8208;state NMR. In addition, MD simulations revealed that BG conducts through the MscL channel via residues along the inner surface of the pore sequentially, in which the strong hydrophobic interactions between BG and hydrophobic residues F23 and I27 in the hydrophobic gate region of the MscL channel are major restrictions. Particularly, it was demonstrated that BG activates the MscL channel by reducing the hydrophobicity of the F23 in the gate region by water molecules that are bound to BG. Taken together, these simulations and experimental data provide novel insights into the dynamic interactions between BG and MscL, based on which new hydrophobic antibiotics and adjuvants targeting MscL can be developed.

         <title>Direct Aroylation of Olefins through a Cobalt/Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative and Dehydrogenative Coupling with &#945;&#8208;Oxo Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible light promotes decarboxylative Heck&#8208;like benzoylations of olefins. This process leverages the synergistic interaction of a photoredox catalyst with cobaloxime catalysts to form enones through decarboxylation and hydrogen evolution. Mechanistic studies reveal different rate&#8208;limiting steps, depending on electronics of the olefin.







Abstract
A photoredox/cobalt dual catalytic procedure has been developed that allows benzoylation of olefins. Here the photoredox catalyst effects the decarboxylation of &#945;&#8208;ketoacids to form benzoyl radicals. After addition of this radical to styrenes, the cobalt catalyst abstracts a H&#8208;atom. Hydrogen evolution from the putative cobalt hydride intermediate allows a Heck&#8208;like aroylation without the need for a stoichiometric oxidant. Mechanistic studies reveal that electronically different styrenes lead to a curved Hammett plot, thus suggesting a change in product&#8208;determining step in the catalytic mechanism.

         <title>Modeling Type&#8208;1 Iodothyronine Deiodinase with Peptide&#8208;Based Aliphatic Diselenides: Potential Role of Highly Conserved His and Cys Residues as a General Acid Catalyst</title>

         <dc:description>
Type&#8208;1&#8201;iodothyronine deiodinase, which promotes the deiodination of iodine atoms on the outer and inner rings of thyroxine, was successfully modeled using a peptide&#8208;based selenocompound. Kinetic analyses of this reaction suggested that highly conserved His and Cys residues at the active site crucially act as general acid catalysts together with the selenocysteine redox center. Modeling Type&#8208;1 Iodothyronine Deiodinase with Peptide&#8208;Based Aliphatic Diselenides: Potential Role of Highly Conserved His and Cys Residues as a General Acid Catalyst (K. Arai et&#8197;al.)







Abstract
Type&#8208;1 iodothyronine deiodinase (ID&#8208;1) catalyzes the reductive elimination of 5&#8217;&#8208;I and 5&#8208;I on the phenolic and tyrosyl rings of thyroxine (T4), respectively. Chemically verifying whether I atoms with different chemical properties undergo deiodination through a common mechanism is challenging. Herein, we report the modeling of ID&#8208;1 using aliphatic diselenide (Se&#8208;Se) and selenenylsulfide (Se&#8208;S) compounds. Mechanistic investigations of deiodination using the ID&#8208;1&#8208;like reagents suggested that the 5&#8217;&#8208;I and 5&#8208;I deiodinations proceed via the same mechanism through an unstable intermediate containing a Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I halogen bond between a selenolate anion, reductively produced from Se&#8208;Se (or Se&#8208;S) in the compound, and an I atom in T4. Moreover, imidazolium and thiol groups, which may act as general acid catalysts, promoted the heterolytic cleavage of the C&#8208;I bond in the Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I intermediate, which is the rate&#8208;determining step, by donating a proton to the C atom.

         <title>Heavy Chains: Synthesis, Reactivity and Decomposition of Interpnictogen Chains with Terminal Diaryl Bismuth Fragments</title>

         <dc:description>
Making and breaking chains. Interpnictogen chains have been synthesized, and their decomposition has been studied. It was shown that the compound Ph2BiP(tBu)BiPh2 reacts with the small N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (Me2IMe) as a &#8220;masked phosphinidene&#8221; to form Me2IMe=PtBu.







Abstract
In this work, we report the preparation of multiple interpnictogen chain compounds with three consecutive pnictogen atoms and terminal Ar2Bi fragments (Ar=Ph, Mes). Symmetrical compounds of the form Ar2Bi&#8722;E(tBu)&#8722;Bi2Ar (1: Ar=Ph, E=P; 2: Ar=Ph, Mes, E=As) as well as ternary interpnictogen compounds of the form Ar2Bi&#8722;E1(tBu)&#8722;E2tBu2 (Ar=Ph, Mes; 4: E1=P, E2=As; 5: E1=P, E2=Sb; 6: E1=As, E2=P) were prepared. The decomposition in solution at room temperature and under the influence of light was studied for compounds 1&#8211;6. The reactivity of 1Ph and 2Ph with the small N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene 1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (Me2IMe) was also studied. In the case of 1Ph, the formation and consecutive decomposition of Me2IMe=PtBu (8) was observed in solution. Hence, it was shown that 1Ph can react as a &#8220;masked phosphinidene&#8221;. In the case of 2Ph, no reaction with Me2IMe was observed. All isolated compounds were analysed by NMR and IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Gated, Selective Anion Exchange in Functionalized Self&#8208;Assembled Cage Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Appending functional groups to the exterior of Zn4L4 self&#8208;assembled cages allows gated control of anion binding. While the unfunctionalized cages contain aryl groups in the ligand that can freely rotate, attaching inert functional groups creates a &#8220;doorstop&#8221;, preventing rotation and slowing the guest exchange rate, even though the interiors of the host cavities are identically structured. The effects on anion exchange are subtle and depend on multiple factors, including anion size, the nature of the leaving anion, and the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability and steric bulk of the pendant groups. Multiple exchange mechanisms occur, and the nature of the external groups controls associative and dissociative exchange processes: these bulky groups affect both anion egress and ingress, introducing an extra layer of selectivity to the exchange. Small changes can have large effects: affinities for anions as similar as PF6&#8208; and SbF6&#8208; can vary by as much as 400&#8208;fold between identically sized cavities.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystallographic Deciphering of Spontaneous Self&#8208;Assembly of Achiral Calciphores to Chiral Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiapyricins (TPC&#8208;A/B, 1 and 2), which are novel metallophore scaffolds exhibiting selective divalent cation binding property, were produced in response to metal&#8208;deprived conditions by Saccharothrix sp. TRM_47004 isolated from the Lop Nor Salt Lake. TPCs represent a thiazolyl&#8208;pyridine skeleton of a calcium&#8208;binding natural product, calciphore, owing to the selectivity to calcium ions among diverse metal ions. The thiapyricins exhibited notable co&#8208;crystalline characteristics of the apo&#8208; and holo&#8208;forms with racemic enantiomers comprising a pair of space isomers in a &#916;/&#923;&#8208;form. Therefore, we postulated a mechanism for the four&#8208;hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of achiral natural products into chiral complexes. Furthermore, their metal&#8208;chelating trait aided the adaptation of the host during metal starvation by increasing the production of TPCs. This study presents a structural paradigm of a new calciphore, provides insight into the mechanism of natural product assembly, and highlights the causality between the production of the metallophore and metallic habitats.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoted Photothermal Catalytic CO Hydrogenation Using TiC&#8208;supported Co&#8208;Fe5C2&#160;Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photothermal catalytic CO hydrogenation offers the potential for synthesizing light hydrocarbons using renewable solar energy. However, the reaction selectivity and activity are still far below those achieved in the conventional thermal catalytic processes. Herein, we report that the Co&#8208;modified Fe5C2 on TiC catalyst promotes the photothermal catalytic CO hydrogenation with a 59% C2+ selectivity in the produced hydrocarbons and a 30% single&#8208;pass CO conversion at a high gas hourly space&#8208;time velocity of 12000 mL g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. Using insitu irradiated XPS, we show that the light&#8208;induced hot electron injection from TiC to Fe5C2 modulates the chemical state of Fe, thereby increasing the CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion. This work suggests that plasmon&#8208;mediated surface chemistry is possible to enhance the activity and selectivity of photothermal catalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Lead&#8208;Free Metal Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals: From Fundamentals to Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead&#8208;free metal halide Perovskite nanocrystals have emerged with promising properties to circumvent the important issues that still need to be addressed, such as stability and Pb toxicity, to enable practical and safe applications of perovskites.







Abstract
Lead (Pb) halide perovskite nanocrystals, with the general formula APbX3, where A=CH3NH3+, CH(NH2)2+, or Cs+ and X=Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, or I&#8722;, have emerged as a class of materials with promising properties due to their remarkable optical properties and solar cell performance. However, important issues still need to be addressed to enable practical applications of these materials, such as instability, mass production, and Pb toxicity. Recent studies have carried out the replacement of Pb by various less&#8208;toxic cations as Sn, Ge, Sb, and Bi. This variety of chemical compositions provide Pb&#8208;free perovskite and metal halide nanostructures with a wide spectral range, in addition to being considered less toxic, therefore having greater practical applicability. Highlighting the necessity to address and solve the toxicity problems related to Pb&#8208;containing perovskite, this review considers the prospects of the Pb&#8208;free perovskite, involving synthesis methods, and properties of them, including advantages, disadvantages, and applications.

         <title>Oxidative Cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 Linkage in Lignin via Co Nanoparticles Embedded in 3DNG as Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkage in lignin is one of the key steps for oxidative conversion of lignin to low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight aromatics. Herein, we prepare Co nanoparticles embedded in three&#8208;dimensional network of nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X) through immersion&#8208;pyrolysis procedure, in which X denotes the pyrolysis temperature. The detailed characterization of Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X shows that the Co nanoparticles are coated with a few layers of nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (NG) sheets that are further embedded in 3DNG matrix. The catalytic activities of the Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X for the oxidative cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkage in lignin model compounds with O2 as oxidant are explored. It is demonstrated that catalytic activities of as&#8208;prepared Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X can be tuned by varying the pyrolysis condition, and the Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;900 shows the highest catalytic activity, which is attributed to the enriched Co&#8208;Nx species, the strong surface basicity, and the mesoporous motif of 3DNG network. More pronouncedly, the Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;900 can also effectively catalyze the oxidative cleavage of organosolv lignin, generating certain monomeric aromatics. Additionally, the intrinsic magnetic property of Co nanoparticles makes the Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X be easily recovered from the reaction mixture, and the as&#8208;coated thin NG layer can protect Co nanoparticle from oxidation condition, which putting together afford the Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X with good reusability and stability.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic donor&#8208;acceptor complexes as new organic semiconductor class have attracted wide attention, due to their potential applications in functional optoelectronics. Herein, we present two new charge transfer cocrystals of di&#8208;cyanodiazafluorene (DCAF)&#8208;perylene (DCPE) and di&#8208;cyanodiazaflfluorene (DCAF)&#8208;pyrene (DCPY) through the rational cocrystal&#8208;engineering design. Although they are both 1:1 mixed stacking cocrystals with similar chemical structure, DCPE cocrystal possesses a non&#8208;centrosymmetric space group and narrower band gap compared to DPCY cocrystal, because of the non&#8208;covalent bonding variation. The electrostatic potential accumulated in the lateral facets leads to highly twisted nanobelts, and the strong H&#8208;aggregation causes fluorescence quenching. Meanwhile, the DCPY crystals with centrosymmetric space group and weaker intermolecular interactions show untwisted morphology and red emission. This study will be helpful for the design and understanding of functional cocrystal materials that can be used in flexible micro/nano&#8208;mechanics, mechanical energy, and optical devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Assembly of Helical Nanostructures: Solvent&#8208;Induced Morphology Transition and the Effect on Cell Adhesion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise manipulating both the morphology and chiroptical signals of supramolecular assemblies will help to better understand the natural biological self&#8208;assembly mechanism. Herein, two simple L/D&#8208;phenylalanine based derivatives (L/DPFM) are designed and their solvent&#8208;dependent morphology evolutions are illustrated. It is found that by increasing the content of H2O in the ethanol aqueous solutions, LPFM can self&#8208;assemble into right&#8208;handed nanofibers, flat fibrous structures and inversed left&#8208;handed nanofibers, respectively. The assemblies in ethanol and H2O exhibit opposite conformations and circular dichroism (CD) signals even though they are constructed from the same molecules. Thus, the morphology&#8208;dependent cell adhesion and proliferation behaviors are further characterized. Left&#8208;handed nanofibers are found to be more favorable for the cell adhesion compared with right&#8208;handed nanostructures. The quantitative AFM analysis showed that L929 cell adhesion force on left&#8208;handed LPFM fibers is much higher than that on structures with inversed handedness. Besides, the value of cell Young&#8217;s modulus is lower for left&#8208;handed nanofibrous films, which indicates better flexibility. The difference in cell&#8208;substrate interactions may lead to different effect on cell behaviors.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Coupling of Methane and Carbon Dioxide on Tantalum Cluster Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding molecular&#8208;scale reaction mechanisms is crucial for the design of modern catalysts with industrial prospect. Through joint experimental and computational studies, we investigate the direct coupling reaction of CH4 and CO2, two abundant greenhouse gases, mediated by Ta1,4+ ions to form larger oxygenated hydrocarbons. Coherent with proposed elementary steps, we expose products of CH4 dehydrogenation [Ta1,4CH2]+ to CO2 in a ring electrode ion trap. Product analysis and reaction kinetics indicate a predisposition of the tetramers for C&#8211;O coupling with a conversion to products of CH2O, whereas atomic cations enable C&#8211;C coupling yielding CH2CO. Many of the experimental findings are supported by thermodynamic computations, connecting structure, electronic properties, and catalyst function. Moreover, the study of bare Ta1,4+ compounds indicates that methane dehydrogenation is a significant initial step in the direct coupling reaction, enabling new, yet unknown reaction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Particle Measurements: A Powerful Method for the Investigation of Electrochemical Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The relationship between interface structure (e.g. the facet of the solid phase and the configuration of solvation) and the reactivity of corresponding electrode is a critical issue in electrochemistry. Compared to macroscopic electrode measurements, electrochemical methods established on the single&#8208;particle scale have advantages in establishing the structure&#8208;property relationship. In recent years, great achievements have been made in the electrochemical energy storage and electrocatalysis for understanding the evolution and kinetics of electrodes by employing single&#8208;particle measurements. This concept aims to provide an overview of the update of single&#8208;particle measurements in the related electrochemical processes. Furthermore, the challenges and prospects for the development and application of single&#8208;particle measurements are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogenation Reactions with Synergistic Catalysis of Pd single atoms and nanoparticles under Near&#8208;Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the limited resources and high cost of noble metals, how to boost their catalytic activities is highly desired in the current catalysis industry. Here, we report a synergetic catalyst, combining Pd2+ and Pd0 species in a nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbons (NPC), which shows boosted catalytic activities in hydrogenation reactions of organic nitro compounds (nitrobenzene, 4&#8208;nitrophenol, 1&#8208;nitronaphthalene and 1&#8208;nitropropane) under near ambient conditions. This synergetic catalyst NPC&#8208;[Pd] was synthesized by partial reduction of a palladium&#8208;loaded NPC. The catalytic activities and selectivity of NPC&#8208;[Pd] for hydrogenation were enhanced significantly compared with those of NPC&#8208;Pd2+ or NPC&#8208;Pd0 nanoparticles. Theoretical calculations show that H2 preferentially dissociates on Pd nanoparticles, and then organic molecules (nitrobenzene) can be captured and react with the dissociated H atom on Pd2+ sites. Similar reaction procedure also occur on Pt or Rh. Hydrogenation of different aromatic compounds with different functional groups (naphthalene, 4&#8208;nitrochlorobenzene, benzaldehyde and acetophenone) confirmed the broad excellent catalytic activity of this synergistic catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Homogeneous Dearomative Hydrogenation with a Co/P4N2 catalyst: a nucleophilic approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arene hydrogenation provides the most straightforward method to prepare carbo&#8208; and heterocycles, but the high resonance energy prevents an aromatic substrate from hydrogenation. We herein reported the homogeneous hydrogenation of less electron&#8208;rich arenes and heteroarenes in a nucleophilic manner. The Co(P4N2)H species that has been demonstrated to be a strong hydride donor could deliver a hydride ion to the cyano (hetero)arene substrates. Deuterium labeling experiments supported a Michael&#8208;type reaction pathway. Theoretical analyses have been conducted to investigate the hydricity of the catalytically active CoH species and the electrophilicity of the arene substrates. An outlook for more challenging substituted benzene was proposed based on the in&#8208;silico modification of the CoH species.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing the CRISPR&#8208;Cas13d System for Protein Detection via Dual&#8208;aptamer&#8208;based Transcription Amplification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CRISPR&#8208;based biosensing technology has been emerging as a revolutionary diagnostics for many diseases&#8208;related biomarkers. In particular, RspCas13d, a newly identified RNA&#8208;guided Cas13d ribonuclease derived from Ruminococcus sp., has shown great promise for accurate and sensitive detection of RNA due to its RNA sequence&#8208;specific recognition and robust collateral trans&#8208;cleavage activity. However, its diagnostic utility is limited to detect nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;related biomarkers. To address this limitation, we herein present a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of a target&#8208;responsive CRISPR&#8208;Cas13d sensing system for protein biomarkers. Such a system is rationally designed by integrating a Dual&#8208;Aptamer&#8208;based Transcription Amplification Strategy with CRISPR&#8208;Cas13d (DATAS&#8208;Cas13d), in which the protein binding initiates the  in vitro  RNA transcription followed by the activation of RspCas13d. Using a short fluorescent ssRNA as the signal reporter and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) as the model analyte, the DATAS&#8208;Cas13d system showed a wide linear range, low detection limit and high specificity for the detection of cTnI in buffer and human serum. Thanks to the facile integration of various bioreceptors into the DATAS&#8208;Cas13d system, the method could be adapted to detecting a broad range of clinically relevant protein biomarkers, and thus broaden the medical applications of Cas13d&#8208;based diagnostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Nontoxic Artificial Chloride Channel Formation in Epithelial Cells by Isophthalic Acid&#8208;Based Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial channels capable of facilitating the transport of Cl&#8210;  ions across cell membranes while being nontoxic to the cells are rare. Such synthetic ion channels can mimic the functions of membrane transport proteins and, therefore, have the potential to treat channelopathies by replacing defective ion channels. Here we report isophthalic acid&#8208;based structurally simple molecules  1a  and  2a, which self&#8208;assemble to render supramolecular nanochannels that allow selective transport of Cl&#8210;  ions. As evident from the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, the self&#8208;assembly is governed by intermolecular hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960;&#160;stacking interactions. The MD simulation studies for both  1a  and  2a  confirmed the formation of stable Cl&#8210;  channel assembly in the lipid membrane and Cl&#8210;  transport through them. The MQAE assay showed the efficacy of the compounds in delivering Cl&#8210;  ions into cells, and the MTT assays proved that the compounds are nontoxic to cells even at a concentration of 100 &#181;M.</dc:description>

         <title>Woven Polymer Networks: from Crystalline to Elastomeric Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Weaving technology has been extensively used for the manufacturing of macroscopical fabrics and satisfaction of artistic demands of humans through the ages. Integrating woven geometries into molecular structures is always a persistent pursuit, and yet a significant challenge of chemists, owing to the lack of effective methodologies to guide the regular mutual interlacing of molecular strands. In this Concept article, recent progress and related strategies in constructing woven polymer networks (WPNs) are summarized and discussed. An outlook was then given to highlight the future opportunities and challenges in the development of both molecularly woven structures and molecularly woven functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>G&#8208;Quadruplex Binding of a NIR Emitting Osmium Polypyridyl Probe Revealed by Solution NMR and   Time&#8208;Resolved Infrared Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>G&#8208;quadruplexes are emerging targets in cancer research and understanding how diagnostic probes bind to DNA G&#8209;quadruplexes in solution is critical to the development of new molecular tools. In this study the binding of an enantiopure NIR emitting [Os(TAP)2(dppz)]2+ complex to different G&#8208;quadruplex structures formed by human telomer (hTel) and cMYC sequences in solution is reported. The combination of NMR and time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopic techniques reveals the sensitivity of the emission response to subtle changes in the binding environment of the complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Pushing photochemistry into water: Acceleration of the di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;methane rearrangement and the Patern&#243;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction "on&#8208;water"</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two representative organic photoreactions, namely a bi&#173;molecular photocycloaddition and a monomolecular photo&#173;rearrange&#173;ment, are presented that are accelerated when the reaction is performed "on&#8208;water", that is, at the water&#8208;substrate interface with no solvation of the reaction components. According to the established models of ground&#8208;state reactions "on&#8208;water", the enhanced efficiency of the photoreactions is explained by hydrophobic effects (Patern&#243;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction) or specific hydrogen bonding (di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;methane rearrangement) at the water&#8208;substrate interface that decrease the energy of the respective transition state. These results point to the potential of this approach to conduct photo&#173;reactions more efficiently in an ecologically favorable medium.</dc:description>

         <title>Disproportionation and ligand lability in low oxidation state boryltin chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boryltin compounds featuring the metal in the +1 or 0 oxidation states can be synthesized from the carbene&#8208;stabilized tin(II) bromide (boryl)Sn(NHC)Br (boryl = {B(NDippCH)2}; NHC = C{(NiPrCMe)2}) by the use of strong reducing agents. The formation of the mono&#8208;carbene stabilized distannyne and donor&#8208;free distannide systems (boryl)SnSn(IPrMe)(boryl) (2) and K2[Sn2(boryl)2], (3) using Mg(I) and K reducing agents mirrors related germanium chemistry. In contrast to their lighter congeners, however, systems of the type [Sn(boryl)]n  are unstable with respect to disproportionation. Carbene abstraction from 2 using BPh3, and two&#8208;electron oxidation of 3 both result in the formation of a 2:1 mixture of the Sn(II) compound Sn(boryl)2, and the hexatin cluster, Sn6(boryl)4 (4). A viable mechanism for this rearrangement is shown by quantum chemical studies to involve a vinylidene intermediate (analogous to the isolable germanium compound, (boryl)2Ge=Ge), which undergoes facile atom transfer to generate Sn(boryl)2 and trinuclear [Sn3(boryl)2]. The latter then dimerizes to give the observed hexametallic product 4, with independent studies showing that similar trigermanium species aggregate in analogous fashion.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Si on the oxidation behaviors of Ti3Al1&#8722;xSixC2 at 1000 &#176;C</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, Ti3Al1&#8722;xSixC2 (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6) with Al/Si solid solution structure are synthesized, the effects of Si on their oxidation behaviors at 1000 &#186;C are evaluated. The addition of Si not only contributes to the formation of Ti5Si3 impurity but also affects the composition of the oxide scale. Particularly, incorporation of Si in the TiO2 lattice is demonstrated, which alters the formation energy of the (110) plane in TiO2, thus leading to the preferential growth of Si&#8208;doped TiO2 to dendritic congeries. Moreover, the Si addition is believed to affect mass transportation during the oxidation process, which accelerates the formation of a continuous Al2O3 layer in the oxide scale. With an optimized Si content, the oxidation of Ti3Al1&#8722;xSixC2 is restrained. However, with excess Si content, the continuity of the resulting Al2O3 layer is destroyed, thus the oxidation rate rises again.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this work, Ti3Al1&#8722;xSixC2 (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6) with Al/Si solid solution structure are synthesized, the effects of Si on their oxidation behaviors at 1000 &#186;C are evaluated. The addition of Si not only contributes to the formation of Ti5Si3 impurity but also affects the composition of the oxide scale. Particularly, incorporation of Si in the TiO2 lattice is demonstrated, which alters the formation energy of the (110) plane in TiO2, thus leading to the preferential growth of Si-doped TiO2 to dendritic congeries. Moreover, the Si addition is believed to affect mass transportation during the oxidation process, which accelerates the formation of a continuous Al2O3 layer in the oxide scale. With an optimized Si content, the oxidation of Ti3Al1&#8722;xSixC2 is restrained. However, with excess Si content, the continuity of the resulting Al2O3 layer is destroyed, thus the oxidation rate rises again.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoinduced Dehydrogenative Borylation via Dihydrogen Bond Bridged Electron Donor and Acceptor Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Air&#8208;stable amine&#8208; and phosphine&#8208;boranes are discovered as donors to integrate with pyridinium acceptor for generating photoactive electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes. Experimental results and DFT calculations suggest a dihydrogen bond bridging the donor and acceptor. Illuminating the EDA complex enables an intramolecular single electron transfer to give boron&#8208;centered radical for dehydrogenative borylation with no need of external photosensitizer and radical initiator. The deprotonation of Wheland&#8208;like radical intermediate rather than its generation is believed to determine the good ortho &#8208;selectivity based on DFT calculations. A variety of &#945;&#8208;borylated pyridine derivatives have been readily synthesized with good functional group tolerance.</dc:description>

         <title>Heteropoly Blue/Carbon Nanotubes Nanocomposites as High&#8208;Performance Photothermal Conversion Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To realize the direct and full use of the widely distributed solar energy, developing novel materials with superb photothermal conversion capability is essential. Although heteropoly blue has intrinsic outstanding solar absorption and photothermal conversion properties, its spectral absorption in the infrared region is weak. Here, composites of heteropoly blue and carbon nanotubes (HPB/CNTs) are synthesized depending on electrostatic interactions by facile microwave sonication and freeze&#8208;drying. The doped CNTs can dramatically improve the spectral absorption performance of HPB ontology in the infrared region. As a result, the light absorption of the optimized HPB/CNTs (20%) reaches more than 95 % in the range of 200&#8208;2400 nm, showing promising prospects as high&#8208;performance photothermal conversion material in the applications of solar desalination and wastewater treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Next Generation Copper Mediators for the Efficient Production of 18F&#8208;Labeled Aromatics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Evaluation of a series of Cu(II) complexes revealed several highly efficient mediators for radiofluorination of aryl boronic and stannyl substrates. After optimization of the reaction conditions, their application enabled preparation of seven PET&#8208;tracers in improved radiochemical yields and/or using significantly lower precursor loadings.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;mediated radiofluorination is a versatile tool for the preparation of 18F&#8208;labeled (hetero)aromatics. In this work, we systematically evaluated a series of complexes and identified several generally applicable mediators for highly efficient radiofluorination of aryl boronic and stannyl substrates. Utilization of these mediators in nBuOH/DMI or DMI significantly improved 18F&#8208;labeling yields despite use of lower precursor amounts. Impressively, application of 2.5&#8197;&#956;mol aryl boronic acids was sufficient to achieve 18F&#8208;labeling yields of up to 75&#8201;%. The practicality of the novel mediators was demonstrated by efficient production of five PET&#8208;tracers and transfer of the method to an automated radiosynthesis module. In addition, (S)&#8208;3&#8208;[18F]FPhe and 6&#8208;[18F]FDOPA were prepared in activity yields of 23&#177;1&#8201;% and 30&#177;3&#8201;% using only 2.5&#8197;&#956;mol of the corresponding boronic acid or trimethylstannyl precursor.

         <title>A Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter Investigated by Time&#8208;Resolved Near&#8208;Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free TADF (thermally activated delayed fluorescence) emitter was investigated by time&#8208;resolved near&#8208;infrared spectroscopy. This enabled upper excited states that contribute to spin&#8208;vibronic coupling to be detected.







Abstract
Emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) require small singlet (S1)&#8208;triplet (T1) energy gaps as well as fast intersystem crossing (ISC) transitions. These transitions can be mediated by vibronic mixing with higher excited states Sn and Tn (n=2, 3, 4, &#8230;). For a prototypical TADF emitter consisting of a triarylamine and a dicyanobenzene moiety (TAA&#8208;DCN) it is shown that these higher states can be located energetically by time&#8208;resolved near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectroscopy.

         <title>Activated Single&#8208;Phase Ti4O7 Nanosheets with Efficient Use of Precious Metal for Inspired Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;purity, single&#8208;crystal Ti4O7 nanosheets with a high specific surface area have been synthesized for the first time. Synergy and a strong metal&#8208;support interaction interface between Pt clusters and Ti4O7 were constructed with the assistance of visible light irradiation (650&#8197;nm). Continuous active sites (Ti3+, Pt2+, and Pt0+) for the ORR multielectron process are supplied. The new VI&#8722;Pt/Ti4O7 NSs exhibit excellent ORR activity.







Abstract
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is central to modern energy storage and conversion technologies for grids such as fuel cells and electrolyzers, but challenges remain due to the lack of reliable, economic, and durable electrocatalysts. Here, we develop single&#8208;crystal conductive black titanium (Ti4O7) nanosheets (NSs) as a new precious metal carrier based on sacrificial hard templates and ultrasonic&#8208;assisted peeling, and deposit Pt clusters on Ti4O7&#8201; NSs induced by wetness impregnation under the irradiation of visible light (VI; 650&#8197;nm). Pt/Ti4O7&#8201; NSs provide Ti3+, Pt2+, and Pt0+ continuous active sites for the ORR multielectron process, achieving synergy among them. The assistance of visible light not only makes a more uniform and smaller distribution of Pt nanoclusters, but also strengthens the charge transfer, thereby constructing a strong metal&#8208;support interaction interface. VI&#8722;Pt/Ti4O7&#8201; NSs show superior initial oxidation potential and a mass activity of 1.61&#8197;A&#8201;mg&#8722;1Pt at a E1/2=0.91&#8197;V, which is nine times higher than that of commercial Pt/C. This work provides an effective strategy for achieving high&#8208;value applications of titanium sub&#8208;oxides and further explores the enhanced interface in metals TinO2n&#8208;1 by light radiation.

         <title>The Influence of Small Biomolecules, Salts and Buffers on the Molecular Recognition of Amide Naphthotube in Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binding affinities of amide naphthotube to neutral organic molecules in water are not influenced by a majority of small biomolecules, inorganic salts, and PBS and Tris buffers.







Abstract
We found the binding affinities of amide naphthotube to neutral organic molecules in water are not influenced by most of small biomolecules, inorganic salts, and PBS and Tris buffers but are reduced in HEPES buffer through competitive binding. Nevertheless, salts do change the binding affinities of amide naphthotube to charged molecules through a screening effect.

         <title>An Extremely Stable Interprotein Tetrahedral Hg(Cys)4 Core Forms in the Zinc Hook Domain of Rad50 Protein at Physiological pH</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
HgII interacting with a naturally ZnII&#8208;containing Rad50 protein interface yields HgS4 species, the strongest metal&#8211;protein interaction known to date. It also introduces the novel manifestation of HgII mechanism of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Furthermore, the substitution of naturally occurring ZnII possibly has an impact on the quaternary structure and the protein assembly process, thus disrupting the DNA&#8208;repair mechanisms that engage the Mre11&#8211;Rad50 complex. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;Kr&#281;&#380;el and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202738).

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Arylation Polymerization for the Synthesis of Thiophene&#8208;Based Cross&#8208;linked Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An earth&#8208;abundant nickel(II) bipyridine catalyst allows the direct arylation polymerization of non&#8208;activated (poly)thiophenes with (poly)aryl halides leading to a series of 20 highly reticulated, porous and alternating conjugated polymers with yields from 50 to 99&#8201;%.







Abstract
An earth&#8208;abundant nickel(II) bipyridine catalyst, combined with lithium hexamethyldisilazide as base, demonstrates its wide applicability in the direct arylation polymerization of di&#8208; and tri&#8208;thiophene heteroaryls with poly(hetero)aryl halides. With a nickel catalyst loading of 2.5&#8197;mol%, a series of twenty highly cross&#8208;linked organic polymers is obtained in 34 to 99&#8201;% yields. Using mixed polytopic coupling partners allows obtaining alternating and optically active thiophene&#8208;based solids with intrinsic porosity.

         <title>Organocatalyzed Phospha&#8208;Michael Addition: A Highly Efficient Synthesis of Customized Bis(acyl)phosphane Oxide Photoinitiators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phospha&#8208;Michael addition of bis(mesitoyl)phosphine to a variety of activated C&#8722;C bonds was investigated. Simple amine bases were employed as catalysts, with tetramethylguanidine showing an outstanding performance and allowing the preparation of bis(acyl)phosphines under very mild conditions in excellent yields and short time. Oxidation of the bis(acyl)phosphines led to bis(acyl)phosphane oxides, a substance class belonging to the most potent photoinitiators.







Abstract
Addition of the P&#8722;H bond in bis(mesitoyl)phosphine, HP(COMes)2 (BAPH), to a wide variety of activated carbon&#8211;carbon double bonds as acceptors was investigated. While this phospha&#8208;Michael addition does not proceed in the absence of an additive or catalyst, excellent results were obtained with stoichiometric basic potassium or caesium salts. Simple amine bases can be employed in catalytic amounts, and tetramethylguanidine (TMG) in particular is an outstanding catalyst that allows the preparation of bis(acyl)phosphines, R&#8722;P(COMes)2, under very mild conditions in excellent yields after only a short time. All phosphines RP(COMes)2 can subsequently be oxidized to the corresponding bis(acyl)phosphane oxides, RPO(COMes)2, a substance class belonging to the most potent photoinitiators for radical polymerizations known to date. Thus, a simple and highly atom economic method has been found that allows the preparation of a broad range of photoinitiators adapted to their specific field of application even on a large scale.

         <title>Enhancing the Resistive Switching Behavior of WORM Memory Devices using D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A Based Ester&#8208;Flanked Quinolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Donor&#8208;Acceptor systems are highly appreciated in the field of organic memory devices due to their efficient charge transport within the systems. In this work, we have designed and synthesized a D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A system constituting ester&#8208;flanked quinolines and functionalized triarylamines (TAA) through a single&#8208;step cross&#8208;coupling reaction to fabricate memory devices via Write&#8208;Once Read&#8208;Many times (WORM) non&#8208;volatile memory. Structure&#8208;property relationships are reconnoitered for these conjugated D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A systems through a series of UV, fluorescence, XRD, DFT, and memory characterizations. The UV and CV data show efficient charge transfer with intramolecular charge transfer occurring at 407&#8208; 417 nm and a short band gap of 2.56&#8208; 2.65 eV. An enhancement in the resistive switching behavior of the memory devices is observed for the compounds with simple TAA&#8208;quinoline and tert&#8208;butylphenyl substituted TAA and fluorophenyl substituted quinoline due to balanced charge distribution in the compounds. This enhanced switching induces an on/off ratio of 103 by generating a highly ordered arrangement in the thin films. The HOMO, LUMO levels, and the ESP images together estimate a charge transfer and charge trapping as the plausible mechanism for the solution&#8208;processable WORM memory devices. The longer retention time (103 s) and lower threshold voltages (&#8208;1.21 &#8208; &#8208;2.12 V) of the devices makes them intriguing compounds for memory applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Interplay between hydrogen bonding and electron transfer in mixed valence assemblies of triarylamine trisamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions are assumed to play a critical role in the long&#8208;range transport of light or charge recently observed in supramolecular assemblies of C3&#8208;symmetrical discotic molecules. Herein, the structure of mixed valence assemblies formed by irradiating triarylamine trisamide (TATA) molecules was determined by multifarious techniques under various conditions with the aim of probing the interplay between the hydrogen bonding network and the rate of electron transport in different states (solution, gel, film). Irradiation was performed under initial states that vary by the degree of association of TATA monomers through hydrogen bonds. Firstly, a significant shift of the N&#9472;H and C=O stretching frequencies was observed by FT&#8208;IR upon irradiation thus revealing an overlooked signature of TATA&#8226;+ species and interacting mixed valence aggregates. Secondly, gels and films both mostly consist of hydrogen&#8208;bonded TATA polymers but their EPR spectra recorded at 293 K reveal very different behaviors: localized electrons in the gels versus fully delocalized electrons in the films. Hydrogen bonding thus appears as a necessary but not sufficient condition to get fast electron transfer rates and a packing of the TATA monomers particularly suitable for charge transport is assumed to exist in the solid state. Finally, defects in the hydrogen bonding network are detected upon increasing the number of radical species in the mixed valence assemblies present in the film state without impeding the delocalization of the unpaired electrons. A delicate balance between hydrogen bonds and packing is thus necessary to get supramolecular polarons in mixed valence TATA assemblies.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen-bonding interactions are assumed to play a critical role in the long-range transport of light or charge recently observed in supramolecular assemblies of C3-symmetrical discotic molecules. Herein, the structure of mixed valence assemblies formed by irradiating triarylamine trisamide (TATA) molecules was determined by multifarious techniques under various conditions with the aim of probing the interplay between the hydrogen bonding network and the rate of electron transport in different states (solution, gel, film). Irradiation was performed under initial states that vary by the degree of association of TATA monomers through hydrogen bonds. Firstly, a significant shift of the N&#9472;H and C=O stretching frequencies was observed by FT-IR upon irradiation thus revealing an overlooked signature of TATA&#8226;+ species and interacting mixed valence aggregates. Secondly, gels and films both mostly consist of hydrogen-bonded TATA polymers but their EPR spectra recorded at 293 K reveal very different behaviors: localized electrons in the gels versus fully delocalized electrons in the films. Hydrogen bonding thus appears as a necessary but not sufficient condition to get fast electron transfer rates and a packing of the TATA monomers particularly suitable for charge transport is assumed to exist in the solid state. Finally, defects in the hydrogen bonding network are detected upon increasing the number of radical species in the mixed valence assemblies present in the film state without impeding the delocalization of the unpaired electrons. A delicate balance between hydrogen bonds and packing is thus necessary to get supramolecular polarons in mixed valence TATA assemblies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Caging of a Strongly Pairing Fluorescent Thymidine Analog with Soft Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling the pairing strength of nucleobases in DNA through reactions with compounds found inside the cell is a formidable challenge. Here we report how a thiazolyl substituent turns a strongly pairing ethynylpyridone C&#8208;nucleoside into a reactive residue in oligonucleotides. The thiazolyl&#8208;bearing pyridone reacts with soft nucleophiles, such as glutathione, but not with hard nucleophiles like hydroxide or carbonate. The addition products pair much more weakly with adenine in a complementary strand than the starting material, and also change their fluorescence. This makes oligonucleotides containing the new deoxynucleoside interesting for controlled release. Due to its reactivity toward N, P, S, and Se&#8208;nucleophiles, and the visual signal accompanying chemical conversion, the fluorescent nucleotide reported here may also have applications in chemical biology, sensing and diagnostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Organometallic Pt(II) Photosensitisers that Demonstrate Ligand&#8208;Modulated Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation Energy Upconversion Efficiencies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of 2&#8208;phenylquinoxaline ligands have been synthesised that introduce either CF3 or OCF3 electron withdrawing groups at different positions of the phenyl ring. These ligands were investigated as cyclometalating reagents for Pt(II) to give neutral complexes of the form [Pt(C^N)(acac)] (where C^N = cyclometalating ligand; acac = acetyl acetonate). X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies on three examples showed that the complexes adopt an approximate square planar geometry. All examples revealed strong Pt&#8722;Pt linear contacts of 3.2041(6), 3.2199(3) and 3.2586(2) &#197;. The highly coloured complexes display efficient visible absorption at 400&#8208;500 nm (&#949; ~ 5000 M&#8208;1 cm&#8208;1) and orange&#8208;red photoluminescent characteristics (&#955;em = 603&#8208;620 nm; &#934;em &#8804; 37%) which were subtly tuned by the ligand. Triplet emitting character was confirmed via microsecond luminescence lifetimes and the photogeneration of singlet oxygen with quantum efficiencies up to 57%. Each complex was investigated as a photosensitiser for triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation energy upconversion using 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene as the annihilator species: a range of good upconversion efficiencies (&#934;UC 5.9&#8208;14.1%) were observed and shown to be strongly influenced by the ligand structure in each case.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>5&#8208;Diethylboryl&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (1), which is inaccessible using conventional batch methods, was synthesized using a flow microreactor. Compound 1 was obtained as an equilibrium mixture of a cyclic trimer and a cyclic tetramer in solution, the latter of which was crystallized in benzene by vapor diffusion of hexane at 7 &#176;C. The dynamic nature of this system was confirmed by solvent&#8208; and concentration&#8208;dependent experiments. Notably, the dynamics was verified using flow NMR spectroscopy, which revealed that the time required to reach equilibrium was influenced by the solvent ratio (&lt;18 s, 24&#8211;28 s, and 34&#8211;42 s in 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2 mixtures of acetone&#8208;d6 and C6D6, respectively). Compound 1 and 3&#8208;[4&#8242;&#8208;(diethylboryl)phenyl]pyridine (2) exhibited different self&#8208;assembly behavior in solution and crystals. Density functional theory calculations suggested that this difference was largely due to enhanced planarity between two consecutive aromatic rings.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Carbon&#8211;Heteroatom Coupling
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exogenous photocatalyst&#8208;free, single nickel&#8208;catalyzed carbon&#8211;heteroatom coupling under visible&#8208;light irradiation is reported. Over 15&#8197;classes of nucleophile can efficiently couple with aryl/alkene halides to afford valuable heteroatomic arenes/alkenes. The unprecedentedly broad substrate scope and late&#8208;stage modification of valuable molecules fully demonstrate the benefits of the method.







Abstract
Herein, we report visible light&#8208;promoted single nickel catalysis for diverse carbon&#8211;heteroatom couplings under mild conditions. This mild, general, and robust method to couple diverse nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur nucleophiles with aryl(heteroaryl)/alkenyl iodides/bromides exhibits a wide functional group tolerance and is applicable to late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals and natural products. On the base of preliminary mechanistic studies, a NiI/NiIII cycle via the generation of active NiI complexes that appear from homolysis of NiII&#8722;I rather than NiII&#8722;aryl bond was tentatively proposed.

         <title>Recent Progress in Rechargeable Sodium Metal Batteries: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High energy density and long lifespan sodium metal batteries. In this review, recent progress in high energy density and long lifespan SMBs is summarized from the aspects of modification of the sodium metal anode, electrolyte exploration, and cathode design. In addition, some insights toward their practical applications are introduced.







Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) have been widely studied owing to their relatively high energy density and abundant resources. However, they still need systematic improvement to fulfill the harsh operating conditions for their commercialization. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in SMBs in terms of sodium anode modification, electrolyte exploration, and cathode design. Firstly, we give an overview of the current challenges facing Na metal anodes and the corresponding solutions. Then, the traditional liquid electrolytes and the prospective solid electrolytes for SMBs are summarized. In addition, insertion&#8208; and conversion&#8208;type cathode materials are introduced. Finally, an outlook for the future of practical SMBs is provided.

Abstract
A highly unusual solid&#8208;state epitaxy&#8208;induced phase transformation of Na4SnS4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;14H2O (I) into Na4Sn2S6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;5H2O (II) occurs at room temperature. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations indicate an internal acid&#8208;base reaction to form [SnS3SH]3&#8722; which condensates to [Sn2S6]4&#8722;. The reaction involves a complex sequence of O&#8722;H bond cleavage, S2&#8722; protonation, Sn&#8722;S bond formation and diffusion of various species while preserving the crystal morphology. In&#8197;situ Raman and IR spectroscopy evidence the formation of [Sn2S6]4&#8722;. DFT calculations allowed assignment of all bands appearing during the transformation. X&#8208;ray diffraction and in&#8197;situ 1H&#8197;NMR demonstrate a transformation within several days and yield a reaction turnover of &#8776;0.38&#8201;%/h. AIMD and experimental ionic conductivity data closely follow a Vogel&#8208;Fulcher&#8208;Tammann type T dependence with D(Na)=6&#215;10&#8722;14&#8197;m2&#8201;s&#8722;1 at T=300&#8197;K with values increasing by three orders of magnitude from &#8722;20 to +25&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Chiral Naphthalenediimides with High&#8208;Efficiency Fluorescence and Circularly Polarized Luminescence in the Solid State for the Application in Organic Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral non&#8208;core substituted naphthalenediimides (NDIs) exhibit an L&#8208;shape conformation and self&#8208;assemble into discrete dimers in the solid state. The unique discrete dimeric stacking significantly promoted the fluorescence quantum yields and chiroptical properties via the formation of pre&#8208;associated excimers. The findings disrupt the general idea that non&#8208;core substituted NDIs cannot exhibit strong fluorescence in the solid state.







Abstract
Naphthalenediimides (NDIs) have been extensively studied due to their tunable luminescent properties. However, generally, the monomers or aggregates of non&#8208;core substituted NDIs exhibit low fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;FL&lt;10&#8201;%) in the solid state, which limit their applications as light&#8208;emitting materials and render their chiral species unsuitable for circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Herein, a series of non&#8208;core substituted chiral NDIs that exhibit high luminous efficiencies (&#934;FL up to 56.8&#8201;% for racemate and 36.5&#8201;% for enantiomer) and a strong CPL behavior in the solid state is reported. These significant improvements are attributed to the unique molecular conformation of the chiral NDIs and the formation of distinctive discrete dimers. The structures of the NDIs were significantly simpler and more accessible than those of other NDIs. The findings evidence that non&#8208;core substituted NDIs can exhibit strong fluorescence in the solid state and provide a new pathway to improve photophysical properties of NDIs.

         <title>Isolation and Reactivity of Stannylenoids Stabilized by Amido/Imino Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel stannylenoid was isolated by using a bulky amido ligand. It can be converted to the dimeric chlorostannylene at 80&#8201;&#176;C with the elimination of LiCl. Treatment of the amidostannylenoid with IPrNLi (IPrN=bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;iminato) led to the formation of amido(imino)stannylene. In addition, the reaction of bis(imino)stannylenoid with N2O resulted in a dimeric Sn/O/Li complex.







Abstract
The reaction of the lithium aryl(silyl)amide Dipp(iPr3Si)NLi (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) with one equivalent of SnCl2 in THF gave a novel stannylenoid Dipp(iPr3Si)NSnCl&#8901;LiCl(THF)2. Heating the solution of amidostannylenoid in toluene to 80&#8201;&#176;C resulted in dimeric amido(chloro)stannylene [Dipp(iPr3Si)NSnCl]2, which can be converted to bis(amido)stannylene Sn[N(Dipp)(iPr3Si)]2 and amido(imino)stannylene Sn[N(Dipp)(iPr3Si)][IPrN] (IPrN=bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;imino). Treatment of bis(imino)stannylenoid [IPrN]2Sn(Cl)Li with N2O resulted in the dimeric complex [IPrNSn(Cl)OLi]2. All compounds were characterized by NMR, elementary analysis, and X&#8208;ray structural determination.

         <title>Intra&#8208; and Intermolecular Cooperativity in the Catalytic Activity of Phosphodiester Cleavage by Self&#8208;Assembled Systems Based on Guanidinylated Calix[4]arenes.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Calix[4]arene scaffold, blocked in the cone conformation through alkylation with long alkyl chains, and decorated at the upper rim with four guanidine or arginine units, effectively catalyzes the cleavage of the phosphodiester bond of DNA and RNA model compounds in water. An exhaustive kinetic investigation unequivocally points to the existence of spontaneous aggregation phenomena, driven by hydrophobic interactions, occurring at different critical concentrations that depend on the identity of the compound. A pronounced superiority of the assembled structures compared with the monomers in solution was observed. Moreover, the catalytically active units, clustered on the macrocyclic tetrafunctional scaffold, were proved to efficiently cooperate in the catalytic mechanism and result in improved reaction rates compared to those of the monofunctional model compounds. The kinetic analysis is also integrated and corroborated with further experiments based on fluorescence spectroscopy and light scattering.
The advantage of the supramolecular assemblies based on tetrafunctional calixarenes leads to believe that the active units can cooperate not only intramolecularly but also intermolecularly. The molecules in the aggregates can probably mold, flex and rearrange but, at the same time, keep an ordered structure that favor phosphodiester bond cleavage. This dynamic preorganization can allow the catalytic units to reach a better fitting with the substrates and perform a superior catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Dichromic Allophycocyanin Trimer Covering a Broad Spectral Range (550&#8208;660 nm)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phycobilisomes, the light&#8208;harvesting complexes of cyanobacteria and red algae, are a resource for photosynthetic, photonic and fluorescence labeling elements. They cover an exceptionally broad spectral range, but the complex super structure and assembly has been an obstacle. By replacing in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 the biliverdin reductases, we studied the role of chromophores in the assembly of the phycobilisome core. Introduction of the green&#8208;absorbing phycoerythrobilin instead of the red&#8208;absorbing phycocyanobilin inhibited aggregation. A novel, trimeric allophycocyanin (Dic&#8208;APC) was obtained. In the small (110 kDa) unit, the two chromophores, phycoerythrobilin and phytochromobilin, cover a wide spectral range (550 to 660 nm). Due to efficient energy transfer, it provides an efficient artificial light&#8208;harvesting element. Dic&#8208;APC was generated in vitro using the contained core&#8208;linker, LC, for template&#8208;assisted purification and assembly. Labeling the linker provides a method for targeting Dic&#8208;APC.</dc:description>

         <title>How to Shrink the Ring: Phospholenes from Phosphabenzenes via Selective Ring Contraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A 3&#8208;aminofunctionalized phosphabenzene (phosphinine) was synthesized and structurally characterized. The pyramidalized nitrogen atom of the dimethylamino substituent indicates only a weak interaction between the lone pair of the nitrogen atom and the aromatic phosphorus heterocycle, resulting in somewhat basic character. It turned out that the amino group can indeed be protonated by HCl. In contrast to pyridines, however, the phosphabenzene&#8208;ammonium salt undergoes a selective ring contraction to form a hydroxylphospholene oxide in the presence of additional water. Based on deuterium labelling experiments and quantum chemical calculations, a rational mechanism for this hitherto unknown conversion is proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and Functional Insight into the Mechanism of the Fe&#8208;S Cluster&#8208;Dependent Dehydratase from Paralcaligenes ureilyticus.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme&#8208;catalyzed reaction cascades play an increasingly important role for the sustainable manufacture of diverse chemicals from renewable feedstocks. For instance, dehydratases from the ilvD/EDD superfamily have been embedded into a cascade to convert glucose via pyruvate to isobutanol, a platform chemical for the production of aviation fuels and other valuable materials. These dehydratases depend on the presence of both a Fe&#8208;S cluster and a divalent metal ion for their function. However, they also represent the rate&#8208;limiting step in the cascade. Here, catalytic parameters and the crystal structure of the dehydratase from Paralcaligenes ureilyticus (PuDHT, both in presence of Mg2+ and Mn2+) were investigated. Rate measurements demonstrate that the presence of stoichiometric concentrations Mn2+ promotes higher activity than Mg2+, but at high concentrations the former inhibits the activity of PuDHT. Molecular dynamics simulations identify the position of a second binding site for the divalent metal ion. Only binding of Mn2+ (not Mg2+) to this site affects the ligand environment of the catalytically essential divalent metal binding site, thus providing insight into an inhibitory mechanism of Mn2+ at higher concentrations. Furthermore, in silico docking identified residues that play a role in determining substrate binding and selectivity. The combined data inform engineering approaches to design an optimal dehydratase for the cascade.</dc:description>

Mechanistically the reaction comprises fluoride to bromide ligand exchange on an aryl boron species and consecutive C&#8722;B bond cleavage to deliver a broad range of functionalized products. The reaction is high yielding, has a broad substrate scope where several different heteroarenes can be functionalized with chloro, bromo, iodo, hydroxyl, amine and BF2&#160;in a highly regioselective fashion. The method can be applied for late&#8208;stage functionalization or for rapid skeleton remodeling with for instance cross&#8208;couplings.</dc:description>

         <title>A Simple Substitution on Thyroid Hormones Remarkably Alters the Regioselectivity of Deiodination by a Deiodinase Mimic</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regioselective deiodinations of L&#8208;thyroxine (T4) play key roles in the thyroid hormone homeostasis. These reactions are catalyzed by three isoforms of the selenoenzymes, iodothyronine deiodinases (Dio1, Dio2 and Dio3), which are highly homologous in nature. Dio1 mediates 5&#8242;&#8208; or 5&#8208;deiodinations of T4 to produce T3 and rT3, respectively. In contrast, Dio2 and Dio3 are selective to 5&#8242;&#8208; or 5&#8208;deiodination to produce T3 and rT3, respectively. Understanding of the regioselectivity of deiodination at the molecular level is important as abnormal levels of thyroid hormone have been implicated in various clinical conditions, such as hypoxia, myocardial infarction, neuronal ischemia and cancer. In this paper, we report that the electronic properties of the iodine atoms in thyroxine (T4) can be modulated through a simple substitution in the 4'&#8208;phenolic moiety. This leads to the change in the regioselectivity of&#160;deiodination by different small molecule mimics of Dio enzymes. By using this chemical approach, we also show that the substitution of a strong electron withdrawing group facilitates the removal all four iodine atoms in the T4 derivative. Theoretical investigations on the hydrogen bonded adducts of T4 with imidazole indicate that the charge on the iodine atoms depend on the nature of hydrogen bond between the &#8208;OH group of T4 and the imidazole moiety. While the imidazole can act as either hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) or hydrogen bond donor (HBD), the protonated imidazole acts exclusively as HBD in T4&#8208;imidazole complex. These studies support the earlier observations that the histidine residue at the active sites of the deiodinases play an important role not only in the substrate binding, but also in altering the regioselectivity of the deiodination reactions.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The regioselective deiodinations of L-thyroxine (T4) play key roles in the thyroid hormone homeostasis. These reactions are catalyzed by three isoforms of the selenoenzymes, iodothyronine deiodinases (Dio1, Dio2 and Dio3), which are highly homologous in nature. Dio1 mediates 5&#8242;- or 5-deiodinations of T4 to produce T3 and rT3, respectively. In contrast, Dio2 and Dio3 are selective to 5&#8242;- or 5-deiodination to produce T3 and rT3, respectively. Understanding of the regioselectivity of deiodination at the molecular level is important as abnormal levels of thyroid hormone have been implicated in various clinical conditions, such as hypoxia, myocardial infarction, neuronal ischemia and cancer. In this paper, we report that the electronic properties of the iodine atoms in thyroxine (T4) can be modulated through a simple substitution in the 4'-phenolic moiety. This leads to the change in the regioselectivity of&#160;deiodination by different small molecule mimics of Dio enzymes. By using this chemical approach, we also show that the substitution of a strong electron withdrawing group facilitates the removal all four iodine atoms in the T4 derivative. Theoretical investigations on the hydrogen bonded adducts of T4 with imidazole indicate that the charge on the iodine atoms depend on the nature of hydrogen bond between the -OH group of T4 and the imidazole moiety. While the imidazole can act as either hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) or hydrogen bond donor (HBD), the protonated imidazole acts exclusively as HBD in T4-imidazole complex. These studies support the earlier observations that the histidine residue at the active sites of the deiodinases play an important role not only in the substrate binding, but also in altering the regioselectivity of the deiodination reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coupling Value&#8208;Added Anodic Reactions with Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction features a promising approach to realize carbon neutrality. However, its competitiveness is limited by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at anode, which consumes a large portion of energy. Coupling value&#8208;added anodic reactions with CO2 electroreduction has been emerging as a promising strategy in recent years to enhance the full&#8208;cell energy efficiency and produce valuable chemicals at both cathode and anode of the electrolyzer. In this review, we briefly summarize recent progresses on the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, and the economic feasibility of different CO2 electrolysis system is discussed. Then we provide a comprehensive summary of recent advances in the coupled electrolysis of CO2 and potential value&#8208;added anodic reactions, with special focus on the specific cell designs. Finally, current challenges and future opportunities for the coupled electrolysis systems are also proposed, which are targeted to facilitate progress in this field and push the CO2 electrolyzers to a more practical level.</dc:description>

Base pair stabilizers 1 and 2 were used to drive isothermal displacement reactions. Fluorescent pyrene sensors were developed to monitor the reaction progress by fluorescence change.







Abstract
Purine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine and 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;7&#8208;bromopurine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyribonucleosides (1 and 2) were implemented in isothermal DNA strand displacement reactions. Nucleoside 1 is a weak stabilizer of dA&#8208;dT base pairs, nucleoside 2 evokes strong stabilization. Strand displacement reactions used single&#8208;stranded invaders with single and multiple incorporations of stabilizers. Displacement is driven by negative enthalpy changes between target and displaced duplex. Toeholds are not required. Two new environmental sensitive fluorescent pyrene sensors were developed to monitor the progress of displacement reactions. Pyrene was connected to the nucleobase in the invader or to a dendritic linker in the output strand. Both new sensors were constructed by click chemistry; phosphoramidites and oligonucleotides were prepared. Sensors show monomer or excimer emission. Fluorescence intensity changes when the displacement reaction progresses. Our work demonstrates that strand displacement with base pair stabilizers is applicable to DNA, RNA and to related biopolymers with applications in chemical biology, nanotechnology and medicinal diagnostics.

         <title>Carbodicarbenes and Striking Redox Transitions of their Conjugate Acids: Influence of NHC versus CAAC as Donor Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structures and coordination behavior of carbodicarbenes bearing three possible combinations of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and cyclic(alkyl)(amino)(carbene) (CAAC) are compared. The strikingly different redox transitions of their conjugate acids are also reported.







Abstract
Herein, a new type of carbodicarbene (CDC) comprising two different classes of carbenes is reported; NHC and CAAC as donor substituents and compare the molecular structure and coordination to Au(I)Cl to those of NHC&#8208;only and CAAC&#8208;only analogues. The conjugate acids of these three CDCs exhibit notable redox properties. Their reactions with [NO][SbF6] were investigated. The reduction of the conjugate acid of CAAC&#8208;only based CDC with KC8 results in the formation of hydrogen abstracted/eliminated products, which proceed through a neutral radical intermediate, detected by EPR spectroscopy. In contrast, the reduction of conjugate acids of NHC&#8208;only and NHC/CAAC based CDCs led to intermolecular reductive (reversible) carbon&#8211;carbon sigma bond formation. The resulting relatively elongated carbon&#8211;carbon sigma bonds were found to be readily oxidized. They were, thus, demonstrated to be potent reducing agents, underlining their potential utility as organic electron donors and n&#8208;dopants in organic semiconductor molecules.

         <title>Reactivity of Sodium Pentaphospholide Na[cyclo&#8208;P5] towards C&#8801;E (E=C, N, P) Triple Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[Cyclo&#8208;P5]&#8722; reacts with alkynes and the isolobal nitriles and phosphaalkynes to generate novel, aromatic, five&#8208;membered heterocycles. DFT calculations give insight into the mechanism of the reaction. The anionic ligands coordinate in an &#951;5&#8208;fashion towards FeII to give the corresponding (aza)phosphametallocenes, which could be characterized crystallographically.







Abstract
A diglyme solution of Na[cyclo&#8208;P5] (1) reacts with alkynes and isolobal nitriles and phosphaalkynes to afford the otherwise elusive (aza)phospholide anions 2&#8201;a&#8211;c, 4&#8201;a,b, and 6. The reaction of Na[cyclo&#8208;P5] with alkynes and nitriles was studied by means of DFT methods, which suggested a concerted mechanism for the formation of 2&#8201;a and 4&#8201;b. The anions 2&#8201;a&#8211;c, 4&#8201;a,b, and 6 coordinate in an &#951;5&#8208;fashion towards FeII to give the sandwich (aza)phosphametallocenes 3&#8201;a&#8211;c, 5&#8201;a,b and 7 in moderate to good yields. The new compounds were characterized by means of multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and cyclic voltammetry.

The reaction of Na[&lt;i&gt;cyclo&lt;/i&gt;-P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;] with alkynes and nitriles was studied by means of DFT methods, which suggested a concerted mechanism for the formation of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;. The anions &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;a,b&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; coordinate in an &lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Dehydropolymerization of Phosphine&#8211;Boranes at Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyphosphinoboranes [PhRP&#8208;BH2]n, including P&#8208;disubstituted derivatives, were accessed by deprotonation of a series of readily prepared phosphine&#8211;(triflimido)borane adducts. The choice of base impacts the polymer molar mass and linear/cyclic ratio and transient phosphinoborane monomers, RR'P&#8208;BH2 are proposed intermediates.







Abstract
Stoichiometric reaction of phosphine&#8211;borane adducts RR'PH&#8901;BH3 (R=Ph, R&#8217;=H, Ph, Et, and R=R&#8217;=tBu) with the strong acid HNTf2 (Tf=SO2CF3) leads to H2 elimination and the formation of the triflimido derivatives, RR'PH&#8901;BH2(NTf2). Subsequent deprotonation by using bases, such as diisopropylethylamine or the carbene IPr (IPr=N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene), led to the formation of P&#8208;mono&#8208; or &#8208;disubstituted polyphosphinoboranes [RR'P&#8208;BH2]n. Evidence for the intermediacy of transient phosphinoborane monomers, RR'PBH2, was provided by trapping reactions.

         <title>Co&#8208;based Catalysts for Selective H2O2 Electroproduction via 2&#8208;electron Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process is emerging as a promising alternative method to the conventional anthraquinone process. To realize high&#8208;efficiency H2O2 electrosynthesis, robust and low cost electrocatalysts have been intensively pursued, among which Co&#8208;based catalysts attract particular research interests due to the earth&#8208;abundance and high selectivity. Here, we provide a comprehensive review on the advancement of Co&#8208;based electrocatalyst for H2O2 electroproduction. The fundamental chemistry of 2&#8208;electron ORR is discussed firstly for guiding the rational design of electrocatalysts. Subsequently, the development of Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts involving nanoparticles, compounds and single atom catalysts is summarized with the focus on active site identification, structure regulation and mechanism understanding. Moreover, the current challenges and future directions of the Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts are briefly summarized in this review.</dc:description>

         <title>Dielectric Relaxation and Dielectric Switching Behaviors in (N,N&#8208;Diisopropylethylamine) Tetrachloroantimonate(III)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dielectric relaxation and dielectric switching behaviors of a novel antimony&#8208;based halide semiconductor are characterized by experiments and first&#8208;principles molecular dynamics simulations. It contains a 1D chain, undergoes an isostructural order&#8208;disorder phase transition and shows a step&#8208;like dielectric anomaly, which can function as a frequency&#8208;tuned dielectric switch with highly adjustable switch temperature.







Abstract
Dielectric switches have drawn renewed attention to the study of their many potential applications with the adjustable switch temperatures (Ts). Herein, a novel antimony&#8208;based halide semiconductor, (N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine) tetrachloroantimonate ((DIPEA)SbCl4, DIPEA+=N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine), with dielectric relaxation behavior and dielectric switches has been successfully synthesized. This compound, consisting of coordinated anion 
 chains and isolated DIPEA+ cations, undergoes an isostructural order&#8208;disorder phase transition and shows a step&#8208;like dielectric anomaly, which can function as a frequency&#8208;tuned dielectric switch with highly adjustable switch temperature (Ts). Variable&#8208;temperature single&#8208;crystal structure analyses and first&#8208;principles molecular dynamics simulations give information about the general mechanisms of molecular dynamics. This work enriches the dielectric switch family and proves that hybrid metal halides are promising candidates for switchable physical or chemical properties.

         <title>Pentacyclic and Hexacyclic Osmaarynes and Their Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex world of osmium: The first pentacyclic and hexacyclic osmaaryne have been successfully synthesized. The nucleophilic reaction of osmaarynes was used to obtain the corresponding osmium complexes, which exhibited near&#8208;infrared luminescence, aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and photothermal conversion.







Abstract
Although osmabenzyne, osmanaphthalyne, osmaphenanthryne, and osmaanthracyne have been previously reported, the synthesis of polycyclic osmaarynes is still a challenge. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of the first pentacyclic osmaarynes (pyreno[b]osmabenzynes 1&#8201;a and 2&#8201;a) and hexacyclic osmaaryne (peryleno[b]osmabenzyne 3&#8201;a). Nucleophilic reaction of osmaarynes was used to obtain the corresponding pyreno[b]osmium complexes (1 and 2) and peryleno[b] osmium complex (3), which exhibited near&#8208;infrared luminescence and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties. Complexes 2 and 3 are resistant to photodegradation, and complex 2 has better photothermal conversion properties than 3.

Nucleophilic reaction of osmaarynes was used to obtain the corresponding pyreno[&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]osmium complexes (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) and peryleno[&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;] osmium complex (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), which exhibited near-infrared luminescence and aggregation-induced emission (AIE) properties. Complexes &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; are resistant to photodegradation, and complex &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; has better photothermal conversion properties than &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conjugation Extension and Halochromic Behaviors of S&#8208;Fused Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Bearing Cyclopenta[b]thiopyran Moieties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three S&#8208;fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) bearing cyclopenta[b]thiopyran moieties have been designed and successfully synthesized. With the conjugation extension, the absorption onset of the longest PAH reaches 1110 nm. All the three S&#8208;fused PAHs exhibit significant halochromic properties in both solution and solid states. Upon protonation, the proton is incorporated on the cyclopentadiene ring while the positive charge is localized on the thiopyrylium ring. Moreover, no significant difference can be found for the two shorter PAHs upon the protonation by different organic acids, such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH), while the longest PAH can be only mono&#8208;protonated by TFA but di&#8208;protonated by stronger TfOH. Furthermore, after protonation, the non&#8208;emissive S&#8208;fused PAHs exhibit strong fluorescence and can be regenerated by simply neutralization with triethylamine. The enhanced emission of mono&#8208;protonated products stem from S2&#8594;S0 transitions, which disobey the Kasha's rule.</dc:description>

         <title>Establishing Family Relations in Group 15 Halogenido Metalates with the Largest Molecular Antimony Iodide Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of five iodido antimonates with structurally very similar anions has been prepared, and the influence of the anion's size on the band gap and the presence of additional charge&#8208;transfer effects was investigated.







Abstract
Studying structurally related families of compounds is a valuable tool in understanding and predicting material properties and has been extensively used for metal halide perovskites. Due to the variable anion structures in group 15 halogenido metalates, similar family relations are still largely missing. Herein, we present compounds featuring the [Sb2nI6n+4]4&#8722; family of anions, including the first n=5 member in [Hpyz]4[Sb10I34] (Hpyz=pyrazinium), which contains the largest halogenido pentelate anion reported to date. The optical properties of compounds featuring n=1&#8211;5 anions show a clear trend as well as an outlier, a low band gap of 1.72&#8197;eV for [Hpyz]4[Sb10I34], that can be well understood using quantum chemical investigations. Also using SbI3 and [H2NMe2]3[SbI6], a compound featuring a single octahedral [SbI6]3&#8722; unit, as limiting cases, we show that structure&#8208;property relationships can be established in group 15 halogenido metalates in a similar way as in metal halide perovskites, thus providing a framework for understanding new and known compounds in this emerging class of materials.

         <title>Simultaneous Loading of Ni2P Cocatalysts on the Inner and Outer Surfaces of Mesopores P&#8208;Doped Carbon Nitride Hollow Spheres for Enhanced Photocatalytic Water&#8208;Splitting Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni2P cocatalysts were simultaneously loaded on the inner and outer surfaces of mesoporous P&#8208;doped carbon nitride hollow nanospheres to boost photocatalytic water splitting. The obtained Ni2P@PCNHS@Ni2P shows a significantly improved photocatalytic water splitting performance and enhanced atomic utilization. The findings guide the design of composite photocatalysts and the better utilization of hollow nanostructured semiconductors for photocatalysis.







Abstract
Promoting charge separation, constructing active sites, and improving the utilization of metal atoms are very important for the design of efficient photocatalysts. A simultaneous loading of Ni2P cocatalysts on the inner and outer surfaces of mesoporous P&#8208;doped carbon nitride hollow nanospheres (PCNHS) to construct a Ni2P@PCNHS@Ni2P photocatalyst is reported. Ni2P cocatalysts loading provides enough active sites on both the inner and outer surfaces for proton reduction, and the formed heterojunctions simultaneously promote the migration and separation of the photogenerated charges on the inner and outer surfaces. The photocatalytic reaction proceeds simultaneously on the inner and outer surfaces of Ni2P@PCNHS@Ni2P, which leads to a significantly improved photocatalytic water splitting performance and enhanced atomic utilization. Notably, the hydrogen evolution rate of Ni2P@PCNHS@Ni2P is 2.4 times higher than that of Pt&#8208;loaded PCNHS. The findings guide the design of hollow nanostructured composites with high&#8208;boosting photocatalytic performance.

Calcium hydride cation dimer catalysis: Dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT calculations reveal that the same double Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridged calcium hydride cation dimer catalyst [LCaH2CaL]2+&#8901;THF shows a novel substrate&#8208;dependent catalytic activity, involving cooperative Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridges for efficient H2 isotope exchange, terminal Ca&#8722;H bond for the Markovnikov addition of conjugation&#8208;activated styrene, and competitive Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridges and terminal Ca&#8722;H bonds for the anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition of unactivated 1&#8208;alkenes.







Abstract
Recently, it was shown that the double Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridged calcium hydride cation dimer complex [LCaH2CaL]2+ (macrocyclic ligand L=NNNN&#8208;tetradentate Me4TACD) exhibited remarkable activity in catalyzing the hydrogenation of unactivated 1&#8208;alkenes as well as the H2 isotope exchange under mild conditions, tentatively via the terminal Ca&#8722;H bond of cation monomer LCaH+. In this DFT mechanistic work, a novel substrate&#8208;dependent catalytic mechanism is disclosed involving cooperative Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridges for H2 isotope exchange, competitive Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridges and terminal Ca&#8722;H bonds for anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition of unactivated 1&#8208;alkenes, and terminal Ca&#8722;H bonds for Markovnikov addition of conjugation&#8208;activated styrene. THF&#8208;coordination plays a key role in favoring the anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition while strong cation&#8208;&#960; interactions direct the Markovnikov addition to terminal Ca&#8722;H bonds.

         <title>Inter&#8208;Network Charge&#8208;Transfer Excited State Formation Within a Two&#8208;fold Catenated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two electronically complementary linkers of the same framework are a well&#8208;studied pathway to achieve the photo&#8208;excited charge transfer state in a framework structure. Here, we show a mostly undiscovered strategy, how intercatenated metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) endows ground&#8208;state donor&#8208;acceptor interaction from two networks of the same framework to facilitate the inter&#8208;net charge&#8208;transfer excited state through direct photo&#8208;excitation rendering the possibility in the energy conversion scheme.







Abstract
Charge&#8208;transfer excited state (CTES) defines the ability to split photon energy into work producing redox equivalents suitable for photocatalysis. Here, we report inter&#8208;net CTES formation within a two&#8208;fold catenated crystalline metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), constructed with two linkers, N,N&#8242;&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenetetracarboxydiimide (DPNDI) and 2,6&#8208;dicarboxynaphthalene (NDC). The structural flexibility puts two complementary linkers from two nets in a proximal position to interact strongly. Supported by the electrochemical and steady&#8208;state electronic spectroscopic data, this ground&#8208;state interaction facilitates forming CTES that can be populated by direct excitation. We map the dynamics of the CTES which persists over a few nanoseconds and highlight the utilities of such relatively long&#8208;lived CTES as enhanced conductivity of the MOF under light over that measured in dark and as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;principle test, photo&#8208;reduction of methyl viologen under white light.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two electronically complementary linkers&lt;/b&gt; of the same framework are a well-studied pathway to achieve the photo-excited charge transfer state in a framework structure. Here, we show a mostly undiscovered strategy, how intercatenated metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) endows ground-state donor-acceptor interaction from two networks of the same framework to facilitate the inter-net charge-transfer excited state through direct photo-excitation rendering the possibility in the energy conversion scheme.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Resonant Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent (MR&#8208;TADF) Compounds as Photocatalysts
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) compounds, DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa, are shown to be excellent photocatalysts in a range of different reactions, benchmarked against the widely used donor&#8208;acceptor TADF photocatalyst, 4CzIPN. Advantages of using these MR&#8208;TADF photocatalysts include robust and inexpensive photocatalyst synthesis, lower required photocatalyst loadings and faster reaction rates, while achieving comparable or improved product yields.







Abstract
Donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) compounds, such as 4CzIPN, have become a widely used sub&#8208;class of organic photocatalysts for a plethora of photocatalytic reactions. Multi&#8208;resonant TADF (MR&#8208;TADF) compounds, a subclass of TADF emitters that are rigid nanographene derivatives, such as DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa, have to date not been explored as photocatalysts. In this study both DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa were found to give comparable or better product yield than 4CzIPN in a range of photocatalytic processes that rely upon reductive quenching, oxidative quenching, energy transfer and dual photocatalytic processes. In a model oxidative quench process, DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa gave increased reaction rates in comparison to 4CzIPN, with DiKTa being of particular interest due to the lower material cost (&#163;0.94/mmol) compared to that of 4CzIPN (&#163;3.26/mmol). These results suggest that DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa would be excellent additions to any chemist's collection of photocatalysts.

         <title>Neutral Boryl Radicals in Mixed&#8208;Valent B(III)Br&#8208;B(II) Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two neutral boryl radicals containing intramolecular mixed&#8208;valent B(II)Br&#8208;B(III) adducts were prepared by one&#8208;electron reduction of biphenylene and 9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene substituted haloboranes. The radical features a large spin density on the boron center and its stabilization is assisted by a weak B(III)Br&#8208;B(II) &#963; interaction.







Abstract
The general strategies to stabilize a boryl radical involve single electron delocalization by &#960;&#8208;system and the steric hinderance from bulky groups. Herein, a new class of boryl radicals is reported, with intramolecular mixed&#8208;valent B(III)Br&#8208;B(II) adducts ligated by a cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC). The radicals feature a large spin density on the boron center, which is ascertained by EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Structural and computational analyses revealed that the stability of radical species was assisted by the CAAC ligand and a weak but significant B(III)Br&#8208;B(II) interaction, suggesting a cooperative avenue for stabilization of boryl radicals. Two&#8208;electron reduction of these new boryl radicals provides C&#8722;H insertion products via a borylene intermediate.

         <title>Organic Crystals with Response to Multiple Stimuli: Mechanical Bending, Acid&#8208;Induced Bending and Heating&#8208;Induced Jumping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two polymorphs (Form O and Form R) of a Schiff base compound were found, which could respond reversibly to multiple stimuli (external force, acid, heat) by elastic bending, rolling and jumping.







Abstract
Multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive molecular crystals are attracting extensive attentions due to their potential as smart materials, such as molecular machines, actuators, and sensors. However, the task of giving a single crystal multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive properties remains extremely challenging. Herein, we found two polymorphs (Form O and Form R) of a Schiff base compound, which could respond to multiple stimuli (external force, acid, heat). Form O and Form R have different elastic deformability, which can be attributed to the differences in the molecular conformation, structural packing and intermolecular interactions. Moreover, both polymorphs exhibit reversible bending driven by volatile acid vapor, which we hypothesize is caused by reversible protonation reaction of imines with formic acid. In addition, jumping can be triggered by heating due to the significant anisotropic expansion. The integration of reversible bending and jumping into one single crystal expands the application scope of stimuli&#8208;responsive crystalline materials.

Messages from the cell: The cover picture honors the sensitivity of nitroxide labels combined with EPR spectroscopy in reporting on protein structure dynamics inside bacterial cells. We have demonstrated, in particular, that NarJ protein can be investigated at room temperature within 15&#8197;minutes, conditions that allow the preservation of both cell integrity and the activity of the protein under investigation.

         <title>Design Concepts for Solution and Solid&#8208;State Emitters &#8211; A Modern Viewpoint on Classical and Non&#8208;Classical Approaches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shine a light! This Minireview shines a light on potential design strategies for luminophores with efficient emission in solution and the solid state. These so&#8208;called solution and solid&#8208;state emitters (SSSE) can be regarded as interplaying phenomena between the classic effects of aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE). Hence, they feature remarkable and ideally environmentally insensitive photophysical properties and will for sure find wide&#8208;ranging applications in the near future.







Abstract
For a long time, luminescence phenomena were strictly distinguished between the emission of isolated molecules in dilute solutions or close&#8208;packed structures such as in powders or aggregates. This changed with the breakthrough observation of dual&#8208;state efficient materials, which led to a rapid boost of publications examining the influence of structural features to achieve balanced emission with disregarded molecular surroundings. Some first general structural design concepts have already been proposed based on reoccurring patterns and pivotal motifs. However, we have found another way to classify these solution and solid&#8208;state emitters (SSSEs).

     alt="Design Concepts for Solution and Solid-State Emitters &#8211; A Modern Viewpoint on Classical and Non-Classical Approaches"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shine a light&lt;/b&gt;! This Minireview shines a light on potential design strategies for luminophores with efficient emission in solution and the solid state. These so-called solution and solid-state emitters (SSSE) can be regarded as interplaying phenomena between the classic effects of aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) and aggregation-induced emission (AIE). Hence, they feature remarkable and ideally environmentally insensitive photophysical properties and will for sure find wide-ranging applications in the near future.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time, luminescence phenomena were strictly distinguished between the emission of isolated molecules in dilute solutions or close-packed structures such as in powders or aggregates. This changed with the breakthrough observation of dual-state efficient materials, which led to a rapid boost of publications examining the influence of structural features to achieve balanced emission with disregarded molecular surroundings. Some first general structural design concepts have already been proposed based on reoccurring patterns and pivotal motifs. However, we have found another way to classify these &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;olution and &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;olid-&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;tate &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;mitters (SSSEs). Hence, this minireview aims to present an overview of published structural features of SSSEs while shining light on design concepts from a more generalized perspective. Since SSSEs are believed to bridge the gap of hitherto known aggregation-sensitive compound classes, we hope to give future scientists a versatile tool in hand to efficiently design novel luminescent materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recognition&#8208;Induced Enhanced Emission of Core&#8208;Fluorescent ESIPT&#8208;type Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ESIPT&#8208;type resorcin[4]arenes are capable of guest&#8208;binding in the cavity and generate FL response with large Stokes shift and size&#8208;selective enhancement of emission via the mechanism that involves (a) selective di&#8208;deprotonation, (b) generation of emissive double keto tautomeric forms, and (c) recognition&#8208;induced restriction of intramolecular motion.







Abstract
Core&#8208;fluorescent cavitands based on 2&#8208;(2&#8242;&#8208;resorcinol)benzimidazole fluorophores (RBIs) merged with the resorcin[4]arene skeleton were designed and synthesized. The cavitands, due to the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonds and increased acidity, show excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and readily undergo deprotonation to form dianionic cavitands, capable of strong binding to organic cations. The changes in fluorescence are induced by deprotonation and binding events and involve huge Stokes shifts (due to emission from anionic double keto tautomers) and cation&#8208;selective enhancement of emission originating from the restriction of intramolecular motion (RIR) upon recognition in the cavity. Ab initio calculations indicate that the macrocyclic scaffold stabilizes the ground state tautomeric forms of the fluorophores that are not observed for non&#8208;macrocyclic analogs. In the excited state, the emitting forms for both macrocyclic scaffolds and non&#8208;macrocyclic analogs are anionic double keto tautomers, which are the result of excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) or excited state double proton transfer (ESDPT).

         <title>Interactive Bioconjugation at N&#8208;Terminal Cysteines by Using O&#8208;Salicylaldehyde Esters towards Dual Site&#8208;Selective Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;way protection: O&#8208;Salicylaldehyde esters are suitable handles for the site&#8208;specific protection of N&#8208;terminal cysteines on native peptides. The resulting phenolic thiazolidines present tunable stability through careful pH control that allows the orthogonal multifunctionalization of different Cys residues driven by interactive site&#8208;selective peptide modifications.







Abstract
N&#8208;terminal Cys modification has been intensively studied to produce homogeneous bioconjugates essentially through two modes of reaction: reversible modification with the equilibrium shifted towards the formation of the desired conjugate or stable and irreversible conjugates. Herein, we report a new method of N&#8208;terminal cysteine modification using O&#8208;salicylaldehyde esters (OSAEs) through fast conjugation and irreversible deconjugation. These reagents can rapidly react with N&#8208;terminal Cys at low&#8208;micromolar concentration to form thiazolidines with subsequent hydrolysis of the ester moiety to the phenolic derivative. These phenolic thiazolidines can be hydrolyzed at acidic pH (&#8776;4.5) to recover the intact N&#8208;terminal Cys. Bioconjugation reactions using OSAEs offer controlled reversibility to as act as a protecting group for N&#8208;terminal cysteines, allowing the modification of in&#8208;chain residues without perturbing the N&#8208;terminal Cys, which can then be deprotected and used as a conjugation site.

         <title>G&#8208;type Halohydrin Dehalogenases Catalyze Ring Opening Reactions of Cyclic Epoxides with Diverse Anionic Nucleophiles
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
G&#8208;type halohydrin dehalogenases convert 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered cyclic epoxides with a range of small anionic C&#8208;, N&#8208;, O&#8208; and S&#8208;nucleophiles.







Abstract
Halohydrin dehalogenases are promiscuous biocatalysts, which enable asymmetric ring opening reactions of epoxides with various anionic nucleophiles. However, despite the increasing interest in such asymmetric transformations, the substrate scope of G&#8208;type halohydrin dehalogenases toward cyclic epoxides has remained largely unexplored, even though this subfamily is the only one known to display activity with these sterically demanding substrates. Herein, we report on the exploration of the substrate scope of the two G&#8208;type halohydrin dehalogenases HheG and HheG2 and a newly identified, more thermostable member of the family, HheG3, with a variety of sterically demanding cyclic epoxides and anionic nucleophiles. This work shows that, in addition to azide and cyanide, these enzymes facilitate ring&#8208;opening reactions with cyanate, thiocyanate, formate, and nitrite, significantly expanding the known repertoire of accessible transformations.

         <title>Cobalt Cyclopentadienyl&#8208;Phosphine Dinitrogen Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By reducing cobalt chloride complexes under a dinitrogen atmosphere, cobalt dinitrogen complexes and binuclear cobalt tetra&#8208;dinitrogen complexes were formed. The cobalt dinitrogen complex could react with white phosphorus to afford a dinuclear cobalt complex bearing a cyclo&#8208;P4 moiety.







Abstract
By applying the potassium salts of cyclopentadienyl&#8208;phosphine ligands LK to CoCl2, the corresponding cobalt chlorides (1, LCoIICl) were prepared. By reducing complexes 1 with KHBEt3 under a N2 atmosphere, bridging end&#8208;on complexes, LCoI&#8722;N2&#8722;CoIL (2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b), were successfully obtained. 15N2&#8208;labeled [15N2]&#8208;2&#8201;a was prepared under 15N2/14N2 exchange in THF solution. LCoI&#8722;N2&#8722;CoIL complex 2&#8201;a could react with P4 molecules to release N2 and generate a Co&#8722;P4&#8722;Co moiety 4. Further reduction of complex 2&#8201;b led to cleavage of a P&#8722;C bond in the cyclopentadienyl&#8208;phosphine ligand to provide novel &#956;&#8208;PCy2&#8208;bridged Co0&#8722;N2 complex 5. DFT calculations confirmed the experimental observations.

         <title>Constructing Netlike Nanosheets of ZnO/BiOCl with Heterojunction as Robust Material for Electrochemical Amine Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnO/BiOCl heterojunction material is fabricated by constructing netlike ZnO and BiOCl nanosheets. It exhibits high selectivity to ammonia and detection limit is 0.25&#8197;&#956;M, which is suitable to detect volatile amines quantitatively. The synergetic effects of the heterojunction and netlike structures contribute to boosting electrochemical activity. The ZnO/BiOCl hybrid could be an promising candidate for detection and analysis.







Abstract
The electrochemical sensing is a potential method for detection of trace toxic substance. Herein, the heterojunction of netlike ZnO/BiOCl nanosheets was constructed for the enhanced electrochemical detection of ammonia. Cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry were used to investigate the electrochemical performance. The results show that the ZnO/BiOCl&#8208;modified electrode exhibits higher sensitivity towards ammonia compared with the ZnO and BiOCl&#8208;based electrodes, which is ascribed to band structure and fast electron transfer. The high response of 11.8&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;mM&#8722;1 and a low detection limit (LOD) of 0.25&#8197;&#956;M are achieved. In addition, the ZnO/BiOCl material exhibits high selectivity, repeatability and stability. The better linear relationship between concentration and current (R2=0.99) is significant for quantitative detection of ammonia, implying that netlike ZnO/BiOCl nanosheets can serve as electrochemical sensing platform for detecting toxic substance. This research provides a strategy for fabricating two&#8208;dimensional netlike materials and regulating heterojunctions used for electrochemical application.

         <title>Tuning the Photocatalytic Performance of Ruthenium(II) Polypyridine Complexes Via Ligand Modification for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Phosphorylation of Tertiary Aliphatic Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The redox potential of ruthenium(II) complexes were tuned with the aim to expand their applicability as photocatalyst for synthetic conversion. This resulted in an extended scope of the photoredox phosphorylation of tertiary aliphatic amines using a new ruthenium complex as photocatalyst.







Abstract
Tuning the redox potential of commonly available photocatalyst to improve the catalytic performance or expand its scope for challenging synthetic conversions is an ongoing demand in synthetic chemistry. Herein, the excited state properties and redox potential of commercially available [Ru(bpy)3]2+ photocatalyst were tuned by modifying the structure of the bipyridine ligands with electron&#8208;donating/withdrawing units. The visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated photoredox phosphorylation of tertiary aliphatic amines was demonstrated under mild conditions. A series of cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reactions were performed employing the RuII complexes as photocatalyst giving the corresponding &#945;&#8208;aminophosphinoxides and &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates via carbon&#8208;phosphorus (C&#8722;P) bond formation.

         <title>Continuous Charge Transport in Carbon Nitride Modulated by Interfacial Chemical Bond and Homophase Junction to Boost Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Motivated by the electron transport chain in natural photosynthesis, we propose a strategy to construct an electron transport channel in a model artificial photocatalyst, C3N4&#8722;TiO2 (BN&#8722;BR/CN) by electron transport layer engineering through a homophase junction (BN&#8722;BR). The electrons generated in CN under visible light can be contiunuously extracted and migrated along CN,BR TiO2, and BN TiO2, resulting in the synergistic optimization of photoabsorption and charge separation, and boosting H2 evolution. More information can be found in the Research Article by J. Zhang and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202007).

         <title>Placing CF2 in the Center: Major Physicochemical Changes Upon a Minor Structural Alteration in Gem&#8208;Difunctional Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine atoms play an important role in all branches of chemistry and accordingly, it is very important to study their unique and varied effects systematically, in particular, the structure&#8208;physicochemical properties relationship. The present study describes exceptional physicochemical effects resulting from a H/F exchange at the methylene bridge of gem&#8208;difunctional compounds. The &#916;log  P  (CF2&#8208;CH2)  values, i.e. the change in lipophilicity, observed for the CH  2  /CF  2  replacement in various &#945;,&#945;&#8208;phenoxy&#8208; and thiophenoxy&#8208;esters/amides, diketones, benzodioxoles and more, fall in the range of 0.6&#8208;1.4 units, which for most cases, is far above the values expected for such a replacement. Moreover, for compounds holding more than one such gem&#8208;difunctional moiety, the effect is nearly additive, so one can switch from a hydrophilic compound to a lipophilic one in a limited number of H/F exchanges. DFT studies of some of these systems revealed that polarity, conformational prference as well as charge distributions are strongly affected by such hydrogen to fluorine atom substitution. The pronounced effects described, are a result of the interplay between changes in polarity, H&#8208;bond basicity and molecular volume, which were obtained with a very low &#8216;cost&#8217; in terms of molecular weight or steric effects and may have a great potential for implementation in various fields of chemical sciences.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An oxidation reaction of hydroxyhomosumanene on silica gel providing homosumanene ortho &#8208;quinone and its synthetic application for azaacene&#8208;fused homosumanenes is described. Hydroxyhomosumanene is photochemically oxidized by air, when it is coated on silica gel; this aerobic oxidation proceeds faster than that of planar analogues. The difference of such reactivity was attributed to the unusual keto&#8208;enol tautomerization due to structural difference between planer and curved &#960;&#8208;system. The homosumanene ortho quinone was used in the synthesis of several azaacene&#8208;fused homosumanenes, azaacenohomosumanenes. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of the single crystals revealed their columnar stacking structures due to the interactions between each bowl.

         <title>Proton induced defect&#8208;rich vanadium oxides as reversible polysulfide conversion sites for high performance lithium sulfur battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) battery has attracted attentions due to its high theoretical energy density, natural abundance, and low cost. However, the diffusion of polysulfides decreases the utilization and further degrades the battery life. Herein, we successfully fabricated a defect&#8208;rich layered sodium vanadium oxide with proton doping (HNVO) nanobelt and it was utilized as the functional interface layer on separator in Li&#8208;S battery. Benefiting from the abundant defects of NVO and the catalytic activity of metal vanadium in electrochemical process, the shuttle of polysulfides was greatly decreased by reversible chemical adsorption. Besides, the extra graphene layer also contributes to accelerating the charge carrier at high current densities. Therefore, the Li&#8208;S battery with G@HNVO delivers a high capacity of 1494.8 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.2 C and a superior cycling stability over 700 cycles at 1 C. This work provides an effective strategy for designing the electrode/separator interface layer to achieve the high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;S battery.</dc:description>

This work provides an effective strategy for designing the electrode/separator interface layer to achieve the high-performance Li-S battery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Challenges and Opportunities of Transition Metal Oxides as Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a sustainable energy technology, electrocatalytic energy conversion and storage has become increasingly prominent. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) are the key steps in the industrial applications of energy conversion and storage. Compared to the widely used precious metal catalysts, less&#8208;noble transition metal oxides (TMOs) and TMO&#8208;like materials have attracted board attentions as electrocatalysts in the above reactions. In this concept, we summarize the challenges and opportunities of some typical TMOs in electrocatalysis, and modification strategies of TMOs as electrocatalysts are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Hypervalent Pentacoordinate Carbon Compounds bearing a 7&#8208;6&#8208;7&#8208;Ring Skeleton</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To stabilize SN2 transition state&#8208;like penta&#8208;coordinate carbon species, triaryl&#8208;substituted cationic carbon compounds bearing a moderately flexible 7&#8208;6&#8208;7&#8208;ring skeleton bearing sulfur donors were synthesized and characterized. Electronic effects of the para&#8208;substituents (R = Cl, F, H, CH3, SMe, OMe)&#160;the two equatorial aryl groups bound to the cationic central carbon were investigated systematically along with a planar bidentate thioxanthene derivative. X&#8208;ray analysis on their solid&#8208;state structures showed that the parent (R = H), chloro&#8208;, fluoro&#8208;, and methyl derivatives&#160;were tetracoordinate carbon (sulfonium) structures, while the pMeO&#160;and thioxanthenyl system&#160;were pentacoordinate carbocation structures. The Hammett substituent constants for the para substituents (&#963;p+) correlates well with the bonding in these compounds. The methylthio&#8208;derivative&#160;with intermediate Hammett substituent constants (p&#8208;MeS; &#963;p+=&#8208;0.60) showed a tetracooridnate solid&#8208;state structure, though solution UV&#8208;Vis properties suggested the presence of a penta&#8208;coordinate structure. These amount to the first unambiguous solution evidence to the hypervalent apical 3c&#8208;4e interactions in pentacoordinate carbon compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Roles that Organic Ammoniums Play on the Surface of the Perovskite Film: A&#160;Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although perovskites show excellent optoelectronic properties leading to unprecedented efficiency increases of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), their polycrystalline films present a number of defect states, especially concentrated on the surface, which seriously affects device efficiency and long&#8208;term stability. Numerous works have reported various organic ammonium salts (OASs) to reduce defect states on the surface of the perovskite film. However, diverse roles of OASs are proposed and a guideline for reasonably selecting an OAS to treat the perovskite film is still lacked. Herein, we summarize recent works regarding the surface treatment of the perovskite film with OASs and discuss various roles that OASs play. Furthermore, we reveal how key factors, including chemical environment of the perovskite surface, types of OASs, and annealing temperature, influence the roles of OASs. This review could provide clues for understanding working mechanisms of OASs and for selecting appropriate OASs to improve the PSC performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Reconstructured Electrocatalysts during Oxygen Evolution Reaction under Alkaline Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of electrocatalysts with high&#8208;efficiency and clear structure&#8208;activity relationship towards the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for the wide application of water electrolyzers. Recently, the dynamic reconstruction phenomenon of the catalysts&#8217; surface structures during the OER process has been discovered. With the help of various advanced ex situ and in situ characterization, it is demonstrated that such surface reconstruction could yield actual active species to catalyze the water oxidation process. However, the attention and studies of potential interaction between reconstructed species and substrate are lacking. This review summarizes the recent development of typical reconstructed electrocatalysts and the substrate effect. First, the advanced characterization for electrocatalytic reconstruction is briefly discussed. Then, typical reconstructed electrocatalysts are comprehensively summarized and the key role of substrate effects during the OER process is emphasized. Finally, the future challenges and perspectives of surface reconstructed catalysts for water electrolysis are discussed.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first bis(amidophenolato)phosphonium salts are prepared and fully characterized. The perfluorinated derivative represents the strongest monocationic phosphorus Lewis acid on the fluoride and hydride ion affinity scale isolable to date. This affinity enables new reactions, such as hydride abstraction from Et3SiH, the first phosphaalkoxylation of an alkyne or a phosphorous catalyzed intramolecular hydroarylation. All properties and reactions are scrutinized by theory and experiment. Substantial &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;acidity provides the required affinity for substrate activation, while phosphorous&#8208;ligand cooperativity substantially enriches the reactivity portfolio of phosphonium ions.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Factor Fluorogenicity of Tetrazine&#8208;Modified Cyanine&#8208;Styryl Dyes for Bioorthogonal Labelling of DNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>TTwo green fluorescent tetrazine&#8208;modified cyanine&#8208;styryl dyes were synthesized for bioorthogonal labelling of DNA by means of the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with inverse electron demand. With DNA as target biopolymer the fluorescence of these dyes is released by two factors: (i)&#160;sterically by their interaction with DNA, and (ii)&#160;structurally via the conjugated tetrazine as quencher moiety. As a result, the reaction with bicyclononyne&#8208;modified DNA is significantly accelerated up to &#8805;&#160;284,000&#160;M&#8208;1s&#8208;1, and the fluorescence turn&#8208;on is enhanced up to 560 by the two&#8208;factor fluorogenicity. These dyes are cell permeable even in low concentrations and undergo fluorogenic reactions with BCN&#8208;modified DNA in living HeLa cells. The two&#8208;factor fluorescence release improves the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio such that washing procedures prior to cell imaging are not needed, which is a great advantage for live cell imaging of DNA and RNA in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Erythrose and Threose: Carbonyl Migrations, Epimerizations, Aldol, and Oxidative Fragmentation Reactions Under Plausible Prebiotic Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prebiotic generation of sugars in the context of origins of life studies is of considerable interest. Among the important intramolecular processes of sugars are carbonyl migrations and accompanying epimerizations. Herein we describe the carbonyl migration&#8208;epimerization process occurring down the entire carbon chain of chirally pure d&#8208;tetroses sugars under mild conditions. Employing chirally pure 1&#8208;13C&#8208;erythrose, 4&#8208;13C&#8208;erythrose and 1&#8208;13C&#8208;threose, we (1) identify all the species formed as the carbonyl migrates down the four&#8208;carbon chain and (2) assess the rates associated with the production of each of these species. Competing aldol reactions and oxidative fragmentation processes were also observed. Further observations of self&#8208;condensation of glycolaldehyde mainly yielding 2&#8208;keto&#8208;hexoses (sorbose and tagatose) and tetrulose also provides a basis for understanding the effect of carbonyl migrations on the product distribution in plausible prebiotic scenarios.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation, Reactivity and Decomposition of Aryl Phospha&#8208;Enolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two lithium phospha&#8208;enolates [RP=C(Si i Pr3)OLi]2 were prepared by reaction of triisopropyl silyl phosphaethynolate,  i Pr3SiPCO, with aryl lithium reagents LiR (R = Mes: 1,3,5&#8208;trimethyl phenyl; or Mes*: 1,3,5,&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl phenyl). Monomer/dimer aggregation of the enolates can be modulated by addition of 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4. Substitution of lithium for a heavier alkali metal was achieved through initial formation of a silyl enol ether, followed by reaction with KO t Bu to form the corresponding potassium phospha&#8208;enolate [MesP=C(Si i Pr3)OK]2. On addition of water, the enolates are protonated to afford RP=C(Si i Pr3)(OH). For the sterically less demanding system (R = Mes), this phospha&#8208;enol rapidly tautomerises to the corresponding acyl phosphine MesP(H)C(Si i Pr 3 )(O), which on heating extrudes CO. In contrast, bulkier phospha&#8208;enol (R = Mes*) is stable to rearrangement at room temperature and thermally decomposes to RH and  i Pr3SiPCO.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable Production of Molybdenum Carbide (MXene) from Fruit Wastes for Improved Solar Evaporation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Freshwater production using solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation is considered to be a green and sustainable strategy. The biggest barrier to practical deployment of solar desalination, however, continues to be the lack of options for renewable materials. Herein, we present a simple two&#8208;step carbonization approach that is sustainable for developing innovative two&#8208;dimensional (2D) molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) materials derived&#160;from carbonized fruit wastes. The resultant 2D Mo2C photothermal layer has a high water evaporation rate of 1.52 kg m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 with a photothermal conversion efficiency of 94 % under one sun irradiation, which is among the best values reported thus far. The broad solar absorption band, high specific surface area (555.1 m2 g&#8208;1) with large micro&#8208; and meso porosity&#160;of the Mo2C&#160;photothermal layer are responsible for these outstanding results. The conversion of food wastes into valuable products, in this case MXene, can potentially inspire greener developments of advanced materials for solar water evaporator.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Vinylene&#8208;linked thiopyrylium&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were synthesized from 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate and other common reagents by means of acid&#8208;catalyzed Aldol condensation. Besides, pyrylium&#8208;, and pyridinium&#8208;based COFs also can be prepared from the same monomer under slightly different reaction conditions.







Abstract
The development of new vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with special ionic structure and high stability is challenging. Herein, we report a facile, general method for constructing ionic vinylene&#8208;linked thiopyrylium&#8208;based COFs from 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate and other common reagents by means of acid&#8208;catalyzed Aldol condensation. Besides, pyrylium&#8208;, and pyridinium&#8208;based COFs also can be prepared from the same monomer under slightly different reaction conditions. The COFs exhibited uniform nanofibrous morphologies with excellent crystallinities, special ionic structures, well&#8208;defined nanochannels, and high specific surface areas.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How 1H&#8208;detected fast MAS ssNMR spectroscopy can be applied for in&#8208;depth characterization of the Schizophyllum commune cell wall architecture and composition, as well as the elucidation of cell surface&#8208;level interactions.

Solid&#8208;state NMR (ssNMR) spectroscopy facilitates the non&#8208;destructive characterization of structurally heterogeneous biomolecules in their native setting, for example, comprising proteins, lipids and polysaccharides. Here we demonstrate the utility of high and ultra&#8208;high field 1H&#8208;detected fast MAS ssNMR spectroscopy, which exhibits increased sensitivity and spectral resolution, to further elucidate the atomic&#8208;level composition and structural arrangement of the cell wall of Schizophyllum commune, a mushroom&#8208;forming fungus from the Basidiomycota phylum. These advancements allowed us to reveal that Cu(II) ions and the antifungal peptide Cathelicidin&#8208;2 mainly bind to cell wall proteins at low concentrations while glucans are targeted at high metal ion concentrations. In addition, our data suggest the presence of polysaccharides containing N&#8208;acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc) and proteins, including the hydrophobin proteins SC3, shedding more light on the molecular make&#8208;up of cells wall as well as the positioning of the polypeptide layer. Obtaining such information may be of critical relevance for future research into fungi in material science and biomedical contexts.

Abstract
A three&#8208;component, solvent&#8208;dependent, Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction of benzaldehydes, silyl enolates and arene nucleophiles has been developed for the synthesis of potential drug candidate 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;indanones. This reaction features the formation of three C&#8722;C bonds, high regioselectivity in a one&#8208;pot strategy, broad substrate generality, facile scalability (1.04g), high functional group tolerance and viable substrates. The &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;silyl ethers generated in&#8208;situ from the Mukaiyama aldol reaction were subjected to acid&#8208;catalyzed benzylic arylation with strong as well as weak nucleophiles, and the resultant &#946;,&#946;&#8208;diaryl esters can undergo a third C&#8722;C bond formation with excellent regioselectivity through intramolecular cyclization to afford the indanone products in the same pot. Detailed mechanistic insight leads to a feasible reaction pathway. This transformation opens up a practical and adaptable approach to producing a variety of synthetically valuable transformations and enable the synthesis of medicinally valuable (R)&#8208;tolterodine and (+)&#8208;indatraline.

         <title>Stacking Interactions: A Supramolecular Approach to Upgrade Weak Halogen Bond Donors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Stacking interactions turn on halogen &#963;&#8208;hole in unactivated chloro&#8208; and bromo&#8208;arenes which are thus enabled to function as good halogen bonding donors.







Abstract
The co&#8208;crystallization of tetracyanobenzene (TCB) with haloarenes ArX provided six new co&#8208;crystals TCB&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ArX (ArX=PhCl, PhBr, 4&#8208;MeC6H4Cl, 4&#8208;MeC6H4Br, 4&#8208;MeOC6H4Cl, 1,2&#8208;Br2C6H4) which were studied by X&#8208;ray diffraction. In these systems, the strong collective effect of &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions and lone pair&#8208;(X)&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;&#8208;hole&#8208;(C) bondings between TCB and ArX promote the strength of X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ncyano halogen bonding (HaB). Theoretical studies showed that the stacking interactions affect the &#963;&#8208;hole depth of the haloarenes, thus significantly boosting their ability to function as HaB donors. According to the molecular electrostatic potential calculations, the &#963;&#8208; hole&#8208;(Cl) value (1.5&#8197;kcal/mol) in the haloarene 4&#8208;MeOC6H4Cl (featuring an electron&#8208;rich arene moiety and exhibiting very poor &#963;&#8208;hole&#8208;(Cl) ability) increases significantly in the stacked trimer (TCB)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4&#8208;MeOC6H4Cl (12.5&#8197;kcal/mol). Theoretical DFT calculations demonstrate the dramatic increase of X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ncyano HaB strength for stacked trimers in comparison with parent unstacked haloarenes.

         <title>Efficient Photoredox Cycles to Control Perylenediimide Self&#8208;Assembly
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoreduction can be used to disassemble perylenediimide&#8208;based supramolecular structures by creating repulsive dianions. Typically, photoreductions are done in oxygen&#8208;free conditions. Here we show that &#8216;indirect photoreduction&#8217; by acetone ketyl radicals is very efficient and can be done in open air. Repeated photoreduction/disassembly followed by oxidation/assembly cycles can in this way be performed by simple UV&#8722;C LED light.







Abstract
Photoreduction of perylenediimide (PDI) derivatives has been widely studied for use in photocatalysis, hydrogen evolution, photo&#8208;responsive gels, and organic semiconductors. Upon light irradiation, the radical anion (PDI&#8901;&#8722;) can readily be obtained, whereas further reduction to the dianion (PDI2&#8722;) is rare. Here we show that full 2&#8208;electron photoreduction can be achieved using UVC light: 1) in anaerobic conditions by &#8216;direct photoreduction&#8217; of PDI aggregates, or 2) by &#8216;indirect photoreduction&#8217; in aerobic conditions due to acetone ketyl radicals. The latter strategy is also efficient for other dyes, such as naphthalenediimide (NDI) and methylviologen (MV2+). Efficient photoreduction on the minute time&#8208;scale using simple LED light in aerobic conditions is attractive for use in dissipative light&#8208;driven systems and materials.

         <title>A Silicon&#8208;Stereogenic Silanol &#8208; 18O&#8208;Isotope Labeling and Stereogenic Probe Reveals Hidden Stereospecific Water Exchange Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silanols are important industrial building blocks for the functionalization of surfaces. In this research, one silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanol was selectively synthesized and analyzed. By using an innovative combination of this stereochemical probe and isotope labeling, a configurationally stable chiral silanol was studied, providing new insights into mechanistic studies.







Abstract
A silicon&#8208;stereogenic aminosilanol was isolated in excellent diastereomeric ratio and the absolute configuration was determined. The silanol is configurative and condensation stable in solution and shows stereoselective transformations with a clean stereospecific pathway in follow&#8208;up reactions, which leads to the isolation of a silicon&#8208;stereogenic zinc complex and siloxane compounds. Investigations with 18O&#8208;labelled water and mass spectrometry analysis revealed an otherwise hidden exchange of oxygen atoms of silanol and water in solution that proceeds with retention of the configuration at the silicon center. This novel combination of a stereochemical probe and isotopic labeling in a silicon&#8208;stereogenic compound opens new analytic possibilities to study stereochemical courses of reactions with the aid of chiral silanols mechanistically.

         <title>Systematic Modulation of Thiol Functionalities in Inexpensive Porous Polymers for Effective Mercury Removal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triple trickle trap: Mercury cations were captured by three thiol&#8208;modified porous polymers with precise sulfur content and chain length. Results show optimized binding with very high capacities and a unique hydrophobic/hydrophobic interplay with multidentate binding facilitates varying capture kinetics. Easily scaled up, these inexpensive solids could feasibly be used in cleaning mercury&#8208;laden water streams.







Abstract
Through accumulation, mercury contamination in aquatic systems still poses serious health risks despite the strict regulations on drinking water and industrial discharge. One effective strategy against this is adsorptive removal, in which a suitably functionalized porous material is added to water treatment protocols. Thiol (SH) group&#8208;grafted structures perform commendably; however, insufficient attention is paid to the cost, scalability, and reusability or how the arrangement of sulfur atoms could affect the HgII binding strength. We used an inexpensive and scalable porous covalent organic polymer (COP&#8208;130) to systematically introduce thiol functional groups with precise chain lengths and sulfur content. Thiol&#8208;functionalized COP&#8208;130 demonstrates enhanced wettability and excellent HgII uptake of up to 936&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1, with fast kinetics and exceptionally high selectivity. These Hg adsorbents are easily regenerated with HCl and can be used at least six times without loss of capacity even after treatment with strong acid, a rare performance in the domain of Hg&#8208;removal research.

         <title>Protonated Porphyrins: Bifunctional Catalysts for the Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of N&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;Oxazolidinones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 cycloaddition to N&#8208;alkyl aziridines was efficiently promoted by economic and easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize protonated forms of porphyrin ligands. The metal&#8208;free procedure does not require the addition of any Lewis base or additive and allows N&#8208;alkyl oxazolidinones to be obtained in high yields and regioselectivities. A catalytic mechanism for the procedure is proposed on the basis of a DFT study.







Abstract
The protonation of commercially available porphyrin ligands yields a class of bifunctional catalysts able to promote the synthesis of N&#8208;alkyl oxazolidinones by CO2 cycloaddition to corresponding aziridines. The catalytic system does not require the presence of any Lewis base or additive, and shows interesting features both in terms of cost effectiveness and eco&#8208;compatibility. The metal&#8208;free methodology is active even with a low catalytic loading of 1&#8201;% mol, and the chemical stability of the protonated porphyrin allowed it to be recycled three times without any decrease in performance. In addition, a DFT study was performed in order to suggest how a simple protonated porphyrin can mediate CO2 cycloaddition to aziridines to yield oxazolidinones.

         <title>Total Synthesis, Absolute Configuration, and Phytotoxic Activity of Foeniculoxin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Foeniculoxin is a major phytotoxin produced by Italian strains of Phomopsis foeniculi. The first total synthesis is described utilizing the ene reaction and Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction as key steps. The absolute configuration of the C6&#8217; was determined using chiral separation and advanced Mosher&#8217;s method. The phytotoxicity of the synthesized compound was demonstrated via syringe&#8208;based infiltration into Chenopodium album and Arabidopsis thaliana leaves. Synthetic foeniculoxin induced various defects in A. thaliana leaf cells before lesion formation, including protein leakage into the cytoplasm from both chloroplasts and mitochondria and mitochondrial rounding and swelling. Furthermore, foeniculoxin and the antibiotic hygromycin B caused similar agglomeration of mitochondria around chloroplasts, highlighting this event as a common component in the early stages of plant cell death.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Spirobifluorene Core Based Hole Transporters with High Mobility for Long&#8208;Life Green Phosphorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green phosphorescent OLED with a high external quantum efficiency of 22&#8201;% and a long lifetime (LT50) of 89,000&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 has been successfully developed by a spirobifluorene&#8208;based multifunctional hole transporter referred to as TDBFSBF1.







Abstract
Using a tailored high triplet energy hole transport layer (HTL) is a suitable way to improve the efficiency and extend the lifetime of organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs), which can use all molecular excitons of singlets and triplets. In this study, dibenzofuran (DBF)&#8208;end&#8208;capped and spirobifluorene (SBF) core&#8208;based HTLs referred as TDBFSBF1 and TDBFSBF2 were effectively developed. TDBFSBF1 exhibited a high glass transition temperature of 178&#8201;&#176;C and triplet energy of 2.5&#8197;eV. Moreover, a high external quantum efficiency of 22.0&#8201;%, long operational lifetime at 50&#8201;% of the initial luminance of 89,000&#8197;h, and low driving voltage at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 of 2.95&#8197;V were achieved in green phosphorescent OLEDs using TDBFSBF1. Further, a high&#8208;hole mobility &#956;h value of 1.9&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 was recorded in TDBFSBF2. A multiscale simulation successfully reproduced the experimental &#956;h values and indicated that the reorganization energy was the primary factor in determining the mobility differences among these SBF core based HTLs.

         <title>Siderophore&#8208;linked Ruthenium Catalysts for Targeted Allyl Ester Prodrug Activation within Bacterial Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to rising resistance, new antibacterial strategies are needed, including methods for targeted antibiotic release. As targeting vectors, chelating molecules released by bacteria to acquire iron called siderophores have been investigated for conjugation to antibacterials, leading to the clinically&#8208;approved drug cefiderocol. The use of small&#8208;molecule catalysts for prodrug activation within cells has shown promise in recent years, and here we investigate siderophore&#8208;linked ruthenium catalysts for the activation of antibacterial prodrugs within cells. Moxifloxacin&#8208;based prodrugs were synthesised and their catalyst&#8208;mediated activation was demonstrated under anaerobic, biologically&#8208;relevant conditions. In the absence of catalyst, decreased antibacterial activities were observed compared to moxifloxacin versus&#160;Escherichia coli K12 (BW25113). A series of siderophore&#8208;linked ruthenium catalysts were investigated for prodrug activation, all of which displayed a combinative antibacterial effect with the prodrug, whilst a representative example displayed little toxicity against mammalian cell lines. By employing complementary bacterial growth assays, conjugates containing siderophore units based on catechol and azotochelin were found to be most promising for intracellular prodrug activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Perfluoroalkylvinylation of Alkenes Enabled by Dual DBU/Fe Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This manuscript demonstrates a simple and efficient strategy that involves dual DBU/iron&#8208;catalyzed alkene perfluoroalkylvinylation using perfluoroalkyl iodides and 2aminonaphthalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones as coupling partners. In terms of the developed catalytic system, various styrenes and aliphatic alkenes are well&#8208;tolerated, leading to the accurate preparation of perfluoroalkyl&#8208;containing 2&#8208;aminonaphthalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones in excellent regioselectivity. Moreover, the protocol can be readily applied in late&#8208;stage modifications of natural products and pharmaceuticals. The title reactions are featured by easily accessible and inexpensive catalysts and substrates, broad substrate applicability, and mild reaction conditions. Mechanistic investigations reveal a tandem C&#8208;I cleavable alkylation and C&#8208;C vinylation enabled by cooperative DBU/iron catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalysts as Key Enablers for the Synthesis of Bioplastics with Sophisticated Architectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly active and selective catalysts pave the way for the production of bioplastics with tailor&#8208;made properties. Comonomers can be used to alter the properties of the prominent bioplastic PLA. Besides the variation in the microstructure, a treasure not yet fully uncovered lies within the combination of different monomer classes in multimechanistic polymerizations.







Abstract
Bioplastics are one of the answers to environmental pollution and linear material flows. The most promising bioplastic polylactide (PLA) is already replacing conventional plastics in a number of applications. The properties of PLA, however, do not fit for all potential application areas, but they can be altered by the introduction of comonomers. The copolymerization of lactide (LA) with other lactones like &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone (CL) has been established for several years. Nevertheless, controlling copolymerizations remains a challenge due to the high complexity of the system. Copolymerization of LA with other monomer classes is much less investigated, but has the chance to overcome the limitations in material properties that occur when only lactones are used. The crucial factor for all copolymerizations is the catalyst. It dominates the reaction kinetics and determines the resulting microstructure. In this review, copolymerization catalysts for LA are presented divided into catalysts for the synthesis of lactone block copolymers, lactone random copolymers, and multimechanistically synthesized copolymers. The selected catalysts are highlighted either owing to their industrially applicable polymerization conditions or their non&#8208;standard mechanism.

         <title>Structure&#8211;Property Relationship of Cyano&#8208;Functionalized Conjugated Polymers for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalysis: The increase in the degree of CN functionalization can regulate the D&#8208;A interaction with beneficial effects, such as broadened light absorption range, improved charge separation, enhanced interaction with Pt cocatalyst, and strengthened hydrophilicity, which achieves an excellent activity in the photocatalytic hydrogen production reaction.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers (CPs) have garnered increasing attention in the field of photocatalysis due to their stability and molecular tunability. Understanding the structure&#8211;property relationship in CPs and addressing appropriate molecular design strategies are pivotal to improving the photocatalytic performance of CPs. Herein, a new efficient cyano (CN) engineering approach was proposed to promote the photocatalytic performance of CPs, and three representative CP&#8208;based photocatalysts with different CN contents were tailor&#8208;made to investigate the relationship between CN functionalization and photocatalytic activity. A series of systematically experimental and theoretical studies reveal that CN functionalization contributes to strengthening the donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) interaction, enhancing the light absorption ability, charge separation/transfer efficiency, and hydrophilicity of CPs, and also facilitating the output of separated photoinduced electrons from CPs to Pt cocatalyst. Thus, the dicyano&#8208;functionalized polymer (P&#8208;2CN) manifests an attractive photocatalytic performance in hydrogen production. This study provides a facile strategy to develop excellent CP&#8208;based photocatalysts for solar fuel production.

         <title>Investigating the Active Oxidants Involved in Cytochrome P450 Catalyzed Sulfoxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering peroxygenase activity into a P450 monooxygenase through mutations of the oxygen activation machinery resulted in a higher activity towards sulfoxidation than O&#8208;demethylation compared to the WT enzyme. This implies the existence of a second oxidant capable of catalyzing sulfoxidation which is proposed to be the Fe(III)&#8208;H2O2 complex as proposed in theoretical work by Shaik.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) heme&#8208;thiolate monooxygenases catalyze the hydroxylation of the C&#8722;H bonds of organic molecules. This reaction is initiated by a ferryl&#8208;oxo heme radical cation (Cpd I). These enzymes can also catalyze sulfoxidation reactions and the ferric&#8208;hydroperoxy complex (Cpd 0) and the Fe(III)&#8208;H2O2 complex have been proposed as alternative oxidants for this transformation. To investigate this, the oxidation of 4&#8208;alkylthiobenzoic acids and 4&#8208;methoxybenzoic acid by the CYP199A4 enzyme from Rhodopseudomonas palustris HaA2 was compared using both monooxygenase and peroxygenase pathways. By examining mutants at the mechanistically important, conserved acid alcohol&#8208;pair (D251N, T252A and T252E) the relative amounts of the reactive intermediates that would form in these reactions were disturbed. Substrate binding and X&#8208;ray crystal structures helped to understand changes in the activity and enabled an attempt to evaluate whether multiple oxidants can participate in these reactions. In peroxygenase reactions the T252E mutant had higher activity towards sulfoxidation than O&#8208;demethylation but in the monooxygenase reactions with the WT enzyme the activity of both reactions was similar. The peroxygenase activity of the T252A mutant was greater for sulfoxidation reactions than the WT enzyme, which is the reverse of the activity changes observed for O&#8208;demethylation. The monooxygenase activity and coupling efficiency of sulfoxidation and oxidative demethylation were reduced by similar degrees with the T252A mutant. These observations infer that while Cpd I is required for O&#8208;dealkylation, another oxidant may contribute to sulfoxidation. Based on the activity of the CYP199A4 mutants it is proposed that this is the Fe(III)&#8208;H2O2 complex which would be more abundant in the peroxide&#8208;driven reactions.

         <title>Accumulation of Four Electrons on a Terphenyl (Bis)disulfide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge accumulation is relevant for applications in solar energy conversion. Here, we present an electron acceptor that is able to store up to four electrons by taking advantage of the uncommon phenomenon of potential inversion.







Abstract
The activation of N2, CO2 or H2O to energy&#8208;rich products relies on multi&#8208;electron transfer reactions, and consequently it seems desirable to understand the basics of light&#8208;driven accumulation of multiple redox equivalents. Most of the previously reported molecular acceptors merely allow the storage of up to two electrons. We report on a terphenyl compound including two disulfide bridges, which undergoes four&#8208;electron reduction in two separate electrochemical steps, aided by a combination of potential compression and inversion. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation using the organic super&#8208;electron donor tetrakis(dimethylamino)ethylene, a cascade of light&#8208;induced reaction steps is observed, leading to the cleavage of both disulfide bonds. Whereas one of them undergoes extrusion of sulfur to result in a thiophene, the other disulfide is converted to a dithiolate. These insights seem relevant to enhance the current fundamental understanding of photochemical energy storage.

         <dc:description>
In this study, we investigated pnictogen&#8208;bridged diphenyl sulfones as a new class of luminophores with photoinduced dynamic rearrangement. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed that their emission dynamics could be ascribed to the photoinduced Pn&#8722;bond formation between a lone O pair in the sulfonyl moiety and the antibonding orbital of the Pn&#8722;C bond.







Abstract
In this study, pnictogen (Pn)&#8208;bridged diphenyl sulfones were synthesized as motifs for photoinduced dynamic rearrangement. The newly synthesized sulfones exhibited dual fluorescence at 298&#8197;K. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the longer&#8208;wavelength fluorescence was derived from the geometries after structural relaxation through photo&#8208;driven pnictogen bond formation between the O atom lone pair of the sulfonyl moiety and the antibonding orbital of the Pn&#8722;C bond. This is the first report on emission dynamics driven by pnictogen bond formation upon photoexcitation.

At the current stage, the key issues concern further improvements in efficiency and operational lifetime. Constructing a self&#8208;assembled perovskite structure with manipulated chemical and physical properties is a useful and effective strategy to solve these problems.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel coordination polymers embedding electroactive moieties present a high interest in the development of porous conducting materials. While tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) based metal&#8208;organic frameworks were reported to yield through&#8208;space conducting frameworks, the use of S&#8208;enriched scaffolds remains elusive in this field. Herein is reported the employment of bis(vinylenedithio)&#8208;tetrathiafulvalene (BVDT&#8208;TTF) functionalized with pyridine coordinating moieties in coordination polymers. Its combination with various transition metals yielded four isostructural networks, whose conductivity increased upon chemical oxidation with iodine. The oxidation was confirmed in a single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiment for the Cd(II) complex. Raman spectroscopy measurements and DFT calculations confirmed the oxidation state of the bulk materials, and band structure calculations assessed the ground state as an electronically localized antiferromagnetic state, while the conduction occurs in a 2D manner. These results are shedding light to comprehend how to improve through&#8208;space conductivity thanks to sulfur enriched ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoconvergent Synthesis of Z&#8208;1,3&#8208;Disubstituted&#8208;1,3&#8208;Dienes by Uphill Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isomeric mixtures of 1,3&#8208;dienes were selectively isomerized to their Z&#8208;isomers by uphill photocatalysis using blue LEDs and a catalytic amount of Ru(bpy)32+(PF6&#8722;)2 as the triplet sensitizer. It proved possible to directly convert alkyne and 1&#8208;alkene to Z&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes by a one&#8208;pot procedure, offering a practical approach to Z&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes which cannot be made directly by ene&#8208;yne metathesis.







Abstract
A variety of 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes were isomerized from E to Z isomers by photocatalysis using Ru(bpy)3[PF6]2 and blue LED light. Enrichment of the Z&#8208;isomer is thought to occur by selective triplet energy transfer from the photocatalyst to the stereoisomeric mixture. The 1,3&#8208;diene starting materials are easily made by catalytic ene&#8208;yne metathesis (EYM). To access 1,3&#8208;diene Z&#8208;stereoisomers directly, a one pot procedure was developed. Additional 1,3&#8208;dienes were investigated for both isomerization and Z&#8208;enrichment. The combination of cross EYM with photocatalysis allows for the stereoconvergent synthesis of Z&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes.

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics of RGO&#8208;Wrapped CNF/GO Aerogels with Controlled Pore Structures by PVA&#8208;Assisted Freeze&#8208;Casting Approach for Efficient Sound and Microwave Absorption
</title>

         <dc:description>
A polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)&#8208;assisted freeze&#8208;casting is developed for controllably fabricating reduced graphene oxide wrapped&#8208;carbon nanofiber (RGO@CNF)/graphene oxide composite aerogel. Due to the modulation of the pore size and composition, the resultant aerogel demonstrated an improved sound absorption property, especially at low frequencies. Moreover, the sample exhibits good microwave absorption performance and cyclic loading stability.







Abstract
Acoustic absorption materials play an important role in eliminating the negative effects of noise. Herein, a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)&#8208;assisted freeze&#8208;casting was developed for controllably fabricating reduced graphene oxide wrapped carbon nanofiber (RGO@CNF)/graphene oxide composite aerogel. During the freeze&#8208;casting, PVA was used as an icing inhibitor to control the size of ice crystals. While the concentration of PVA increased from 0 to 15&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ml&#8722;1, the average pore size of the aerogel was reduced from 154 to 45&#8197;&#956;m. Due to the modulation of the pore size and composition, the propagation path and friction loss for sound were optimized, especially at low frequency. For instance, the normalized sound absorption coefficient of RGO@CNF/GO&#8208;10 achieves 0.79 (250&#8211;6300&#8197;Hz). The sample also exhibits a desirable microwave absorbing property whose maximum reflection loss is &#8722;47.3&#8197;dB (9.44 GHz, d=3.0&#8197;mm). Prospectively, this synthetic strategy can be extended to develop other forms of elastic aerogel with a controlled pore size.

         <title>&#963;&#8208;Holes in Iodonium Ylides: Halogen&#8208;Bond Activation of Carboxylic Acids, Phenols and Thiophenols May Enable Their X&#8722;H Insertion Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational analysis revealed iodonium ylides to possess two &#963;&#8208;holes of differing potentials, situated along the extensions of their C&#8722;I bonds. Experimentation revealed that formal O&#8722;H or S&#8722;H insertion reactions were possible with carboxylic acids, phenols and thiophenols. Halogen&#8208;bond activation is presumed to be essential, resulting in &#945;&#8208;substituted&#8208;&#946;&#8208;dicarbonyls in 64&#8201;%&#8211;99&#8201;% yield in five minutes.







Abstract
The first systematic evaluation of the electrostatic potential energy maps of iodonium ylides was conducted. We determined that they possess two &#963;&#8208;holes of differing electron deficiencies, with the more electropositive &#963;&#8208;hole located opposite the dative I&#8722;C bond to the &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyl motif, and the lesser electropositive &#963;&#8208;hole located opposite the iodoarene C&#8722;I bond. We also conducted the first systematic evaluation of carboxylic acids, phenols and thiophenols in the O/S&#8208;alkylation reaction of iodonium ylides. While carboxylic acids and thiophenols were found to be generally viable, only phenols possessing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents were effective. This high&#8208;yielding and highly chemoselective reaction is believed to involve halogen&#8208;bond activation of heteroatoms, and nicely complements existing diazo&#8208;based methods for alkylation of acidic functional groups.

We determined that they possess two &#963;-holes of differing electron deficiencies, with the more electropositive &#963;-hole located opposite the dative I&#8722;C bond to the &#946;-dicarbonyl motif, and the lesser electropositive &#963;-hole located opposite the iodoarene C&#8722;I bond. We also conducted the first systematic evaluation of carboxylic acids, phenols and thiophenols in the O/S-alkylation reaction of iodonium ylides. While carboxylic acids and thiophenols were found to be generally viable, only phenols possessing electron-withdrawing substituents were effective. This high-yielding and highly chemoselective reaction is believed to involve halogen-bond activation of heteroatoms, and nicely complements existing diazo-based methods for alkylation of acidic functional groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cluster&#8208;Based Crystalline Materials for Iodine Capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cluster&#8208;based crystalline materials play an important role in the field of iodine host&#8208;guest chemistry. This review summarizes the recent progress of different types of cluster&#8208;based materials (such as cluster&#8208;based MOFs with different cluster nodes, metal&#8208;organic cages, macrocyclic molecules, and cluster composites) for iodine capture. The research status, possible iodine capture mechanisms and prospects of such crystalline materials are discussed.







Abstract
The treatment of radioactive iodine in nuclear waste has always been a critical issue of social concern. The rational design of targeted and efficient capture materials is of great significance to the sustainable development of the ecological environment. In recent decades, crystalline materials have served as a molecular platform to study the binding process and capture mechanism of iodine molecules, enabling people to understand the interaction between radioactive iodine guests and pores intuitively. Cluster&#8208;based crystalline materials, including molecular clusters and cluster&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks, are emerging candidates for iodine capture due to their aggregative binding sites, precise structural information, tunable pores/packing patterns, and abundant modifications. Herein, recent progress of different types of cluster materials and cluster&#8208;dominated metal&#8208;organic porous materials for iodine capture is reviewed. Research prospects, design strategies to improve the affinity for iodine and possible capture mechanisms are discussed.

         <title>Small Molecule Tools to Study Cellular Target Engagement for the Intracellular Allosteric Binding Site of GPCRs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A druggable intracellular allosteric binding site (IABS) has recently been identified at several GPCRs. Ligands targeting the IABS are promising drugs and currently evaluated in several clinical trials. Herein, we review small molecule tools that enable an unambiguous identification and characterization of cellular target engagement for intracellular allosteric GPCR ligands.







Abstract
A conserved intracellular allosteric binding site (IABS) has recently been identified at several G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs). Ligands targeting the IABS, so&#8208;called intracellular allosteric antagonists, are highly promising compounds for pharmaceutical intervention and currently evaluated in several clinical trials. Beside co&#8208;crystal structures that laid the foundation for the structure&#8208;based development of intracellular allosteric GPCR antagonists, small molecule tools that enable an unambiguous identification and characterization of intracellular allosteric GPCR ligands are of utmost importance for drug discovery campaigns in this field. Herein, we discuss recent approaches that leverage cellular target engagement studies for the IABS and thus play a critical role in the evaluation of IABS&#8208;targeted ligands as potential therapeutic agents.

         <title>Introduction of Ferrocene as a Facilitator for the Construction of Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferrocene assistant: The central ferrocene unit facilitates the designed monomer (1,n&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted ferrocene&#8208;azobenzene&#8208;long alkyl chains) to form supramolecular polymer (SP) by supporting higher enthalpy gain. The restricted rotational flexibility of ferrocene allows two azobenzene&#8208;dendritic arms to rotate freely, generating the best possible molecular conformation required for effective intermolecular interactions towards SP formation.







Abstract
Proper monomer design is the key to enhancing the strength of noncovalent interactions between the molecules toward the efficient formation of supramolecular polymers (SPs). We have designed and synthesized 1,n&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted ferrocene&#8208;azobenzene&#8208;long alkyl chains, Fc(CONH&#8208;Azo&#8208;TDP)2, to afford SPs with a high probability. The design exploits the &#8216;&#8216;molecular ball&#8208;bearing&#8217;&#8217; property of the ferrocene core, which allows two azobenzene arms to rotate in the planes of cyclopentadienyl rings, generating the most suitable molecular conformation required for SP formation. This ferrocene monomer formed a supergel consisting of SPs supported by strong intermolecular (H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking) interactions and higher enthalpy gain than the reference molecules, where the central ferrocene core was replaced by flexible aliphatic as well as rigid benzene linkers. The molecular conformation involved in SPs, the strength of noncovalent interactions, and the process of supramolecular polymerization were investigated through NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, XRD and TEM studies. The results demonstrate that ferrocene may act as a good modulator for constructing efficient SPs.
