         <title>Highly Sensitive &#8220;Off/On&#8221; EPR Probes to Monitor Enzymatic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study are reported two off/on EPR probes containing a nitroxide radical to study the enzymatic activity of carboxylesterases. Thanks to their low solubility in water, they aggregate to form stable micelles, which makes the probes EPR silent. In presence of the esterases enzymes the nitroxide radicals are release from the micelle giving an off/on transition and intense signal.







Abstract
The assessment of unregulated level of enzyme activity is a crucial parameter for early diagnoses in a wide range of pathologies. In this study, we propose the use of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) as an easy method to probe carboxylesterase (CE) enzymatic activity in&#8197;vitro. For this application, were synthesized two amphiphilic, nitroxide containing esters, namely Tempo&#8208;C12 (T&#8208;C12) and Tempo&#8208;2&#8208;C12 (T&#8208;2&#8208;C12). They exhibit low solubility in water and form stable micelles in which the radicals are EPR almost silent, but the hydrolysis of the ester bond yields narrows and intense EPR signals. The intensity of the EPR signals is proportional to the enzymatic activity. CEs1, CEs2 and esterase from porcine liver (PLE) were investigated. The obtained results show that T&#8208;C12 and T&#8208;2&#8208;C12&#8208;containing systems display a much higher selectivity toward the CEs2, with a Limit of Detection of the same order of those ones obtained with optical methods.

         <title>Femtosecond Spectroscopy and Nonlinear Optical Properties of aza&#8208;BODIPY Derivatives in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fast relaxation processes in the excited electronic states of functionalized aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (aza&#8208;BODIPY) derivatives were investigated in liquid media at room temperature, including the linear photophysical, photochemical, and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties.







Abstract
The fast relaxation processes in the excited electronic states of functionalized aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (aza&#8208;BODIPY) derivatives (1&#8211;4) were investigated in liquid media at room temperature, including the linear photophysical, photochemical, and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. Optical gain was revealed for nonfluorescent derivatives 3 and 4 in the near infrared (NIR) spectral range under femtosecond excitation. The values of two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) and excited&#8208;state absorption (ESA) cross&#8208;sections were obtained for 1&#8211;4 in dichloromethane using femtosecond Z&#8208;scans, and the role of bromine substituents in the molecular structures of 2 and 4 is discussed. The nature of the excited states involved in electronic transitions of these dyes was investigated using quantum&#8208;chemical TD&#8208;DFT calculations, and the obtained spectral parameters are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data. Significant 2PA (maxima cross&#8208;sections &#8764;2000&#8197;GM), and large ESA cross&#8208;sections &#8764;10&#8722;20&#8197;m2 of these new aza&#8208;BODIPY derivatives 1&#8211;4 along with their measured high photostability reveal their potential for photonic applications in general and optical limiting in particular.

         <title>Tribo&#8208;Excited Chemical Reaction Using an EuIII Complex with a Stacked Anthracene Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tribo&#8208;excitation in a crystalline compound is an interesting phenomenon in which a mechanical stimulus drives the compound to its excited state. We demonstrate a tribo&#8208;excited chemical reaction using trivalent europium (EuIII) and gadolinium (GdIII) complexes with stacked anthracene ligands for the development of tribo&#8208;excitation chemistry. The tribo&#8208;oxidation and &#8208;dimerization reactions in the stacked anthracene ligands occur in the EuIII and GdIII complexes, respectively. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y.&#8197;Kitagawa, Y.&#8197;Hasegawa et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104401).

         <title>Foldable detergents&#160;for membrane protein study: Importance of detergent core flexibility in protein stabilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane proteins are of biological and pharmaceutical significance. However, their structural study is extremely challenging mainly due to the fact that only a small number of chemical tools is suitable for stabilizing membrane proteins in solution. Detergents are widely used in membrane protein study, but conventional detergents are generally poor at stabilizing challenging membrane proteins such as G protein&#8208;coupled receptors and protein complexes. In the current study, we prepared tandem triazine&#8208;based maltosides (TZMs) with two amphiphilic triazine units connected by different diamine linkers, hydrazine (TZM&#8208;Hs) and 1,2&#8208;ethylenediamine (TZM&#8208;Es). These TZMs were consistently superior to a gold standard detergent (DDM) in terms of stabilizing a few membrane proteins. In addition, the TZM&#8208;Es containing a long linker showed more general protein stabilization efficacy with multiple membrane proteins than the TZM&#8208;Hs containing a short linker. This result indicates that introduction of the flexible1,2&#8208;ethylenediamine linker between two rigid triazine rings enables the TZM&#8208;Es to fold into favourable conformations in order to promote membrane protein stability. The novel concept of detergent foldability introduced in the current study has potential use for rational detergent design and membrane protein applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Suberitines A&#8208;D Featuring Tunable Biomimetic Late&#8208;Stage Oxidative Dearomatization and Acetalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aaptaminoids are a unique family of marine alkaloids bearing a benzo[  de  ][1,6]&#8208;naphthyridine core. This work describes the first total synthesis of suberitines A&#8208;D (  1  &#8208;  4  ), four typical dimeric natural aaptaminoids, employing a step&#8208;saving bidirectional strategy. Key methods applied in the total synthesis include a cationic cascade to construct the bis&#8208;isoquinoline(s) with Hendrickson reagent&#8208;mediated Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type cyclization and eliminative aromatization, and a Bronsted acid&#8208;promoted Vilsmeier cyclization to generate the naphthyridine(s). The conditionally tunable PIDA&#8208;mediated oxidative dearomatization and subsequent methanolysis or hydrolysis successfully served as a powerful biomimetic tool to elaborate the essential oxygenated functionalities of suberitines A&#8208;D (  1&#8208;4  ) in proper solvent&#8208;combinations at the final stage of total synthesis. The biomimetic proposal employed in the late&#8208;stage redox interchanges of related natural products was eventually supported by the isolation of synthetic intermediate  23a  as a natural product from the same natural source. Biological screening revealed that five of the synthetic samples including two natural suberitines and three full&#8208;skeleton natural product&#8208;like intermediates exhibited low micromolar inhibitory activities against the growth of cancer cell line K562.</dc:description>

The biomimetic proposal employed in the late-stage redox interchanges of related natural products was eventually supported by the isolation of synthetic intermediate  23a  as a natural product from the same natural source. Biological screening revealed that five of the synthetic samples including two natural suberitines and three full-skeleton natural product-like intermediates exhibited low micromolar inhibitory activities against the growth of cancer cell line K562.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quantum Chemistry&#8208;based Molecular Dynamics Simulations as a Tool for the Assignment of ESI&#8208;MS/MS Spectra of Drug Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In organic mass spectrometry, fragment ions provide important information on the analyte as a central part of its structure elucidation. With increasing molecular size and possible protonation sites, the potential energy surface (PES) of the analyte can become very complex, which results in a large number of possible fragmentation patterns. Quantum chemical (QC) calculations can help here, enabling the fast calculation of the PES and thus enhancing the mass spectrometry&#8208;based structure elucidation processes. In this work, the previously unknown fragmentation pathways of the two drug molecules Nateglinide (45 atoms) and Zopiclone (51 atoms) were investigated using a combination of&#160;generic formalisms and calculations conducted with the Quantum Chemical Mass Spectrometry (QCxMS) program. The computations of the de novo fragment spectra were conducted with the semi&#8208;empirical GFNn&#8208;xTB (n = 1, 2) methods and compared against Orbitrap measured electrospray ionization (ESI) spectra in positive ion mode. It was found that the unbiased QC calculations are particularly suitable to predict non&#8208;evident fragment ion structures, sometimes contrasting the accepted generic formulation of fragment ion structures from electron migration rules, where the "true" ion fragment structures are approximated. For the first time, all fragment and intermediate structures of these large&#8208;sized&#160;molecules could be elucidated completely and routinely using this merger of methods, finding new&#160;undocumented mechanisms, that are not considered in common rules published so far. Given the importance of ESI for medicinal chemistry, pharmacokinetics, and metabolomics, this approach can significantly enhance the mass spectrometry&#8208;based structure elucidation processes and contribute to the understanding of previously unknown fragmentation pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Elaborated Reaction Pathway of Photothermal Catalytic CO2 Conversion with H2O on Gallium Oxide Decorating and Defective Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, Ga  2  O  3  &#8208;decorated and defective surface models based on anatase TiO  2  were established. The thermodynamic reaction pathways, including protonation, deoxygenation and hydroxylation steps, during CO  2  conversion with H  2  O to C1 products were calculated. The calculation results demonstrate that the Ga  2  O  3  cocatalyst enhances the selective adsorption of CO  2  and slightly weakens the competitive adsorption of H  2  O. The promotion effect of Ga  2  O  3  on the subsequent reaction depends on the availability of protons and electrons. Free energy calculations revealed that the basic functional site generated by Ga  2  O  3  not only suppresses the back reaction of the OH group after H  2  O directly provides protons but also maintains the surface defect oxygen vacancy (V  O  ), which promotes the reaction thermodynamics but tends to be consumed in the process. Additionally, Ga  2  O  3  decoration promotes V  O  formation, and the coexistence of Ga  2  O  3  and V  O  further decreases the reaction rate&#8208;determining step energy barrier, promoting C1 production.</dc:description>

         <title>Metalloimmunotherapy with rhodium and ruthenium complexes: Targeting tumor&#8208;associated macrophages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) suppress the cancer immune response and are a key target for immunotherapy. The effects of ruthenium and rhodium complexes on TAMs have not been well characterized. To address this gap in the field, a panel of 22 dirhodium and ruthenium complexes were screened against three subtypes of macrophages, triple&#8208;negative breast cancer and normal breast tissue cells. Experiments were carried out in 2D and biomimetic 3D co&#8208;culture experiments with and without irradiation with blue light. Leads were identified with cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific toxicity toward macrophage subtypes, cancer cells, or both. Experiments with 3D spheroids revealed complexes that sensitized the tumor models to the chemotherapeutic doxorubicin. Cell surface exposure of calreticulin, a known&#160;facilitator&#160;of immunogenic cell death (ICD), was increased upon treatment, along with a&#160;concomitant&#160;reduction in the M2&#8208;subtype classifier arginase. Our findings lay a strong foundation for the future development of ruthenium&#8208; and rhodium&#8208;based chemotherapies targeting TAMs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>N,N&#8217;  &#8208;disubstituted indigos are photoswitchable molecules that have recently caught the attention due to their addressability by red&#8208;light.&#160;&#160;When alkyl and aryl groups are utilized as the&#160;  N  &#8208;substituents, the thermal half&#8208;lives of&#160;  Z  isomers can be tuned independently while maintaining the advantageous red&#8208;shifted absorption spectra.&#160;&#160;To utilize these molecules in real&#8208;world applications, it is of immense importance to understand how their molecular structures as well as the environment influence their switching properties.&#160;&#160;To this end, we probed their photoisomerization mechanism by carrying out photophysical and computational studies in solvents of different polarities.&#160;&#160;The fluorescence and transient absorption experiments suggest for more polar excited and transition states, which explains the bathochromic shifts of absorption spectra and shorter thermal half&#8208;lives.&#160;&#160;On the other hand, the quantum chemical calculations reveal that in contrast to&#160;  N  &#8208;carbonyl groups,&#160;  N  &#8208;alkyl and&#160;  N  &#8208;aryl substituents are not strongly conjugated with the indigo chromophore and can thus serve as a tool for tuning the thermal stability of&#160;  Z  &#160;isomers.&#160;&#160;Both approaches are combined to provide in&#8208;depth understandings of how indigos undergo photoswitching as well as how they are influenced by&#160;  N  &#8208;substituent and the chemical surroundings.&#160;&#160;These mechanistic insights will serve as guiding principles for designing molecules eyeing broader applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemically Driven Swinging of a Nitrobenzyl Pendant Arm in a Nickel Scorpionand Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A radical anion &#8211;NO  2  &#8226;  &#8722;  is formed upon an electrochemically reversible one&#8208;electron reduction of the square&#8208;planar Ni  II  complex of  N  &#8208;nitrobenzylcyclam. The &#8211;NO  2  &#8226;  &#8722;  group goes to occupy an axial position of the metal ion, thus establishing a significant electronic interaction with the metal center. In particular, the ESR spectrum supports the occurrence of an electron transfer from &#8722;NO  2  &#8226;  &#8722;  to the metal, which therefore presents a significant Ni  I  character. On re&#8208;oxidation, the nitrobenzyl side&#8208;chain detaches and the Ni  II  complex is restored, providing an example of a fully reversible redox driven intramolecular motion.</dc:description>

This was done with the hope that the open &#960;&#8208;faces of the electron&#8208;rich complexes will foster association with planar electron acceptors via &#960;&#8208;stacking. The dinuclear complexes were subjected to cyclic and square wave voltammetry and were characterized in all accessible redox states by IR, UV/Vis/NIR and, where applicable, by EPR spectroscopy.

The more electron&#8208;rich acac  &#8208;  congeners formed non&#8208;conductive 1:1 charge&#8208;transfer (CT) salts on treatment with the F4TCNQ electron acceptor. All spectroscopic techniques confirmed the presence of pairs of complex radical cations and F4TCNQ  &#8226;&#8208;  radical anions in these CT salts, but produced no firm evidence for the relevance of pi&#8208;stacking to their formation and properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Olefin Metathesis Catalysts generated In Situ from Molybdenum(VI)&#8208;Oxo Complexes by Tuning Pendant Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tailored molybdenum(VI)&#8208;oxo complexes of the form MoOCl2(OR)2(OEt)2 catalyse olefin metathesis upon reaction with an organosilicon reducing agent at low temperature, e.g. 70&#176;C, in the presence of olefins. While this reactivity parallels what has recently been observed in the corresponding classical heterogeneous catalysts based on supported metal oxide, the well&#8208;defined nature of our starting systems allows us to understand the influence of structural, spectroscopic and electronic characteristics of the catalytic precursor on the initiation and catalytic proficiency of the final species. The catalytic performance of the pre&#8208;catalysts follows the highly electron withdrawing (&#963;&#8208;donation) character of alkoxide ligands, OtBuF9 being the best. This activity correlates with both the 95Mo chemical shift and the reduction potential that follows the same trend: OtBuF9 &gt; OtBuF6 &gt; OtBuF3.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering of Portable Smartphone Integrated with Liposome&#8208;Encapsulated Curcumin for Onsite Visual Ratiometric Fluorescence Imaging of Hypochlorite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precisely onsite monitoring of hypochlorite (ClO  &#8722;  ) is of great significance to guide its rational use, reducing/avoiding its potential threat toward food safety and human health. Considering ClO  &#8722;  could quench fluorescence of curcumin (CCM) by oxidizing the  o  &#8208;methoxyphenol of CCM into benzoquinone, we designed a portable ratiometric fluorescence sensor integrated with smartphone for realizing the visual point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT) of ClO  &#8722;  . The amphiphilic phospholipid polymer was used as carrier to wrap curcumin, forming a novel liposome&#8208;encapsulated CCM, which provided a scaffold to bind with [Ru(bpy)  3  ]  2+  through electrostatic interaction, thus assembling [Ru(bpy)  3  ]  2+  &#8208;functionalized liposome&#8208;encapsulated CCM ([Ru(bpy)  3  ]  2+  @CCM&#8208;NPs). Further integrated with smartphone, visual imaging of [Ru(bpy)  3  ]  2+  @CCM&#8208;NPs could be achieved and the accurate onsite detection of ClO  &#8722;  could be realized with a detection limit of 66.31 nM and a linear range of 0.2210 to 80.0 &#956;M. In addition, the sensor could monitor ClO  &#8722;  in real samples with an onsite detection time of ~ 154.0 s.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report the synthesis and properties of heterosubtituted &#945;&#946;fused BODIPY fluorophores. The compounds were obtained in good yields by sequential and selective Stille cross&#8208;coupling reactions from 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrahalo&#8208;BODIPY, allowing the introduction of different subtituents at the 3,5 and 2,6 positions of the BODIPY ring. The final fused compounds were synthesized using oxidative cyclisation with ferrous chloride. The fully fused compounds show a strong bathochromically shifted emission along with a hyperchromic shift of the absorption maxima. The fluorescence quantum yields remain relatively large for compounds emitting in this wavelength range. Computational studies have been carried out to fully understand the photophysical behaviour of these dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>Relativistic Spin&#8211;Orbit Electronegativity and the Chemical Bond between a Heavy Atom and a Light Atom</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Relativistic effects are known to alter the chemical bonds and spectroscopic properties of heavy&#8208;element compounds. In this work, we introduce the concept of spin&#8211;orbit (SO) electronegativity of a heavy atom as reflected by an SO&#8208;induced change in the interatomic distance between the heavy atom (HA) and a neighboring light atom (LA). We provide a transparent interpretation of these SO effects by using the concept of spin&#8211;orbit electron deformation density (SO&#8208;EDD). Spin&#8211;orbit coupling at the HA induces rearrangement of the electron density for the scalar&#8208;relativistically optimized geometry that in turn exerts a new force on the LA. The resulting expansion or contraction of the HA&#8211;LA bond depends on the nature and electron configuration of the HA. In addition, we quantify the change in atomic electronegativity induced by SO coupling for a series of hydrides, complementing the SO&#8208;EDD picture. The trends in the SO&#8208;induced electronegativity and the HA&#8211;LA bond distance across the Periodic Table of Elements are demonstrated and interpreted, and also linked, intuitively, with the SO&#8208;induced NMR shielding at the LA.</dc:description>

         <title>Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry Imaging: A New Tool to See through Nanoscale Particles in Biological Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 13, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoscale particles (NPs) are ubiquitous in our daily life, ranging from ambient particulate matter, microplastics to theranostic nanoparticles. Recent research endeavors in laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (LDI&#8208;MSI) have enriched the toolbox for evaluation of NPs&#8217; behaviors in biological tissues. Practical applications of LDI MSI for NPs have been verified in sub&#8208;organ bio&#8208;distribution, drug release evaluation and surface chemical analysis. Here we summarized previous studies in anticipation of more innovations in this field.







Abstract
Understanding the fate of nanoscale particles (NPs) in biological systems is significant with the increasing risk for human exposure. Recent research endeavors in laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (LDI&#8208;MSI) have enriched the toolbox for evaluation of NPs&#8217; behavior in biological tissues, especially in aspects including sub&#8208;organ bio&#8208;distribution, clearance, quantification and surface chemistry variation analysis. In recognition of the potential for advancement in LDI MSI, this concept provides a brief overview of recent research works in LDI MSI for NPs, illustrates new applications that demonstrate the superiority of this technique, and highlights a series of perspectives and directions to move the field forward.

The intermediate incommensurate modulated structure of &#923;&#8208;cobalt (III) sepulchrate trinitrate is ordered yet retains amplitude of molecular rotations common to high temperature disordered as well as low temperature high Z&#8242; structure. Contributions from bifurcated N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O bonds as well as very short H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H contacts in addition to C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O bonds leads to severe frustrations in crystal packing than that in the lock&#8208;in phase.







Abstract
Phase transitions in molecular crystals are often determined by intermolecular interactions. The cage complex of [Co(C12H30N8)]3+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3&#8201;NO3&#8722; is reported to undergo a disorder&#8208;order phase transition at Tc1 &#8776;133&#8197;K upon cooling. Temperature&#8208;dependent neutron and synchrotron diffraction experiments revealed satellite reflections in addition to main reflections in the diffraction patterns below Tc1. The modulation wave vector varies as function of temperature and locks in at Tc3&#8776;98&#8197;K. Here, we demonstrate that the crystal symmetry lowers from hexagonal to monoclinic in the incommensurately modulated phases in Tc1&lt;T&lt;Tc3. Distinctive levels of competitions: trade&#8208;off between longer N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and shorter C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bonds; steric constraints to dense C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O bonds give rise to pronounced modulation of the basic structure. Severely frustrated crystal packing in the incommensurate phase is precursor to optimal balance of intermolecular interactions in the lock&#8208;in phase.

         <title>Activation by Glutathione in Hypoxic Environment of an Azo&#8208;based Rhodamine Activatable Photosensitizer. A Computational Elucidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 13, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mediated reduction: The mechanism of glutathione (GHS)&#8208;mediated reduction of the activatable photosensitizer azoSeRho to the active drug SeRho has been computationally elucidated and requires four GSH molecules to take place. The SeRho formation is favoured in hypoxic environment. The exploration of the SeRho photophysical properties have allowed to highlight its intrinsic properties that make is suitable to trigger type II photoreactions in photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
In the present paper, density functional theory (DFT) has been applied to the study of the activation mechanism of a new selenium azo&#8208;rhodamine (azoSeRho) in presence of the tripeptide thiol, glutathione (GSH), as potent activatable photosensitizer to be employed in photodynamic therapy. The introduction of the azo group into the conjugated system of the seleno&#8208;rhodamine dye and its reaction with GSH allow the selective formation of the active photosensitizer, SeRho. Furthermore, DFT calculations have allowed to shed light on the activation mechanism of the azoSeRho photosensitizer when molecular oxygen is present and hydrogen peroxide is formed. This study is the first theoretical investigation revealing how the reductive cleavage of the azo moiety by GSH occurs. Time&#8208;dependent DFT approach has been used to evaluate the chalcogen&#8208;substitution effect on the structures and photophysical properties of the azo derivatives and, then, on the activated photosensitizers.

         <title>Properties of Bromine Fused Salts Based on Quaternary Ammonium Molecules and Their Relevance for Use in a Hydrogen Bromine Redox Flow Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 13, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Properties of fused salts of quaternary ammonium compounds (QAC) and various polybromides (PB) are investigated for the first time systematically on their applicability in a H2/Br2 flow battery. Fused salt capacities of up to 730&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1 are reached. Conductivity, which bases on a hopping mechanism between PBs, viscosity and temperature stability depend on the chosen QAC and the fractions of PBs present at a selected state of charge of the electrolyte.







Abstract
Bromine complexing agents (BCA) in aqueous electrolytes for hydrogen bromine flow batteries are used to reduce bromine&#8216;s vapour pressure, while an insoluble and liquid fused salt is formed. The properties (concentrations, composition, conductivity and viscosity) of this fused salt are investigated in this study systematically ex situ by using 7 BCAs at different state of charge in HBr/Br2/H2O electrolytes with a theoretical capacity of 179.6&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1. Bromine is stored in the fused salt at concentrations up to 13.6&#8197;M, reaching theoretical volumetrical capacities up to 730&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1 in fused salts. The fused salt consists of a pure, bromine&#8208; and water&#8208;free ionic liquid of organic [BCA]+ cations and polybromides, and its conductivity bases on a hopping mechanism among the polybromides.

     alt="Properties of Bromine Fused Salts Based on Quaternary Ammonium Molecules and Their Relevance for Use in a Hydrogen Bromine Redox Flow Battery"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Properties of fused salts&lt;/b&gt; of quaternary ammonium compounds (QAC) and various polybromides (PB) are investigated for the first time systematically on their applicability in a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; flow battery. Fused salt capacities of up to 730&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; are reached. Conductivity, which bases on a hopping mechanism between PBs, viscosity and temperature stability depend on the chosen QAC and the fractions of PBs present at a selected state of charge of the electrolyte.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bromine complexing agents (BCA) in aqueous electrolytes for hydrogen bromine flow batteries are used to reduce bromine&#8216;s vapour pressure, while an insoluble and liquid fused salt is formed. The properties (concentrations, composition, conductivity and viscosity) of this fused salt are investigated in this study systematically ex situ by using 7 BCAs at different state of charge in HBr/Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O electrolytes with a theoretical capacity of 179.6&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Bromine is stored in the fused salt at concentrations up to 13.6&#8197;M, reaching theoretical volumetrical capacities up to 730&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in fused salts. The fused salt consists of a pure, bromine- and water-free ionic liquid of organic [BCA]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations and polybromides, and its conductivity bases on a hopping mechanism among the polybromides. Alkyl side chain length of the BCAs and distribution of polybromides influence strongly the conductivity and viscosity of the fused salts. 1-ethylpyridin-1-iumbromide results to be favoured BCA for application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quadrupolar Ultrafast Charge Transfer in Diaminoazobenzene&#8208;Bridged Perylenediimide Triads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 13, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient quadrupolar charge transfer in diaminoazobenzene&#8208;bridged perylenediimide triads resulted in wide&#8208;band light capture. Charge&#8208;transfer emission was also possible to observe, and by fluorescence&#8208;spectroelectrochemistry it was possible to revert this phenomenon. Ultrafast quadrupolar charge transfer was confirmed by computational and femtosecond pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy in these triads.







Abstract
Strong push&#8208;pull interactions between electron donor, diaminoazobenzene (azo), and an electron acceptor, perylenediimide (PDI), entities in the newly synthesized A&#8722;D&#8722;A type triads (A=electron acceptor and D=electron donor) and the corresponding A&#8722;D dyads are shown to reveal wide&#8208;band absorption covering the entire visible spectrum. Electrochemical studies revealed the facile reduction of PDI and relatively easier oxidation of diaminoazobenzene in the dyads and triads. Charge transfer reversal using fluorescence&#8208;spectroelectrochemistry wherein the PDI fluorescence recovery upon one&#8208;electron oxidation, deterring the charge&#8208;transfer interactions, was possible to accomplish. The charge transfer state density difference and the frontier orbitals from the DFT calculations established the electron&#8208;deficient PDI to be an electron acceptor and diaminoazobenzene to be an electron donor resulting in energetically closely positioned PDI&#948;&#8722;&#8208;Azo&#948;+&#8208;PDI&#948;&#8722; quadrupolar charge&#8208;transfer states in the case of triads and Azo&#948;+&#8208;PDI&#948;&#8722; dipolar charge&#8208;transfer states in the case of dyads. Subsequent femtosecond transient absorption spectral studies unequivocally proved the occurrence of excited&#8208;state charge transfer in these dyads and triads in benzonitrile wherein the calculated forward charge transfer rate constants, kf, were limited to instrument response factor, meaning &gt;1012&#8197;s&#8722;1 revealing the occurrence of ultrafast photo&#8208;events. The charge recombination rate constant, kr, was found to depend on the type of donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates, that is, it was possible to establish faster kr in the case of triads (&#8764;1011&#8197;s&#8722;1) compared to dyads (&#8764;1010&#8197;s&#8722;1). Modulating both ground and excited&#8208;state properties of PDI with the help of strong quadrupolar and dipolar charge transfer and witnessing ultrafast charge transfer events in the studied triads and dyads is borne out from the present study.

No need for HF: S&#8208;(Trifluoromethyl)benzothioate (TFBT), which is easily synthesized by using KF as the only fluorine source, has been developed as an inexpensive, bench&#8208;stable and user&#8208;friendly trifluoromethylthiolation reagent. TFBT reagent can readily release SCF3&#8722; with various counterions. The synthetic application of TFBT is demonstrated by trifluoromethylthiolation&#8208;halogenation of arynes, bis(trifluoromethylthiolation)&#8208;halogenation of 1,2&#8208;benzdiynes, nucleophilic substitution of alkyl halides, deoxytrifluoromethylthiolation of alcohols, and cross&#8208;coupling with aryl and vinyl boronic acids.

         <title>A New Variant of Emissive RNA Alphabets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 13, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substrate scope of T7 RNA Polymerase and adenosine deaminase (ADA) are expanded by the introduction of a new ribonucleoside alphabet based on a methylthieno[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine core. The majority of the new analogues display significantly red shifted emission relative to the corresponding thieno[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine and isothiazolo[4,3&#8208;d]pyrimidine based analogues.







Abstract
A new fluorescent ribonucleoside alphabet (mthN) consisting of pyrimidine and purine analogues, all derived from methylthieno[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine as the heterocyclic core, is described. Large bathochromic shifts and high microenvironmental susceptibility of their emission relative to previous alphabets derived from thieno[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine (thN) and isothiazole[4,3&#8208;d]pyrimidine (tzN) scaffolds are observed. Subjecting the purine analogues to adenosine deaminase, guanine deaminase and T7 RNA polymerase indicate that, while varying, all but one enzyme tolerate the corresponding mthN/mthNTP substrates. The robust emission quantum yields, high photophysical responsiveness and enzymatic accommodation suggest that the mthN alphabet is a biophysically viable tool and can be used to probe the tolerance of nucleoside/tide&#8208;processing enzymes to structural perturbations of their substrates.

         <title>Exploring the Association of Electron&#8208;Donating Corroles with Phthalocyanines as Electron Acceptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 13, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;covalent corrole&#8208;(Zn)phthalocyanine conjugates were afforded by mixing electron&#8208;donating 10&#8208;meso&#8208;pyridine corroles with an electron&#8208;accepting phthalocyanine. Investigation of the complexation by NMR, absorption, and fluorescence essays revealed binding constants as high as 106&#8201;m&#8722;1. Introducing non&#8208;covalent corrole&#8208;phthalocyanine linkages induces sizeable differences in the context of light harvesting and charge&#8208;transfer when compared to covalently linked equivalents.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;donating corroles (Cor) were integrated with electron&#8208;accepting phthalocyanines (Pc) to afford two different non&#8208;covalent Cor&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Pc systems.

         <title>Directed Synthesis and Chemistry of Unsymmetric Dicationic Diboranes and Their Use in Frustrated Lewis Pair&#8208;like Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 13, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several new unsymmetric dicationic diboranes were synthesized and characterized by substitution reactions of two triflato groups by a phosphino&#8208;pyridine double Lewis base. The intermediate of one of these substitution reactions, in which only the pyridine base of the phosphino&#8208;pyridine is bound to the diboron unit, displays frustrated Lewis pair (FLP)&#8208;like chemistry. On the basis of the results, a new type of FLP chemistry is proposed, using for the first time dicationic diboranes as Lewis acidic component.







Abstract
The chemistry of dicationic diboranes with two BII atoms that are engaged in direct B&#8722;B bonding is by enlarge unexplored, although these molecules have intriguing properties due to their combined Lewis acidic and electron&#8208;donor properties. Unsymmetric dicationic diboranes are extremely rare, but especially attractive due to their polarized B&#8722;B bond. In this work we report the directed synthesis of several stable unsymmetric dicationic diboranes by reaction between the electron&#8208;rich ditriflato&#8208;diborane B2(hpp)2(OTf)2 (hpp=1,3,4,6,7,8&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrimido[1,2&#8208;&#945;]pyrimidinate) and phosphino&#8208;pyridines, establishing B&#8722;N and B&#8722;P bonds with the diborane concomitant with triflate elimination. In the case of 2&#8208;((ditertbutylphosphino)methyl)pyridine, the B&#8722;N bond is formed instantly, but the B&#8722;P bond formation requires (due to steric constraints) several days at ambient conditions for completion, creating an intermediate that could be used for frustrated Lewis pair (FLP)&#8208;like chemistry. Here we test its reaction with an aldehyde, and propose a new type of FLP&#8208;like chemistry.

         <title>Carbodiimide&#8208;Driven Dimerization and Self&#8208;Assembly of Artificial, Ribose&#8208;Based Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 13, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of artificial ribose&#8208;based amphiphiles have been prepared and self&#8208;assembled into various supramolecular structures, exhibiting aggregation&#8208;induced emission. The molecularly dissolved amphiphiles can be converted selectively into dimeric pyrophosphates in the presence of carbodiimide EDC, giving rise to helical fibers with lengths at the micrometer scale.







Abstract
The aqueous self&#8208;assembly of amphiphiles into aggregates such as micelles and vesicles has been widely investigated over the past decades with applications ranging from materials science to drug delivery. The combination of characteristic properties of nucleic acids and amphiphiles is of substantial interest to mimic biological self&#8208;organization and compartmentalization. Herein, we present ribose&#8208; and ribonucleotide&#8208;based amphiphiles and investigate their self&#8208;assembly as well as their fundamental reactivity. We found that various types of aggregates are formed, ranging in size from nanometers to micrometers and all amphiphiles exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) in solution as well as in the solid state. We also observed that the addition of 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;(3&#8208;dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) leads to rapid and selective dimerization of the amphiphiles into pyrophosphates, which decreases the critical aggregation concentration (CAC) by a factor of 25 when compared to the monomers. Since the propensity for amphiphile dimerization is correlated with their tendency to self&#8208;assemble, our results may be relevant for the formation of rudimentary compartments under prebiotic conditions.

         <title>Binding Interactions in Copper, Silver and Gold &#960;&#8208;Complexes</title>

The binding between coinage metal complexes and alkenes or alkynes is affected in a non&#8208;intuitive way by electron withdrawing substituents at the ancillary ligands. Investigation in solution, solid&#8208;state, and gas&#8208;phase gives an insight into the nature of these interactions. Metal&#8208;alkene/alkyne binding energies increase in the order Ag&lt;Cu&lt;Au and they are slightly higher for alkynes than for alkenes. The &#960;&#8208;back bonding interaction is particularly dominant in the gold complexes. Accordingly, the electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents at the ancillary ligands weaken the gold&#8208;alkene/alkyne bonding.







Abstract
The copper(I), silver(I), and gold(I) metals bind &#960;&#8208;ligands by &#963;&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;back bonding interactions. These interactions were investigated using bidentate ancillary ligands with electron donating and withdrawing substituents. The &#960;&#8208;ligands span from ethylene to larger terminal and internal alkenes and alkynes. Results of X&#8208;ray crystallography, NMR, and IR spectroscopy and gas phase experiments show that the binding energies increase in the order Ag&lt;Cu&lt;Au and the binding energies are slightly higher for alkynes than for alkenes. Modulation of the electron density at the metal using substituents on the ancillary ligands shows that the &#960;&#8208;back bonding interaction plays a dominant role for the binding in the copper and gold complexes.

         <title>Remote Oxidative Activation of a [Cp*Rh] Monohydride**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 13, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox chemistry: [Cp*Rh] complexes supported by chelating diphosphine ligands can support generation of isolable metal monohydrides, but prior work has shown that the reduction potentials required to promote cleavage of Rh&#8722;H moieties in these complexes are quite negative. Herein, ligand&#8208;centered oxidation of a [Cp*Rh] monohydride is demonstrated to result in dramatic acidification of a Rh&#8722;H by 23 pKa units. Ligand&#8208;promoted redox chemistry could thus be a useful tool for promoting reactivity in metal&#8211;hydride systems.







Abstract
Half&#8208;sandwich rhodium monohydrides are often proposed as intermediates in catalysis, but little is known regarding the redox&#8208;induced reactivity accessible to these species. Herein, the bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (dppf) ligand has been used to explore the reactivity that can be induced when a [Cp*Rh] monohydride undergoes remote (dppf&#8208;centered) oxidation by 1e&#8722;. Chemical and electrochemical studies show that one&#8208;electron redox chemistry is accessible to Cp*Rh(dppf), including a unique quasi&#8208;reversible RhII/I process at &#8722;0.96&#8197;V vs. ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc+/0). This redox manifold was confirmed by isolation of an uncommon RhII species, [Cp*Rh(dppf)]+, that was characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Protonation of Cp*Rh(dppf) with anilinium triflate yielded an isolable and inert monohydride, [Cp*Rh(dppf)H]+, and this species was found to undergo a quasireversible electrochemical oxidation at +0.41&#8197;V vs. Fc+/0 that corresponds to iron&#8208;centered oxidation in the dppf backbone. Thermochemical analysis predicts that this dppf&#8208;centered oxidation drives a dramatic increase in acidity of the Rh&#8722;H moiety by 23 pKa units, a reactivity pattern confirmed by in situ 1H NMR studies. Taken together, these results show that remote oxidation can effectively induce M&#8722;H activation and suggest that ligand&#8208;centered redox activity could be an attractive feature for the design of new systems relying on hydride intermediates.

Herein, the bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (dppf) ligand has been used to explore the reactivity that can be induced when a [Cp*Rh] monohydride undergoes remote (dppf-centered) oxidation by 1e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Chemical and electrochemical studies show that one-electron redox chemistry is accessible to Cp*Rh(dppf), including a unique quasi-reversible Rh&lt;sup&gt;II/I&lt;/sup&gt; process at &#8722;0.96&#8197;V vs. ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc&lt;sup&gt;+/0&lt;/sup&gt;). This redox manifold was confirmed by isolation of an uncommon Rh&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; species, [Cp*Rh(dppf)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, that was characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Protonation of Cp*Rh(dppf) with anilinium triflate yielded an isolable and inert monohydride, [Cp*Rh(dppf)H]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and this species was found to undergo a quasireversible electrochemical oxidation at +0.41&#8197;V vs. Fc&lt;sup&gt;+/0&lt;/sup&gt; that corresponds to iron-centered oxidation in the dppf backbone. Thermochemical analysis predicts that this dppf-centered oxidation drives a dramatic increase in acidity of the Rh&#8722;H moiety by 23 p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; units, a reactivity pattern confirmed by in situ &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR studies. Taken together, these results show that remote oxidation can effectively induce M&#8722;H activation and suggest that ligand-centered redox activity could be an attractive feature for the design of new systems relying on hydride intermediates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanosized Carbon Macrocycles Based on a Planar Chiral Pseudo Meta&#8208;[2.2]Paracyclophane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 13, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of planar chiral pseudo meta&#8208; [2.2]paracyclophane with cycloparaphenylenes backbone leads to necklace&#8208;shaped chiral macrocycles, which exhibit unique photophysical properties with high fluorescence quantum yield of up to 82&#8201;%. In addition, size&#8208;dependent chiroptical properties with moderately large |glum| and CPL brightness BCPL value originating from the planar chirality of [2.2]paracyclophane were observed.







Abstract
Structural designs combining cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) backbone with planar chiral [2.2]paracyclophane ([2.2]PCP) lead to optical&#8208;active chiral macrocycles with intriguing properties. X&#8208;ray crystal analysis revealed aesthetic necklace&#8208;shaped structures and size&#8208;dependent packages with long&#8208;range channels. The macrocycles exhibit unique photophysical properties with high fluorescence quantum yield of up to 82&#8201;%, and the fluorescent color varies with ring size. In addition, size&#8208;dependent chiroptical properties with moderately large CPL dissymmetry factor of 10&#8722;3 and CPL brightness in the range of 30&#8211;40&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 were observed.

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Methyleneisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones and Isoquinolinium Salts via Exo and Endo Selective Cyclization of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;Alkynyl)benzaldimines</title>

Gold&#8208;catalyzed 5&#8208;exo cyclization/oxidation and silver&#8208;promoted 6&#8208;endo cyclization of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)benzaldimines have been developed to synthesize 3&#8208;methyleneisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones and isoquinolinium salts, respectively. The two kinds of cyclization products could be transformed into isoindolinone&#8208;based benzocyclobutenes, isoquinolinones, 4&#8208;iodo&#8208;isoquinolin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;one, oxazatricycle, and tetrahydroisoquinoline.







Abstract
Coinage metal&#8208;promoted 5&#8208;exo and 6&#8208;endo selective cyclization of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)benzaldimines has been studied. It was found that, under gold catalysis, 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)benzaldimines exclusively underwent 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization processes, followed by oxidation to form N&#8208;aryl 3&#8208;methyleneisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones. In contrast, in the presence of base and under activation of AgOTf, switching of 5&#8208;exo to 6&#8208;endo cyclizations of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)benzaldimines was observed, exclusively giving N&#8208;aryl or N&#8208;alkyl substituted isoquinolinium salts. The two key reaction intermediates, exocyclic vinyl&#8208;Au and the endocyclic vinyl&#8208;Ag species have been isolated and characterized, and a study of their reactivities confirms the plausible mechanisms. Reactions of the resultant 3&#8208;methyleneisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones with benzyne afforded structurally important isoindolinone&#8208;based benzocyclobutenes. Additionally, several interesting transformations of the resultant isoquinolinium salts have been investigated.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights on the Mechanosynthesis of Phenytoin, a WHO Essential Medicine**
</title>

         <dc:description>
In situ monitoring by Raman spectroscopy of the mechanosynthesis of phenytoin, a World Health Organization Essential Medicine, is reported. This study enabled the observation, isolation and characterization of key molecular&#8208;migration intermediates involved in the transformation of benzil (1), urea (2), and KOH into phenytoin (3). The depth of this investigation answers scientifically interesting questions, which might be helpful for the propulsion of mechanosynthetic protocols among mainstream methodologies for synthesis.







Abstract
In recent years, mechanochemistry has enriched the toolbox of synthetic chemists, enabling faster and more sustainable access to new materials and existing products, including active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). However, molecular&#8208;level understanding of most mechanochemical reactions remains limited, delaying the implementation of mechanochemistry in industrial applications. Herein, we have applied in&#8197;situ monitoring by Raman spectroscopy to the mechanosynthesis of phenytoin, a World Health Organization (WHO) Essential Medicine, enabling the observation, isolation, and characterization of key molecular&#8208;migration intermediates involved in the single&#8208;step transformation of benzil, urea, and KOH into phenytoin. This work contributes to the elucidation of a reaction mechanism that has been subjected to a number of interpretations over time and paints a clear picture of how mechanosynthesis can be applied and optimized for the preparation of added&#8208;value molecules.

Isoxazolines without the [3+2]: An electrochemical method for the synthesis of isoxazoline cores is presented. Both aryl and more challenging alkyl aldoximes are converted to the desired isoxazoline through an electrochemically enabled regio&#8208; and diastereoselective reaction with electron&#8208;deficient alkenes. Supporting analyses from kinetic (time&#8208;course) modelling and density functional theory support a stepwise, radical&#8208;mediated mechanism, and discount hypothesised involvement of closed&#8208;shell [3+2] cycloaddition pathways.







Abstract
An electrochemical method for the green and practical synthesis of a broad range of substituted isoxazoline cores is presented. Both aryl and more challenging alkyl aldoximes are converted to the desired isoxazoline in an electrochemically enabled regio&#8208; and diastereoselective reaction with electron&#8208;deficient alkenes. Additionally, in&#8208;situ reaction monitoring methods compatible with electrochemistry equipment have been developed in order to probe the reaction pathway. Supporting analyses from kinetic (time&#8208;course) modelling and density functional theory support a stepwise, radical&#8208;mediated mechanism, and discounts hypothesised involvement of closed shell [3+2] cycloaddition pathways.

Four dibenzofuran&#8208;terminated hole&#8208;transporters exhibit superior thermal and electrical stability, thus realizing highly efficient and long lifetime thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) and phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs). A TADF OLED achieves an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23&#8201;% and operation lifetime (LT50) of over 20&#8201;000&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. Moreover, a phosphorescent OLED achieves an EQE of 21&#8201;% and LT50 of over 30&#8201;000&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
The weak stability of a hole&#8208;transporter upon approaching the anion state is one of the major bottlenecks for developing long&#8208;life organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs). Therefore, in this study, we developed a series of thermally and electrically stable hole&#8208;transporters that are end&#8208;capped with four dibenzofuran units. These materials exhibit i)&#8197;high bond dissociation energy (BDE) toward the anion state, ii)&#8197;a high glass transition temperature (Tg&gt;130&#8201;&#176;C), and iii)&#8197;high triplet energy (ET&gt;2.7&#8197;eV), thereby enabling approximately 20&#8201;% high external quantum efficiency (EQE) and significantly prolonging the stability of both thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) and phosphorescent OLEDs with an operation lifetime at 50&#8201;% (LT50) of 20&#8201;000&#8211;30&#8201;000&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. In addition, investigating their structure&#8208;property relationship revealed that ionization potential (IP), BDE, and Tg are critical prerequisites for the hole&#8208;transporter to prolong lifetime in OLEDs.

         <title>Tuning the (Chir)Optical Properties and Squeezing out the Inherent Chirality in Polyphenylene&#8208;Locked Helical Carbon Nanorings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 13, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the precise synthesis and tuning size&#8208;dependent (chir)optical properties of chiral distorted acenes ([n]CPPAn2,6; n=6&#8211;8). Efficient resolutions for chiral enantiomers with (P)/(M)&#8208;helicity were achieved only when the size is small. These enantiomers showed strong chiroptical properties and dissymmetry factors (|gabs| and |glum|&#8764;0.01 for an enantiomer of [6]CPPAn2,6).







Abstract
Distorting linear polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) out of planarity affects their physical properties and breaks their symmetry to induce inherent chirality. However, the chirality cannot be achieved in large distorted PAHs&#8208;based macrocycles due to a low racemization barrier for isomerization. Herein, we report the precise synthesis and tuning size&#8208;dependent (chir)optical properties of a new class of chiral PAHs&#8208;containing conjugated macrocycles (cyclo[n]paraphenylene&#8208;2,6&#8208;anthrylene, [n]CPPAn2,6; n=6&#8211;8). Their inherent chiralities were squeezed out in small anthrylene&#8208;based macrocycles. Efficient resolutions for chiral enantiomers with (P)/(M)&#8208;helicity of small [6&#8208;7]CPPAns were achieved by HPLC. Interestingly, these macrocycles showed enriched size&#8208;dependent physical, chiral, and (chir)optical properties. Theoretical calculations indicate that these macrocycles have high strain energy (Estrain=60.8 to 73.4&#8197;kcal/mol) and very small Egap (&#8764;3.0&#8197;eV). Notably, these enantiomers showed strong chiroptical properties and dissymmetry factors (|gabs| and |glum|&#8764;0.01 for an enantiomer of [6]CPPAn2,6), which can give them potential applications in optically active materials.

         <title>Cover Feature: Quadrupolar Ultrafast Charge Transfer in Diaminoazobenzene&#8208;Bridged Perylenediimide Triads (Chem. Eur. J. 13/2022)</title>

         <dc:description>
The transfer of charge in covalently linked donor&#8211;acceptor systems is highly important in many areas of chemistry, artificial photosynthesis, semiconductor devices, and solar cells. Intramolecular charge transfer occurs when a fraction of the charge is transferred between the entities after photo&#8208;excitation of the electron donor or acceptor entity. In this study, molecular triads comprising two electron&#8208;deficient perylenediimides are covalently linked to a bridging electron donor, diamino&#8208;azobenzene, to give strong ground&#8208;state polarization resulting in wide&#8208;band optical coverage. Using fluorescence spectro&#8208;electrochemistry, charge&#8208;transfer reversal in these triads is also seen. Further, the formation of ultrafast quadrupolar charge transfer upon photoexcitation is demonstrated. More information can be found in the Research Article by F. Fern&#225;ndez&#8208;L&#225;zaro, F. D&#8242;Souza, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104574).

From inorganic fluoride to organic fluoride: Just as the old Chinese legend that a carp succeed in leaping over the divine gate will become a Chinese dragon. In the presence of 18&#8208;c&#8208;6, KF succeed in reacting with thiophosgene, leaping over obstacles of unstable SCF3 anion intermediate, and is being transformed into trifluoromethylthiolation reagent TFBT, which has been used in trifluoromethylthiolation of a variety of substrates including alkynes, halogenated hydrocarbons, alcohols, boronic acids, etc. More information can be found in the Research Article by J.&#8197;Hu et&#8197;al.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From inorganic fluoride to organic fluoride&lt;/b&gt;: Just as the old Chinese legend that a carp succeed in leaping over the divine gate will become a Chinese dragon. In the presence of 18-&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-6, KF succeed in reacting with thiophosgene, leaping over obstacles of unstable SCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; anion intermediate, and is being transformed into trifluoromethylthiolation reagent TFBT, which has been used in trifluoromethylthiolation of a variety of substrates including alkynes, halogenated hydrocarbons, alcohols, boronic acids, etc. More information can be found in the Research Article by J.&#8197;Hu et&#8197;al.

         <title>Reaching New Biocatalytic Reactivity Using Continuous Flow Reactors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 13, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous flow is a mainstay in the synthetic chemist's toolbox. It has also begun to see increasing application in biocatalysis. This manuscript discusses some of the challenges that continuous flow has contributed solutions to for the improvement of biocatalysis. It also poses how the future of continuous flow biocatalysis will change with new technologies such as automation, in&#8208;line analysis and AI.







Abstract
The use of flow reactors in biocatalysis has increased significantly in recent years. Chemists have begun to design flow systems that even allow new biocatalytic reactions to take place. This concept article will focus on the design of flow systems that have allowed enzymes to go beyond their limits in batch. The case is made for moving towards fully continuous systems. With flow chemistry increasingly seen as an enabling technology for automated synthesis, and with advancements in AI&#8208;assisted enzyme design, there is a real possibility to fully automate the development and implementation of a continuous biocatalytic processes. This will lead to significantly improved enzyme processes for synthesis.

         <title>Strong Antibiotic Activity of the Myxocoumarin Scaffold in vitro and in vivo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The increasing emergence of resistances against established antibiotics is a substantial threat to human health. The discovery of new compounds with potent antibiotic activity is thus of utmost importance. Within this work, we identify strong antibiotic activity of the natural product myxocoumarin B from Stigmatella aurantiaca MYX&#8208;030 against a range of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens, including clinical isolates of MRSA. A focused library of structural analogs was synthesized to explore initial structure&#8208;activity relationships and to identify equipotent myxocoumarin derivatives devoid of the natural nitro substituent to significantly streamline synthetic access. The cytotoxicity of the myxocoumarins as well as their potential to cure bacterial infections in vivo was established using a zebrafish model system. Our results reveal the exceptional antibiotic activity of the myxocoumarin scaffold and hence its potential for the development of novel antibiotics.</dc:description>

         <title>Decoration Strategy in Para Boron Position: An Effective Way to Achieve Ideal Multi&#8208;Resonance Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Narrowband, full&#8208;color, and quenching&#8208;resistant emitters are urgently needed for the next generation high&#8208;resolution displays. Though the flourishment of narrowband multiple resonance (MR) emitters in blue region, these materials still face thorny challenges such as effective light&#8208;color regulation strategies and concentration&#8208;induced spectral broadening/emission quenching. Herein, we highlight the research status of an effective "decoration strategy for para B position". On one hand, the introduction of an electron donor or acceptor could induce a hypochromatic&#8208; or bathochromic&#8208;shift emission respectively without undesirable FWHM broadening. On the other hand, a more advanced molecular motif is further proposed through adopting a peripheral benzene ring on the para position of the B&#8208;substituted phenyl in MR core to construct the high&#8208;purity, high&#8208;efficiency, quenching&#8208;resistant and stable MR emitters. Such concept is expected to provide a possible way for the modification, optimization and expansion of MR emitters to meet more possible applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Oxidation of Veratryl Alcohol Derivatives Using RuCo/rGO Composites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidizing chemoselectively the C&#945;&#8208;OH to C=O has been considered as a key step for oxidative depolymerization of the lignin. In this work, we design and prepare a series of composites of RuCo alloy nanoparticles and reduced graphene oxide (RuCo/rGO) with different Ru to Co ratios, and explore their catalytic activities in the oxidation of veratryl alcohol derivatives, which serve usually as the model compounds for studying the lignin oxidation. It is illustrated that the Ru to Co ratio determines the morphology and average size of the RuCo alloy nanoparticles on rGO, and the overall catalytic activities of the composites. The RuCo alloy nanoparticles on rGO with Ru to Co ratios of 1:0 to 1.2:1 show unique flower&#8208;shaped morphology that increases the exposure of the active sites and thus promotes their contact with the substrates. The RuCo/rGO composites exhibit high catalytic activities for the oxidation of C&#945;&#8208;OH to aldehydes&#160;&#160;at 100 &#176;C for 2 h. Besides, Co component affords the RuCo/rGO composites with magnetic properties that make the separation and recovery of the catalyst simple. Given the high catalytic performances and easy recovery, the RuCo/rGO composites would be potentially useful for the depolymerization of lignin.</dc:description>

         <title>DoE&#8208;driven development of an organocatalytic enantioselective addition of acetaldehyde&#160;to nitrostyrenes in water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of an enantioselective enamine&#8208;catalysed addition of masked acetaldehyde to nitroalkenes via a rational approach helped to move away from the use of chloroform.

         <title>Nanohybridization of CoS2/MoS2 heterostructure  with polyoxometalate on functionalized reduced graphene oxide for high&#8208;performance LIBs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To address the poor cycling stability and low rate capability of MoS  2  as electrode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), herein, the CoS  2  /MoS  2  /PDDA&#8208;rGO/PMo  12  nanocomposites are constructed via a simple hydrothermal process, combining the advantages of all three, namely, CoS  2  /MoS  2  heterojunction and polyoxometalates (POMs) provide abundant catalytically active sites and increase the multi&#8208;electron transfer ability, and the positively charged poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) modified reduced graphene oxide (PDDA&#8208;rGO) improve electronic conductivity and effectively prevent the aggregation of MoS  2  , meanwhile stabilize the negatively charged [PMo  12  O  40  ]  3&#8208;  . After the electrochemical testing, the resulting CoS  2  /MoS  2  /PDDA&#8208;rGO/PMo  12  nanocomposite achieved 1055 mA h g  &#8208;1  initial specific capacities and stabilized at 740 mA h g  &#8208;1  after 150 cycles at 100 mA g  &#8208;1  current density. And the specific capacities of MoS  2  , MoS  2  /PDDA&#8208;rGO, CoS  2  /MoS  2  , and CoS  2  /MoS  2  /PDDA&#8208;rGO were 201, 421, 518, and 589 at 100 mA g  &#8208;1  after 150 cycles, respectively. The fact of the greatly improving capacity of MoS  2  &#8208;based nanocomposites suggests its potential for high performance electrode materials of LIBs. Moreover, the lithium storage mechanism of CoS  2  /MoS  2  /PDDA&#8208;rGO/PMo  12  has been discussed by cyclic voltammetry with different scan rates.</dc:description>

         <title>Marriage of Heterobuckybowls with Triptycene: Molecular Waterwheels for Separating C60 and C70</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploration of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycycles, particularly those have &#960;&#8208;frameworks spread over the three&#8208;dimensional space, is essential in materials science and synthetic chemistry as these chemical entities possess featured optoelectronic properties and supramolecular assembly. Herein, the bowlshaped trichalcogenasumanenes are fused onto three branches of triptycene through pyrazine units, affording waterwheel&#8208;like three&#8208;dimensional polycycles 4a/4b  . Because the three branches on 4a/4b  are chemically equal, the molecular orbitals of 4a/4b  show degenerate feature that results in the strong UV&#8208;Vis absorbance at steady state. The 4a/4b  exhibit photo&#8208;induced charge&#8208;separation and subsequent charge&#8208;redistribution at transient state, leading to excited state absorption in NIR&#8208;II window (1165&#8211;1400 nm). The 4a/4b  are excellent fullerene receptors, and they form the 1 : 1 host&#8208;guest complexes with C 60  /C 70  as proved by spectroscopic titrations and single crystal structure analysis. Moreover, the 4a/4b  show much stronger affinity toward C 70  than C 60  . Consequently, the 4a/4b  are able to separate C 60  and C 70  from their mixture, giving the purity of C 60  up to 99.5%.</dc:description>

         <title>Helical Chiral N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ligands in Enantioselective Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical&#8208;NHC ligands were for the first time used as chiral ligands in enantioselective gold(I) catalysis. The introduction of the chirality was realized in a key post&#8208;functionalization step and led to the generation of a chiral NHC laterally substituted by a new configurationally stable [5]&#8208;helicoidal moiety. This structural design allowed good activities and high ee values in the gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of N&#8208;tethered enynes.







Abstract
The first chiral helicene&#8208;NHC gold(I) complexes efficient in enantioselective catalysis were prepared. The L&#8208;shaped chiral ligand is composed of an imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene (IPy) scaffold laterally substituted by a configurationally stable [5]&#8208;helicenoid unit. The chiral information was introduced in a key post&#8208;functionalization step of a NHC&#8208;gold(I) complex bearing a symmetrical anionic fluoreno[5]helicene substituent, leading to a racemic mixture of complexes featuring three correlated elements of chirality, namely central, axial and helical chirality. After HPLC enantiomeric resolution, X&#8208;ray crystallography and theoretical calculations enabled structural and stereochemical characterization of these configurationally stable NHC&#8208;gold(I) complexes. The high potential in asymmetric catalysis is demonstrated in the benchmark cycloisomerization of N&#8208;tethered 1,6&#8208;enynes with up to 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 er.

         <title>Transition Metal Catalyst Free Synthesis of Olefins from Organoboron Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many boron based olefinations proceed via intermediates with leaving groups &#946;&#8208;positon. These can undergo stereospecific syn&#8208; or anti&#8208;elimination and are useful for the synthesis of complex olefins. Three main strategies emerged differing in the preparation of the pivotal intermediate: (i) Diastereospecific methods like the addition of a boron&#8208;stabilized anion (d1) to an aldehyde or ketone (a1), (ii) Diastereospecific 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangements of boron&#8208;ate&#8208;complexes with appropriate heterocycles and (iii) addition of chiral carbenoids (d1) to boronates with a suitable group in &#945;&#8208;position (a1).







Abstract
Stereoselective preparation of highly substituted olefins is still a severe challenge that requires well defined elimination precursors.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Many boron based olefinations&lt;/b&gt; proceed via intermediates with leaving groups &#946;-positon. These can undergo stereospecific &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;- or &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-elimination and are useful for the synthesis of complex olefins. Three main strategies emerged differing in the preparation of the pivotal intermediate: (i) Diastereospecific methods like the addition of a boron-stabilized anion (d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) to an aldehyde or ketone (a&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;), (ii) Diastereospecific 1,2-metalate rearrangements of boron-ate-complexes with appropriate heterocycles and (iii) addition of chiral carbenoids (d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) to boronates with a suitable group in &#945;-position (a&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

&#8220;N&#8208;hancing&#8221; the electron&#8208;acceptor strength by isosteric [CH&#8594;N] replacement in the peropyrene polycyclic aromatic core. The synthesis of an octaazaperopyrene (OAPP) dye is described along with its electrochemical and photophysical properties and placed in the general context of N&#8208;heteroatom derivatives of such polycyclic functional dyes. Their strong electron&#8208;acceptor properties render OAPPs borderline cases of molecular stability under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Ortho substituted octaazaperopyrenes (OAPPs) are a new class of functional dyes characterized by their strong electron&#8208;accepting behavior. Herein, the synthesis, as well as the electrochemical and photo physical properties of an OAPP dye, is reported. The OAPP target was prepared via selective nucleophilic substitution at the peri position of a bay chlorinated tetraazaperylene by introduction of four amino&#8208;substituents. The resulting tetraminoperylene was reacted with different acyl chlorides and anhydrides to give the twisted bay chlorinated OAPP derivatives which were isolated in their reduced dihydro&#8208;form. The OAPP target could be obtained via a palladium catalyzed dehalogenation and a subsequent oxidation. The eightfold isosteric [CH&#8594;N] replacement within the peropyrene core structure results in a large decrease of the frontier orbital energies, rendering the target compound a potent oxidant while preserving the planarity of the aromatic core. The radical anion was obtained by reduction of the OAPP with KC8 and characterized by EPR spectroscopy. A general discussion of the number and location of [CH&#8594;N] replacements in peropyrene structures and their frontier orbital energies is provided.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Promoted Radical Ring&#8208;Opening/Pyridylation of Cyclobutanols with N&#8208;Methoxypyridinium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient silver&#8208;catalyzed radical ring&#8208;opening/pyridylation of tertiary cyclobutanol with N&#8208;methoxypyridinium salts has been achieved for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;ketopyridines. The overall process is thought to occur by &#946;&#8208;scission of the corresponding cyclobutoxy radical to generate an alkyl radical, that adds to the pyridinium salt. A wide range of tertiary cyclobutanols and N&#8208;methoxypyridinium salts are compatible with these reaction conditions.







Abstract
The silver&#8208;promoted reaction of tertiary cyclobutanols with N&#8208;methoxypyridinium salts enables the efficient synthesis of a range of C2&#8208;substituted pyridines. The overall process likely occurs by ring&#8208;opening (via &#946;&#8208;scission) of the cyclobutoxy radical to generate the corresponding &#947;&#8208;keto alkyl radical that itself adds to the pyridinium salt. A wide range of tertiary cyclobutanols and N&#8208;methoxypyridinium salts are compatible with the reaction conditions.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective Conjugate Addition Reaction of Aldehydes to C&#8208;Substituted Maleimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Challenging transformation A peptide catalyst facilitated access to succinimides and downstream heterocycles with three contiguous stereogenic centers via stereo&#8208;, chemo&#8208; and regioselective conjugate addition reaction between aldehydes and C&#8208;substituted maleimides.







Abstract
Catalytic stereoselective additions with maleimides are useful one&#8208;step reactions to yield chiral succinimides, molecules that are widespread among therapeutically active compounds but challenging to prepare when the maleimide is C&#8208;substituted. We present the tripeptide H&#8208;Pro&#8208;Pro&#8208;Asp&#8208;NHC12H25 as a catalyst for conjugate addition reactions between aldehydes and C&#8208;substituted maleimides to form succinimides with three contiguous stereogenic centers in high yields and stereoselectivities. The peptidic catalyst is so chemoselective that no protecting group is needed at the imide nitrogen of the maleimides. Derivatization of the succinimides was straightforward and provided access to chiral pyrrolidines, lactones, and lactams. Kinetic studies, including a Hammett plot, provided detailed insight into the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework (MOF) Morphology Control by Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A methodology for the controlled production of MOF morphologies through additive design is applied to synthesize new morphologies for a series of crystallographically cubic Zn4O&#8208;based MOFs. This approach broadly provides a model for the design and synthesis of morphologies with desired crystal facets that can be accessed based on an understanding and use of connections between additives and metal cluster across a pore window.







Abstract
Exerting morphological control over metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is critical for determining their catalytic performance and to optimize their packing behavior in areas from separations to fuel gas storage. A mechanism&#8208;based approach to tailor the morphology of MOFs is introduced and experimentally demonstrated for five cubic Zn4O&#8208;based MOFs. This methodology provides three key features: 1) computational screening for selection of appropriate additives to change crystal morphology based on knowledge of the crystal structure alone; 2) use of additive to metal cluster geometric relationships to achieve morphologies expressing desired crystallographic facets; 3) potential for suppression of interpenetration for certain phases.

         <dc:description>Xanthene derivatives have broad applications in medicines, fluorescent probes, dyes, food additives, etc. Therefore, much attention was focused on developing the synthetic methods to prepare these compounds. Binaphthyl&#8208;based xanthene derivatives were prepared through the oxidation of BINOLs promoted by the hypervalent iodine reagent iodosylbenzene (PhIO). Nine&#8208;membered lactones were obtained through a similar oxidative reaction when iodylbenzene (PhIO  2  ) was used. Additionally, one&#8208;pot reactions of BINOLs, PhIO and nucleophiles such as alcohols and amines were also investigated to provide alkoxylated products and amides in good to excellent yields.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Phosphaketenes are versatile reagents in organophosphorus chemistry. We herein report on the synthesis of novel bis&#8208;phosphaketenes, LM(PCO)  2  (M = Ga  2a  , In  2b  , L = HC[C(Me)N(Ar)]  2  ; Ar = 2,6&#8208;  i&#8208;  Pr  2  C  6  H  3  ) by salt metathesis reactions and their reactions with LGa to metallaphosphenes LGa(OCP)PML (M = Ga  3a  , In  3b  ).  3b  represents the first compound with significant In&#8211;P &#960;&#8208;bonding contribution as was confirmed by DFT calculations. Compounds  3a  and  3b  selectively activate the N&#8210;H and O&#8210;H bonds of aniline and phenol at the Ga&#8210;P bond and both reactions proceed with a rearrangement of the phosphaethynolate group from Ga&#8210;OCP to M&#8210;PCO bonding. Compounds  2  &#8211;  5  are fully characterized by heteronuclear (  1  H,  13  C{  1  H},  31  P{  1  H}) NMR and IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (sc&#8208;XRD).</dc:description>

         <title>Diradicals photogeneration from chloroaryl substituted carboxylic acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the aim of generating new, thermally inaccessible diradicals, potentially able to induce a double&#8208;strand DNA cleavage, the photochemistry of a set of chloroaryl substituted carboxylic acids in polar media was investigated. The photoheterolytic cleavage of the Ar&#8722;Cl bond occurred in each case to form the corresponding triplet phenyl cations. Under basic conditions, the photorelease of the chloride anion was accompanied by an intramolecular electron&#8208;transfer from the carboxylate group to the aromatic radical cationic site to give a diradical species. This latter intermediate could then undergo CO2 loss in a structure&#8208;dependent fashion, according to the stability of the resulting diradical, or abstract hydrogen atom from the medium. In aqueous environment at physiological pH (pH = 7.3), both a phenyl cation and a diradical chemistry was observed. The mechanistic scenario and the role of the various intermediates (aryl cations and diradicals) involved in the process was supported by computational analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical fibrous honeycomb ceramics with high load capability and low light&#8208;off temperature for the next&#8208;generation auto emissions standards</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel and stringent automotive exhaust gas emissions standards are urgently needed to counter the problems posed by the worsening global climate and environment. However, the traditional cordierite&#8208;based honeycomb ceramics substrates with ultimate pore density have seriously restricted the establishment of new emission standards. Herein, we introduce a novel robust substrate with tailored volume&#8208;specific surface area and low heat capacity. This substrate employs the synergy of high&#8208;strength ceramic fibers and ultrathin TiO  2  nanosheets. The micro&#8208;sized fibers provide support to ensure structural strength during the catalytic reaction, while the nanosheets play the dual role of connecting the fibers and providing a high surface area for catalyst immobilization. The new three&#8208;dimensional (3D) microarchitecture exhibits a high volume&#8208;specific surface area of 3.59 &#215; 10  4  cm  2  /cm  3  , a compressive strength of 2.01 MPa, and remarkable stability after high&#8208;speed air erosion at 800&#176;C. The honeycomb&#8208;like structure exhibit low resistance to gas flow. Furthermore, after loading with Pt and Pd nanoparticles, the composite 3D microarchitecture delivered an excellent catalytic performance and prominent structural stability, with a super low light&#8208;off temperature of 150&#176;C. The outstanding mechanical and thermal stability and the high surface area and light&#8208;off temperature of the new substrate indicate its potential for use as a highly efficient catalytic carrier to meet the next&#8208;generation auto emissions standards.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonfullerene acceptor based organic solar cells (NF&#8208;OSCs) have witnessed rapid progress over the past few years owing to the intensive research efforts on novel electron donor and nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) materials, interfacial engineering, and device processing techniques. Interfacial layers including electron transporting layers (ETL) and hole transporting layers (HTLs) are crucially important in the OSCs for facilitating electron and hole extractions from the photoactive blend to the respective electrodes. In this review, the progress in both ETLs and HTLs for the currently prevailing NF&#8208;OSCs are discussed, in which the ETLs are summarized from the categories of metal oxides, metal chelates, non&#8208;conjugated electrolytes and conjugated electrolytes, and the HTLs are summarized from the categories of inorganic and organic materials. Some facile methods to develop efficient ETL/HTL materials for high&#8208;performance NF&#8208;OSCs are also highlighted. Finally, the futural prospects of ETL/HTL materials for NF&#8208;OSCs are provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative assessment of ligand substituent effects on &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;contributions to Fe&#8208;N bonds in spin crossover FeII complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The effect of para&#8208;substituent X on the electronic structure of 16 tridentate 4&#8208;X&#8208;(2,6&#8208;di(pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl))&#8208;pyridine (bppX) ligands and the corresponding solution spin crossover [FeII(bppX)2]2+ complexes is analysed further, to supply quantitative insights into the effect of X on the &#963;&#8208;donor and &#960;&#8208;acceptor character of the Fe&#8208;NA(pyridine) bonds. EDA&#8208;NOCV on the 16 LS complexes revealed that neither &#916;Eorb,&#963;+&#960; (R2=0.48) nor &#916;Eorb,&#960; (R2=0.31) correlated with the experimental solution T1/2 values (which are expected to reflect the ligand field imposed on the iron centre), but that &#916;Eorb,&#963; correlates well (R2=0.82) and implies that as X changes from EDG&#224;EWG (Electron Donating to Withdrawing Group), the ligand becomes a better &#963;&#8208;donor. This counter&#8208;intuitive result was further probed by Mulliken analysis of the NA atomic orbitals: NA(px) involved in the Fe&#8208;N &#963;&#8208;bond vs. the perpendicular NA(pz) employed in the ligand aromatic &#960;&#8208;system. &#160;As X changes EDG&#224;EWG, the electron population on NA(pz) decreases, making it a better &#960;&#8208;acceptor, whilst that in NA(px) increases, making it a better &#963;&#8208;bond donor; both increase ligand field, and T1/2 as observed. In 2016, Halcrow, Deeth and co&#8208;workers proposed an intuitively reasonable explanation of the effect of the para&#8208;X substituents on the T1/2 values in this family of complexes, consistent with the calculated MO energy levels, that M&#224;L &#960;&#8208;backdonation dominates in these M&#8208;L bonds. Here the quantitative EDA&#8208;NOCV analysis of the M&#8208;L bond contributions provides a more complete, coherent and detailed picture of the relative impact of M&#8208;L &#963;&#8208; versus &#960;&#8208;bonding in determining the observed T1/2, refining the earlier interpretation and revealing the importance of the &#963;&#8208;bonding. Furthermore, our results are in perfect agreement with the &#916;E(HS&#8208;LS) vs &#963;p+(X) correlation reported in their work</dc:description>

         <title>Thiourea&#8208; and Amino&#8208;substituted Benzoxadiazole Dyes with Large Stokes Shifts as Red&#8208;emitting Probe Monomers for Imprinted Polymer Layers Targeting Carboxylate&#8208;containing Antibiotics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bifunctional fluorescent molecular oxoanion probes based on the benzoxadiazole (BD) chromophore are described which integrate a thiourea binding motif and a polymerizable 2&#8208;aminoethyl methacrylate unit in the 4,7&#8208;positions of the BD core. Concerted charge transfer in this electron donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor architecture endows the dyes with strongly Stokes shifted (up to &gt;250 nm) absorption and fluorescence. Binding of electron&#8208;rich carboxylate guests at the thiourea receptor leads to further analyte&#8208;induced red&#8208;shifts of the emission, shifting the fluorescence maximum of the complexes to &#8805;700 nm. Association constants for acetate are ranging from 1&#8211;5 &#215; 10  5  M  &#8211;1  in acetonitrile. Integration of one of the fluorescent probes via its polymerizable moiety into molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) grafted from the surface of submicron silica cores yielded fluorescent MIP&#8208;coated particle probes for the selective detection of antibiotics containing aliphatic carboxylate groups such as enoxacin (ENOX) at micromolar concentrations in highly polar solvents like acetonitrile.</dc:description>

         <title>H/F Substitution Induced Large Increase of Tc in a 3D Hybrid Rare&#8208;Earth Double Perovskite Multifunctional Compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two A2BIBIII(NO3)6&#8208;type hybrid rare&#8208;earth double perovskites, (HQ)2RbEu(NO3)6 (HQ=quinuclidium) and (4FHQ)2RbEu(NO3)6 (4FHQ=4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;quinuclidium), exhibit excellent high&#8208;temperature ferroelasticity, dielectric switch, and high&#8208;efficiency photoluminescence response. The properties of the latter have been changed compared with the former through H/F substitution. The results reveal that H/F substitution provides an effective method for achieving novel properties, and more hybrid perovskites can be prepared. More information can be found in the Research Article by L.&#8208;P.&#8197;Miao, C.&#8197;Shi, Y.&#8197;Zhang et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103913).

         <title>Investigating a Boronate&#8208;Affinity&#8208;Guided Acylation Reaction for Labelling Native Antibodies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A boronic acid based biorthogonal probe in combination with an acyl donor has been introduced that enables site&#8208;specific incorporation of azide group at the Ser and Tyr residues of nonengineered full&#8208;length antibody. Further derivatization of this functional site was accomplished through click reaction, yielding well&#8208;defined immunoconjugates. The generality of this boronate&#8208;affinity method has been demonstrated on a number of monoclonal antibodies, all with different binding specificities. More information can be found in the Research Article by W.&#8208;S. Wayne&#8197;Chang, C.&#8208;C. Lin et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104178).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While concerns about improving recharged afterglow intensity  in vivo  still motivate further exploration, afterglow nanoparticles (AGNP) offer unique optical merit for autofluorescence&#8208;free biological imaging. Apart from efforts enhancing the afterglow emission properties of AGNP, improving afterglow excitation response to visible or near infrared light is important but has lacked success. Dye sensitization has been used to improve the optical response of photovoltaic nanomaterials and to enhance upconversion luminescence efficiency. This concept has recently been expanded and applied to AGNPs. As a new multifunctional nanoprobe, such dye&#8208;sensitized AGNP takes advantage of both high spatial resolution fluorescence imaging and sensitive afterglow imaging. This perspective introduces the background, the concept, mechanism, and related imaging application, as well as existing challenges and proposes future developmental directions for the dye&#8208;sensitized AGNPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Dissolution Behavior and Varied Mesoporosity of Zeolites by NH4F Etching</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the particularities of zeolites dissolution topology, hidden mosaic structures and zeolite microporosity are identified as interlocking factors in shaping the final dissolution behavior of zeolites and the resultant mesoporosity pattern. The size, shape, concentration, and spatial distribution of the mosaic structures predefine the size and morphology of the void space left by dissolution. The dimensions and topology of the micropores determine the dissolution preference towards single framework atoms, interior mosaic blocks, or exterior features of zeolite crystals.







Abstract
The mesopores formation in zeolite crystals has long been considered to occur through the stochastic hydrolysis and removal of framework atoms. Here, we investigate the NH4F etching of representative small, medium, and large pore zeolites and show that the zeolite dissolution behavior, therefore the mesopore formation probability, is dominated by zeolite architecture at both nano&#8208; and sub&#8208;nano scales. At the nano&#8208;scale, the hidden mosaics of zeolite structure predetermine the spatio&#8208;temporal dissolution of the framework, hence the size, shape, location, and orientation of the mesopores. At the sub&#8208;nano scale, the intrinsic micropore size and connectivity jointly determine the diffusivity of reactant and dissolved products. As a result, the dissolution propensity varies from removing small framework fragments to consuming nanodomains and up to full digestion of the outmost part of zeolite crystals. The new knowledge will lead to new understanding of zeolite dissolution behavior and new adapted strategies for tailoring hierarchical zeolites.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Evaluation of Novel Carbazole&#8208;Derived Photocages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gone in a flash: Two novel photocages, NCARB, and its more water&#8208;soluble analog, NCARB&#8208;DA, have been developed. Both exhibit photophysical properties superior to other o&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;derived photocages and may be used to cage carboxylic acid and phenolic functional groups as exemplified by the use of NCARB&#8208;DA to cage a fluoroquinolone antibiotic and a protected tyrosine residue.







Abstract
We report the design, synthesis and evaluation of two novel photocages, NCARB and isoNCARB, belonging to the o&#8208;nitrobenzyl chemotype and based on the carbazole ring system. The synthesis of each of these isomeric caging molecules was achieved in five steps and in 29&#8201;% overall yield, and their photochemical properties were evaluated using benzoic acid as a model for caging. In the event, upon irradiation at 400&#8197;nm for 60&#8197;min, 82&#8201;% and 42&#8201;% of benzoic acid was freed from the NCARB and isoNCARB photocages, respectively, whereas only 22&#8201;% was released from the nitrodibenzofuran (NDBF) cage. Moreover, the photochemical decaging efficiencies, &#1013;&#934;, of the benzoates photocaged with NCARB and isoNCARB are about 150&#8208; and 20&#8208;fold better, respectively, at 400&#8197;nm than the corresponding caged benzoate derived from NDBF. The water solubility of molecules caged with nitrocarbazole analogs was improved by N&#8208;alkylation of NCARB, the better of the two new photocages, with an aminodicarboxylate group. This modified cage, NCARB&#8208;DA, was exploited in the design of a caged fluoroquinolone antibiotic, the efficacy of which was illustrated in a bacterial growth inhibition assay, and a phenol&#8208;caged tyrosine derivative.

         <title>A Universal DNA Aptamer that Recognizes Spike Proteins of Diverse SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Variants of Concern</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique DNA aptamer, denoted MSA52, displays universally high affinity for the spike proteins of the wild&#8208;type SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 as well as its Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon, Kappa, Delta and Omicron variants. This aptamer also recognizes pseudotyped lentiviruses expressing eight different spike proteins of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 with very high affinity, exhibiting dissociation constants (Kd) of 20&#8211;50&#8197;pM for these viruses.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Ring Expansion Reactions of Calix[3]pyrrole&#8208;Related Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Growing rings: Calix[n]furan[3&#8208;n]pyrroles (n=0&#8764;3) were synthesized from cyclicoligoketone precursors to investigate strain&#8208;induced macrocyclic ring expansion reactions. As the number of inner NH sites increases, the macrocyclic ring strain increased. Detailed mechanism analysis revealed that calix[6]pyrrole type larger macrocycles were formed through regioselective cleavage and subsequent cyclodimerization of linear intermediates.







Abstract
The recent discovery of calix[3]pyrrole, a porphyrinogen&#8208;like tripyrrolic macrocycle, has provided an unprecedented strain&#8208;induced ring expansion reaction into calix[6]pyrrole. Here, we synthesized calix[n]furan[3&#8208;n]pyrrole (n=1&#8764;3) macrocycles to investigate the reaction scope and mechanism of the ring expansion. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis and theoretical calculations revealed that macrocyclic ring strain increases as the number of inner NH sites increases. While calix[1]furan[2]pyrrole exhibited almost quantitative conversion into calix[2]furan[4]pyrrole within 5&#8197;minutes, less&#8208;strained calix[2]furan[1]pyrrole and calix[3]furan were inert. However, N&#8208;methylation of calix[2]furan[1]pyrrole induced a ring&#8208;expansion reaction that enabled the isolation of a linear reaction intermediate. The mechanism analysis revealed that the ring expansion consists of regioselective ring cleavage and subsequent cyclodimerization. This reaction was further utilized for synthesis of calix[6]&#8208;type macrocycles.

A quantum chemical study of model complexes finds that reaction energies for the generation of a coordination vacancy at the Fe center of naphthalene dioxygenase through water reorientation and dioxygen binding are insensitive to the presence of naphthalene. The role of the substrate only becomes evident after Rieske cluster oxidation for the 6&#8208;coordinate Fe active site where an additional electron is likely to be first transfered to the naphthalene substrate. These results imply allosteric control of the substrate on Rieske dioxygenase reactivity.







Abstract
Rieske dioxygenases belong to the non&#8208;heme iron family of oxygenases and catalyze important cis&#8208;dihydroxylation as well as O&#8208;/N&#8208;dealkylation and oxidative cyclization reactions for a wide range of substrates. The lack of substrate coordination at the non&#8208;heme ferrous iron center, however, makes it particularly challenging to delineate the role of the substrate for productive 
 activation. Here, we studied the role of the substrate in the key elementary reaction leading to 
 activation from a theoretical perspective by systematically considering (i) the 6&#8208;coordinate to 5&#8208;coordinate conversion of the non&#8208;heme FeII upon abstraction of a water ligand, (ii) binding of 
, and (iii) transfer of an electron from the Rieske cluster. We systematically evaluated the spin&#8208;state&#8208;dependent reaction energies and structural effects at the active site for all combinations of the three elementary processes in the presence and absence of substrate using naphthalene dioxygenase as a prototypical Rieske dioxygenase. We find that reaction energies for the generation of a coordination vacancy at the non&#8208;heme Fe
 center through thermoneutral H2O reorientation and exothermic 
 binding prior to Rieske cluster oxidation are largely insensitive to the presence of naphthalene and do not lead to formation of any of the known reactive Fe&#8208;oxygen species. By contrast, the role of the substrate becomes evident after Rieske cluster oxidation and exclusively for the 6&#8208;coordinate non&#8208;heme Fe
 sites in that the additional electron is found at the substrate instead of at the iron and oxygen atoms. Our results imply an allosteric control of the substrate on Rieske dioxygenase reactivity to happen prior to changes at the non&#8208;heme Fe
 in agreement with a strategy that avoids unproductive 
 activation.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A quantum chemical&lt;/b&gt; study of model complexes finds that reaction energies for the generation of a coordination vacancy at the Fe center of naphthalene dioxygenase through water reorientation and dioxygen binding are insensitive to the presence of naphthalene. The role of the substrate only becomes evident after Rieske cluster oxidation for the 6-coordinate Fe active site where an additional electron is likely to be first transfered to the naphthalene substrate. These results imply allosteric control of the substrate on Rieske dioxygenase reactivity.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rieske dioxygenases belong to the non-heme iron family of oxygenases and catalyze important &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-dihydroxylation as well as &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-/&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-dealkylation and oxidative cyclization reactions for a wide range of substrates. The lack of substrate coordination at the non-heme ferrous iron center, however, makes it particularly challenging to delineate the role of the substrate for productive 
 activation. Here, we studied the role of the substrate in the key elementary reaction leading to 
 activation from a theoretical perspective by systematically considering (i) the 6-coordinate to 5-coordinate conversion of the non-heme Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; upon abstraction of a water ligand, (ii) binding of 
, and (iii) transfer of an electron from the Rieske cluster. We systematically evaluated the spin-state-dependent reaction energies and structural effects at the active site for all combinations of the three elementary processes in the presence and absence of substrate using naphthalene dioxygenase as a prototypical Rieske dioxygenase. We find that reaction energies for the generation of a coordination vacancy at the non-heme Fe
 center through thermoneutral H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O reorientation and exothermic 
 binding prior to Rieske cluster oxidation are largely insensitive to the presence of naphthalene and do not lead to formation of any of the known reactive Fe-oxygen species. By contrast, the role of the substrate becomes evident after Rieske cluster oxidation and exclusively for the 6-coordinate non-heme Fe
 sites in that the additional electron is found at the substrate instead of at the iron and oxygen atoms. Our results imply an allosteric control of the substrate on Rieske dioxygenase reactivity to happen prior to changes at the non-heme Fe
 in agreement with a strategy that avoids unproductive 
 activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Topologically&#8208;Interlocked Minicircles as Probes of DNA Topology and DNA&#8208;Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA minicircles exist in biological contexts, such as kinetoplast DNA, and are promising components for creating functional nanodevices. They have been used to mimic the topological features of nucleosomal DNA and to probe DNA&#8208;protein interactions such as HIV&#8208;1 and PFV integrases, and DNA gyrase. Here, we synthesized the topologically&#8208;interlocked minicircle rotaxane and catenane inside a frame&#8208;shaped DNA origami. These minicircles are 183 bp in length, constitute six individual single&#8208;stranded DNAs that are ligated to realize duplex interlocking, and adopt temporary base pairing of single strands for interlocking. To probe the DNA&#8208;protein interactions, restriction reactions were carried out on DNAs with different topologies such as free linear duplex or duplex constrained inside origami and free or topologically&#8208;interlocked minicircles. Except the free linear duplex, all tested structures were resistant to restriction digestion, indicating that the topological features of DNA, such as flexibility, curvature, and groove orientation, play a major role in DNA&#8208;protein interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Tautomerization in Pyridine&#8208;Fused Phosphorus&#8208;Nitrogen Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inclusion of a second nitrogen atom in the aromatic core of phosphorus&#8208;nitrogen (PN) heterocycles results in unexpected tautomerization to a nonaromatic form. This tautomerization, initially observed in the solid&#8208;state through X&#8208;ray crystallography, is also explained by computational analysis. We prepared an electron deficient analogue (  2e  ) with a fluorine on the pyridine ring and showed that the weakly basic pyridine resisted tautomerization, providing key insights to why the transformation occurs. To study the difference in solution vs. solid&#8208;state heterocycles, alkylated analogues that lock in the quinoidal tautomer were synthesized and their different  1  H NMR and UV&#8208;Vis spectra studied. Ultimately, we determined that all heterocycles are the aromatic tautomer in solution and all but  2e  switch to the quinoidal tautomer in the solid state. Better understanding of this transformation and under what circumstances it occurs suggest future use in a switchable on/off hydrogen&#8208;bond directed receptor that can be tuned for complementary hydrogen&#8208;bonding motif .</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of intermolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions in a CuI8PdII1 discrete assembly: conformers&#8217; geometries and stimuli&#8208;sensitive luminescence properties.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new highly solid&#8208;state luminescent phase of a previously reported weakly luminescent Cu  I  8  Pd  II  1  dicationic assembly is reported revealing the high geometrical versatility of this moiety that importantly alters its luminescent properties. This very minor new species  B  c  is based on a different conformer scaffold than the one encountered in the previously reported  B  o  form and, essentially differs from  B  o  by displaying shorter Cu  I  &#8208;Cu  I  intermetallic distances. DFT calculations allow concluding that the predominance in the solid&#8208;state of the weakly luminescent and less stable  B  o  phase is due to the extra stability induced by a larger number of intermolecular non&#8208;covalent &#960;&#8208;CH interactions in its crystalline packing and not by the intrinsic stability of the Cu  I  8  Pd  II  1  dicationic moiety. Calculations also revealed that a more stable conformation  B  calc  is expected in vacuum, which bears a different distribution of Cu  I  &#8208;Cu  I  intermetallic distances than the dications in  B  o  and  B  c  phases. Taking into account that the geometrical alterations are associated to drastic changes of luminescence properties, this confer to the Cu  I  8  Pd  II  1  assembly high potentiality as stimuli&#8208;sensitive luminescent materials. Indeed, by applying mechanical or thermal stress to samples of  B  o  phase, new phases  B  g  and  B  m  , respectively, were obtained. Alterations of the solid&#8208;state photophysical properties of these new species compared to those recorded for  B  o  are reported together with a combined experimental and computed study of the structures/properties relationships observed in these phases.</dc:description>

Due to the oxygen-driven reversible Ce3+/Ce4+  couple sites, the ''Fenton-like'' effect by iron centers, the ''nanoscale proximity''&#160;effects by nanocages, and their synergistic effects, FC-66(n) as INAzymes exhibit elegant cascade enzyme-mimic activities (oxidase-, peroxidase-, and Fenton-like activity). By employing dopamine (DA) detection as a model reaction, a high-efficient fluorescent "turning-on-enhanced" platform under near neutral conditions was established.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unexpected acid&#8208;triggered formation of reversibly photoswitchable Stenhouse salts from Donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse Adducts (DASAs) are reversibly photoswitchable dyes able to interconvert between a red/NIR absorbing triene&#8208;like state and a colorless cyclic state. Although optically attractive for multiple applications, their low solubility and lack of photoswitching in water impede their use in aqueous environments. We developed water&#8208;soluble DASAs based on indoline as donor and methyl, or trifluoromethyl, pyrazolone&#8208;based acceptors. In acetonitrile, photophysical analysis and photochemical studies accounted with a three&#8208;state kinetic model confirmed the reversible photoswitching mechanism previously proposed. In water, the colorless cyclic state is a thermodynamic sink at neutral pHs. In contrast, in acidic conditions, we observed a fast scrambling of DASAs'&#160;end&#8208;group resulting into the in&#8208;situ&#160;formation of Stenhouse salts (StS) which are in turn, capable of reversible photoswitching. We believe that this unexpected result is of interest not only for the future design of DASAs with improved stability, but also for further development and applications of StS as photoswitchable probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrogen donor protection for atomically precise metal nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface organic ligands are critical in dictating the structures and properties of atomically precise metal nanoclusters. In contrast to the conventionally used thiolate, phosphine and alkynyl ligands, nitrogen donor ligands have not been used in the protection for well&#8208;defined metal nanoclusters until recently. This minireview focuses on recent developments in atomically precise metal nanoclusters stabilized by different types of nitrogen donor ligands, in which the synthesis, total structure determination and various properties are covered. We hope that this review will provide insights into the rational design of N donor&#8208;protected metal nanoclusters in terms of structural and functional modulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Wavelength Orthogonal Photodynamic Networks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability of light to remotely control the properties of soft matter materials in a dynamic fashion has fascinated material scientists and photochemists for decades. However, only recently has our ability to map photochemical reactivity in a finely wavelength resolved fashion allowed for different colors of light to independently control the material properties of polymer networks with high precision, driven by monochromatic irradiation enabling orthogonal reaction control. The current concept article highlights the progress in visible light&#8208;enabled photochemistry and explores how it has enabled the design of polymer networks with dynamically adjustable properties. We will explore current applications ranging from dynamic hydrogel design to the light driven adaptation of 3D printed structures on the macro&#8208; and micro&#8208;scale. While the alternation of mechanical properties via remote control is largely reality for soft matter materials, we herein propose the next frontiers for adaptive properties, including remote switching between conductive and non&#8208;conductive properties, hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces, fluorescent or non&#8208;fluorescent, and cell adhesive vs cell repellent properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenylene&#8208;Bridged Perylene Monoimides as Acceptors for Organic Solar Cells &#8211; A Study on the Structure&#8208;Properties Relationship</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors based on perylene monoimides coupled in the peri position through phenylene linkers were synthesized via Suzuki&#8208;coupling reactions. Various substitution patterns were investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations in combination with experimental data to elucidate the geometry and their optical and electrochemical properties. Further investigations of the bulk properties with grazing incidence wide angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS) gave insight into the stacking behavior of the acceptor thin films. Electrochemical and morphological properties correlate with the photovoltaic performance of devices with the polymeric donor PBDB&#8208;T and a maximum efficiency of 3.17% was reached. The study gives detailed information about structure&#8208;properties relationships of perylene&#8208;linker&#8208;perylene compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Intramolecular P/Al&#8208;based FLPs via Aluminium&#8208;Tin&#8208;Exchange and their Reactivity toward CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) composed of acidic alane and basic phosphane functions, separated by a xanthene linker, can be prepared through the corresponding Me  3  Sn derivative and methyl aluminum compounds with elimination of Me  4  Sn. This way MeClAl&#8208;, Cl  2  Al&#8208; and (C  6  F  5  )  2  Al&#8208; moieties could be introduced and the resulting FLPs are stabilized by a further equivalent of the alane precursors. In contact with the FLPs CO  2  is bound via the C atom at the phosphane functions and the two O atoms at the Al centers. The residues at the latter determine the binding strength. Hence, in case of MeClAl CO  2  capture occurs at higher pressure and under ambient conditions CO  2  is released again, while for MeClAl and (C  6  F  5  )  2  Al CO  2  binding becomes irreversible. The results of DFT calculations rationalize these findings by the high thermodynamic stabilization in case of more electronegative residues, which concomitantly lead to higher barriers, and in case of (C  6  F  5  )  2  Al further stabilization is achieved through a low reorganization energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Syntheses of Anthracene&#8208;centered Large PAH Diimides and Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structures with suitable electron&#8208;withdrawing groups are useful building blocks for developing optical and electron&#8208;transporting materials. Here, we report the application of double benzannulation processes to synthesize PAH diimides with enlarged &#960;&#8208;frameworks featuring a central anthracene moiety. The processes are realized by copper&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] cycloaddition of ethynyl&#8208;substituted aromatic dicarobximide to 2,5&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)terephthalaldehyde, followed by intramolecular photocyclization or direct arylation via Heck cross coupling. Specifically, A central symmetric benzo[1,2&#8208;  k  :4,5&#8208;  k  ']&#8208;bis(fluoranthene)&#8208;3,4,12,13&#8208;tetracarboxyl diimide (BFDI) is acquired, with a single crystal revealing its completely planar polycyclic skeleton. Such a shape&#8208;persistent PAH expectedly exhibits a tendency to stack face&#8208;to&#8208;face and forms J&#8208;aggregates. Moreover, BFDI can be expediently difunctionalized site&#8208;selectively in reactive 9 and 10 positions of the anthracene unit and applied to prepare conjugated polymers. When coupled with 1,4&#8208;diketopyrrolo[3,4&#8208;  c  ]&#8208;pyrrole (DPP) via thiophene and dithiophene linkers, two significantly broadened absorption bands extended to the near&#8208;infrared regime appear, evidencing the effective &#960;&#8208;conjugative extension ability of BFDI unit.</dc:description>

         <title>Dielectric and Magnetic Relaxations Exhibited in a 2D Parallel Interpenetrating Frustrated Star Net</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using organic ammonium HDMPDA (DMPDA=N, N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanediamine) with a positive charge, a complex [HDMPDA][Fe6(&#956;3&#8208;O)2(&#956;&#8208;O2CH)15] (1) with a 2D parallel interpenetrating &#8220;star&#8221; net was successfully obtained. The complex exhibits properties as a frustrated material with TN=4.2&#8197;K, and also presents new functions with dielectric and slow magnetic relaxations.







Abstract
Constructing multiple functional geometric frustration magnets is a hot topic in solid state chemistry and material science. Herein, a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) parallel interpenetrating &#8220;star&#8221; net complex [HDMPDA][Fe6(&#956;3&#8208;O)2(&#956;&#8208;O2CH)15] (1) was obtained successfully with HDMPDA (DMPDA=N, N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanediamine) as charge balancer. The dipole reorientation of the rotator [HDMPDA]+ in the complex brings a structure transition which leads dielectric relaxation close to room temperature. Despite strong antiferromagnetic coupling existing between ions in the net, long&#8208;range order temperature TN of the complex is suppressed to 4.2&#8197;K by geometric frustration. Interestingly, below TN, a canted antiferromagnetic state, accompanied with slow magnetic relaxation, is detected due to the lack of enough magnetic coupling between 2D layers. Thus, 1 is a particular multifunctional magnetic frustration material containing two different types of relaxations.

         <title>Parasitic Light Absorption, Rate Laws and Heterojunctions in the Photocatalytic Oxidation of Arsenic(III) Using Composite TiO2/Fe2O3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanisms that control the kinetics of arsenic(III) photocatalytic oxidation when meso&#8208;TiO2 is coupled with an Fe2O3 adsorbent phase are investigated herein. Parasitic light absorption is the primary factor, followed by changes in rate law (from disguised zero&#8208;order to first order). Charge transfer across the heterojunction in our material is negligible.







Abstract
Composite photocatalyst&#8208;adsorbents such as TiO2/Fe2O3 are promising materials for the one&#8208;step treatment of arsenite contaminated water. However, no previous study has investigated how coupling TiO2 with Fe2O3 influences the photocatalytic oxidation of arsenic(III). Herein, we develop new hybrid experiment/modelling approaches to study light absorption, charge carrier behaviour and changes in the rate law of the TiO2/Fe2O3 system, using UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS), and kinetic analysis. Whilst coupling TiO2 with Fe2O3 improves total arsenic removal by adsorption, oxidation rates significantly decrease (up to a factor of 60), primarily due to the parasitic absorption of light by Fe2O3 (88&#8201;% of photons at 368&#8197;nm) and secondly due to changes in the rate law from disguised zero&#8208;order kinetics to first&#8208;order kinetics. Charge transfer across this TiO2&#8208;Fe2O3 heterojunction is not observed. Our study demonstrates the first application of a multi&#8208;adsorbate surface complexation model (SCM) towards describing As(III) oxidation kinetics which, unlike Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood kinetics, includes the competitive adsorption of As(V). We further highlight the importance of parasitic light absorption and catalyst fouling when designing heterogeneous photocatalysts for As(III) remediation.

         <title>Dye&#8208;Conjugated Spinach RNA by Genetic Alphabet Expansion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light emission by dye&#8208;conjugated Spinach RNA transcripts can be generated by genetic alphabet expansion. Dye&#8208;conjugated unnatural base substrates are site&#8208;specifically incorporated into Spinach RNA opposite to its unnatural base pairing partner in DNA templates by T7 transcription. The dye&#8208;conjugated Spinach RNAs or shorter versions robustly emit fluorescence.







Abstract
Light&#8208;emitting systems using an RNA aptamer&#8208;dye pair, such as Spinach RNA, are an attractive method for imaging and tracing RNA expression in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. We present an alternative Spinach method by genetic alphabet expansion using an unnatural base pair system, in which a dye&#8208;conjugated unnatural base substrate is site&#8208;specifically incorporated at a specific position in Spinach RNA by transcription involving the third base pair. The incorporation position was predicted by molecular dynamics simulations. This dye&#8208;conjugated Spinach RNA increased the thermal stability of the fluorescence, the robustness against ion sensitivity, and the resistance against photobleaching. Furthermore, we applied our method to Baby Spinach, a shorter version of Spinach, for dye conjugation toward the visible detection of transcripts. This is the first demonstration of an alternative RNA imaging method for a detection system using genetic alphabet expansion.

         <title>Disordered Low Molecular Weight Spiropyran Exhibiting Photoregulated Adhesion Ability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoresponsive adhesives are attractive functional materials. Differentiating from the reported azobenzene&#8208;containing adhesives with photoswitched adhesion&#8208;on or off property, a low molecular weight spiropyran that could exhibit photoregulated adhesion ability in multiple levels is disclosed in this work. In disordered solid state, the reported spiropyran could also gain photochromism with five different color states, which show one&#8208;to&#8208;one correspondence to the adhesion ability. This work provides a new strategy for developing functional materials by employing low molecular weight compounds.







Abstract
The functions of the materials composed of small molecules are highly dependent on their ordered molecular arrangements in both natural and artificial systems. Without ordered structure, small molecules hardly gain complicated functions, due to the absence of intermolecular covalent bond connection or strong network. Here, a low molecular weight spiropyran that could exhibit attractive photochromism and powerful adhesion property in disordered solid state is demonstrated. With maximum up to &#8764;8&#8197;MPa, the adhesion strength could be photoregulated in multiple levels, which also shows one&#8208;to&#8208;one correspondence to the specific color state. The working mechanism analysis on the photoregulated adhesion reveals that the isomer ratio of merocyanine form and the molecular packing density of spiropyran are the determining factors for the adhesion ability. The discovery of photoregulated adhesion from pure spiropyran provides a new strategy for developing functional materials by employing low molecular weight compounds.

         <title>Direct Crystallization of Diamine Radical Cations: Carbon&#8208;Nitrogen Bond Formation from the Reaction of Triphenylamine with TiCl4, TiBr4, or SnCl4 versus Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Formation with SbCl5**
</title>

         <dc:description>
The direct synthesis of diamine radical cations in crystalline form produced through oxidation of triphenylamine followed by the formation of either a C&#8722;N or a C&#8208;C bond is reported. Although the oxidative coupling of triphenylamine is well studied, diamine products are rarely captured in their radical cation state. The neutral diamine most frequently obtained from this reaction pathway is N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetraphenylbenzidine. Herein, the capture of radical cations of diamines in crystalline form in one step starting with neutral triphenylamine was demonstrated, and the formation of two products (the radical cations of N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenediamine or N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetraphenylbenzidine) depending on the oxidizing agent used was observed.

         <title>Prelithiation Reagents and Strategies on High Energy Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of prelithiation is an effective pathway to supply Li source for compensating the lithium loss in the first cycle, thus promoting the energy density of batteries. This review outlines the chemical and electrochemical prelithiation methods for anodes and cathodes, with particularly discussion on the complexity of different prelithiation reagents/strategies and corresponding lithiation degree reached.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely employed in energy&#8208;storage applications owing to the relatively higher energy density and longer cycling life. However, they still need further improvement especially on the energy density to satisfy the increasing demands on the market. In this respect, the irreversible capacity loss (ICL) in the initial cycle is a critical challenge due to the lithium loss during the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the anode surface. The strategy of prelithiation was then proposed to compensate for the ICL in the anode and recover the energy density. Here, various methods of the prelithiation are summarized and classified according to the basic working mechanism. Further, considering the critical importance and promising progress of prelithiation in both fundamental research and real applications, this Review article is intended to discuss the considerations involved in the selection of prelithiation reagents/strategies and the electrochemical performance in full&#8208;cells. Moreover, insights are provided regarding the practical application prospects and the challenges that still need to be addressed.

         <title>Tuning Diradical Properties of Boron&#8208;Containing &#960;&#8208;Systems by Structural Isomerism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A boron&#8208;containing polycyclic hydrocarbon was synthesized via the precise borylation of the &#946;&#8208;carbons of indeno[1,2&#8208;b]fluorene. Because of the efficient conjugation between the boron atoms and &#960;&#8208;skeleton, this molecule exhibits downshifted energy levels, blue&#8208;shifted light absorption, smaller diradical character and weak paramagnetic resonance in comparison to its isomeric molecule, thus demonstrating the significant electronic effects of structural isomerism on diradical properties.







Abstract
Tuning diradical character is an important topic for organic diradicaloids. Herein, we report the precise borylation enabling structural isomerism as an effective strategy to modulate diradical character and thereby properties of organic diradicaloids. We synthesized a new B&#8208;containing polycyclic hydrocarbon that has the indeno[1,2&#8208;b]fluorene &#960;&#8208;skeleton with the &#946;&#8208;carbons bonding to two boron atoms. Detailed theoretical and experimental results show that this bonding pattern leads to its distinctive electronic structures and properties in comparison to that of its isomeric molecule. This molecule has the efficient conjugation between boron atoms and &#960;&#8208;skeleton, resulting in downshifted LUMO and HOMO levels. Moreover, it exhibits smaller diradical character and thereby inhibited diradical properties, such as significantly blue&#8208;shifted light absorption, larger energy bandgap and weak para&#8208;magnetic resonance. Notably, this B&#8208;containing polycyclic hydrocarbon possesses much stronger Lewis acidity and its Lewis acid&#8208;base adducts display enhanced diradical character, demonstrating the positive effects of Lewis coordination on modulating diradical performance.

         <title>Role of Anionic Backbone in NHC&#8208;Stabilized Coinage Metal Complexes: New Precursors for Atomic Layer Deposition
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of new N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) based Cu(I) and Ag(I) complexes were synthesized, analyzed, and evaluated for their potential usage in atomic layer deposition (ALD) of coinage metal thin films. Employing the same set of diketonate&#8208;type ligands for both metals did result in thermally stable Cu(I) complexes suitable for ALD, while the Ag(I) complexes exhibit an inherently unstable nature and different bonding features. More information can be found in the Research Article by Anjana Devi et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103798).

         <title>From light to structure:&#160;Photo initiators in two&#8208;photon polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;photon polymerization (2PP) represents a powerful technique for the fabrication of precise three&#8208;dimensional structures on a micro&#8208; and nanometer scale for various applications. While many review articles are focusing on the used polymeric materials and their application in 2PP, to this date no review has discussed the class of two&#8208;photon photo initiators (2PI) in detail. Because the demand for highly efficient 2PI has increased in the last decades, different approaches in designing new efficient 2PIs occurred. This review summarizes the 2PIs known in literature and discusses their absorption behavior under one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) conditions, their two&#8208;photon cross sections&#160;as well as their efficiency under 2PP conditions. Here, the photo initiators are grouped depending on their chromophore system.&#160;In addition, the upcoming class of water&#8208;soluble photo initiators for tissue engineering will be discussed in detail. Their polymerization efficiencies are evaluated by fabrication windows (FW) depending on different laser intensities and writing speeds.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanded Mercaptocalixarenes: A New Kind of Macrocyclic Ligands for Stabilization of Polynuclear Thiolate Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The syntheses and properties of expanded 4&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butyl&#8208;mercapto&#8208;calix[4]arenes, in which the methylene linkers are replaced by &#8208;CH  2  NRCH  2  &#8208; or &#8208;CH  2  NRCH  2  &#8208; and CH  2  NRCH  2  CH  2  CH  2  NRCH  2  &#8208; units, are described. The new macrocycles were obtained in a step&#8208;wise manner, utilizing fully protected, i.e. S&#8208;alkylated, derivatives of the oxidation&#8208;sensitive thiophenols in the cyclisation steps. Reductive cleavage of the macrobicyclic or macrotricyclic intermediates (  6  ,  7  ,  11  ) afforded the free thiophenols (H  4  8  , H  4  9  , and H  4  12  ) in preparative yields as their hydrochloride salts. The protected proligands can exist in two conformations, resembling the &#8220;cone&#8221; and &#8220;1,3&#8208;alternate&#8221; conformations found for the parent calix[4]arenes. The free macro&#8208;cycles do not show conformational isomerism, but are readily oxidized forming intramolecular disulfide linkages. Preliminary complexation experiments show that these expanded mercaptocalixarenes can serve as supporting ligands for tetranuclear thiolato clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Encapsulation of trimethine cyanine in cucurbit[8]uril: solution versus solid&#8208;state inclusion behavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inclusion of polymethine cyanine dyes in the cavity of macrocyclic receptors is an effective strategy to alter their absorption and emission behavior in aqueous solution. In this paper, the effect of the host&#8208;guest interaction between cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) and a model trimethine indocyanine (Cy3) on dye spectral properties and aggregation in water is investigated. Solution studies, performed by a combination of spectroscopic and calorimetric techniques, indicate that the addition of CB[8] disrupts Cy3 aggregates leading to the formation of a 1:1 host&#8208;guest complex with an association constant of 1.5 &#215; 10  6  M  &#8722;1  . At concentrations suitable for NMR experiments, the slow formation of a supramolecular polymer was observed, followed by precipitation. Single crystals X&#8208;ray structure elucidation confirmed the formation of a polymer with 1:1 stoichiometry in the solid state.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure engineering of BiSbSx nanocrystals embedded within sulfurized polyacrylonitrile fibers for high performance of potassium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are regarded as promising candidates in next&#8208;generation energy storage technology; however, the electrode materials in PIBs are usually restricted by the shortcomings of large volume expansion and poor cycling stability stemming from a high resistance towards diffusion and insertion of large&#8208;sized K ions. In this study, BiSbSx  nanocrystals are rationally integrated with sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) fibres&#160;through electrospinning technology with an annealing process. Such a unique structure, in which BiSbSx  nanocrystals are embedded inside the SPAN fibre, affords multiple binding sites and a short diffusion length for K+  to realize fast kinetics. In addition, the molecular structure of SPAN features robust chemical interactions for stationary diffluent discharge products. Thus, the electrode demonstrates a superior potassium storage performance with an&#160;excellent reversible capacity of 790 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;(at 0.1 A g&#8208;1  after 50 cycles) and&#160;and 472 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;(at 1 A g&#8208;1  after 2000 cycles).&#160;It's one of the best performances for metal dichalcogenides anodes for PIBs to date. The unusual performance of the BiSbSx@SPAN composite is attributed to the synergistic effects of the judicious nanostructure engineering of BiSbSx&#160;nanocrystals as well as the chemical interaction and confinement of SPAN fibres.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and photophysical properties of 1,1,4,4&#8208;tetracyanobutadienes derived from ynamides bearing fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,1,4,4&#8208;Tetracyanobutadienes (TCBDs) bearing a large diversity of fluorophores were prepared following a multi&#8208;step synthesis. In a crucial last step, all compounds were obtained from the corresponding ynamides, which were particularly suitable for the formation of the TCBDs in the presence of tetracyanoethylene via a [2+2] cycloaddition/retroelectrocyclization step (CA&#8208;RE). Several fluorenyl derivatives in addition to phenanthrenyl and terphenyl ones provided ynamide&#8208;based TCBDs affording remarkable emission properties covering a large range of wavelengths. Those compounds emit both in solid state and in solution from the visible region to the NIR range, depending on the molecular structures. Quantum yields in cyclohexane reached unforeseen values for such derivatives, up to 7.8%. A huge sensitivity to the environment of the TCBDs has also been unraveled for most of the compounds since we observed a dramatic fall of the quantum yields when changing the solvent from cyclohexane to toluene, while they are almost non&#8208;emissive in dichloromethane.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Cycloaromatization Route to Cycloparaphenylenes that Exhibit Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>N&#8208;Terminal Selective C&#8722;H Azidation of Proline&#8208;Containing Peptides: a Platform for Late&#8208;Stage Diversification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selective C&#8722;H azidation of up to 6 amino acids long proline&#8208;containing peptides is reported. In each example, the N&#8208;terminal residue was selectively functionalized even in presence of amino acids bearing tertiary aliphatic, benzylic and &#945; to heteroatoms C&#8722;H bonds. The azidated products were used in cycloaddition reactions and as masked imines for new C&#8722;C bond formations, allowing an easy access to diversified peptide scaffolds.







Abstract
A methodology for the C&#8722;H azidation of N&#8208;terminal proline&#8208;containing peptides was developed employing only commercially available reagents. Peptides bearing a broad range of functionalities and containing up to 6 amino acids were selectively azidated at the carbamate&#8208;protected N&#8208;terminal residue in presence of the numerous other functional groups present on the molecules. Post&#8208;functionalizations of the obtained aminal compounds were achieved: cycloaddition reactions or C&#8722;C bond formations via a sequence of imine formation/nucleophilic addition were performed, offering an easy access to diversified peptides.

         <title>Cellular Detection of a Mitochondria Targeted Brominated Vinyl Triphenylamine Optical Probe (TP&#8722;Br) by X&#8208;Ray Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed and synthesized a new bimodal vinyltriphenylamine probe. TP&#8722;Br is an off&#8208;on fluorescent probe that targets mitochondria thanks to its lipophilic cationic structure. The probe was imaged by two modalities in cells: by one&#8208;photon or two&#8208;photon excitation fluorescence microscopy and by Scanning Synchrotron Radiation X&#8208;ray Fluorescence.







Abstract
Triphenylamine (TP) derivatives such as two&#8208;branch cationic vinylbenzimidazolium triphenylamine TP&#8722;2Bzim are promising turn&#8208;on fluorescent probes suitable for two&#8208;photon imaging, labelling mitochondria in live cells. Here, we designed two TP&#8722;2Bzim derivatives as bimodal probes suitable for X&#8208;ray fluorescence imaging. The conjugation of the TP core with a rhenium tricarbonyl moiety in the TP&#8722;RePyta probe altered the localisation in live cells from mitochondria to lysosomes. The introduction of bromine on the TP core generated the TP&#8722;Br probe retaining good photophysical properties and mitochondria labelling in live cells. The influence of calcium channels in the uptake of TP&#8722;Br was studied. Synchrotron Radiation X&#8208;ray Fluorescence (SXRF) imaging of bromine enabled the detection of TP&#8722;Br and suggested a negligible presence of the probe in an unbound state in the incubated cells, a crucial point in the development of these probes. This study paves the way towards the development of TP probes as specific organelle stainers suitable for SXRF imaging.

         <title>Efficient Photocatalytic Carbonyl Alkylative Amination Enabled by Titanium&#8208;Dioxide&#8208;Mediated Decarboxylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient nano TiO2&#8208;mediated carbonyl alkylative amination that proceeds by heterogeneous photoredox catalysis is reported. The use of nano titanium dioxide as photocatalyst allows efficient synthesis of diverse amines in good to excellent yields. Mechanistic studies reveal a single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer mechanism involving the photoexcitation of TiO2 to generate alkyl radicals from carboxylic acids decarboxylation.







Abstract
Herein, a heterogeneous carbonyl alkylative amination reaction that proceeds by photoredox catalysis has been developed. The use of nano titanium dioxide (TiO2, 25&#8197;nm) as photocatalyst allows efficient synthesis of diverse amines in good to excellent yields. Mechanistic studies reveal a single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer mechanism involving the photoexcitation of TiO2 to generate alkyl radicals from carboxylic acids decarboxylation. This protocol highlights the utility of using heterogeneous semiconductor photocatalysts to promote a practical and general synthesis of complex amines from readily available feedstocks.

         <title>Induced Near&#8208;Infrared Emission and Controlled Photooxidation based on Sulfonated Crown Ether in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;soluble sulfonated crown ether makes very strong host&#8208;guest encapsulation with a set of push&#8208;pull&#8208;type dyes, which can greatly enhance the fluorescence emission from visible to near&#8208;infrared regions and significantly suppress the 1O2 generation and concomitant photooxidation ability of photosensitizers in aqueous media.







Abstract
Regulation of physio&#8208;chemical properties and reaction activities via noncovalent methodology has become one of increasingly significant topics in supramolecular chemistry and showed inventive applications in miscellaneous fields. Herein, we demonstrate that sulfonated crown ether can form very stable host&#8208;guest complexes with a series of push&#8208;pull&#8208;type photosensitizers, eventually leading to the dramatic fluorescence enhancement in visible and near&#8208;infrared regions. Meanwhile, severe suppression in singlet oxygen (1O2) production is found, mainly due to the higher energy barriers between the excited single and triple states upon host&#8208;guest complexation. Moreover, such complexation&#8208;induced tuneable 1O2 generation systems has been utilized in adjusting the photochemical oxidation reactions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (anthracene) and sulfides ((methylthio)benzene) in water. This supramolecularly controlled photooxidation based on the selective molecular binding of crown ether with photosensitizers may provide a feasible and applicable strategy for monitoring and modulating many photocatalysis processes in aqueous phase.

This protocol proceeds via a photoinduced electron transfer process of electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor complex between sulfinates and heteroaryl chlorides, enabling facile excess to &#946;&#8208;sulfonyl and &#946;&#8208;fluoromethyl &#945;&#8208;oxy alkyl heteroaromatics under mild and catalyst&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
We report a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced three&#8208;component sulfonyl&#8208;heteroarylation of vinyl ethers with sulfinates and five&#8208;membered heteroaryl chlorides. This protocol proceeds via electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes between sulfinates and heteroaryl chlorides, giving &#946;&#8208;sulfonyl alkyl five&#8208;membered heteroarenes with high efficiency and excellent regioselectivity under mild and catalyst&#8208;free conditions. Utilization of CF3SO2Na or CF2HSO2Na as coupling partners further achieves three&#8208;component fluoromethyl&#8208;arylation of vinyl ethers, furnishing a series of valuable CF3/CF2H&#8208;incorporated alkyl heterocycles under mild conditions.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Heterocyclic Chloroamines and Aziridines by Enantioselective Protonation of Catalytically Generated Enamines**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis enables the synthesis of chiral vicinal chloroamines via asymmetric protonation of catalytically generated prochiral chloroenamines. The process is highly enantioselective, with the origin of asymmetry and catalyst substituent effects elucidated by DFT calculations. The method allows access to rare heterocycle&#8208;substituted vicinal chloroamines, aziridines, and vicinal diamines.







Abstract
We report a method for the synthesis of chiral vicinal chloroamines via asymmetric protonation of catalytically generated prochiral chloroenamines using chiral Br&#248;nsted acids. The process is highly enantioselective, with the origin of asymmetry and catalyst substituent effects elucidated by DFT calculations. We show the utility of the method as an approach to the synthesis of a broad range of heterocycle&#8208;substituted aziridines by treatment of the chloroamines with base in a one&#8208;pot process, as well as the utility of the process to allow access to vicinal diamines.

         <title>Sequential Visible Light&#8208;Induced Reactions Using Different Photocatalysts: Transformation of Furans into 2&#8208;Pyridones via &#947;&#8208;Lactams Using a New Ring Expansion Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic ring expansion reaction that transforms &#947;&#8208;lactams into 2&#8208;pyridones has been developed. This expansion was incorporated into a multi&#8208;photocatalyst one pot process that starts from readily accessible furans and uses two metal&#8208;free photocatalysts (methylene blue and eosin). The photocatalytic cleavage of C&#8722;I bonds activated by an electron donor at the neighbouring carbon is achieved, using eosin as photocatalyst.







Abstract
A new photocatalytic ring expansion reaction that transforms &#947;&#8208;lactams into 2&#8208;pyridones is described. The reaction is radical&#8208;triggered and was inspired by a late&#8208;stage oxidation commonly observed in fungal metabolism. The reaction is particularly powerful because it can be included in a one pot process which converts readily accessible furans directly into 2&#8208;pyridones through sequential photo&#8208;induced reactions (energy transfer and electron transfer). The study also unveiled unprecedented reactivity for the mild and metal&#8208;free photocatalyst eosin, wherein it is used to cleave a C&#8722;I bond activated only by an electron donor on the neighbouring carbon.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A total synthesis of the cyclic lipodepsipeptide natural product orfamide A was achieved. By developing a synthesis format using an aminoacid ester building block and SPPS protocol adaptation, a focused library of target compounds was obtained, in high yield and purity. Spectral and LC&#8208;HRMS data of all library members with the isolated natural product identified the  5  Leu residue to be  d  &#8208; and the 3&#8217;&#8208;OH group to be  R  &#8208;configured. The structural correction of orfamide A by chemical synthesis and analysis was confirmed by biological activity comparison in  Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  , which indicated compound configuration to be important for bioactivity. Acute toxicity was also found against  Trypanosoma brucei  , the parasite causing African sleeping sickness.</dc:description>

         <title>Developing Flexible Quinacridone&#8208;Derivatives&#8208;Based Photothermal Evaporaters for Solar Steam and Thermoelectric Power Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic molecule (DCN&#8722;4CQA) with the absorbance region at 300&#8211;800&#8197;nm and photothermal conversion efficiency of 18.2&#8201;% under one sun was employed for fabricating flexible photothermal evaporators for solar steam and thermoelectric power generation.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven interfacial vaporization by localizing solar&#8208;thermal energy conversion to the air&#8722;water interface has attracted tremendous attention. In the process of converting solar energy into heat energy, photothermal materials play an essential role. Herein, a flexible solar&#8208;thermal material di&#8208;cyan substituted 5,12&#8208;dibutylquinacridone (DCN&#8722;4CQA)@Paper was developed by coating photothermal quinacridone derivatives on the cellulose paper. The DCN&#8722;4CQA@Paper combines desired chemical and physical properties, broadband light&#8208;absorbing, and shape&#8208;conforming abilities that render efficient photothermic vaporization. Notably, synergetic coupling of solar&#8208;steam and solar&#8208;electricity technologies by integrating DCN&#8722;4CQA@Paper and the thermoelectric devices is realized without trade&#8208;offs, highlighting the practical consideration toward more impactful solar heat exploitation. Such solar distillation and low&#8208;grade heat&#8208;to&#8208;electricity generation functions can provide potential opportunities for fresh water and electricity supply in off&#8208;grid or remote areas.

         <title>Stereochemical Behavior of Pairs of P&#8208;stereogenic Phosphanyl Groups at the Dimethylxanthene Backbone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pair of vinyl phosphanyl substituents at the dimethylxanthene backbone undergoes a rather rapid epimerization reaction with a DFT calculated meso to rac isomerization barrier of ca. 22&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The low inversion barrier at phosphorus is likely due to a &#960;&#8208;conjugative effect. The addition of the strong Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 to the P&#8208;stereogenic phosphane probably proceeds through a reactive phospha&#8208;iminium intermediate with loss of the stereochemical information.







Abstract
The P&#8208;stereogenic bis(phosphanes) 7 and 9, featuring pairs of P(Mes)&#8208;ethynyl or vinyl substituents at the dimethyl xanthene backbone show rather low barriers of stereochemical inversion at phosphorus. &#960;&#8208;Conjugative effects are probably causing these low inversion barriers. Compound 7 reacted with B(C6F5)3 to form the nine&#8208;membered heterocyclic product 10, featuring a [P]&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;B(C6F5)3 substituent. Compound 7 was converted to the bis[P(Mes)vinyl] xanthene derivative 9, which gave the zwitterionic P(H)(Mes)&#8722;CH=CH&#8722;B(C6F5)3 containing product 16 upon treatment with B(C6F5)3. Thermally induced epimerization barriers at phosphorus of ca. 20 to 27&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 were calculated by DFT for the alkenyl&#8208; and alkynyl&#8208;P derived systems 6 to 9, 15 and 16 and experimentally determined for the examples 7 and 16.

     alt="Stereochemical Behavior of Pairs of P-stereogenic Phosphanyl Groups at the Dimethylxanthene Backbone"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The pair of vinyl&lt;/b&gt; phosphanyl substituents at the dimethylxanthene backbone undergoes a rather rapid epimerization reaction with a DFT calculated meso to rac isomerization barrier of ca. 22&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The low inversion barrier at phosphorus is likely due to a &#960;-conjugative effect. The addition of the strong Lewis acid B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to the P-stereogenic phosphane probably proceeds through a reactive phospha-iminium intermediate with loss of the stereochemical information.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The P-stereogenic bis(phosphanes) &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;, featuring pairs of P(Mes)-ethynyl or vinyl substituents at the dimethyl xanthene backbone show rather low barriers of stereochemical inversion at phosphorus. &#960;-Conjugative effects are probably causing these low inversion barriers. Compound &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt; reacted with B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to form the nine-membered heterocyclic product &lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt;, featuring a [P]&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; substituent. Compound &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt; was converted to the bis[P(Mes)vinyl] xanthene derivative &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;, which gave the zwitterionic P(H)(Mes)&#8722;CH=CH&#8722;B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; containing product &lt;b&gt;16&lt;/b&gt; upon treatment with B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Thermally induced epimerization barriers at phosphorus of ca. 20 to 27&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; were calculated by DFT for the alkenyl- and alkynyl-P derived systems &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;15&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;16&lt;/b&gt; and experimentally determined for the examples &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;16&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cyanide&#8208;Free Cyanation of sp2 and sp&#8208;Carbon Atoms by an Oxazole&#8208;Based Masked CN Source Using Flow Microreactors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8722;CN behind the mask: Continuous&#8208;flow methodology for versatile cyanide&#8208;free cyanation of C(sp2) and C(sp) carbons has been developed by in&#8197;situ generating a novel oxazole based (5&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenyloxazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl) boronic acid [OxBA] reagent as a non&#8208;toxic carbon&#8208;bound masked &#8722;CN source. The four&#8208;step flow sequence consisting of lithiation/borylation, Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling and [4+2]/retro&#8208;[4+2] produced medicinally important benzonitrile analogues with good to excellent yields.







Abstract
This work reports a cyanide&#8208;free continuous&#8208;flow process for cyanation of sp2 and sp carbons to synthesize aryl, vinyl and acetylenic nitriles from (5&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenyloxazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl) boronic acid [OxBA] reagent as a sole source of carbon&#8208;bound masked &#8722;CN source. Non&#8208;toxic and stable OxBA reagent is generated by lithiation&#8208;borylation of bromo&#8208;oxazole, and the consecutive Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling with aryl, vinyl, or acetylenic halides and demasking [4+2]/retro&#8208;[4+2] sequence were successfully accomplished to give the desired cyano compounds with reasonably good yields in a four&#8208;step flow manner. A unique feature of this cyanation protocol in flow enables to cyanate a variety of sp2 and sp carbons to produce a broad spectrum of aryl acetonitrile. It is envisaged that the OxBA based cyanation would replace existing unstable and toxic approaches as well as non&#8208;toxic cyanation using two different sources of &#8220;C&#8221; and &#8220;N&#8221; to incorporate the &#8722;CN group.

         <title>Unfolding the Role of Building Units of MOFs with Mechanistic Insight Towards Selective Metal Ions Detection in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The potential emergence of fluorescence&#8208;based techniques has propelled research towards developing probes that can sense trace metal ions specifically. Although luminescent metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) are well suited for this application, the role of building blocks towards detection is not fully understood. In this work, a systematic screening by varying number of Lewis basic (pyridyl&#8208;N atoms) sites is carried out in a series of isostructural, robust UiO&#8208;67 MOFs, and targeting a model metal ion &#8211; Fe  3+  . All the three fluorescent MOFs are seen to present quenching response towards Fe  3+  ions in water. However, UiO&#8208;67@N exhibits highly selective and sensitive response, whereas emission of both UiO&#8208;67 and UiO67@NN is quenched by several metal ions. Detailed experimental and theoretical mechanistic investigation is carried out in addition to demonstration of UiO&#8208;67@N being able to sense trace amount of Fe  3+  ions in synthetic biological water sample. Further, UiO&#8208;67@N based mixed&#8208;matrix membrane (MMM) has been prepared and employed to mimic the real time Fe  3+  ions detection in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the Potential of Hitherto Unexplored Base&#8208;Stabilized Borylenes in Dinitrogen Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Computational investigations were carried out to probe the potential of several dicoordinate, singly base&#8208;stabilized borylenes of the form [L&#8594;BR] (L = neutral Lewis base) in dinitrogen binding. The calculated reaction free energies and activation barriers associated with the formation of mono&#8208; and diborylene&#8208;N  2  adducts suggest the presence of thermally surmountable kinetic barriers towards their possible isolation. Our results show that the exergonicity of dinitrogen activation and fixation is linearly dependent on the natural charge at the boron center, which can be tuned to design novel boron&#8208;based compounds with potential applications to small&#8208;molecule activation. EDA&#8208;NOCV analysis reveals strong binding of dinitrogen to these base&#8208;stabilized borylenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;talk Between (Hydrogen)Sulfite and Metalloproteins: Impact on Human Health</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic effect of sulfite and metalloproteins is a significant correlation with human health. The role and fate of sulfite is discussed in different perspectives &#8208; as a toxic substance, its biochemical transformation by two key enzymes, sulfite oxidase (sulfite&#8208;to&#8208;sulfate) and sulfite reductase (sulfite&#8208;to&#8208;sulfide), formation of sulfite radical by heme proteins (peroxidases) and neutralization of toxic sulfite radicals by globins.







Abstract
Sulfite is a potent toxic substance causing harm to multi&#8208;organ in human. Despite toxicity, it is widely used as preservative, anti&#8208;browning and anti&#8208;oxidant in foods, beverages, and pharmaceuticals, which cause easy admission of sulfite in human. Sulfite is also produced endogenously during the catabolism of cysteine and methionine. In vivo, the serum sulfite level at physiological range is strictly maintained by a molybdenum dependent sulfite oxidase (SO), which catalyzes sulfite to sulfate oxidation via a two&#8208;electron oxidation pathway. The loss of SO activity causes high serum sulfite level that fosters several diseases, including asthma, neurological dysfunction, birth defects, and heart diseases. The cytotoxicity of (bi)sulfite is implicated as sulfite radicals, which are generated by mainly heme&#8208;peroxidases via a one&#8208;electron oxidation pathway. On the other hand, the toxic sulfite radicals are neutralized to sulfite by heme&#8208;globins. The enzymatic reduction of sulfite to sulfide is catalyzed by sulfite reductase, which contains an unusual metal cofactor, siroheme&#8208;[4Fe4S]&#8208;cluster. Overall, the interaction of sulfite with various metalloproteins in&#8197;vivo is a close relation with human health. Therefore, this review describes the metabolic conversion of (bi)sulfite to sulfate, sulfite radical or sulfide via oxidation or reduction pathways by various metalloproteins (specially SOs, peroxidases, heme&#8208;globins, and sulfite reductases), and the potential applications of sulfite in biosensors/biofuel cells, anti&#8208;browning, and advance oxidation process.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Axially Chiral C&#8211;N Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecules with restricted rotation around a single bond or atropisomers are found in a wide number of natural products and bioactive molecules as well as in chiral ligands for asymmetric catalysis and smart materials. Although&#160; most &#160;of these compounds are biaryls and heterobiaryls displaying a C&#8211;C stereogenic axis, there is a growing interest in less common and more challenging axially chiral C&#8211;N atropisomers. This review offers an overview of the&#160; various &#160; methodologies available for their asymmetric synthesis. A brief introduction is initially given to contextualize these axially chiral skeletons, including a historical background and examples of natural products containing axially chiral C&#8211;N axes. The preparation of different families of C&#8211;N based atropisomers is then presented from anilides to chiral five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered ring heterocycles. Special emphasis&#160; has been &#160;given to modern catalytic asymmetric&#160; strategies &#160;over the past decade for the synthesis of these chiral scaffolds. Applications of these methods to the preparation of natural products and biologically active molecules will be highlighted along the text</dc:description>

         <title>Direct gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenylation of X&#8211;H Bonds with Trifluoromethyl Ketone N&#8208;Triftosylhydrazones for Synthesis of Tetrasubstituted Heteroatomic gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes</title>

         <dc:description>The direct gem &#8208;difluoroalkenylation of X&#8211;H bonds represents the most straightforward approach to access heteroatomic gem &#8208;difluoroalkenes that, as the isostere of the carbonyl group, have great potency in drug discovery. However, the construction of tetrasubstituted heteroatomic gem &#8208;difluoroalkenes by this strategy is still an unsolved problem. Here, we report the first direct X&#8211;H bond gem &#8208;difluoroalkenylation of amines and alcohols with trifluoromethyl ketone N &#8208;triftosylhydrazones under silver (for (hetero)aryl hydrazones) or rhodium (for alkyl hydrazones), thereby providing a most powerful method for the synthesis of tetrasubstituted heteroatomic gem &#8208;difluoroalkenes. This method features broad substrate scope, high product yield, excellent functional group tolerance, and operational simplicity (open air condition). Moreover, the site&#8208;specific replacement of the carbonyl group with a gem &#8208;difluorovinyl ether bioisostere in drug Trimebutine and the post&#8208;modification of bioactive molecules demonstrated the potency of this method in the medicinal research. Finally, the reaction mechanism was investigated by combining experiments and DFT calculations, and disclosed that the key step of HF elimination occurred via five&#8208;membered ring transition state, and the difference in the electrophilicity of Ag&#8208; and Rh&#8208;carbenes as well as the multiple intermolecular interactions rendered the effectiveness of Rh catalyst selectively for alkyl hydrazones.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanomaterials with oxidase&#8208; and peroxidase&#8208;like activities have potential in antibacterial therapy. The optimal activity of most nanozymes occurred in acidic pH (3.0&#8211;5.0), while the pH in biological systems is mostly near neutral. Herein, a general system using 9&#8208;fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;modified diphenylalanine (FmocFF) hydrogel for enhancing oxidase&#8208; and peroxidase&#8208;like activities of Pt NPs and other typical enzyme&#8208;like nanomaterials at neutral or even alkaline pH is proposed. In this system, Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel provides an acidic microenvironment for Pt NPs due to hydrogen protons (H  +  ) produced by the dissociation of F at neutral pH. As a result, Pt NPs exhibits 6&#8208;fold enhanced oxidase&#8208;like and 26&#8208;fold peroxidase&#8208;like activity after being encapsulated into Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel at pH 7.0. Based on outstanding enzymatic activities and the antibacterial activity of Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel itself, Pt&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel realizes excellent antibacterial effect. This design provides a universal strategy to break pH limitation of nanozymes, and promotes the biological applications of nanozymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Antibody&#8208;Rhamnose Cluster Conjugates Show Potent Complement&#8208;Dependent Cell Killing by Recruiting Natural Antibodies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient chemoenzymatic synthesis of homogeneous antibody&#8208;rhamnose and antibody&#8208;&#945;Gal cluster conjugates is described. The synthesis was achieved through a modular antibody Fc&#8208;glycan remodeling that includes site&#8208;specific chemoenzymatic Fc&#8208;glycan functionalization and subsequent click conjugation of synthetic rhamnose&#8208; and &#945;Gal trisaccharide clusters. A comparative cell&#8208;based assay indicated that the antibody&#8208;rhamnose cluster conjugates showed potent complement&#8208;dependent targeted cancer cell killing by recruiting natural anti&#8208;rhamnose antibodies.







Abstract
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are one of the most rapidly growing drug classes used for the treatment of cancer, infectious and autoimmune diseases. Complement&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) is one of the effector functions for antibodies to deplete target cells. We report here an efficient chemoenzymatic synthesis of structurally well&#8208;defined conjugates of a monoclonal antibody with a rhamnose&#8208; and an &#945;Gal trisaccharide&#8208;cluster to recruit natural anti&#8208;rhamnose and anti&#8208;&#945;Gal antibodies, respectively, to enhance the CDC&#8208;dependent targeted cell killing. The synthesis was achieved by using a modular antibody Fc&#8208;glycan remodeling method that includes site&#8208;specific chemoenzymatic Fc&#8208;glycan functionalization and subsequent click conjugation of synthetic rhamnose&#8208; and &#945;Gal trisaccharide&#8208;cluster to provide the respective homogeneous antibody conjugates. Cell&#8208;based assays indicated that the antibody&#8208;rhamnose cluster conjugates could mediate potent CDC activity for targeted cancer cell killing and showed much more potent efficacy than the antibody&#8208;&#945;Gal trisaccharide cluster conjugates for CDC effects.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Eucophylline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two strategies based respectively on the free&#8208;radical carbo&#8208; and sulfonyl&#8208;cyanation of cyclopropenes and cyclobutenes were developed to achieve the total enantioselective synthesis of (+)&#8208;eucophylline, a monoterpene alkaloid isolated from Leuconotis eugenifolius.







Abstract
The total enantioselective synthesis of (+)&#8208;eucophylline 1 was achieved using as a key&#8208;structural motif a chiral piperidinone bearing the natural product all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter. The elaboration of the latter is based on two strategies relying on the free&#8208;radical carbo&#8208;cyanation and sulfonyl&#8208;cyanation respectively of enantiopure substituted cyclopropenes and cyclobutenes. Co&#8208; or Ni&#8208;boride reduction of the nitrile functional group along with the cyclopropane and cyclobutane ring&#8208;opening then led to the formation of the chiral piperidinone ring. Further elaboration of the latter into the key 1&#8208;azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane motif followed by its coupling with a 2&#8208;cyanoaniline allowed the formation of the tetrahydrobenzo[b][1,8]&#8208;naphthyridine skeleton of 1, which was finally accessible in 17 steps and 5.9&#8201;% overall yield from 1,1&#8208;dibromobutene.

         <title>Cu(I)/Chiral Bisoxazoline&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Doyle&#8208;Kirmse Reaction of Allenyl Sulfides with &#945;&#8208;Diazoesters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Doyle&#8208;Kirmse reaction of allenyl sulfides and  a  &#8208;diazoesters, which provides an efficient synthetic route to enantio&#8208;enriched chiral tertiary homopropargylic sulfides. This reaction features high enantioselectivities (up to 96%  ee  ) and good functional group tolerance. The alkyl substituted  a  &#8208;diazoester was demonstrated as the efficient substrates in the asymmetric Doyle&#8208;Kirmse reaction.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Herein we report a Cu(I)-catalyzed enantioselective Doyle-Kirmse reaction of allenyl sulfides and  a  -diazoesters, which provides an efficient synthetic route to enantio-enriched chiral tertiary homopropargylic sulfides. This reaction features high enantioselectivities (up to 96%  ee  ) and good functional group tolerance. The alkyl substituted  a  -diazoester was demonstrated as the efficient substrates in the asymmetric Doyle-Kirmse reaction. Mechanistic studies, including kinetic experiments, were conducted to gain insights into the details of the reaction pathway. The potential synthetic utility of this protocol has also been demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks as Unique Platforms to Gain Insight of &#963;&#8208;Hole Interactions for the Removal of Organic Dyes from Aquatic Ecosystems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of high crystallinity and rich host&#8208;guest chemistry in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), have situated them in an advantageous position, with respect to traditional porous materials, to gain insight on specific weak noncovalent supramolecular interactions. In particular, sulfur s&#8208;hole interactions are known to play a key role in the biological activity of living beings as well as on relevant molecular recognitions processes. However, so far, they have been barely explored. Here, we describe both how the combination of the intrinsic features of MOFs, especially the possibility of using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography (SCXRD), can be an extremely valuable tool to gain insight on sulfur s&#8208;hole interactions, and how their rational exploitation can be enormously useful in the efficient removal of harmful organic molecules from aquatic ecosystems. Thus, we have used a MOF, prepared from the amino acid L&#8208;methionine and possessing channels decorated with &#8211;CH2CH2SCH3 thioalkyl chains, to remove a family of organic dyes at very low concentrations (10 ppm) from water. This MOF is able to efficiently capture the four dyes in a very fast manner, reaching within five minutes nearly the maximum removal. Remarkably, the crystal structure of the different organic dyes within MOFs channels could be determined by SCXRD. This have enabled us to directly visualize the important role sulfur s&#8208;hole interactions play on the removal of organic dyes from aqueous solutions, representing one of the first studies on the rational exploitation of s&#8208;hole interactions for water remediation.</dc:description>

         <title>Comprehensive Characterization of Shredded Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Recycling Material</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report on an analytical study of dry&#8208;shredded lithium ion battery (LIB) materials with unknown composition. Samples from an industrial recycling process were analyzed concerning the elemental composition and (organic) compound speciation. Deep understanding of the base material for LIB recycling was obtained by identification and analysis of transition metal stoichiometry, current collector metals, base electrolyte and electrolyte additive residues, aging marker molecules and polymer binder fingerprints. For reversed engineering purposes, the main electrode and electrolyte chemistries were traced back to pristine materials. Furthermore, possible lifetime application and accompanied aging was evaluated based on target analysis on characteristic molecules described in literature. With this, the reported analytics provided precious information for value estimation of the undefined spent batteries and enabled tailored recycling process deliberations. The comprehensive feedstock characterization shown in this work paves the way for targeted process control in LIB recycling processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Factors Governing the Catalytic Insertion of CO2 into Arenes &#8211; A DFT Case Study for Pd and Pt Phosphane Sulfonamido Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The potential of Pd/Pt complexes for catalytic carboxylation of arenes with CO  2  is investigated by means of computational chemistry. Recently we reported that the bis[(2&#8208;methoxyphenyl)phosphino]&#8208;benzenesulfonamido palladium complex  1  inserts CO  2  reversibly in its Pd&#8208;C(aryl) bond generating carboxylato complex  2  . In the present work we study how geometric and electronic factors of various ligands and substrates influence the overall activation barrier (energy span, ES) of a potential catalytic cycle for arene carboxylation comprising this elementary step. The tendency of the key intermediates to dimerize and thus deactivating the potential catalysts is examined as well as the role of the base, which inevitably is needed to stabilize the reaction product. We show that Pd and Pt complexes  I(Pd)&#8208;L16&#8208;S1  and  I(Pt)&#8208;L16&#8208;S1  do not dimerize, enable the computation of complete catalytic cycles, and show interestingly low ES values of 26.8 and 24.5 kcal/mol, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;temperature quantum tunneling and hydrogen bonding rearrangements characterize the solid&#8208;solid phase transitions in a phosphonium&#8208;based protic ionic liquid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the complex phase behavior of the glass forming protic ionic liquid octylphosphonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [C 8 H 17 PD 3 ][NTf 2 ] by means of solidstate NMR spectroscopy. Combined line shape and spin relaxation studies of the deuterons in the PD 3 group of the octylphosphonium cation allow to map and correlate the phase behavior for a broad temperature range from 71 K to 343 K. In the solid PIL at 71 K, we observed a static state, characterized by the first deuteron quadrupole coupling constant reported for PD 3 deuterons. A transition enthalpy of about 12 kJ mol &#8208;1 from the static to the mobile state with increasing temperature suggests the breaking of a weak, charge&#8208;enhanced hydrogen bond between cation and anion. The highly mobile phase above 100 K exhibits an almost disappearing activation barrier, strongly indicating quantum tunneling. Thus, we provide first evidence of tunneling driven mobility of the hydrogen bonded P&#8208;D moieties in the glassy state of PILs, already at surprisingly high temperatures up to 200 K. Above 250 K, the mobile phase turns from anisotropic to isotropic motion, and indicates strong internal rotation of the PD 3 group. The analyzed line shapes and spin relaxation times allow us to link the structural and dynamical behavior at molecular level with the phase behavior beyond the DSC traces .</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Hot&#8208;hole injection from plasmonic metal nanoparticles to the valence band of p&#8208;type semiconductors and reduction by hot electrons should be improved for efficient and tuneable reduction to obtain beneficial chemical compounds. We employed the concept of modal strong coupling between plasmons and a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot (FP) nanocavity to enhance the hot&#8208;hole injection efficiency. We fabricated a photocathode composed of gold nanoparticles (Au&#8208;NPs), p&#8208;type nickel oxide (NiO), and a platinum film (Pt film) (ANP). The ANP structure absorbs visible light over a broad wavelength range from 500 nm to 850 nm via hybrid modes based on the modal strong coupling between the plasmons of Au&#8208;NPs and the FP nanocavity of NiO on a Pt film. All wavelength regions of the hybrid modes of the modal coupling system promoted hot&#8208;hole injection from the Au&#8208;NPs to NiO and proton/water reduction by hot electrons. The incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency based on H 2 evolution through water/proton reduction by hot electrons reached 0.2% at 650 nm and 0.04% at 800 nm.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the C/N Ratio of C&#8208;Rich Graphitic Carbon Nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) Materials by the Melamine/Carboxylic Acid Adduct Route</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile synthesis route to graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4)&#8208;type materials CNx having a large range of composition (0.66&lt;x&lt;1.4) is presented. The process is based on the decomposition of melamine/carboxylic acid adducts and yields peculiar 2D nanostructures with presumably C&#8208;rich nanodomains embedded in g&#8208;C3N4 domains. The characteristics of these nanocomposites are investigated by different techniques (X&#8208;ray diffraction, thermal analysis, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and many others).







Abstract
C&#8208;rich graphitic carbonitride materials (CNx) with a large range of compositions have been prepared thanks to the self&#8208;assembly, in different ratios, of melamine (M) and a panel of polycarboxylic acids (A) such as oxalic, tartaric and citric acid. The thermal conversion of the formed adducts (MAy), led to CNx phases, with x ranging from 0.66 to 1.4 (x=1.33 for g&#8208;C3N4 for comparison). The properties of these materials were examined by different techniques (XRD, Raman spectroscopy, TEM, TGA, XPS and DRIFT). It appears that the increase in the C content is associated with the disappearance of the long&#8208;range order of heptazine units and an increase in the sub&#8208;nanometer carbon&#8208;rich cluster size within the graphitic g&#8208;C3N4 structure. This trend is followed by a significant increase in the interlayer spacing and a lower proportion of N=C&#8722;N bonds compared to C=C bonds. The thermal stability under an inert atmosphere of these phases and their UV&#8208;Visible absorbance properties were also investigated.

&lt;/sub&gt; having a large range of composition (0.66&amp;lt;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;1.4) is presented. The process is based on the decomposition of melamine/carboxylic acid adducts and yields peculiar 2D nanostructures with presumably C-rich nanodomains embedded in g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; domains.

         <title>Benchmarking of Density Functionals for the Description of Optical Properties of Newly Synthesized &#960;&#8208;Conjugated TADF Blue Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis and computational guidelines based on benchmarking of DFT functionals for new &#960;&#8208;conjugated TADF emitters are reported. The three target compounds were obtained by multistep synthesis, including metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions and functional&#8208;group transformations. The emitters feature electron donors and acceptors moderately coupled through a spacer. The importance of the treatment of long&#8208;range exchange within the functionals and their ability to balance the &#960;&#8208;delocalization of the separate molecular fragments are explicitly outlined.







Abstract
Computational modeling of the optical characteristics of organic molecules with potential for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) may assist markedly the development of more efficient emitting materials for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. Recent theoretical studies in this area employ mostly methods from density functional theory (DFT). In order to obtain accurate predictions within this approach, the choice of a proper functional is crucial. In the current study, we focus on testing the performance of a set of DFT functionals for estimation of the excitation and emission energy and the excited singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of three newly synthesized compounds with capacity for TADF. The emitters are designed specifically to enable charge transfer by &#960;&#8208;electron conjugation, at the same time possessing high&#8208;energy excited triplet states. The functionals chosen for testing are from various groups ranging from gradient&#8208;corrected through global hybrids to range&#8208;separated ones. The results show that the monitored optical properties are especially sensitive to how the long&#8208;range part of the exchange energy is treated within the functional. The accurate functional should also be able to provide well balanced distribution of the &#960;&#8208;electrons among the molecular fragments. Global hybrids with moderate (less than 0.4) share of exact exchange (B3LYP, PBE0) and the meta&#8208;GGA HSE06 are outlined as the best performing methods for the systems under study. They can predict all important optical parameters correctly, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

         <title>Tribo&#8208;Excited Chemical Reaction Using an EuIII Complex with a Stacked Anthracene Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spin&#8208;selective tribo&#8208;chemical reaction using a dinuclear lanthanide complex is demonstrated for the first time. The dinuclear complex is composed of two EuIII ions, hexafluoroacetylacetonato ligands, and anthracene&#8208;based phosphine oxide bridges. Single&#8208;crystal analysis revealed a face&#8208;to&#8208;face&#8208;type anthracene dimer structure in the dinuclear EuIII complex. Mechanical stimulus on the dinuclear EuIII complex induced selective formation of oxidized anthracene. This first spin&#8208;selective tribo&#8208;chemical reaction using a EuIII complex will offer new possibilities for the development of tribo&#8208;excitation chemistry.

         <title>Investigating a Boronate&#8208;Affinity&#8208;Guided Acylation Reaction for Labelling Native Antibodies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adding function: A boronate&#8208;affinity ligand and an S&#8208;aryl thioester have been developed that are capable of labelling native Abs with a functional molecule. Additionally, a photoactivatable crosslinker allows purification of labelled Abs in a reagentless manner, thereby producing homogeneous Ab&#8208;drug conjugates.







Abstract
The excellent molecular recognition capabilities of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have opened up exciting opportunities for biotherapeutic discovery. Taking advantage of the full potential of this tool necessitates affinity ligands capable of conjugating directly with small molecules to a defined degree of biorthogonality, especially when modifying natural Abs. Herein, a bioorthogonal boronate&#8208;affinity&#8208;based Ab ligand featuring a 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine and an S&#8208;aryl thioester to label full&#8208;length Abs is reported. The photoactivatable linker in the acyl donor facilitated purification of azide&#8208;labelled Ab (N3&#8208;Ab) was quantitatively cleaved upon brief exposure to UV light while retaining the original Ab activity. Click reactions enabled the precise addition of biotin, a fluorophore, and a pharmacological agent to the purified N3&#8208;Abs. The resulting immunoconjugate showed selectivity against targeted cells. Bioorthogonal traceless design and reagentless purification allow this strategy to be a powerful tool to engineer native antibodies amenable to therapeutic intervention.

         <title>Rational Design and Integrative Assembly of Heteromeric Metalla[2]Catenanes Featuring Cp*Ir/Rh Fragments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrative assembly of a series of heteromeric metalla[2]catenanes was realized on account of prior precise design. A new design strategy was proposed. The design strategy essentially follows the principle of shape complementarity. Based on careful rational design of the functional groups, the shape and the size of the building blocks, the integrative assembly of a series of heteromeric [2]catenanes were successfully achieved both by assembly of two pre&#8208;assembled metalla&#8208;rectangles and by one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly.







Abstract
We report a design strategy for integrative assembly of heteromeric [2]catenanes. The design focuses on the shape and functional group match of two different metalla&#8208;rectangles. A series of dipyridyl ligands with different lengths, widths and functional groups were designed and used for assembly experiments. Six heteromeric [2]catenanes were obtained both by direct mixture of two pre&#8208;assembled metalla&#8208;rectangles and one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly. Multiple analytic methods were employed to characterize the catenanes, including single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, NMR spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy and elemental analysis.

         <title>The Decisive Role of Spin States and Spin Coupling in Dictating Selective O2 Adsorption in Chromium(II) Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The importance of spin state and spin coupling in gas binding selectivity in MOFs has been uncovered using periodic DFT calculations. The electron&#8208;transfer mechanism adopted by gaseous O2 leads to its strongly spin&#8208;state&#8208;dependent binding, unlike the case for N2 and H2. O2/N2&#8208;selective adsorption/desorption processes have high commercial value, and this work offers a new strategy for such selective control.







Abstract
The coordinatively unsaturated chromium(II)&#8208;based Cr3[(Cr4Cl)3(BTT)8]2 (Cr&#8722;BTT; BTT3&#8722;=1,3,5&#8208;benzenetristetrazolate) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) has been shown to exhibit exceptional selectivity towards adsorption of O2 over N2/H2. Using periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we attempted to decipher the origin of this puzzling selectivity. By computing and analyzing the magnetic exchange coupling, binding energies, the partial density of states (pDOS), and adsorption isotherms for the pristine and gas&#8208;bound MOFs [(Cr4(X)4Cl)3(BTT)8]3&#8722; (X=O2, N2, and H2), we unequivocally established the role of spin states and spin coupling in controlling the gas selectivity. The computed geometries and gas adsorption isotherms are consistent with the earlier experiments. The binding of O2 to the MOF follows an electron&#8208;transfer mechanism resulting in a CrIII superoxo species (O2.&#8722;) with a very strong antiferromagnetic coupling between the two centers, whereas N2/H2 are found to weakly interact with the metal center and hence only slightly perturb the associated coupling constants. Although the gas&#8208;bound and unbound MOFs have an S=0 ground state (GS), the nature of spin the configurations and the associated magnetic exchanges are dramatically different. The binding energy and the number of oxygen molecules that can favorably bind to the Cr center were found to vary with respect to the spin state, with a significant energy margin (47.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). This study offers a hitherto unknown strategy of using spin state/spin couplings to control gas adsorption selectivity in MOFs.

         <title>Designable Guest&#8208;Molecule Encapsulation in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Proton Conductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How to welcome guests: In this review, we summarize the current strategies for introducing guest molecules into MOFs to improve their proton conductivity, and divide the guest molecules into four types. We also present the challenges and prospects of applying this strategy for these solid proton conducting materials.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), as a porous frame material, exhibit considerable electrical conductivity. In recent decades, research on the proton conductivity of MOFs has made gratifying progress. In this review, the designable guest molecules encapsulated into MOFs are summarized and generalized into four types in terms of promoting proton conductive performance, and then recent progress in the promotion of proton conductivity by MOFs encapsulating guest molecules is discussed. The existing challenges and prospects for the development of this strategy for promoting MOFs&#8217; proton conductivity are also listed.

Visible&#8208;light photoswitching: A photoswitchable ligand and palladium(II) ions form a dynamic mixture of self&#8208;assembled metallosupramolecular structures. Visible&#8208;light photoswitching of the azobenzene&#8208;based ligand reversibly pumps the system away from equilibrium towards the thermodynamically unstable structure.







Abstract
A photoswitchable ligand and palladium(II) ions form a dynamic mixture of self&#8208;assembled metallosupramolecular structures. The photoswitching ligand is an ortho&#8208;fluoroazobenzene with appended pyridyl groups. Combining the E&#8208;isomer with palladium(II) salts affords a double&#8208;walled triangle with composition [Pd3L6]6+ and a distorted tetrahedron [Pd4L8]8+ (1&#8201;:&#8201;2 ratio at 298&#8197;K). Irradiation with 410&#8197;nm light generates a photostationary state with approximately 80&#8201;% of the E&#8208;isomer of the ligand and results in the selective disassembly of the tetrahedron, the more thermodynamically stable structure, and the formation of the triangle, the more kinetically inert product. The triangle is then slowly transformed back into the tetrahedron over 2&#8197;days at 333&#8197;K. The Z&#8208;isomer of the ligand does not form any well&#8208;defined structures and has a thermal half&#8208;life of 25&#8197;days at 298&#8197;K. This approach shows how a thermodynamically preferred self&#8208;assembled structure can be reversibly pumped to a kinetic trap by small perturbations of the isomer distribution using non&#8208;destructive visible light.

         <title>MOF Encapsulated AuPt Bimetallic Nanoparticles for Improved Plasmonic&#8208;induced Photothermal Catalysis of CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 encapsulated AuPt alloy NPs exhibit a significant enhancement in the CO2 hydrogenation under low temperature (150&#8201;&#176;C). The outstanding performance of AuPt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 was attributed to the synergetic effect induced by plasmonic metal Au, active metal Pt, and versatile substrate UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. Importantly, the AuPt alloy structure retains both the optical behavior of plasmonic metal and the reactive behavior of catalytic metal. This construction strategy provides guidance for the preparation of high&#8208;performance plasmonic catalysts.







Abstract
Exploring new catalytic strategies for achieving efficient CO2 hydrogenation under mild conditions is of great significance for environmental remediation. Herein, a composite photocatalyst Zr&#8208;based MOF encapsulated plasmonic AuPt alloy nanoparticles (AuPt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2) was successfully constructed for the efficient photothermal catalysis of CO2 hydrogenation. Under light irradiation at 150&#8201;&#176;C, AuPt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 achieved a CO production rate of 1451&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gmetal&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with 91&#8201;% selectivity, which far exceeded those obtained by Au@Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 with Pt shell on Au (599&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gmetal&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and Au@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 (218&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gmetal&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). The outstanding performances of AuPt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 were attributed to the synergetic effect originating from the plasmonic metal Au, doped active metal Pt, and encapsulation structure of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 shell. This work provides a new way for photothermal catalysis of CO2 and a reference for the design of high&#8208;performance plasmonic catalysts.

Cocrystallization of TEMPO with a series of dithiadiazolyl (DTDA) radicals, p&#8208;XC6F4CNSSN (X=F, Cl, Br, I, CN), led to the isolation of 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 radical&#8208;radical cocrystals [p&#8208;XC6F4CNSSN]2[TEMPO] that exhibit a common S4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O structural motif. Computational studies reflect the robust nature of this interaction and identify a well&#8208;isolated S=
 spin ground state, largely localized on the TEMPO radical.







Abstract
Cocrystallization of the dithiadiazolyl (DTDA) radicals p&#8208;XC6F4CNSSN (X=F, Cl, Br, I, CN) with TEMPO afforded the 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 cocrystals [p&#8208;XC6F4CNSSN]2[TEMPO] (1&#8211;5) whose structures all reflect a common S4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O supramolecular motif. The nature of this interaction was probed by DFT calculations (M06/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVDZ) on 1 which revealed that the enthalpy of formation of the [C6F5CNSSN]2[TEMPO] supramolecular motif from [C6F5CNSSN]2 and TEMPO is substantial (&#8722;54.0&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Electronic structure calculations revealed a TEMPO&#8208;based doublet S=
 configuration as the ground state with limited spin density on the DTDA rings (2.4&#8201;%). The corresponding spin quartet state is +78.9&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 higher in energy. An atoms&#8208;in&#8208;molecules analysis reveals four bond critical points (BCPs) between the TEMPO O and the DTDA S atoms as well as additional BCPs between selected DTDA S atoms and methyl H atoms of the TEMPO molecule. Herein, the structures of 2&#8211;5 are considered within the context of a hierarchical view of competing and complementary intermolecular interactions; in particular, the established supramolecular CN&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S&#8722;S synthon is sacrificed in order to form the new S4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interaction.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Chemical Protein Synthesis Utilizing Fmoc&#8208;Masked Selenazolidine to Address the Redox Functionality of Human Selenoprotein F**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The one&#8208;pot chemical synthesis of the thioredoxin&#8208;like domain of the ER human selenoprotein F using novel Fmoc&#8208;protected selenazolidine is reported. This allowed us to perform different in&#8197;vitro biological characterizations, including redox potential determination, insulin turbidimetric assay, and the effect on the oxidative folding of Cys&#8208;rich protein models. Our results support that SELENOF acts as a reductase for non&#8208;native disulfide bonds in the ER.







Abstract
Human SELENOF is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) selenoprotein that contains the redox active motif CXU (C is cysteine and U is selenocysteine), resembling the redox motif of thiol&#8208;disulfide oxidoreductases (CXXC). Like other selenoproteins, the challenge in accessing SELENOF has somewhat limited its full biological characterization thus far. Here we present the one&#8208;pot chemical synthesis of the thioredoxin&#8208;like domain of SELENOF, highlighted by the use of Fmoc&#8208;protected selenazolidine, native chemical ligations and deselenization reactions. The redox potential of the CXU motif, together with insulin turbidimetric assay suggested that SELENOF may catalyze the reduction of disulfides in misfolded proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SELENOF is not a protein disulfide isomerase (PDI)&#8208;like enzyme, as it did not enhance the folding of the two protein models; bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and hirudin. These studies suggest that SELENOF may be responsible for reducing the non&#8208;native disulfide bonds of misfolded glycoproteins as part of the quality control system in the ER.

         <title>A Universal DNA Aptamer that Recognizes Spike Proteins of Diverse SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Variants of Concern</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This is a unique one: A unique DNA aptamer has been discovered that has the ability to recognize the spike proteins of the wildtype SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and its seven current variants of concern (VoCs), including B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, B.1.429, B.1.617.1 B.1.617.2 and B.1.1.529 and is predicted to recognize the spike proteins of future VoCs.







Abstract
We report on a unique DNA aptamer, denoted MSA52, that displays universally high affinity for the spike proteins of wildtype SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 as well as the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon, Kappa, Delta and Omicron variants. Using an aptamer pool produced from round 13 of selection against the S1 domain of the wildtype spike protein, we carried out one&#8208;round SELEX experiments using five different trimeric spike proteins from variants, followed by high&#8208;throughput sequencing and sequence alignment analysis of aptamers that formed complexes with all proteins. A previously unidentified aptamer, MSA52, showed Kd values ranging from 2 to 10&#8197;nM for all variant spike proteins, and also bound similarly to variants not present in the reselection experiments. This aptamer also recognized pseudotyped lentiviruses (PL) expressing eight different spike proteins of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 with Kd values between 20 and 50&#8197;pM, and was integrated into a simple colorimetric assay for detection of multiple PL variants. This discovery provides evidence that aptamers can be generated with high affinity to multiple variants of a single protein, including emerging variants, making it well&#8208;suited for molecular recognition of rapidly evolving targets such as those found in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

         <title>Strengthening of the C&#8722;F Bond in Fumaryl Fluoride with Superacids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C&#8722;F bond of fumaryl fluoride is strengthened by protonation of the oxygen atom in a sea of superacid. The chain represents the reinforced connection between the carbon atom and the fluorine atom. The C&#8722;F bond even reveals a slight double&#8208;bond character and a formal positive charge on the fluorine atom. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;J. Kornath, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104422).

         <title>Capture of Gaseous Iodine in Isoreticular Zirconium&#8208;Based UiO&#8208;n Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Influence of Amino Functionalization, DFT Calculations, Raman and EPR Spectroscopic Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gaseous iodine has been captured by using a series of zirconium&#8208;based UiO&#8208;n metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) sorbents. This study highlights the significant role of amino groups attached to the organic linker, which enhance the iodine uptake capacity, as well as its conversion into anionic iodide I3&#8722; species, trapped within UiO&#8208;n cavities. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Loiseau et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104437). Margot Friscourt and Orfeas Plastiras are thanked for the cover artwork.

         <title>Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Aldehydes with Allylboronates Enables Facile Access to Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy for the preparation of ketones from aldehydes and allylic boronic esters is presented. This reaction involves the allylation of aldehydes with allylic boronic esters and the Rh&#8208;catalyzed chain&#8208;walking of homoallylic alcohols. This approach features mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional groups. Mechanistic studies also supported that a tandem allylation and chain&#8208;walking process were involved.







Abstract
We present herein a novel strategy for the preparation of ketones from aldehydes and allylic boronic esters. This reaction involves the allylation of aldehydes with allylic boronic esters and the Rh&#8208;catalyzed chain&#8208;walking of homoallylic alcohols. The key to this successful development is the protodeboronation of alkenyl borylether intermediate via a tetravalent borate anion species in the presence of KHF2 and MeOH. This approach features mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies also supported that the tandem allylation and chain&#8208;walking process were involved.

         <title>H/F Substitution Induced Large Increase of Tc in a 3D Hybrid Rare&#8208;Earth Double Perovskite Multifunctional Compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional perovskites: Two 3D hybrid rare&#8208;earth double perovskite compounds show multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive properties that ferroelasticity, dielectric switch, and photoluminescence. The photoluminescence response shows that the emission intensity has no quench as the temperature increased. In particular, using the H/F substitution strategy generating an Rb&#8208;F coordinate bond enhanced the interactions between the cations and the anions to realize high Tc ferroelasticity.







Abstract
Increasing attention has been devoted to studying perovskite&#8208;type multifunctional stimuli&#8208;responsive materials with multiple channel physical characteristics. However, it remains challenging to simultaneously achieve multifunction and regulate structural phase transition temperature in hybrid perovskites. Here, we report two three&#8208;dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid rare&#8208;earth double perovskite compounds, (HQ)2RbEu(NO3)6 (1, HQ=quinuclidium) and (4FHQ)2RbEu(NO3)6 (2, 4FHQ=4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;quinuclidium), which exhibit ferroelasticity, dielectric switch, and excellent photoluminescence response. The phase transition temperature of 2 increases 169&#8197;K compared with 1 through H/F substitution. This result is attributed to the H/F substitution inducing the generation of the Rb&#8208;F coordination bond between cations and anions. Meanwhile, the photoluminescence emission intensity of 2 shows no quench with the increase of temperature, in particular, the emission spectrum achieves fine regulation at high temperatures. This work provides a new solution for the realization of multi&#8208;functions and regulations of the properties based on hybrid perovskite materials with high critical temperatures.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Mimetic Molecular Selective Catalysis via Single Zr Atom Catalysis in Chelated Cage Embedded in a Flexible Piezoelectrical Matrix</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect of supramolecular recognition and piezoelectrical field in soft assemblies in achieving molecularly selective high performance catalysis on single atom catalyst is first elucidated. Encapsulated and chelated guest such as Rhodamine B (RhB) is effectively converted with ratios higher than 90&#8201;% after 100&#8197;min. In comparison, molecules inefficient in either cage encapsulation or chelating with the Zr center can not be converted.







Abstract
The molecularly selective catalysis in enzyme is central to life. However, their functioning mechanism remains elusive. We propose here that the synergistic effects from (i) effective orbital hybridizing and energy gap decreasing via chelating on single Zr atom as the catalytic center, (ii) selective supramolecular encapsulation in the cage, and (iii) piezoelectrical field motivation are able to achieve the enzyme&#8208;mimetic molecular selective high performance catalysis. Metal&#8211;organic polyhedra (MOPs) are added into a piezoelectrical polymer matrix to achieve the composite structure where ultrasonic treatment motivates redox reactions in the MOP&#8208;guest complex. Encapsulated and chelated guest such as Rhodamine B (RhB) is effectively converted with ratios higher than 90&#8201;% after 100&#8197;min. In comparison, molecules inefficient in either cage encapsulation or chelating with the Zr center can not be converted. This study first proposes a synergistic plot for enzyme&#8208;mimetic catalyst realization and is expected to inspire new mentality in efficient catalyst designing.

         <title>Proton or Carbene Transfer? On the Dark and Light Reaction of Diazoalkanes with Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
O&#8208;H Functionalization: In this combined experimental and computational study, the reaction of diaryl diazoalkanes with alcohols is reported. In the ground state, a direct proton transfer governs reactivity with acidic HFIP. On the contrary, photoexcitation leads to formation of a triplet carbene intermediate that undergoes an alcohol&#8208;assisted intersystem crossing to a solvent&#8208;stabilized carbene that results in high&#8208;yield photochemical O&#8722;H functionalization reactions.







Abstract
The formal alkylation reaction of OH groups with diazoalkanes under catalyst&#8208;free reaction conditions finds broad application in organic synthesis. However, even today, this reaction is mainly limited to the use of diazomethane as reaction partner. In this combined experimental and theoretical study, we aim at a fundamental understanding of the reaction of diazoalkanes with alcohols to make this transformation amenable to a generalized approach towards formal alkylation reactions of alcohols with diazoalkanes. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest a direct proton transfer only in exceptional cases. In a more general setting, such O&#8722;H functionalization proceed both under dark and photochemical conditions via a key hydrogen&#8208;bonded singlet carbene intermediate that undergoes a protonation&#8211;addition mechanism. We conclude with applications of this approach in O&#8722;H functionalization reactions of alcohols, including simple fluorinated, halogenated and aliphatic alcohols and showcase functional&#8208;group tolerance of this method in the reaction of biologically active and pharmaceutically relevant alcohols.

         <title>Highly Selective Lysine Acylation in Proteins Using a Lys&#8208;His Tag Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A short, designed Lys&#8208;His tag can be inserted into proteins where it autocatalyzes the highly selective acylation of the Lys side&#8208;chain amine with phenyl esters. The reaction conditions of this site&#8208;selective, chemical protein modification method are mild, and no oxidative reagents, reductants nor enzymes are required.







Abstract
Chemical modification of proteins has numerous applications, but it has been challenging to achieve the required high degree of selectivity on lysine amino groups. Recently, we described the highly selective acylation of proteins with an N&#8208;terminal Gly&#8208;His6 segment. This tag promoted acylation of the N&#8208;terminal N&#945;&#8208;amine resulting in stable conjugates. Herein, we report the peptide sequences Hisn&#8208;Lys&#8208;Hism, which we term Lys&#8208;His tags. In combination with simple acylating agents, they facilitate the acylation of the designated Lys N&#1013;&#8208;amine under mild conditions and with high selectivity over native Lys residues. We show that the Lys&#8208;His tags, which are 7 to 10 amino acids in length and still act as conventional His tags, can be inserted in proteins at the C&#8208;terminus or in loops, thus providing high flexibility regarding the site of modification. Finally, the selective and efficient acylation of the therapeutic antibody Rituximab, pure or mixed with other proteins, demonstrates the scope of the Lys&#8208;His tag acylation method.

         <title>Elucidating the Germanium Distribution in ITQ&#8208;13 Zeolites by Density Functional Theory**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preferred Ge distributions in ITQ&#8208;13 silicogermanates with different Si/Ge ratios were investigated with electronic structure calculations, with the primary aim of predicting the most stable local structures across the range of Ge contents. Additional calculations were used to study the variation of the dynamic behaviour of the incorporated fluoride anions as a function of the local environment and the defluorination behaviour of different fluoride&#8208;containing cages.







Abstract
ITQ&#8208;13 is a medium&#8208;pore zeolite that can be prepared in all&#8208;silica form and as silicogermanate with Si/Ge ratios as low as 3. Usually synthesised in the presence of fluoride, ITQ&#8208;13 is among the very few systems containing fluoride anions in two distinct cage types, cube&#8208;like d4r units and [4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;56] cages. Here, dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to investigate the energetically most favourable Ge distributions for Si/Ge ratios between 55 and 6. The calculations show Ge atoms are incorporated at both the corners of d4r cages and at the basal plane of the [4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;56] cages, in accordance with 19F&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. Two Ge atoms at adjacent corners of [4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;56] cages are stable at the highest Ge content considered (Si/Ge=6). Such a local environment has not yet been considered in the experimental literature. A calculation of the corresponding 19F&#8197;NMR resonance points to overlap with other resonances, which might preclude its clear identification. Additional calculations investigate the variation of the dynamic behaviour of the fluoride anions as a function of the local environment as well as the selective defluorination of the [4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;56] cages.

         <title>Synthesis of Natural Products by C&#8722;H Functionalization of Heterocycless</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of the recent strategies towards the total synthesis of heterocyclic natural products enabled by C&#8722;H functionalization is presented. The review is focused on transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed approaches, such as palladium catalysis, gold catalysis, iridium and ruthenium catalysis, and also presents transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free radical strategies as well as electrophilic&#8208;type metal&#8208;free C&#8722;H functionalization reactions and direct deprotonation approaches driven by the properties of heterocycles. The implementation of C&#8722;H functionalization of heterocycles enables novel tactics in the construction of core architectures, while changing the logic design of retrosynthetic strategies and permitting access to natural product scaffolds with novel and enhanced biological activities.







Abstract
Total synthesis is considered by many as the finest combination of art and science. During the last decades, several concepts were proposed for achieving the perfect vision of total synthesis, such as atom economy, step economy, or redox economy. In this context, C&#8722;H functionalization represents the most powerful platform that has emerged in the last years, empowering rapid synthesis of complex natural products and enabling diversification of bioactive scaffolds based on natural product architectures. In this review, we present an overview of the recent strategies towards the total synthesis of heterocyclic natural products enabled by C&#8722;H functionalization. Heterocycles represent the most common motifs in drug discovery and marketed drugs. The implementation of C&#8722;H functionalization of heterocycles enables novel tactics in the construction of core architectures, but also changes the logic design of retrosynthetic strategies and permits access to natural product scaffolds with novel and enhanced biological activities.
