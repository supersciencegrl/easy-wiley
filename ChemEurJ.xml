         <title>Boric Acid Promoted Base&#8208;Free Chan&#8208;Lam Amination Reaction: A Computationally Inspired Mechanistic Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In silico studies are carried out to underpin the mechanistic features in B(OH)3 promoted CL amination under base&#8208;free condition. Mechanistic effect on organoborane:amine stoichiometry inversion exemplified with transmetalation as rate&#8208;determining.








ABSTRACT
CuII&#8208;catalyzed oxidative coupling reactions based on Chan&#8208;Lam (CL) protocol have established themselves as one of most reliable and practical synthetic tools for the efficient formation of carbon&#8208;nitrogen/heteroatom bonds. Since decades this methodology has witnessed considerable development in its application scope, industrial uptake and fundamental mechanistic knowledge. Despite its successful application and popularity, the underlying mechanistic understanding remains underdeveloped and unexplored. Current theoretical investigation underpins the mechanism of CL&#8208;based amination reaction under base&#8208;free conditions employing the transmetalation by&#8208;product B(OH)3 as promoter. The rate&#8208;determining transmetalation involves an energy span of 26.4&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1 with subsequent overall disproportionation and reductive elimination barrier of 25.4&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1, accompanying stable intermediates in comparison to the base&#8208;mediated CL amination. The aryl migration involves a unique six&#8208;membered transition state unlike similar transition&#8208;metal catalyzed transmetalation event. The CuI&#8594;CuII oxidative regeneration is facile in the presence of B(OH)3 coordinated intermediates. The calculated results are in line with experimental kinetic studies and for the first time elucidates the mechanistic effect of inverting the organoboron: amine stoichiometry. Furthermore, Hammett studies involving substituted aryl boronic acid substrates reveals electron&#8208;rich substitution to entail lower transmetalation barrier. Overall, the boric acid stabilized copper intermediates are thermodynamically stable, allowing the amination to occur at improved time frame.

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of the First Generation of Glycosylated Nucleoside Analogues as Potential Inhibitors of the Base J Metabolism in Kinetoplastid Parasites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel analogues of the kinetoplastid&#8208;specific DNA base J unlock a new way to target parasite epigenetic regulation. Some compounds selectively inhibit Leishmania and Trypanosoma species without harming human cells, revealing a promising route toward innovative antiparasitic therapies.








ABSTRACT
Leishmaniasis and trypanosomiasis are severe parasitic infections with significant impacts on veterinary and public health, particularly affecting the poorest populations. The therapeutic arsenal against these neglected tropical diseases is limited, and the emergence of resistance to available medicines complicates treatment. These kinetoplastid parasites share a unique DNA modification, that is &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucosyl&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxymethyluracil (base J), which appears to play an essential role in parasite development and survival through an original epigenetic mechanism, allowing adaptation to environmental changes. To date, the regulatory pathway of this unique nucleobase has not been explored as a potential therapeutic target. In this work, we report the synthesis of several families of base J analogues and assess their potential against different kinetoplastid species. Some compounds have shown antiparasitic activity and no toxicity toward human primary fibroblasts, revealing promising new strategies for antiparasitic therapy.

         <title>Alkene Functionalizations via the Alkenyl Catellani Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the functionalization of nonaromatic systems via Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis (namely, the alkenyl Catellani reaction). The nonaromatic substrates include uracil, 2&#8208;quinolone, 2&#8208;pyridone, alkenes, coumarin, chromone, glycal, and 1,2&#8208;azaborine, all of which generate a broad range of functional alkenes. In addition, this review outlines developments in asymmetric alkenyl Catellani reactions and highlights their use in the total synthesis of structurally complex molecules.








ABSTRACT
Palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) cooperative catalysis is widely regarded as an effective strategy for constructing polysubstituted arenes, providing a rapid and efficient route that is often difficult to accomplish using traditional cross&#8208;coupling methods. This review focuses on applying Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis to the functionalization of nonaromatic systems, referred to as the alkenyl Catellani reaction. The nonaromatic substrates discussed include uracil, 2&#8208;quinolone, 2&#8208;pyridone, alkene, coumarin, chromone, glycal, and 1,2&#8208;azaborine, all of which generate a broad range of functional alkenes. In addition, this review outlines developments in asymmetric alkenyl Catellani reactions and highlights their use in the total synthesis of structurally complex molecules.

         <title>Hydrogels Formed by the Self&#8208;Assembly of Collagen&#8208;Mimetic Peptides With a Constrained Backbone Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinked collagen&#8208;mimetic peptides (kinkCMPs), whose backbone is constrained by a disulfide bond, are designed to induce hydrogel formation. The kinked backbone promotes supramolecular assembly into tunable hydrogels with thermal stability depending on length. The resulting gels are also applicable as cell culture scaffolds, providing a new strategy for peptide&#8208;based biomaterials.








ABSTRACT
Self&#8208;assembling peptides have attracted increasing attention as building blocks for developing functional materials. Among them, collagen&#8208;mimetic peptides (CMPs) represent a class of self&#8208;assembling systems. However, although short&#8208;chain CMPs spontaneously fold into thermodynamically stable triple&#8208;helical trimers, they fail to further undergo supramolecular assembly to form hydrogels. We report a new strategy for supramolecular hydrogel formation based on CMPs. The designed peptide, termed kinkCMP, features a kinked backbone introduced at the center of the sequence via adjacent disulfide bonds. The kinkCMP forms a gel, and its gel denaturation temperature can be tuned by varying the peptide chain length. Moreover, the hydrogel can be used as a cell culture scaffold. These results provide a versatile approach for constructing supramolecular hydrogels based on CMPs, expanding the design strategies for peptide&#8208;based functional materials.

2,3&#8208;Dihydrobenzopyrans were synthesized highly diastereoselectively from phenols and 2&#8208;cinnamoylpyridine 1&#8208;oxides via Sc(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed tandem Michael addition and hemiketalization process under mild conditions. The diastereoselectivity is controlled thermodynamically, but is impacted by steric and electronic effects. The current study provides a new synthetic toolbox for benzopyran derivatives.








ABSTRACT
Scandium triflate&#8208;catalyzed tandem reaction of electron&#8208;rich phenols and 2&#8208;cinnamoylpyridine 1&#8208;oxides is realized. This protocol enables the highly diastereoselective construction of 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzopyrans (chromanes) via a domino Michael addition (Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation) and hemiketalization process under mild conditions. Using 2&#8208;cinnamoylpyridine 1&#8208;oxides as Michael acceptors, electron&#8208;rich phenols can be extended to methylphenols. The diastereoselectivity is mainly decided by the stability of diastereomeric products, but is impacted by steric and electronic effects. The current study expands the synthetic toolbox for benzopyran derivatives.

         <title>Metalloporphyrin Monolayers as Tunable Platforms for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystalline monolayers of Fe and Cu porphyrins on graphite enable nanometer&#8208;precision mapping of active sites for CO2 electroreduction. High&#8208;resolution STM reveals &#8764;1.5 nm periodicity and quantitative active site distribution. Faradaic efficiencies scale with surface composition, with Fe outperforming Cu, establishing direct structure&#8211;activity correlations at the molecular level.








ABSTRACT
While molecular electrocatalysis for CO2 reduction has advanced significantly, a key challenge persists in accurately defining the active site distribution, surface density, and structural organization of heterogenized catalysts at electrode interfaces. In this study, we address this gap by employing self&#8208;assembled monolayers of physisorbed metal porphyrins (Fe and Cu) on graphite electrodes as structurally well&#8208;defined model systems for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). High&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) revealed crystalline monolayers with uniform active site distribution, offering periodicities of &#8764;1.5 nm. These monolayers exhibit moderate Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) for CO production, with Fe porphyrin outperforming its Cu analogue. Isotopic labeling experiments were employed to confirm that the product CO originates from added CO2. Bicomponent monolayers comprising Fe porphyrin and catalytically inactive free&#8208;base porphyrin were fabricated to investigate composition&#8211;activity relationships. STM imaging enabled direct, quantitative assessment of surface composition, and subsequent CO2RR measurements revealed a systematic decrease in FE with increasing coverage of the catalytically inactive component. These findings demonstrate the utility of molecularly ordered porphyrin monolayers as a powerful platform for probing structure&#8211;activity relationships in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction with exceptional spatial and compositional precision.

         <title>Synthesis of Peptides, Peptide Nucleic Acid Components, and other Biogenic Compounds from a Three&#8208;Component Prebiotic Mixture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;energy proton irradiation of a formamide&#8211;diaminomaleonitrile&#8211;glycine system in the presence of meteorites produces a broad spectrum of biogenic compounds, including nucleobases, nucleosides, peptides, and nucleobase&#8211;peptide conjugates, highlighting a chemically plausible prebiotic network.








ABSTRACT
We have explored the reactions of a three&#8208;components mixture made of formamide, diaminomaleonitrile, and glycine, with meteorites as catalysts and high&#8208;energy proton beam irradiation as the energy source, mimicking the solar wind. The resulting mixture contained a wide array of biogenic compounds, including the complete set of RNA nucleobases and nucleosides, thymine and its analogs, pterins, triazines, carboxylic acids, diketopiperazines, hydantoins, N&#8208;carboxyamino acid anhydrides, amino acids, peptides, and nucleobase&#8211;amino acid/peptide conjugates. It also embodies the possibility of synthesis stability of RNA&#8208;peptide chimeras onto which evolution to the extant molecular genetic system could start. The prebiotic worth of the system consists of the fact that formamide derives from HCN hydrolysis; glycine is a condensation product of formamide and HCN; diaminomaleonitrile is obtained from HCN. The fact that the starting mixture is three&#8208;component does not decrease the prebiotic value; it is a subset of a largely possible general universal condition: all the starting components are only the second step of facile condensation reactions. This model could be the starting point for the chemical evolution towards biological complexity.

         <title>Fluorescence Properties and Mg2+ Selectivity of Aryl&#8208;Alkynyl Derivatives of the o&#8208;Aminophenoltriacetate (APTRA) Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is a challenge to improve the selectivity of high&#8208;denticity ligands for Mg2+ over Ca2+. We show that in aryl&#8208;alkynyl derivatives of APTRA, electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents lower the binding affinity for Ca2+ more than Mg2+, making the ligand more selective for Mg2+. The effect is larger when the APTRA nitrogen is para to alkyne, but the associated charge&#8208;transfer fluorescence is weak in water.








ABSTRACT
Ortho&#8208;aminophenol&#8208;N,N,O&#8208;triacetate (APTRA) has been widely adopted for binding and sensing Mg2+, although it binds Ca2+ more strongly. This contribution investigates APTRA derivatives that incorporate an aryl&#8208;alkynyl fluorophore, addressing how the binding affinities for Mg2+ and Ca2+ are modulated by a substituent R in the aryl ring of the fluorophore. Six such derivatives have been synthesized via their tris&#8208;ethyl esters. They feature X &#9552; CN, CF3, or OMe, as a mesomerically electron&#8208;withdrawing, inductively electron&#8208;withdrawing, or electron&#8208;donating substituent, respectively, with the alkyne either para or meta to the APTRA nitrogen. Study of the absorption and fluorescence properties of the esters reveals the importance of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) states for X &#9552; CN and CF3, but not OMe. The corresponding carboxylate ligands are less emissive in water, and the fluorescence is not strongly modulated by metal ions. However, the absorption spectra change markedly, allowing dissociation constants Kd to be evaluated. The key conclusions are that (i) electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents attenuate the affinity for Ca2+ more than Mg2+, leading to a net improvement in selectivity for Mg2+, and (ii) the effect is larger when the APTRA nitrogen (as opposed to phenolic oxygen) is para to&#8212;and hence directly conjugated with&#8212;the alkyne.

ABSTRACT
Inducible protein expression is a cornerstone of many aspects of industrial and molecular biotechnological processes. However, limited availability of inducible transcription factors can reduce our ability to control expression at a population level. The design and synthesis of a powerful inducer containing a fucose is demonstrated to induce protein expression through the lac operon only in cells with the ability to selectively de&#8208;fucosylate them. Batch and automated continuous&#8208;flow processes are reported for the syntheses of both 2&#8242;&#8208;fucosyl isopropyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;thiogalactopyranose (2&#8242;F&#8208;IPTG) and isobutyl&#8208;C&#8208;galactoside (2&#8242;F&#8208;IBCG) mimics. Fucosylation of the inducer allowed for fucosidase&#8208;dependent expression of a reporter protein, providing an additional layer of control over inducible gene expression.

The synthesis of 4,13&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;carbo[6]helicene derivatives substituted at positions 2,15 by either 2&#8208;azulene (H&#8208;2&#8208;azu) or 6&#8208;azulene (H&#8208;6&#8208;azu) units is presented. The photophysical and chiroptical properties of these new helicene&#8208;azulene derivatives have been examined in details. Both helical constitutional isomers H&#8208;2&#8208;azu and H&#8208;6&#8208;azu exhibit strong electronic circular dichroic responses in the azulene absorption region and reversible chiroptical switching upon protonation/deprotonation. Furthermore, although very weak, emission was also observed and was analyzed as originating from the S1 excited state, i.e., obeying the Kasha rule, which is not common in azulene derivatives. Theoretical calculations helped confirm these observations. Finally, these systems revealed efficient chemical acid&#8208;base triggered chiroptical switching activity, showing notably a strong red shift upon protonation.

         <title>Programmable Intermolecular Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexes for Photothermal Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge&#8208;transfer complex nanoparticles, termed PER&#8208;TCQ, was constructed through charge&#8208;transfer interaction between the electron donor (PER) and the electron acceptor (TCQ), which exhibits efficient NIR absorption. Consequently, PER&#8208;TCQ achieves effective tumor ablation via photothermal therapy.








ABSTRACT
Photothermal therapy (PTT) is a promising tumor treatment strategy. However, developing organic photothermal agents (PTAs) with both high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) and simple synthesis remains a major challenge. Herein, we developed the charge&#8208;transfer complex nanoparticles (termed PER&#8208;TCQ), via supramolecular assembly of perylene (PER) as the electron donor and tetrachloro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TCQ) as the electron acceptor. The strong charge&#8208;transfer interaction between PER and TCQ confers PER&#8208;TCQ nanoparticles with pronounced near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption. Upon 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, PER&#8208;TCQ achieved a high PCE of 66.1%. Its effective antitumor efficacy was consistently validated by in vitro and in vivo experiments, demonstrating the great promise of such programmable complexes as high&#8208;performance organic PTAs.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Dependent Multilayered Host&#8211;Guest Assemblies Formed by a Xanthene&#8208;Based Dinuclear Nickel(II) Macrocycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A xanthene&#8208;based bis(saloph) dinickel(II) macrocyclic host, L2bNi2, forms cation&#8208;dependent assemblies with alkali metal ions. The complexation with Na+ afforded 2:1 and 1:1 (host/guest) complexes, whereas larger ions (K+, Rb+, Cs+) yielded stable dimeric complexes, which were further converted to higher&#8208;order aggregates (2:2, 2:3, and 3:2 complexes). X&#8208;ray analyses revealed hexagonaol planar coordination for Na+ and orthogonal dimeric stacking for larger cations. DFT calculations showed that reduced host&#8211;host repulsion stabilizes 2:1 complexes for larger ions.








ABSTRACT
A planar bis(saloph) nickel(II) macrocyclic host, L2bNi2, incorporating xanthene motifs and hexyl side chains, was synthesized to provide structural rigidity and solubility. Its ion recognition behavior toward alkali metal ions was investigated by 1H NMR titration, mass spectrometry, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. With Na+, a 2:1 (host/guest) sandwich&#8208;type complex was formed at 0.5 equiv, which shifted to a monomeric 1:1 complex upon further Na+ addition. In contrast, larger alkali metal ions such as K+, Rb+, and Cs+ formed stable 2:1 (host/guest) dimeric complexes, whose sandwich structures remained intact even in the presence of excess cation, resulting in the formation of 2:2, 2:3, and 3:2 higher&#8208;order assemblies, unlike those of previously reported related macrocycles. X&#8208;ray analyses revealed a rare hexagonal planar coordination for Na+ and orthogonally stacked dimeric structures for the larger cations. Theoretical calculations support the experimental trends, showing that larger alkali metal ions favor 2:1 complexation due to reduced repulsive interactions between the metallomacrocycles. These findings demonstrate that the aggregation behavior of the metallomacrocycle is sensitively tuned by the size and coordination preferences of guest cations, highlighting the utility of preorganized, metal&#8208;based macrocycles in constructing dynamic, multivalent supramolecular architectures.

         <title>Construction of Bi&#8208;BTC/BiYO3 Heterojunction@Cellulose Acetate Composite Material and Its Efficient Photocatalytic Degradation of Tetracycline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
The widespread use of tetracycline (TC) has resulted in severe water pollution, highlighting the urgent need for efficient degradation technologies. In this study, a Bi&#8208;BTC/BiYO3/CA photocatalyst was synthesized using cellulose acetate (CA) as a carrier via a solvothermal process combined with nonsolvent&#8208;induced phase separation, and its photocatalytic performance in TC degradation was systematically evaluated. Under optimal conditions, a degradation efficiency of 95.06% was achieved. Both experimental and theoretical analyses revealed that the formation of the Bi&#8208;BTC/BiYO3 heterojunction enhances the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and improves visible&#8208;light absorption, whereas the incorporation of CA significantly boosts the material's recyclability. Various characterization methods confirmed the successful synthesis of Bi&#8208;BTC/BiYO3/CA. Additionally, the efficient carrier separation and expansion of the light absorption range achieved by the Bi&#8208;BTC/BiYO3 heterojunction were demonstrated. Notably, the photocatalyst retained 91% of its initial degradation efficiency after four recycling cycles, underscoring the potential of the CA&#8208;based composite catalyst for application in simulated wastewater treatment. This synergistic integration of a heterojunction and carrier provides a promising strategy for the effective degradation of environmental pollutants.

         <title>Synergizing Mechanochemistry and Multicomponent Reactions for Sustainable COF Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;free mechanosynthetic strategy was established for constructing quinoline&#8208;linked MCR&#8208;COFs via a three&#8208;component Povarov cascade reaction, and high&#8208;crystallinity products were efficiently synthesized by milling at 15&#160;Hz for 60&#160;min. The as&#8208;prepared MCR&#8208;COFs exhibited high crystallinity, well&#8208;defined permanent porosity, and a maximum specific surface area of 1371.6 m2/g.








ABSTRACT
Mechanochemistry has emerged as a cornerstone of sustainable synthesis, providing an energy&#8208;efficient, solvent&#8208;free alternative to conventional solution&#8208;phase methodologies while minimizing environmental impact. Despite increasing application of mechanochemical approaches for preparing diverse organic compounds, the extension of these strategies to the synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is limited up to now. Notably, the mechanochemical synthesis of multicomponent reaction&#8208;derived COFs (MCR&#8208;COFs) has not been previously reported. Herein, we demonstrate solvent&#8208;free mechanosynthesis of MCR&#8208;COFs through a three&#8208;component Povarov cascade reaction, efficiently combining aldehydes, amines, and phenylacetylenes with tert&#8208;butyl peroxybenzoate as the unique oxidant under one&#8208;pot ball&#8208;milling conditions. The resulting frameworks exhibit exceptional structural regularity, manifested by high crystallinity and well&#8208;defined permanent porosity with surface areas reaching 1371.6 m2/g. Intriguingly, the mechanosynthesized MCR&#8208;COFs exhibit a different stacking mode from the traditional solvothermal counterparts. Remarkably, these mechanosynthesized COFs can be applied to solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical reaction for the first time. This work establishes a paradigm shift in COF synthesis by merging the sustainability benefits of mechanochemistry with the accuracy of three&#8208;component cascade synthesis, while simultaneously advancing the catalytic applications of COF materials through mechanochemistry.

A versatile late&#8208;stage condensation strategy enables a systematic comparative study, revealing how regioisomerism governs the in vivo performance of self&#8208;immobilizing probes.








ABSTRACT
Self&#8208;immobilizing near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorogenic probes based on hemicyanine dyes show great promise for in vivo imaging due to their superior retention efficiency at target sites. However, their broader development and application have been hampered by tedious synthetic routes and insufficient understanding of how structural variations govern performance in complex biological systems. Herein, we report a versatile and efficient late&#8208;stage condensation strategy that provides easy access to a series of self&#8208;immobilizing hemicyanine dyes, enabling the first systematic comparison between 5&#8208; and 7&#8208;regioisomers. Although both probes showed strong fluorogenic responses to alkaline phosphatase in vitro, there in vivo behavior differed remarkably. Unexpectedly, the 5&#8208;substituted probe (P5) exhibited significantly lower tumor retention and imaging contrast in live mice than the 7&#8208;substituted analogue (P7). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and mechanistic studies attributed this divergence to the higher reactivity and slower formation kinetics of the quinone methide intermediate generated from P5, leading to nucleophilic attack by water and rapid diffusion from the detection site in highly dynamic in vivo environments. This study not only offers a practical synthetic route but also establishes regiochemical tuning of QM reactivity and formation kinetics as a crucial design strategy for developing imaging agents suited for in vivo applications.

         <title>Waste&#8208;To&#8208;MOF: Upcycling of Waste Polyimide into Europium&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework as Efficient Fluorescence Sensor of Biogenic Amines</title>

We upcycle waste polyimide into Eu&#8208;MOFs, yielding porous, luminescent materials for ultrasensitive cadaverine detection and portable paper&#8208;based fluorescence sensing under UV light.








ABSTRACT
The fluorescence sensing method based on lanthanide metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) offers high sensitivity, selectivity, and rapid, real&#8208;time detection of biogenic amines (BAs). However, their high cost, complex synthesis, and unclear sensing mechanism limit practical application. Herein, waste polyimide is utilized as a precursor to synthesize Eu&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;benzenetetracarboxylic acid (Eu&#8208;BTEC) via a two&#8208;step hydrothermal&#8211;solution method. Under optimum conditions, the obtained Eu&#8208;BTEC exhibits excellent fluorescence selectivity and sensitivity toward cadaverine, with an apparent constant of 1.58 &#215;106 L&#183;mol&#8722;1 and a detection limit of 0.17 &#181;mol&#183;L&#8722;1. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the amino groups of cadaverine donate electrons to Eu3+, blocking the intramolecular electron transfer from the benzene ligand to Eu3+. Owing to the absence of chromophores in cadaverine, this electron transfer leads to luminescence quenching of Eu&#8208;BTEC. To achieve visual and portable detection, Eu&#8208;BTEC&#8208;based fluorescence test strips were fabricated by spraying its suspension onto filter paper, enabling visual quantification of cadaverine (0.50 &#181;mol&#183;L&#8722;1) under UV light. This study not only provides a sustainable route for converting waste polyimide into Ln&#8208;MOFs but also elucidates the BA sensing mechanism through HOMO&#8208;LUMO band&#8208;gap and electron&#8208;density analyses, offering new insights into the fluorescence quenching process of Ln&#8208;MOFs.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Formazanate Complexes as Tunable Redox&#8208;Active Materials for Non&#8208;Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron&#8208;formazanates were investigated as a chemically tunable and electrochemically robust class of redox&#8208;active materials for nonaqueous flow batteries. Electrochemical characterization, coupled with postmortem analysis, uncovers B&#9472;F bond cleavage as a key degradation pathway contributing to capacity fade. Through rational design, a diphenyl boron derivative was developed that exhibited superior cycling stability in a symmetrical flow cell.








ABSTRACT
As a broad&#8208;scale energy storage solution, redox flow batteries (RFBs) offer high efficiency and tunable design. However, conventional RFBs rely on transition&#8208;metal ion couples, (e.g., vanadium or iron), whose implementation is limited by low energy densities, high cost, and environmental leaching. Main&#8208;group compounds, comprising earth&#8208;abundant, p&#8208;block elements, represent highly promising, yet underexplored candidates for RFBs. Herein, we evaluate three boron&#8208;formazanate complexes as negolyte and symmetric electrolytes in nonaqueous organic redox flow batteries (NAORFBs). Detailed electrochemical characterization of these complexes reveals two sequential reduction processes with the first being exceptionally stable (&lt;3% capacity fade after charge/discharge cycling in a static H&#8208;cell for 3 days). In contrast, cycling that includes the two&#8208;electron reduced state results in rapid degradation (&gt;59% capacity fade over 2.5 days in a static H&#8208;cell), most likely due to fluoride elimination from the BF2 moiety. Guided by these insights, a B(Ph)2 unit was introduced to mitigate this degradation pathway. The elimination of labile B&#9472;F bonds as well as steric protection conferred by two phenyl groups led to improved cycling performance (&gt;85% capacity retention after charge/discharge cycling in a flow battery for 15 days). These findings guide the rational design of inexpensive main&#8208;group electrolytes for application in energy storage.

         <title>Silent Partners in the Mill: Unveiling the Role of Additives in Mechanochemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemistry offers a sustainable, solvent&#8208;free alternative to traditional synthesis, often enhanced by additives in a process known as additive&#8208;assisted grinding. This review discusses how various additives, including liquids, ionic solids, and advanced materials like ionic liquids and piezoelectric compounds, improve reaction efficiency, highlighting their benefits, limitations, and recent developments.








ABSTRACT
Mechanochemistry has attracted significant attention as a sustainable and efficient alternative to solution&#8208;based synthesis, offering the advantage of solvent&#8208;free conditions or the use of only minor amounts of solvent. Many established mechanochemical transformations rely on the use of additives&#8212;a strategy broadly referred to as additive&#8208;assisted grinding. The most employed additives are liquids (liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG)), ionic solids, and non&#8208;ionic additives. Additionally, ionic liquids (ionic liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (IL&#8208;AG)), piezoelectric, or mechanoluminescent materials can be used. This review provides an overview of additive&#8208;assisted organic synthetic transformations under mechanochemical conditions, highlighting the roles, advantages, and limitations of additives, as well as emerging trends from recent literature.

         <title>Orthogonal Relay Catalysis Enabling Diastereodivergent One&#8208;Pot Syntheses: Access to Enders&#8208;Type Products and Syn/Anti&#8208;selective Michael/Mannich Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two stereodivergent syntheses have been developed. One is the one&#8208;pot stereoselective synthesis of C6&#8208;diastereomer of Enders&#8217; domino reaction product and the other one is a diastereodivergent one&#8208;pot asymmetric Michael/Mannich reaction for both anti&#8208; and syn&#8208;isomers. Though one isomer is synthesized using a single catalyst, its diastereomer, which is inaccessible using the similar condition, is obtained using two similar catalysts sequentially.








ABSTRACT
We report two enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent transformations based on a one&#8208;pot relay catalysis strategy. Chiral cyclohexenecarbaldehydes, diastereomeric to the products of Enders&#8217; seminal triple domino reaction, were synthesized with excellent enantioselectivity using two structurally related chiral catalysts in a sequential fashion. While the anti&#8208;isomer was obtained via a one&#8208;pot Michael/Mannich reaction catalyzed by a single chiral catalyst, the complementary syn&#8208;isomer was selectively accessed through sequential addition of two distinct catalysts in a single vessel. In most cases optically pure products were obtained. This one&#8208;pot relay catalysis strategy enables access to complementary stereoisomers and represents a valuable alternative to traditional domino reactions and single&#8208;catalyst one&#8208;pot processes involving independent catalytic cycles.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Chemistry in Biomolecule Quantification: A Review of Reactions and Strategies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the application of catalyst&#8208;free bioorthogonal reactions: Staudinger ligation, strain promoted azide alkyne cycloaddition, inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder, and 2&#8208;cyanobenzothiazole cysteine condensation in the semi&#8208;quantitative and quantitative analysis of biomolecules. These reactions offer fast kinetics, high selectivity, and good biocompatibility, enabling diverse detection strategies for accurate biomolecule quantification.








ABSTRACT
Bioorthogonal chemistry has emerged as a transformative strategy for detecting and quantifying biomolecules in complex biological systems. This review highlights recent advances in catalyst&#8208;free bioorthogonal reactions specifically applied to semi&#8208;quantitative and quantitative biomolecular analysis. We exclude reactions that require toxic or complex catalysts and focus on four reactions: Staudinger ligation, strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition, inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, and 2&#8208;cyanobenzothiazole&#8211;cysteine condensation. For each, we discuss reaction kinetics and strategies for representative applications in biomolecular quantification. The scope of target biomolecules varies by reaction, including proteins, nucleic acids, glycans, and small molecules. Quantification techniques such as fluorescence spectroscopy, luminescence spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry are examined, with reported limits of detection typically ranging from nanomolar to micromolar, and a few advanced techniques reaching femtomolar or attomolar sensitivity. Each reaction is discussed in terms of kinetics, molecular compatibility, and analytical sensitivity. Finally, we outline key challenges and future opportunities, emphasizing the need for faster reaction kinetics, improved probe design, enhanced integration with advanced analytical platforms, and standardized methods to improve reproducibility and cross&#8208;study comparability in biomolecular quantification.

         <title>Helicene&#8208;Based Chiral Macrocycles and Molecular Cages: Synthetic Strategies, Chiroptical Modulation, and Emerging Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview provides a concise overview of recent progress in the design and synthesis of helicene&#8208;based covalent and coordination macrocycles and cages, focusing on advances in synthetic strategies, modulation of chiroptical properties, and emerging opportunities in next&#8208;generation chiral technologies.








ABSTRACT
Macrocycles and molecular cages possess enzyme&#8208;like cavities whose size, shape, and functionality can be precisely engineered.&#160;Helicenes, characterized by rigid &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones and inherent helical chirality, serve as exceptional scaffolds for constructing highly distorted chiral macrocycles and cages.&#160;These supramolecular architectures demonstrate enhanced circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), enantioselective recognition, and efficient guest adsorption.&#160;This minireview provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in helicene&#8208;based coordination and covalent strategies, highlighting synthetic methodologies, chiroptical modulation, and emerging applications.&#160;Key challenges&#8212;including fluorescence quenching in metallacages, synthetic complexity, and limited structural diversity&#8212;are critically discussed. We also highlight potential opportunities involving high&#8208;emission linkages, dynamic covalent strategies, and stimuli&#8208;responsive designs.&#160;Collectively, these insights establish a framework for the rational design of helicene&#8208;derived macrocycles and three&#8208;dimensional cages, paving the way toward the development of advanced chiral functional materials.

         <title>Design of Uniform Polymer Nanoparticles via Living Crystallization Driven Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA), employing a seeded growth method, has emerged as a pivotal strategy for achieving precise control of anisotropic nanoparticles. A critical aspect of this technique lies in heteroepitaxial crystallization, which transcends the chemical composition constraints of conventional homoepitaxy and enables the design of segmented structures with spatially distinct core components.








ABSTRACT
Living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA), employing a seeded growth method, has emerged as a pivotal strategy for achieving precise control of anisotropic nanoparticles over the dimensions and structure, which enables the fabrication of 1D cylinders and 2D platelets with low dispersity. This versatile and robust approach, characterized by linearly tunable dimensions and programmability of structural sequences, has been widely applied in the construction of nanoparticles exhibiting uniform size and controlled architecture. A critical aspect of this technique lies in heteroepitaxial crystallization, which transcends the chemical composition constraints of conventional homoepitaxy and enables the design of segmented structures with spatially distinct core components. Building upon this foundation, we elucidate the key aspects of living CDSA seed growth, with a particular emphasis on exploring the mechanism of governing heteroepitaxial growth from crystalline seeds with distinctly chemical compositions. Elucidating the intricate mechanisms of heteroepitaxial crystallization allows access to broaden the design possibilities for segmented nanoparticles with spatially defined core compositions and functionalities. Moreover, the new developing methods for facile synthesis of uniform particles with high solid concentrations are also reviewed, which are promising for the real applications of these advanced nanomaterials.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Chemical Systems That Mimic Biological Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemists are designing synthetic systems that mimic life's dynamic behaviors, such as motion, sensing, adaptation, and compartmentalization, by integrating reaction networks with stimuli like light, pH, and chemical fuels. This mini&#8208;review surveys molecular machines, responsive materials, nucleic acid networks, and artificial cells, highlighting how chemical design drives the emergence of life&#8208;like functions.








ABSTRACT
Living systems achieve adaptability, motion, and self&#8208;regulation through chemical networks operating out of equilibrium. Reproducing these dynamics synthetically demands precise control over kinetics, thermodynamics, and molecular design to convert energy inputs into time&#8208;programmed function. Recent advances in stimuli&#8208;responsive and chemically powered systems show how life&#8208;like behaviors such as oscillations, autonomous motion, adaptive responses, and compartmentalization can be encoded using fuel&#8208;driven cycles and stimulus&#8208;gated switches powered by chemical, photonic, or enzymatic inputs. This mini&#8208;review highlights molecular assemblies that sustain transient states, molecular machines powered by specific chemical inputs, responsive materials that reconfigure in response to environmental triggers, nucleic acid&#8208;based networks for sensing and regulation, and artificial cells that exhibit compartmentalization and signaling. Together, these developments bridge systems chemistry and biomimicry, expanding the chemical toolkit for engineering matter that can adapt and respond. Beyond mimicking biology, such systems deepen our understanding of the molecular foundations of living matter and open new routes to technology. Self&#8208;powered systems, molecular motors, smart materials, and artificial cells now form a rapidly growing toolbox with the potential to impact drug discovery, biosensing, energy, food production, and materials science. The field's future lies in integrating multiple life&#8208;essential functions into a single construct, ultimately enabling synthetic systems that replicate the complex network behaviors of living organisms and inspire next&#8208;generation innovation.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks as Efficient Photocatalysts for Sustainable Ammonia Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
COFs are an emerging class of porous materials that exhibit excellent photocatalytic and electrocatalytic properties. Photocatalytic sustainable ammonia synthesis is a new research hotspot in the field of photocatalysis, holding significant importance for reducing global carbon emissions. New materials are being employed to address new challenges in emerging fields, demonstrating captivating characteristics. Perhaps, sustainable ammonia synthesis will become the most promising application direction in the coming years, with COFs serving as a key enabler in advancing this process.








ABSTRACT
Ammonia is one of the most important industrial products. The Haber&#8208;Bosch process has enabled large&#8208;scale ammonia production but also results in substantial carbon emissions. Amid growing environmental concerns, there is an urgent need to transform this highly energy&#8208;intensive process and develop ammonia synthesis technologies under mild conditions. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as one of the most prominent emerging materials in recent years, have demonstrated exceptional application potential and advantages in various fields such as photocatalysis and electrocatalysis. The modular structural design of COFs allows for tunable band gaps according to practical requirements, their permanent porosity endows the materials with excellent adsorption capabilities for reactants, and the abundant heteroatoms provide numerous reactive sites. Currently, COFs&#8208;based catalysts have achieved high performance in various photocatalytic applications, and sustainable ammonia synthesis is highly likely to become the next research focus. This review summarizes the fundamental principles of photocatalytic ammonia synthesis, methods for ammonia detection, and the research progress in COFs&#8208;based materials for ammonia synthesis. Finally, it analyzes and discusses the future challenges and prospects of this emerging field of sustainable ammonia synthesis using COFs.

&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ammonia is one of the most important industrial products. The Haber-Bosch process has enabled large-scale ammonia production but also results in substantial carbon emissions. Amid growing environmental concerns, there is an urgent need to transform this highly energy-intensive process and develop ammonia synthesis technologies under mild conditions. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as one of the most prominent emerging materials in recent years, have demonstrated exceptional application potential and advantages in various fields such as photocatalysis and electrocatalysis. The modular structural design of COFs allows for tunable band gaps according to practical requirements, their permanent porosity endows the materials with excellent adsorption capabilities for reactants, and the abundant heteroatoms provide numerous reactive sites. Currently, COFs-based catalysts have achieved high performance in various photocatalytic applications, and sustainable ammonia synthesis is highly likely to become the next research focus. This review summarizes the fundamental principles of photocatalytic ammonia synthesis, methods for ammonia detection, and the research progress in COFs-based materials for ammonia synthesis. Finally, it analyzes and discusses the future challenges and prospects of this emerging field of sustainable ammonia synthesis using COFs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>TEMPO in Solution, Melted, Solid, and Adsorbed on a Silica Surface: A Paramagnetic NMR Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paramagnetic species can often be measured with EPR and NMR spectroscopy. This is demonstrated using the important radical TEMPO. All 1H and 13C NMR signals of TEMPO could be recorded and assigned. The impact of TEMPO on the chemical shifts of solvent signals and a phosphine is described.








ABSTRACT
TEMPO (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1&#8208;piperidinyloxy) is a stable radical that is phenomenologically interesting and of high importance in synthesis and catalysis. This radical has been studied extensively with EPR and used as a spin tag for biological materials and to probe hydrogen bonding. The NMR properties of TEMPO have not yet been reported. This contribution describes that all 1H and 13C NMR signals of TEMPO are visible in the paramagnetic NMR spectra. The 1H NMR spectra of TEMPO solutions have a chemical shift range of 50&#160;ppm and require only 8 scans. The 13C NMR signals are localized within a chemical shift range of 2600&#160;ppm and are obtained within 30 minutes. Samples prepared with different solvents and TEMPO concentrations have been investigated, and it has been demonstrated that all solvents undergo chemical shift changes due to the presence of TEMPO and adduct formation in the case of CDCl3. The impact of TEMPO on the 31P chemical shift of PPh3 is studied. Higher concentrations of TEMPO in solution lead to narrower signals and the molten substance, measured at 60&#176;C, represents the culmination of this trend. It is demonstrated with paramagnetic solid&#8208;state NMR that TEMPO adsorbs on a silica surface and displays the chemical shift and linewidth features of a dilute solution of TEMPO.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Base&#8208;Free Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura [11C]Methylation: Kinetic and Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A base&#8208;free Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura [11C]methylation is achieved in a one&#8208;pot process with [11C]CH3I on moderate yields. Electronic effects enable transmetallation without boronate activation, while kinetics and DFT show oxidative addition (heterolytic) as the rate&#8208;limiting step.








ABSTRACT
The Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction is one of the most powerful approaches for forming carbon&#8211;carbon bonds in the synthesis of carbon&#8208;11&#8211;labeled positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers. Typically, Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling is performed in the presence of a base to activate the boron reagent and sustain the catalytic cycle. Here, we investigate the capacity of the Suzuki reaction to proceed under one&#8208;pot base&#8208;free conditions for [11C]methylation reactions and elucidate the mechanistic features that enable this transformation. Conditions were optimized to successfully achieve one&#8208;pot methylation of a model substrate using [11C]CH3I in the absence of base in moderate yields. Systematic substrate studies reveal that the reaction is partly governed by the electronic properties of the boron substrate, suggesting an alternative transmetallation pathway in this case. Kinetic studies using [14C]CH3I, together with kinetic isotope effect (KIE) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, reveal that oxidative addition remains the rate&#8208;determining step through a heterolytic pathway, consistent with the formation of a cationic Pd(II) intermediate that can undergo transmetallation in the absence of base. Together, these results provide new mechanistic insights into Pd&#8208;mediated [11C]C&#8211;C bond formation under the unique stoichiometric constraints of radiochemical conditions, expanding the understanding of base&#8208;free cross&#8208;coupling reactions with [11C]CH3I.

         <title>Investigating N2 Fixation Using a Bulky Fe(bisphosphine)2 Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bulky Fe(0) N2 complex Fe(N2)(dibpe)2 has been prepared and efficiently produces NH3/N2H4 upon treatment with acid, similarly to previously investigated Fe(N2)(depe)2. However, it performs much less effectively during attempted catalytic N2 fixation, allowing investigation of the crucial role of steric hindrance in steps such as N2 binding and protonation.








ABSTRACT
An iron(0) dinitrogen complex incorporating highly sterically encumbered bisphosphine ligands, Fe(N2)(dibpe)2 (dibpe&#160;= iBu2PCH2CH2PiBu2), iBu1&#183;N2, has been prepared and thoroughly characterized, and its N2 fixation reactivity assessed. iBu1&#183;N2 is a more hindered analogue of Fe(N2)(depe)2 (depe&#160;= Et2PCH2CH2PEt2), Et1&#183;N2, which has previously been shown to be an efficient N2 reduction catalyst with unusual selectivity for N2H4, and it was anticipated that greater bulk might make iBu1&#183;N2 less prone to deleterious side reactivity, improving performance. The N2 ligand in iBu1&#183;N2 displays a similar degree of activation to Et1&#183;N2, and the two complexes can stoichiometrically fix N2 with similarly high efficiency upon treatment with suitable acids, giving mixtures of NH3 and N2H4. However, attempts to catalytically fix N2 via treatment of iBu1&#183;N2 with mixtures of excess acids and reductants led to poor results. Mechanistic investigations implicate a combination of more sluggish reaction kinetics and weaker binding of N2 to the intermediate Fe(I) cation [Fe(dibpe)2]+, [iBu1]+, whose study was aided by isolation as its BArF4&#8722; salt (ArF&#160;= 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl), and which has also been fully characterized. This weak interaction hinders regeneration of the initial iBu1&#183;N2 via reduction of [iBu1&#183;N2]+, which appears to be necessary to close the catalytic cycle.

HXE modulates Cu(A&#946;) interaction, reducing ROS production and shifting peptide aggregation in the presence of Cu from toxic amorphous aggregates to less harmful fibrillar structures. These findings highlight HXE potential to interfere with Cu&#8208;induced oxidative stress and aggregation pathways relevant to AD.








ABSTRACT
The binding of copper ions to amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptide leads to reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and toxic soluble oligomers, contributing to oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, studying compounds with moderate copper affinity is a promising strategy to prevent its interaction with A&#946; and reduce toxicity. Here, we evaluated a new tri&#8208;coordinating thiosemicarbazone (HXE) with chelating properties to regulate cuprotoxicity in AD. The ligand was nontoxic against HT&#8208;22 hippocampal neuronal cells and bound Cu+ and Cu2+ at pH 7.4, with affinity constants (log Kcond) of 8.7 and 12.3, respectively, showing high selectivity over Zn2+ (log Kapp = 5.0). In the presence of A&#946; and Cu2+, HXE formed stable ternary complexes at physiological pH. Ascorbate consumption and coumarin&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acid fluorescence assays showed that the ligand significantly reduces Cu(A&#946;16)&#8208;mediated ROS production. It also prevented Cu2+&#8208;induced modulation of A&#946;40 self&#8208;assembly and restored the typical fibrillar structure of apo&#8208;A&#946;40 aggregates. Overall, HXE effectively modulates metal&#8208;associated A&#946; toxicity and emerges as a promising candidate for AD bioinorganic management.

         <title>Rectifying Contact&#8208;induced Electronic Regulation of Fe Within Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>

The rectifying contact between Fe nanoparticles and N&#8208;doped 3D honeycomb&#8208;like carbon can induce a built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) for optimizing charge redistribution of activity center, thereby endowing Fe&#8208;NPs@N&#8208;HC with excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in alkaline medium and zinc air battery performance.








ABSTRACT
Developing efficient and durable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts from earth&#8208;abundant elements is of great significance for the advancement of sustainable energy technologies such as rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries. Herein, we present a 3D honeycomb&#8208;like nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix decorated to in&#8208;situ form Fe nanoparticles (denoted as Fe&#8208;NPs@N&#8208;HC) via an ice&#8208;templating method. Theoretical calculations and experimental analyses collectively reveal that the work function mismatch between metallic Fe and the N&#8208;doped carbon host drives spontaneous charge transfer, establishing a built&#8208;in electric field at the heterointerface to form the rectifying contact. This interfacial effect fine tunes electronic structure and optimizes the adsorption of oxygen intermediates, thereby accelerating the ORR kinetics. Benefiting from these synergistic effects, Fe&#8208;NPs@N&#8208;HC achieves a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.86&#160;V, superior tolerance to methanol, and excellent long&#8208;term durability in alkaline media. When integrated into a liquid zinc&#8208;air battery, Fe&#8208;NPs@N&#8208;HC also delivers a high peak power density of 126.4&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and outstanding cycling stability exceeding 482 cycles, surpassing the benchmark Pt/C&#8208;based system. This work demonstrates that tailoring the electronic structure through interfacial engineering, coupled with rational 3D framework design, provides a promising strategy for the development of next&#8208;generation nonprecious metal catalysts for practical energy conversion applications.

         <title>A BODIPY/Coumarin Hybrid Probe for Dual&#8208;Mode Fluorescent/FLIM Imaging of Endoplasmic Reticulum Micro&#8208;Polarity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed an ER&#8208;targeted probe&#160;MBDP&#160;via hybridizing coumarin and BODIPY fluorophores, by introducing a benzene to reduce dihedral angles and a methyl group to inhibit intramolecular rotation, enabling specific polarity response. It has a broad linear response and strong anti&#8208;interference, quantifies ER micro&#8208;polarity via dual&#8208;channel and lambda mode imaging, captures ER micro&#8208;polarity changes under stress and hippocampal regional differences, and its notable lifetime variations with micro&#8208;polarity changes endow MBDP with FLIM capability.








ABSTRACT
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) micro&#8208;polarity, with its spatial heterogeneity and dynamic changes, regulates key physiological processes like protein folding and lipid metabolism. Its abnormal alterations under pathological conditions, such as oxidative stress are closely linked to metabolic diseases and tumors. Capturing these subtle dynamics to reveal connections with organelle dysfunction remains a critical challenge. Existing traditional physical approaches are complex and cannot achieve real&#8208;time spatial imaging. Fluorescent probes for polarity sensing could provide spatiotemporal resolution, nevertheless, suffer from unstable signals due to nonfixed dual channels, narrow response ranges, interference from viscosity, and nonlinear responses, hindering quantitative monitoring. We designed an ER&#8208;targeted probe MBDP via hybridizing coumarin and BODIPY fluorophores, by introducing a benzene to reduce dihedral angles and a methyl group to inhibit intramolecular rotation, enabling specific polarity response. It shows a broad linear response, strong anti&#8208;interference ability, which quantifies ER micro&#8208;polarity via dual&#8208;channel and lambda mode imaging. It captures ER micro&#8208;polarity changes under stress and hippocampal regional differences. Moreover, the remarkable lifetime variations upon polarity change endow MBDP capability under fluorescence lifetime imaging microscope (FLIM). This probe provides a powerful tool with ratiometric imaging and FLIM dual&#8208;modal monitoring for ER micro&#8208;polarity, aiding in revealing ER&#8208;related physiological/pathological mechanisms and disease research.

2&#8242;&#8208;O,4&#8242;&#8208;C&#945;&#8208;dimethyl nucleic acids (24mNA) were synthesized, and their biophysical properties in RNA and in RNA editing were evaluated. 24mNA modulate duplex thermal stability in an analog&#8208;dependent manner, and based on crystal structures of mono&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;Me&#8208;containing RNA, the 4&#8242;&#8208;Me group projects toward the minor groove of the duplex. Additionally, 24mNA imparts high site specificity for RNA editing 5&#8217;&#8208;UA and 5&#8217;&#8208;AA ADAR targets.








ABSTRACT
Oligonucleotides capable of guiding adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) to carry out therapeutic adenosine (A) to inosine (I) editing constitute a promising new class of nucleic acid therapeutics. However, our understanding of the impact of different chemical modifications at the various nucleotide positions in ADAR guide strands is limited. While ribose 2&#8242; modification is common in ADAR&#8208;directing guides, less is known about the impact of modification at the 4&#8242; position. Here we describe the synthesis of several 4&#8242;&#8208;C&#945;&#8208;methyl and 2&#8242;&#8208;O, 4&#8242;&#8208;C&#945;&#8208;dimethyl derivatives of adenosine, uridine, and cytidine and their incorporation into RNA. In addition, we show that these analogs maintain the base pairing selectivity of their parent nucleoside and modulate duplex thermal stability in an analog&#8208;dependent manner. High&#8208;resolution crystal structures of RNA duplexes bearing 4&#8242;&#8208;C&#945;&#8208;methyl A or U showed that these analogs adopt a C3&#8242;&#8208;endo sugar pucker and project 4&#8242; substituents into the minor groove. Finally, we find that 2&#8242;&#8208;O, 4&#8242;&#8208;C&#945;&#8208;dimethyluridine and 2&#8242;&#8208;O, 4&#8242;&#8208;C&#945;&#8208;dimethyladenosine strategically positioned in ADAR guide strands can increase the selectivity of the editing reaction for target sequences with adjacent off&#8208;target adenosines. This work advances our understanding of the ADAR reaction mechanism and informs the design of ADAR guide strands with improved selectivity.

         <title>Cobalt(II) Single&#8208;Chain Magnet With Strong Anisotropy and Ferromagnetic IntraChain Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new high&#8208;performance single&#8208;chain magnet (Ueff = 560 K) exhibits strong magnetic anisotropy and ferromagnetic intrachain interactions using redox&#8208;active bridging ligands.








ABSTRACT
Co(II)&#8208;based coordination polymer is reported as a new benchmark single&#8208;chain magnet (SCM), exhibiting an energy barrier (Ueff) of 560 K and a blocking temperature (TB) of 21.5 K&#8210;both the highest values observed for SCM systems. The magnetic behavior originates from the synergistic balance between strong axial anisotropy (DCo = &#8211;83 cm&#8722;1) and moderate ferromagnetic exchange (JCo&#8208;Co = +17.7 K), promoting long&#8208;range spin correlation over thousands of magnetic ions. Detailed analysis of the correlation length and domain&#8208;wall energy reveals a wide SCM regime and a 1D&#8208;to&#8208;3D magnetic crossover at low temperature. Unlike previously reported radical&#8208;bridged SCMs, this work demonstrates a clean, intrinsic design strategy for realizing extreme single&#8208;chain magnetism, offering new principles for developing robust molecular spin materials.

         <title>Acridane[4]Arenes: Scope of the Macro&#8208;Tetramerization, Derivatization Options, and Water&#8208;Soluble Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acridane[4]arenes (A4As) are introduced as a versatile, conformationally restricted macrocyclic platform accessible in six steps and good yields. Expanded lower&#8208;rim scope, selective upper&#8208;rim functionalization, and N&#8208;Boc modification enable controlled self&#8208;assembly into a dimeric cage that binds tetrabutylammonium salts. Further Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig diversification and ionic substituents afford water&#8208;soluble derivatives, establishing A4As as a broadly modular scaffold for supramolecular applications.








ABSTRACT
Macrocycles are essential scaffolds in supramolecular chemistry, offering versatile platforms for functionalization. Here, we report the optimization, expanded scope, and comprehensive derivatization strategies for acridane[4]arenes (A4A), a large macrocyclic platform featuring a conformationally restricted bowl shape analogous to resorcin[4]arene. The scope of the macrocyclization was expanded with four distinct &#8216;feet&#8217; substituents at the lower rim. Strategies for selective functionalization at the upper rim were developed, including&#160;N&#8208;Boc protection at each acridane subunit. This modification induced self&#8208;assembly into a dimeric cage in apolar solvents, which form stable host&#8211;guest complexes with tetrabutylammonium salts. Further functionalization of the acridane nitrogen via Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig cross&#8208;coupling allowed installation of aromatic groups bearing diverse functional handles. Finally, water&#8208;soluble A4A derivatives were achieved by introducing charged ionic &#8216;feet&#8217; substituents, such as 1&#8208;methylimidazolium. These results establish A4As as a highly modular macrocyclic platform with broad potential for supramolecular applications.

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Hydrothiomethylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hermetically sealable, inexpensive 42&#8208;well aluminum reactor blocks are used to explore new reactivities of air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;sensitive titanium catalysts. As a result, methyl sulfides undergo efficient &#945;&#8208;alkylation with alkenes in the presence of a titanium catalyst precursor, a formamidinato ligand, and a Lewis acid, yielding branched hydrothiomethylation products with excellent regioselectivity. Graphical design by Melissa Schl&#252;schen.








ABSTRACT
A catalyst screening for six different &#945;&#8208;alkylation reactions of methyl sulfides with unsaturated substrates performed in hermetically sealable and inexpensive 42&#8208;well aluminum reactor blocks is described. As a result, a new titanium&#8208;catalyzed hydrothiomethylation reaction of alkenes, which takes place under C&#9472;H bond activation at the &#945;&#8208;carbon atom of simple methyl sulfides, is presented. The best catalyst is prepared in situ from the readily available titanium catalyst precursor Ti(CH2SiMe3)4, a formamidinato ligand precursor, and the Lewis acid [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4]. Although selected 1,2&#8208;disubstituted alkenes, for example, cyclohexene and cyclopentene, undergo successful hydrothiomethylation reactions, the best results are obtained with monosubstituted 1&#8208;alkenes. In these cases, the reactions take place with excellent regioselectivity and give branched hydrothiomethylation products exclusively (23 examples). When dimethyl sulfide is used as a substrate, either the monohydrothiomethylation product or the dihydrothiomethylation product can be obtained with very good selectivity.

         <title>Resolving a Nearly Two&#8208;Centuries&#8208;Old Mystery: On the Structural Chemistry and Physicochemical Properties of Compounds Associated With the Term Ammelide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal structure of ammelide, also known as melanuric acid, was solved almost 200 years after its discovery by Liebig. Moreover, three modifications of its 1:1 adduct with ammeline were structurally elucidated, consisting of layers with a honeycomb motif analogous to melamine cyanurate. Finally, ammelide's nitrate and perchlorate salts were prepared to examine the potential of ammelide as part of insensitive high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials.








ABSTRACT
Ammelide, also known as melanuric acid, is a simple molecular compound, which can be regarded as the double hydrolysis product of the industrially relevant compound melamine. Within this work, the first structural description of ammelide was provided almost 200 years after its discovery. This not only gave the first unambiguous evidence that ammelide's preferred tautomeric form in the solid is 6&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4(1H,3H)&#8208;dione, but also showed that ammelide adopts a layered structure similar to the closely related ammeline. Moreover, the crystal structures of three modifications of the 1:1 adduct between ammeline and ammelide were elucidated, which form layers with a honeycomb motif and hexagonal voids analogous to melamine cyanurate. Differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetric analysis demonstrated that both pure ammelide and its adduct with ammeline have exceptionally high thermal stabilities, resulting from their dense hydrogen bonding networks. Finally, the synthesis and structural characterization of the ammelide's nitrate and perchlorate salts were carried out to examine the potential of ammelide as part of insensitive high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials through sensitivity measurements and theoretical calculations.

         <title>Partial Phase Transition to Construct Amorphous&#8208;Crystalline Heterophase Catalyst for Enhanced CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents an alkali salt&#8208;assisted annealing method to precisely synthesize CoMnOx with tunable crystallinity and systematically elucidating the structure&#8208;activity dependency between crystallinity and CO2 photoreduction performance.








ABSTRACT
Amorphous/crystalline catalysts can effectively integrate the advantages of both phases, overcoming the low active site density in crystalline phases and the poor charge separation in amorphous ones. In this work, we report an alkali salt&#8208;assisted partial phase transition strategy to synthesize amorphous/crystalline CoMnOx&#8208;400 nanosheets for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared CoMnOx&#8208;400 demonstrates superior CO production performance (146.09 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, 93.6% selectivity), significantly outperforming amorphous CoMnOx&#8208;260 (66.65 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and crystalline CoMnOx&#8208;500 (89.52 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Supported by systematic characterizations, we propose that the high efficiency of CoMnOx&#8208;400 is attributed to two factors: (i) the charge migration between amorphous and crystalline phases across the seamless contact interface can enhance charge separation efficiency, and (ii) the amorphous domains can provide abundant surface defective active sites for CO2 adsorption and activation. This work highlights the critical role of phase engineering, particularly the construction of amorphous/crystalline structures, in advancing solar&#8208;driven catalytic applications.

         <title>Deciphering the Molecular Mechanisms of Phosphoester Bond Formation in Abiotic Conditions With Reactive Neural Network Potentials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>This study explores how phosphoester bonds, essential in biology, could form without enzymes in early Earth conditions. Using machine&#8208;learned interatomic potentials, it maps reaction pathways of two phosphate forms in water. The role of solvent in assisting proton transfers is analyzed, revealing key effects with implications for prebiotic chemistry.








ABSTRACT
Phosphoester bonds are fundamental components of both small molecules and polymeric biomolecules, most notably nucleic acids. Their formation from alcohol groups and phosphate is a significant challenge for living systems, as it involves substantial free&#8208;energy barriers. These barriers, while hindering bond formation, also ensure the kinetic stability of the resulting biomolecular structures. This duality presents a major obstacle in understanding the emergence of RNA&#8208;based systems at the origins of life, where protein enzymes capable of catalyzing such reactions were absent. Understanding the mechanisms underlying phosphoester formation is therefore essential for developing non&#8208;biological catalytic strategies. In a recent proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study (Benayad et&#160;al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 121 e2322040121 (2024)), we demonstrated that machine&#8208;learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) can be effectively trained and employed to sample the reactive pathways of the uncatalyzed reaction in water on microsecond timescales. In this work, we significantly expand upon our previous analysis to offer a detailed molecular characterization of two families of mechanisms, associative and dissociative, each associated with a variety in the order of proton exchange events. We focus on the two protonation states of phosphate prevalent under near&#8208;neutral conditions (H2PO4&#8722;${\rm H}_2{\rm PO}_{4}^-$ and HPO42&#8722;${\rm HPO}_{4}^{2-}$). We find that dissociative pathways are consistently lower in free&#8208;energy as compared to associative ones, and that H2PO4&#8722;${\rm H}_2{\rm PO}_{4}^-$ is much more reactive than HPO42&#8722;${\rm HPO}_{4}^{2-}$. Special attention is given to the role of the solvent, elucidating its involvement in the reaction process, as well as the contributions of proton transfer events and oxygen substitution at the phosphorus center. We conclude by proposing molecular&#8208;level explanations for the observed differences in reactivity between the two phosphate protonation states based on charge redistribution during the&#160;reaction.

         <title>Twisted 1&#8208; and 2&#8208;Azaperopyrenes: Synthesis, Structure, and Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
A synthesis of hitherto unknown 1&#8208; and 2&#8208;azaperopyrenes, twisted nitrogen&#8208;doped peropyrenes, is reported. The synthesis is based on a Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;mediated benzannulation of alkynes. Key alkyne intermediates are synthesized via two complementary routes, including a Pd/C&#8208;catalyzed, copper&#8208; and amine&#8208;free Sonogashira&#8208;type coupling of (hetero)aryl chlorides, enabling access to both carbo&#8208; and heteroatom&#8208;substituted peropyrene frameworks. X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals twisted conformations with bay and end&#8208;to&#8208;end twist angles ranging between 10.0&#8211;19.9&#176; and 5.5&#8211;25.0&#176;, respectively, as well as unprecedented conformational isomorphism. The influence of regioselective single N&#8208;doping within the twisted peropyrene framework on the photophysical and electrochemical properties were elucidated by combined experimental and computational studies and compared with those of the carbon congener.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Dependent DNA Binding and Cytotoxicity of Palladium(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In palladium(II) complexes with the general formula [PdAB2], the choice of the bidentate ligand A drives a different binding mode toward double&#8208;stranded DNA and is crucial for conferring cytotoxic properties to these complexes. The 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligand renders Pd(II) complexes cytotoxic, whereas (1R,2R)&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocycloexanerenders&#160;them inactive.








ABSTRACT
In the search for alternatives to platinum anticancer drugs, palladium complexes have attracted considerable interest. In this frame, six square planar palladium(II) complexes with the general formula [PdAB2] were prepared, where the ligand A is (1R,2R)&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (DACH) or 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (Phen), and the ligand B is chlorine, iodine, or pyridine. The biological properties of the investigated compounds were systematically evaluated to identify trends linked to ligand variations. The complexes were synthesized following established experimental procedures and characterized by elemental analysis and NMR spectroscopy. DNA interactions were investigated through melting experiments and the ethidium bromide (EB) displacement assay. The obtained data suggested covalent adduct formation as the preferential binding mode for the DACH&#8208;containing complexes, whereas intercalation was predominant for the phenanthroline&#8208;based complexes. Notably, at least one compound appears to interact with DNA through both modes. Cytotoxic activity was evaluated against three human ovarian cancer cell lines (A2780, A2780R, and SKOV3) as well as a healthy control cell line (HSkM, human skeletal myoblasts). Significant cytotoxic activity was observed for the Phen&#8208;containing complexes, with compound 3 also showing a good selectivity index. Conversely, DACH&#8208;containing complexes were found to be non&#8208;cytotoxic.

         <title>Harnessing MOF Derived Frustrated Lewis Pair&#8208;CeO2 Nano Catalyst for CO2&#8208;Activated Soft Oxidation of Furfural to Furoic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
CO2 as a soft oxidant is scarcely explored in literature for furfural oxidation to furoic acid, and where CeO2, capitalizes on the synergistic effect of FLPs for enhanced CO2 reduction and furfural oxidation. This study presents a comparative analysis by the synthesis method to produce hydrothermal and MOF&#8208;derived CeO2 nanocatalyst and their effect on the formation of oxygen vacancies and metastable Ce3+ ions. The normalized surface concentration derived from XPS At% and specific surface area effectively quantifies accessible Ce3+ sites and oxygen vacancies, capturing FLP sites. Oxygen vacancies near surface Ce3+ sites (FLPs) critically modulated the catalytic performance, and evidenced by high turnover number (TON). FTIR adsorption study revealed that CO2 forms bidentate carbonate species and furfural, bi&#8208;coordination via &#951;2&#8208; (C, O) mode on the catalyst surface. Further active site masking strategy helped to understand and validate the crucial role of FLPs. The Central Composite Design model was utilized to optimize the reaction conditions and obtained high furfural conversion (99%) and furoic acid selectivity (99%). The catalyst was resistant to active site leaching and exhibited excellent stability, recyclability, and robustness. The findings highlight a potential pathway for the catalytic soft oxidation of furfural to furoic acid by CO2 utilization.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Phosphorus Cross&#8208;Anion Coupling on Rare&#8208;Earth Center</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of rare&#8208;earth azametallacyclopentadienes toward disubstituted phosphorus oxides provides a new class of seven&#8208;membered rare&#8208;earth metallacycles containing a C&#9552;P double bond. Mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction proceeds through two steps: the activation of the P&#9472;H bond of disubstituted phosphorus oxides, and a formal reductive elimination process leading to the formation of a C&#9472;P bond. PIO analyses are applied to better understand the bonding properties and electron flow of the essential transition states.








ABSTRACT
Carbon&#8208;phosphorus cross&#8208;anion coupling reaction on rare&#8208;earth center is implemented through formal reductive elimination process. Phosphine oxides with different substituents are treated to prove the universality of this method. Computational approaches are applied to confirm that the reaction generated a C&#9552;P double bond during the process, and the two&#8208;electron reductive elimination process occurs with the assistance of the butadienyl backbone. The orbital interactions of the key transition states are clarified by principal interacting orbital (PIO) analysis. This work significantly expands the applicability of rare&#8208;earth metallacycles and further reveals their unique reactivity, providing a C&#9472;P coupling, azametallacycle, metallacycle, rare&#8208;earth metal novel strategy for constructing phosphorus&#8208;containing compounds.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Preactivation of 3DPAFIPN into Highly Active Photocatalytic Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In order to avoid competitive radical substitution of the CN group, the pre&#8208;irradiation of 3DPAFIPN (ReAct&#8208;Light) resulted in the formation of cyclic photocatalyst derivatives PC1 and PC2. The thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;ene reaction demonstrated greater catalytic performance and stability of the PC1/PC2 forms in comparison to the initial 3DPAFIPN and the in situ generated CN&#8208;substituted photocatalyst form (PC3).








ABSTRACT
Cyanoarene photocatalysts such as 3DPAFIPN are widely employed in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven transformations, yet their intrinsic structural dynamics under irradiation remain poorly understood. Here we reveal that 3DPAFIPN undergoes light&#8208;induced reconfiguration into distinct cyclized and radical substitution products, with the parent species ultimately decomposing under reaction conditions. Using a combination of Photo&#8208;Chem&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS and TLC&#8208;mapping, we directly monitored the evolution of catalytic forms and identified the cyclized derivatives as the true active species in thiol&#8211;yne&#8211;ene coupling. The major cyclized product was isolated and structurally confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, providing unambiguous experimental evidence for light&#8208;driven photocatalyst reconfiguration. Compared with the precursor, the cyclized catalysts display enhanced stability against cyanide substitution by radical intermediates and deliver higher efficiency and selectivity. This study establishes a generalizable workflow for dissecting dynamic photocatalyst behavior and extends the ReAct&#8208;Light concept, highlighting light&#8208;triggered structural evolution as a new design principle for adaptive and robust photocatalytic systems.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Functionalization of 4&#8208;Methylcoumarins: A Vinylogous Nucleophile Perspective</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective offers an in&#8208;depth summary of recent progress in catalytic asymmetric remote C&#8211;H functionalization of 4&#8208;alkylcoumarins as pro&#8208;vinylogous nucleophiles. It further outlines prospective strategies for designing efficient catalytic systems to enable new transformations, emphasizing their emerging significance and unexplored potential in medicinal chemistry.








ABSTRACT
The broad utility of coumarin scaffolds has long intrigued organic chemists, driving extensive research into their synthesis and functionalization. Over the decades, functionalized coumarins have emerged as privileged frameworks in natural products, biologically and pharmaceutically relevant molecules, as well as in dyes and advanced materials. While numerous strategies have been developed for C&#8211;H functionalization at the C&#8208;3, C&#8208;4, and C&#8208;7 positions through organo&#8208;, metal&#8208;, and photocatalytic methods, the pursuit of remote C&#8211;H functionalization in coumarin analogues, particularly as an alternative mode of activation that harnesses their vinylogous nucleophilicity remains both compelling and challenging. This perspective provides a comprehensive overview of recent catalytic advances in the asymmetric remote C&#8211;H functionalization of 4&#8208;alkylcoumarins as pro&#8208;vinylogous nucleophiles. It also highlights future directions for the development of efficient catalytic systems to unlock novel transformations, underscoring their untapped potential in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Flexizyme&#8208;Based Strategy for the Synthesis of Stable, Non&#8208;Isomerizable Amide&#8208;Linked 2&#8217;&#8208;Aminoacyl&#8208;tRNAs and their Shortened Analogs</title>

         <dc:description>
In this study, we reveal that flexizymes, engineered ribozymes known for strict 3&#8217;&#8208;regiospecific aminoacylation, unexpectedly generate the elusive 2&#8217;&#8208;amide aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA analog from 2&#8217;&#8208;amine&#8208;containing tRNA (2&#8217;&#8208;NH2&#8208;tRNA) and ester&#8208;activated amino acid (AA&#8208;DBE). A fast two&#8208;step mechanism enables efficient formation of stable 2&#8217;&#8208;amide AA&#8208;tRNAs, uncovering an unanticipated facet of flexizyme catalytic versatility.








ABSTRACT
The study of the regiospecificity of aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA (AA&#8208;tRNA)&#8208;dependent enzymes and their structural characterization with AA&#8208;tRNAs are limited by rapid hydrolysis of the ester bond linking amino acid to tRNA. To overcome this limitation, stable AA&#8208;tRNA analogs bearing hydrolysis&#8208;resistant linkages, such as amide bonds or ester bioisosteres, have been developed. These analogs are valuable tools for investigating interactions between AA&#8208;tRNAs and various enzymes or ribonucleoproteins, including elongation factors, ribosomes, Fem&#8208;family transferases, and cyclodipeptide synthases. However, their synthesis remains technically challenging. Recently, flexizymes&#8212;engineered ribozymes capable of aminoacylating tRNAs with diverse amino acids or analogs&#8212;have enabled the synthesis of 3&#8242;&#8208;amide&#8208;linked AA&#8208;NH&#8208;tRNAs. Due to their inherent specificity for 3&#8242;&#8208;OH acylation, flexizymes have not been used to generate 2&#8242;&#8208;amide&#8208;linked analogs, and such regioisomers have remained unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that while flexizymes cannot directly aminoacylate the 2&#8242; position, they can nevertheless mediate the synthesis of 2&#8242;&#8208;aminoacyl&#8208;NH&#8208;tRNAs via a two&#8208;step regioisomerization mechanism with excellent yields. This finding provides new insights into the binding mode of AA&#8208;tRNAs to flexizymes and expands the chemical space of stable AA&#8208;tRNA analogs. Access to both 3&#8242;&#8208; and 2&#8242;&#8208;amide regioisomers will enable more precise studies of AA&#8208;tRNA recognition and catalysis by various AA&#8208;tRNA&#8208;dependent systems.

         <title>Azoheteroarene&#8208;Modified Grapiprants Serving as Photoswitchable EP4 Antagonists</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modification of the anti&#8208;inflammatory drug grapiprant by azoheteroarenes renders it a reversibly light&#8208;controllable EP4 antagonist. In vitro cell&#8208;based EP4 activity studies revealed that the cis isomer of the lead antagonist, which relatively strongly binds with the EP4 receptor involving its compact T&#8208;shaped geometry, was 1.8&#8208;fold more potent than its trans isomer.








ABSTRACT
Photopharmacology offers a novel approach to eliminate side effects of chemotherapy treatment via site&#8208;specific activation of light&#8208;active anticancer agents, which are typically constructed by the installation of light&#8208;cleavable or light&#8208;switchable molecules onto known drugs or inhibitors. The light&#8208;switchable drugs being able to reversibly control biological activities are more advantageous, but the design of such compounds is very challenging. We synthesized a small series of photoswitchable S&#8208;arylsulfonylurea&#8208;based EP4 antagonists by substituting a core structural unit of a potent EP4 antagonist, grapiprant. In vitro cell&#8208;based EP4 activity studies revealed that all light&#8208;induced cis isomers of these compounds are more potent than their trans isomers. Compound 3, with an azopyrazole photoswitch and a para&#8208;methyl substitution in the S&#8208;phenyl ring, displayed the highest EP4 antagonism by its cis isomer and a considerably larger activity difference (ca. 1.8&#8208;fold) between trans and cis photoisomers. It showed (near) complete photoisomerization (&#8764;95%&#8211;98%) upon 365&#160;nm (forward) and 520&#160;nm (reverse) light irradiations. The metastable cis isomers demonstrated high thermal stability (t1/2 = 1&#8211;3 days). All compounds were resistant to photobleaching and showed impressive stability for reduction with glutathione (10&#160;mM). This study constitutes a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept to design photoswitchable EP4 antagonists, and the structure&#8208;activity relationship revealed herein may help design more potent grapiprant derivatives.

         <title>Intermediate CuIIATCUN Species Reacts With Biomolecules Within Time Windows of Biological Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have demonstrated that a partially coordinated intermediate species formed in a multistep reaction of the Cu(II) ion with a model peptide representing the N&#8208;terminus of Human Serum Albumin exhibits remarkable lability and redox&#8208;activity, which strongly supports its physiological relevance.








ABSTRACT
The ATCUN motif is the N&#8208;terminal peptide/protein sequence Xaa&#8208;Zaa&#8208;His, bearing the N&#8208;terminal amine and Zaa &#8800; Pro, which effectively binds some transition metal ions including CuII in a square&#8208;planar geometry. This motif has attracted much attention, due to its distinctive copper binding properties and abundance in human proteome. However, the inertness and poor reactivity of CuIIATCUN complexes appear at odds with the biological reality of dynamically changing copper balance, which is maintained through redox and trans&#8208;chelation reactions. We have demonstrated a multi&#8208;step character of Cu2+ binding to ATCUN sequences, with partially coordinated intermediate species present within time windows spanning from hundreds of milliseconds to seconds. Based on indirect evidence and chemical analogy we previously proposed that these transient species could serve as reactive intermediates in biological copper redox and exchange reactions. Here we used double mixing stopped&#8208;flow experiments to address this issue directly for a model tetrapeptide (DAHK) representing the ATCUN motif at the N&#8208;terminus of Human Serum Albumin. We found that, unlike the final 4&#8208;nitrogen coordinated (4N) square&#8208;planar complex, the transient 2N intermediate readily exchanged CuII with histidine and was rapidly reduced to CuI by glutathione. These results pave way to re&#8208;evaluation of physiological roles of ATCUN motifs.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Strategies for Generating Polymer Protocells That Mimic Cellular Communication</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on polymeric protocells produced using a bottom&#8208;up approach. Polymer&#8208;based assemblies guarantee stability and designability by adjusting the properties of the amphiphilic copolymers used. The review covers protocell architectures, production, and their intra&#8208; and intercellular communication mechanisms.








ABSTRACT
In the last decade, the design of artificial organelles and cells has emerged as an area with far&#8208;reaching implications due to the potential that such systems have for both understanding bioprocesses in a simple and controlled manner, and for developing advanced solutions for medical applications. Significant efforts have been devoted to developing artificial organelles and cells as single compartments or compartments&#8208;in&#8208;compartments to enable the study of internal reactions. However, a major challenge in approaching natural processes is to be able to mimic complex signaling and communication pathways. In this review, we present bottom&#8208;up strategies that introduce polymer&#8208;based protocells for studying intra&#8208; and intercellular communication. Whereas intracellular communication involves in situ reactions that are triggered by an external stimulus, intercellular communication is achieved by exchange of chemical signals between two different types of protocell, the &#8220;sender&#8221; and &#8220;receiver.&#8221; By spatially segregating different molecules and nano&#8208;assemblies that serve as artificial organelles in sender and receiver protocells, respectively, various reactions have been studied, including single and cascade enzymatic reactions. Such interconnected systems, which facilitate exchange and flow of information in a close&#8208;to&#8208;nature manner, increase our insight into complex natural signaling pathways and hold promise for creation of programmable artificial cell&#8208; and tissue&#8208;like systems for tomorrow's medicine.

         <title>Bis&#8208;Guanidinate Scaffold for the Construction of Unique Zr(IV)&#8208;Li(I) Heterobimetallic Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique heterobimetallic compounds of Zr/Li, 1 and 2, are reported. Compound 1 adopts a dimeric structure in the solid state, whereas compound 2 forms a polymeric chain, composed of repeating CpZr&#8208;BG&#8211;LiCp units. As a proof of concept, the hydroboration of nitriles was investigated: compound 2 exhibited better catalytic activity than compound 1 under neat conditions.








ABSTRACT
Herein, we report bis&#8208;guanidinate (BG)&#8208;bridged heterobimetallic lithium&#8211;zirconium organometallic compounds, revealing new dimensions of ligand&#8208;induced structural versatility. Reactions of lithiated salts of bis&#8208;guanidinates bearing 2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl (XylLLi) or 2,6&#8208;diethylphenyl (DepLLi) aryl&#8208;substituents (where L&#160;= {(ArHN)(ArN)&#8211;C&#9552;N&#8211;C&#9552;(NAr)(NHAr)}; Ar&#160;= Xyl&#160;= 2,6&#8208;Me2C6H3 or Dep&#160;= 2,6&#8208;Et2C6H3) with Cp2ZrHCl (Schwartz's reagent) in benzene proceed via elimination of H2 and HCl to afford well&#8208;defined Li/Zr heterobimetallic complexes. The formation of these heterobimetallic compounds was confirmed by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy (1H, 13C{1H}, and &#8311;Li and DOSY NMR) and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Structural analysis shows that the LX&#8208;type bis&#8208;guanidinate framework in LLi undergoes conversion to an unprecedented L2X3 coordination mode, wherein the ligand acts as trianionic (tritopic) toward zirconium and neutral (ditopic) toward lithium, generating two four&#8208;membered and one six&#8208;membered metallacycles. Solid&#8208;state analysis reveals pronounced structural diversity, with one complex adopting a dimeric arrangement and the other forming a zig&#8208;zag coordination polymer composed of CpZr&#8211;bis&#8208;guanidinate&#8211;LiCp units. Notably, the polymeric complex exhibits catalytic activity, showing efficient dihydroboration of nitriles under neat conditions and effective hydroboration of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones, carbodiimide, alkyne, and isocyanates, highlighting the catalytic relevance of polymeric BG&#8208;supported Li/Zr architecture.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Enolate Enabled Chemoselective Twofold Allylation of Alkenyl&#8208;Keto&#8208;Imines Using Allylboronic Acids: Asymmetric Construction of Nonadjacent Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exclusive chemoselective asymmetric allylation on imine of &#945;&#8208;keto&#8208;imines is developed through in situ generation of a key boron&#8208;enolate intermediate. Our previously achieved allylation&#8208;oxy&#8208;Cope rearrangement sequence was utilized for the enolate formation, which was reacted with a second allylboronic acid nucleophile, giving rise to valuable chiral &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;ketones bearing both adjacent and nonadjacent stereocenters.








ABSTRACT
A twofold allylation strategy is developed for the efficient synthesis of chiral &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;ketones bearing both adjacent and nonadjacent stereocenters including quaternary ones. Both linear and branched&#8208;allyl moieties were incorporated using either same or different nucleophiles through successive chemoselective allylations on alkenyl&#8208;keto&#8208;imines in a single operation. Notably, in the whole reaction sequence, while the first allyl nucleophile reacts selectively on ketone, the second one reacts on imine. Control experiments and DFT calculations supported the proposed reaction mechanism.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Based Antioxidant Agents: Understanding Structure&#8211;Activity Relationships in Biological Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese (Mn)&#8208;based materials are promising for treating diseases caused by oxidative stress. This review summarizes how their structure affects antioxidant activities, focusing on Mn valence, composition, size, and shape. It also highlights their roles in immune regulation and cellular protection against oxidative damage. Finally, challenges and perspectives on future research are provided.








ABSTRACT
Eliminating reactive oxygen species has emerged as an effective therapeutic strategy for diseases related to oxidative stress, such as inflammation, neurodegenerative diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. Manganese (Mn) is an essential component of natural antioxidant enzymes, for example, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), thus has been extensively used to design artificial antioxidants. This review provides a systematic summary of how the structural engineering of Mn&#8208;based antioxidant agents influences their SOD/CAT&#8208;like activity. Critical structural parameters, such as Mn valence states, ligand coordination, codoping with other elements, particle size, and morphology, are discussed to correlate the structure&#8212;antioxidant performance relationships. Two major biological functions, including regulating immune cell polarization and protecting cells from oxidative damage, are highlighted. Finally, challenges in this field are outlined, and our perspectives on future research are provided. It is expected that this review will provide insights for the further development of advanced Mn&#8208;based antioxidants for biomedical applications.

         <title>B&#8722;B Sites in Molten Boron Oxide are Superior to Cyclic B&#8722;O&#8722;B Sites for Methane Oxidation to Formaldehyde and Carbon Monoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidative dehydrogenation of methane over molten boron oxide involves cyclic B&#8722;O&#8722;B (8&#8208;, 6&#8208; and 4&#8208;membered) and B&#8722;B sites. Our comprehensive mechanistic investigation reveals that B&#8722;B site exhibits the lowest activation barrier toward CH4 to HCHO conversion. Further, QRO and IBO analyses indicate that, at the B&#8722;B site electron transfer originates form &#963;(B&#8722;B) bond, whereas in cyclic B&#8722;O&#8722;B motifs, it arises from oxygen lone pairs within the ring.








ABSTRACT
Boron oxide (B2O3) has recently emerged as a promising metal&#8208;free catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of methane, with remarkable selectivity for formaldehyde (HCHO) and carbon monoxide (CO) at 823 K. Since B2O3 melts at &#8764;725 K, the ODH reaction is likely to proceed in its molten state. In 2023, ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulations by Rousseau and co&#8208;workers revealed that molten B2O3 comprises of 8&#8208;, 6&#8208;, 4&#8208;membered cyclic B&#8722;O&#8722;B sites and a B&#8722;B site. So herein, we carried out a detailed DFT&#8208;based mechanistic investigation for CH4 oxidation across these structural motifs with 1O2 and 3O2. Due to the multireference character of 1O2 and its associated species, CASSCF/NEVPT2 methodology was employed. Among all motifs, the B&#8722;B site exhibits superior catalytic activity toward HCHO formation (36.6&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1), while cyclic B&#8722;O&#8722;B sites require significantly higher activation barriers (&#8764; 50 to 78&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1). Orbital analysis reveals that electron transfer in cyclic B&#8722;O&#8722;B sites originates from oxygen lone&#8208;pair located in the ring, while at the B&#8722;B site, it originates from &#963;(B&#8722;B) bond. In addition, CO formation is thermodynamically more favorable than CO2, consistent with existing experimental observations. Overall, these mechanistic insights offer a foundation for designing efficient, metal&#8208;free methane oxidation catalysts.

         <title>Bicyclic 1,4&#8208;Dioxepanes for Drug&#160;Discovery: Multigram Synthesis, Physicochemical, and Structural Characterization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient approach to the multigram synthesis of fused bicyclic and spirocyclic 1,4&#8208;dioxepanes based on the base&#8208;promoted double alkylation of saturated heterocyclic diols with &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;dichloroisobutylene is developed. Physicochemical and structural characterization of the proposed ring systems through pKa and LogP measurements and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies illustrated their potential for isosteric replacements in medicinal chemistry.








ABSTRACT
Fused and spirocyclic 1,4&#8208;dioxepanes bearing a saturated heterocyclic amine ring are proposed as promising molecular frameworks for early drug discovery. The key step of their synthesis included double alkylation of an appropriate saturated N&#8208;heterocyclic 1,2&#8208;diol with &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;dichloroisobutylene. Further chemical modification of the terminal exocyclic double bond in the resulting bicyclic intermediates provided access to a series of valuable building blocks bearing common functional groups as the synthetic handles. The developed protocols demonstrated high efficiency at multigram scale. The potential of the synthesized bicyclic compounds for isosteric replacements was evaluated by physicochemical and conformational profiling, that is, pKa and LogP measurements, virtual library enumeration, and exit vector analysis based on X&#8208;ray diffraction data.

         <title>Radical Stability Paradox: Substituent Effects versus Heats of Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rethinking molecular stability: Quantum&#8208;chemical analyses show that the greater stability of tertiary over primary organic radicals is not caused by stabilizing substituent effects but by the inherent stability of the substituent.








ABSTRACT
Recently, we have shown that alkyl substituents destabilize the carbon radical center of organic radicals. However, seemingly in contradiction with this earlier finding, the series of isomeric n&#8208;butyl, s&#8208;butyl, and t&#8208;butyl radicals shows an increasingly stable (less positive) heat of formation &#8710;Hf, despite an increasing number of alkyl substituents at the radical center. Herein, we provide a solution to this apparent paradox of contradicting pictures. The crux of the matter is that &#8710;Hf not only comprises the substituent effect on the radical center but also the intrinsic stability of the substituents. Furthermore, we provide a generalizable framework for extracting the actual intrinsic substituent effects from experimental and computational data, an approach with broad applicability to radical chemistry, thermochemistry, and beyond.

         <title>Photoinduced Spirocyclization for the Synthesis of Spirocyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review offers a comprehensive summary on the synthesis of spirocyclic compounds via visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced spirocyclization reactions over the past decade. These reactions are classified into five main categories according to the specific cyclization methods employed.








ABSTRACT
Spirocycles represent an important class of 3D skeletons that are commonly encountered in natural products and pharmaceutical agents. Owing to their remarkable properties and fine&#8208;tuning of conformational and physicochemical characteristics, the synthesis of spirocyclic motifs has been extensively investigated over the past decade. This review provides an overview of the latest developments in visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced spirocyclization for the construction of spirocyclic compounds, with a focus on catalytic methods, substrate scope, and mechanistic aspects. In the conclusion of this review, the limitations and challenges within this field are highlighted, and potential future research directions are also explored.

A donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;donor (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A&#8211;&#960;&#8211;D) fluorophore bearing a U&#8208;shaped dipyridophenazine core forms bifurcated hydrogen bonds with neutral donors such as sulfonamides or water. This interaction modulates both ground and excited states, enabling red&#8208;shifted emission and enhanced photoluminescence in solution and solid state.








ABSTRACT
Modulating photophysical properties via hydrogen bonding offers a powerful strategy for designing supramolecular functional materials and responsive optical systems. Here, we present a U&#8208;shaped dipyridophenazine (DPyPHZ)&#8208;cored donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;donor (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A&#8211;&#960;&#8211;D) scaffold that serves as a hydrogen&#8208;bond receptor capable of forming bifurcated hydrogen bonds, enabling simultaneous modulation of both ground and excited states. We developed an efficient synthetic route to this &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, and demonstrated that its absorption and emission spectra undergo pronounced red&#8208;shifts upon 1:1 complexation with neutral hydrogen&#8208;bond donors such as sulfonamides and even water. Spectroscopic analyses reveal that the hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction stabilizes the charge&#8208;transfer excited state, leading to enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and color modulation. Notably, these optical responses persist in the solid state when embedded in a polymer matrix, enabling emission color switching without fluorophore aggregation. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis confirmed the formation of a well&#8208;defined bifurcated hydrogen&#8208;bonding complex in the solid state. Comparative studies with structural analogues highlight the importance of the electron&#8208;density hotspot in DPyPHZ for selective and directional hydrogen bonding. This work introduces a supramolecular design strategy for precise dual&#8208;state photophysical control, providing a platform for environmentally responsive luminescent materials with potential in sensing, imaging, and optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Novel Bioactive Multifunctional Polyphenols: A Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Approach</title>

One&#8208;step synthesis of complex alkyl oxystilbenin glucosides (6&#8208;47% yield) in alcoholic medium. Switching to ter&#8208;BuOH as solvent afforded &#948;&#8208;Viniferin diglucoside, with high selectivity and high yield (&gt; 90%), that can be upgraded by enzymatic esterification to alkyl &#948;&#8208;Viniferin diglucosides. These new compounds exhibit tunable hydrophilic/lipophilic balance and valuable antioxidant and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties.








ABSTRACT
Stilbenes, such as resveratrol, possess numerous biological activities desirable in various industrial sectors (e.g., pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and cosmetic). However, these activities are counteracted by their low bioavailability. In order to achieve an optimal hydrophylic/lipophilic balance (HLB) and thus maximize bioavailability, alkyl glucoside dimers of resveratrol (i.e., C2 to C12 alkyl oxystilbenin diglucosides (C8&#8208;O4&#8217; linkage) and &#948;&#8208;Viniferin diglucoside (C3&#8208;C8&#8217; linkage)) were synthesized from piceid&#8212;a &#946;&#8208;glucoside of resveratrol&#8212;in one or two steps using a silver acetate&#8208;mediated oxidative coupling in various alcoholic solvents as the key step. &#948;&#8208;Viniferin diglucoside was functionalized by lauric acid using an enzyme&#8208;mediated esterification. HLB values, determined from Log P (the partition coefficient between water and octan&#8208;1&#8208;ol), were calculated for the nine synthesized compounds, revealing that four exhibited values within the range considered favorable for bioabsorption. Finally, antiradical and antioxidant activities were assessed using DPPH and ORAC tests, respectively, prior to anti&#8208;inflammatory testing on dermal human cells. These assays have shown very promising results with some activities overpassing that of resveratrol.

         <title>A Bifunctional Cytochrome P450 Enzyme Catalyzes Hydroxylation and Aryl&#8208;Aryl Ether Formation in the Biosynthesis of Emestrin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conversion of emestrin J (5) to emestrin (1) by three P450 enzymes from the cluster (eme) in Emericella quadrilineata. EmeO acts as a bifunctional enzyme for the construction of the 15&#8208;membered lactone ring via an aryl&#8208;aryl ether bond formation and simultaneous hydroxylation between phenolic and nonphenolic aromatic rings, while EmeE and EmeR install regioselective and stereospecific hydroxyl groups at the &#223;&#8208;positions of the diketopiperazine ring.








ABSTRACT
Emestrins, a subgroup of epipolythiodioxopiperazines, are originated from cyclo&#8208;l&#8208;Phe&#8208;l&#8208;Phe and feature a dihydrooxepine ring. They contain typically a 15&#8208;membered lactone ring with an aryl&#8208;aryl ether linkage. Despite considerable progress in elucidating epipolythiodioxopiperazine biosynthesis, the enzymatic mechanism for the ether bond formation in emestrins remains uncharacterized. We identified a putative gene cluster (eme) in the fungus Emericella quadrilineata with three unknown P450 enzymes, EmeE, EmeR, and EmeO. Gene deletion, feeding experiments, and in vitro assays proved that EmeE and EmeR install regioselective and stereospecific hydroxyl groups at the &#223;&#8208;positions of the diketopiperazine ring. EmeO acts as a bifunctional enzyme for the construction of the lactone ring via an aryl&#8208;aryl ether bond formation and simultaneous hydroxylation between phenolic and nonphenolic aromatic rings. To the best of our knowledge, such enzymatic reactions have not been reported prior to this study.

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Spin&#8208;Labeling of RNA With Short Hairpins Containing the Rigid Spin Label &#199;m</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of sophisticated spectroscopic probes into RNA often requires an extensive synthetic effort. To minimize that, a noncovalent spin&#8208;labeling strategy using spin&#8208;labeled hairpins has been developed. The assembly of hairpins containing the rigid spin label &#199;m with RNA duplexes was monitored by EPR spectroscopy, including PELDOR. Short complementary overhangs facilitated efficient helical stacking.








ABSTRACT
Understanding the structure and dynamics of nucleic acids is essential for elucidating their complex biological functions. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is a valuable technique to extract such information. However, its application to nucleic acids requires the incorporation of spin labels, usually nitroxides. Rigid spin labels are more informative EPR probes than flexible ones, since they offer high&#8208;precision distance measurements and can provide information about the relative orientation of spin labels. However, the synthesis and incorporation of such rigid labels is nontrivial. Here we describe a strategy in which the rigid spin label &#199;m is incorporated into a small hairpin, which in turn can be used to label several different oligonucleotides noncovalently through helical stacking. We have studied the noncovalent assembly of spin&#8208;labeled RNA hairpins with RNA duplexes by both continuous wave (CW) and pulsed dipolar EPR spectroscopy, specifically pulsed electron&#8208;electron double resonance (PELDOR, also called DEER). Our data shows that short complementary overhangs facilitate efficient helical stacking, opening the possibility of using noncovalent labeling with &#199;m&#8208;modified hairpins in conjunction with pulsed dipolar EPR spectroscopy for structural studies of larger RNAs and RNA&#8208;protein complexes.

Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is a valuable technique to extract such information. However, its application to nucleic acids requires the incorporation of spin labels, usually nitroxides. Rigid spin labels are more informative EPR probes than flexible ones, since they offer high-precision distance measurements and can provide information about the relative orientation of spin labels. However, the synthesis and incorporation of such rigid labels is nontrivial. Here we describe a strategy in which the rigid spin label &lt;b&gt;&#199;m&lt;/b&gt; is incorporated into a small hairpin, which in turn can be used to label several different oligonucleotides noncovalently through helical stacking. We have studied the noncovalent assembly of spin-labeled RNA hairpins with RNA duplexes by both continuous wave (CW) and pulsed dipolar EPR spectroscopy, specifically pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR, also called DEER). Our data shows that short complementary overhangs facilitate efficient helical stacking, opening the possibility of using noncovalent labeling with &lt;b&gt;&#199;m&lt;/b&gt;-modified hairpins in conjunction with pulsed dipolar EPR spectroscopy for structural studies of larger RNAs and RNA-protein complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Torsion&#8208;induced &#960;&#8208;conjugation Offers an Approach to Small Coumarin&#8208;based Color&#8208;changing Fluorescent Sensors of Esterase Activity</title>

C4&#8208;coumarin esters enhance the torsional extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation, allowing for a fluorescent color&#8208;based distinction between ester and carboxylate species during esterase&#8208;mediated hydrolysis.








ABSTRACT
Fluorescent sensors for esterase activity include a diverse array of compounds that utilize intramolecular charge transfer induced by the unmasking of the electron&#8208;donating hydroxyl group through esterase action. These sensors exhibit different outcomes, ranging from turn&#8208;on fluorescence to fluorescence color changes. In this work, we demonstrate the application of torsion&#8208;induced fluorescence changes in designing esterase&#8208;dependent chemosensors. We present a method for detecting esterase activity based on the torsion&#8208;induced geometrical changes between the ester and carboxylate forms of a fluorophore. Our approach shows that aligning electronic interactions between the C7 heteroatom and the C4 ester substituents within a small coumarin core stabilizes the planar geometry of the coumarin ester, leading to fluorescence emission above 570&#160;nm. Upon esterase&#8208;mediated hydrolysis, the coumarin exhibits a blue shift in emission to 460&#160;nm, corresponding to the carboxylate form. This shift occurs due to the nonplanar orientation of the carbonyl relative to the fluorophore. As a result, C4&#8208;coumarin ester emissions can be observed in the red fluorescence channel, while carboxylate emissions are detected in the blue/green fluorescence channels. Consequently, we introduce small, highly permeable aryl and acetoxymethyl coumarin esters as indicators of esterase activity and as tools to differentiate between live and dead cells.

         <title>Modulating the Optoelectronic Properties of Tripodal Fluorophores Through Fluorine&#8208;Substituted Peripheral Phenyls</title>

         <dc:description>
C3&#8208;symmetric D&#8208;(&#960;&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A)3 fluorophores featuring central triphenylamine donor, polarizable 2,5&#8208;divinylthiophene linker, and a broad portfolio of fluorine&#8208;based substituents show tunable (non)linear optical properties.








ABSTRACT
Fourteen novel tripodal fluorophores based on a central triphenylamine donor, electron&#8208;rich, and polarizable divinylthiophene linker, and eight different fluorine&#8208;based substituents have been designed and prepared via a straightforward four&#8208;step sequence. Altering the peripheral F&#8208;substitution has been demonstrated to largely affect their fundamental properties such as thermal robustness (210&#8211;420 &#176;C), the LUMO energies (ELUMO = &#8722;2.35 to &#8722;3.11&#160;eV), the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap (&#916;E = 2.07&#8211;2.66&#160;eV), and the absorption/emission maxima (&#955;maxA/E = 442&#8211;478/521&#8211;678&#160;nm). The experimental data, corroborated by DFT calculations, further revealed twofold and tunable ICT employing both central triphenylamine and auxiliary thiophene donors, and the peripheral F&#8208;substitution either boosting or switching&#8208;off two&#8208;photon absorption activity. Whereas the &#9472;SF5 groups impart an exceptional cross&#8208;section of 1930 GM, the &#9472;COCF3 group may completely suppress the nonlinear optical response.

         <title>Systematic Comparison of Homogeneous Catalyst Recycling Strategies: Organic Solvent Nanofiltration vs. Liquid&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Multiphase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Key performance metrics, including hexene conversion rates and catalyst leaching, were evaluated over extended continuous operation periods. Results demonstrated that the OSN method significantly outperformed the multiphasic system, maintaining hexene conversion at 83% after 76 h compared to a decline to 72% in the multiphasic setup after 36 h. Furthermore, catalyst leaching was substantially lower in the OSN system, at below 0.1&#160;ppm during continuous operation an order of magnitude less than the competing multiphasic approach.








ABSTRACT
This study presents a systematic comparison of two recycling strategies for molecular catalyst&#8212;multiphasic catalyst recycling and organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN)&#8212;within a unified reaction system. Molecular catalyzed reactions are vital in chemical production, necessitating efficient recycling of costly catalyst metals. To facilitate a fair comparison, a versatile model reaction system was developed that allows for both monophasic and multiphasic configurations while preserving the integrity of the central hydroformylation process, converting 1&#8208;hexene and CO/H2 syngas to heptanal in both cases.

         <title>Construction of Phospholipid&#8208;Like Vesicles by Aqueous Aminolysis of Acyl Thioesters With Diamino Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Membrane&#8208;forming phospholipids are produced in cells via enzymatic diacylation. Here, we show that direct aminolysis of acyl thioesters with diamino acids in aqueous environments enables the synthesis of diacylated amino acids (DAAAs), which spontaneously self&#8208;assemble into robust phospholipid&#8208;like vesicles across a broad range of pH and temperature.








ABSTRACT
Membrane&#8208;forming phospholipids are produced in cells by enzymatic diacylation of polar head groups. However, analogous nonenzymatic processes remain both challenging and limited in scope. Moreover, the restricted variety of canonical lipid head groups constrains the properties and functions of phospholipid membranes. Therefore, the development of chemical methodologies for the straightforward preparation of versatile membrane&#8208;forming building blocks is highly valuable. Here, we describe a simple strategy for the aqueous synthesis of phospholipid&#8208;like molecules via direct aminolysis between diamino acids and water&#8208;soluble acyl thioesters. In the presence of imidazole, diamino acids (i.e., diaminopropionic acid, ornithine, lysine) undergo rapid N&#8208;diacylation to yield amphiphilic diacylated amino acids (DAAAs). These amino acid&#8208;lipid conjugates spontaneously self&#8208;assemble into robust micron&#8208;sized vesicular structures capable of encapsulating hydrophilic cargos across a wide pH and temperature range. Our findings highlight the potential of amino acid&#8208;based lipids as modular, functional building blocks for generating tunable membranous systems in aqueous environments.

         <title>Development of tCAP(N3): Affinity Peptide&#8208;Aided, pH&#8208;Triggered Strategy for Site&#8208;Specific Native IgG Modification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tCAP(N3) reagent, featuring a stable and self&#8208;activating precursor, enables site&#8208;specific conjugation of native IgGs. This Fc&#8208;affinity peptide approach selectively transfers an Ac&#8208;Lys(N3)&#8208;Gly&#8208;Gly payload to Lys248, producing divalently azidated antibody while preserving its biological function. The incorporated azide groups serve as handles for efficient click chemistry with DBCO&#8208;functionalized payloads, yielding well&#8208;defined ADCs.








ABSTRACT
Direct modification of native antibodies with affinity peptides remains a significant challenge, primarily because the affinity peptide often stays bound to the antibody and blocks its interaction with key receptors. In this study, we developed tCAP(N3), a novel traceless chemical conjugation method that employs an affinity peptide. tCAP(N3) can be stored for over a year at refrigerated temperature, as it contains an active ester precursor that can be spontaneously activated under neutral conditions. When tCAP(N3) was mixed with a target native IgG, Ac&#8208;Lys(N3)&#8208;Gly&#8208;Gly was site&#8208;selectively transferred onto Lys248, yielding divalently azidated IgG that can be further modified with DBCO compounds. The resulting antibody conjugates retained Fc receptor binding and antigen recognition comparable to the parent IgG.

This Fc-affinity peptide approach selectively transfers an Ac-Lys(N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)-Gly-Gly payload to Lys248, producing divalently azidated antibody while preserving its biological function. The incorporated azide groups serve as handles for efficient click chemistry with DBCO-functionalized payloads, yielding well-defined ADCs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct modification of native antibodies with affinity peptides remains a significant challenge, primarily because the affinity peptide often stays bound to the antibody and blocks its interaction with key receptors. In this study, we developed tCAP(N3), a novel traceless chemical conjugation method that employs an affinity peptide. tCAP(N3) can be stored for over a year at refrigerated temperature, as it contains an active ester precursor that can be spontaneously activated under neutral conditions. When tCAP(N3) was mixed with a target native IgG, Ac-Lys(N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)-Gly-Gly was site-selectively transferred onto Lys248, yielding divalently azidated IgG that can be further modified with DBCO compounds. The resulting antibody conjugates retained Fc receptor binding and antigen recognition comparable to the parent IgG.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Based on Formate Decomposition With Bio/Metal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen evolution from formate with a hybrid system of enzyme, donor&#8208;acceptor linked photocatalyst&#8208;cyclodextrin complex (Mes&#8208;Acr+&#8208;CD) and platinum nanoparticle is reported. The use of CD as a dispersant for Mes&#8208;Acr+ is a perfect strategy to enhance photocatalytic activity in aqueous solution without deactivation of the enzyme. This work also reveals that ring size and substituents of CD could influence hydrogen production in the system significantly.








ABSTRACT
Formic acid is an attractive hydrogen carrier in terms of hydrogen capacity and safety. Focusing on hydrogen release from formic acid, the developments of catalysts with easy controllability in mild conditions have been desirable. Previous study reported a hybrid catalytic system of enzymes, photosensitizers, and metal nanoparticles for controllable hydrogen production with visible light. However, methyl viologen, which is a toxic compound, was utilized as an electron mediator from photosensitizers to metal nanoparticles. 9&#8208;Mesityl&#8208;10&#8208;methyl acridinium (Mes&#8208;Acr+) is one of the promising candidates which hold a long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state for the removal of methyl viologen from the hybrid system to enhance the safety and the catalytic activity. In this work, cyclodextrins (CDs) were employed to form a complex with Mes&#8208;Acr+ using supramolecular interactions such as ionic and hydrophobic interactions, which improved photocatalytic activity in aqueous solution. This supramolecular photocatalyst was finally applied to photocatalytic hydrogen production with a system of formate dehydrogenase, NAD+, Mes&#8208;Acr+, CD, and colloidal platinum nanoparticles dispersed by polyvinylpyrrolidone. An ultimate yield from formate to hydrogen reached 24% at pH 6.0, indicating a rate&#8208;determining step would be electron transfer from Mes&#8208;Acr radical to Pt&#8208;PVP to reduce protons.

         <title>Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Coupled to Formate Fermentation: An Electro&#8208;Bio Cascade Approach in Biocompatible Electrolytes</title>

CO2 utilization in industrial biotechnology: Rational design of a process cascade for electrochemical CO2 reduction linked with formate fermentation, supporting robust cell growth and high biomass yields.








ABSTRACT
Integration of electrochemical CO2 reduction with microbial fermentation enables conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals but poses challenges at the electrolysis&#8208;fermentation interface. The electrolyte must ensure efficient CO2 reduction while remaining compatible with microbial growth. We investigated various electrolytes for coupling CO2 electroreduction to formate with formate fermentation by Methylorubrum&#160;extorquens TK&#160;0001. Electrolyte performance was evaluated by formate production and microbial growth. A phosphate&#8208;based buffer demonstrated the best overall compatibility. Optimal microbial growth occurred at 0.1&#160;mol L&#8722;1 KPi, with tolerance of up to 111&#160;mmol L&#8722;1 formate. Continuous CO2 electrolysis in 1.0&#160;mol L&#8722;1 KPi produced 2.0&#160;mol L&#8722;1 formate in 48 h. Formate fermentation with M.&#160;extorquens showed biomass yield of 107&#160;mg CDW gformate&#8722;1 and a growth rate of 0.10 h&#8722;1. These results highlight the crucial role of buffer composition and concentration in balancing efficient CO2 electroreduction with stable fermentation. Optimizing this electrochemical&#8211;biological interface enables direct utilization of CO2&#8208;derived formate as a substrate for sustainable microbial production, offering a promising scalable route for industrial biotechnology.

         <title>Fluorescent Diarylethenes With Polar Groups: Synthesis, Spectra, and Optical Microscopy Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Blinking green and flashing red: photo&#8208;switchable and photo&#8208;activatable probes emitting green and red light were prepared and applied as bioconjugates in super&#8208;resolution optical microscopy.








ABSTRACT
The use of photoactivatable fluorescent diarylethenes (fDAEs) in biology&#8208;related light microscopy has been restricted by the lack of probes having freely variable structural and spectral properties. Facing these challenges, we synthesized &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; fDAEs with four hydroxyl groups and a single functionality in the core structure (HO&#8208;fDAEs). HO&#8208;fDAEs emit green light; they were used for the preparation of cell&#8208;permeant mitochondrion&#8208;selective probes and bioconjugation with proteins (via a single COOH group). HO&#8208;fDAEs were combined in bio&#8208;imaging with a thiophene&#8208;substituted fDAE (Th&#8208;fDAE) possessing red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission bands of the open&#8208; and closed&#8208;ring isomers. Th&#8208;fDAE undergoes full on&#8208;switching with 405&#160;nm and excitation with green light (&lt; 560&#160;nm). The large Stokes shifts of HO&#8208;and Th&#8208;fDAE (80 and 110&#160;nm, respectively) and different excitation wavelengths permitted color separation in optical microscopy. Photoactivation of HO&#8208;fDAEs and transient on&#8208;off switching (blinking) of Th&#8208;fDAE made it possible to acquire two&#8208;color images of cellular structures with optical superresolution.

         <title>How Do Charge States Affect Ammonia Coordination in Superatomic Niobium Clusters?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals how cluster charge states regulate ammonia coordination on superatomic niobium clusters, illustrating a superatom&#8208;&#963; coordination mechanism.








ABSTRACT
Atomically precise metal clusters have garnered significant research attention owing to their distinctive properties, which make them promising for advanced materials and catalytic applications. A fundamental understanding of metal cluster&#8208;ligand interactions is crucial for developing efficient cluster&#8208;based catalysts and functional materials. In this study, we show that Nbn+ and Nbn&#8722; clusters exhibit charge&#8208;dependent reactivity with NH3, resulting in prominent coordination products including Nb7(NH3)7+, Nb7(NH3)2&#8722;, Nb8(NH3)8+, and Nb8(NH3)4&#8722;. Using DFT calculations, we uncovered the critical role of cluster charge states and Lewis&#8208;acid sites in determining reactivity and the formation of complex products. Furthermore, we elucidated the superatom&#8208;&#963; coordination mode and the stability mechanism of these complexes. This study offers new insights into coordination chemistry and provides a foundation for rational design of new materials via metal cluster complexes.

         <title>Dearomative Vinylation of Indoles via Multicomponent Photoredox Thiol&#8208;Yne&#8208;Heteroarene Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









ABSTRACT
Dearomative addition reactions of indoles represent a prominent strategy for the synthesis of practically valuable indolines. However, implementing this approach typically requires prefunctionalization of the indole precursor with specific groups (e.g., alkynes, alkenes, or ketones) to facilitate the subsequent cyclization&#8208;dearomatization step. In this work, we report a three&#8208;component, thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;mediated dearomative vinylation of indoles that circumvents the need for preinstalling reactive fragments into the indole scaffold. The developed photoredox&#8208;catalyzed thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;heteroarene reaction employs Boc&#8208;protected indole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates as effective terminating agents for the radical cascade.

         <title>Asynchronous Reaction Toward Hierarchical Crosslinking Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical crosslinking network structures through asynchronous reactions based on the difference in reactivity of functional groups enable the realization of topologically customizable polyurea ionogels. This Concept explores the impact of network structure on the mechanical properties, hysteresis, and multifunctionality of polymer ionogels, offering a pathway for advanced flexible iontronic applications.








ABSTRACT
Ionogels have emerged as promising materials in soft iontronics, with their network structure playing a pivotal role in determining performance and enabling diverse applications. Refining the network architectures of ionogels through chemical design is a promising strategy. This Concept article summarizes our recent progress in the design of polymeric ionogel networks. Our methodology exploits the pronounced disparity in chemical reactivity among functional groups, thereby achieving the spontaneous formation of these hyperbranched clusters through asynchronous reactions. These hyperbranched clusters spontaneously assemble via hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, thereby constructing hierarchical cross&#8208;linked polymer networks. This network design endows polyurea ionogels with high strength, exceptional toughness, low hysteresis, and fluorescence. We have summarized the applications of such ionogels in emerging fields, including flexible sensing, electroluminescent devices, and nanogenerators. Finally, the application prospects and future development directions of these materials are discussed. This network design strategy is expected to provide new insights for developing functionalized ionogels.

         <title>Cu(I) Is a Game Changer in the Arrest of Cu(A&#946;)&#8208;Induced ROS Production in the Presence of Competing Zn(II) Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









ABSTRACT
ROS production due to Cu(amyloid&#8208;&#946;) redox cycling is proposed to contribute to the oxidative stress observed in Alzheimer's disease brains. We previously reported on a nitrogen and sulfur&#8208;containing ligand, L, able to arrest Cu(A&#946;)&#8208;induced ROS production [Chem. Eur. J. 2023, 29,]. In the present study, the intricate mechanism by which L maintains its protective activity in the presence of Zn, an abundant endogenous metal ion found in the synaptic cleft, is disentangled with the use of complementary spectroscopic and analytical investigations. This mechanism, which we refer to as kinetic Cu(I) shunt, relies on a faster Cu(I) than Zn transfer from Cu,Zn(A&#946;) to L, followed by a fast re&#8208;oxidation of Cu(I)(L) to Cu(II)(L), which is redox&#8208;inert (i.e. resistant against reduction from ascorbate). This study hence provides new insights into the kinetic involvement of Cu(I) ions in the inhibition of Cu(A&#946;)&#8208;associated ROS production in presence of Zn.

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Au(I)&#8208;Aryl Complexes Through Mild Base&#8208;Assisted Transmetallation of Arylboronic Acids: Scope and Limitations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic method based on the use of aqueous ammonia&#8208;assisted transmetallation permits access to various [Au(I)(NHC)(Aryl)] complexes using mild reagents, desirable solvents and ambient reaction conditions.








ABSTRACT
A resurgence of research surrounding Au(I)&#8208;Aryl complexes has led to sustainable methods toward their synthesis, as well as to the expansion of their scope and applications in catalysis, biology, and materials chemistry. The availability of mild synthetic methodologies has facilitated the design and development of Au(I)&#8208;Aryl architectures suitable for specific photonic applications, such as Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) and Room Temperature Phosphorescence (RTP) emitters. The development and application of reliable synthetic methods have increased, yet several synthetic aspects remain to be uncovered. Herein, the synthesis of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) Au(I)&#8208;Aryl complexes through mild, base&#8208;assisted transmetallation of arylboronic acids is further explored, targeting Au(I)&#8208;Aryl structures incorporating polyaromatic and triarylborane frameworks, and structural features of relevance to organometallic synthesis, supramolecular chemistry, and luminescence. In addition to the utilization of K2CO3 as the mild, cost&#8208;effective base of choice, we introduce the use of aqueous ammonia as a novel tool that facilitates transmetallation to gold. The purpose of additional exploration is to discover limitations of the synthetic methods, as well as inherent flaws regarding the design of [Au(NHC)(Ar)] (Ar = Aryl) complexes. Previously undiscovered synthetic limitations are disclosed, along with practical alternatives.

         <title>Hierarchical Manganese&#8208;Doped ZIFs Heterostructure Electrocatalysts for Highly&#8208;Efficient Methanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Mn&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67/ZIF&#8208;L heterostructure undergoes in situ electrochemical reconstruction into a highly active (Co, Mn)OOH phase, providing abundant catalytic sites and fast charge transfer. The reconstructed catalyst enables efficient methanol oxidation with superior durability while simultaneously achieving energy&#8208;saving hydrogen co&#8208;production.








ABSTRACT
The development of cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) is essential to promote the hydrogen energy technology. However, most of the electrocatalysts currently used for MOR have drawbacks, such as inefficient reaction kinetics, low tolerance to carbon monoxide poisoning, and unstable performance. Herein, we report a novel hierarchical MOF heterostructure that is made up of Mn&#8208;doped ZIF67 and Mn&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;L (Mn&#8208;ZIF67/L) directly grown on carbon cloth to highly enhance the MOR performance. Such heterostructure integrates flake&#8208;like Mn&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;L with Mn&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67 nanocrystals, forming a porous core&#8208;shell framework with abundant active sites and enhanced charge transportation. More interesting, the Mn&#8208;ZIF67/L experiences dynamic reconstruction (Mn&#8208;ZIF67/L&#8208;ac) that partial phases in CoMn LDHs are transformed into (Co,Mn)OOH during the electrochemical operation in which further boosting the catalytic performance and stability. The electrochemical results demonstrate that Mn&#8208;ZIF67/L&#8208;ac remarkably improves the MOR performance with the much lower potential of 1.359&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming commercial RuO2. The electrocatalyst also delivers the high MOR stability of &#8764;97% retention after 130&#160;h. This work demonstrates a robust strategy for nonnoble&#8208;metal electrocatalysts and an efficient route to hydrogen production through MOR&#8208;HER coupling.

         <dc:description>
Synopsis: This review systematically summarizes the design strategies, reaction mechanisms, and application prospects of OSEs, highlighting their potential for sustainable energy conversion and as alternatives to noble metal catalysts.








ABSTRACT
Organic semiconductor electrocatalysts (OSEs), which integrate the properties of organic semiconductors with electrocatalytic performance, have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional noble metal catalysts due to their low cost, earth abundance, and design flexibility. This article reviews the unique structural features of organic material systems, including small organic molecules, conjugated polymers, covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and organic hybrid materials. It elucidates the structure&#8208;activity relationship between the features of organic catalysts and their catalytic advantages. It discusses design strategies, including molecular engineering and interface regulation. Also, it explores applications in key reactions, including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Despite challenges in stability and large&#8208;scale preparation, OSEs show great potential in sustainable energy conversion, offering insights for advancing clean energy technologies.

Conceptual illustration of surface activation and reversible regeneration in H2SO4&#8208;treated Ni foam. Sulfuric&#8208;acid treatment introduces surface &#946;&#8208;NiOOH active sites while embedding a subsurface &#946;/&#947;&#8208;NiOOH reservoir. During electrochemical cycling, this buried phase acts as a structural memory that enables reversible reconstruction of the active &#946;&#8208;NiOOH layer, ensuring sustained oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and durability.








ABSTRACT
Designing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts that can reversibly operate as both oxidation and reduction electrodes is key to developing efficient and rechargeable electrochemical energy systems. However, the evolution of nickel active sites between hydroxide and oxyhydroxide phases, and how such transformations can be made reversible under dynamic operating conditions, remains poorly understood. Here, we report a sulfuric&#8208;acid&#8208;induced surface oxidation strategy that enables both the controlled formation and reversible regeneration of &#946;&#8208;NiOOH active sites on free&#8208;standing nickel foam electrodes. Moderate H2SO4 treatment (1&#160;M) produces an optimized electrode (1.0&#8208;Ni) exhibiting superior OER performance, requiring overpotentials (&#951;) of only 218, 348, and 458&#160;mV at 10, 500, and 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. The enhanced activity originates from sulfuric&#8208;acid&#8208;induced modulation of Ni sites, which promotes &#946;&#8208;NiOOH formation as the catalytically active phase while maintaining structural integrity. Moreover, a buried &#946;&#8208;NiOOH&#8208;rich layer serves as a structural&#8208;memory reservoir, allowing reversible reconstruction of surface &#946;&#8208;NiOOH during redox cycling. This reversible behavior enables the same electrode to function as both anode and cathode, relevant to rechargeable zinc&#8211;air battery and other bifunctional electrochemical systems. The dual mechanism acid&#8208;induced active&#8208;site formation and electrochemical regeneration thus provides a scalable strategy for constructing reversible, heteroatom&#8208;free nickel electrodes for sustainable energy conversion.
