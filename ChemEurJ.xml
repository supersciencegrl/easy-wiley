         <title>Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Multi&#8208;Carbon Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 53, September 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent progress in photocatalytic CO2 reduction toward multi&#8208;carbon products, emphasizing key advances in catalyst design. Strategies including atomic site dispersion, co&#8208;catalyst integration, defect engineering, and utilization of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) are discussed to promote C&#8211;C coupling, offering insights into selective solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion.








Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction represents a sustainable pathway for mitigating carbon emissions and producing renewable chemicals by utilizing solar energy. While extensive research has been dedicated to single&#8208;carbon (C1) products, the selective formation of multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) compounds, such as ethylene, ethane, ethanol and acetic acid, has garnered increasing attention due to their higher energy density and broader industrial relevance. However, achieving efficient C&#9472;C coupling under mild photocatalytic conditions remains a formidable challenge, hindered by complex reaction pathways, sluggish kinetics and competitive side reactions. In this review, recent advances in photocatalytic CO2 reduction to C2+ products was systematically summarized, focusing on fundamental reaction mechanisms, rational photocatalyst design strategies, including atomically dispersed active sites, cocatalyst loading, defect engineering, and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). By bridging mechanistic understanding with materials innovation, this review provides a comprehensive framework for guiding the development of next&#8208;generation photocatalytic systems for efficient and selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion, contributing to sustainable carbon utilization and circular chemical economy.

         <title>Interfacial Co&#8208;Operativity Enables Ultrafast Charge Transfer Within the Co&#8208;Fe Prussian Blue Analogue|Zno Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 53, September 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This combined spectroscopic study shows that when the interfacial composition of PBA|ZnO heterostructure is engineered via a facile synthetic protocol the interfacial CT is promoted by a cooperative mechanism. In this mechanism, pre&#8208;existing oxidized PBA units at the interface facilitate structural rearrangements within the coordination network, thereby lowering the kinetic barrier of the process and improving its water oxidation efficiency.








Abstract
Heterostructures of Cobalt&#8208;Iron (Co&#8208;Fe) Prussian blue analogues (PBA) and inorganic semiconductors are attractive materials for photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical water oxidation. Their efficiency is rooted in the charge transfer (CT) at the PBA|semiconductor interface. The interfacial CT, however, often suffers from sluggish kinetics, optimization of which has been elusive. In this work, we investigate PBA|ZnO heterostructures spectroscopically and show that tuning the interfacial composition of the heterostructure presents a synthetic handle to significantly improve interfacial CT. We employ ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy to probe the CT kinetics, while interface&#8208;sensitive vibrational spectroscopy, that is, time&#8208;resolved and in&#8208;situ vibrational sum&#8208;frequency generation (VSFG), sheds light on the molecular response to the CT across the interface. These measurements reveal that cooperative intermolecular interactions at the PBA|ZnO interface are key to achieving efficient CT. Furthermore, we relate the CT observed on ps&#8208;timescales to the functional properties of the PBA|ZnO heterostructure in terms of photocatalytic water oxidation, which increases by about 200% in absolute yield as compared to a heterostructure without interfacial co&#8208;operativity. Thus, this work presents for the first time a molecular picture of a PBA|ZnO interface and offers a novel perspective to optimize the CT dynamics in PBA|semiconductor heterostructures by tuning the interfacial chemical structure of PBA.

         <title>Circular Dichroism and Multiphoton Circularly Polarized Luminescence Switching Using a Bis&#8208;perylene Diimide Macrocycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 53, September 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral and configurationally stable bis&#8208;perylene diimide macrocycle is reported, which exhibits switchable circular dichroism (CD) and multiphoton circularly polarized luminescence (MP&#8208;CPL). This behavior is realized due to the macrocycle's tuneable chiral conformation, which impacts the intrinsic and supramolecular helicity of the perylene diimide dimer.








Abstract
Chiroptical switches exhibit stimuli&#8208;induced changes in the sign or strength of their circular dichroism (CD) or circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and are materials with significant potential for chiroptical sensing and biological imaging. However, the chromophores used in chiroptical materials usually require excitation by ultraviolet or visible light, which results in higher cytotoxicity and lower penetration compared to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photoexcitation. This can be overcome by multiphoton excitation, yet multiphoton CPL (MP&#8208;CPL) has been challenging to measure in organic emitters. Core&#8208;twisted perylene diimides (PDIs) are excellent chromophores with which to develop MP&#8208;CPL emitters due to a chiral &#960;&#8208;system capable of two&#8208;photon absorption. Furthermore, the integration of these chiral PDIs into stimuli&#8208;responsive macrocycles affords configurational stability and the potential for chiroptical switching, due to the chromophore's tuneable chiral conformation. In this work we report a chiral bis&#8208;PDI macrocycle with stable, yet conformationally dynamic, enantiomers, and in doing so realize a novel chiroptical material that combines switchable CD and MP&#8208;CPL for the first time.

Click chemistry promises a simple method to produce pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;c][1,4]benzodiazepine (PBD)&#8208;based DNA binders. DNA binding and covalent crosslinking capabilities have been validated for &#8216;clicked&#8217; PBD heterodimers using thermal denaturation analysis, mass spectrometry and DNase I footprinting. One dimer induced strong DNA cross&#8208;linking and cellular cytotoxicity, indicating the future potential for dimerization in living cells.








Abstract
The covalent cross&#8208;linking of DNA duplex strands by small molecule drugs is a validated mechanism in anticancer therapy. The pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;c][1,4]benzodiazepines (PBDs) have been established as potent DNA binders that can achieve inter&#8208; and intrastrand DNA cross&#8208;links when dimerized, and have been used as cytotoxic payloads in multiple antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs). In this study, we explore the potential of click chemistry to obtain PBD heterodimers. The heterodimers D1&#8211;D4 were prepared by copper catalyzed or strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloadditions (SPAACs) from the corresponding monomers M1 &#8211; M4 and MbA. The interactions of monomers and dimers with DNA were evaluated by DNA thermal denaturation analysis, a newly developed mass spectrometry&#8208;based method for the detection of single stand and double strand modifications, and by DNase I footprinting. All methods demonstrated the DNA binding and cross&#8208;linking capabilities of D1. Testing for cytotoxicity in three cell lines revealed that the monomers M1 and M4 and the dimers D1 and D4 were the most potent. The click chemistry approach opens an easy access to larger libraries of PBD&#8208;based DNA binders, including the option for dimerization in live cells.

The impact of purine, 7&#8208;deazapurine and 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazapurine heterocyclic skeletons on the stability of the xanthine&#8208;2&#8208;aminoadenine base pair is reported. In view of stability and pH dependence, the 7&#8208;deazaxanthine &#8211; 2&#8208;amino&#8208;8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine pair is superior to other combinations.

Abstract
The impact of purine, 7&#8208;deazapurine and 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazapurine heterocyclic skeletons on the stability of the xanthine&#8208;2&#8208;aminoadenine base pair is reported. Beyond that, base&#8208;pairing of xanthine nucleosides opposite canonical nucleobases is studied. To this end, a building block of 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyxanthosine was prepared using 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyguanosine as starting material. A simplified synthesis for large&#8208;scale production is presented for the phosphoramidite of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;7&#8208;bromo&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (2&#8208;NH2Br7c7z8Ad). Hybridization of oligonucleotides gave duplexes containing single or multiple incorporations of xanthine&#8208;2&#8208;aminoadenine base pairs with different combinations of nucleobases. From melting curves and Tm values, it became apparent that the most stable duplexes contained base pairs of 2&#8208;NH2Br7c7z8Ad with xanthine nucleosides. Under these, the 7&#8208;deazaxanthine&#8208;2&#8208;NH2Br7c7z8Ad base pair reached the stability of dT&#8208;2&#8208;NH2Br7c7z8Ad and dG&#8208;dC pairs. 7&#8208;Deazaxanthine located opposite 2&#8208;aminoadenine residues resulted in higher duplex stability compared to xanthine or 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazaxanthine. For 2&#8208;aminoadenine residues, the base pair stability followed the order 2&#8208;amino&#8208;8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;bromo&#8208;7&#8208;deazaadenine&#160;&gt;&#160;2&#8208;aminoadenine&#160;&gt;&#160;7&#8208;deazaadenine. The impact of pK values became obvious from the increased stability of xanthine&#8208;2&#8208;aminoadenine pairs by decreasing the pH. Single incorporations of xanthine residues opposite canonical nucleobases displayed inhomogeneous pairing properties. Tracts of three xanthine residues in front of adenine and guanine furnished stable duplexes, whereas with cytosine and thymine, duplex formation was hindered.

         <title>Substrate Epoxidation Catalyzed by the Nonheme Iron Dioxygenase Dapdiamide Biosynthesis Enzyme C. Why Is the Substrate Tethered?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 53, September 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work a computational study shows the differences in binding and catalysis of a nonheme iron oxygenase with tethered versus nontethered substrate. The tethered substrate is positioned in an ideal orientation near the active site, while the nontethered substrate shows more dynamics and is not positioned well for double bond epoxidation.









Abstract
Enzymes usually react with a free substrate, although some examples have appeared in the literature of enzymes that utilize a substrate tethered to a protein carrier. However, it is not clear what advantage the tethering has, and therefore a computational study was performed. In particular, we report here the first computational study on the nonheme iron dioxygenase involved in the epoxidation reaction during the dapdiamide biosynthesis (DdaC) and investigate tethered and nontethered substrates. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations show that the protein carrier applies pressure onto the surface of the protein and influences the fold and active site description and leads to differences in substrate&#8208;oxidant interactions. Quantum chemical calculations give much lower epoxidation barriers for the activation of the tethered substrate by 7&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1 over the nontethered substrate and highlight the advantage of a tethered substrate in catalysis.

This study presents the synthesis, physical characterization, and transport as well as electrochemical properties of a novel class of ten ionic liquids (ILs). The ILs are created with two biomass derived anions such as furan&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate [FuA] and tetrahydrofuran&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate [HFuA] coupled to a range of nitrogen heterocyclic cations, for which the nature of cation controlled their transport and electrochemical properties. 








Abstract
Here we present the synthesis, physical characterization, and transport as well as electrochemical properties of a novel class of ten ionic liquids (ILs) derived from biomass. Two biomass derived anions such as furan&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate [FuA] and tetrahydrofuran&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate [HFuA] are coupled to a range of nitrogen heterocyclic cations to create the ILs, for which the nature of cation controlled their properties. For instance, the thermal decomposition temperature ranges from 183 to 259&#160;&#176;C, the glass transition temperature from&#160;&#8722;&#160;47 to&#160;&#8722;&#160;70&#160;&#176;C, and the ionic conductivity from 0.002 to 1.4 mS cm&#8722;1 at 20&#160;&#176;C. The supercapacitors prepared using [EPy][FuA] and [EMPip][FuA] exhibited specific capacitances of 99 F g&#8722;1 and 70 F g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1, respectively. The [EPy][FuA]&#8208;based supercapacitor achieved an energy density of 56&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 as well as a power density of 410&#160;W kg&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1, while the [EMPip][FuA]&#8208;based supercapacitor achieved an energy density of 36&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and a power density of 360&#160;W kg&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1. In addition, the supercapacitors retained 98% and 94% of their initial capacitances after 6000 cycles, for [EPy][FuA] and [EMPip][FuA] electrolytes, respectively.

         <title>Nucleoside Reactions Shed Light on the Chemical Processes Underlying Interstrand Cross&#8208;Link Formation at Apurinic/Apyrimidinic Sites in Duplex DNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 53, September 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites in DNA can give rise to interstrand cross&#8208;links via reactions of the ring&#8208;opened AP&#8208;aldehyde residue with the exocyclic amino groups of 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine, 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyguanosine, and 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxycytosine residues (dA, dG, and dC) on the opposing strand to give imine/N&#8208;glycosylamine linkages. Endogenous AP&#8208;derived cross&#8208;links in cellular DNA could contribute to cancer, aging, and neurodegeneration. The yields of AP&#8208;derived cross&#8208;links produced by the various nucleobases vary widely, and, until now, it remained unclear whether these differences might simply reflect differences in the inherent reactivities of the nucleobases. To shed light on this question, we examined reactions of a nucleosidic AP model compound, 3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribofuranose (1), with the canonical nucleosides (dA, dG, and dC) and the noncanonical nucleoside, 2&#8208;aminopurine&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyriboside (2AP). The trends observed for the equilibrium yields of the nucleoside cross&#8208;links did not mirror yields of the respective cross&#8208;links observed in the context of duplex DNA. The results provide evidence that the inherent reactivity of the nucleobases alone does not determine yields of AP&#8208;derived cross&#8208;links in duplex DNA.

     alt="Nucleoside Reactions Shed Light on the Chemical Processes Underlying Interstrand Cross-Link Formation at Apurinic/Apyrimidinic Sites in Duplex DNA"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites in DNA can give rise to interstrand cross-links via reactions of the ring-opened AP-aldehyde residue with the exocyclic amino groups of 2&#8242;-deoxyadenosine, 2&#8242;-deoxyguanosine, and 2&#8242;-deoxycytosine residues (dA, dG, and dC) on the opposing strand to give imine/&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-glycosylamine linkages. Endogenous AP-derived cross-links in cellular DNA could contribute to cancer, aging, and neurodegeneration. The yields of AP-derived cross-links produced by the various nucleobases vary widely, and, until now, it remained unclear whether these differences might simply reflect differences in the inherent reactivities of the nucleobases. To shed light on this question, we examined reactions of a nucleosidic AP model compound, 3,5-bis-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methyl-2-deoxy-D-ribofuranose (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), with the canonical nucleosides (dA, dG, and dC) and the noncanonical nucleoside, 2-aminopurine-2&#8242;-deoxyriboside (2AP). The trends observed for the equilibrium yields of the nucleoside cross-links did not mirror yields of the respective cross-links observed in the context of duplex DNA. The results provide evidence that the inherent reactivity of the nucleobases alone does not determine yields of AP-derived cross-links in duplex DNA. Rather, the differences in yields for the various AP-derived cross-links must reflect effects exerted by the 3D structure of double helical DNA on the cross-linking processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A 19F&#8208;ATCUN Peptide NMR Probe for Selective Cu2+ or Ni2+ Sensing in Complex Biological Media</title>

We report the design and synthesis of ratiometric 19F&#8208;ATCUN (Xxx&#8208;Zzz&#8208;His) peptide probes for the selective and reversible detection of Ni2&#8314; and Cu2&#8314; by 19F NMR spectroscopy. In contrast to fluorescence&#8208;based approaches, 19F NMR enables background&#8208;free detection in biological media, due to the absence of fluorine in native biomolecules. The probes remain stable and functional in complex cell media (DMEM), enabling the detection of Cu2&#8314; and Ni2&#8314; by 19F NMR with a limit of detection (LOD) of 4&#160;&#181;M and quantification (LOQ) of 10&#160;&#181;M, relevant for studying copper&#8208;related pathologies.

         <title>Synthesis of Anthraquinone Mono&#8208; and Diboron Complexes with Near&#8208;Infrared Panchromatic Absorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 53, September 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anthraquinone boron complexes bearing &#946;&#8208;iminoenolate ligand(s) exhibit strongly substituent&#8208;dependent absorption properties. Unsubstituted monoboron and diboron complexes show sharp UV&#8211;Vis&#8211;NIR absorption spectra resulting from increased molecular rigidity induced by boron coordination. In contrast, dimethylamino&#8208;substituted complexes display near&#8208;infrared (NIR) panchromatic absorption, attributed to enhanced intramolecular charge transfer and multiple electronic transitions.








Abstract
Anthraquinone monoboron complexes 3 and 4, possessing a donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) structure, and diboron complexes 7 and 8, featuring a donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) structure, were readily synthesized in two steps from commercially available reagents. These boron complexes adopt a &#946;&#8208;iminoenolate structure and their absorption properties are markedly affected by the type of the substituent groups. The unsubstituted monoboron complex 3 (fwhm&#160;=&#160;3,950 cm&#8722;1) and diboron complex 7 (fwhm&#160;=&#160;2,510 cm&#8722;1) exhibited sharp UV&#8211;Vis&#8211;NIR absorption spectra, which can be attributed to increased molecular rigidity induced by boron coordination. In contrast, the dimethylamino&#8208;substituted monoboron complex 4 (fwhm&#160;=&#160;7,580 cm&#8722;1) and diboron complex 8 (fwhm&#160;=&#160;8,770 cm&#8722;1) showed broad absorption bands due to the enhanced intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) character. Dimethylamino&#8208;substituted monoboron complex 4 and diboron complex 8 exhibited panchromatic absorption ranging from 400&#160;nm to 1,000&#160;nm and 400&#160;nm to 1,250&#160;nm, respectively. The panchromatic absorption of the dimethylamino&#8208;substituted boron complexes 4 and 8 is attributed not only to the enhanced ICT character but also to the combination of multiple transitions.

         <title>Graphene Quantum Dots Drive Spontaneous Metal Reduction to form Stable and Electroactive Core&#8208;Shell Nanocolloids</title>

This work demonstrates a spontaneous synthesis of metal (Au, Pt, and Ag) enveloped by crystalline graphene&#8208;quantum dots (GQDs). Aromatic and functional sp2 and sp3 hybridized carbons, within the GQDs shell, play a crucial role upon the synthesis, electronic distribution at the interface, and conductive sites for improving the electrocatalytic response. Au nanohybrids demonstrated two&#8208;fold increase in current density with respect to conventional citrate&#8208;coated Au nanoparticles. This was attributed to conductive sp2&#8208;carbons at the shell and the gain of charge electron density at the surface of Au as demonstrated by DFT calculations.








Abstract
This work demonstrates a spontaneous synthesis of &#8764;8.0, &#8764;7.0, and &#8764;3.0&#160;nm diameter Au, Ag, and Pt cores; respectively, wrapped by as&#8208;synthesized crystalline graphene&#8208;quantum dots (GQDs). Functional sp2&#8208; and sp3&#8208;hybridized carbons play a crucial role upon the synthesis, electronic distribution at the interface, and conductive sites for improving the electrocatalytic response. Au nanohybrids (NHs) demonstrated two&#8208;fold increase in current density with respect to conventional citrate&#8208;coated Au nanoparticles. This was attributed to conductive sp2&#8208; hybridized carbons and the gain of charge density at the surface of Au as demonstrated by DFT calculations. Due to the sp3&#8208;carbons at the shell, these NHs also behave like simple chemical compounds because they can be precipitated, stored for long periods of time, and redispersed without apparent changes in their properties. The resultant nanocolloids exhibit exceptional stability under harsh conditions. These attributes make them useful NHs with great potential for broad applications.

         <title>Direct Visualization of Plasmon&#8208; Induced Hole Injection in Electroactive Luminescent Monolayers on Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 53, September 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the ability of plasmons to switch on the fluorescence of molecular monolayers through a hole injection process, in combination with an electrochemical reduction triggered at the tip and transferred to the monolayer by a redox mediator.








Abstract
A dual and simultaneous modulation of fluorescence intensity and electrochemical current induced by plasmon activation is demonstrated using a combination of electrochemical (SECM) and fluorescence microscopies, employing fluorescent redox monolayers grafted onto gold nanoparticles. The observed electrochemical and optical responses are fully consistent with a direct hole injection from the plasmonically excited metallic nanoparticles into the grafted monolayer. In particular, an unprecedented fluorescence intensity enhancement occurs upon simultaneous electroreduction at the tip and plasmon activation, whereas each process taken separately leads to a fluorescence quenching. The electrochemical current enhancement is significantly larger for functionalized nanoparticles compared to bare ones under plasmon activation, opening the route toward new strategies in photoelectrocatalysis.

&lt;p&gt;This work demonstrates the ability of plasmons to switch on the fluorescence of molecular monolayers through a hole injection process, in combination with an electrochemical reduction triggered at the tip and transferred to the monolayer by a redox mediator.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dual and simultaneous modulation of fluorescence intensity and electrochemical current induced by plasmon activation is demonstrated using a combination of electrochemical (SECM) and fluorescence microscopies, employing fluorescent redox monolayers grafted onto gold nanoparticles. The observed electrochemical and optical responses are fully consistent with a direct hole injection from the plasmonically excited metallic nanoparticles into the grafted monolayer. In particular, an unprecedented fluorescence intensity enhancement occurs upon simultaneous electroreduction at the tip and plasmon activation, whereas each process taken separately leads to a fluorescence quenching. The electrochemical current enhancement is significantly larger for functionalized nanoparticles compared to bare ones under plasmon activation, opening the route toward new strategies in photoelectrocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The NIR&#8208;II photothermal conversion properties of SCO metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are investigated for the first time, offering novel insights into the development of intelligent multifunctional materials.








Abstract
The synthesis of multifunctional materials that exhibit two or more distinct physicochemical properties is critical for the development of advanced smart materials. To date, the research regarding the near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) photothermal properties of spin crossover (SCO) materials remains scarce. Here, we synthesized an inverse&#8208;Hofmann&#8208;type cationic framework, [Fe{Ag(CN)2}(TTF(py)4)]+ (1, TTF(py)4&#160;=&#160;tetra(4&#8208;pyridyl)tetrathiafulvalene), which exhibits hysteretic SCO behavior. By introducing p&#8208;aminoazobenzene (Azo&#8208;NH2) and pyrene (Pyr) into 1, two solvent&#8208;free derivatives, 1@Azo&#8208;NH2 and 1@Pyr, incorporating free radicals were generated. NIR&#8208;II photothermal experiments revealed the outstanding photothermal properties of 1@Azo&#8208;NH2 and 1@Pyr under 1064&#160;nm laser irradiation. Solar&#8208;driven water evaporation experiment demonstrated that 1@Pyr achieved a water evaporation rate of 0.9197&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 with an efficiency of 63.9%. This represents the first demonstration of outstanding NIR&#8208;II photothermal conversion performance in an inverse&#8208;Hofmann&#8208;type metal&#8208;organic framework incorporating free radicals generated through host&#8208;guest interactions. Our findings underscore the critical importance of incorporating NIR absorption units into SCO systems, providing new insights for the development of intelligent multifunctional materials.

         <title>Ru(II)&#8208;Based Photo&#8208;Antibiotics: Light&#8208;Driven Eradication of Bacterial Biofilm and Rapid Healing of Infective Wounds in Wistar Rat</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 53, September 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the development of biocompatible&#160;Ru(II)&#8208;based photo&#8208;antibiotics that increase oxidative stress via ROS generation (both type I and type II pathways) and NADH oxidation, killing bacterial cells and eradicating bacterial biofilm with a novel mechanism. Moreover, the lead photo&#8208;antibiotics eradicated the gram&#8208;negative bacterial colony from the infected wounds in a rat model within 3 days and healed the wound completely within 9 days, bridging the gap between aPDT outcomes and clinical trials.








Abstract
Three novel Ru(II)&#8208;based photoantibiotics,&#160;viz., [Ru(phtpy)(N,N,N)2](PF6)2, where N,N,N&#160;=&#160;4&#8242;&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8243;&#8208;terpyridine (phtpy, Ru1), 4&#8208;([2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridin]&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;yl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylaniline (NMe2tpy, Ru2), trifluoromethylphenyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine (CF3tpy, Ru3) were developed with excellent photostability for visible light&#8208;activated antibacterial activities and infective wound healing. Ru1&#8208;Ru3&#160;exhibited an absorption in the 400&#8211;600&#160;nm range, beneficial for antibacterial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) application. Upon visible light exposure (400&#8208;700&#160;nm),&#160;Ru1&#8208;Ru3&#160;inhibited bacterial growth of Escherichia coli (E. coli), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis), due to the effects of oxidative stress via ROS generation and photo&#8208;oxidation of NADH. Ru3 was identified as a lead antibiotic that further showed antibiofilm activities against E. coli under visible light exposure. Ru3 was found to be biocompatible against rat red blood cells and human embryonic kidney cells. Ru3&#160;+&#160;light promoted rapid healing of infected wounds within 9 days in an E. coli&#8208;induced rat model, highlighting its potential future use in healthcare.

         <title>Steric and Geometric Tuning of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Antennae in Europium(III) Complexes for Selective ADP Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 53, September 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present four new macrocyclic Eu(III) complexes and demonstrate how ligand structure and positional tuning of &#960;&#8208;conjugated antennae modulate steric demand and anion binding site geometry. This enables size and shape complementarity for selective ADP recognition in water over competing phosphoanions.









Abstract
The selective recognition of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) in water presents a significant challenge for synthetic supramolecular chemistry, driven by its biological importance in cellular energy transfer and enzymatic signaling pathways. Discriminating ADP from structurally similar anions such as ATP requires a high degree of host&#8211;guest complementarity. We recently developed [Eu.ADPGlow]&#8722;, a luminescent Eu(III) complex bearing two 6&#8208;substituted quinolyl&#8208;phenoxyacetate arms, which create a binding site at the central Eu(III) ion that accommodates ADP. Binding induces a tight interaction in water, involving both metal coordination and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, switching the emission on with a 33&#8208;fold enhancement. Here, we examine how systematic changes in ligand geometry influence anion selectivity, by synthesizing four new Eu(III) complexes with pendant arms at the 4&#8208; or 7&#8208;positions of the quinoline scaffold. The 4&#8208;substituted systems provide a more accessible binding site and bind ADP, ATP, and AMP with limited selectivity between them, while the 7&#8208;substituted analogues impose steric hindrance at the Eu(III) center, resulting in minimal response to all tested anions. Only the 6&#8208;substituted complex [Eu.ADPGlow]&#8722; achieves optimal geometrical complementarity for ADP binding. These findings reinforce the importance of steric and geometric control in the design of selective lanthanide probes for biological anions in water.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free PMS Activation by Heterocycle Porous Aromatic Frameworks for Contaminant Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

PAF&#8208;146, a porous aromatic framework containing N and S atoms, as a metal&#8208;free catalyst for PMS&#8208;mediated environmental remediation, demonstrates excellent RhB degradation performance through both radical and nonradical pathways.








Abstract
Heteroatoms in heterocycles significantly modify the redox properties of the catalysts, thus exhibiting high efficiency, environmental friendliness, and applicability in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) without metals. Therefore, a porous aromatic framework (PAF&#8208;146) rich in N and S atoms was synthesized from heterocycle building units and exhibited excellent stability. Benefiting from the stability and catalytic activity of PAF&#8208;146, it demonstrated a catalytic performance of degrading 99.7% of Rhodamine B (RhB) within 20&#160;minutes, with a reaction rate constant 95 times higher than that of pristine PAF without N and S atoms. Moreover, PAF&#8208;146 exhibited good resistance to interference from anions, different aquatic environments, and humic acid (HA). The strongly electronegative N and S atoms in PAF&#8208;146 initiated the redistribution of charge density, resulting in positively charged adjacent C atoms. Peroxymonosulfate (PMS) underwent a nucleophilic addition reaction on these C atoms, triggering electron transfer and ultimately leading to the formation of 1O2 and O2&#8226;&#8722;. It was revealed that PAF&#8208;146 achieved efficient degradation of RhB through a combination of radical and nonradical pathways.

&lt;p&gt;PAF-146, a porous aromatic framework containing N and S atoms, as a metal-free catalyst for PMS-mediated environmental remediation, demonstrates excellent RhB degradation performance through both radical and nonradical pathways.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heteroatoms in heterocycles significantly modify the redox properties of the catalysts, thus exhibiting high efficiency, environmental friendliness, and applicability in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) without metals. Therefore, a porous aromatic framework (PAF-146) rich in N and S atoms was synthesized from heterocycle building units and exhibited excellent stability. Benefiting from the stability and catalytic activity of PAF-146, it demonstrated a catalytic performance of degrading 99.7% of Rhodamine B (RhB) within 20&#160;minutes, with a reaction rate constant 95 times higher than that of pristine PAF without N and S atoms. Moreover, PAF-146 exhibited good resistance to interference from anions, different aquatic environments, and humic acid (HA). The strongly electronegative N and S atoms in PAF-146 initiated the redistribution of charge density, resulting in positively charged adjacent C atoms. Peroxymonosulfate (PMS) underwent a nucleophilic addition reaction on these C atoms, triggering electron transfer and ultimately leading to the formation of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. It was revealed that PAF-146 achieved efficient degradation of RhB through a combination of radical and nonradical pathways. Our work provides guidance for the development of efficient metal-free catalysts with abundant catalytic sites for PMS-activation in environmental remediation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of the Soft Lewis Superacid Tris(4&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorophenyl)borane B(C6F4Br)3 via C&#8210;Ag to C&#8210;B Transmetalation</title>

         <dc:description>
The soft Lewis acid B(C6F4Br)3 was synthesized via transmetalation from AgC6F4Br, and its Lewis acidity was assessed via DFT calculations and experimental methods, indicating an increased acidity compared to B(C6F5)3. The presence of bromine atoms is expected to facilitate structural analysis of Lewis acid&#8208;base adducts of B(C6F4Br)3 by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction in the future.








Abstract
The Lewis acid tris(4&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorophenyl)borane B(C6F4Br)3 was synthesized via transmetalation from BBr3 and AgC6F4Br. The latter was prepared from 1,4&#8208;C6F4BrSiMe3 with AgF and crystallized as a toluene solvate [2(AgC6F4Br)4&#8226;7.46(toluene)]. The solid&#8208;state structure of free B(C6F4Br)3 and its Lewis base adducts with EtCN, H2O, and POEt3 was determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. DFT calculations show that B(C6F4Br)3 has approximately 1% higher fluoride and hydride ion affinities (FIA and HIA) than tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane B(C6F5)3. Similarly, the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method indicates an increase in Lewis acidity of 2%, whereas IR spectroscopy of the CD3CN adducts reveals a slightly lower &#7805;(CN) vibration for B(C6F4Br)3. The presence of bromine atoms is expected to facilitate structural analysis of Lewis acid&#8208;base adducts of B(C6F4Br)3 by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction in the future.

         <title>Catalyst Design and Mechanistic Insights for Non&#8208;Thermal Plasma Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we systematically explore the enhancement pathways of plasma&#8208;assisted ammonia synthesis and deeply analyze the unique mechanism of action of various catalyst design strategies, such as shielding protection, defect engineering, local electric field enhancement, and antenna/size effect, in the plasma&#8208;assisted ammonia synthesis system. Based on the latest research progress in plasma ammonia synthesis, we comprehensively evaluate the technological routes of emerging plasma ammonia synthesis systems and suggest feasible directions for future research in this field.








Abstract
Hydrogen storage technology based on ammonia carriers is a key part of the transition from fossil fuels to low&#8208;carbon energy sources. However, the high energy consumption and high carbon path dependency of the traditional ammonia industry are the core challenges constraining the development of current technologies. In this review, we focus on the core advantages of low&#8208;temperature plasma chemistry in ammonia synthesis, including mild conditions, environmental friendliness, flexibility, and controllability. We then propose a powerful approach for transitioning traditional ammonia synthesis technology in a sustainable direction. Firstly, we systematically sort out the time evolution of the plasma ammonia synthesis reactor and elucidate the mode of action of plasma&#8208;assisted ammonia synthesis. In particular, we provide an in&#8208;depth analysis of design optimization strategies for plasma catalysts to explore key catalytic mechanisms in ammonia synthesis systems. Finally, we evaluate the performance index of the existing plasma ammonia synthesis system and suggest feasible directions for future research to further improve the energy efficiency of the technology, promoting the development of the ammonia production process in a more sustainable and advanced direction.

         <title>GCI&#8208;Based Affinity Screening of Synthetic Oligomannosides toward Concanavalin A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes the development of a reliable GCI method for the affinity determination of neo&#8208;glycoproteins toward concanavalin A (ConA), a model lectin. The final goal is to investigate multivalent carbohydrate&#8211;lectin interactions.








Abstract
Herein, we report the first application of grating&#8208;coupled interferometry (GCI) to quantify the binding affinity of synthetically defined mannose&#8208;based neo&#8208;glycoproteins to Concanavalin A (ConA), a model lectin for carbohydrate recognition. Mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;saccharides were conjugated to carrier proteins to create multivalent ligands in a structurally defined yet heterogeneous format. Unlike free sugars, which can interact with lectins in multiple orientations, conjugation constrains sugar presentation and provides a more realistic proxy of how glycans are encountered in glycoconjugates. This approach enabled a systematic comparison of sugar epitopes, confirming that Man(&#945;1,2)Man motif shows stronger binding than Man(&#945;1,6), and that the trisaccharide displays the highest affinity. Notably, the multivalent display of these relatively simple sugar motifs resulted in affinities comparable to or higher than those of natural glycoproteins, highlighting the contribution of valency and presentation rather than glycan complexity. Dissociation constants measured by GCI are consistent with literature values obtained by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and other methods, confirming the reliability of this platform. This work establishes GCI as a reliable tool for affinity profiling of glycoconjugates and highlights the value of a simple and reproducible screening strategy for evaluating structure&#8211;affinity relationships of glycans in a presentation format closer to their intended applications.

         <title>Copper(II) Complexes with Schiff Bases Derived from 2&#8208;Pyridinecarbaldehyde N&#8208;Oxide and Amino Acids: Studies on DNA, BSA Binding, Nuclease Activity, and Cytotoxicity</title>

         <dc:description>
A new type of Schiff&#8208;base ligands obtained by a condensation of an N&#8208;oxide aldehyde and amino acids is introduced. Synthesis and structures of their copper(II) complexes with promising biological activities including anticancer properties are described.








Abstract
Synthesis of the first example of metal complexes containing Schiff&#8208;base ligands derived from amino acids and aldehyde with N&#8208;oxide functionality is presented. Five copper(II) complexes with the compositions [Cu(L1)(H2O)(OAc)]&#8901;H2O (1), [Cu3(L2)2Cl4(H2O)2] (2), [Cu4(L2)2Cl6(MeOH)2] (3), [Cu2(L3)Cl3(H2O)] (4), and [Cu3(L3)2Cl3(H2O)3]Cl (5) (where anionic ligands L1 &#8211; L3 are Schiff bases obtained by condensation of 2&#8208;pyridinecarbaldehyde N&#8208;oxide with 2&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (HL1), &#946;&#8208;alanine (HL2), and 3&#8208;aminobutanoic acid (HL3)) were prepared by template synthesis and fully crystallographically characterized. Complexes 1 &#8211; 4 were examined for DNA interactions, competitive studies with EB&#8208;DNA, viscosity measurements, DNA cleavage studies, cytotoxicity studies, interactions with bovine serum albumin (BSA), and theoretical docking studies. The studied complexes bind to the helix through a nonintercalative binding mode; the interaction of complexes with ctDNA is predominantly via intercalation, while viscosity measurements indicate mostly groove binding. DNA cleavage studies revealed the highest cleavage activity for&#160;complex 1. The MTT assay on three human cell lines shows the highest cytotoxic effect for complex 1 against HepG2 (human liver cancer cell line). Experimental interaction of studied complexes with BSA indicates an intermediate binding strength between complexes and albumin, while theoretical docking studies identify possible binding sites of complexes within the BSA.

Five copper(II) complexes with the compositions [Cu(L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)(OAc)]&#8901;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), [Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), [Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(MeOH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), [Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)] (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;), and [Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;) (where anionic ligands L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &#8211; L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; are Schiff bases obtained by condensation of 2-pyridinecarbaldehyde N-oxide with 2-aminoisobutyric acid (HL&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;), &#946;-alanine (HL&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and 3-aminobutanoic acid (HL&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)) were prepared by template synthesis and fully crystallographically characterized. Complexes &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; &#8211; &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; were examined for DNA interactions, competitive studies with EB-DNA, viscosity measurements, DNA cleavage studies, cytotoxicity studies, interactions with bovine serum albumin (BSA), and theoretical docking studies. The studied complexes bind to the helix through a nonintercalative binding mode; the interaction of complexes with ctDNA is predominantly via intercalation, while viscosity measurements indicate mostly groove binding. DNA cleavage studies revealed the highest cleavage activity for&#160;complex &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;. The MTT assay on three human cell lines shows the highest cytotoxic effect for complex &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; against HepG2 (human liver cancer cell line). Experimental interaction of studied complexes with BSA indicates an intermediate binding strength between complexes and albumin, while theoretical docking studies identify possible binding sites of complexes within the BSA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Promoted Acceptor&#8208;less Dehydrogenation of a Germane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chloride abstraction from half&#8208;sandwich ruthenium complexes leads to the generation of stable, but highly reactive, dinitrogen and triflate complexes that can activate Ge&#9472;H bonds. Reaction of the activated ruthenium complexes with GeH2Ph2leads to elimination of dihydrogen and formation of triflate&#8208;stabilized metallogermylenium complexes.








Abstract
The transition metal&#8208;mediated activation of element&#8211;hydrogen bonds is an important goal for the preparation of commodity chemical compounds and novel materials. Here a facile route to the activation of germanium&#8208;hydrogen bonds, based on the spontaneous elimination of dihydrogen, is reported. This represents a mechanistic divergence from the established methods for Ge&#9472;H bond cleavage. The novel complexes [Ru(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)(OTf)(PPh3)2] and [{Ru(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)(dppe)}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)]OTf2 are central to the success of this route. These crystalline species may be prepared in high yield and are highly effective sources of the 16&#8208;electron [Ru(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)(P)2]+ fragment. Both complexes react with GeH2Ph2 to eliminate H2 and afford [Ru(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)(GePh2OTf)(P)2] [(P)2&#160;=&#160;2 PPh3, dppe], which is best described as a triflate&#8208;stabilized metallogermylenium complex. Different species are observed on initial treatment of [Ru(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)(OTf)(PPh3)2] or [{Ru(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)(dppe)}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)]OTf2 with GeH2Ph2. In the dppe case, a &#963;&#8208;germane complex is identified, which is proposed to undergo spontaneous elimination of H2: a key step in the double Ge&#9472;H bond activation, promoted by the sterically demanding half&#8208;sandwich ruthenium complexes. This represents a distinct pathway for Ge&#9472;H bond activation when compared to the established routes, such as deprotonation by a basic hydrocarbyl ligand or oxidative addition, leading the way to new pathways to functionalize organogermanium compounds.

         <title>pH&#8211;Dependent Luminescence of Self&#8211;Assembly Tb3+ Complexes with Photosensitizing Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amphiphilic lanthanide complex with photosensitizer units forms stable self&#8208;assemblies in aqueous ethanol (20&#160;wt.% EtOH). The pyridyl group effectively works as both a photoantenna and a proton acceptor. Self&#8208;assemblies of the Tb3+ complex exhibit pH&#8211;dependent luminescence under weakly basic conditions, rendering it promising for biological applications.








Abstract
Luminescent metal complexes in aqueous solution have been attracting substantial interest as chemical and biological sensors. In this study, aiming to develop lanthanide complexes that exhibit bright luminescence in aqueous media, we designed and synthesized new amphiphilic ligands based on ethylenediamine with two aromatic groups and two cholesteryl groups, which act as photosensitizers and hydrophobic moieties, respectively. In particular, the Tb3+ complex of a pyridyl&#8208;substituted ligand showed an intense green emission that stems from the efficient energy transfer from the excited pyridyl groups to the Tb center in ethanol. In aqueous media, the Tb3+ complexes self&#8208;assembled into nanoparticles with diameters of around 40&#160;nm, which show pH&#8211;dependent luminescence in the pH range of 6.0&#8211;8.5 ascribable to protonation of the coordinated pyridyl groups. These findings demonstrate the potential of aggregates of photosensitized lanthanide complexes as sensors under weakly alkaline conditions.

Tuning unusual energy and eT processes in a bis(acridinium&#8208;Zn(II) porphyrin)&#8208;tetrapyridyl porphyrin host&#8208;guest complex.








Abstract
The 1:1 complex of a bis(acridinium&#8208;Zn(II)porphyrin) host and a tetrapyridyl free&#8208;base porphyrin guest shows a remarkable interplay of energy and electron transfer (eT) processes, finely tuned by the solvent polarity or the selection of the photoexcited component. A more polar environment (CH2Cl2) favors uncommon parallel intramolecular and intermolecular eT processes, while in an apolar solvent (toluene) the intermolecular eT process is hampered. Notably, the apolar environment also enables a rare energy transfer process from the porphyrin guest toward the charge&#8208;transfer emissive state of the tweezer host. In total, no less than four different excited states were probed, which can be sketched by an inverted pyramid diagram highlighting directional path selection.

         <title>Toward Organic Mimics of Metallic Nanoparticles: Tuning and Enhancing Fluorescence in Binary Dye&#8208;Based Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binary Fluorescent Organic Nanoparticles (&#1074;FONs) are made from two optically complementary polar and polarizable dyes (energy donor D and acceptor A). Core&#8208;shell &#1074;FONs exhibit Nano Interfacial Emission Enhancement (NIEE), i.e. an enhanced fluorescence quantum yield and a blueshifted emission, compared to alloy &#1074;FONs of identical composition&#8208;but devoid of core&#8208;shell topology. The NIEE effect is found to increase with the donor&#8208;to&#8208;acceptor ratio.








Abstract
A key characteristic of binary metallic nanoparticles is the extreme tuneability of their optical properties through small changes in their composition and structure. Organic mimics of such binary metallic nanoparticles with similar properties would be of major interest. Here, we present Binary Fluorescent Organic Nanoparticles (hereafter termed &#1074;FONs) made from two structurally similar but optically complementary polar and polarizable dyes (PPDs) (i.e., energy donor D and energy acceptor A) as such potential mimics. We designed dye&#8208;based core&#8208;shell and alloy &#1074;FONs with varying composition (i.e., D versus A content) and investigated their fluorescence properties. In both core&#8208;shell and alloy &#1074;FONs, the donor dyes efficiently harvest energy&#8211;through F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)&#8211;resulting in substantial brightness values (up to 1.3 108 M&#8722;1cm&#8722;1 per nanoparticle). However, &#1074;FONs' luminescence properties were found to strongly depend on their nanostructuration. Core&#8208;shell &#1074;FONs exhibit a Nano Interfacial Emission Enhancement (NIEE) effect, consisting in a blue&#8208;shifted fluorescence and enhanced FRET&#8208;mediated fluorescence quantum yield, compared to alloy &#1074;FONs of identical composition&#8211;but devoid of a core&#8208;shell topology. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time that the extent of this NIEE effect directly depends on &#1074;FONs composition, and increases with the D/A ratio. Furthermore, bioimaging in live cells reveals that &#1074;FONs retain their binary nature and unique fluorescence properties in cellular environments.

&lt;p&gt;Binary Fluorescent Organic Nanoparticles (&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;&#1074;FONs&lt;/span&gt;) are made from two optically complementary polar and polarizable dyes (energy donor D and acceptor A). Core-shell &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;&#1074;FONs&lt;/span&gt; exhibit Nano Interfacial Emission Enhancement (NIEE), i.e. an enhanced fluorescence quantum yield and a blueshifted emission, compared to alloy &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;&#1074;FONs&lt;/span&gt; of identical composition-but devoid of core-shell topology. The NIEE effect is found to increase with the donor-to-acceptor ratio.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key characteristic of binary metallic nanoparticles is the extreme tuneability of their optical properties through small changes in their composition and structure. Organic mimics of such binary metallic nanoparticles with similar properties would be of major interest. Here, we present Binary Fluorescent Organic Nanoparticles (hereafter termed &#1074;FONs) made from two structurally similar but optically complementary &lt;i&gt;polar and polarizable dyes (PPDs)&lt;/i&gt; (i.e., energy donor D and energy acceptor A) as such potential mimics. We designed dye-based core-shell and alloy &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;&#1074;FONs&lt;/span&gt; with varying composition (i.e., D versus A content) and investigated their fluorescence properties. In both core-shell and alloy &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;&#1074;FONs&lt;/span&gt;, the donor dyes efficiently harvest energy&#8211;through F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)&#8211;resulting in substantial brightness values (up to 1.3 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; per nanoparticle). However, &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;&#1074;FONs&lt;/span&gt;' luminescence properties were found to strongly depend on their nanostructuration. Core-shell &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;&#1074;FONs&lt;/span&gt; exhibit a Nano Interfacial Emission Enhancement (NIEE) effect, consisting in a blue-shifted fluorescence and enhanced FRET-mediated fluorescence quantum yield, compared to alloy &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;&#1074;FONs&lt;/span&gt; of identical composition&#8211;but devoid of a core-shell topology. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time that the extent of this NIEE effect directly depends on &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;&#1074;FONs&lt;/span&gt; composition, and increases with the D/A ratio. Furthermore, bioimaging in live cells reveals that &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;&#1074;FONs&lt;/span&gt; retain their binary nature and unique fluorescence properties in cellular environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

An angelic figure holds a dinuclear dinitrosyl iron complex (DNIC) formed from {Fe(NO)2}10 and {Fe(NO)2}&#8313; mononuclear precursors. With its rare &#956;&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;FBF3 bridge and stabilization by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, the complex symbolizes the delicate balance of redox and structural forces in coordination chemistry.








Abstract
Reaction of a {Fe(NO)3}10 trinitrosyl iron complex with a mononuclear {Fe(NO)2}10 dinitrosyl iron complex furnishes a dinuclear dinitrosyl iron complex, [(NO)2(IMes)Fe(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;FBF3)Fe(IMes)(NO)2] (3) (IMes&#160;=&#160;1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals an unprecedented &#956;&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;FBF3&#8722; bridge that links two [Fe(NO)2] motifs, giving an Fe&#8230;.Fe separation of 3.45&#160;&#197;. Nonclassical C&#9472;H&#8230;F contacts (3.21 &#8211; 3.61&#160;&#197;) between the mesityl methyl groups of the IMes and the nonbridging fluorine atom cradle the anion and create a pseudo&#8208;tridentate environment that stabilizes the mixed&#8208;valent core. Infrared spectroscopy exhibits four &#957;(NO) bands at 1778, 1736, 1715, and 1682 cm&#8722;1, inferring the presence of two electronically different {Fe(NO)2} units, whereas 77&#160;K EPR spectroscopy gives a rhombic signal with gavg&#160;=&#160;2.109, diagnostic of an s&#160;=&#160;1/2 species in complex 3.

         <title>Reactivity of Square Planar Pt(II) Complexes Toward Acidic Moieties as H+, M+, and [ML]+ (M&#160;=&#160;Ag, Au)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the fact that Pt(II) in square&#8208;planar complexes exhibits Lewis basic properties toward electrophilic species (E&#8314;), the presence of oxygen atoms acting as competing Lewis basic sites leads to the formation of Pt&#9472;O&#9472;E&#8314;&#9472;O&#9472;Pt or Pt&#9472;O&#9472;E&#8314; type complexes, in which no direct metal&#8211;metal bonds are observed. The formation of analogous species with either H&#8314; or [M&#8211;L]&#8314; fragments can be connected to the concept of isolobality between these electrophilic entities.








Abstract
The Lewis base (LB) properties of the d8 Pt(II) are manifested in the formation of Pt&#8594;E species, where E are electrophiles such as acidic hydrogens or metal cations. Thus, the reactions of [Pt(CNC)(dmso)] (CNC&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;di(phen&#8208;2&#8208;ide)&#8208;pyridine) toward PPh2(C6H4&#8208;o&#8208;COOH) or PPh2(C6H4&#8208;o&#8208;OH) produce complexes [Pt(CNC&#8208;H){PPh2(C6H4&#8208;o&#8208;COO)}] (1) and [Pt(CNC&#8208;H){PPh2(C6H4&#8208;o&#8208;O)}] (2). Their X&#8208;ray structures confirm the proton transfer from the OH at the phosphane to one of the phenylene rings of the CNC ligand. Then, the deprotonated oxygen occupies the vacant site. It is proposed that the transfer starts with a hydrogen bond (Pt&#8594;H) which evolves to the final products favored by the planar nature of the CNC ligand. 1 and 2 react with Ag+ and [M(PPh3)]+ (M&#160;=&#160;Ag, Au) giving rise to complexes without Pt&#9472;M bonds, but O&#9472;M or O&#9472;Ag&#9472;O instead. Their structures reveal that the oxygen atoms present in 1 and 2 advantageously compete with the Pt as the donor entity for the incoming acidic metal. Moreover, dinuclear complexes with O&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O systems structurally analogous to the O&#9472;Ag&#9472;O have been prepared and characterized. They reinforce the idea of resemblance of the proton and cations such as Ag+, Au+, [AgL]+, and [AuL]+ as Lewis acidic moieties, which is consistent with the concept of isolobality.

         <title>Ultrafine Pd Nanoparticles on Triphenylphosphine&#8208;Covalent Organic Framework for Dual Photo/Thermal Catalysis of Scalable C&#8208;C/C&#8208;N Cross&#8208;Couplings</title>

         <dc:description>
This study develops a phosphine&#8208;functionalized COF&#8208;supported ultrafine Pd nanoparticle catalyst (TyPPc&#8208;P@Pd NPs). It enables efficient thermal and photocatalytic C&#8208;C/C&#8208;N cross&#8208;couplings, including with less reactive aryl chlorides, demonstrating high activity, broad applicability, excellent stability, and recyclability for sustainable synthesis.








Abstract
The development of highly active and reusable heterogeneous catalysts for scalable organic synthesis remains a critical challenge. Here, a covalent organic framework (TyPPc&#8208;COF) with aldehyde residues was synthesized and post&#8208;modified with triphenylphosphine ligands to construct TyPPc&#8208;P&#8208;COF. Subsequently, ultrafine Pd nanoparticles (2.73&#160;nm) were uniformly anchored onto TyPPc&#8208;P&#8208;COF via phosphine&#8208;Pd coordination. The resultant TyPPc&#8208;P@Pd NPs exhibit dual&#8208;mode catalytic functionality: In C&#8208;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving aryl iodides, this catalyst demonstrates excellent performance under both thermal catalytic conditions (50&#160;mg catalyst, TOF&#160;=&#160;1060 h&#8722;1) and photocatalytic conditions (30&#160;mg catalyst, TOF&#160;=&#160;1780 h&#8722;1), achieving gram&#8208;scale yields (&gt;80%). Notably, under both photocatalytic and thermal catalytic conditions, this catalyst also efficiently catalyzes Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura, Heck, and Sonogashira C&#8208;C coupling reactions involving aryl bromides and aryl chlorides, which typically exhibit lower activity. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that light irradiation can effectively extend catalytic functionality to C&#8208;N bond formation. Stability tests revealed negligible Pd leaching/aggregation after multiple cycles, confirming structural robustness. This work provides a general strategy for designing COF@MNPs merging high activity, recyclability, and environmental compatibility, advancing sustainable organic synthesis.

         <title>Carbon Dots as Nano&#8208;Photocatalysts: A Green Tool for Indole and Heteroarenes Alkylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nano&#8208;photocatalytic method for the functionalization of indoles and heteroarenes is reported. The reaction is promoted by the photocatalytic activity of carbon nanodots, which was thoroughly investigated by mechanistic studies to determine the reaction mechanism. The developed procedure allowed for the preparation of alkylated heteroarenes with good yields (up to 88%), with good functional group tolerance, with the possibility to recycle the nanocatalysts up to 5 times without hindering the reaction outcomes.








Abstract
Taking into account the hurdles of climate change and environmental pollution, through the years, the development of sustainable protocols in catalysis stands as a cornerstone to answer those issues. Carbon dots (CDs) have recently proven to be efficient in various types of catalysis, including photocatalytic reactions, while being a green and economic alternative for metal catalysts. In this paper, we present a new catalytic system for the photoredox functionalization of indoles and heteroarenes derivatives based on CDs as nano&#8208;photocatalysts. This reaction, based on the cooperation between our catalyst and 2,6&#8208;lutidine, shows the ability to functionalize these compounds up to 88%, it is effective on 1&#160;mmol scale, and shows a recyclability potential at least to 5 cycles. This system also demonstrated the capacity of obtaining rare types on indoles, having two electron withdrawing groups (EWG), both on the carbon 2 (C2) and carbon 3 (C3). Furthermore, careful studies led to the partial resolution of the mechanism, and to explanations on the regioselectivity of the reaction, which has been studied through the nature of both reagents and substrates, but also through the light's wavelength used in the reaction.

         <title>Oxidant&#8208;Triggered Bioconjugation Chemistry: Expanding the Landscape of Ligandable Lysine Residues in the Proteome</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of covalent drugs targeting lysine residues represents a transformative frontier in chemical biology and drug discovery. Despite the abundance of lysine (5.6% of proteomic residues) and its functional versatility, exploration has been hindered by the lack of robust methods to profile its reactivity and ligandability. This work introduces a new oxidant&#8208;triggered bioconjugation platform that enables global mapping of lysine residues, and reveals over 7,000 covalently modifiable sites. By leveraging hydroxamic acid probes activated by soluble and low&#8208;toxicity sodium periodate (NaIO4), this strategy overcomes the limitations of traditional electrophiles and provides insights into the role of lysines in protein function and disease. The platform can be applied to kinase profiling, cancer target discovery, and covalent inhibitor development, offering a potential strategy for addressing &#8220;undruggable&#8221; proteins.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed P&#8208;Arylation of HP(= O)(R/OR)2 Nucleophiles with (Hetero)Aryl Chlorides Enabled by DalPhos Ligation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Herein we disclose our development of broadly useful C&#8208;P cross&#8208;couplings of (hetero)aryl chlorides and HP(O)(R)2 or HP(O)(OR)2 nucleophiles, enabled by use of nickel/DalPhos&#8208;based catalysts. These typically use 5 mol% nickel at 110 &#176;C for 18&#160;hours, but the feasibility of shorter or milder reactions was demonstrated with one specific example. The ability to apply such transformations on gram scale, and in the P&#8208;arylation of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) (i.e., chloroquine and clozapine) was also shown. Also described are our findings arising from the computational modelling of such cross&#8208;coupling reactions by use of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which confirmed the clear preference for C&#8208;P bond formation involving three&#8208;centered reductive elimination through substrate PV pathways.

         <title>Experimental and Computational Investigation of Surface&#8208;Responsive Riboflavin&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Assembled Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled crystal of riboflavin exhibits responsive modes of surface&#8208;directed molecular assembly, accompanied by measurable electromechanical properties. This behavior highlights how subtle variations in molecular packing and supramolecular interactions at the crystal interface can directly influence macroscopic functional responses. By bridging the molecular organization with emergent physical properties, these findings elucidate key structure&#8211;function relationships, offering new perspectives for the design of bioinspired materials with tunable electromechanical properties.








Abstract
Metabolites, including amino acids, nucleobases, and vitamins, have emerged as promising candidates for sustainable functional materials due to their inherent biocompatibility and low fabrication costs. Notable examples include glycine&#8208;based nanogenerators, indigo&#8208;based organic transistors, and caffeine&#8208;based optical waveguides. Riboflavin (vitamin B2), forms optically active supramolecular structures in the tapetum lucidum of lemurs and cats; however, its detailed packing and functional role remain unknown. Here, aiming to explore the bio&#8208;inspired self&#8208;assembly of riboflavin to uncover potential device applications, we discovered and extensively characterized a new single co&#8208;crystal using a combination of crystallography, microscopy, and mechanical experiments supported by atomistic molecular models to understand the organization on different surfaces. The crystals exhibit pronounced surface responsiveness, leading to the formation of distinct branched, twisted, and serrated micron&#8208;scale morphologies as the riboflavin self&#8208;assembled on different substrates of copper, mica, and silicon. This intrinsic ability to adapt shape and generate substrate&#8208;templated structures was confirmed computationally and experimentally and was attributed mainly to the crystal's relatively low Young's modulus, reflecting its lattice flexibility. This structure&#8211;function study of an adaptable metabolite crystal offers fundamental insights into how molecular organization governs mechanical responsiveness, advancing the understanding of bio&#8208;inspired crystallization and paving the way for future technological applications.

         <title>Ag5Pd2O4, a New Subvalent Silver Oxide, Obtained from Ag2PdO2 via a High&#8208;pressure Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag5Pd2O4 has been obtained from the reaction of Ag2PdO2 at a hydrostatic pressure of &#8764;30&#160;GPa and laser heating at 1500&#160;K in a diamond anvil cell (DAC). The new oxide exhibits very short Ag&#8208;Ag distances and is subvalent with respect to silver. Quantum chemical calculations describe the new compound as metallic conducting.








Abstract
Subvalent silver oxides, where silver exhibits an oxidation state between 0 and&#160;+&#160;1, have traditionally been discovered serendipitously due to a lack of systematic synthesis methods and understanding of their bonding schemes. This study presents a novel, purposeful approach to synthesizing multinary subvalent silver oxides through high&#8208;pressure techniques. By subjecting the monovalent silver oxide Ag2PdO2 to hydrostatic pressure of &#8764;30&#160;GPa and laser heating at 1500&#160;K, subvalent Ag5Pd2O4 forms besides PdO. The crystal structure of Ag5Pd2O4, determined via in situ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, reveals distinct layers of cationic silver aggregates and anionic oxopalladate units. Electronic structure calculations confirm the subvalent nature of silver in Ag5Pd2O4, showing a vanished band gap and increased electron density on silver atoms. The findings pave the way for developing materials with rich magneto&#8208;electronic functionalities, owing to the interplay between subvalent silver and transition metal cations.

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of Lipid&#8208;Modified Derivatives of Tunicamycins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tunicamycins inhibit the bacterial enzyme MraY, which is involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis, but they also inhibit human GPT, leading to cytotoxicity. This study investigated the structure&#8208;activity relationship of the fatty acyl chain of tunicamycin to develop MraY&#8208;selective inhibitors, based on structural differences between MraY and GPT. As a result, an analogue was identified that exhibited antibacterial activity without cytotoxicity.








Abstract
Naturally occurring antibiotic tunicamycin targets bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis by inhibiting bacterial phospho&#8208;N&#8208;acetylmuraminic acid (MurNAc)&#8208;pentapeptide translocase (MraY), but it also inhibits human UDP&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc): polyprenol phosphate translocase (GPT), leading to cytotoxicity. This study thoroughly investigated the structure&#8208;activity relationship of the fatty acyl side chain of tunicamycin to develop MraY&#8208;selective inhibitors, based on structural differences between MraY and GPT. Longer alkyl chains and flexible structures were found to favor MraY inhibitory activity, and benzene rings were acceptable for binding. The hybrid analogue containing oleoyl group, which contributed most significantly to MraY inhibitory activity, and the MurNAc moiety, which is important for MraY&#8208;selective inhibition, showed enhanced MraY inhibitory activity as well as improved antibacterial activity against S. aureus and E. faecium.

         <title>Injectable Hyaluronic Acid Hydrogel Integrated with Hybrid Nanovesicles for Synergistic Enhancement of Transdermal Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile Hybrid&#8208;Gel platform combining CoQ10&#8208;loaded hybrid nanovesicles with an injectable, pH&#8208;responsive hydrogel network significantly enhances transdermal drug delivery efficiency, offering a robust strategy for localized therapy.








Abstract
Plant&#8208;derived nanovesicles offer promising potential for transdermal drug delivery due to their inherent biocompatibility and low immunogenicity, yet face limitations in drug loading, structural stability, and functional optimization. This study presents a versatile Hybrid&#8208;Gel platform that integrates CoQ10&#8208;loaded hybrid vesicles with an injectable, pH&#8208;responsive hydrogel to enhance localized drug delivery. High&#8208;purity nanovesicles are isolated using an optimized ultracentrifugation (UC) and size&#8208;exclusion chromatography (SEC) method, then hybridized with liposomes to improve encapsulation and skin penetration. To further optimize localized delivery performance, an injectable binary hydrogel system is then introduced. This hydrogel, formed via Schiff base crosslinking between hyperbranched polyethylene glycol and aldehyde&#8208;modified hyaluronic acid (A&#8208;HA), exhibits mild gelation conditions, excellent injectability, and strong tissue adhesion. The hydrogel effectively encapsulates hybrid nanovesicles, ensuring enhanced stability, ease of administration, and controlled, pH&#8208;responsive release. As a proof of concept, an in vitro permeation test with porcine skin model demonstrates that the hydrogel significantly improves CoQ10 penetration, achieving a more than fourfold increase in transdermal efficiency compared to free CoQ10, suggesting superior bioavailability. This synergistic approach, combining hybrid nanovesicle&#8208;mediated drug transport with a dynamic hydrogel matrix, offers a robust and versatile platform for localized transdermal therapy, with potential applications in precision medicine, regenerative treatments, and chronic disease management.

         <title>Directing Effects of Silyl and Germyl Groups in Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the maturity of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed allylic substitution, unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;disubstituted electrophiles remain underexplored due to inherent regioselectivity challenges. This Concept highlights the strategic use of silyl and germyl groups to overcome this limitation, steering bond formation with high regiocontrol and serving as linchpins for further molecular diversification.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed allylic substitution is a well&#8208;established strategy for the formation of carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds. However, most methods remain incompatible with unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allylic electrophiles as regioselectivity becomes difficult to control when the substituents are electronically and sterically similar. Achieving simultaneous control over the enantio&#8208; and regioselectivity as well as the alkene geometry poses an even greater challenge. To address this, sterically and electronically influential main&#8208;group elements such as carbon's heavier homologues silicon and germanium have been strategically incorporated. These metalloids can steer the bond formation away from their proximity enabling the formation of a single regioisomer while also serving as versatile linchpins for further functionalization. This Concept summarizes the key advancements made in the field since the discovery of the allylic substitution with a particular focus on silyl&#8208; and germyl&#8208;directed strategies that have expanded the synthetic utility of this highly valuable transformation.

         <title>Molecule&#8208;Induced Radical Formation (MIRF) Reaction of Et2BOOEt with Et3B is Key to the Et3B/O2 Radical Initiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Open to air Et3B is a common radical initiator. Contrary to previous suggestions, most initiating Et&#8226; radicals in this system are formed in a molecule&#8208;induced radical formation (MIRF) reaction of Et2BOOEt with Et3B, and not in Et3B autoxidation. This reaction of Et2BOOEt with Et3B could be used as a radical initiator in its own right, providing higher radical flux than Et3B/O2, as demonstrated in several model reactions.








Abstract
Open&#8208;to&#8208;air triethylborane (Et3B) is a well&#8208;known room&#8208;temperature initiator of free radical reactions. Current consensus is that the initiating species in this system are ethyl radicals formed in the triethylborane autoxidation cycle, although some early studies suggested that reactions of the oxidation products can also contribute to the initiation. We report a quantitative mechanistic study which demonstrates that most ethyl radicals in the triethylborane initiator system are not formed in the autoxidation cycle but instead are generated by a Molecule&#8208;Induced Radical Formation (MIRF) reaction between triethylborane and its main oxidation product, ethylperoxyborane Et2BOOEt (secondary initiation). A simplified kinetic model allowed us to predict optimal conditions for the initiation, and propose the MIRF reaction as an alternative, homogeneous initiator system. The high efficiency of this initiator has been demonstrated in several model radical reactions.

         <title>Spatially Resolved 2D Laser Writing on Graphene Using Diazonium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive investigation of laser&#8208;induced covalent patterning, defunctionalization, and refunctionalization of single&#8208;layer graphene with aryl diazonium salts is reported. Scanning Raman microscopy verifies spatial control, while systematic variation of laser parameters and substituent effects highlights the versatility of the method. The demonstrated &#8220;write&#8208;erase&#8208;rewrite&#8221; capability establishes a robust platform for micrometer&#8208;scale fabrication of complex, functionalized graphene architectures.








Abstract
We present the first investigation of precise laser&#8208;guided patterning, functionalization, defunctionalization, and refunctionalization of single&#8208;layer graphene (SLG) with three different aryl diazonium salts. Using scanning Raman microscopy (SRM) we confirmed the spatially resolved nature of the functionalization. We systematically investigated the influence of key laser parameters (power, irradiation time, and wavelength) and the electronic effects of the substituents on both the functionalization efficiency and integrity of graphene. Our solid&#8208;phase approach unequivocally demonstrates that laser&#8208;triggered covalent attachment can achieve high functionalization levels comparable to solution&#8208;based methods. We also unveil a novel laser&#8208;induced defunctionalization pathway at high laser powers and prolonged irradiation times, which allows for the precise, patterned functional group &#8220;erasure&#8221; &#8211; a significant advantage over nonselective thermal annealing. Furthermore, we successfully demonstrate the successful readdressing and refunctionalization of these laser &#8220;erased&#8221; areas, enabling a complete &#8220;write&#8208;erase&#8208;rewrite&#8221; cycle. This work establishes a robust and highly adaptable platform for creating complex, mixed&#8208;functionalized graphene architectures with micrometer precision.

         <title>Photoswitchable Pseudorotaxanes with Dual Chromism and Tunable Fluorescence for Multilevel Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two photoswitchable pseudorotaxanes were constructed through supramolecular host&#8208;guest interactions, exhibiting distinct photochromic, vapochromic, and fluorescent properties in the solid state, which enables their application in multilevel information encryption systems.








Abstract
The design and construction of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) displaying distinct physical/chemical properties under different states is highly desirable due to their multifunctional applications. Herein, we report a photoswitchable pseudorotaxane system constructed through host&#160;&#8722;&#160;guest interactions between a vinyl&#8208;bipyridinium axle and cucurbit[7]uril (Q[7]) macrocycle. Upon light irradiation, the [3]pseudorotaxane E&#8208;G2+@Q[7]2 in aqueous solution undergoes E&#8594;Z photoisomerization, converting to the [2]pseudorotaxane Z&#8208;G2+@Q[7], where Q[7] selectively encircles the central Z&#8208;vinyl&#8208;bipyridinium unit. Notably, E&#8208;G2+@Q[7]2 displays dual photochromic and vapochromic (NH3) activity, whereas Z&#8208;G2+@Q[7] is optically and vapor&#8208;responsively inert. Additionally, both E&#8208;G2+@Q[7]2 and Z&#8208;G2+@Q[7] exhibit distinct solid&#8208;state fluorescence emissions due to macrocyclic confinement effects. By leveraging these stimuli&#8208;responsive properties, we developed a multilevel information encryption system with three decryption states controlled by wavelength&#8208;specific irradiation (365&#160;nm, 430&#160;nm, or xenon lamp), enabling programmable message display via fluorescence and color changes. This work provides a paradigm for designing smart materials with integrated photoswitching, chromic, and fluorescent functionalities for advanced security applications.

         <title>Green Carbon Fiber Modification for Structural Battery: the Effect of Treatment Parameters on Structural Battery Body Strength</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops an eco&#8208;friendly method to enhance the mechanical properties of carbon fiber reinforced composites for structural batteries. Hydrogen peroxide&#8208;based oxidation is optimized by varying concentration, temperature, and time, achieving effective interfacial adhesion without damaging fibers. FTIR, XPS, and SEM confirm functionalization and uniform surface roughness, while tensile tests show &#8764;80% strength improvement under 30 wt% H2O2 at 60 &#176;C for 45 min. The approach reduces environmental impact and supports multifunctional, lightweight composites for electric vehicle and aerospace applications.








Abstract
Batteries and environmental processes are essential for the progress of contemporary technology from two distinct considering a sustainable future. Environmental processes aim for minimizing material and energy usage while regulating systems do not release dangerous gasses. The presented work demonstrates the modification of carbon fiber (CF) to enhance the strength of the outer case of structural batteries, a novel form of battery. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), an eco&#8208;friendly compound, has been utilized for this purpose. The strength of the carbon fiber enhances with the formation of the interface. The experimental results indicate that carbon fibers treated in a 30&#160;wt.% H2O2 solution at 60 &#176;C for 45 minutes exhibited an 80% enhancement in strength than pristine CF and a 35% improvement relative to the desized CF.

         <title>Synthesis of a Functionalized Bicyclo[3.2.1]Octane: A Common Subunit to Kauranes, Grayananes, and Gibberellanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed account on the synthesis of a bicyclo[3.2.1]octane scaffold, common to the kaurane, grayanane, and gibberellane diterpenoid families, is reported. Our original strategy relying on a 1,4&#8208;sila&#8208;Prins cyclization proved unsuccessful. Learning from that, we designed an alternative strategy relying on ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM), which ultimately led to the desired compound in 8 steps.








Abstract
Kauranes, grayananes, and gibberellanes are three important diterpenoid families. These natural products all share a bicyclo[3.2.1]octane skeleton, with oxidation at very specific positions. In this manuscript, we describe the synthesis of a bicyclo[3.2.1]octane building block, which could serve as a potential intermediate for the synthesis of natural products from these three families. A first approach relying on a 1,4&#8208;sila&#8208;Prins cyclization was first explored, which required the selective functionalization of dihydrocarvone (via C&#9472;H activation and selective oxidation). This strategy resulted in a dead end when a 1,2&#8208;cyclization product was obtained. An alternative strategy relying on ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) allowed to successfully achieve the synthesis of the desired scaffold in 8 steps from cyclohexenone.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Doped Copper Oxide Nanorods for Efficient Biomass Electro&#8208;Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we have demonstrated that Ni doping improved the activity of HMFOR by optimizing the electronic structure of Cu sites and enhancing the adsorption of HMF. The Ni&#8208;CuOx exhibits a large current density of 199.7 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.4 V, which is 2.8&#8208;fold higher than that of pure CuOx. Moreover, it achieves a high FDCA yield of 90.1% and a Faraday efficiency of 98.5%.








Abstract
Cu&#8208;based catalysts are regarded as promising materials for the electro&#8208;oxidation of biomass. However, developing effective strategies to improve the intrinsic activity of Cu&#8208;based catalysts is still challenging and rarely reported. Herein, we synthesized a nickel&#8208;doped copper oxide catalyst (Ni&#8208;CuOx) for 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) electro&#8208;oxidation to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). The Ni&#8208;CuOx exhibited a large current density of 199.7&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.4&#160;V, which is 2.8&#8208;fold higher than that of pure CuOx, and exceeds most of the reported Cu&#8208;based catalysts. Moreover, the Ni&#8208;CuOx also showed high FDCA yield (90.1%) and Faradaic efficiency (98.5%). Physical characterizations and electrochemical analyses demonstrated that Ni doping optimizes the electronic structure of Cu sites, and promoting the adsorption of HMF, contributing to enhanced electrocatalytic activity. This work provides insights into the rational design of copper&#8208;based catalysts for biomass electro&#8208;oxidation.

         <title>Developing High&#8208;Rate Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries with Zn&#8208;Doped V10O24&#183;12H2O Cathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Zinc doping into V10O24&#183;12H2O enhances its electronic conductivity and expands the interlayer spacing, thereby enabling superior rate capability and prolonged durability as a cathode for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) have garnered attention as a cost&#8208;effective and safer alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, developing suitable cathode materials which can reversibly host Zn2&#160;+&#160;ions remains a challenge. Herein we explore the effect of zinc doping into hydrothermally synthesized V10O24.12H2O (ZVO) and demonstrate that such doping enhances electronic conductivity and structural stability, leading to improved rate capability and cycling performance of ZVO as a cathode material for AZIBs. The effect of zinc doping in the V10O24.12H2O as a ZIB cathode has not been previously explored. The ZVO materials had a bundled rod&#8208;like morphology with a zinc content of 1.3% and an average oxidation state of 4.86 for the vanadium. DFT calculations further validate that Zn doping to the pristine V10O24&#160;is thermodynamically favorable, which also improves the electronic conductivity of the ZVO. As a result, the Zn//ZVO cell exhibited superior specific capacity and improved rate performance over the pristine V10O24.12H2O (VO) electrode, with a high specific capacity of 359 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g and sustained 121 mAh/g at 5 A/g. The Zn//ZVO cell also showed commendable cycle stability with 90 mAh/g capacity retention over 1110 cycles, which was equivalent to the starting capacity of the pristine VO cathode.

&lt;p&gt;Zinc doping into V10O24&#183;12H2O enhances its electronic conductivity and expands the interlayer spacing, thereby enabling superior rate capability and prolonged durability as a cathode for aqueous zinc-ion batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) have garnered attention as a cost-effective and safer alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, developing suitable cathode materials which can reversibly host Zn2&#160;+&#160;ions remains a challenge. Herein we explore the effect of zinc doping into hydrothermally synthesized V&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;.12H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (ZVO) and demonstrate that such doping enhances electronic conductivity and structural stability, leading to improved rate capability and cycling performance of ZVO as a cathode material for AZIBs. The effect of zinc doping in the V&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;.12H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O as a ZIB cathode has not been previously explored. The ZVO materials had a bundled rod-like morphology with a zinc content of 1.3% and an average oxidation state of 4.86 for the vanadium. DFT calculations further validate that Zn doping to the pristine V&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;is thermodynamically favorable, which also improves the electronic conductivity of the ZVO. As a result, the Zn//ZVO cell exhibited superior specific capacity and improved rate performance over the pristine V&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;.12H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (VO) electrode, with a high specific capacity of 359 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g and sustained 121 mAh/g at 5 A/g. The Zn//ZVO cell also showed commendable cycle stability with 90 mAh/g capacity retention over 1110 cycles, which was equivalent to the starting capacity of the pristine VO cathode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cage Amine Superbases: Synthesis and Studies of Nona(ethylene)Hexamine and Dodeka(ethylene)Octamine</title>

         <dc:description>
The strongest known cage&#8208;amine bases, nona(ethylene)hexamine and dodeka(ethylene)octamine have been prepared and characterized using experimental and theoretical methods.








Abstract
The cage&#8208;amine molecules nona(ethylene)hexamine and dodeka(ethylene)octamine, have been prepared by coupling 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane (tacn) or 1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane (cyclen) to the corresponding &#945;&#8208;chloroacetamide derivatives of these macrocycles. The formed tri&#8208; or tetra&#8208;amide cryptands were then reduced to the corresponding hexamine and octamine with borane. In all cases, the amide and amine cryptands were isolated as protonated ammonium salts, with the proton oriented to the inside of the cage molecules (i.e., endohedral). Deprotonation studies on the hexamine and octamine showed the encapsulated protons are highly inert, with no evidence of deprotonation or deuterium exchange. Detailed theoretical studies predict very high proton affinity and basicity of 1118.7 and 1086.7&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1, respectively, for dodeka(ethylene)octamine, and 1108.3 and 1083.7&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1, respectively, for nona(ethylene)hexamine, placing them among the strongest amine bases ever prepared and firmly within the realm of &#8220;superbases&#8221;.

         <title>Reactivity of a Substituted Aryloxenium Cation with a Triplet Ground State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A substituted aryloxenium cation with a triplet electronic ground state is not a strong electrophile like the analogous singlet aryloxenium cations. It undergoes only radical reactions that are remarkably fast for a delocalized &#960;&#8208;type biradical.








Abstract
Aryloxenium cations contain a formally positively charged, monovalent oxygen atom. In spite of this unusual structural element, they are key intermediates in many important processes, such as biological oxidation reactions and the industrial generation of thermoplastics. However, the development of new applications is hindered by the lack of knowledge on their fundamental chemical properties. While most past studies have focused on aryloxenium cations with singlet electronic ground states, minor structural modifications can produce aryloxenium cations that have a triplet ground state. Unfortunately, examination of the reactivity of triplet aryloxenium cations is limited to just two studies that reported the detection of H atom abstraction from solvents by the same cation. A detailed kinetic reactivity study involving cyclohexane, allyl iodide, and dimethyl disulfide reagents is reported here for a substituted aryloxenium cation with a triplet electronic ground state, the 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyloxenium cation.

         <title>An Amino Acid&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Shrinking Supramolecular Bioactive Hydrogel &#8208; A Sustainable Platform for Wastewater Treatment and Water Purification</title>

Syneresis behavior of an amino acid (Fmoc&#8208;hPhe&#8208;OH, hF)&#8208;based bioactive hydrogel has been portrayed with the potential for purifying industrial wastewater through a sustainable and green platform.








Abstract
This study investigates the unique syneresis (self&#8208;shrinking) behavior of N&#8208;Terminally Fmoc&#8208;protected amino acid, Fmoc&#8208;hPhe&#8208;OH (Fmoc&#8208;homo&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine, abbreviated in this work as hF)&#8208;based hydrogel, and its potential in environmental remediation applications. Fmoc&#8208;hPhe&#8208;OH (hF) forms a hydrogel in 50&#160;mM phosphate buffer (PB) of pH 7.4. Interestingly, hF&#8208;based hydrogel shows syneresis behavior with controlled release of residual water from the hydrogel matrix. Moreover, this hydrogelator can form co&#8208;assembled hydrogels with various dyes, including Congo Red and Rhodamine B; natural water samples, including natural mud water and sea water; and heavy metal ions aqueous solutions, including CdII, PbII, and HgII separately in 50&#160;mM PB of pH 7.4. Interestingly, after 2 to 3 hours for shake gel and 5&#8211;6 hours for nonshake gel, the released waters have been tested and it has been found that these co&#8208;assembled hydrogels are capable of retaining almost all the contaminants within the shrink hydrogels matrix and releasing almost pure water along with the presence of hydrogel nanofibers. Syneresis is augmented to purify the contaminated water with dyes, mud, dissolved salts, and toxic heavy metal ions. These co&#8208;assembled hydrogels, leading to distinct structural and functional changes, which have been characterized by using Fourier&#8208;Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X&#8208;ray Diffraction (XRD), and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE&#8208;SEM), suggesting various supramolecular interactions including &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic interactions are responsible for stable hydrogelations. The rheological study evaluates the hydrogel's mechanical and thixotropic properties and spectroscopic techniques, including UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy, to monitor structural transition. This novel class of amino acid&#8208;based hydrogel shows antibacterial activity against both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, likely through membrane&#8208;disruptive mechanisms, and also shows promising antioxidant properties. The native hF hydrogel is biocompatible and shows anticancer activity toward the pancreatic cancer cell line. The research finding bestows the biomedically relevant hydrogel's potential use in green and sustainable environmental remediation.

         <title>High Shear Conversion of Elemental Bismuth in Water Under Air to 2D Bismuth Oxycarbonate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Powdered elemental bismuth in water forms 2D bismuth oxycarbonate nanosheets under high shear in a rapidly rotating tube housed in a vortex fluidic device, without the need of surfactants or other excipients, with uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide.








Abstract
2D Bismuth oxycarbonate (2D BOC) nanosheets have a unique layered structure with many applications, including capture and reduction of carbon dioxide. Processing powdered elemental bismuth in water under ambient air conditions using a vortex fluidic device (VFD) results in the formation of 2D BOC without the need of surfactants or other excipients. The induced high shear mechanical energy in the form of micron/submicron topological typhoon like spinning top (ST) fluid flow drives the conversion, which we propose initially melts the metal particles which are spontaneously oxidised at the liquid&#8208;quartz tube interface to form 2D bismuth oxide (Bi2O3). Then it reacts with atmospheric CO2 to form 2D BOC. These sheets, &#8804; 15.7&#160;nm thick, are in the orthorhombic phase with a lattice spacing of 0.29&#160;nm, which is converted to Bi2O3 monoclinic phase as an exothermic process at 269 &#176;C.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Aryl Iodides with Sulfinamide Reagents for the Construction of Sulfinamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel sulfinamide reagent was developed that enables the one&#8208;step synthesis of sulfinamides through palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling with aryl iodides.








Abstract
A novel sulfinamide reagent was developed that enables the one&#8208;step installation of sulfinamides through palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling with aryl iodides. This method offers distinct advantages, including the use of readily available starting materials and broad substrate compatibility. Moreover, the strategy was successfully extended to the synthesis of complex functional molecules. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the key intermediate undergoes base&#8208;promoted retro&#8208;Michael addition to afford the target product.

         <title>Coordination&#8208;Driven Orthogonal Ligand Pairings through Dual Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding/&#960;&#8208;&#960; Interaction Complementarity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of bidentate ligands for square&#8208;planar Pd(II) complexes were developed, each with hydrogen&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;stacking domains that are complementary to only one other ligand. The bis&#8208;bidentate complexes form orthogonally to one another with high fidelity, but only when both interaction types are exploited in tandem.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;layered and orthogonal recognition is an excellent route to controlled molecular complexity. Here we report a series of heteroleptic complexes where two ligands pair together at a palladium(II) metal centre in complementary fashion and with orthogonality to others pairs. This complementarity is driven in part through hydrogen&#8208;bonding acceptor or donor sites proximal to the coordination domain (either DD:AA or AD:DA). These interactions alone are insufficient to control ligand pairing identity and/or orientation&#8212;secondary &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions between electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor aromatic groups in the recognition domain combine with the hydrogen bonding to give high levels of complementarity. Importantly, the different heteroleptic complexes can be combined without significant scrambling or mismatching.

         <title>Optimization of CEST MRI Reporter Protein Design Using Cation&#8208;Pi Networks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel engineering approach can produce reporter proteins for cell and viral therapy tracking with unique magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signatures, detectable with chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST). We discover how cation&#8208;&#960; interactions between amino acid groups can help us fine&#8208;tune magnetic resonance properties for noninvasive, sensitive, and specific detection of protein reporters.








Abstract
Nucleic acid&#8208;based therapeutics, such as oncolytic virotherapy or gene therapy, would benefit greatly from a reporter gene that induces endogenous production of a protein biomarker to noninvasively track the delivery, persistence, and spread with imaging. Several chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) reporter proteins detectable by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been demonstrated to have high sensitivity. However, to date none can provide strong CEST contrast at a distinct resonance from that of endogenous proteins, limiting their specificity. We investigated proteins and peptides containing tyrosine (Tyr), tryptophan (Trp), and lysine (Lys) residues that demonstrate CEST contrast shifted far downfield (4&#8211;10&#160;ppm) from water. Although Tyr, Trp, and Lys exchangeable protons are typically not detectable under physiological conditions, those in our tested molecules are, having exchange rates of 400&#8211;2500 s&#8722;1. The large chemical shift dispersion and rapid exchange rates are attributed to unique hydrogen bonding and cation&#8208;&#960; network interactions. These discoveries set the stage for designing a stable reporter protein with high detection specificity and sensitivity that can facilitate the in vivo monitoring of viral and gene therapies using MRI.

         <title>LMCT&#8208;Driven Iron Photocatalysis: Mechanistic Insights and Synthetic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
LMCT&#8208;driven iron photocatalysis: This review discusses recent developments in ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT)&#8208;driven iron photocatalysis, emphasizing mechanistic insights and diverse synthetic applications. By classifying Fe(III)&#8211;L bond homolysis pathways, it highlights iron's potential as a sustainable alternative to precious metals for radical&#8208;mediated reactions under mild conditions.








Abstract
Iron&#8208;based photocatalysis has emerged as a sustainable and versatile platform for facilitating a wide range of chemical transformations, offering an appealing alternative to precious metal photocatalysts. Among the various activation modes, ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT)&#8208;driven homolysis of Fe(III)&#8211;L(ligand) bonds has garnered considerable attention due to its ability to generate reactive radical species under mild conditions, without requiring the matching of substrates&#8217; redox potentials. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of recent developments in LMCT&#8208;driven iron photocatalysis, with a particular focus on both mechanistic insights and synthetic applications published in the last five years. We classify Fe(III)&#8211;L homolysis into four major categories based on the nature of the coordinated ligand: halides, carboxylates, alkoxides, and azide. For a few cases, mechanistic understanding derived from spectroscopic studies, computational modeling, and kinetic investigations is discussed in more detail. We further highlight the expanding repertoire of synthetic transformations enabled by LMCT&#8208;driven iron photocatalysis, including C&#9472;H functionalization, alkene functionalization, cross&#8208;coupling, oxidation, and radical&#8208;mediated bond formation. Finally, we provide future perspectives on the continued development of LMCT&#8208;based iron photocatalysis as a broadly applicable platform for sustainable organic synthesis. This review aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers interested in leveraging the full potential of LMCT&#8208;mediated iron photocatalysis in modern organic chemistry.

This study reports the first Ru&#8208;catalyzed ATH of &#945;&#8208;iminophosphonates, enabling the efficient synthesis of chiral &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates. Both acyclic and cyclic substrates are converted in high yields (up to 97%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to&#160;&gt;99:1), offering a practical alternative to conventional AH for accessing phosphorus&#8208;containing chiral amines.








Abstract
A novel Ru&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) strategy has been developed for the efficient synthesis of valuable chiral &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates from readily available &#945;&#8208;iminophosphonates. This method enables the conversion of both acyclic and cyclic substrates in high yields (up to 97%) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to&#160;&gt;99:1), providing a practical entry to phosphorus&#8208;containing chiral amines. Notably, this is the first reported application of ATH to &#945;&#8208;iminophosphonates, offering a robust and operationally convenient alternative to conventional asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) approaches.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discussed here the synthesis and developments for BNCT reagents i.e amino acids containing Boron. Furthermore, this review discusses the applications of boronated amino acids in treating different cancer cells.








Abstract
One of the most difficult issues facing humanity today is the treatment of cancer. A binary cancer treatment called boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) works especially well for high&#8208;grade gliomas and metastatic brain malignancies. Due to their preferential absorption by developing tumor cells, boronated amino acids have drawn a lot of attention among the several boron&#8208;containing compounds utilized as BNCT agents. In the first section of this review, the fundamental ideas of BNCT are briefly presented. In the remaining sections, we present a thorough analysis and synthesis of several boronated amino acids using distinct techniques. This article summarizes the therapeutic prospects of boron delivery agents and offers a critical analysis of them from the perspectives of nuclear medicine doctors and medicinal chemists.

Molecular cyclization strategy for improving the luminescent performances of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; probes









Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) deposition, imposing significant social and economic burdens globally. Despite extensive efforts have been devoted to developing fluorescent probes for A&#946; imaging, further improving the luminescent efficiency of prevailing probes still remains a significant challenge. Herein, we investigated the inner mechanism of constructing high&#8211;efficient A&#946; probes via a structural cyclization strategy. Based on a typical donor&#8208;acceptor A&#946; probe (Pro1), three cyclized derivatives (Pro2&#8208;Pro4) are designed by incorporating dimethylene, trimethylene, and ethyleneoxy groups into the &#960;&#8208;conjugated bridge. It is found that all compounds exhibit high specificity at various binding sites within the A&#946; fibril, while Pro4 features preferable hydrogen bond interaction with the fibril. Notably, a significant enhanced fluorescence quantum efficiency is demonstrated in the ethyleneoxy&#8208;contained counterpart, primarily due to the decreased nonradiative decay arising from the reduced nonadiabatic electronic coupling, electron&#8208;vibration coupling, and vibrational modes mixing. Consequently, the newly designed compound Pro4 achieves both red&#8208;shifted emission and optimal luminescent efficiency, making it a promising candidate for A&#946; imaging. These findings highlight the feasibility of structural cyclization as an effective approach to improve luminescent efficiency in A&#946;&#8208;targeted probes, contributing to the development of fluorescent imaging techniques for early AD diagnosis.

&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by &#946;-amyloid (A&#946;) deposition, imposing significant social and economic burdens globally. Despite extensive efforts have been devoted to developing fluorescent probes for A&#946; imaging, further improving the luminescent efficiency of prevailing probes still remains a significant challenge. Herein, we investigated the inner mechanism of constructing high&#8211;efficient A&#946; probes via a structural cyclization strategy. Based on a typical donor-acceptor A&#946; probe (Pro1), three cyclized derivatives (Pro2-Pro4) are designed by incorporating dimethylene, trimethylene, and ethyleneoxy groups into the &#960;-conjugated bridge. It is found that all compounds exhibit high specificity at various binding sites within the A&#946; fibril, while Pro4 features preferable hydrogen bond interaction with the fibril. Notably, a significant enhanced fluorescence quantum efficiency is demonstrated in the ethyleneoxy-contained counterpart, primarily due to the decreased nonradiative decay arising from the reduced nonadiabatic electronic coupling, electron-vibration coupling, and vibrational modes mixing.

         <title>Direct and Indirect Effects of Fe&#8208;Incorporation in Nickel(oxy)hydroxide Materials for the Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction &#8208; Employing Constant pH/U Models for Deeper Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the effect of iron incorporation in nickel oxide electrocatalysts for water oxidation is analyzed using electronic structure methods with implicit solvation and constant pH/potential methods. The location and amount of iron influences not only the involved deprotonation and oxidation processes but also the mechanism and nature of species in the O&#8211;O coupling reaction.








Abstract
In this study, we seek to deepen the understanding of the Fe effect in Ni&#8208;oxyhydroxide&#8208;mediated oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysis in alkaline conditions, where extremely small amounts of Fe can have a dramatic impact on catalytic performance. For this purpose, Density Functional Theory (DFT) electronic structure calculations with implicit solvation description is employed in a constant pH/potential simulation framework. Nanoparticle models are considered for the nickel&#8208;based oxyhydroxide material with different degrees of Fe incorporation, and the pH/U&#8208;dependent interface structure is studied. It can be seen that Fe incorporation influences the total extent of oxidation and deprotonation, stabilizing oxo species at early states of the reaction even at lower potentials.&#160;
From the resting state models, we derive reaction energy profiles and O&#8208;O coupling barriers for three different OER mechanisms: water nucleophilic attack (WNA), intramolecular coupling (IMC), and the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM). Each species is derived taking into account explicit change in protonation state and charge as a function of pH and potential. The results suggest direct and indirect modifications in Ni&#8208;oxyhydroxide reactivity and in the preferred OER pathway, which changes with Ni/Fe ratio. The results we present imply that synergy between Ni and Fe acid&#8208;base and redox properties is essential for efficient water oxidation/deprotonation and O&#8208;O bond&#160;formation.

         <title>Glycosyl Radical&#8208;Based, 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;Selective Synthesis of C&#8208;Aryl Glycosides from Glycals Enabled by Photoredox PCET/Nickel&#8208;Dual Catalysis</title>

We report a glycosyl radical&#8208;based, 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;selective synthesis of C&#8208;aryl glycosides of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8208;amino&#8208;sugars (DASs) from glycals via photoredox PCET/Ni dual catalysis. Mechanistic studies indicate that glycosyl radical formation involves the generation of an N&#8208;radical through a PCET process, followed by its addition to the glycal. This protocol features: a) the use of an inexpensive organic photosensitizer and readily available glycals and aryl bromides; b) good functional group tolerance for both aryl bromides and glycal substrates; c) excellent diastereoselectivity, with exclusive formation of the 1,2&#8208;trans C&#8208;glycosides in all cases. Furthermore, the reaction could be conducted on gram&#8208;scale and is suitable for the late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecule.

Fe3+&#160;and H+&#160;triggered the ring opening of the spirolactam in Rhodamine moiety and &#8220;Turn&#8208;on&#8221; lysosomal&#8208;targeted fluorescence probe. It can be used for Fe3+&#160;detection, the response of the pH microenvironment in lysosomes, and monitoring intragastric acidity.








Abstract
The long&#8208;term visualization of intracellular Fe3+ dynamics and lysosomal activity is crucial for investigating the physiological roles and functions of lysosomes during the growth of organisms. The lysosome&#8208;targeted fluorescent probe (RBH&#8208;EdC), derived from rhodamine&#8208;nucleoside conjugates, demonstrates a sophisticated dual&#8208;activation design: one is Fe3&#8314; response, triggering spirolactam ring&#8208;opening to form xanthine structures, resulting in&#160;&#8805;&#160;1000&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement with visible colorimetric transition (colorless&#8594;pink). Another is pH sensitivity, demonstrating protonation&#8208;dependent fluorescence amplification at the dC at site N3 (pKa&#160;=&#160;2.9), achieving a 30&#8208;fold intensity increase at pH 2.5 within the 1.0&#8211;5.0 range. Remarkably, the RBH&#8208;EdC/Fe3&#8314; complex showed a further significant 20&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement at pH 3.0. This Fe3&#8314;/H&#8314; co&#8208;activated &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; system provides exceptional signal amplification for both in vitro and in vivo applications, enabling precise exploration of lysosome&#8208;related biological processes, including the response of the pH microenvironment, real&#8208;time monitoring of lysosomal pH dynamics, in situ measurement of gastric acidity levels, and potential application in gastric ulcer diagnostics.

The lysosome-targeted fluorescent probe (RBH-EdC), derived from rhodamine-nucleoside conjugates, demonstrates a sophisticated dual-activation design: one is Fe&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; response, triggering spirolactam ring-opening to form xanthine structures, resulting in&#160;&#8805;&#160;1000-fold fluorescence enhancement with visible colorimetric transition (colorless&#8594;pink). Another is pH sensitivity, demonstrating protonation-dependent fluorescence amplification at the dC at site N3 (pK&lt;sub&gt;a&#160;&lt;/sub&gt;=&#160;2.9), achieving a 30-fold intensity increase at pH 2.5 within the 1.0&#8211;5.0 range. Remarkably, the RBH-EdC/Fe&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; complex showed a further significant 20-fold fluorescence enhancement at pH 3.0. This Fe&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314;/H&#8314; co-activated &#8220;turn-on&#8221; system provides exceptional signal amplification for both in vitro and in vivo applications, enabling precise exploration of lysosome-related biological processes, including the response of the pH microenvironment, real-time monitoring of lysosomal pH dynamics, in situ measurement of gastric acidity levels, and potential application in gastric ulcer diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regioselective Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Asymmetric Cyclic Dimers for Polyester&#8208;Based Alternating Copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights advances in regioselective ROP of asymmetric cyclic di(thio)esters and cyclic(ester&#8208;amide)s for synthesizing polyester&#8208;based alternating copolymers. It covers catalyst optimization, mechanistic insights, regioselectivity quantification, and structure&#8208;property relationships of alternating copolymers. The challenges and future directions toward chemical circularity are also discussed.








Abstract
Sequence&#8208;controlled polyester&#8208;based alternating copolymers have attracted significant interest due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, closed&#8208;loop recyclability, and hydrolytic degradability, offering broad potential in biomedical and sustainable materials. Among the available strategies, regioselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of asymmetric cyclic di(thio)esters and cyclic(ester&#8208;amide)s has emerged as a promising approach for constructing alternating copolymers with precise sequence&#8208; and stereo&#8208;control, structural diversity, and tunable properties. This review classifies asymmetric cyclic monomers into two categories: (1) monomers with two aliphatic ester bonds, where regioselectivity is mainly dictated by steric differences and typically requires tailored metal catalysts; and (2) monomers with chemically distinct reactive sites (e.g., phenolic ester, thioester, or amide vs. aliphatic ester), which enable near&#8208;perfect regioselectivity using simple catalysts. Recent progress in the synthesis of alternating aliphatic copolyesters, poly(phenolic&#8208;alt&#8208;aliphatic ester)s, poly(ester&#8208;alt&#8208;thioester)s, and poly(ester&#8208;alt&#8208;amide)s is highlighted, emphasizing their enhanced degradability, recyclability, and mechanical performance. Key advances in catalyst optimization, mechanistic understanding, quantification of regioselectivity, and the structure&#8208;property relationships of alternating copolymers are summarized. Finally, future directions are discussed, including rational catalyst design, expansion to new monomer architectures, and the systematic evaluation of how regioselectivity governs alternating copolymer properties.

         <title>In Pursuit of Low Energy Phosphorescence: Late Metal Coordination Complexes of the Planar, &#960;&#8208;extended Bipyridyl Ligand 6,6&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;Biphenanthridine</title>

Abstract
The coordination chemistry of the planar, doubly &#960;&#8208;extended bipyridine analog, 6,6&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;biphenanthridine (p&#8208;biphe), is presented. The phenanthridine units in p&#8208;biphe are fused together at the 6&#8208; and 7&#8208; positions, and the resulting rigid ligand is compared with the more flexible parent &#8220;biphe&#8221; fused only at the 6&#8208;positions. p&#8208;Biphe is intensely fluorescent in solution with a much higher quantum yield, but, unlike biphe, at 77&#160;K the fluorescence is not accompanied by any significant phosphorescence. Two four&#8208;coordinate Cu(I) complexes and pseudo&#8208;octahedral Ru(II) and Ir(III) complexes are described: [Cu(p&#8208;biphe)2]+, [(P^P)Cu(p&#8208;biphe)]+, [Ru(bpy)2(p&#8208;biphe)]2+, and [Ir(ppy)2(p&#8208;biphe)]+, isolated as PF6 salts (P^P&#160; = &#160;4,5&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene; bpy&#160;=&#160;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine; ppy&#160;=&#160;2&#8208;phenylpyridine). The complexes are strongly coloured due to intense low&#8208;energy absorption to charge&#8208;transfer excited states based on TDDFT calculations. The acceptor nature of the p&#8208;biphe ligand is clear from multiple reduction events observed electrochemically. The Ir(III) complex displays remarkably low&#8208;energy phosphorescence (&#955;max = 812&#160;nm) in solution at room temperature with a vibrational progression evident extending into the near IR, with no contamination from visible light emission. While the heteroleptic Cu(I) complex is phosphorescent at 77&#160;K, no emission is detectable from [Cu(p&#8208;biphe)2]+ or [Ru(bpy)2(p&#8208;biphe)]2+, likely due to competitive nonradiative decay.

         <title>Coronene Bisimide as a Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Triplet&#8208;Triplet Energy Transfer Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coronene bisimide (CBI) with its efficient intersystem crossing&#160;was used as a visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing photosensitizer. Different reactions, including cycloadditions and oxidations, were demonstrated via triplet&#8208;energy transfer from CBI.








Abstract
Photosensitization has emerged as a versatile tool to facilitate access to excited states under mild conditions, allowing for efficient and selective photochemical transformations. Herein, we report a very simple molecule, coronene bisimide (CBI), as a potent visible&#8208;light photosensitizer featuring a high extinction coefficient with a broadband absorption spanning from ultraviolet to green region of the visible spectrum, along with a long&#8208;lived triplet state generated via efficient intersystem crossing (ISC). Utilizing the triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer (TTEnT) strategy, CBI catalyzes diverse reactions under green light irradiation. Through this, we propose CBIs as a new class of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free visible&#8208;light sensitizers overcoming the limitations of conventional sensitizers, such as low extinction coefficient in the visible regime, short triplet&#8208;state lifetimes, and high toxicity, by relying on heavy atoms.

         <dc:description>
An integrative data&#8208;driven approach leveraging AI, computations, and robotic experimentation enables accelerated discovery of polyoxometalates, bridging synthetic unpredictability and paving the way for rational, predictive, and functional cluster chemistry.








Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are nanoscale, structurally versatile metal&#8211;oxo clusters with emerging applications in sustainability, energy, nanoelectronics, and life science technologies. Owing to their structural complexity, some all&#8208;inorganic POMs are often perceived as serendipitous outcomes from self&#8208;assembly processes, which poses challenges for scalable rational design. From this perspective, we therefore examine how the development of POM informatics and, more generally, data&#8208;driven POM exploration can pave the way for the molecular engineering of new POM&#8208;based materials targeting customized applications. In the process, we highlight recent successes in the digitalization of POM chemistry and outline which advanced technologies are necessary for progress in this promising area of&#160;research.

         <title>A Phosphorus(V)&#8208;Centered Porphyrin Having Redox&#8208; and Air&#8208;Stable Axial P&#8211;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorus&#8208;centered porphyrins are important functional dyes. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a phosphorus(V) porphyrin complex with hydrogen atoms as axial ligands (1+&#183;PF6&#8211;). 1+&#183;PF6&#8211; is air&#8208;stable. Cyclic voltammetry of 1+&#183;PF6&#8211; exhibits two reversible waves, which indicates sequential redox couples among cationic, neutral open&#8208;shell, and anionic species.








Abstract
Phosphorus(V)&#8208;centered porphyrins (P(V)&#8208;porphyrins) are an important class of functional dyes in many fields of research, and axial ligands on the phosphorus atom affect the electronic properties of P(V)&#8208;porphyrins and add functions. Herein, we report on the synthesis and characterization of a hitherto unknown P(V)&#8208;porphyrin having hydrogen atoms as axial ligands (1+&#183;PF6&#8211;, PF6&#8211; is a counter anion). Synthesis of 1+&#183;PF6&#8211; was achieved by treatment of dichloro&#8208;derivative (2+&#183;Cl&#8211;) with LiAlH4 followed by AgPF6 via hydride reduction accompanied by one&#8208;electron reduction and one&#8208;electron oxidation. The porphyrin core of 1+&#183;PF6&#8211; is nonplanar but considerably ruffled. The cyclic voltammogram of 1+&#183;PF6&#8211; exhibits two reversible waves, which indicates redox couples among 1+, neutral radical 1&#8226;, and 1&#8211;. Compound 1+&#183;PF6&#8211; is tolerant toward air despite its PH2 moiety due to the energetically low&#8208;lying HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and &#963;(P&#8211;H) orbitals.

         <title>Target&#8208;Triggered Self&#8208;Assembly of Peptides with Silver Nanoparticles for Electrochemical Biosensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we have designed and fabricated an electrochemical biosensor based on target&#8208;triggered self&#8208;assembly of peptides with silver nanoparticles. The results demonstrate that the biosensor exhibits high stability and specificity, with a detection limit of 0.42 fM. Moreover, the biosensor design is readily adaptable for detecting other biomarkers by simply modifying the cleavage sequence of one peptide.








Abstract
Peptides have great potential in the design and fabrication of biosensors because of their high specificity, multifunctionality, and relatively low cost. In this paper, we report an electrochemical biosensor leveraging multifunctional peptides and silver nanoparticles for integrated target recognition, self&#8208;assembly, and signal output. As a proof of concept, we chose granzyme B (GrB) as a model target. Specifically, when the target is present, the recognition peptide is cleaved, and the assembly peptide then anchors, exposing a positively charged sequence that attracts silver nanoparticles, thereby generating an electrochemical signal. The biosensor exhibits favorable analytical performance, with a linear detection range of 1 to 10000 fM and a remarkably low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.42 fM. Moreover, the biosensor has been successfully applied to the analysis of clinical samples, confirming its potential for clinical detection and application.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Tetrasubstituted Olefins from Internal Alkynes via Three&#8208;Component Reaction Using a Heterogeneous Organometallic Triptycene&#8208;Based Porous Palladium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the design, synthesis, and application of a hyper&#8208;crosslinked heterogeneous porous organic polymer (Pd@TP&#8208;DPPF) for the efficient and sustainable dicarbofunctionalization of internal alkynes through a straightforward three&#8208;component reaction. The strategy provides a highly trans&#8208;selective route to tetrasubstituted olefins, delivering excellent yields.








Abstract
In this work, we report the design, synthesis, and application of a hyper&#8208;crosslinked heterogeneous organometallic porous organic polymer (Pd@TP&#8208;DPPF) catalyst for the efficient and sustainable dicarbofunctionalization of internal alkynes via a facile three&#8208;component reaction. This strategy enables the highly trans&#8208;selective syntheses of tetrasubstituted olefins in excellent yields. The catalyst is constructed by integrating triptycene (TP) and 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (DPPF) into a robust palladium&#8208;based porous framework, resulting in a unique heterogeneous system that efficiently mediates the coupling of internal alkynes with readily available iodoarenes and aryl/methyl boronic acids. This methodology also offers a versatile strategy for the syntheses of complex and valuable trans&#8208;selective alkenylsilanes under mild conditions, with high atom economy. Mechanistic studies support a trans&#8208;selective transformation pathway facilitated by the cooperative role of the polymer support and the palladium center. Importantly, the Pd@TP&#8208;DPPF catalyst exhibits excellent recyclability, air/moisture stability, and operational simplicity, making it highly suitable for large&#8208;scale and environmentally conscious synthetic applications. This work not only addresses a long&#8208;standing challenge in the synthesis of highly substituted olefins but also exemplifies the principles of green chemistry through catalyst reusability, waste minimization, and efficient multicomponent transformation.

HydroTherm&#8208;Flow Smart Window (HTF Window): A Pioneering Integration of Thermochromic Hydrogels and Fe&#8208;Cr Redox Flow Batteries for Sustainable Building Energy Management. This study presents the HTF Window, the first&#8208;ever integration of thermochromic hydroxypropyl cellulose hydrogels with Fe&#8208;Cr redox flow batteries. It delivers three key functions: dynamic dual&#8208;band solar modulation covering visible and near&#8208;infrared ranges, high&#8208;efficiency energy storage, and adaptive thermal regulation&#8212;addressing inefficiencies in traditional building windows and standalone energy storage systems. The HTF Window has a four&#8208;layer structure. The outermost layer is indium tin oxide coated glass that acts as a transparent heater. Next is a hydroxypropyl cellulose hydrogel layer enabling ultrafast optical switching, with visible transmittance dropping from 30% to less than 2% in 5 seconds. The middle layer is a microfluidic electrolyte channel that handles energy storage and forms a thermal coupling system. The innermost layer is glass for sealing and mechanical support. This design cuts the spatial footprint of Fe&#8208;Cr redox flow batteries by 66%. Performance tests show the HTF Window reaches 77% energy efficiency, 13% higher than conventional Fe&#8208;Cr redox flow batteries. It also boosts ionic conductivity by 30% via hydrogel ion highways, lowers the solar heat gain coefficient by 40%, and reduces annual heating, ventilation, and air conditioning energy consumption by 25%. Molecular dynamics simulations uncover that chloride ion networks and encapsulation structures in the hydrogel&#8208;electrolyte interface enhance battery discharge capacity. Cost and environmental analysis reveals the HTF Window has 30% lower capital expenditure and reduces 20&#8208;year carbon emissions by 42% compared to conventional systems combining separate windows and standalone Fe&#8208;Cr redox flow batteries. With a projected lifespan of over 20 years, it serves as a scalable solution for net&#8208;zero buildings, linking sustainable infrastructure to global decarbonization goals.








Abstract
This study introduces the HydroTherm&#8208;Flow Smart Window (HTF Window), the first groundbreaking integration of thermochromic windows and Fe&#8208;Cr redox flow batteries (Fe&#8208;Cr RFBs), achieving dual functionalities of dynamic solar modulation&#8212;via dual&#8208;band (visible&#160;+&#160;near&#8208;infrared, NIR) modulation&#8212;and high&#8208;efficiency energy storage in a single component. Leveraging tunable hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) hydrogels, it enables ultrafast optical switching and autonomous nighttime opacity, overcoming the slow response and privacy limitations of conventional thermochromic systems. By repurposing the window as a compact electrolyte reservoir, it reduces the RFB spatial footprint while enhancing ionic conductivity by 30% via hydrogel &#8220;ion highways,&#8221; achieving 77% energy efficiency with a 40% reduction in the solar heat gain coefficient. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal interactions between hydrogels and electrolytes, where chloride ion networks and encapsulation structures enhance battery discharge capacity. Addressing intermittent renewable energy grids and global carbon neutrality goals, the HTF Window stores surplus solar/wind energy to balance building&#8208;grid demand, reduces annual heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) energy consumption by 25% across climates, and stabilizes electrolyte temperature via waste heat recovery to minimize thermal loads. With a projected 20&#160;+&#160;year lifespan, it offers a scalable, universal solution for net&#8208;zero buildings, bridging sustainable infrastructure and global decarbonization imperatives.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Fluorescence Turn&#8208;On Copper(II)&#8208;Probe for Nitric Oxide Detection: A Reductive Nitrosylation Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing a Cu(II)&#8208;probe for selective NO detection via a pH&#8208;responsive reductive nitrosylation approach showing fluorescence turn&#8208;on via displacement of nitrosylated ligand and reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I), and a detection limit of 1&#160;nM.








Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) is one of the crucial biological signaling molecules, yet achieving its selective and spatiotemporal detection in in&#8208;situ/invitro or biological systems at specific pH remains a significant challenge. Hence, a probe capable of directly detecting NO would be immensely valuable in understanding its reactivity and biological functions. Here, to develop a Cu(II)&#8208;based probe for selective NO detection, we synthesized a Cu(II)&#8208;complex (1) using a N3&#8208;tridentate ligand having a pendant dansyl fluorophore (L1) and evaluated it's NO reactivity under varying pH conditions. The binding of Cu(II) ion with ligand L1 to prepare 1 showed&#160;&gt;&#160;96% fluorescence quenching (fluorescence turn&#8208;off) compared to highly fluorescent free L1 (&#934; = 59%). Complex 1 did not react with NO in neutral or acidic medium; however, in the presence of onefold base (pH&#160;&#8805;&#160;9), it showed the reductive nitrosylation reaction, which resulted in the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) and ligand nitrosylation (L1&#8208;NO) with fluorescence turn&#8208;on. Studies performed using different reactive nitrogen /or oxygen species (RNS/ROS) suggest that probe 1 is highly selective toward NO with a detection limit of 1&#160;nM. For the first time, the base&#8208;catalyzed reductive nitrosylation of a Cu(II) complex resulted in the selective NO detection via fluorescence turn&#8208;on at pH&#160;&#8805;&#160;9 in methanol /or aqueous buffer medium. To understand the effect of secondary amine (&#9472;NH&#9472;) sites in the above reductive nitrosylation reaction, a Cu(II) complex (2) of the ligand (L2), having two different (&#9472;NH&#160;sites, was reacted with NO under various pH conditions. Surprisingly, 2 showed selective mono&#8208;N&#8208;nitrosylation of the amine site coordinated to Cu(II) ion with the reduction of Cu(II) in the presence of onefold OH&#8722;.

&lt;p&gt;Nitric oxide (NO) is one of the crucial biological signaling molecules, yet achieving its selective and spatiotemporal detection in in-situ/invitro or biological systems at specific pH remains a significant challenge.

         <title>Ester&#8208;Aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;Ketene Acetals with Solid&#8208;State Luminescence: AIEgens from Sequential Three&#8208;Component Desymmetrization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The difference in nucleophilicity of alcohols and S,N&#8208;ketene acetals sets the stage for the desymmetrizing acylation of diaroyl chlorides in a consecutive one&#8208;pot fashion in good yields. The ester&#8208;functionalized aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals are solid&#8208;state emitters that emit in solution only upon aggregation. Upon encapsulation in polystyrene nanoparticles, the fluorescence quantum yield enhances significantly.








Abstract
Di(hetero)aroyl dichlorides are desymmetrized upon sequential reaction with alcohols and 2&#8208;methyl N&#8208;benzyl thiazolium salts within the course of a one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component reaction yielding ester&#8208;substituted aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals under mild conditions in good yields. A prerequisite for the concise one&#8208;pot process is the different nucleophilicity of the alcohols and in situ generated S,N&#8208;ketene acetals. The resulting compounds are merocyanines with dominant charge&#8208;transfer absorption bands which are fluorescent in the solid state, but not in solution. In water/ethanol solvent mixtures of increasing water content, the water&#8208;insoluble dyes display typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics. The water fraction inducing AIE as well as the emission color, and fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;f) of the aggregated dyes can be controlled by the alcohol part of the ester moiety. Encapsulation into polystyrene nanoparticles can lead to a considerable increase of the fluorescence quantum yield &#934;f to 30% as shown for a representatively chosen dye revealing the highest &#934;f of 11% within the dye series in the water/ethanol mixtures and enabling the usage of these dyes as fluorescent reporters in aqueous environments.

4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide (NMI) as new fluorescence&#8208;responsive tool for HO&#8226; detection. Proof of concept illustrating that NMI selectively probes HO&#8226; produced by Cu&#8208;bound to A&#946;16 in presence of scavengers with an amplified response.








Abstract
Overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is involved in several diseases. Copper can be an efficient catalysts for ROS generation, as it was suggested for Cu bound to aberrant sites. Determination of rates and type of ROS production in more complex biological media is challenging and often only down&#8208;stream events can be monitored. Here, a selective detection of the hydroxyl radical (HO&#8226;), by a demethylation of 4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide (NMI) fluorescence probe by HO&#8226; resulting in &#8764;25&#8208;fold increase in quantum yield is reported. To investigate potential applications, the NMI was coupled to the Cu&#8208;binding domain of amyloid&#8208;beta (A&#946;16). This allowed the in situ fluorescence detection of HO&#8226; produced by A&#946;16 bound Cu due to the Fenton&#8208;type reaction. In a more complex medium with scavengers present including in cell culture conditions, the HO&#8226; produced in the bulk was not detected, in line with the short life&#8208;time of HO&#8226; in the presence of other molecules. Thus, this is a proof of concept to show that NMI reaction&#8208;based HO&#8226; detection could be a useful and a versatile tool to investigate in situ the role of HO&#8226; in a defined location such as Cu bound to A&#946;16 in biologically relevant complex systems

         <title>Rational Design of Cationic Silyl Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a family of selanyl&#8208;stabilized silyl cations is reported. Variations of the scaffold, the substituents at the silicon and the selenium atoms allow to adjust their Lewis acidity over a wide range. The Lewis acidity is quantified by the FBN method.








Abstract
The synthesis of a series of selanyl&#8208;stabilized cationic silyl Lewis acids with naphthalene or acenaphthalene scaffolds is described. The influence of scaffold modifications, substitution variations at the selanyl donor and at the silicon atom on the strengths of the silyl Lewis acid is evaluated using the p&#8208;fluorobenzonitrile (FBN) method. These simple variations of the principal structure allow to adjust the Lewis acidity of the cationic silyl Lewis acids from weak ones to examples that are significantly stronger than tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (BCF). The solid&#8208;state structure of the cationic FBN complex [11(FBN)]+ with an acenaphthene backbone and a pentafluorophenylselanyl donor provides evidence for the penta&#8208;coordination of the silicon atom in this complex, in agreement with the results of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies in solution. Finally, this study suggests that the FBN method is well suited to assess even very subtle differences in the strength of Lewis acids.

Herein, we describe the synthesis of a copper(II) nitrite complex which possesses unusual trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;O binding mode in trigonal bipyramidal geometry, and characterization through various physicochemical methods. The reduction of NO2&#8722; to release NO&#8226; was examined through PCET and OAT by using ferrocene and PPh3, respectively. DFT calculations revealed that the isomerization of trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;O to &#954;1&#8208;N binding mode is the key step for the OAT. The superiority of &#954;1&#8208;N binding mode in the OAT was further rationalized by molecular orbital analysis.








Abstract
Reduction of nitrite (NO2&#8722;) to nitric oxide (NO) serves important roles in NO&#8208;dependent signaling as well as in the broad nitrogen biogeochemical cycle. In biological system, copper&#8208;containing nitrite reductases (CuNiRs) are well known to bind a nitrite anion to mediate the nitrite reduction to release NO, of which the mechanism still requires further understanding. Herein, synthetic copper(II) nitrite complex with a rare binding mode, [CuII(iPr3&#8208;tren)(trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;ONO)]+ (2), is characterized physicochemically and examined in proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) and oxygen atom transfer (OAT) to release NO. For the first time to gain mechanistic insights into the trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;O binding copper(II) nitrite complex, detailed kinetic studies in company with theoretical calculations have been performed for oxidation of triphenylphosphine (PPh3), which shows that isomerization of trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;O to &#954;1&#8208;N binding mode is necessary to exert electrophilic OAT. The better reactivity of &#954;1&#8208;N binding mode is attributed to a fine orbital mixing of Cu&#8208;dz2 with highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of NO2&#8722;, thereby imposing much larger electron density on NO2&#8722; moiety. Thus, it is suggested that the reactivity of the copper(II) nitrite complex is conjunctly related to the binding mode of nitrite.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Assisted Controlled Radical Polymerization of Acrylates by Strategically Designed RuII&#8208;FeII Heterobimetallic Conjugate</title>

Cooperativity wins: Judiciously designed heterobimetallic conjugates of Ru(II) and Fe(II) metal centers have shown remarkable redox cooperativity to achieve living and well&#8208;defined acrylate polymers.








Abstract
Employing heterobimetallic complexes (HBCs) offers an exciting and powerful strategy for various catalytic applications. Here, we present an unorthodox synthetic route to synthesize a novel RuII&#8208;FeII heterobimetallic complex by implementing the strategy of &#8220;metalation with functionalization.&#8221; This complex utilizes a redox&#8208;assisted concerted strategy to facilitate the controlled radical polymerization (CRP) of acrylate monomers with significantly low catalyst loading. To understand the efficiency of the bimetallic catalyst over the other corresponding monometallic complexes, controlled polymerization experiments on acrylate monomers have been carried out. The redox cooperativity for efficient living CRP is very much pronounced and established in the RuII&#8208;FeII heterobimetallic dyad as evidenced by multiple orthogonal experimental results and the interesting rearrangement in the frontier molecular orbitals during catalysis steps. A plausible mechanistic pathway is proposed based on insights from electroparamagnetic resonance spectroscopy, cyclic voltametry, UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, rigid potential energy scans (PES), and the Fukui function. A modified atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) mechanism is offered by RuII&#8208;FeII conjugate, where redox&#8208;cooperativity and intramolecular electron transfer (IET) between the metal centers play a crucial role. This study investigates the potential of redox cooperativity in heterobimetallic systems, highlighting their efficacy as adaptable catalytic platforms.

         <title>Expanding Chemistry of Expanded Helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents recent advances in the chemistry of expanded helicenes, defined as helicenes containing linearly fused benzene rings, as novel aromatic compounds. This review begins with a summary of their structural classification, followed by the synthesis, structures, properties, and chiroptical performance of expanded helicenes of various shapes, such as hexagons, triangles, and rhombuses.








Abstract
Expanded helicenes are interesting compounds created by modifying the original helicene structure through the incorporation of linearly fused benzene rings, enlarging the helical diameter. Motivated by Tilley et&#160;al.&#8217;s report of a key expanded helicene structure in 2017, several research groups have synthesized such nonplanar aromatic compounds, aiming to explore their impressive structures, properties, and chiroptical performance. This review highlights recent advances in the expanded helicene chemistry through experimental and theoretical studies. The shape and length of helical structures depend on the number and combination of angularly and linearly fused benzene rings. Helical structures are classified using notations, and specific compounds corresponding to each structural form, namely, hexagonal, triangular, rhombic, or others, are introduced herein. As an extension of the molecular design, examples of nonhexagonal and heteroaromatic ring&#8208;embedded expanded helicenes are presented. Specifically, this review focuses on how the diameters, lengths, and turn numbers of helical structures depend on dynamic processes involving helical inversion and chiroptical properties (circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)). The characteristics and perspectives of this molecular design are also discussed.

         <title>Host Cavities Enhance the Photocatalytic Conversion of &#945;&#8208;Terpinene to Ascaridole Under Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BODIPY&#8208;functionalized host molecules are effective visible&#8208;light photosensitizers for the conversion of &#945;&#8208;terpinene to ascaridole in the presence of molecular oxygen, providing up to a 28&#8208;fold increase in the rate of conversion depending on the host employed.








Abstract
BODIPY&#8208;functionalized host molecules have been used as effective visible&#8208;light photosensitizers in the conversion of &#945;&#8208;terpinene to ascaridole in the presence of molecular oxygen. Host&#8208;guest interactions enhance the effective local concentration of the substrate and singlet oxygen generated by the photosensitizing host. This results in up to a 28&#8208;fold increase in the rate of conversion depending on the host employed. A tetramethyl BODIPY analogue, in which guest access to the host cavity is blocked, was also employed to confirm that the cavities do indeed enhance substrate turnover. Whilst the latter photocatalyst is more efficient due to the suppression of nonradiative relaxation pathways associated with rotation of the meso&#8208;phenyl substituent, the rate enhancement induced by host&#8208;guest binding is not present. Combined, this provides insight for the future design of enhanced systems.

         <title>An Unusual Activity of Conformationally Restricted Naphthalene Peri&#8208;Dichalcogenides in the Reduction of Nitro and Azide Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work highlights the unique ability of a conformationally restricted dichalcogenide to reduce nitro and azide groups to their corresponding amines under physiological conditions. The redox potential is strongly influenced by the nature of chalcogen atom substitution as well as the conformational rigidity of the dichalcogenide bond.








Abstract
Rigid and conformationally restricted dichalcogenides based on 1,8&#8208;naphthyl system have attracted significant interest as electron donors in charge transfer complexes and organic electrode materials. Recently, naphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;peri&#8208;diselenides have been shown to mimic the function of two major selenoenzymes&#160;&#8722;&#160;iodothyronine deiodinase (Dio) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) &#8722; mainly through two&#8208;electron redox processes involving deiodination of thyroid hormones and thiol&#8208;mediated reduction of hydrogen peroxide, respectively. Herein, we report that naphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;peri&#8208;dichalcogenides can mediate a six&#8208;electron reduction of organic nitro compounds to produce the corresponding primary amines at physiologically relevant temperature (37 &#176;C) using water as the solvent. The stepwise reduction process is highly dependent on the nature of the chalcogen atom present at the peri&#8208;positions of the naphthyl ring. While no reduction was observed with the disulfide, the selenenyl sulfide mediated a four&#8208;electron reduction of the nitro group to the corresponding hydroxylamine. The diselenide and ditelluride reduced the nitro groups all the way to amines through six&#8208;electron transfer. The diselenides also mediated the reduction of various aromatic azides to the corresponding primary amines.

Herein, we report that naphthalene-1,8-peri-dichalcogenides can mediate a six-electron reduction of organic nitro compounds to produce the corresponding primary amines at physiologically relevant temperature (37 &#176;C) using water as the solvent. The stepwise reduction process is highly dependent on the nature of the chalcogen atom present at the peri-positions of the naphthyl ring. While no reduction was observed with the disulfide, the selenenyl sulfide mediated a four-electron reduction of the nitro group to the corresponding hydroxylamine. The diselenide and ditelluride reduced the nitro groups all the way to amines through six-electron transfer. The diselenides also mediated the reduction of various aromatic azides to the corresponding primary amines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Multi&#8208;color fluorescent labels for detecting local water concentration at a selected cite of lipid&#8208;protein, protein&#8208;protein or protein&#8208;DNA complexes.








Abstract
5&#8208;Substituted 3&#8208;hydroxychromones (3&#8208;HCs) are challenging to synthesize but are of significant interest as fluorescent labels. This is primarily due to the pronounced modulation of their fluorescence by surrounding molecules, a consequence of the 5&#8208;substituent's proximity to the negative pole of the molecular dipole. The newly synthesized derivatives of 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)&#8208;4&#8208;oxo&#8208;4H&#8208;chromene&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylic acid exhibit unique fluorescence behaviors. Their color of emission is highly sensitive to the solvation environment and is strongly influenced by the nature of the functional group introduced at position 5. Notably, the fluorescence of acid demonstrates inhibition of ESIPT (excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer) in both neutral and H&#8208;bond donor solvents, a phenomenon not previously observed in 3&#8208;HCs. Furthermore, investigated dye stands out as the first 3&#8208;HC compound whose fluorescence responds to the H&#8208;bond acceptor capacity of the environment, particularly in mildly acidic conditions (below pH 6). In contrast, methyl ester and glycine amide of key acid are responsive to the H&#8208;bond donor properties of their surroundings&#8212;a feature especially relevant in biological systems, where local water concentration plays a critical role. Thus, the derivatives such as N&#8208;terminal or lysine&#8208;labeled peptides incorporating these dyes can serve as valuable tools for investigating peptide&#8208;DNA, peptide&#8208;lipid, and other biomolecular interactions for the selected location of peptide.

&lt;p&gt;5-Substituted 3-hydroxychromones (3-HCs) are challenging to synthesize but are of significant interest as fluorescent labels. This is primarily due to the pronounced modulation of their fluorescence by surrounding molecules, a consequence of the 5-substituent's proximity to the negative pole of the molecular dipole. The newly synthesized derivatives of 3-hydroxy-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4-oxo-4H-chromene-5-carboxylic acid exhibit unique fluorescence behaviors. Their color of emission is highly sensitive to the solvation environment and is strongly influenced by the nature of the functional group introduced at position &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;. Notably, the fluorescence of acid demonstrates inhibition of ESIPT (excited-state intramolecular proton transfer) in both neutral and H-bond donor solvents, a phenomenon not previously observed in 3-HCs. Furthermore, investigated dye stands out as the first 3-HC compound whose fluorescence responds to the H-bond acceptor capacity of the environment, particularly in mildly acidic conditions (below pH 6). In contrast, methyl ester and glycine amide of key acid are responsive to the H-bond donor properties of their surroundings&#8212;a feature especially relevant in biological systems, where local water concentration plays a critical role. Thus, the derivatives such as N-terminal or lysine-labeled peptides incorporating these dyes can serve as valuable tools for investigating peptide-DNA, peptide-lipid, and other biomolecular interactions for the selected location of peptide.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
