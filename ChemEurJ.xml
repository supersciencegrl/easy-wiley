Heterogeneous compounds (PS&#8208;1&#8722;PS&#8208;3) have further been studied by microwave plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and field emission scanning electron microscopy along with energy dispersive spectroscopy.

         <title>Design of New Bis(1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methane&#8208;Based Nitrogen Ligands: Synthesis and Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction between bis(1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methane derivatives and nBuLi and various aldehydes, yielded novel neutral ligand precursors incorporating alcohol functional groups. The resulting compounds exhibited distinct characteristics depending on the steric hindrance of the aldehyde employed. In instances where aromatic aldehydes were utilized, functionalization occurred at the methine group bridging both triazole rings. Conversely, the use of pivalic aldehyde prompted functionalization at the C5 position of the triazole ring. These compounds were subsequently employed as ligand precursors in the synthesis of organometallic aluminum and zinc complexes, yielding dinuclear complexes with high efficiency. The structural elucidation of all compounds was accomplished through spectroscopic methods and validated by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Preliminary catalytic investigations into the coupling reaction of cyclohexene oxide and CO2 revealed that aluminum and zinc complexes catalyzed the selective formation of polyether and polycarbonate materials, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Urea&#8208;Comprising Single Core Diketopyrrolopyrrole Derivatives: Exploring the Synthesis, Self&#8208;Assembly and Charge Transport Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We explore the synthesis, self&#8208;assembly and charge transport properties of two urea&#8208;containing single core thiophene&#8208;capped diketopyrrolopyrrole derivatives. The subtle differences in molecular design dictate the superior electronic properties of the lactam&#8208;functionalized analogue







Abstract
Supramolecular electronics exploits the distinctive features stemming from noncovalent interactions, guiding the self&#8208;assembly of molecules to craft materials endowed with customized electronic functionalities. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded materials, characterized by their capacity to establish dynamic and stable networks, introduce an extra dimension to the development of supramolecular electronic systems. This study presents a comparative analysis of two remarkably small semiconductors utilizing diketopyrrolopyrrole functionalized with urea units as hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs, strategically positioned at opposing ends of the conjugated core. We show how the subtle distinction in functionalization not only influences morphology and self&#8208;assembly dynamics via hydrogen&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking formation, but also holds significant consequences for ultimate charge transport properties. Our observations into the interplay of noncovalent interactions provide valuable insights and strategic pathways for the design of novel materials with enhanced electronic characteristics.

         <title>Layer by Layer Spraying Fabrication of Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Thin Film</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new kind of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) thin film were prepared by using aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) based ligand through a liquid&#8208;phase epitaxial (LPE) layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) spraying method, which is named AIE surface&#8208;coordinated metal&#8208;organic frameworks thin film (AIE&#8208;SURMOF). The obtained AIE&#8208;SURMOF has highly growth orientation and homogeneous thin film, showing strong fluorescent property. Furthermore, by loading chiral guest in the MOF pore, the formed chiral encapsulated AIE&#8208;SURMOF can clearly indicate obvious circularly polarized luminescence performance.







Abstract
The development of new metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) thin films is important for expanding their functions and applications. Herein, we first report a new kind of MOF thin film by using aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) dicarboxyl ligand through a liquid&#8208;phase epitaxial (LPE) layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) spraying method (named AIE surface&#8208;coordinated metal&#8208;organic frameworks thin film, AIE&#8208;SURMOF). The obtained AIE&#8208;SURMOF Zn4O(TPE)3 (ZnTPE) has highly growth orientation and homogeneous thin film, showing strong fluorescent property. Furthermore, by loading chiral guest in the MOF pore, the formed chiral encapsulated AIE&#8208;SURMOF can clearly indicate obvious circularly polarized luminescence performance with glum of 0.01. This study provides new MOF thin film and new strategy for expanding function and application of MOF materials.

         <title>From the Total Synthesis of Semi&#8211;Viriditoxin, Semi&#8211;Viriditoxic Acid and Dimeric Naphthopyranones to their Biological Activities in Burkitt B Cell Lymphoma</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various naphthopyranones were synthesized and tested for their cytotoxicity and apoptotic activity. The synthesis was carried out using two building blocks, which were prepared from enantiomerically pure oxiranes and methyl acetoacetate and then reacted with each other to form naphthopyranones. Monomeric and dimeric naphthopyranones were synthesized and then a structure&#8211;activity relationship study was carried out.







Abstract
Dimeric naphthopyranones are known to be biologically active, however, for the corresponding monomeric naphthopyranones this information is still elusive. Here the first enantioselective total synthesis of semi&#8208;viriditoxic acid as well as the synthesis of semi&#8211;viriditoxin and derivatives is reported. The key intermediate in the synthesis of naphthopyranones is an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#948;&#8208;lactone, which we synthesized in two different ways (Ghosez&#8211;cyclization and Grubbs ring&#8211;closing metathesis), while the domino&#8211;Michael&#8211;Dieckmann reaction of the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#948;&#8208;lactone with an orsellinic acid derivative is the key reaction. A structure&#8208;activity relationship study was performed measuring the cytotoxicity in Burkitt B lymphoma cells (Ramos). The dimeric structure was found to be crucial for biological activity: Only the dimeric naphthopyranones showed cytotoxic and apoptotic activity, whereas the monomers did not display any activity at all.

The synthesis was carried out using two building blocks, which were prepared from enantiomerically pure oxiranes and methyl acetoacetate and then reacted with each other to form naphthopyranones. Monomeric and dimeric naphthopyranones were synthesized and then a structure&#8211;activity relationship study was carried out.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimeric naphthopyranones are known to be biologically active, however, for the corresponding monomeric naphthopyranones this information is still elusive. Here the first enantioselective total synthesis of semi-viriditoxic acid as well as the synthesis of semi&#8211;viriditoxin and derivatives is reported. The key intermediate in the synthesis of naphthopyranones is an &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated &#948;-lactone, which we synthesized in two different ways (&lt;i&gt;Ghosez&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;cyclization and &lt;i&gt;Grubbs&lt;/i&gt; ring&#8211;closing metathesis), while the domino&#8211;&lt;i&gt;Michael&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;i&gt;Dieckmann&lt;/i&gt; reaction of the &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated &#948;-lactone with an orsellinic acid derivative is the key reaction. A structure-activity relationship study was performed measuring the cytotoxicity in Burkitt B lymphoma cells (Ramos). The dimeric structure was found to be crucial for biological activity: Only the dimeric naphthopyranones showed cytotoxic and apoptotic activity, whereas the monomers did not display any activity at all.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stabilization of Lantern&#8208;Type Metal&#8208;Organic Cages (MOCs) by Protective Control of Ligand Exchange Rates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stability of metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) in solution depends on steric bulk and hydrophobicity proximal to the paddlewheel nodes. Increased bulk from alkyl side chains increases the effective half&#8208;life of the cages in competitive &#8220;MOC+MOC&#8221; equilibrations from thirty minutes to three hours. Solvent coligands play a similar role in protecting the metal nodes and reducing exchange rates.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembling systems in nature display remarkable complexity with assemblies of different sub&#8208;units to generate functional species. Synthetic analogues of such systems are a challenge, often requiring the ability to bias distributions that are under thermodynamic assembly control. Using lantern&#8208;type MOCs (metal&#8208;organic cages) as a prototypical self&#8208;assembling system, herein we explore the role that steric bulk plays in controlling the exchange rate of ligands in paddlewheel&#8208;based assemblies, and thus the stability of cages, in competitive self&#8208;assembling scenarios. The effective lifetime of the lantern&#8208;type MOCs varies over an order of magnitude depending on the steric bulk proximal to the metal nodes with lifetimes of the cages ranging from tens of minutes to several hours. The bulk of the coordinating solvents likewise reduces the rate of ligand exchange, and thus yields longer&#8208;lived species. Understanding this subtle effect has implications for controlling the stability of complex assemblies in competitive environments with implications for guest release and application.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Solvatochirochromism of Single Benzene Chromophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cysteine&#8208;based single benzene chromophore system that shows ultrasensitivity to solvents is reported. It illustrates that structurally simple organic compounds without aggregation or folding behaviors possess pronounced solvatochiroptical properties, which sheds light on the next&#8208;generation of chiroptical sensors and switches.







Abstract
Solvents influence the structure, aggregation and folding behaviors of solvatochromic compounds. Ultrasensitive solvent mediated chiroptical response is conducive to the fabrication of molecular platform for sensing and recognition, which however, remains great challenges in conceptual or applicable design. Here we report a cysteine&#8208;based single benzene chromophore system that shows ultrasensitivity to solvents. Compared to the ratiometrically responsive systems, the chiroptical activities could be triggered or inverted depending on the substituents of chiral entities with an ultralow solvent volume fraction (&lt;1&#8197;vol&#8201;%). One drop of dipolar solvents shall significantly induce the emergence or inversion of chiroptical signals in bulky phases. Based on the experimental and computational studies, the ultrasensitivity is contributed to the intimate interplay between solvents and chiral compounds that anchors the specific chiral conformation. It illustrates that structurally simple organic compounds without aggregation or folding behaviors possess pronounced solvatochiroptical properties, which sheds light on the next&#8208;generation of chiroptical sensors and switches.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Complex of the Parent Phosphinidene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pre&#8208;reactive complex (HP&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;HCl) in prototype phosphinidene insertion reactions has been observed in the photoreaction between the parent phosphinidene PH and HCl in an Ar&#8208;matrix at 10&#8197;K. This hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex is highly unstable, as its structure varies in the presence of other weak hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors such as N2 and HCl.







Abstract
The diatomic molecule PH is very reactive, and it serves as the parent compound for phosphinidenes featuring a monovalent phosphorus atom. Herein, we report the characterization and reactivity of a rare hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex of PH. Specifically, the molecular complex between PH and HCl has been generated by photolysis of chlorophosphine (H2PCl) at 254&#8197;nm in a solid Ar&#8208;matrix at 10&#8197;K. The IR spectrum of the complex HP&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;HCl and quantum chemical calculations at the UCCSD(T)&#8208;F12a/haTZ level consistently prove that the phosphorus atom acts as a hydrogen bond acceptor with a binding energy (D0) of &#8722;0.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. In line with the observed absorption at 341&#8197;nm for the binary complex, the triplet phosphinidene PH undergoes prototype H&#8722;Cl bond insertion by reformation of H2PCl upon photoexcitation at 365&#8197;nm. However, this hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex is unstable in the presence of N2 and HCl, as both molecules prefers stronger interactions with HCl than PH in the observed complexes HP&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;HCl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N2 and HP&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;2HCl.

         <title>Selectivity in Adduct Formation of a Bidentate Boron Lewis Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The adduct formation of a bidentate boron Lewis acid with diamines and &#8208;phosphines with an increasing linker length was observed in solution by NMR experiments and in the solid state by X&#8208;ray diffraction. This study offers insight into the selectivity of the host&#8208;guest adduct formation of bidentate Lewis acids with host molecules of varying size.







Abstract
A bidentate boron Lewis acid based on 1,8&#8208;diethynylanthracene has been studied in detail with respect to its adduct formation with diamines and diphosphanes of different linker lengths between the donor functions. A clear correlation between the linker length of the bifunctional base and the formation of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 adducts, 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 adducts or oligomers was found. The adducts were characterized in solution by NMR titration experiments and structurally by X&#8208;ray diffraction. In addition, adduct formation and competition experiments of the host system with ZR3 (Z=N, P; R=H, Me) demonstrated the generally higher stability of alkylphosphane adducts compared to alkylamine adducts with boron functions. The results provide a general insight into the adduct formation of bidentate Lewis acids with guests of different sizes as well as the differences in stability between borane&#8208;amine and borane&#8208;phosphane adducts.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Eosin Y&#8208;Based Heterogeneous Photocatalyst for Organic Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;printed Eosin Y was prepared by radical photopolymerization to obtain new heterogeneous photocatalyst with a well&#8208;defined morphology. Taking advantage of the 3D&#8208;printing technology, the heterogeneous EY was designed to fit around the magnetic stirring bar to facilitate both implementation of various organic transformations and catalyst recovery. This very robust photocatalyst is easily recycled and the efficiency was still very high even after 8 reactions.







Abstract
Heterogenization of Eosin Y by 3D&#8208;printing and its application in photocatalysis are reported. The approach allows a fine tuning of the photocatalyst morphology and its rapid preparation. Photocatalytic activity was evaluated through model organic reactions involving oxidation, reduction, and photosensitization pathways. The efficiency, recyclability and stability of 3D printed EY is remarkable paving the way to new generation of heterogeneous photocatalysts with a perfect control of their shape and adaptable to any photoreactors.

&lt;p&gt;Heterogenization of Eosin Y by 3D-printing and its application in photocatalysis are reported. The approach allows a fine tuning of the photocatalyst morphology and its rapid preparation. Photocatalytic activity was evaluated through model organic reactions involving oxidation, reduction, and photosensitization pathways. The efficiency, recyclability and stability of 3D printed EY is remarkable paving the way to new generation of heterogeneous photocatalysts with a perfect control of their shape and adaptable to any photoreactors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrafast Halogen Dance Reactions of Bromoarenes Enabled by Catalytic Potassium Hexamethyldisilazide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic KHMDS dramatically enhances halogen&#8208;dance&#8208;type reactions to provide bromoarenes without aryne formation. KHMDS exhibits higher catalytic activity than KOtBu, which is used stoichiometrically in the Lochmann&#8211;Schlosser base. A dual catalytic cycle is proposed, demonstrating the potential of new catalytic reactions based on highly reactive mixed organometallic species.







Abstract
Lochmann&#8211;Schlosser base, a stoichiometric combination of nBuLi and KOtBu, is commonly used as a superbase for deprotonating a wide range of organic compounds. In the present study, we report that catalytic potassium hexamethyldisilazide (KHMDS) exhibits higher catalytic activity than KOtBu for successive bromine&#8211;metal exchanges. Accordingly, 1&#8211;10&#8197;mol% of KHMDS dramatically enhances halogen dance reactions to introduce various electrophiles to bromopyridine, bromoimidazole, bromothiophene, bromofuran, and bromobenzene derivatives with the bromo group translocated from the original position. A dual catalytic cycle is proposed to explain the ultrafast bromine transfer.

         <title>First Potassium Fluoroaluminate Ionic Exchanger for Rapid and Selective Removal of Sr2+ with High Capacity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Remarkable potassium fluoroaluminate possesses an excellent adsorption selectivity (Kd=~6.1&#215;104&#8197;mL&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1) and a maximum adsorption capacity of (qm=~120.32&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1) for Sr2+. Importantly, it still keep a very good selectivity for Sr2+ ions even in the presence of competing Na+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ aqueous solutions.







Abstract
90Sr, as a typical artificial radionuclide, poses a serious threat to human health and the ecological environment. The selective removal of this radionuclide from industrial nuclear waste is crucial for our environment. Here we report a novel potassium fluoroaluminate, K2[(AlF5)H2O], which was synthesized by a simple low&#8208;temperature one&#8208;step method. It adopts a 1D AlF6&#8208;chain structure, which consists of exchangeable potassium ions in between the infinite chains of octahedral Al centers. As a remarkable inorganic ionic exchanger, K2[(AlF5)H2O] has a high chemical stability (resistance of pH=~3&#8208;12) and thermal stability (&#8805;~300&#8201;&#176;C). It possesses an excellent adsorption selectivity (Kd=~6.1&#215;104&#8197;mL&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1) and a maximum adsorption capacity of qm=~120.32&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 for Sr2+. Importantly, it still keep a very good selectivity for Sr2+ ions even in the presence of competing Na+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ aqueous solutions. K2[(AlF5)H2O] is the first example of fluoroaluminate ionic exchange materials that can capture Sr2+. This result opens up a new way to design and synthesize inorganic ionic exchangers for the selective removal of Sr2+ ions from radioactive waste water.

         <title>Backside versus Frontside SN2 Reactions of Alkyl Triflates and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One way or another! Our quantum chemical calculations show how and why the well&#8208;established mechanistic preference for the backside SN2 pathway slowly erodes and can even be overruled by the unusual frontside SN2 substitution mechanism going from strong to weak alcohol nucleophiles in substitution reactions with alkyl triflates.







Abstract
Nucleophilic substitution reactions are elementary reactions in organic chemistry that are used in many synthetic routes. By quantum chemical methods, we have investigated the intrinsic competition between the backside SN2 (SN2&#8208;b) and frontside SN2 (SN2&#8208;f) pathways using a set of simple alkyl triflates as the electrophile in combination with a systematic series of phenols and partially fluorinated ethanol nucleophiles. It is revealed how and why the well&#8208;established mechanistic preference for the SN2&#8208;b pathway slowly erodes and can even be overruled by the unusual SN2&#8208;f substitution mechanism going from strong to weak alcohol nucleophiles. Activation strain analyses disclose that the SN2&#8208;b pathway is favored for strong alcohol nucleophiles because of the well&#8208;known intrinsically more efficient approach to the electrophile resulting in a more stabilizing nucleophile&#8211;electrophile interaction. In contrast, the preference of weaker alcohol nucleophiles shifts to the SN2&#8208;f pathway, benefiting from a stabilizing hydrogen bond interaction between the incoming alcohol and the leaving group. This hydrogen bond interaction is strengthened by the increased acidity of the weaker alcohol nucleophiles, thereby steering the mechanistic preference toward the frontside SN2 pathway.

         <title>Prism[2]dihydrophenazines: Synthesis, Configurational Analysis, and Supramolecular Tessellation through Exo&#8208;Wall Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of macrocyclic arenes (prism[2]dihydrophenazines) with tunable flexibility have been fabricated by AlCl3&#8208;catalyzed Friedel&#8208;Crafts reactions between methyl&#8208;substituted derivatives of dihydrophenazine subunits and paraformaldehyde in 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane. Cocrystallization of the flexible prism[2]dihydrophenazine with the electron&#8208;deficient guest tetrafluoro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone resulted in regular parallelogram&#8208;like supramolecular tessellation.







Abstract
Macrocyclic arenes have gained considerable attention for their structural diversity and widespread applications. In this research, a new kind of macrocyclic arenes, namely prism[2]dihydrophenazines (anti&#8208;P2P20, syn&#8208;P2P20, and P2P22), composed of two dihydrophenazine derivatives subunits bridged by methylene groups, were conveniently synthesized by AlCl3&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot condensation in 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane. Both anti&#8208;P2P20 and its isomer syn&#8208;P2P20 exhibited flexible and convertible conformation with narrow cavity, while P2P22 possessed rigid and rhombic&#8208;like skeleton due to the more steric hindrance on subunits. In addition, the selection of electron&#8208;deficient guest was found to influence the outside binding behavior of syn&#8208;P2P20. Fantastic regular supramolecular tessellation was fabricated by tiling of syn&#8208;P2P20 with tetrafluoro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TFB) through the exo&#8208;wall interactions. Using 1,5&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzene (DFN) as a linker, only the regular 2D network superstructure with periodic units in a plane was obtained through cocrystallization. This work not only reports the construction of supramolecular tessellations by using prism[2]dihydrophenazines as building blocks, but also provides a new perspective for the design of macrocyclic arenes and fabrication of 2D supramolecular materials.

         <title>A Tandem Hydroformylation&#8208;Organocatalyzed Friedel&#8208;Crafts Reaction for the Synthesis of Diindolylmethanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a highly efficient and atom&#8208;economic tandem hydroformylation &#8211; organocatalyzed Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction sequence for the synthesis of diindolylmethanes is presented. The synthesis of 21&#8197;derivatives with overall yields of up to 85&#8201;% showed that we were able to expand the range of readily accessible diidolylmethanes while demonstrating the utility of our presented method.







Abstract
Herein, we present an efficient and atom&#8208;economic tandem hydroformylation organocatalyzed Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction sequence for the synthesis of diindolylmethanes. Classic syntheses have relied on (Lewis) acid activation of aldehydes, which are often not commercially available and rather sensitive in handling. In contrast, the combination of rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation and subsequent organocatalytic activation of the in&#8208;situ formed aldehydes allows the use of readily available and stable alkenes with various functional groups while avoiding acidic conditions to expand the range of available diindolylmethanes. A broad scope of diindolylmethanes was prepared in yields up to 85&#8201;% demonstrates the utility of the presented method.

         <title>Reversibly Tuning the Viscosity of Peptide&#8208;Based Solutions Using Visible Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8211;switchable merocyanine photoacid has been used to induce reversible pH drops during the assembly of the modified dipeptide molecule 1ThNapFF. As the pH is decreased, protonation of 1ThNapFF leads to increased aggregation and increased viscosity. These reversible viscosity changes can be used to design systems where flow can be controlled in a non&#8211;invasive and localised way.







Abstract
Light can be used to design stimuli&#8211;responsive systems. We induce transient changes in the assembly of a low molecular weight gelator solution using a merocyanine photoacid. Through our approach, reversible viscosity changes can be achieved via irradiation, delivering systems where flow can be controlled non&#8208;invasively on demand.

         <title>Effect of Benzo&#8208;Annelation on Triplet State Energies in Polycyclic Conjugated Hydrocarbons&#8224;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In a series of earlier studies, the effect of benzo&#8208;annelation was found to be a useful tool for tuning the aromaticity in polycyclic conjugated compounds to desired level. In this work we studied the (anti)aromaticity of benzo&#8208;annelated derivatives of three conjugated hydrocarbons (anthracene, fluoranthene and biphenylene) in their lowest lying singlet (S0) and triplet (T1) states by means of the energy effect (ef), harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity (HOMA), multicentre delocalization indices (MCI), magnetically induced current densities (MICDs) and nucleus independent chemical shifts (NICS). We showed that benzo&#8208;annelation is a topology&#8208;based effect which can be used to modify the T1 state excitation energies (E(T1)). A quantitative model was established being able to accurately predict the E(T1) based only on the numbers of angularly, linearly and geminally annelated benzene rings. In addition, it was demonstrated that the E(T1) can be directly related to the (anti)aromatic character of the central ring in the studied molecules in their S0 state.</dc:description>

         <title>20&#960;&#8208;Electron Antiaromatic Benziphthalocyanines with Absorption Reaching the Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Region</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1500 nm) light has attracted considerable attention, especially for life sciences applications, the development of organic dyes with NIR&#8208;II absorption remains a formidable challenge. Herein we report the design, synthesis, and electronic properties of 20&#960;&#8208;electron antiaromatic benziphthalocyanines (BPcs) that exhibit intense absorption bands in the NIR region. The strong, low&#8208;energy absorption of the antiaromatic BPcs is attributed to electric&#8208;dipole&#8208;allowed HOMO&#8208;LUMO transitions with narrow band gaps, enabled by the reduced structural symmetry of BPc compared with regular porphyrins and phthalocyanines. The combination of peripheral substituents and a central metal decreases the HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gaps, leading to the extension of the absorption bands into the NIR&#8208;II region (reaching 1100 nm) under reductive conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Roles of Oxygen&#8208;Containing Functional Groups in Carbon for Electrocatalytic Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent years have witnessed great research interests in developing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for the two&#8208;electron (2e&#8211;) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) that enables the sustainable and flexible synthesis of H2O2. Carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts exhibit attractive catalytic performance for the 2e&#8211; ORR, where oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups (OFGs) play a decisive role. However, current understanding is far from adequate, and the contribution of OFGs to the catalytic performance remains controversial. Therefore, a critical overview on OFGs in carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts toward the 2e&#8211; ORR is highly desirable. Herein, we go over the methods for constructing OFGs in carbon including chemical oxidation, electrochemical oxidation, and precursor inheritance. Then we review the roles of OFGs in activating carbon toward the 2e&#8211; ORR, focusing on the intrinsic activity of different OFGs and the interplay between OFGs and metal species or defects. At last, we discuss the reasons for inconsistencies among different studies, and personal perspectives on the future development in this field are provided. The results provide insights into the origin of high catalytic activity and selectivity of carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts toward the 2e&#8211; ORR and would provide theoretical foundations for the future development in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Recognition of Amino Acid Salts by Temperature&#8208;Dependent Allosteric Binding with Stereodynamic Urea Receptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Positive homotropic artificial allosteric systems are important for the regulation of cooperativity, selectivity and nonlinear amplification. Stereodynamic homotropic allosteric receptors can transmit and amplify induced chirality by the first ligand binding to axial chirality between two chromophores. We herein report stereodynamic allosteric urea receptors consisting of a rotational shaft as the axial chirality unit, terphenyl units as structural transmission sites and four urea units as binding sites. NMR titration experiments revealed that the receptor can bind two carboxylate guests in a positive homotropic allosteric manner attributed to the inactivation by intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding between urea units within the receptor. In addition, the VT&#8208;CD spectra observed upon binding of the urea receptor with L&#8208; or D&#8208;amino acid salts in MeCN showed interesting temperature&#8208;dependent Cotton effects, based on the differences of the receptor shaft unit and the guest structure. The successful discrimination of hydrocarbon&#8208;based side chains of amino acid salts indicated that the input of chiral and steric information for the guest was amplified as outputs of the Cotton effect and the temperature&#8208;dependence of VT&#8208;CD spectra through cooperativity of positive allosteric binding.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;free selective synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes from alkenes and formaldehyde catalyzed by dimethylamine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated aldehydes are important building blocks for the synthesis of a wide range of chemicals, including polymers. The synthesis of these molecules from cheap feedstocks such as alkenes remains a scientific challenge, mainly due to the low reactivity of alkenes. Here we report a selective and metal&#8208;free access to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes from alkenes with formaldehyde. This reaction is catalyzed by dimethylamine and affords &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes in yields of up to 80%. By combining Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and experiments, we elucidate the reaction mechanism which is based on a cascade of hydride transfer, hydrolysis and aldolization reactions. The reaction can be performed under very mild conditions (30&#8208;50&#160;&#176;C), in a theoretically 100% carbon&#8208;economical fashion, with water as the only by&#8208;product. The reaction was successfully applied to non&#8208;activated linear 1&#8208;alkenes, thus opening an access to industrially relevant &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes from cheap and widely abundant chemicals at large scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Functionalization of Azetidine&#8208;Containing Small Macrocyclic Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic peptides are increasingly important structures in drugs but their development can be impeded by difficulties associated with their synthesis. Here, we introduce the 3&#8208;aminoazetidine (3&#8208;AAz) subunit as a new turn&#8208;inducing element for the efficient synthesis of small head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclic peptides. Greatly improved cyclizations of tetra&#8208;, penta&#8208; and hexapeptides (28 examples) under standard reaction conditions are achieved by introduction of this element within the linear peptide precursor. Post&#8208;cyclization deprotection of the amino acid side chains with strong acid is realized without degradation of the strained four&#8208;membered azetidine. An special feature of this chemistry is that further late&#8208;stage modification of the resultant macrocyclic peptides can be achieved via the 3&#8208;AAz unit.&#160;&#160;This is done by: (i) chemoselective deprotection and substitution at the azetidine nitrogen, or by (ii) a click&#8208;based approach employing a 2&#8208;propynyl carbamate on the azetidine nitrogen. In this way, a range of dye and biotin tagged macrocycles are readily produced. Structural insights gained by XRD analysis of a cyclic tetrapeptide indicate that the azetidine ring encourages access to the less stable, all&#8208;trans conformation. Moreover, introduction of a 3&#8208;AAz into a representative cyclohexapeptide improves stability towards proteases compared to the homodetic macrocycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Dehydro[12]&#8208; and [18]annulene&#8208;Fused Ball&#8208;Shaped Ruthenium Complex Oligomers: Synthesis, Aromatic/Antiaromatic Effect, and Symmetry for Near&#8208;Infrared Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The appropriate arrangement of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) chromophores allows for the modification of the peak wavelength in the NIR region and efficient use of NIR light. However, the preparation of novel NIR chromophores using simple procedures remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the synthesis of ball&#8208;shaped ruthenium complex oligomers. The metal complexes can be synthesized in a single step and interact strongly with NIR light. Alkyne&#8208;substituted low&#8208;symmetry ball&#8208;shaped ruthenium complexes were synthesized and subjected to Eglinton coupling to obtain dehydro[12] and [18]annulene&#8208;fused dimers and trimers. Fine&#8208;tuning of the reaction conditions led to the selective synthesis of the target oligomers. NMR spectroscopy confirmed that the 18&#960;&#8208;aromatic and 12&#960;&#8208;antiaromatic properties of the annulene influenced the ruthenium complex chromophore, and magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy showed changes in the electronic structure of their excited state owing to molecular&#8208;symmetry differences. The absorption coefficient in the NIR region of the absorption spectra of the oligomers increased significantly, supporting the efficient use of light by oligomerization. The formation of oligomers using ball&#8208;shaped metal complexes is a simple and effective strategy for controlling NIR optical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Detection of Nucleic Acids in Extracellular Vesicles via Membrane Fusion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry diverse biomolecules (e.g., nucleic acids, proteins) for intercellular communication, which can serve as important markers for diseases. Analyzing nucleic acids sourced from EVs enables non&#8208;invasive disease diagnosis and prognosis evaluation. Membrane fusion, a fundamental cellular process merging two lipid membranes, facilitates cell communication and cargo transport. Drawing inspiration from this natural phenomenon, recent years have witnessed the emergence of membrane fusion&#8208;based strategies for the detection of nucleic acids within EVs. These strategies entail the encapsulation of detection probes within either artificial or natural vesicles, which subsequently undergo membrane fusion with EVs. This innovative approach enables the in situ detection of nucleic acids within EVs while maintaining the structural integrity of EVs, thus preventing nucleic acid degradation and minimizing interference from free nucleic acids. This review categorizes approaches into universal and target membrane fusion approaches, and discusses the challenges and future prospects associated with EV nucleic acids detection using membrane fusion.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;assembly Strategy for Constructing Porous Boron and Nitrogen Co&#8208;doped Carbon as an Efficient ORR Electrocatalyst toward Zinc&#8208;air Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon nanomaterials doped with N and B could activate nearby carbon atoms to promote charge polarization through the synergistic coupling effect between N and B atoms, thus facilitating adsorption of O2 and weakening O&#8208;O bond to enhance oxygen reduction reaction. Herein, a simple and controllable self&#8208;assembly strategy is applied to synthesize porous B, N co&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;based catalysts (BCN&#8208;P), which employs the macrocyclic molecule cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) as the carbon and nitrogen source, and 3D aromatic&#8208;like closo&#8208;[B12H12]2&#8208; as the boron source. In addition, polystyrene microspheres are added to help introduce porous structure to expose more active sites. Benefitting from the porous structures and the synergistic coupling effect between N and B atoms, BCN&#8208;P has a high onset potential (Eonset=0.846 V) and half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2=0.74 V) in alkaline media. The zinc&#8208;air battery assembled with BCN&#8208;P shows high operating voltage (1.42 V), peak power density (128.7 mW cm&#8208;2) and stable charge/discharge cycles, which is even comparable with Pt/C.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;IR Capturing N&#8208;Methylbenzene Sulfonamide&#8208;Phenothiazine Incorporating Strong Electron Acceptor Push&#8208;Pull Systems: Photochemical Ultrafast Carrier Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of symmetrical and asymmetrical ynamide&#8208;based donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores exhibiting strong intramolecular charge transfer have been designed, synthesized, and insight into their ultrafast carrier dynamics is investigated. Broadly tunable absorption extending even in the near&#8208;infrared region coupled with novel excited state dynamical processes brightens their prospect of utilization in advanced photonic applications.

Unraveling the intriguing aspects of the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) phenomenon of multi&#8208;modular donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;based push&#8211;pull systems are of paramount importance considering their promising applications, particularly in solar energy harvesting and light&#8208;emitting devices. Herein, a series of symmetrical and unsymmetrical donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores 1&#8211;6, are designed and synthesized by the Corey&#8208;Fuchs reaction via Evano's condition followed by [2+2] cycloaddition retroelectrocyclic ring&#8208;opening reaction with strong electron acceptors TCNE and TCNQ in good yields (~60&#8211;85&#8201;%). The photophysical, electrochemical, and computational studies are investigated to explore the effect of incorporation of strong electron acceptors 1,1,4,4&#8208;tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene (TCBD) and dicyanoquinodimethane (DCNQ) with phenothiazine (PTZ) donor. An additional low&#8208;lying broad absorption band extended towards the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region suggests charge polarization after the introduction of the electron acceptors in both symmetrical and asymmetrical systems, leading to such strong ICT bands. The electrochemical properties reveal that reduction potentials of 3 and 6 are lower than those of 2 and 5, suggesting DCNQ imparts more on the electronic properties and hence largely contributes to the stabilization of LUMO energy levels than TCBD, in line with theoretical observations. Relative positions of the frontier orbitals on geometry&#8208;optimized structures further support accessing donor&#8208;acceptor sites responsible for the ICT transitions. Eventually, ultrafast carrier dynamics of the photoinduced species are investigated by femtosecond transient absorption studies to identify their spectral characteristics and target analysis further provides information about different excited states photophysical events including ICT and their associated time profiles. The key findings obtained here related to excited state dynamical processes of these newly synthesized systems are believed to be significant in advancing their prospect of utilization in solar energy conversion and related photonic applications.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structure of the spirocyclic product obtained by reacting catechol with 1,1&#8208;dichloro&#8208;2&#8208;(chloromethyl)cyclopropane is shown by NMR and X&#8208;ray analysis to be that of a 2&#8208;methylcyclopropene (MeCP), instead of the previously reported 2&#8208;methylenecyclopropane (MCP) one. The study of the equilibration between the two isomeric forms by experimental and computational means (including both Density Functional Theory &#8211; DFT &#8211; and Coupled Cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations &#8211; CCSD(T) &#8211; calculations) revealed that, at variance with most of the alkylidenecyclopropane/alkylcyclopropene systems described to date, for the compounds of the present study the MeCP derivative is more stable by&#160;approx. 2.5&#8208;3.0 Kcal mol&#8208;1 than the MCP one. The extension of the DFT and CCSD(T) study to other spiro&#8208;MCP/MeCP pairs suggests that the origin of the unexpected shift of the equilibrium position can be tracked back to a combination of electronic and ring&#8208;strain effects. These findings lead to re&#8208;think a long&#8208;standing, and substantially undisputed belief in the area of unsaturated cyclopropane derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating &#946;&#8208;Keto&#8208;enamine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Atom&#8208;Transfer Radical Addition Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atom&#8208;transfer radical addition reactions have been achieved by using covalent organic frameworks as visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysts without the need for transition metals, sacrificial agents, or base. Simple modification of the monomers enables the photocatalytic activity to be tuned.







Abstract
The atom&#8208;transfer radical addition (ATRA) reaction simultaneously forges carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;halogen bonds. However, frequently&#8208;used photosensitizers such as precious transition metal complexes, or organic dyes have limitations in terms of their potential toxicity and recyclability. Three &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) from 1,3,5&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol and 1,4&#8208;phenylenediamines with variable transient photocurrent and photocatalytic activity have been prepared. A COF bearing electron&#8208;deficient Cl atoms displayed the highest photocatalytic activity toward the ATRA reaction of polyhalogenated alkanes to give halogenated olefins under visible light at room temperature. This heterogeneous photocatalyst exhibited good functional group tolerance and could be recycled without significant loss of activity.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Charge Separation in Covalently Linked BODIPY&#8208;Quinone&#8208;Alkyne Dyads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of bodipy&#8208;quinone dyads and their photoinduced charge separation is reported using a complementary set of experimental and theoretical methods. Dyads feature an additional alkyne group as potential anchor group for further functionalizations, featuring electron storing or catalytic behaviors.







Abstract
Visible light&#8208;induced charge separation and directional charge transfer are cornerstones for artificial photosynthesis and the generation of solar fuels. Here, we report synthetic access to a series of noble metal&#8208;free donor&#8208;acceptor dyads based on bodipy light&#8208;absorbers and redox&#8208;active quinone/anthraquinone charge storage sites. Peripheral functionalization of the quinone/anthraquinone units with alkynes primes the dyads for integration into a range of light&#8208;harvesting systems, e.&#8201;g., by Cu&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions (CLICK chemistry) or Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Initial photophysical, electrochemical and theoretical analyses reveal the principal processes during the light&#8208;induced charge separation in the reported dyads.

         <title>Nanoreactor Confined and Enriched Intermediates for Electroreduction of CO2 to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper sulfide nanoreactor (donated as CuS&#8722;NR) catalyst was fabricated for eCO2RR to C2+ products and the corresponding FE reaches 53&#8201;%, which is the highest value reported for copper sulfide&#8208;based catalysts. The excellent C&#8722;C coupling performance comes from the confinement and enrichment of intermediate in the nanoreactor.







Abstract
In the process of electroreduction of carbon dioxide (eCO2RR) to multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products, it is imperative to enhance the concentration of key intermediate species on the catalyst surface. The utilization of micro&#8208;nano reactors to achieve confinement effects has been widely observed in various catalytic reactions, yet it has seldom been employed in eCO2RR. Here, we present a novel nanoreactor composed of stacked CuS nanosheets for eCO2RR to C2+ products. In comparison to catalyst comprising of nanosheet with open space, the C&#8722;C coupling within this confined nanospace is significantly enhanced, resulting in the increase of Faraday efficiency (FE) of C2+ products to 53&#8201;%. In situ infrared (IR) spectroscopy reveals the confinement and enrichment of key intermediate by the nanoreactor. Our research findings demonstrate that a meticulously designed nanoreactor can elevate the selectivity of C2+ products, thereby aiding in the design of eCO2RR catalysts.

Fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) has attracted extensive attention due to its potential of real&#8208;time monitoring the lesion locations and visualizing the treatment process with high sensitivity and resolution. Aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) show enhanced fluorescence and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation after cellular uptake, giving them significant advantages in bioimaging and PDT applications. However, most AIEgens are unfavorable for the application in organisms due to their severe hydrophobicity. Anion&#8208;&#960;+ type AIEgens carry intrinsic charges that can effectively alleviate their hydrophobicity and improve their binding capability to cells, which is expected to enhance the bioimaging quality and PDT performance. This concept summarizes the applications of anion&#8208;&#960;+ type AIEgens in fluorescence imaging, fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic anticancer and antimicrobial therapy in recent years, hoping to provide some new ideas for the construction of robust photosensitizers. Finally, the current problems and future challenges of anion&#8208;&#960;+ AIEgens are discussed.

         <title>Gas Evolution as a Tool to Study Reaction Kinetics Under Biomimetic Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress of transition metal&#8208;catalysed bioorthogonal chemical reactions can be accurately monitored by measuring the gas evolution in time using a bubble counter. This protocol provides insight into the performance of a catalytic system under biomimetic conditions, supporting iterative catalyst development for in&#8197;vivo applications.







Abstract
The field of bioorthogonal chemistry is rapidly growing, presenting successful applications of organic and transition metal&#8208;catalysed reactions in cells and living systems (in vivo). The development of such reactions typically proceeds through many iterative steps focused on biocompatibility and fast reaction kinetics to ensure product formation. However, obtaining kinetic data, even under simulated biological (biomimetic) conditions, remains a challenge due to substantial concentrations of salts and biomolecules hampering the use of typically employed solution&#8208;phase analytical techniques. In this study, we explored the suitability of gas evolution as a probe to study kinetics under biomimetic conditions. As proof of concept, we show that the progress of two transition metal&#8208;catalysed bioorthogonal chemical reactions can be accurately monitored, regardless of the complexity of the medium. As such, we introduce a protocol to gain more insight into the performance of a catalytic system under biomimetic conditions to further progress iterative catalyst development for in vivo applications.

         <title>C3&#8208;Symmetric Luminescent Diketone with Amido&#8208;Linkage as a Polymorphic Fluorescence Emitter</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

The study presents BTA&#8208;D3, a novel C3&#8208;symmetric &#946;&#8208;diketone compound, and its monomeric counterpart, D, focusing on synthesis, photophysical properties, theoretical calculation, and aggregation properties. BTA&#8208;D3 exhibits Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) with solvent&#8208;dependent fluorescence. The anisotropy fluorescence suggested the presence of energy migration in BTA&#8208;D3. Unique polymorphism and growth of self&#8208;organized aggregates offer insights into molecular alignment for diverse fluorescence in materials.







Abstract
The study introduces a novel C3&#8208;symmetric &#946;&#8208;diketone compound, BTA&#8208;D3, and its monomeric counterpart, D, with a focus on their synthetic procedure, photophysical properties and aggregation behavior. Both compounds exhibit characteristic absorption and weak fluorescence in solution, with BTA&#8208;D3 displaying higher absorption coefficients due to its larger number of diketone units. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations suggest increased co&#8208;planarity of diketone groups in BTA&#8208;D3. A significant finding is the Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) property of BTA&#8208;D3, as its fluorescence intensity increases dramatically when exposed to specific solvent ratios. The AIE behavior is attributed to intermolecular excitonic interaction between BTA&#8208;D3 molecules in self&#8208;organized aggregates. We also studied fluorescence anisotropy of BTA&#8208;D3 and D. Despite its larger size, BTA&#8208;D3 showed reduced anisotropy values because of efficient intramolecular energy migration among three diketone units. Furthermore, BTA&#8208;D3 demonstrates unique polymorphism, yielding different emission colors and structures depending on the solvent used. A unique approach is presented for promoting the growth of self&#8208;organized aggregate structures via solvent evaporation, leading to distinct fluorescence properties. This research contributes to the understanding of C3&#8208;symmetric structural molecules and provides insights into strategies for controlling molecular alignment to achieve diverse fluorescence coloration in molecular materials.

         <title>Anilato&#8208;based Coordination Polymers with Slow Relaxation of the Magnetization: Role of the Synthetic Method and Anilato ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have prepared and characterized three coordination polymers formulated as [Dy2(C6O4Cl2)3(fma)6]&#183;4.5fma (1) and [Dy2(C6O4X2)3(fma)6]&#183;4fma&#183;2H2O with X = Br (2) and Cl (3), where fma&#160;= formamide and C6O4X22&#8208; = 3,6&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;2,5&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone dianion with X = Cl (chloranilato) and Br (bromanilato). Compounds 1 and 3 are solvates obtained with slow and fast precipitation methods, respectively. Compounds 2 and 3 are isostructural and only differ in the X group of the anilato ligand. The three compounds present (6,3)&#8209;gon two&#8208;dimensional hexagonal honey&#8208;comb structures. Magnetic measurements indicate that the three compounds show slow relaxation of the magnetization at low temperatures when a continuous magnetic field is applied, although with different relaxation times and energy barriers depending on X and the crystallisation molecules. Compounds 1&#8208;3 represent the first examples of anilato&#8208;based lattices with formamide and field&#8208;induced slow relaxation of the magnetization.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A series of isostructural imidonitridophosphates AE2AlP8N15(NH) (AE = Ca, Sr, Ba) was synthesized at high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature conditions (1400 &#176;C and 5&#8211;9 GPa) from alkaline&#8208;earth metal nitrides or azides Ca3N2/Sr(N3)2/Ba(N3)2 and the binary nitrides AlN and P3N5. NH4F served as a hydrogen source and mineralizing agent. The crystal structures were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and feature a three&#8208;dimensional network of vertex&#8208;sharing PN4&#8208;tetrahedra forming diverse&#8208;sized rings that are occupied by aluminum and alkaline earth ions. These structures represent another example of nitridophosphate&#8208;based networks that simultaneously incorporate AlN6&#8208;octahedra and alkaline&#8208;earth&#8208;centered polyhedra, with aluminum not participating in the tetrahedra network. They differ from previously reported ones by incorporating non&#8208;condensed octahedra instead of strongly condensed octahedra units and contribute to the diversity of multicationic nitridophosphate network structures. The results are supported by atomic resolution EDX mapping, solid&#8208;state NMR and FTIR measurements. Eu2+&#8208;doped samples show strong luminescence with narrow emissions in the range of green to blue under UV excitation, marking another instance of Eu2+&#8208;luminescence within imidonitridophosphates.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Recently, the discovery of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as excellent candidates for overcoming antibiotic resistance has attracted significant attention. AMPs are short peptides active against bacteria, cancer cells, and viruses. It has been shown that the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleocapsid protein (N&#8208;P) undergoes liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation in the presence of RNA, resulting in biocondensate formation. These biocondensates are crucial for viral replication as they concentrate the viral RNA with the host cell`s protein machinery required for viral protein expression. Thus, N&#8208;P biocondensates are promising targets to block or slow down viral RNA transcription and consequently virion assembly. We investigated the ability of three AMPs to interfere with N&#8208;P/RNA condensates. Using microscopy techniques, supported by biophysical characterization, we found that the AMP LL&#8208;III partitions into the condensate, leading to clustering. Instead, the AMP CrACP1 partitions into the droplets without affecting their morphology but reducing their dynamics. Conversely, GKY20 leads to the formation of fibrillar structures after partitioning. It can be expected that such morphological transformation severely impairs the normal functionality of the N&#8208;P droplets and thus virion assembly. These results could pave the way for the development of a new class of AMP&#8208;based antiviral agents targeting biocondensates.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recently, the discovery of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as excellent candidates for overcoming antibiotic resistance has attracted significant attention. AMPs are short peptides active against bacteria, cancer cells, and viruses. It has been shown that the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N-P) undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation in the presence of RNA, resulting in biocondensate formation. These biocondensates are crucial for viral replication as they concentrate the viral RNA with the host cell`s protein machinery required for viral protein expression. Thus, N-P biocondensates are promising targets to block or slow down viral RNA transcription and consequently virion assembly. We investigated the ability of three AMPs to interfere with N-P/RNA condensates. Using microscopy techniques, supported by biophysical characterization, we found that the AMP LL-III partitions into the condensate, leading to clustering.

         <title>Phosphinidenes: Fundamental Properties and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 15, March 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphinidenes are very reactive compounds containing a monocoordinated phosphorus atom, and this class of low&#8208;valent phosphorus compounds serves as versatile intermediates in synthetic phosphorus chemistry. In this Concept we will review the recent experimental progresses in probing the fundamental properties of the prototype phosphinidenes in the triplet and singlet state.







Abstract
Phosphinidenes are heavy congeners of nitrenes that have been broadly used as in&#8197;situ reagents in synthetic phosphorus chemistry and also serve as versatile ligands in coordination with transition metals. However, the detection of free phosphinidenes is largely challenged by their high reactivity and also the lack of suitable synthetic methods, rendering the knowledge about the fundamental properties of this class of low&#8208;valent phosphorus compounds limited. Recently, an increasing number of free phosphinidenes bearing prototype structural and bonding properties have been prepared for the first time, thus enabling the exploration of their distinct reactivity from the nitrene analogues. This Concept article will discuss the experimental approaches for the generation of the highly unstable phosphinidenes and highlight their distinct reactivity from the nitrogen analogues so as to stimuate future studies about their potential applications in phosphorus chemistry.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship Study to Develop Peptide Amphiphiles as Species&#8208;Specific Antimicrobials</title>

Antimicrobial peptide amphiphiles nanostructures were studied regarding the supramolecular structure&#8208;activity and the key structure contributors for activity. For Staphylococcus aureus the zeta potential was more important while Gram&#8208;negative bacteria were more influenced by LogP. Mechanism of action and an in&#8197;vivo study was also performed. We showed these nanostructures can be an intriguing platform for the development of novel nanoantibacterials.







Abstract
Antimicrobial peptide amphiphiles (PAs) are a promising class of molecules that can disrupt the bacterial membrane or act as drug nanocarriers. In this study, we prepared 33&#8197;PAs to establish supramolecular structure&#8208;activity relationships. We studied the morphology and activity of the nanostructures against different Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacterial strains (such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii). Next, we used principal component analysis (PCA) to determine the key contributors to activity. We found that for S. aureus, the zeta potential was the major contributor to the activity while Gram&#8208;negative bacteria were more influenced by the partition coefficient (LogP) with the following order P. aeruginosa&gt;E. coli&gt;A. baumannii. We also performed a study of the mechanism of action of selected PAs on the bacterial membrane assessing the membrane permeability and depolarization, changes in zeta potential and overall integrity. We studied the toxicity of the nanostructures against mammalian cells. Finally, we performed an in&#8197;vivo study using the wax moth larvae to determine the therapeutic efficacy of the active PAs. This study shows cationic PA nanostructures can be an intriguing platform for the development of nanoantibacterials.

         <title>Conformational Preferences at the Glycosidic Linkage of Saccharides in Solution as Deduced from NMR Experiments and MD Simulations: Comparison to Crystal Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 15, March 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The importance of solvation on the preferred conformation of saccharides in solution and in crystals is unraveled by solution&#8208;state NMR and computational MD studies of solvated disaccharides. Crystal structures containing solvated glycan structures have glycosidic linkage conformations similar to those of the carbohydrate molecules in solution.







Abstract
Glycans are central to information content and regulation in biological systems. These carbohydrate molecules are active either as oligo&#8208; or polysaccharides, often in the form of glycoconjugates. The monosaccharide entities are joined by glycosidic linkages and stereochemical arrangements are of utmost importance in determining conformation and flexibility of saccharides. The conformational preferences and population distributions at the glycosidic torsion angles &#966; and &#968; have been investigated for O&#8208;methyl glycosides of three disaccharides where the substitution takes place at a secondary alcohol, viz., in &#945;&#8208;l&#8208;Fucp&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;Glcp&#8208;OMe, &#945;&#8208;l&#8208;Fucp&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;Galp&#8208;OMe and &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;Glcp&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;Galp&#8208;OMe, corresponding to disaccharide structural elements present in bacterial polysaccharides. Stereochemical differences at or adjacent to the glycosidic linkage were explored by solution state NMR spectroscopy using one&#8208;dimensional 1H,1H&#8208;NOESY NMR experiments to obtain transglycosidic proton&#8208;proton distances and one&#8208; and two&#8208;dimensional heteronuclear NMR experiments to obtain 3JCH transglycosidic coupling constants related to torsion angles &#966; and &#968;. Computed effective proton&#8208;proton distances from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed excellent agreement to experimentally derived distances for the &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;linked disaccharides and revealed that for the bimodal distribution at the &#968; torsion angle for the &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked disaccharide experiment and simulation were at variance with each other, calling for further force field developments. The MD simulations disclosed a highly intricate inter&#8208;residue hydrogen bonding pattern for the &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked disaccharide, including a nonconventional hydrogen bond between H5&#8242; in the glucosyl residue and O3 in the galactosyl residue, supported by a large downfield 1H NMR chemical shift displacement compared to &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;Glcp&#8208;OMe. Comparison of population distributions of the glycosidic torsion angles &#966; and &#968; in the disaccharide entities to those of corresponding crystal structures highlighted the potential importance of solvation on the preferred conformation.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Ervaoffine J and K</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 15, March 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unified total syntheses of ervaoffine J and ervaoffine K were achieved from a common intermediate. The synthesis of ervaoffine J featured an aerobic, Winterfeldt oxidation and proceeded in 8&#8197;steps and 14&#8201;% overall yield. A von Braun&#8208;like C&#8722;N bond cleavage enabled access to ervaoffine K in 10&#8197;steps and 10&#8201;% yield.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the total synthesis of ervaoffine J &amp; K from a central intermediate. Ervaoffine J was synthesized in eight steps in 14&#8201;% yield. Our strategy features an aerobic Winterfeldt oxidation to introduce the 4&#8208;quinolone moiety. Ervaoffine K was produced in ten steps and 10&#8201;% yield. The synthesis leveraged (bromodifluoromethyl)&#8208;trimethylsilane to induce a regioselective von Braun&#8208;type C&#8722;N bond fragmentation.

     alt="Total Synthesis of Ervaoffine J and K"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unified total syntheses of ervaoffine J and ervaoffine K were achieved from a common intermediate. The synthesis of ervaoffine J featured an aerobic, Winterfeldt oxidation and proceeded in 8&#8197;steps and 14&#8201;% overall yield. A von Braun-like C&#8722;N bond cleavage enabled access to ervaoffine K in 10&#8197;steps and 10&#8201;% yield.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we describe the total synthesis of ervaoffine J &amp;amp; K from a central intermediate. Ervaoffine J was synthesized in eight steps in 14&#8201;% yield. Our strategy features an aerobic Winterfeldt oxidation to introduce the 4-quinolone moiety. Ervaoffine K was produced in ten steps and 10&#8201;% yield. The synthesis leveraged (bromodifluoromethyl)-trimethylsilane to induce a regioselective von Braun-type C&#8722;N bond fragmentation. This C&#8722;N bond cleavage unveiled the tetrasubstituted all-&lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt; cyclohexane core of ervaoffine K and enabled the completion of its synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Catalytic Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction of Ketones for the Synthesis of &#946;, &#947;&#8208;Disubstituted &#946;, &#947;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketones</title>

A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of methyl ketones with cyclic ketones to &#946;&#8208;branched &#946;, &#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones are reported. This catalytic route gives a unique opportunity to integrate the chemistry of synthetic challenge cross&#8208;coupling reaction of ketones and alkene migration reaction into a reaction pot. Mechanistic and DFT studies complement the synthetic work.







Abstract
C&#8722;C bond forming reaction of ketone with aldehyde is well&#8208;studied for the synthesis of &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones, however, the reaction with two different ketones to unsaturated carbonyl compound has not yet been systematically studied. Probably due to the relatively low reactivity of ketones as electrophiles (aldol acceptors), its propensity for retro&#8208;aldol reaction. The reactions often suffer from unsatisfactory chemoselectivity (self&#8208; vs. crossed aldol products) and regioselectivity (thermodynamic vs. kinetic enolate). In this quest, we report here for the first time selective cross&#8208;coupling reaction of ketones to &#946;&#8208;branched &#946;, &#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones by using ruthenium catalysis. Interestingly, single crossed aldol condensation products are formed even in reactions where a mixture of products is possible. Reaction is highly chemoselective, regioselective and produces H2O as the only byproducts making the protocol environmentally benign. Method is compatible with a wide variety of sensitive functional group and applicable for even problematic aliphatic ketones as substrates. Notably, acetone was found as a three&#8208;carbon feedstock for the syntheses of simple &#946;, &#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketone compounds. The process can further be extended to the gram&#8208;scale reaction and late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products. With the help of DFT calculations, several control experiments, and deuterium&#8208;labeling experiments, the mechanistic finding demonstrated that initial aldol&#8208;condensation of ketones to a &#946;, &#946;&#8208;disubstituted &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone, which further isomerizes to a &#946;, &#947;&#8208; unsaturated ketone via &#951;3&#8208;allyl ruthenium complex.

         <title>Modification of a Common &#946;&#8208;diketiminate NacNac Framework via Sequential Lithiation and Small Molecule Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 15, March 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Though non&#8208;innocence of the popular NacNac (BDI) ligand derived from 2,6 diisopropylphenyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methyldiketimine has been observed in a few studies, rarely has this non&#8208;innocence been deliberately exploited to generate novel derivatives. Here, we show that tripodal modifications are accessible by a three&#8208;step lithiation&#8208;small molecule insertion&#8208;hydrolysis protocol involving insertion of isocyanates, isothiocyanates, or a carbodiimide.







Abstract
A widely utilised class of ligands in synthesis and catalysis, &#946;&#8208;diketiminate (BDI) or NacNac compounds were initially considered innocent in the sense that they remained intact in all their applications. That changed when the &#947;&#8208;C&#8722;H unit of their NCCCN backbone was found to engage in reactions with electrophiles. Here, we show that this special reactivity can be used advantageously to prepare tripodal modifications of the common NacNac ligand derived from 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methyldiketimine [NacNacH (Me, Dipp)]. Lithiation to give NacNacLi, followed by reactions with isocyanates, isothiocyanates and a carbodiimide, have afforded a series of tripodal NacNac variants having N,N,N,O; N,N,N,S; or N,N,N,N potential dentation sites, many of which have been crystallographically characterised. Distinct ligating modes of these new ligands have been elucidated through the crystal structures of their lithiated derivatives.

         <title>Fe and Cu Intercalations Enhance SERS of MoO3 through Different Mechanistic Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 15, March 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intercalations of molybdenum trioxide using Fe and Cu lead to outstanding SERS activities through different mechanistic pathways. The Fe intercalation of molybdenum trioxide facilitates the charge transfer pathways for chemical mechanism, while the Cu intercalation enhances surface plasmon resonance by increasing charge carrier density, leading to electromagnetic mechanism.







Abstract
Surface Enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a molecular&#8208;specific analytical technique with various applications. Although electromagnetic (EM) and chemical (CM) mechanisms have been proposed to be the main origins of SERS, exploring highly sensitive SERS substrates with well&#8208;defined mechanistic pathways remains challenging. Since surface and electronic structures of substrates were crucial for SERS activity, zero&#8208;valent transition metals (Fe and Cu) were intercalated into MoO3 to modulate its surface and electronic structures, leading to unexceptional high enhancement factors (1.0&#215;108 and 1.1&#215;1010 for Fe&#8208;MoO3 and Cu&#8208;MoO3, respectively) with decent reproducibility and stability. Interestingly, different mechanistic pathways (CM and EM) were proposed for Fe&#8208;MoO3 and Cu&#8208;MoO3 according to mechanistic investigations. The different mechanisms of Fe&#8208;MoO3 and Cu&#8208;MoO3 were rationalized by the electronic structures of the intercalated Fe(0) and Cu(0), which modulates the surface and electronic structures of Fe&#8208;MoO3 and Cu&#8208;MoO3 to differentiate their SERS mechanisms.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Activity of CO2 Reduction to CO on Cadmium Sulfide Enhanced by Chloride Anion Doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 15, March 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cl/CdS&#8208;NF&#8208;2 cathode exhibits good performance on electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to selectively produce CO in ionic liquid&#8208;based electrolytes. The highest Faradaic efficiency of CO can reach 98.1&#8201;% at &#8722;2.25&#8197;V versus Fc/Fc+ and a maximum jCO can be arrived 192.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;2.35&#8197;V versus Fc/Fc+ on Cl/CdS&#8208;NF&#8208;2 cathode.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR) to produce valuable fuel is a promising process for addressing atmospheric CO2 emissions and energy shortages. In this study, Cl&#8208;anion doped cadmium sulfide structures were directly fabricated on a nickel foam surface (Cl/CdS&#8208;NF) using an in&#8197;situ hydrothermal method. The Cl&#8208;anion doping could significantly improve ECR activity for CO production in ionic liquid and acetonitrile mixed solution, compared to pristine CdS. The highest Faradaic efficiency of CO is 98.1&#8201;% on a Cl/CdS&#8208;NF&#8208;2 cathode with an excellent current density of 137.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;2.25&#8197;V versus ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+, all potentials are versus Fc/Fc+ in this study). In particular, CO Faradaic efficiencies remained above 80&#8201;% in a wide potential range of &#8722;2.05&#8197;V to &#8722;2.45&#8197;V and a maximum partial current density (192.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) was achieved at &#8722;2.35&#8197;V. The Cl/CdS&#8208;NF&#8208;2, with appropriate Cl anions, displayed abundant active sites and a suitable electronic structure, resulting in outstanding ECR activity. Density functional theory calculations further demonstrated that Cl/CdS is beneficial for increasing the adsorption capacities of *COOH and *H, which can enhance the activity of the ECR toward CO and suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction (ECR) to produce valuable fuel is a promising process for addressing atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and energy shortages. In this study, Cl-anion doped cadmium sulfide structures were directly fabricated on a nickel foam surface (Cl/CdS-NF) using an in&#8197;situ hydrothermal method. The Cl-anion doping could significantly improve ECR activity for CO production in ionic liquid and acetonitrile mixed solution, compared to pristine CdS. The highest Faradaic efficiency of CO is 98.1&#8201;% on a Cl/CdS-NF-2 cathode with an excellent current density of 137.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;2.25&#8197;V versus ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, all potentials are versus Fc/Fc&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in this study). In particular, CO Faradaic efficiencies remained above 80&#8201;% in a wide potential range of &#8722;2.05&#8197;V to &#8722;2.45&#8197;V and a maximum partial current density (192.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) was achieved at &#8722;2.35&#8197;V. The Cl/CdS-NF-2, with appropriate Cl anions, displayed abundant active sites and a suitable electronic structure, resulting in outstanding ECR activity. Density functional theory calculations further demonstrated that Cl/CdS is beneficial for increasing the adsorption capacities of *COOH and *H, which can enhance the activity of the ECR toward CO and suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

TOC sentence: A rational design strategy for 2&#8208;pyridone&#8208;based fluorophores with bright emission at long wavelengths is proposed. An intramolecular charge transfer&#8208;based 2&#8208;pyridone fluorophore with large molar absorptivity (&#1013;=20,100&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1), longer emission wavelength (&#955;em=539&#8197;nm), high emission quantum yield (&#981;F=74&#8201;%), and large Stokes shift (&#916;v=5720&#8197;cm&#8722;1) is developed by the strategy.







Abstract
The recent discovery of blue fluorophores with high quantum yields based on pyridone structures inspired the development of new low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight fluorophores with bright emissions at tunable wavelengths, which are highly attractive for various applications. In this study, we propose a rational design strategy for 2&#8208;pyridone&#8208;based fluorophores with bright emissions at long wavelengths. With a detailed understanding of the positional substitution effects on each carbon atom of the 2&#8208;pyridone core, we developed a bright blue fluorophore (&#955;abs=377&#8197;nm; &#955;em=433&#8197;nm; &#1013;=13,200&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1; &#981;F=88&#8201;%) through C3&#8208;aryl and C4&#8208;ester substitutions followed by cyclization. Furthermore, by applying the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) principle, we invented a bright green fluorophore through C3&#8208; and C4&#8208;diester and C6&#8208;aryl substitutions. The ICT fluorophore based on the pyridone structure shows large molar absorptivity (&#1013;=20,100&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1), longer emission wavelength (&#955;em=539&#8197;nm), high emission quantum yield (&#981;F=74&#8201;%), and large Stokes shift (&#916;v=5720&#8197;cm&#8722;1), which are comparable to those of practical fluorescent probes.

         <title>Hexakispyrazolylethane: New Strategy for Stabilization of Hexaarylethane</title>

Hexakis(4&#8208;trimethylsilylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethane was synthesized by the oxidative dimerization of tris(4&#8208;trimethylsilylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methane as a stable analog of hexaphenylethane. Introduction of pyrazole groups allowed additional bridging between the two triarylmethyl moieties through three N&#8722;Ag&#8722;N bonds.







Abstract
Hexakis(4&#8208;trimethylsilylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethane was synthesized by the oxidative dimerization of tris(4&#8208;trimethylsilylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methane. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis of hexakis(4&#8208;trimethylsilylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethane showed that the ethane C&#8722;C bond (1.623(4)&#8197;&#197;) is shorter than that in hexaphenylethane (1.67(3)&#8197;&#197;). In solution, hexakis(4&#8208;trimethylsilylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethane existed as a single species, contrastive that conventional hexaphenylethanes can keep the central C&#8722;C bond only by the aid of additional bridges between the two triarylmethyl units. Theoretical calculations indicated that the tris(pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methyl radical, which is anticipated to be under equilibrium with hexakis(pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethane, is less stable than trityl radicals due to lack of delocalization of the radicals. Furthermore, introduction of pyrazole groups allowed additional bridging between the two triarylmethyl moieties through metal coordination to the adjacent N atoms: hexakis(4&#8208;trimethylsilylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethane exhibited unique coordination to three Ag atoms affording a hexaarylethane analog bearing three N&#8722;Ag&#8722;N bridges.

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Triazolium Covalent Cages for ATP Sensing</title>

Two water&#8208;soluble organic cages were synthesized through a three&#8208;fold click reaction, followed by N&#8208;methylation and anion exchange. The cages bind to the HPTS (8&#8208;hydroxypyrene&#8208;1,3,6&#8208;trisulfonic acid trisodium salt) dye and quench its emission. The cage&#8834;HPTS complexes exhibit turn&#8208;on emission to sense ATP with a nanomolar detection limit, both in water and in human serum matrix.







Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble organic cages are attractive targets for their molecular recognition and sensing features of biologically relevant molecules. Here, we have successfully designed and synthesized a pair of water&#8208;soluble cationic cages employing click reaction as the fundamental step followed by the N&#8208;methylation of the triazole rings. The rigid and shape&#8208;persistent 3D hydrophobic cavity, positively charged surface, H&#8208;bonding triazolium rings, and excellent water solubility empower both cages to exhibit a superior affinity and selectivity for binding with adenosine&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;triphosphate (ATP) compared to cyclophanes and other macrocyclic receptors. Both cage molecules (PCC&#8901;Cl and BCC&#8901;Cl) can bind a highly emissive dye HPTS (8&#8208;hydroxypyrene&#8208;1,3,6&#8208;trisulfonic acid trisodium salt) to form non&#8208;fluorescent complexes. The addition of ATP resulted in the stronger cage&#8834;ATP complexes with the retention of HPTS emission upon its displacement. The resultant indicator&#8208;displacement assay system can efficiently sense and quantify ATP in nanomolar detection limits in buffer solutions and human serum matrix. Spectroscopic and theoretical studies revealed the synergistic effect of &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interaction between the aromatic moiety of the cationic cages and the adenine moiety of ATP, as well as the electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interaction between the phosphate anion of ATP and triazole protons of cages, played the pivotal roles in the sensing process.

         <title>Unmasking the Electrochemical Stability of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Monolayers on Gold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 15, March 12, 2024. </description>

Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) monolayers reveals that NHCs are a stable architecture for electrode modification from &#8722;1&#8197;V to 0.5&#8197;V and for over 40&#8197;hours of continuous voltammetric cycling. However, the NHCs undergo degradation at extreme voltages and after extensive cycling, which raises critical questions about their viability in electrochemical applications.







Abstract
N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) monolayers are transforming electrocatalysis and biosensor design via their increased performance and stability. Despite their increasing use in electrochemical systems, the integrity of the NHC monolayer during voltage perturbations remains largely unknown.

&lt;p&gt;Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) of N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) monolayers reveals that NHCs are a stable architecture for electrode modification from &#8722;1&#8197;V to 0.5&#8197;V and for over 40&#8197;hours of continuous voltammetric cycling. However, the NHCs undergo degradation at extreme voltages and after extensive cycling, which raises critical questions about their viability in electrochemical applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) monolayers are transforming electrocatalysis and biosensor design via their increased performance and stability. Despite their increasing use in electrochemical systems, the integrity of the NHC monolayer during voltage perturbations remains largely unknown. Herein, we deploy surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to measure the stability of two model NHCs on gold in ambient conditions as a function of applied potential and under continuous voltammetric interrogation. Our results illustrate that NHC monolayers exhibit electrochemical stability over a wide voltage window (&#8722;1&#8197;V to 0.5&#8197;V vs Ag|AgCl), but they are found to degrade at strongly reducing (&amp;lt; &#8722;1&#8197;V) or oxidizing (&amp;gt;0.5&#8197;V) potentials. We also address NHC monolayer stability under continuous voltammetric interrogation between 0.2&#8197;V and &#8722;0.5&#8197;V, a commonly used voltage window for sensing, showing they are stable for up to 43&#8197;hours. However, we additionally find that modifications of the backbone NHC structure can lead to significantly shorter operational lifetimes.

         <title>Direct Growth Control of Antibiotic&#8208;Resistant Bacteria Using Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Responsive Novel Photoswitchable Antibiotics</title>

A photoswitchable arylazopyrazole&#8208;modified norfloxacin with MIC of 0.25&#8197;&#956;g/mL of the cis isomer displayed 24&#8208;fold higher antibacterial potency than its trans isomer against norfloxacin&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive S.&#8197;aureus strain MTCC96. The antimicrobial activity can be controlled by visible light with high spatiotemporal precision and retained for &gt;7&#8197;hours. These features render this molecule very attractive for photopharmacology applications.







Abstract
In addition to the discovery of new (modified) potent antibiotics to combat antibiotic resistance, there is a critical need to develop novel strategies that would restrict their off&#8208;target effects and unnecessary exposure to bacteria in our body and environment. We report a set of new photoswitchable arylazopyrazole&#8208;modified norfloxacin antibiotics that present a high degree of bidirectional photoisomerization, impressive fatigue resistance and reasonably high cis half&#8208;lives. The irradiated isomers of most compounds were found to exhibit nearly equal or higher antibacterial activity than norfloxacin against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Notably, against norfloxacin&#8208;resistant S.&#8197;aureus bacteria, the visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive p&#8208;SMe&#8208;substituted derivative showed remarkably high antimicrobial potency (MIC of 0.25&#8197;&#956;g/mL) in the irradiated state, while the potency was reduced by 24&#8208;fold in case of its non&#8208;irradiated state. The activity was estimated to be retained for more than 7&#8197;hours. This is the first report to demonstrate direct photochemical control of the growth of antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria and to show the highest activity difference between irradiated and non&#8208;irradiated states of a photoswitchable antibiotic. Additionally, both isomers were found to be non&#8208;harmful to human cells. Molecular modellings were performed to identify the underlying reason behind the high&#8208;affinity binding of the irradiated isomer to topoisomerase IV enzyme.

         <title>A New Porphyrin&#8208;based Covalent Organic Framework with High Iodine Capture Capacity and I&#8208;doping Enhanced Conductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 15, March 12, 2024. </description>

A novel COF was prepared. Structure of the COF was characterized by PXRD, TEM, BET and CV et&#8197;al. Theoretical simulation fit well in with experimental data, including XRD profile, layer distance, pore size and HOMO/LUMO energy level. The material showed high iodine capture capability and interaction between iodine and framework was studied. After iodine&#8208;doping, enhanced conductivity was observed.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are porous organic materials with well&#8208;defined and uniform structure. The material is an excellent candidate as a solid adsorbent for iodine adsorption. In the present study, we report the synthesis of COF with porphyrin moiety, TF&#8208;TA&#8208;COF, by solvothermal reaction, which was characterized by XRD, solid&#8208;state 13C NMR, IR, TGA, and nitrogen adsorption&#8208;desorption analysis. TF&#8208;TA&#8208;COF showed a high specific surface area of 443&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, and exhibited good adsorption performance for iodine vapor, with an adsorption capacity of 2.74&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1. XPS and Raman spectrum indicated that a hybrid of physisorption and chemisorption took place between host COF and iodine molecules. The electric properties of iodine&#8208;loaded TF&#8208;TA&#8208;COF were also studied. After doped with iodine, the conductivity of the material increased by more than 5 orders of magnitude. The photoconductivity of I2&#8208;doped COF was also studied and TF&#8208;TA&#8208;COF showed doping&#8208;enhanced photocurrent generation.

         <title>Fluorogenic Rhodamine Probes with Pyrrole Substitution Enables STED and Lifetime Imaging of Lysosomes in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 15, March 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrrole substitution produced fluorogenic rhodamine probes with high brightness, large Stokes shift, red&#8208;shifted fluorescence emission and enhanced environmental sensitivity. Good cell permeability, low toxicity and favorable turn on fluorescence response to low polarity, high viscosity as well as acidity facilitate wash&#8208;free high contrast STED and lifetime imaging of lysosomes in live cells.







Abstract
Fluorogenic dyes with high brightness, large turn&#8208;on ratios, excellent photostability, favorable specificity, low cytotoxicity, and high membrane permeability are essential for high&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging in live cells. In this study, we endowed these desirable properties to a rhodamine derivative by simply replacing the N, N&#8208;diethyl group with a pyrrole substituent. The resulting dye, Rh&#8208;NH, exhibited doubled Stokes shifts (54&#8197;nm) and a red&#8208;shift of more than 50&#8197;nm in fluorescence spectra compared to Rhodamine B. Rh&#8208;NH preferentially exists in a non&#8208;emissive but highly permeable spirolactone form. Upon binding to lysosomes, the collective effects of low pH, low polarity, and high viscosity endow Rh&#8208;NH with significant fluorescence turn&#8208;on, making it a suitable candidate for wash&#8208;free, high&#8208;contrast lysosome tracking. Consequently, Rh&#8208;NH enabled us to successfully explore stimulated emission depletion (STED) super&#8208;resolution imaging of lysosome dynamics, as well as fluorescence lifetime imaging of lysosomes in live cells.

         <title>In&#8208;situ Construction of Poly(tetraisopentyl acrylate) based Gel Polymer Electrolytes with LixLa2&#8208;xTiO3 for High Energy Density Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
The LLTO&#8208;containing PAN was prepared by electrostatic spinning as a polymer matrix, which was subsequently used to prepared gel polymer electrolyte by in&#8208;situ polymerization. The obtained gel polymer electrolyte has a high ionic conductivity and lithium&#8208;ion transference number, which assembles to form a high energy density lithium metal battery with excellent performance.







Abstract
As promising alternatives to liquid electrolytes, polymer electrolytes attract much research interest recently, but their widespread use is limited by the low ionic conductivity. In this study, we use electrostatic spinning to introduce particles of an ionic conductor into polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers to prepare a porous membrane as the host of gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs). The relevant in&#8208;situ produced GPE performs a high ionic conductivity of 6.0&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, and a high lithium transfer number (tLi+) of 0.85 at 30&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. A symmetrical Li cell with this GPE can cycle stably for 550&#8197;h at a current density of 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. While the capacity retention of the NCM|GPE|Li cell is 79.84&#8201;% after 500 cycles at 2&#8197;C. Even with an increased cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5&#8197;V, the 1st coulomb efficiency reaches 91.58&#8201;% with a specific discharge capacity of 213.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. This study provides a viable route for the practical application of high energy density lithium metal batteries.

The obtained gel polymer electrolyte has a high ionic conductivity and lithium-ion transference number, which assembles to form a high energy density lithium metal battery with excellent performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As promising alternatives to liquid electrolytes, polymer electrolytes attract much research interest recently, but their widespread use is limited by the low ionic conductivity. In this study, we use electrostatic spinning to introduce particles of an ionic conductor into polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers to prepare a porous membrane as the host of gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs). The relevant in-situ produced GPE performs a high ionic conductivity of 6.0&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and a high lithium transfer number (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;Li&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) of 0.85 at 30&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. A symmetrical Li cell with this GPE can cycle stably for 550&#8197;h at a current density of 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. While the capacity retention of the NCM|GPE|Li cell is 79.84&#8201;% after 500 cycles at 2&#8197;C. Even with an increased cut-off voltage of 4.5&#8197;V, the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; coulomb efficiency reaches 91.58&#8201;% with a specific discharge capacity of 213.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This study provides a viable route for the practical application of high energy density lithium metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction and Application of a Pepsin&#8208;Functionalized Covalent Organic Framework with Prominent Chiral Recognition Ability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 15, March 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pepsin@ Covalent Organic Framework (Pepsin@COF) was constructed for enantioselective adsorption and chromatographic enantioseparation. Serving as a protective &#8220;armor&#8221;, the COF ensures the safeguarding of the enzyme, while the enzyme itself offers sites for chiral recognition. This research uncovers a first&#8208;time correlation between enzyme chiral recognition and activity, expanding biocomposite design and enriching the CSP library.







Abstract
The stable Pepsin@covalent organic framework (Pepsin@COF) were constructed base on matching COF pore diameter to pepsin dimension. It exhibits excellent chiral recognition capabilities (e.&#8201;e.&#8201;% up to 62.63&#8201;%) and potential for enantioseparation. Furthermore, a positive correlation between the immobilized enzyme activity and chiral recognition was revealed, offering insights for the design of biocatalytic nanosystems in chiral separation.

         <title>Photoinduced Dual C&#8722;F Bond Activation of Hexafluorobenzene Mediated by Boron Atom</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 15, March 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Laser&#8208;ablated boron atom reaction with hexafluorobenzene (C6F6) has been performed in neon and argon matrices. Besides the single C&#8722;F bond activation species fluoropentafluorophenyl boryl radical, a 2&#8208;difluoroboryl&#8208;tetrafluorophenyl radical is also generated via dual C&#8722;F bond activation of hexafluorobenzene on subsequent irradiation.







Abstract
The reaction of laser&#8208;ablated boron atoms with hexafluorobenzene (C6F6) was investigated in neon and argon matrices, and the products are identified by matrix isolation infrared spectroscopy and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The reaction is triggered by a boron atom insertion into one C&#8722;F bond of hexafluorobenzene on annealing, forming a fluoropentafluorophenyl boryl radical (A). UV&#8208;Vis light irradiation of fluoropentafluorophenyl boryl radical causes generation of a 2&#8208;difluoroboryl&#8208;tetrafluorophenyl radical (B) via a second C&#8722;F bond activation. A perfluoroborepinyl radical (C) is also observed upon deposition and under UV&#8208;Vis light irradiation. This finding reveals the new example of a dual C&#8722;F bond activation of hexafluorobenzene mediated by a nonmetal and provides a possible route for synthesis of new perfluorinated organo&#8208;boron compounds.

         <title>Boosting Hydrogen Production of a MOF&#8208;based Multicomponent Photocatalyst with Clean Interface via Facile One&#8208;pot Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 15, March 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;pot synthesis represents an attractive strategy for interface engineering to facilitate the charge transfer and separation. This work provides the formation details of MOF&#8208;based multicomponent photocatalysts via facile one&#8208;pot electrosynthesis, which results in clean and direct interfaces that contribute to the efficient hydrogen production to meet the sustainable energy requirement.







Abstract
Hydrogen production from photocatalysis via the usage of multicomponent photocatalysts represents a promising pathway for carbon peaking and carbon neutrality, owing to their structural advantages in dealing with the three crucial processes in photocatalysis, namely, light harvesting, charge transfer, and surface redox reactions. We demonstrate the fabrication of a MOF&#8208;based multicomponent photocatalyst, denoted as semiconductor/MOF/cocatalyst, by a one&#8208;pot electrochemical synthetic route. The as&#8208;fabricated multicomponent photocatalyst has a clean interface among the components, leading to close connections that contribute to high&#8208;quality heterojunction and facilitate photogenerated charge transfer and separation, thereby the efficient hydrogen evolution. The hydrogen production rate of the resultant ZrO2/Zr&#8208;MOF/Pt is 1327&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is much higher than that of ZrO2/Zr&#8208;MOF (15&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) and pure Zr&#8208;MOF (10.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1), as well as the photodeposited&#8208;Pt products ZrO2/Zr&#8208;MOF/PtPD (287&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) and Zr&#8208;MOF/PtPD (192&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) obtained by the step&#8208;wise synthetic approach. The work gives a good inspiration for the rational design and construction of MOF&#8208;based multicomponent photocatalysts through the one&#8208;pot electrosynthesis.

         <title>An Interface&#8208;cascading Silicon Photoanode with Strengthened Built&#8208;in Electric Field and Enriched Surface Oxygen Vacancies for Efficient Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 15, March 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With oxygen vacancy enriched NiFeOOH overlayer introduced, thermodynamically reducing the energy barrier for OER, the obtained n&#8208;Si/CoOx/NiOx/NiFeOOH photoanode exhibits large band bending at the introduced cascading interfaces for promoted charge transfer. This study paves an alternative way to design multilayer structured n&#8208;Si based photoanodes by engineering interfacial band structures and surface defects for efficient PEC water splitting.







Abstract
To promote interfacial charge transfer process and accelerate surface water oxidation reaction kinetics for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting over n&#8208;type Silicon (n&#8208;Si) based photoanodes, herein, starting with surface stabilized n&#8208;Si/CoOx, a NiOx/NiFeOOH composite overlayer was coated by atomic layer deposition and spray coating to fabricate the multilayer structured n&#8208;Si/CoOx/NiOx/NiFeOOH photoanode. Encouragingly, the obtained n&#8208;Si/CoOx/NiOx/NiFeOOH photoanode exhibits much increased PEC activity for water splitting, with onset potential cathodically shifted to ~0.96&#8197;V vs. RHE and photocurrent density increased to 22.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;V vs. RHE for OER, as compared to n&#8208;Si/CoOx, even significantly surpassing the counterpart n&#8208;Si/CoOx/NiOx/FeOOH and n&#8208;Si/CoOx/NiOx/NiOOH photoanodes. Photophysical and electrochemical characterizations evidence that the deposited CoOx/NiOx/NiFeOOH composite overlayer would create large band bending and strong built&#8208;in electric field at the introduced cascading interfaces, thereby producing a large photovoltage of 650&#8197;mV to efficiently accelerate charge transfer from the n&#8208;Si substrate to the electrolyte for water oxidation. Furthermore, the surface oxygen vacancy enriched NiFeOOH overlayer could effectively catalyze the water oxidation reaction by thermodynamically reducing the energy barrier of rate determining step for OER.

&lt;p&gt;To promote interfacial charge transfer process and accelerate surface water oxidation reaction kinetics for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting over n-type Silicon (n-Si) based photoanodes, herein, starting with surface stabilized n-Si/CoO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, a NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/NiFeOOH composite overlayer was coated by atomic layer deposition and spray coating to fabricate the multilayer structured n-Si/CoO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/NiFeOOH photoanode. Encouragingly, the obtained n-Si/CoO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/NiFeOOH photoanode exhibits much increased PEC activity for water splitting, with onset potential cathodically shifted to ~0.96&#8197;V &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. RHE and photocurrent density increased to 22.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.23&#8197;V &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. RHE for OER, as compared to n-Si/CoO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, even significantly surpassing the counterpart n-Si/CoO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/FeOOH and n-Si/CoO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/NiOOH photoanodes. Photophysical and electrochemical characterizations evidence that the deposited CoO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/NiFeOOH composite overlayer would create large band bending and strong built-in electric field at the introduced cascading interfaces, thereby producing a large photovoltage of 650&#8197;mV to efficiently accelerate charge transfer from the n-Si substrate to the electrolyte for water oxidation. Furthermore, the surface oxygen vacancy enriched NiFeOOH overlayer could effectively catalyze the water oxidation reaction by thermodynamically reducing the energy barrier of rate determining step for OER.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stabilization and One Electron Reduction of a Silicon Analogue of a Carboxylic Acid Anhydride</title>

         <dc:description>
Oxidation of two 1,2&#8208;disilylenes and two abnormal N&#8208;heterocyclic silylenes with N2O lead to formation of the first uncoordinated silicon analogues of carboxylic acid anhydrides. Reaction of one with a dimagnesium&#8197;(I) compound proceeds via a one&#8208;electron reduction and formation of a magnesium sila&#8208;acid anhydride radical complexes.







Abstract
Reaction of the 1,2&#8208;disilylenes {(DipArAm)Si}2 (DipArAm=[(NDip)2CAr]&#8722;, Dip=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl, Ar=4&#8208;C6H4But (Ar&#8217;) 1&#8201;a or Ph 1&#8201;b) and two abnormal N&#8208;heterocyclic silylenes, (DipArAm)SiOCSi{(NDip)2CAr} (Ar=Ar&#8217; 3&#8201;a or Ph 3&#8201;b) with N2O led to formation of unprecedented examples of uncoordinated silicon analogues of carboxylic acid anhydrides, (DipArAm)(O=)SiOSi(=O)(DipArAm) (Ar=Ar&#8217; 2&#8201;a or Ph 2&#8201;b). Both compounds have been fully characterized, and the mechanism of formation of one explored using DFT calculations. Reduction of sila&#8208;acid anhydride 2&#8201;a with a dimagnesium(I) compound, [{(MesNacnac)Mg}2] (MesNacnac=[(MesNCMe)2CH]&#8722;, Mes=mesityl), led to the one&#8208;electron reduction of the anhydride and formation of a magnesium complex of a sila&#8208;acid anhydride radical anion [(MesNacnac)Mg{(OSi(DipAr&#8217;Am)}2O] 5. A combination of EPR spectroscopic studies and DFT calculations reveal the unpaired electron to largely reside on one of the amidinate ligands of the complex.

         <title>Metal Influence on Cyaphide&#8208;Azide 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition Reactions: Aromaticity and Activation Strain</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 15, March 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of the metal fragment on the cyaphide&#8208;azide 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction is computationally explored in detail. Whereas there is no impact on the aromaticity of the corresponding concerted transition states, a significant influence on the barrier of the cycloaddition, particularly for germanium and magnesium complexes, is found.







Abstract
The factors governing 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions involving C&#8801;P&#8208;containing compounds are computationally explored in detail using quantum chemical tools. To this end, the parent process involving tBuN3 and tBuCP is analyzed and compared to the analogous reaction involving organometallic cyaphide complexes (metal=Au, Pt, Ge, Mg), in order to understand the role of the metal fragment in such transformations. It is found that while the metal fragment does not significantly influence the aromaticity of the corresponding concerted transition states or the regioselectivity of the transformation, it may modify the reactivity of the cyaphide complexes (i.&#8201;e. Ge and Mg cyaphide complexes are comparatively more reactive). The computed reactivity trends and the factors behind the regioselectivity of the cycloaddition reaction are quantitatively analyzed with the help of the activation strain model in combination with the energy decomposition analysis method.

         <title>Boosting Energy&#8208;Transfer Processes via Dispersion Interactions</title>

We present the generalized beneficial effect of naphthalene and its simple derivatives on energy&#8208;transfer reactions. Increased reactions rates and higher yields are achieved for several reactivities, varying substrates, solvents, light sources and photocatalysts. The consistent trend is observed using molar excess of naphthalene or a catalytic amount of tailored bi&#8208;naphthyl derivatives. These findings can be broadly used to improve existing methods as well as to shrink the efforts required to develop new ones.







Abstract
The generation of open&#8208;shell intermediates under mild conditions has opened broad synthetic opportunities during this century. However, these reactive species often require a case specific and tailored tuning of experimental parameters in order to efficiently convert substrates into products. We report a general approach that can overcome these ubiquitous limitations for several visible&#8208;light promoted energy&#8208;transfer processes. The use of either naphthalene (5&#8211;20&#8197;equiv.) or simple binaphthyl derivatives (10&#8211;30&#8197;mol&#8201;%) greatly increases their efficiency, giving rise to a new strategy for catalysis. The trend is consistent among different media, photocatalysts, light sources and substrates, allowing one to improve existing methods, to more easily optimize conditions for new ones, and, moreover, to disclose otherwise inaccessible reaction pathways.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Promoted Biocompatible Selenium Arylation of Small Molecules, Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 15, March 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organometallic gold(III) compounds are introduced here as a valuable addition to the toolkit of metal&#8208;based systems apt at facilitating selenium arylation, with applications spanning from synthetic chemistry to selenoprotein modification. By combining multinuclear NMR, LC&#8211;MS and DFT we show that the compound [Au(bnpy)Cl2] enables the arylation of diselenides and selenols present in small molecules, peptides, and proteins via a redox&#8208;based mechanism.







Abstract
A low pKa (5.2), high polarizable volume (3.8&#8197;&#197;), and proneness to oxidation under ambient conditions make selenocysteine (Sec, U) a unique, natural reactive handle present in most organisms across all domains of life. Sec modification still has untapped potential for site&#8208;selective protein modification and probing. Herein we demonstrate the use of a cyclometalated gold(III) compound, [Au(bnpy)Cl2], in the arylation of diselenides of biological significance, with a scope covering small molecule models, peptides, and proteins using a combination of multinuclear NMR (including 77Se&#8201;NMR), and LC&#8211;MS. Diphenyl diselenide (Ph&#8722;Se)2 and selenocystine, (Sec)2, were used for reaction optimization. This approach allowed us to demonstrate that an excess of diselenide (Au/Se&#8722;Se) and an increasing water percentage in the reaction media enhance both the conversion and kinetics of the C&#8722;Se coupling reaction, a combination that makes the reaction biocompatible. The C&#8722;Se coupling reaction was also shown to happen for the diselenide analogue of the cyclic peptide vasopressin ((Se&#8722;Se)&#8208;AVP), and the Bos taurus glutathione peroxidase (GPx1) enzyme in ammonium acetate (2&#8197;mM, pH=7.0). The reaction mechanism, studied by DFT revealed a redox&#8208;based mechanism where the C&#8722;Se coupling is enabled by the reductive elimination of the cyclometalated Au(III) species into Au(I).

Diphenyl diselenide (Ph&#8722;Se)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and selenocystine, (Sec)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, were used for reaction optimization. This approach allowed us to demonstrate that an excess of diselenide (Au/Se&#8722;Se) and an increasing water percentage in the reaction media enhance both the conversion and kinetics of the C&#8722;Se coupling reaction, a combination that makes the reaction biocompatible. The C&#8722;Se coupling reaction was also shown to happen for the diselenide analogue of the cyclic peptide vasopressin ((Se&#8722;Se)-AVP), and the &lt;i&gt;Bos taurus&lt;/i&gt; glutathione peroxidase (GPx1) enzyme in ammonium acetate (2&#8197;mM, pH=7.0). The reaction mechanism, studied by DFT revealed a redox-based mechanism where the C&#8722;Se coupling is enabled by the reductive elimination of the cyclometalated Au(III) species into Au(I).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stability of the Protactinium(V) Mono&#8208;Oxo Cation Probed by First&#8208;Principle Calculations</title>

Protactinium (Z=91) deviates from the neighboring actinides by forming PaO3+ in solution instead of PaO2+. Complex stability, evaluated through Gibbs free energy, favors PaO(OH)2(X)(H2O) with Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, I&#8722;, NCS&#8722;, NO3&#8722; and SO42&#8722;, but not with OH&#8722;, F&#8722; and C2O42&#8722;. QTAIM and NBO analyses reveal a triple bond in Pa mono&#8208;oxo bond, with increased covalency Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, I&#8722;, NCS&#8722;, NO3&#8722; providing insights into protactinium's unique chemical behavior.







Abstract
This study explores the distinctive behavior of protactinium (Z=91) within the actinide series. In contrast to neighboring elements like uranium or plutonium, protactinium in the pentavalent state diverges by not forming the typical dioxo protactinyl moiety PaO2+ in aqueous phase. Instead, it manifests as a monooxo PaO3+ cation or a Pa5+. Employing first&#8208;principle calculations with implicit and explicit solvation, we investigate two stoichiometrically equivalent neutral complexes: PaO(OH)2(X)(H2O) and Pa(OH)4(X), where X represents various monodentate and bidentate ligands. Calculating the Gibbs free energy for the reaction PaO(OH)2(X)(H2O)&#8594;Pa(OH)4(X), we find that the PaO(OH)2(X)(H2O) complex is stabilized with Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, I&#8722;, NCS&#8722;, NO3&#8722;, and SO42&#8722; ligands, while it is not favored with OH&#8722;, F&#8722;, and C2O42&#8722; ligands. Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) and Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) methods reveal the Pa mono&#8208;oxo bond as a triple bond, with significant contributions from the 5f and 6d shells. Covalency of the Pa mono&#8208;oxo bond increases with certain ligands, such as Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, I&#8722;, NCS&#8722;, and NO3&#8722;. These findings elucidate protactinium's unique chemical attributes and provide insights into the conditions supporting the stability of relevant complexes.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Chemodivergent Coupling of Alcohols: Efficient Routes to Access &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Disubstituted Ketones and &#945;&#8208;Substituted Chalcones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 15, March 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemodivergent nickel&#8208;catalyzed approach provides &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted ketones from aryl&#8208;substituted secondary alcohols and benzyl alcohols via the borrowing hydrogen (BH) strategy in the presence of KOtBu, whereas exclusively &#945;&#8208;substituted chalcones were accomplished in the presence of mild base K2CO3 through an acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling (ADC) strategy.







Abstract
Chemodivergent (de)hydrogenative coupling of primary and secondary alcohols is achieved utilizing an inexpensive nickel catalyst, (6&#8208;OH&#8208;bpy)NiCl2. This protocol demonstrates the synthesis of branched carbonyl compounds, &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted ketones, and &#945;&#8208;substituted chalcones via borrowing hydrogen strategy and acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling, respectively. A wide range of aryl&#8208;based secondary alcohols are coupled with various primary alcohols in this tandem dehydrogenation/hydrogenation reaction. The nickel catalyst, along with KOtBu or K2CO3, governed the selectivity for the formation of branched saturated ketones or chalcones. A preliminary mechanistic investigation confirms the reversible dehydrogenation of alcohols to carbonyls via metal&#8208;ligand cooperation (MLC) and the involvement of radical intermediates during the reaction.

         <title>CBe2H5&#8722;: Unprecedented 2&#963;/2&#960; Double Aromaticity and Dynamic Structural Fluxionality in a Planar Tetracoordinate Carbon Cluster</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 15, March 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 14&#8208;electron ternary anionic CBe2H5&#8722; cluster with a planar tetracoordinate carbon center is reported. Unprecedentedly, two ligand hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon rotate alternately, leading to it exhibiting interesting dynamic fluxionality that can be regarded as a molecular rotor.







Abstract
A 14&#8208;electron ternary anionic CBe2H5&#8722; cluster containing a planar tetracoordinate carbon (ptC) atom is designed herein. Remarkably, it can be stabilized by only two beryllium atoms with both &#960;&#8208;acceptor/&#963;&#8208;donor properties and two hydrogen atoms, which means that the conversion from planar methane (transition state) to ptC species (global minimum) requires the substitution of only two hydrogen atoms. Moreover, two ligand H atoms exhibit alternate rotation, giving rise to interesting dynamic fluxionality in this cluster. The electronic structure analysis reveals the flexible bonding positions of ligand H atoms due to C&#8722;H localized bonds, highlighting the rotational fluxionality in the cluster, and two CBe2 3c&#8211;2e delocalized bonds endow its rare 2&#963;/2&#960; double aromaticity. Unprecedentedly, the fluxional process exhibits a conversion in the type of bonding (&#963; bond&#8596;&#960; bond), which is an uncommon fluxional mechanism. The cluster can be seen as an attempt to apply planar hypercoordinate carbon species to molecular motors.

         <title>More Electropositive is More Electronegative: Atom Size Determines C=X Group Electronegativity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 15, March 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
More electropositive is more electronegative! The C=X group electronegativity is increased when the electronegativity of X is decreased down a group of the Periodic Table. Quantum&#8208;chemical analyses reveal that the steric size of atom X is at the origin of this counterintuitive and unexpected phenomenon.

Opposite to what one might expect, we find that the C=X group can become effectively more, not less, electronegative when the Pauling electronegativity of atom X decreases down Groups&#8197;16, 15, and 14 of the Periodic Table. Our quantum&#8208;chemical analyses, show that, and why, this phenomenon is a direct consequence of the increasing size of atom X down a group. These findings can be applied to tuning and improving the hydrogen&#8208;bond donor strength of amides H2NC(=X)R by increasingly withdrawing density from the NH2 group. A striking example is that H2NC(=SiR2)R is a stronger hydrogen&#8208;bond donor than H2NC(=CR2)R.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;More electropositive is more electronegative&lt;/b&gt;! The C=X group electronegativity is increased when the electronegativity of X is decreased down a group of the Periodic Table. Quantum-chemical analyses reveal that the steric size of atom X is at the origin of this counterintuitive and unexpected phenomenon.

Polyamines, such as putrescine and spermidine, are pivotal in various biological processes across living organisms. Despite their significance, structurally modified polyamines offer a less&#8208;explored avenue for discovering bioactive compounds. In this study, we accomplished photoredox&#8208;catalyzed functionalization of polyamines to diversify their structure. The rapid functionalization allows attaching fluorophores to the target polyamine, facilitating the development of molecular probes for advancing chemical biology studies.







Abstract
Polyamines, such as putrescine and spermidine, are pivotal in various biological processes across living organisms. Despite their significance, structurally modified polyamines offer a less&#8208;explored avenue for discovering bioactive compounds. The limitation is attributed to the synthetic difficulty of accessing functionalized polyamines. In this study, we accomplished photoredox&#8208;catalyzed functionalization of polyamines to diversify their structure. The rapid functionalization allows attaching fluorophores to the target polyamine, facilitating the development of molecular probes for advancing chemical biology studies.

In solution, protactinium(V) can exist as a mono&#8208;oxo PaO3+ cation or a Pa5+, a unique feature along the actinide series. The relative stability of these two species has been explored by relativistic correlated quantum chemical methods. The equilibrium graphic highlights that ligands positioned to the right enhance the formation of a Pa mono&#8208;oxo triple bond in the aqueous phase. In contrast, those on the left destabilize this bond making the Pa5+ more stable. More information can be found in the Research Article by V. Vallet and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202304068). The cover design is credited to the graphic designer Ihsan Obeid.

Ionic liquids (ILs), with their unique combination of high ionic conductivity, oxygen solubility, low volatility, and customizable chemical characteristics, serve as versatile tools to enhance various PEMFC components, from membranes and catalysts to electrodes.







Abstract
Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) represent a promising clean energy solution. However, their widespread adoption faces hurdles related to component optimization. This review explores the pivotal role of ionic liquids (ILs) in enhancing PEMFC performance, focusing on their role in polymer electrolyte membranes, catalyst modification, and other components. By addressing key obstacles, including proton conductivity, catalyst stability, and fuel crossover, ILs provide a pathway towards the widespread commercialization of PEMFCs. In the realm of PEMFC membranes, ILs have shown great potential in improving proton conductivity, mechanical strength, and thermal stability. Additionally, the utilization of ILs as catalyst modifiers has shown promise in enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of electrodes by serving as an effective stabilizer to promote the dispersion of metal nanoparticles, and reduce their agglomeration, thereby augmenting catalytic performance. Furthermore, ILs can be tailored to optimize the catalyst&#8208;support interaction, ultimately enhancing the overall fuel cell efficiency. Their unique properties, such as high oxygen solubility and low volatility, offer advantages in terms of reducing mass transport and water management issues. This review not only underscores the promising advancements achieved thus far but also outlines the challenges that must be addressed to unlock the full potential of ILs in PEMFC technology, offering a valuable resource for researchers and engineers working toward the realization of efficient and durable PEMFCs.

         <title>Liquid Crystalline Nanoparticles via Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly: Morphology Evolution and Function Regulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 15, March 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarized the morphology evolution, stimuli&#8208;responsiveness and potential application of liquid crystalline (LC) nanoassemblies by polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly(PISA). Under the regulation of LC ordering and PISA process, LC nanoassemblies showed abundant morphologies and specific formation evolution. According to the LC mesogen, the studies were divided into fluoro&#8208;containing, azobenzene, poly(p&#8208;phenylene terephthalamide) (PPTA) and others to be introduced respectively.







Abstract
Liquid crystalline nanoparticles (LC NPs) are a kind of polymer NPs with LC mesogens, which can form special anisotropic morphologies due to the influence of LC ordering. Owing to the stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of the LC blocks, LC NPs show abundant morphology evolution behaviors in response to external regulation. LC NPs have great application potential in nano&#8208;devices, drug delivery, special fibers and other fields. Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) method can synthesize LC NPs at high solid content, reducing the harsh demand for reaction solvent of the LC polymers, being a better choice for large&#8208;scale production. In this review, we introduced recent research progress of PISA&#8208;LC NPs by dividing them into several parts according to the LC mesogen, and discussed the improvement of experimental conditions and the potential application of these polymers.

         <title>Double Four Ring Units&#8208;Containing Zeolites: Synthesis, Structural Modification and Catalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 15, March 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides an overview of three categories of d4r&#8208;containing zeolites: germanosilicates, silicates, and aluminosilicates. A new classification rule, based on the difference in the connection modes between the d4r units and Si&#8208;rich frameworks, is carried out on these structurally specific zeolites. Various synthetic approaches are discussed and compared for developing novel germanosilicates, inducing structural transformation and stabilizing the frameworks.







Abstract
In zeolite frameworks, double four&#8208;ring (d4r) configurations are among the most frequent composite building units. The composition variations in d4r units greatly influence the energy and structural modifiability of the zeolitic framework. The introduction of germanium, with a larger ionic radius than silicon or aluminum, not only reduces the energy constraints of d4r in the nucleation and crystal growth of zeolites, but also opens a new window for constructing novel crystalline structures, especially with large or extra&#8208;large pores and channels. Ge&#8208;enriched d4r units endow germanosilicates with structure diversity readily for post treatments. Promising catalytic materials have been gradually developed and increasingly studied by direct synthesis or post&#8208;synthetic isomorphous substitution for Ge. This review focuses on the recent progress in the synthesis, modification, and catalytic application of d4r&#8208;containing zeolites, including germanosilicates, aluminosilicates, and silicates.

         <title>Relation between conformation and activity on islet amyloid polypeptide aggregation of fluorinated foldamers based on N&#8208;difluoromethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;triazole amino acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel fluorinated foldamers based on aminomethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;difluoroacetic acid (1,4&#8208;Tz&#8208;CF2) units were synthesized and their conformational behaviour was studied by NMR and molecular dynamics. Their activity on the aggregation of the human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) amyloid protein was evaluated by fluorescence spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The fluorine labelling of these foldamers allowed the analysis of their interaction with the target protein. We demonstrated that the preferred extended conformation of homotriazolamers of 1,4&#8208;Tz&#8208;CF2 unit increases the aggregation of hIAPP, while the hairpin&#8208;like conformation of more flexible heterotriazolamers containing two 1,4&#8208;Tz&#8208;CF2 units mixed with natural amino acids from the hIAPP sequence reduces it, and more efficiently than the parent natural peptide. The longer heterotriazolamers having three 1,4&#8208;Tz&#8208;CF2 units adopting more folded hairpin&#8208;like and ladder&#8208;like structures similar to short multi&#8208;stranded &#946;&#8208;sheets have no effect.

         <title>Pnictogen&#8208;Rich Heterocycles Derived from a Phosphadiazonium Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, a phosphadiazonium cation has been used to create functional heterocycles. DFT calculations confirm that the Mes*NP group is directly implicated in the generation of the unique photophysical and redox properties observed opening the door for the further development of new families of pnictogen&#8208;rich, &#960;&#8208;conjugated heterocycles.







Abstract
Heterocycles that pair main group elements and nitrogen are extremely important within the &#960;&#8208;conjugated heterocycles research community. Compared to the vast number of boron&#8208;nitrogen heterocycles, those that include phosphorus are less common. Furthermore, the use of phosphorus&#8208;nitrogen triple bonds of any type to prepare such compounds is unprecedented. Here, we pair pyridyl hydrazonide ligands with phosphadiazonium cations and demonstrate that the chelated Mes*NP group is directly implicated in the photophysical and redox properties observed for the resulting heterocycles. In doing so, we introduce a novel building block for the production of phosphorus&#8208;containing heterocycles that could find use in small molecule activation and catalysis or as the functional component of emerging organic electronics.

         <title>Fenton&#8208;Like Reaction: Recent Advances and New Trends</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, the mechanisms of five Fenton reactions are described in detail, and the carefully selected Fenton reagents and systems are discussed. Finally, the typical applications of Fenton reactions in the treatment of soil oil, landfill leachate, textile wastewater and antibiotics are summarized and prospected.







Abstract
The Fenton reaction refers to the reaction in which ferrous ions (Fe2+) produce hydroxyl radicals and other reactive oxidizing substances by decomposing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). This paper reviews the mechanism, application system, and materials employed in the Fenton reaction including conventional homogeneous and non&#8208;homogeneous Fenton reactions as well as photo&#8208;, electrically&#8208;, ultrasonically&#8208;, and piezoelectrically&#8208;triggered Fenton reactions, and summarizes the applications in the degradation of soil oil pollutions, landfill leachate, textile wastewater, and antibiotics from a practical point of view. The mineralization paths of typical pollutant are elucidated with relevant case studies. The paper concludes with a summary and outlook of the further development of Fenton&#8208;like reactions.

         <title>Pertechnetates &#8211; A Structural Study Across the Periodic Table</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The number of pertechnetate salts has been extended for a majority pprox elements pprox periodic table. A systematic crystallographic study of their coordination and level of hydration gives insight into periodic trends. The picture shows the M&#8722;Otc bond lengths of all known pertechnetates.







Abstract
The number of crystal structures of pertechnetates derived from aqueous solutions has been expanded from seven to over 30. We report the conversion of NH4TcO4 to aqueous HtcO4 via acidic cation exchange. This is followed by the synthesis and structural elucidation of pertechnetate salts of alkaline earth (AE), transition metal I and lanthanoids (Ln) elements. Various degrees of hydration and coordination are discussed. Where possible, a comparison with the perrhenate homologues is made. The described syntheses and materials may be used as novel starting materials for extended technetium research.

This is followed by the synthesis and structural elucidation of pertechnetate salts of alkaline earth (AE), transition metal I and lanthanoids (Ln) elements. Various degrees of hydration and coordination are discussed. Where possible, a comparison with the perrhenate homologues is made. The described syntheses and materials may be used as novel starting materials for extended technetium research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Binuclear Copper(I) Alkynyl Complexes with Cuprophilic Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binuclear copper(I) alkynyl complexes with ultrashort Cu&#8722;Cu distance are designed and synthesized, which show thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and mechanochromic luminescence (MCL). The cuprophilic interactions can promote spin&#8208;orbit coupling and ligand engineering can achieve adjustable luminescence, which provide design ideas for the building of stimuli&#8208;responsive Cu(I)&#8208;based TADF materials.







Abstract
Copper(I)&#8208;based thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters have been conceived to be promising candidates for display and lighting applications because of their multifarious structures and strong photoluminescence. Herein a string of binuclear Cu(I) complexes bearing pronounced cuprophilic interactions have been designed and synthesized. [Cu2(dppb)2(&#956;2&#8208;&#951;1&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8722;Ph)2] (1&#8201;a) and [Cu2(dppb)2(&#956;2&#8208;&#951;1&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8722;PPXZ)2] (1&#8201;b) display photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 67&#8201;% in doped films and solid states via TADF and exhibit reversible bicolor luminescence switching upon mechanical stimuli. Computational studies manifest that the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer predominant transitions ensure a small energy splitting (&#916;EST) between the lowest singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) excited states and cuprophilic interactions promote the spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC), favoring the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process. This study provides a new strategy for the construction of stimuli&#8208;responsive metal&#8208;based TADF materials.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonylation Reaction of Indole/Pyrrole Involving HCFO&#8208;1233zd (E)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method for synthesizing trifluoromethylated 3&#8208;indoleketones by Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation was introduced. In the absence of additives, 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropyl (an inexpensive and environmentally friendly synthetic block of trifluoromethyl) reacts with indole and carbon monoxide to generate trifluoromethylindole ketones with good yields, regioselectivity, and chemical selectivity; furthermore, the products exhibit strong resistance to basic functional groups, such as alkynes, aldehydes, and esters.







Abstract
3&#8208;Indole&#8208;3&#8208;one is a key intermediate in the synthesis of many drugs and plays an important role in synthetic chemistry and biochemistry. A new method for synthesizing trifluoromethylated 3&#8208;indoleketones by Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation was introduced. In the absence of additives, 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropyl (an inexpensive and environmentally friendly synthetic block of trifluoromethyl) reacts with indole and carbon monoxide to generate trifluoromethylindole ketones with good yields, regioselectivity, and chemical selectivity; furthermore, the products exhibit strong resistance to basic functional groups, such as alkynes, aldehydes, and esters. In addition to the conversion of indole compounds into corresponding products, pyrrole and heteroindole may be suitable for corresponding chemical transformations. This study provides a synthetic method for the further construction of trifluoromethylated 3&#8208;indole ketones.

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization, and Catalytic Application of Colloidal and Supported Manganese Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colloidal manganese nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized and characterized, with the reaction parameters optimized to yield small and well&#8208;dispersed NPs. Immobilization of the manganese NPs on a supported ionic liquid phase and application in the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of aldehydes and ketones showed that the oxidation state of manganese strongly influences the catalytic activity.







Abstract
Colloidal and supported manganese nanoparticles were synthesized following an organometallic approach and applied in the catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) of aldehydes and ketones. Reaction parameters for the preparation of colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) were optimized to yield small (2&#8211;2.5&#8197;nm) and well&#8208;dispersed NPs. Manganese NPs were further immobilized on an imidazolium&#8208;based supported ionic phase (SILP) and characterized to evaluate NP size, metal loading, and oxidation states. Oxidation of the Mn NPs by the support was observed resulting in an average formal oxidation state of +2.5. The MnOx@SILP material showed promising performance in the CTH of aldehydes and ketones using 2&#8208;propanol as a hydrogen donor, outperforming previously reported Mn NPs&#8208;based CTH catalysts in terms of metal loading&#8208;normalized turnover numbers. Interestingly, MnOx@SILP were found to lose activity upon air exposure, which correlates with an additional increase in the average oxidation state of Mn as revealed by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopic studies.

         <title>Evolution of a Combined UV/Vis and NMR Setup with Fixed Pathlengths for Mass&#8208;limited Samples</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;in&#8208;one: We present a new combined UV/Vis and NMR setup, which allows for the simultaneous measurement of both spectra on mass&#8208;limited samples. A thorough comparison with existing and separate setups is performed.







Abstract
The investigation of reaction mechanisms is a complex task that usually requires the use of several techniques. To obtain as much information as possible on the reaction and any intermediates &#8211; possibly invisible to one technique &#8211; the combination of techniques is a solution. In this work we present a new setup for combined UV/Vis and NMR spectroscopy and compare it to an established alternative. The presented approach allows a versatile usage of different commercially&#8208;available components like mirrors and fiber bundles as well as different fixed pathlengths according to double transmission or single transmission measurements. While a previous approach is based on a dip&#8208;probe setup for conventional NMR probes, the new one is based on a micro&#8208;Helmholtz coil array (LiquidVoxel&#8482;). This makes the use of rectangular cuvettes possible, which ensure well&#8208;defined pathlengths allowing for quantification of species. Additionally, very low quantities of compound can be analyzed due to the microfabrication and small cuvette size used. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle this new setup for combined UV/Vis and NMR spectroscopy is used to examine a well&#8208;studied photochromic system of the dithienylethene compound class. A thorough comparison of the pros and cons of the two setups for combined UV/Vis and NMR measurements is performed.

         <title>Exploring Spin&#8208;Orbit Effects in a [Cu6Tl]+ Nanocluster Featuring an Uncommon Tl&#8722;H Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [Cu6Tl]+ cluster, [Cu6TlH6(PPh3)6][OTf], exhibits a rare Tl&#8722;H orbital interaction, as ascertained by 1H NMR spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. According to DFT, the 1H chemical shift of the Tl&#8208;adjacent hydride ligands includes 7.7&#8197;ppm of deshielding due to spin&#8208;orbit (SO) effects mainly originating from the heavy Tl atom, which represent an important confirmation of SO effects in heavy element main group hydrides.







Abstract
Reaction of [CuH(PPh3)]6 with 1 equiv. of Tl(OTf) results in formation of [Cu6TlH6(PPh3)6][OTf] ([1]OTf]), which can be isolated in good yields. Variable&#8208;temperature 1H NMR spectroscopy, in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, confirms the presence of a rare Tl&#8722;H orbital interaction. According to DFT, the 1H chemical shift of the Tl&#8208;adjacent hydride ligands of [1]+ includes 7.7&#8197;ppm of deshielding due to spin&#8208;orbit effects from the heavy Tl atom.

&lt;p&gt;The [Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Tl]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cluster, [Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;TlH&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;][OTf], exhibits a rare Tl&#8722;H orbital interaction, as ascertained by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. According to DFT, the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H chemical shift of the Tl-adjacent hydride ligands includes 7.7&#8197;ppm of deshielding due to spin-orbit (SO) effects mainly originating from the heavy Tl atom, which represent an important confirmation of SO effects in heavy element main group hydrides.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaction of [CuH(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; with 1 equiv. of Tl(OTf) results in formation of [Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;TlH&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;][OTf] (&lt;b&gt;[1]OTf]&lt;/b&gt;), which can be isolated in good yields. Variable-temperature &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectroscopy, in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, confirms the presence of a rare Tl&#8722;H orbital interaction. According to DFT, the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H chemical shift of the Tl-adjacent hydride ligands of &lt;b&gt;[1]&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; includes 7.7&#8197;ppm of deshielding due to spin-orbit effects from the heavy Tl atom.

         <title>From Stilbenes to carbo&#8208;Stilbenes: an Encouraging Prospect</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel bis&#8208;carbo&#8208;benzenic molecules, derived from the stilbene parent, are explored beyond carbo&#8208;naphthalene and carbo&#8208;biphenyl. The synthesis, structure, and properties of these carbo&#8208;stilbenes are investigated using experimental and computational methods. The molecules exhibit isomerization, with cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;isomers, and the calculated cis&#8208;isomer shows a helical structure. The UV&#8208;vis spectra display broad bands, and voltammograms indicate classical behavior for carbo&#8208;benzene derivatives.







Abstract
Beyond previously described carbo&#8208;naphthalene and carbo&#8208;biphenyl, a novel type of bis&#8208;carbo&#8208;benzenic molecules is envisaged from the stilbene parent. The synthesis, structure, spectroscopic and electrochemical properties of two such carbo&#8208;stilbenes are described at complementary experimental and computational DFT levels. In the selected targets, the bare skeletal carbo&#8208;mer of carbo&#8208;stilbene is decorated by 8 or 10 phenyl groups, 0 or 2 tert&#8208;butyl groups, and 2 n&#8208;octyl chains, the later substituents being introduced to compensate anticipated solubility issues. As in the parent stilbene series, isomers of the phenylated carbo&#8208;stilbenes are characterized. The cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;isomers are, however, formed in almost equal amounts and could not be separated by either chromatography or crystallization. Nevertheless, due to a slow interconversion at the NMR time scale (up to 55&#8201;&#176;C) the 1H NMR signals of both isomers of the two carbo&#8208;stilbenes could be tentatively assigned. The calculated structure of the cis&#8208;isomer exhibits a helical shape, consistent with the observed magnetic shielding of phenyl p&#8208;CH nuclei residing inside the shielding cone of the facing C18 ring. The presence of the two isomers in solution also gives rise to quite broad UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra with main bands at ca 460, 560 and 710&#8197;nm, and a significant bathochromic shift for the decaphenylated carbo&#8208;stilbene vs the di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;octaphenylated counterpart. Square wave voltammograms do not show any resolution of the two isomers, giving a reversible reduction wave at &#8722;0.65 or &#8722;0.58&#8197;V/SCE, and an irreversible oxidation peak at 1.11&#8197;V/SCE, those values being classical for most carbo&#8208;benzene derivatives. Calculated NICS values (NICS(1)=&#8722;12.5&#177;0.2&#8197;ppm) also indicate that the aromatic nature of the C18 rings is not markedly affected by the dialkynylbutatriene (DAB) connector between them.

         <title>On Haptotropic Rearrangements of Diphosphene and Diarsene Ligands in Titanium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addition of simple Lewis basic ligands L, such as MeCN or CO among others, results in a shift of the hapticity of the dipnictene ligand in titanocene dipnictene complexes Cp2Ti(Pn2R2) (Pn=P, As) from &#951;2 to &#951;1. While the starting complexes are TiIV species the &#951;1 complexes are best described as singlet biradicals with antiferromagnetically coupled [Cp2TiIII]&#8901;+&#8901; and [Pn2R2]&#8901;&#8722; fragments as verified by computational studies.







Abstract
Dipnictenes of the type RE=ER (E=P, As, Sb, Bi) are the isovalence electronic heavier analogs of alkenes. Although diphosphenes and dipnictenes in general show a variety of binding modes in metal complexes, little is known about haptotropic shift reactions involving these ligands. Herein, we report an unprecedented &#951;2 to &#951;1 rearrangement of the dipnictene ligands in titanocene complexes of the type Cp2Ti(Pn2Ar2) (Pn=P, As; Ar=2,4,6&#8208;Me3&#8208;C6H2, Mes; 2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3, Dip; 2,4,6&#8208;iPr3&#8208;C6H2, Tip), initiated by Lewis basic ligands (L=MeCN, PMe3, AdNC, CO). In the presence of L the dipnictene ligand changes its hapticity from &#951;2 to &#951;1 and complexes of the general form Cp2Ti(L)(Pn2Ar2) with a succinctly different electronic structure are obtained. Electronically, the new complexes are best described as biradicaloids with antiferromagnetically coupled (via a &#960;&#8208;bond) [Cp2TiIII]&#8901;+ and [Pn2Ar2]&#8901;&#8722; fragments. However, the biradical character of these systems is affected by the electronic features of the co&#8208;ligand and significantly decreases moving from PMe3/MeCN (&#963;&#8208;donors) to CNAd/CO (&#963;&#8208;donors/&#960;&#8208;acceptors).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RNA one by one. Here, we present a first step towards controlled enzymatic RNA synthesis. We have explored the possibility of a simple protection step of the vicinal cis&#8208;diol moiety to temporarily block ribonucleotides. We demonstrate that pyrimidine nucleotides protected with acetals, particularly 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;isopropylidene, are well&#8208;tolerated by the template&#8208;independent RNA polymerase PUP and highly efficient coupling reactions can be achieved within minutes.







Abstract
Besides being a key player in numerous fundamental biological processes, RNA also represents a versatile platform for the creation of therapeutic agents and efficient vaccines. The production of RNA oligonucleotides, especially those decorated with chemical modifications, cannot meet the exponential demand. Due to the inherent limits of solid&#8208;phase synthesis and in&#8197;vitro transcription, alternative, biocatalytic approaches are in dire need to facilitate the production of RNA oligonucleotides. Here, we present a first step towards the controlled enzymatic synthesis of RNA oligonucleotides. We have explored the possibility of a simple protection step of the vicinal cis&#8208;diol moiety to temporarily block ribonucleotides. We demonstrate that pyrimidine nucleotides protected with acetals, particularly 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;isopropylidene, are well&#8208;tolerated by the template&#8208;independent RNA polymerase PUP (polyU polymerase) and highly efficient coupling reactions can be achieved within minutes &#8211; an important feature for the development of enzymatic de novo synthesis protocols. Even though purines are not equally well&#8208;tolerated, these findings clearly demonstrate the possibility of using cis&#8208;diol&#8208;protected ribonucleotides combined with template&#8208;independent polymerases for the stepwise construction of RNA oligonucleotides.

         <title>Pd(0)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Intramolecular Grignard&#8208;Type Reaction of Vinyl Iodide&#8208;Carbonyl</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Grignard&#8208;type reaction of vinyl iodide&#8208;aldehyde is realized for the first time, which provides facile access to cyclic allylic alcohols with high level of enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. The key to success is the use of HCO2H as additive, which preferentially facilitates protonation of the involved secondary alkyloxyl&#8208;Pd(II) intermediate over the &#946;&#8208;H elimination.







Abstract
The insertion of carbonyl into C(sp2)&#8722;Pd(II) &#963;&#8208;bond (Grignard&#8208;type addition) was not established until the 1990s. While this elemental reaction has been well explored since then, its application in Pd(0) asymmetric catalysis remain elusive. Herein, we report the Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric intramolecular Grignard&#8208;type reaction of vinyl iodide&#8208;carbonyl in the presence of HCO2H additive, affording cyclic allylic alcohol with good to excellent enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggested that besides serving as an efficient reductant, HCO2H is also capable of facilitating protonation of the involved secondary alkoxyl&#8208;Pd(II), thus completely suppressing the &#946;&#8208;H elimination. Moreover, no KIE was found in the competing reaction between vinyl iodide&#8208;aldehyde and 1&#8208;deuterated one, demonstrating the facile step of aldehyde insertion.

         <title>Synthesis of Superelastic, Highly Conductive Graphene Aerogel/Liquid Metal Foam and Its Piezoresistive Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid metal (LM) with a low melting point is dispersed from a surface into nanodroplets by ultrasound and then blended with graphene oxide. By using a bubble template method, a new LM&#8208;modified graphene aerogel (GA/LM) was formed. LM provides more conductive paths on the surface of the graphene nanosheets. The resulting GA/LM has low density, good elasticity, and mechanical stability. It was used as a high&#8208;performance material to produce piezoresistive sensors: one example of the new avenues for applying porous materials and LM in a wide range of fields including wearable sensors, flexible electronics, and robotics. More information can be found in the Research Article by F. Li, Q. Zhang and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303594).

         <title>Superalkalis with Hydrogen as Central Electronegative Atom and their Possible Applications: Ab Initio and DFT Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Superalkalis are unusual species having ionization energies lower than that of the alkali metals. These species with various applications are of great importance in chemistry due to their low ionization energies and strong reducing property. A typical superalkali contains a central electronegative core decorated with excess metal ligands. In the quest for novel superalkalis, we have designed the superalkalis HLi2, HLiNa and HNa2 using hydrogen as central electronegative atom for the first time employing high level ab initio (CCSD(T), MP2) and density functional theory (&#969;B97X&#8208;D) methods. The superalkalis exhibit very low ionization energies, even lower than that of cesium. Stability of these species is verified from binding energy and dissociation energy values. The superalkalis are capable of reducing SO2, NO, CO2, CO and N2 molecules by forming stable ionic complexes and therefore can be used as catalysts for the reduction or activation of systems possessing very low electron affinities. The superalkalis form stable supersalts with tailored properties when interact with a superhalogen. They also show remarkably high non&#8208;linear optical responses, hence could have industrial applications. It is hoped that this work will enrich the superalkali family and spur further theoretical and experimental research in this direction.</dc:description>

         <title>Injectable Chitosan Hydrogels Doped with 2D Peptide Nanosheet&#8208;Drug Conjugates for Glutathione&#8208;Responsive Sustained Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of novel and effective drug delivery systems aimed at enhancing therapeutic profile and efficacy of therapeutic agents is a critical challenge in modern medicine. This study presents an intelligent drug delivery system based on self&#8208;assembled two&#8208;dimensional peptide nanosheets (2D PNSs). Leveraging the tunable properties of amino acid structures and sequences, we design a peptide with the sequence of Fmoc&#8208;FKKGSHC, which self&#8208;assembles into 2D PNSs with uniform structure, high biocompatibility, and excellent degradability. Covalent attachment of thiol&#8208;modified doxorubicin (DOX) drugs to 2D PNSs via disulfide bonds results in the peptide&#8208;drug conjugates (PDCs), which is denoted as PNS&#8208;SS&#8208;DOX. Subsequently, PDCs are encapsulated within the injectable, thermosensitive chitosan (CS) hydrogels for drug delivery. The designed drug delivery system demonstrates outstanding pH&#8208;responsiveness and sustained drug release capabilities, which are facilitated by the characteristics of the CS hydrogels. Meanwhile, the covalently linked disulfide bond within PNS&#8208;SS&#8208;DOX is responsive to the intracellular glutathione (GSH) within tumor cells, enabling controlled drug release and significantly inhibiting cancer cell growth. This responsive peptide&#8208;drug conjugate based on a 2D peptide nanoplatform paves the way for the development of smart drug delivery systems and has bright prospects in the future biomedicine field.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the crystal growth of DNA molecules via strategic chemical modifications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intermolecular interactions are critical to the crystallization of biomolecules, yet the precise control of biomolecular crystal growth based on these interactions remains elusive. To understand the connections between the crystallization kinetics and the strength of intermolecular interactions, herein we have employed DNA triangular crystals and modified ones as a versatile tool to investigate how the strength of intermolecular interaction affects crystal growth. Interestingly, we have found that the 2&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;methylation at sticky ends of the DNA triangle could strengthen its intermolecular interaction, resulting in the accelerated formation of smaller crystals. Conversely, phosphorothioate modification could weaken the sticky&#8208;end cohesion, leading to slower growth of fewer but larger crystals. In addition, these modification effects were consistently observed in the crystallization of a DNA decamer. In one word, our experimental results demonstrate that the strength of intermolecular interaction directly impacts crystal growth. It suggests that 2'&#8208;O&#8208;methylation and phosphorothioate modification represents a rational strategy for controlling DNA molecules grow into desired crystals and it also facilitates structural determination.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging Pyrazolium Ylide Reactivity to Access Indolizine and 1,2&#8208;Dihydropyrimidine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;Heterocyclic ylides are important synthetic precursors to rapidly build molecular complexity. Pyrazolium ylides have largely been unexplored, and we demonstrate their diverse utility in this report. We show that these readily accessible building blocks can be used to construct different heterocyclic skeletons by varying the coupling partner. Indolizines can be formed via an N&#8208;deletion type mechanism when reacting pyrazolium salts with electron deficient alkynes. 1,2&#8208;Dihydropyrimidines can be formed via a rearrangement mechanism when reacting pyrazolium ylides with isocyanates. These reactions enable access to valuable heteroarenes without the need for transition metal catalysis, high temperatures, or strong bases.</dc:description>

         <title>Suppressing cis/trans &#8216;Ring&#8208;flipping&#8217; in Organoaluminium(III)&#8208;2&#8208;pyridyl Dimers &#8211; Design Strategies Towards Lewis Acid Catalysts for Alkene Oligomerisation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to its high natural abundance compared to the commonly used transition (precious) metals, as well as its high Lewis acidity and ability to change oxidation state, aluminium has recently been explored as the basis for a range of single&#8208;site catalysts. This paper aims to establish the ground rules for the development of a new type of cationic alkene oligomerisation catalyst containing two Al(III) ions, with the potential to act co&#8208;operatively in stereoselective assembly. Five new dimers of the type [R2Al(2&#8208;py')]2 (R = Me, iBu; py' = substituted pyridyl group) with different substituents on the Al atoms and pyridyl rings have been synthesised. The formation of the undesired cis isomers can be suppressed by the presence of substituents on the 6&#8208;position of the pyridyl ring due to steric congestion, with DFT calculations showing that the selection of the trans isomer is thermodynamically controlled. Calculations show that demethylation of the dimers [Me2Al(2&#8208;py')]2 with Ph3C+ to the cations [{MeAl(2&#8208;py&#8217;)}2(m&#8208;Me)]+ is highly favourable and that the desired trans disposition of the 2&#8208;pyridyl ring units is influenced by steric effects. Preliminary experimental studies confirm that demethylation of [Me2Al(6&#8208;MeO&#8208;2&#8208;py)]2 can be achieved using [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4].</dc:description>

         <title>Co(II) Substitution Enhances the Esterase Activity of a de Novo Designed Zn(II) Carbonic Anhydrase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Co(II) analogue of the designed peptide Zn(II)(TRIL23H)3 is made as a spectroscopic probe for the carbonic anhydrase activity exhibited by this de novo designed system. The coordination geometry of Co(II) and Zn(II) are vastly different at high and low pH. Nonetheless, the Co(II) analogue at high pH exceeds the catalytic efficiency of the parent Zn(II) protein.







Abstract
Carbonic Anhydrases (CAs) have been a target for de&#8197;novo protein designers due to the simplicity of the active site and rapid rate of the reaction. The first reported mimic contained a Zn(II) bound to three histidine imidazole nitrogens and an exogenous water molecule, hence closely mimicking the native enzymes&#8217; first coordination sphere. Co(II) has served as an alternative metal to interrogate CAs due to its d7 electronic configuration for more detailed solution characterization. We present here the Co(II) substituted [Co(II)(H2O/OH&#8722;)]N(TRIL2WL23H)3n+ that behaves similarly to native Co(II) substituted human&#8208;CAs. Like the Zn(II) analogue, the cobalt&#8208;derivative at slightly basic pH is incapable of hydrolyzing p&#8208;nitrophenylacetate (pNPA); however, as the pH is increased a significant activity develops, which at pH values above 10 eventually yields a catalytic efficiency that exceeds that of the [Zn(II)(OH&#8722;)]N(TRIL2WL23H)3+ peptide complex. X&#8208;ray absorption analysis is consistent with an octahedral species at pH&#8197;7.5 that converts to a 5&#8208;coordinate species by pH&#8197;11. UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy can monitor this transition, giving a pKa for the conversion of 10.3. We assign this conversion to the formation of a 5&#8208;coordinate Co(II)(Nimid)3(OH)(H2O) species. The pH dependent kinetic analysis indicates the maximal rate (kcat), and thus the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km), follow the same pH profile as the spectroscopic conversion to the pentacoordinate species. This correlation suggests that the chemically irreversible ester hydrolysis corresponds to the rate determining process.

         <title>Combined Covalent and Supramolecular Polymerization to Reinforce Perylenebisimide Photosynthetic &#8220;Quantasomes&#8221;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the paired function of Photosystem II (PSII) supercomplexes, artificial quantasomes (QS) are formed by encapsulating the deca&#8208;anionic oxygen&#8208;evolving catalyst Ru4POM within a multichromophoric &#8220;corolla&#8221; of cationic perylenebisimides. Covalent fixation of the QS supramolecular network is obtained herein by photo&#8208;polymerization of styrene terminals installed on the PBI antennas (QS&#8208;PolyS), enhancing the oxygenic photocurrent and stability under high solar irradiance.







Abstract
PSII&#8208;inspired quantasomes have emerged as promising artificial photosystems evolving oxygen from water due to their integrated multi&#8208;chromophore asset, hierarchical architecture, and efficient light&#8208;harvesting capabilities. In this study, we adopt a combined covalent and supramolecular strategy by implementing a poly&#8208;styrene backbone that reinforces proximity and pairing between adjacent perylenebisimide (PBI) quantasome units. The covalent fixation of the quantasome network results in a significant enhancement of the photoelectrocatalytic performance on engineered IO&#8208;ITO photoanodes, with up to 290&#8201;% photocurrent increase (J up to 100&#8197;&#956;A cm&#8722;2, &#955; &gt;450&#8197;nm, applied bias &lt;1.23&#8197;V vs RHE, F.E.O2 &gt;80&#8201;%) compared to the non&#8208;polymerized analog. Moreover, the direct PBI&#8208;quantasome polymerization on the photoanode surface was performed by light irradiation of the radical initiator 2,2&#8217;&#8208;Azobis(2&#8208;methylpropionamidine), improving the photoelectrode robustness under high solar irradiance (&gt;8 suns) and limiting the photocurrent loss (&lt;20&#8201;%) at 1.52&#8197;V vs RHE compared to the non&#8208;polymerized system.

         <title>Insights into the Mechanism of Neptunium Oxidation to the Heptavalent State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomistic insights in the ozonolysis of Np(V) to form Np(VII) under alkaline conditions and role of co&#8208;solutes in the rate of the oxidation are explored through UV/Vis and vibrational spectroscopic analysis. Additional Density Functional Theory calculations are utilized to understand the mechanism of the oxidation reaction and possible intermediate species.







Abstract
Neptunium can exist in multiple oxidation states, including the rare and poorly understood heptavalent form. In this work, we monitored the formation of heptavalent neptunium [Np(VII)O4(OH)2]3&#8722; during ozonolysis of aqueous MOH (M=Li, Na, K) solutions using a combined experimental and theoretical approach. All experimental reactions were closely monitored via absorption and vibrational spectroscopy to follow both the oxidation state and the speciation of neptunium guided by the calculated vibrational frequencies for various neptunium species. The mechanism of the reaction partly involves oxidative dissolution of transient Np(VI) oxide/hydroxide solid phases, the identity of which are dependent on the co&#8208;precipitating counter&#8208;cation Li+/Na+/K+. Additional calculations suggest that the most favorable energetic pathway occurs through the reaction of a [Np(V)O2(OH)4]3&#8722; with the hydroxide radical to form [Np(VI)O2(OH)4]2&#8722;, followed by an additional oxidation with HO&#8901; to create [Np(VII)O4(OH)2]3&#8722;.

         <title>Flowmicro In&#8208;Line Analysis&#8208;Driven Design of Reactions mediated by Unstable Intermediates: Flash Monitoring Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flash monitoring: Direct observation of anionic polymerizing methacrylates was achieved by utilizing flow microreactors, which can transfer the unstable intermediates to spectroscopic instrument before they decompose. The in&#8208;line analysis of poly(methacrylate) anions revealed their structure, stability, and livingness, enabling the anionic polymerization and copolymerization of oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylates.







Abstract
The direct observation of reactive intermediates is an important issue for organic synthesis. However, intermediates with an extreme instability are hard to be monitored by common spectroscopic methods such as FTIR. We have developed synthetic method utilizing flow microreactors, which enables a generation and reactions of unstable intermediates. Herein we report that, based on our flowmicro techniques, we developed an in&#8208;line analysis method for reactive intermediates in increments of milliseconds. We demonstrated the direct observation of the living and dead species of the anionic polymerization of alkyl methacrylates. The direct information of the living species enabled the anionic polymerization and copolymerization of oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylates, which is the important but difficult reaction in the conventional method.

         <title>Different Reaction Modes Operating in ansa&#8208;Half&#8208;Sandwich Magnesium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Show me how many ligands you accept, and I will tell you how you react: depending on the number of ligands that the ansa&#8208;half&#8208;sandwich magnesium catalyst can bind, our DFT calculations show that the mechanism proceeds differently with competitive reaction channels.







Abstract
Magnesium&#8208;based catalysts are becoming popular for hydroelementation reactions specially using p&#8208;block reagents. Based on the seminal report from Sch&#228;fer's group (ChemCatChem 2022, 14, e202201007), our study demonstrates that the reaction mechanisms exhibit a far greater degree of complexity than originally presumed. Magnesium has a variety of coordination modes (and access to different hybridizations) which allows this electron&#8208;deficient centre to modulate its catalytic power depending on the &#963;&#8208;donor properties of the reagent. DFT calculations demonstrate several reaction channels closely operating in these versatile catalysts. In addition, variations in limiting energy barriers resulting from catalyst modifications were examined as a function of the Hammett constant, thereby predicting enhanced efficiency in reaction conversions.

         <title>3&#8208;Oxidopyridinium Ions Are Versatile Bioorthogonal Dipoles for Use in Cycloadditions with Cyclooctynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[3+2] cycloadditions between 3&#8208;oxidopyridiniums and the common bioorthogonal reagent dibenzocyclooctyne (DIBO) are kinetically tuned by substitution at the 5 position, where a linear Hammett relationship is seen to favour electron donating groups. Second&#8208;order rate constants on the order of 1&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 have been achieved in acetonitrile at room temperature.







Abstract
3&#8208;oxidopyridinium ions are water stable and soluble heteroaromatic betaines that behave as latent dipoles and undergo a wide variety of cycloadditions. Research into the cycloaddition reactions of 3&#8208;oxidopyridiniums was spearheaded by Alan R. Katritzky and collaborators from the early 1970s until the late 1980s, but they have yet to be used for bioorthogonal applications. Herein we report that 3&#8208;oxidopyridiniums can readily react with 4&#8208;dibenzocyclooctynol (DIBO), a common bioorthogonal handle, in a [3+2] cycloaddition. The mechanism was investigated by altering the electronics of the reaction by changing the substituent on the 5 position of the pyridinium. Electron&#8208;donating 5&#8208;substituents have been shown to significantly increase the rate of the reaction, with bimolecular rate constants ranging from 3.3&#215;10&#8722;4&#8201;s&#8722;1 with 5&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxidopyridinium to 1.07&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 with 5&#8208;amino&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxidopyridinium. 3&#8208;oxidopyridiniums&#8217; appreciable cycloaddition rates and compatibility with bioorthogonally relevant environments give them the potential to be used in a variety of bioconjugation applications.

         <title>Toward Lung Ventilation Imaging Using Hyperpolarized Diethyl Ether Gas Contrast Agent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyperpolarized diethyl ether gas was produced via heterogeneous pairwise parahydrogen addition to ethyl vinyl ether (a.k.a. vinamar) anesthetic gas and employed for a pilot feasibility demonstration to record sub&#8208;second 2D ventilation MRI of excised rabbit lungs on a clinical 0.35 T MRI scanner without any modifications to the scanner's hardware or software.







Abstract
Hyperpolarized 129Xe gas was FDA&#8208;approved as an inhalable contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging of a wide range of pulmonary diseases in December 2022. Despite the remarkable success in clinical research settings, the widespread clinical translation of HP 129Xe gas faces two critical challenges: the high cost of the relatively low&#8208;throughput hyperpolarization equipment and the lack of 129Xe imaging capability on clinical MRI scanners, which have narrow&#8208;bandwidth electronics designed only for proton (1H) imaging. To solve this translational grand challenge of gaseous hyperpolarized MRI contrast agents, here we demonstrate the utility of batch&#8208;mode production of proton&#8208;hyperpolarized diethyl ether gas via heterogeneous pairwise addition of parahydrogen to ethyl vinyl ether. An approximately 0.1&#8208;liter bolus of hyperpolarized diethyl ether gas was produced in 1 second and injected in excised rabbit lungs. Lung ventilation imaging was performed using sub&#8208;second 2D MRI with up to 2&#215;2&#8197;mm2 in&#8208;plane resolution using a clinical 0.35&#8197;T MRI scanner without any modifications. This feasibility demonstration paves the way for the use of inhalable diethyl ether as a gaseous contrast agent for pulmonary MRI applications using any clinical MRI scanner.

         <title>When is an Imine Directing Group a Transient Imine Directing Group in C&#8722;H Functionalization?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building on the pioneering works using imines to form metallacycle with transition metals, recent developments have realized the potential of using transient directing group (TDG) to direct C&#8722;H functionalization. This article discusses factors defining a transient directing group and strategies to achieve catalytic processes with low directing group loading by highlighting recent advancements in this field.







Abstract
&#8216;Transient&#8217; C&#8722;H functionalization has emerged in recent years to describe the use of a dynamic linkage, often an imine, to direct cyclometallation and subsequent functionalization. As the field continues to grow in popularity, we consider the features that make an imine directing group transient. A transient imine should be i) formed dynamically in&#8197;situ, ii) avoid discrete introduction or cleavage steps, and iii) offer the potential for catalysis in both the directing group and metal. This concept article contrasts transient imines with pioneering early studies of imines as directing groups for the formation of metallacycles and the use of preformed imines in C&#8722;H functionalization. Leading developments in the use of catalytic additives to form transient directing groups (as aldehyde or amine) are covered including selected highlights of the most recent examples of catalytic imine directed C&#8722;H functionalization with transition metals.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Flip via Subtle Electronic Perturbation in Axially Ligated Diiron(III) Porphyrin Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A slight electronic perturbation at the axial ligand of the diheme resulted in a large change in the electronic structures with a spin&#8208;flip from high to intermediate via an admixed state. This is at par with the metalloenzymes, which employ minute perturbations around the periphery of the active sites, leading to spin state transitions.







Abstract
Spin state switching in the metal center is a crucial phenomenon in many enzymatic reactions in biology. The spin state alteration, a critical step in cytochrome P450 catalysis, is driven most likely through a weak perturbation upon substrate binding in the enzyme, which is still not well clarified. In the current work, the spin state transition of iron(III) from high to intermediate via an admixed state is observed upon a subtle electronic perturbation to the sulphonate moieties coordinated axially to a diiron(III)porphyrin dimer. While electron&#8208;donating substituents stabilize the high&#8208;spin state of iron(III), strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing groups stabilize an intermediate&#8208;spin state, whereas the moderate electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of axial ligands resulted in an admixed state. Confirmation of the molecular structures and their spin states have been made utilizing single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis, M&#246;ssbauer, magnetic, EPR, and 1H NMR spectroscopic investigations. The position of the signals of the porphyrin macrocycle in the paramagnetic 1H NMR is found to be very characteristic of the spin state of the iron center in solution. The Curie plot for the pure high&#8208;spin complexes shows the signals&#8242; temperature dependency in line with the Curie law. Conversely, the pure intermediate&#8208;spin state of iron exhibits an anti&#8208;Curie temperature dependence, whereas the admixed&#8208;spin state of iron displays significant curvature of the lines in the Curie plot. An extensive DFT analysis displays a linear dependence between the energy difference between d
 and d
 orbital versus Fe&#8722;Npor distance for the complexes reported here. Furthermore, a strong linear correlation between the Fe&#8722;O distance and the spin density over the oxygen atom, as well as the Fe&#8722;Npor distance for the complexes, has been observed. Thus, a slight electronic perturbation at the axial ligand of the diheme resulted in a large change in the electronic structures with a spin&#8208;flip. This is at par with the metalloenzymes, which employ minute perturbations around the periphery of the active sites, leading to spin state transitions.

         <title>In2Q2: A New Entry of 16&#8208;Membered Tetraazamacrocycle Concatenating Indole and Quinoline Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of 16&#8208;membered macrocycles comprising two indole (In) and two quinoline (Q) units, coined In2Q2, was synthesized. Each unit is diagonally located and concatenated in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail fashion, furnishing a non&#8208;flat saddle&#8208;shaped architecture with C2 symmetry. The In2Q2 derivatives and their Zn2+ complexes were emissive in both solution phase and solid state. While the entire architecture of In2Q2 is similar to that of quinoline tetramer TEtraQuinoline, a couple of contrasting properties were revealed.

         <title>The Role of Base in Reaction Performance of Photochemical Synthesis of Thiazoles: An Integrated Theoretical and Experimental Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work focuses on the prediction of the synthesis of 2&#8208;arylbenzothiazole. Different AI/ML methods are then employed for model training and testing. Feature analysis is conducted through the model interpretation process, enabling further exploration into the reaction mechanisms. We then chose two substrates of distinct structures and verified the predictions through experimental benchwork. This represents a novel reaction with different bases.







Abstract
Artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) is emerging as pivotal in synthetic chemistry, offering revolutionary potential in retrosynthetic analysis, reaction conditions and reaction prediction. We have combined chemical descriptors, primarily based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, with various AI/ML tools such as Multi&#8208;Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Random Forest (RF), to predict the synthesis of 2&#8208;arylbenzothiazole in photoredox reactions. Significantly, our models underscore the critical role of the molecular structure and physicochemical characteristics of the base, especially the total atomic polarizabilities, in the rate&#8208;determining steps involving cyclohexyl and phenethyl moieties of the substrate. Moreover, we validated our findings in articles through experimental studies. It showcases the power of AI/ML and quantum chemistry in shaping the future of organic chemistry.

         <title>Flowmicro in&#8208;Line Analysis&#8208;Driven Design of Reactions Mediated by Unstable Intermediates: Flash Monitoring Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flash monitoring approach led to the direct observation of reactive intermediates in anionic polymerization. By using flow microreactors and in&#8208;line spectroscopic devices, the living ends of anionic polymerization could be analyzed by FTIR within milliseconds to seconds of their generation. Precise control of the reaction temperature and time revealed the stability of these reactive species, enabling an efficient block&#8208;copolymerization. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Nagaki and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303774).

         <title>Magnetic&#8208;Field&#8208;Induced Spin Regulation&#160;in Electrocatalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of a magnetic field to manipulate spin states has emerged as a novel approach to enhance efficiency in electrocatalytic reactions, distinguishing from traditional strategies that focus on tuning activation energy barriers. Currently, this approach is specifically tailored to reactions where spin states change during the catalytic process, such as the oxidation of singlet H2O to triplet O2. In the magnetically enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) procedure, the parallel spin alignment on the ferromagnetic catalyst was induced by the external magnetic field, facilitating the triplet O&#8208;O bonding, which is the rate limiting step in OER. This review centers on recent advancements in harnessing external magnetic fields to enhance OER performance, delving into mechanistic approaches for this magnetic promotion. Additionally, we provide a summary of magnetic field application in other electrocatalytic reactions, including oxygen reduction, methanol oxidation, and CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Eight&#8208;Electron Copper Nanoclusters for Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to distinct physicochemical properties in comparison to gold and silver counterparts, atomically precise copper nanoclusters are attracting embryonic interest in material science. The introduction of copper cluster nanomaterials in more interesting fields is currently urgent and desired. Reported in this work are novel copper nanoclusters of [XCu54Cl12(tBuS)20(NO3)12] (X = S or none, tBuSH = 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;propanethiol), which exhibit high performance in photothermal conversion. The clusters have been prepared in one pot, and characterized by combinatorial techniques including ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy (UV&#8208;vis), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS), and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The molecular structure of the clusters, as revealed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis (SCXRD), shows the concentric three&#8208;shell Russian doll arrangement of X@Cu14@Cl12@Cu40. Interestingly, the [SCu54Cl12(tBuS)20(NO3)12] cluster contains 8 free valence electrons in its structure, making it the first eight&#8208;electron copper nanocluster stabilized by thiolates. More impressively, the clusters possess an effective photothermal conversion (temperature increases by 71oC within ~50 s, &#955;ex = 445 nm, 0.5 W cm&#8208;2) in a wide wavelength range (either blue or near&#8208;infrared). The photothermal conversion can be even driven under irradiation of simulated sunlight (3 sun), endowing the clusters with great potency in solar energy utilizaiton.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>[Gd(HP&#8208;DO3A)] (gadoteridol) as an active compound of ProHance&#174; is a widely employed contrast agent in clinical MRI scans in the last 30 years. Recent concerns about the long&#8208;term retention of gadolinium&#8208;based contrast agents (GBCAs) led to a deeper investigation of the structural features underlying the integrity of the paramagnetic metal complex.

         <title>Endowing Metal&#8208;Organic Coordination Materials with Chiroptical Activity by a Chiral Anion Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, chiral metal&#8208;organic coordination materials have emerged as promising candidates for a wide range of applications in chiroptoelectronics, chiral catalysis, and information encryption, etc. Notably, the chiroptical effect of coordination chromophores makes them appealing for applications such as photodetectors, OLEDs, 3D displays, and bioimaging. The direct synthesis of chiral coordination materials using chiral organic ligands or complexes with metal&#8208;centered chirality is very often tedious and costly. In the case of ionic coordination materials, the combination of chiral anions with cationic, achiral coordination compounds through noncovalent interactions may endow molecular materials with desirable chiroptical properties. The use of such a simple chiral strategy has been proven effective in inducing promising circular dichroism and/or circularly polarized luminescence signals. This concept article mainly delves into the latest advances in exploring the efficacy of such a chiral anion strategy for transforming achiral coordination materials into chromophores with superb photo&#8208; or electro&#8208;chiroptical properties. In particular, ionic small&#8208;molecular metal complexes, metal clusters, coordination supramolecular assemblies, and metal&#8208;organic frameworks containing chiral anions are discussed. A perspective on the future opportunities on the preparation of chiroptical materials with the chiral anion strategy is also presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction and Formic Acid Oxidation by Formal Nickel(I) Complexes of Di&#8208;isopropylphenyl Bis&#8208;iminoacenaphthene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The (dpp&#8211;bian)NiBr2 complex emerged as a robust precatalyst for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide, showcasing notable selectivity in producing methane as the final product. In the course of the catalytic reaction, three&#8211;electron reduced nickel complexes with a formal nickel charge of +1 were identified as intermediates.







Abstract
Processing CO2 into value&#8211;added chemicals and fuels stands as one of the most crucial tasks in addressing the global challenge of the greenhouse effect. In this study, we focused on the complex (dpp&#8211;bian)NiBr2 (where dpp&#8211;bian is di&#8208;isopropylphenyl bis&#8208;iminoacenaphthene) as a precatalyst for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 into CH4 as the sole product. Cyclic voltammetry results indicate that the realization of a catalytically effective pattern requires the three&#8211;electron reduction of (dpp&#8211;bian)NiBr2. The chemically reduced complexes [K(THF)6]+[(dpp&#8211;bian)Ni(COD)]&#8722; and [K(THF)6]+[(dpp&#8211;bian)2Ni]&#8722; were synthesized and structurally characterized. Analyzing the data from the electron paramagnetic resonance study of the complexes in solutions, along with quantum&#8211;chemical calculations, reveals that the spin density is predominantly localized at their metal centers. The superposition of trajectory maps of the electron density gradient vector field 
 and the electrostatic force density field 
 per electron, as well as the atomic charges, discloses that, within the first coordination sphere, the interatomic charge transfer occurs from the metal atom to the ligand atoms and that the complex anions can thus be formally described by the general formulae (dpp&#8211;bian)2&#8722;Ni+(COD) and (dpp&#8211;bian)2&#8722;Ni+. It was also shown that the reduced nickel complexes can be oxidized by formic acid; resulting from this reaction, the two&#8211;electron and two&#8211;proton addition product dpp&#8211;bian&#8211;2H is formed.

         <title>Wireless Light&#8208;emitting Electrode Arrays for the Evaluation of Electrocatalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water splitting has become a sustainable and clean alternative for hydrogen production. Commonly, the efficiency of such reactions is intimately related to the physico&#8208;chemical properties of the catalysts that constitute the electrolyzer. Thus, the development of simple and fast methods to evaluate the electrocatalytic efficiency of an electrolyzer is highly required.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Water splitting has become a sustainable and clean alternative for hydrogen production. Commonly, the efficiency of such reactions is intimately related to the physico-chemical properties of the catalysts that constitute the electrolyzer. Thus, the development of simple and fast methods to evaluate the electrocatalytic efficiency of an electrolyzer is highly required.

         <title>Enabling High Activation of Glucose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate Dehydrogenase Activity Trough Liquid Condensate Formation and Compression</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Droplet formation via liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation is thought to be involved in the regulation of various biological processes, including enzymatic reactions. We investigated a glycolytic enzymatic reaction, the conversion of glucose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate to 6&#8208;phospho&#8208;D&#8208;glucono&#8208;1,3&#8208;lactone with concomitant reduction of NADP+ to NADPH both in the absence and presence of dynamically controlled liquid droplet formation. Here, the nucleotide serves as substrate as well as the scaffold required for the formation of liquid droplets. To further expand the process parameter space, temperature and pressure dependent measurements were performed. Incorporation of the reactants in the liquid droplet phase led to a boost in enzymatic activity, which was most pronounced at medium&#8208;high pressures. The crowded environment of the droplet phase induced a marked increase of the affinity of the enzyme and substrate. An increase in turnover number in the droplet phase at high pressure contributed to a further strong increase in catalytic efficiency. Enzyme systems that are dynamically coupled to liquid condensate formation may be the key to deciphering many biochemical reactions. Expanding the process parameter space by adjusting temperature and pressure conditions can be a means to further increase the efficiency of industrial enzyme utilization and help uncover regulatory mechanisms adopted by extremophiles.</dc:description>

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Aminobenzocoumarins as Fluorescent Probes for Biological Acidity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulation of pH plays an essential role in orchestrating the delicate cellular machinery responsible for life as we know it. Its abnormal values are indicative of aberrant cellular behavior and associated with pathologies including cancer progression or solid tumors. Here, we report a series of bent and linear aminobenzocoumarins decorated with different substituents. We investigate their photophysical properties and demonstrate that the probes display strong pH&#8208;responsive fluorescence &#8220;turn on&#8221; behavior in highly acidic environments, with enhancement up to 300&#8208;fold. In combination with their low cytotoxicity, this behavior enabled their application in bioimaging of acidic lysosomes in live human cells. We believe that these molecules serve as attractive lead structures for future rational design of novel biocompatible fluorescent pH probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Not All Binding Sites Are Equal: Site Determination and Folding State Analysis of Gas&#8208;phase Protein&#8211;Metallodrug Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modern approaches in metallodrug research focus on compounds that bind protein targets rather than DNA. However, the identification of protein targets and binding sites is challenging. Using intact mass spectrometry and proteomics, we investigated the binding of antimetastatic agent RAPTA&#8208;C to the model proteins ubiquitin, cytochrome c, lysozyme and myoglobin. Binding to cytochrome c and lysozyme was negligible. However, ubiquitin bound up to three Ru moieties, two of which were localized at Met1 and His68 as [Ru(cym)], and [Ru(cym)] or [Ru(cym)(PTA)] adducts, respectively. Myoglobin bound up to four [Ru(cym)(PTA)] moieties and five sites were identified at His24, His36, His64, His81/82 and His113. Collision&#8208;induced unfolding (CIU) studies via ion&#8208;mobility mass spectrometry allowed measuring protein folding as a function of collisional activation. CIU of protein&#8211;RAPTA&#8208;C adducts showed binding of [Ru(cym)] to Met1 caused a significant compaction of ubiquitin, likely from N&#8208;terminal S&#8211;Ru&#8211;N chelation, while binding of [Ru(cym)(PTA)] to His residues of ubiquitin or myoglobin induced a smaller effect. Interestingly, the folded state of ubiquitin formed by His&#8208;functionalization was more stable than Met1 metalation. The data suggests that selective metalation of amino acids at different positions on the protein impacts the conformation and potentially the biological activity of anticancer compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Alkalis in Orchestrating Uranyl&#8208;Peroxide Reactivity Leading to Direct Air Capture of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spectator ions have known and emerging roles in aqueous metal&#8208;cation chemistry, respectively directing solubility, speciation, and reactivity. Here, we isolate and structurally characterize the last two metastable members of the alkali uranyl triperoxide series, the Rb+ and Cs+ salts (Cs&#8208;U1 and Rb&#8208;U1). We document their rapid solution polymerization via small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, which is compared to the more stable Li+, Na+ and K+ analogues. To understand the role of the alkalis, we also quantify alkali&#8208;hydroxide promoted peroxide deprotonation and decomposition, which generally exhibits increasing reactivity with increasing alkali size. Cs&#8208;U1, the most unstable of the uranyl triperoxide monomers, undergoes ambient direct air capture of CO2 in the solid&#8208;state, converting to Cs4[UVIO2(CO3)3], evidenced by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. We have attempted to benchmark the evolution of Cs&#8208;U1 to uranyl tricarbonate, which involves a transient, unstable hygroscopic solid that contains predominantly pentavalent uranium, quantified by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction suggests this intermediate state contains a hydrous derivative of CsUVO3, where the parent phase has been computationally predicted, but not yet synthesized.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances Toward Amphidinolides C, F and U: Isolations, Synthetic Studies and Total Syntheses</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphidinolides C, F and U are a sub&#8208;class of polyketides sharing a similar structure, isolated from dinoflagellates or octocoral sponges and exhibiting high cytotoxic activity. This review discloses the progress made in their isolations and structural determinations and the various synthetic approaches and successful attempts leading to their total syntheses.







Abstract
Amphidinolides C, F, and U, including C2&#8208;C4 analogs, are highly cytotoxic marine macrolides, mainly isolated from dinoflagellates of the genus Amphidinium. All these polyketides share a 75&#8201;% or more similar structure, highlighted by a macrolactone ring, at least one trans&#8208;2,5&#8208;substituted&#8208;THF motif and a characteristic polyenic side chain. From their isolation and absolute configurational assignment, the total synthesis of these marine macrolides represented an intense challenge to the organic synthesis community over the last 15&#8197;years, with around 14 research groups engaged in this inspiring task. In the first part of this review, we present the different approaches to the isolation and characterization of these natural products, including the most recent analogs, which may cast doubt on the biogenetic origin of these compounds. The various synthetic approaches to the total synthesis of C, F, and U amphidinolides are presented in a second part, focusing on key reactions and/or innovative strategies.

     alt="Advances Toward Amphidinolides C, F and U: Isolations, Synthetic Studies and Total Syntheses"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amphidinolides C, F and U are a sub-class of polyketides sharing a similar structure, isolated from dinoflagellates or octocoral sponges and exhibiting high cytotoxic activity. This review discloses the progress made in their isolations and structural determinations and the various synthetic approaches and successful attempts leading to their total syntheses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amphidinolides C, F, and U, including C2-C4 analogs, are highly cytotoxic marine macrolides, mainly isolated from dinoflagellates of the genus &lt;i&gt;Amphidinium&lt;/i&gt;. All these polyketides share a 75&#8201;% or more similar structure, highlighted by a macrolactone ring, at least one &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-2,5-substituted-THF motif and a characteristic polyenic side chain. From their isolation and absolute configurational assignment, the total synthesis of these marine macrolides represented an intense challenge to the organic synthesis community over the last 15&#8197;years, with around 14 research groups engaged in this inspiring task. In the first part of this review, we present the different approaches to the isolation and characterization of these natural products, including the most recent analogs, which may cast doubt on the biogenetic origin of these compounds. The various synthetic approaches to the total synthesis of C, F, and U amphidinolides are presented in a second part, focusing on key reactions and/or innovative strategies. The review concludes in a third section summarizing the successful approaches leading to the total synthesis of one of the members of this amphidinolide subfamily.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning the Liquid Crystallinity and Electroluminescence via Sulfonation of S&#8208;Annulated Perylene Tetraester</title>

Tuning of liquid crystallinity, fluorescence and electroluminescence by molecular design.







Abstract
This study presents a comparative analysis of S&#8208;annulated perylene tetraester (PTE&#8208;S) and its sulfone (PTE&#8208;SO2) analogue. This sulfone modification reduced melting point and stabilized a room temperature columnar rectangular (Colr) phase in contrast to its parent PTE&#8208;S which showed a crystalline behaviour at room temperature. This molecular design also leads to red&#8208;shifted absorbance and emission in comparison to PTE&#8208;S, along with a tuning of photoluminescence from sky blue to green, achieving an impressive quantum yield of 85&#8201;%. OLED devices fabricated using PTE&#8208;SO2 as emitter material at concentrations of 0.2, 0.5, and 1&#8197;wt.% in CBP as host material. A maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 2.9&#8201;% was observed with the 0.5&#8197;wt.% PTE&#8208;SO2 in CBP with CIE coordinates of (0.45, 0.35), accompanied by an orange luminance of 848 cd/m2. Notably, a device with a 0.5&#8197;wt% doping concentration of PTE&#8208;S demonstrates an EQE of 3.5&#8201;%, and cyan luminance of 2,598 cd/m2.

         <title>Photocatalytic, Oxidative Cleavage of C&#8722;C Bond in Lignin Models and Native Lignin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic strategy is developed for oxidative cleavage of C&#8722;C bond in lignin models and natural lignin at room temperature. This strategy exhibits several advantages, such as aerobic environment, abundant and inexpensive chloride salts, facile generation of chlorine radical in the presence of organocatalyst, thus representing a significant advancement in the valorization of lignin into highly value&#8208;added aromatic products.







Abstract
It is challenging to realize the selective C&#8722;C bond cleavage of lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkages for production of high&#8208;value aromatic chemicals due to its intrinsic inertness and complex structure. Here we report a light&#8208;driven, chlorine&#8208;radical&#8208;based protocol to realize the oxidative C&#8722;C bond cleavage in various lignin model compounds catalyzed by commercially available TPT and CaCl2, achieving high conversion and good to high product yields at room temperature. Mechanistic studies reveal that the preferential activation of C&#946;&#8722;H bond facilitates the oxidation and C&#8722;C bond cleavage of lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model via chlorine radical. Furthermore, this method is also applicable to the depolymerization of natural lignin extracts, furnishing the aromatic oxygenates from the cleavage of C&#945;&#8722;C&#946; bonds. This study provides experimental foundations to the depolymerization and valorization of lignin into high value&#8208;added aromatic compounds.

         <title>Scope and limitations of using microemulsions for the covalent patterning of graphene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Patterning of graphene (functionalizing some areas while leaving others intact) is challenging, as all the C atoms in the basal plane are identical, but it is also desirable for a variety of applications, like opening a bandgap in the electronic structure of graphene. Several methods have been reported to pattern graphene, but most of them are very technologically intensive. Recently, we reported the use of microemulsions as templates to pattern graphene at the &#181;m scale. This method is very simple and in principle tunable, as emulsions of different droplet size and composition can be prepared easily. Here, we explore in detail the scope of this methodology by applying it to all the combinations of four different emulsions and three different organic reagents, and characterizing the resulting substrates exhaustively through Raman, SEM and AFM. We find that the method is general, works better when the reactive species are outside the micelles, and requires reactive species that involve short reaction times.</dc:description>

         <title>Incorporation of Carboxylate Pendant Arms into 18&#8208;Membered Macrocycles: Effects on [nat/203Pb]Pb(II) Complexation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a detailed investigation on the coordination chemistry of [nat/203Pb]Pb(II) with chelators H4PYTA and H4CHX&#8208;PYTA. These chelators belong to the family of ligands derived from the 18&#8208;membered macrocyclic backbone PYAN and present varying degrees of rigidity due to the presence of either ethyl or cyclohexyl spacers. A complete study of the stable Pb(II) complexes is carried out via NMR, X&#8208;Ray crystallography, stability constant determination and computational studies. While these studies indicated that Pb(II) complexation is achieved, and the thermodynamic stability of the resulting complexes is very high, a certain degree of fluxionality does exist in both cases. Nevertheless, radiolabeling studies were carried out using SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) compatible isotope lead&#8208;203 (203Pb, t1/2 = 51.9 h), and while both chelators complex the radioisotope, the incorporation of carboxylate pendant arms appears to be detrimental towards the stability of the complexes when compared to the previously described amide analogues. Additionally, incorporation of a cyclohexyl spacer does not improve the kinetic inertness of the system.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced strategy has been explored for the synthesis of naphtho[2,1&#8208;d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;amines through ortho&#8208;C&#8208;H sulfuration of 2&#8208;isocyanonaphthalenes with elemental sulfur and amines under external photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions. This three&#8208;component reaction, which utilizes elemental sulfur as the odorless sulfur source, molecular oxygen as the clean oxidant, and visible light as the clean energy source, provides a mild and efficient approach to construct a series of naphtho[2,1&#8208;d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;amines. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicated that visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted photoexcitation of reaction intermediates consisting of thioureas and DBU might be involved in this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ Diazonium Salt Formation and Photochemical Aryl&#8208;Aryl Coupling in Continuous Flow monitored by Inline NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel class of diazonium salts is introduced for the photochemical aryl&#8208;aryl coupling to produce (substituted) biphenyls. As common diazonium tetrafluoroborate salts fail, soluble and safe aryl diazonium trifluoroacetates are applied. In this mild synthesis route no catalysts are required to generate an aryl&#8208;radical by irradiation with UV&#8208;A light (365 nm). This reactive species undergoes direct C&#8208;H arylation at an arene, forming the product in reasonable reaction times. With the implementation of a continuous flow setup in a capillary photoreactor 13 different biphenyl derivatives are successfully synthesized. By integrating an inline 19F&#8208;NMR benchtop spectrometer, samples are reliably quantified as the fluorine&#8208;substituents act as a probe. Here, real&#8208;time NMR spectroscopy is a perfect tool to monitor the continuously operated system, which produces fine chemicals of industrial relevance even in a multigram scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging Halogen Interactions for a Supramolecular Nanotube</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate the formation of supramolecular nanotubes from molecular triangles in a single crystal by balancing the hydrogen bonds and halogen interactions between individual macrocycles. Thereby, we template the supramolecular nanotube growth by intermolecular interactions encoded directly in the macrocycles instead of those provided by the crystallization solvent. Ultimately, we show that replacing bromines for iodines in the macrocycle is necessary to achieve this supramolecular organization by enhancing the strength of the halogen interactions and concomitant reduction of the detrimental hydrogen bonds. We investigated the nature and the interplay of the individual intermolecular interactions by analysis of the experimental single crystal data and quantum chemical calculations. This work enriches the available toolbox of interactions to construct supramolecular nanotubes, and will aid and abet the development of rationally&#8208;designed materials with a long&#8208;range 1D organization.</dc:description>

         <title>Size&#8208;Switchable Ru Nanoaggregates for Enhancing Phototherapy: Hyaluronidase&#8208;Triggered Disassembly to Alleviate Deep Tumor Hypoxia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of multiple bioactivated chemical reactions in&#8197;situ and receptor&#8208;mediated targeting characteristics can alleviate deep tumor tissue hypoxia for improving tumor&#8208;specific phototherapy.







Abstract
Hypoxia is a critical factor for restricting photodynamic therapy (PDT) of tumor, and it becomes increasingly severe with increasing tissue depth. Thus, the relief of deep tumor hypoxia is extremely important to improve the PDT efficacy. Herein, tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive size&#8208;switchable hyaluronic acid&#8208;hybridized Ru nanoaggregates (HA@Ru NAs) were developed via screening reaction temperature to alleviate deep tumor hypoxia for improving the tumor&#8208;specific PDT by the artful integration multiple bioactivated chemical reactions in&#8197;situ and receptor&#8208;mediated targeting (RMT). In this nanosystem, Ru NPs not only enabled HA@Ru NAs to have near infrared (NIR)&#8208;mediated photothermal/photodynamic functions, but also could catalyze endogenous H2O2 to produce O2 in&#8197;situ. More importantly, hyaluronidase (HAase) overexpressed in the TME could trigger disassembly of HA@Ru NAs via the hydrolysis of HA, offering the smart size switch capability from 60 to 15&#8197;nm for enhancing tumor penetration. Moreover, the RMT characteristics of HA ensured that HA@Ru NAs could specially enter CD44&#8208;overexpressed tumor cells, enhancing tumor&#8208;specific precision of phototherapy. Taken together these distinguishing characteristics, smart HA@Ru NAs successfully realized the relief of deep tumor hypoxia to improve the tumor&#8208;specific PDT.

         <title>Electrochemically Driven para&#8208;Selective C(sp2)&#8722;H Alkylation Enabled by Activation of Alkyl Halides without Sacrificial Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemically driven para&#8208;selective C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation of electron&#8208;deficient arenes (aryl esters, aldehydes, nitriles, and ketones) has been achieved with alkyl halides (I, Br, Cl) as a coupling partner. Under mild electrolytic conditions, a variety of alkylated arenes are obtained in one step through the formation of C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) bonds. Notably, the reaction enables the activation of alkyl halides in the absence of sacrificial anodes.







Abstract
With alkyl halides (I, Br, Cl) as a coupling partner, an electrochemically driven strategy for para&#8208;selective C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation of electron&#8208;deficient arenes (aryl esters, aldehydes, nitriles, and ketones) has been achieved to access diverse alkylated arenes in one step. The reaction enables the activation of alkyl halides in the absence of sacrificial anodes, achieving the formation of C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) bonds under mild electrolytic conditions. The utility of this protocol is reflected in high site selectivity, broad substrate scope, and scalable.

         <title>Regulation of Fluorescence and Self&#8208;assembly of a Salicylaldehyde Azine&#8208;Containing Amphiphile by Pillararene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report the regulation of fluorescence and self&#8208;assembly of a salicylaldehyde azine&#8208;containing amphiphile G by a water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene WP5 via host&#8211;guest recognition in water. The fluorescence emission property and self&#8208;assembly behavior of G can be tailored by WP5 or pH conditions. This emission regulatable system was applied in the field of information encryption, rewritable materials, and erasable ink.







Abstract
Regulation of fluorescence and self&#8208;assembly of a salicylaldehyde azine&#8208;containing amphiphile by a water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene via host&#8211;guest recognition in water was realized. The fluorescence and the self&#8208;assembled aggregates of the bola&#8208;type amphiphile G can be tailored by adding different amounts of water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene (WP5). In addition, the emission property and self&#8208;assembly behavior of G and WP5 are responsive to pH conditions. Furthermore, the fluorescence emission property of G and the regulation by WP5 or pH conditions was applied as information encryption material, rewritable paper, and erasable ink. We believe that this fluorescence regulation strategy is promising for the construction of advanced fluorescent organic materials.

         <title>One&#8211;Step Hydrothermal Synthesis of NVO Cathodes with Varied Lattice NH4+ Content: Effect on Structural Evolution and Electrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a one&#8211;step hydrothermal synthesis method to regulate the lattice NH4+ ion content in vanadium oxide materials and discover varied lattice NH4+ content could affect the structural evolution and electrochemical performance of the material, and our work will provide a new route for designing high performance vanadium oxide cathode materials in aqueous zinc ion batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries have been extensively researched due to their distinctive advantages such as low cost and high safety. Vanadium oxides are important cathode materials, however, poor cycle life caused by vanadium dissolution limits their application. Recent studies show that the lattice NH4+ in vanadium oxides can act as a pillar to enhance structural stability and play a crucial role in improving its cycling stability. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of research on the effect of the lattice NH4+ content on structural evolution and electrochemical performance. Herein, we synthesize vanadium oxides with different contents of lattice NH4+ by a one&#8208;step hydrothermal reaction. The vanadium oxides with lattice NH4+ exhibit high initial capacity, as well as good cycling stability and rate performance compared to bare vanadium oxide. Combined with electrochemical analyses, ex&#8208;situ structural characterizations, and in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction tests, we reveal that the lattice NH4+ content plays a positive role in vanadium oxides&#8242; structural stability and cation diffusion kinetics. This work presents a direction for designing high&#8211;performance vanadium cathodes for aqueous zinc ion batteries.

&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion content in vanadium oxide materials and discover varied lattice NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; content could affect the structural evolution and electrochemical performance of the material, and our work will provide a new route for designing high performance vanadium oxide cathode materials in aqueous zinc ion batteries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc ion batteries have been extensively researched due to their distinctive advantages such as low cost and high safety. Vanadium oxides are important cathode materials, however, poor cycle life caused by vanadium dissolution limits their application. Recent studies show that the lattice NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in vanadium oxides can act as a pillar to enhance structural stability and play a crucial role in improving its cycling stability. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of research on the effect of the lattice NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; content on structural evolution and electrochemical performance. Herein, we synthesize vanadium oxides with different contents of lattice NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; by a one-step hydrothermal reaction. The vanadium oxides with lattice NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; exhibit high initial capacity, as well as good cycling stability and rate performance compared to bare vanadium oxide. Combined with electrochemical analyses, ex-situ structural characterizations, and in-situ X-ray diffraction tests, we reveal that the lattice NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; content plays a positive role in vanadium oxides&#8242; structural stability and cation diffusion kinetics. This work presents a direction for designing high&#8211;performance vanadium cathodes for aqueous zinc ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;H Olefination of Imidazo[1,2a] pyridine Carboxamide in Aqueous Ethanol under Oxygen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H olefinations of imidazo[1,2a] pyridine carboxamides were accomplished with greener oxygen in H2O/EtOH robust fashion. Control experimental mechanistic studies supported the formation of organometallic Pd&#8208;intermediates, which are the key elements for the success of the sustainable protocol.







Abstract
The advancement of sustainable chemistry and changes in the economy are strongly intertwined. Reaction time, cost savings, moderate temperatures, and generation of the fewest byproducts are frequently achieved by using catalytic processes. Herein, we report the C&#8722;H olefination of imidazo[1,2a] pyridine carboxamides with various acrylates in the presence of Pd (OAc)2 with O2 as the oxidant in aqueous ethanol rather than using non&#8208;ecofriendly solvents. The C&#8722;H activation features most user&#8208;friendly reaction conditions, excellent yield as well as plenty substrate scope and applicable for C&#8722;H deuteriation of the corresponding heteroarenes with D2O. Experimental mechanistic studies indicate that C&#8722;H activation step succeeded after formation of tetra coordinated square planer Pd&#8208;substrate adduct.

         <title>Dynamics and Coordination of a P2N2 Ligand &#8211; from Twisted Conformation to Chelation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P2N2&#8208;ligands can adopt different conformations among which the twisted form is here characterized unambiguously for the first time using SCXRD. Additionally four respective Mo and W complexes are crystallographically analyzed. The electronic structures of the complexes are compared using spectroscopic data and shown to be dominated by the metal center.







Abstract
Based on their general spacial flexibility, their Lewis and Br&#248;nsted basicity, and ability to mimic second sphere effects the 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;3,7&#8208;diphosphacyclooctane ligand family and their complexes have regained substantial scientific interest. It was now possible to structurally analyze a recently reported member of this family with p&#8208;tolyl and t&#8208;butyl substituents on P and N, respectively, (P2p&#8208;tolN2tBu). Notably, the ligand crystallizes with a &#8216;twisted&#8217; backbone. This compound is the very first of its kind to have been unambiguously characterized with regard to its chemical and molecular structure as being in this conformation. A temperature&#8208;dependent NMR study provides insight into the molecular dynamics of two isomers in solution, which are most likely also both twisted, as judged by the observed limited reactivity. Despite the in principle unfavorable conformation of the free ligand, it was successfully chelated to tungsten and molybdenum centers in mononuclear carbonyl complexes. The ligand, a derivative thereof and four new complexes were comprehensively characterized and analyzed in comparison. This includes single crystal XRD molecular structures of P2p&#8208;tolN2tBu and all four complexes. P2p&#8208;tolN2tBu, regardless of its twisted conformation, is able to coordinate to metal centers given that enough energy (heat) for a conformational change is provided.

         <title>The Resorcinarene Hexameric Capsule as a Supramolecular Photoacid to Trigger Olefin Hydroarylation in Confined Space</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under light irradiation the hexameric resorcinarene capsule increases in acidity of 8.8&#8197;log units with respect to its ground state, becoming the first example of a self&#8208;assembled supramolecular photoacid. The photoacidity of the hexameric capsule was here exploited to boost the olefin hydroarylation reactions in confined space while no reaction occurred in the absence of irradiation and/or capsule. DFT calculations strongly corroborated a mechanism in which the photoacidity of C6* plays a crucial role.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembled resorcinarene capsule C6 shows remarkable photoacidity upon light irradiation, which is here exploited to catalyze olefin hydroarylation reactions in confined space. An experimental pKa* value range of &#8722;3.3&#8211;&#8722;2.8 was estimated for the photo&#8208;excited hexameric capsule C6*, and consequently an increase in acidity of 8.8&#8197;log units was observed with respect to its ground state (pKa=5.5&#8211;6.0). This makes the hexameric capsule the first example of a self&#8208;assembled supramolecular photoacid. The photoacid C6* can catalyze hydroarylation reaction of olefins with aromatic substrates inside its cavity, while no reaction occurred between them in the absence of irradiation and/or capsule. DFT calculations corroborated a mechanism in which the photoacidity of C6* plays a crucial role in the protonation step of the aromatic substrate. A further proton transfer to olefin with a concomitant C&#8722;C bond formation and a final deprotonation step lead to product releasing.

         <title>Regulation of Electronic Structures of the Urchin&#8208;Like NiCoP/CoP Nanocatalysts for Fast Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Urchin&#8208;like NiCoP/CoP heterostructures have been developed through a three&#8208;step hydrothermal&#8208;oxidation&#8208;phosphorization synthesis process. The nano&#8208;architecture and electronic configuration can be regulated by adjusting the original Ni/Co molar ratio and the amount of phosphorus. Consequently, the optimal Ni1Co2P shows excellent performance in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane. Furthermore, by combining infrared spectroscopy and isotope kinetics experiments, a possible reaction mechanism has been proposed.







Abstract
The exploration of stable, efficient, and low&#8208;cost catalysts toward ammonia borane hydrolysis is of vital significance for the practical implementation of this hydrogen production technology. Integrating interface engineering and nano&#8208;architecture engineering is a favorable strategy to elevate catalytic performance, as it can modify the electronic structure and provide sufficient active sites simultaneously. In this work, urchin&#8208;like NiCoP/CoP heterostructures are prepared via a three&#8208;step hydrothermal&#8208;oxidation&#8208;phosphorization synthesis route. It is demonstrated that the original Ni/Co molar ratio and the amount of phosphorus are crucial for adjusting the morphology, enhancing the exposed surface area, facilitating charge transfer, and modulating the adsorption and activation of H2O molecules. Consequently, the optimal Ni1Co2P heterostructure displays remarkable catalytic properties in the hydrolysis of ammonia borane with a turnover frequency (TOF) value of 30.3&#8197;molH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;min&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;molmetal&#8722;1, a low apparent activation energy of 25.89&#8197;kJ&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1, and good stability. Furthermore, by combining infrared spectroscopy and isotope kinetics experiments, a possible mechanism for the hydrolysis of ammonia borane was proposed.

         <title>Stabilisation of the [SiH6]2&#8722; Anion within a Supramolecular Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bring solid state chemistry into solution. Using a supramolecular assembly to mimic the coordination environment of [SiH6]2&#8722; in the solid&#8208;state, a molecular [SiH6]2&#8722; complex that is stable in solution is reported.







Abstract
The hypercoordinate [SiH6]2&#8722; anion is not stable in solution. Here, we report the room temperature, solution stable molecular [SiH6]2&#8722; complex, [{KCa(NON)(OEt2)}2][SiH6] (NON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene)), where the [SiH6]2&#8722; anion is stabilised within a supramolecular assembly that mimics the solid&#8208;state environment of the anion in the lattice of K2SiH6. Solution&#8208;state reactivity of the complex towards carbon monoxide, benzaldehyde, azobenzene and acetonitrile is reported, yielding a range of reduction and C&#8722;C coupled products.

         <title>Azulene&#8208;Containing Bis(squaraine) Dyes: Design, Synthesis and Aggregation Behaviors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The relationship among chemical structure, physicochemical property and aggregation behavior of organic functional material is an important research topic. Here, we designed and synthesized three bis(squaraine) dyes BSQ1, BSQ2 and BSQ3 through the combination of two kinds of unsymmetrical azulenyl squaraine monomers. Their physicochemical properties were investigated in both molecular and aggregate states. Generally, BSQ1 displayed different assembly behavior from BSQ2 and BSQ3. Upon fabrication into nanoparticles, BSQ1 tend to form J&#8208;aggregates while BSQ2 and BSQ3 tend to form H&#8208;aggregates in aqueous medium. When in the form of thin films, three bis(squaraine) dyes all adopted J&#8208;aggregation packing modes while only BSQ1 presented the most significant rearrangement of aggregate structures as well as the improvement in the carrier mobilities upon thermal annealing. Our research highlights the discrepancy of aggregation behaviors originating from the molecular structure and surrounding circumstances, providing guidance for the molecular design and functional applications of squaraines.</dc:description>

         <title>Cellular Uptake of Cell&#8208;Penetrating Peptides Activated by Amphiphilic p&#8208;Sulfonatocalix[4]arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of a series of amphiphilic p&#8208;sulfonatocalix[4]arenes with varying alkyl chain lengths (CX4&#8208;Cn) and their application as efficient counterion activators for membrane transport of cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs). The enhanced membrane activity is confirmed with the carboxyfluorescein (CF) assay in vesicles and by the direct cytosolic delivery of CPPs into CHO&#8208;K1, HCT 116, and KTC&#8208;1 cells enabling excellent cellular uptake of the CPPs into two cancer cell lines. Intracellular delivery was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy after CPP entry into live cells mediated by CX4&#8208;Cn, which was also quantified after cell lysis by fluorescence spectroscopy. The results present the first systematic exploration of structure&#8208;activity relationships for calixarene&#8208;based counterion activators and show that CX4&#8208;Cn are exceptionally effective in cellular delivery of CPPs. The dodecyl derivative, CX4&#8208;C12, serves as best activator. A first mechanistic insight is provided by efficient CPP uptake at 4 &#176;C and in the presence of the endocytosis inhibitor dynasore, which indicates a direct translocation of the CPP&#8208;counterion complexes into the cytosol and highlights the potential benefits of CX4&#8208;Cn for efficient and direct translocation of CPPs and CPP&#8208;conjugated cargo molecules into the cytosol of live cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimal oriented external electric elds to trigger a barrierless oxaphosphetane ring opening step of the Wittig reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Wittig reaction is one of the most important processes
in organic chemistry for the asymmetric synthesis of olefinic compounds.
In view of the increasingly acknowledged potentiality of the
electric fields in promoting reactions, here we will consider
the effect of the oriented external electric&#8194;field (OEEF) on
the second step of Wittig reaction (i.e. the ring opening
oxaphosphetane) in a model system for non&#8208;stabilized
ylides. In particular, we have determined the optimal direction
and strength of the electric &#8194;field that should be applied
to annihilate the reaction barrier of the ring opening
through the polarizable molecular electric dipole (PMED)
model that we have recently developed. We conclude that
the application of the optimal external electric &#8194;field for the
oxaphosphetane ring opening favours a Bestmann&#8208;like mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of the cirratiomycin biosynthesis gene cluster in Streptomyces cirratus: elucidation of the biosynthetic pathways for 2,3&#8208;diaminobutyric acid and hydroxymethylserine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cirratiomycin, a heptapeptide with antibacterial activity, was isolated and characterized in 1981; however, its biosynthetic pathway has not been elucidated. It contains several interesting nonproteinogenic amino acids, such as (2S,3S)&#8208;2,3&#8208;diaminobutyric acid ((2S,3S)&#8208;DABA) and &#945;&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)serine, as building blocks. Here, we report the identification of a cirratiomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces cirratus. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that several Streptomyces viridifaciens and Kitasatospora aureofaciens strains also have this cluster. One S. viridifaciens strain was confirmed to produce cirratiomycin. The biosynthetic gene cluster was shown to be responsible for cirratiomycin biosynthesis in S. cirratus in a gene inactivation experiment using CRISPR&#8208;cBEST. Interestingly, this cluster encodes a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) composed of 12 proteins, including those with an unusual domain organization: a stand&#8208;alone adenylation domain, two stand&#8208;alone condensation domains, two type II thioesterases, and two NRPS modules that have no adenylation domain. Using heterologous expression and in vitro analysis of recombinant enzymes, we revealed the biosynthetic pathway of (2S,3S)&#8208;DABA: (2S,3S)&#8208;DABA is synthesized from l&#8208;threonine by four enzymes, CirR, CirS, CirQ, and CirB. In addition, CirH, a glycine/serine hydroxymethyltransferase homolog, was shown to synthesize &#945;&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)serine from d&#8208;serine in vitro. These findings broaden our knowledge of nonproteinogenic amino acid biosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Responsive Gradient Structured Actuator via Photopolymerization&#8208;Induced Diffusion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive materials have recently gained significant attention in the field of soft robotics, sensors, and biomimetic devices. The most facile way for the fabrication of such materials remains to endow bilayer structures which are fabricated with the combination of active and passive layers. Although, easily fabricated, these structures suffer from the generation of stress points between connection areas. In this work we develop a method to create a thin film with controlled cross&#8208;link variation across its thickness. The cross&#8208;link gradient is achieved through polymerization induced diffusion of dithiol molecules in thiol&#8208;ene network. As a result, the film exhibits bending deformation upon illumination with light or exposure to a chemical solvent, thereby demonstrating dual responsiveness. Light actuation of the film achieved via photothermal effects due to the incorporation of dye into the system which can absorb UV light and heat the network. While solvent induced actuation is due to anisotropic swelling. Furthermore, the straightforward fabrication procedure allowed for the creation of more complex deformations by patterning the film using a photomask during photopolymerization.</dc:description>

Furthermore, the straightforward fabrication procedure allowed for the creation of more complex deformations by patterning the film using a photomask during photopolymerization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inducing &#945;&#8208;helicity in peptides by silver coordination to cysteine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Short peptide sequences consisting of two cysteine residues separated by three other amino acids display complete change from random coil to &#945;&#8208;helical secondary structure in response to addition of Ag+ ions. The folded CXXXC/Ag+ complex involves formation of multinuclear Ag+ species and is stable in a wide pH range from below 3 to above 8. The complex is stable through reversed&#8208;phase HPLC separation as well as towards a physiological level of chloride ions, based on far&#8208;UV circular dichroism spectroscopy. In electrospray MS under acidic conditions a peptide dimer with four Ag+ ions bound was observed, and modelling based on potentiometric experiments supported this to be the dominating complex. The complex was demonstrated to work as a N&#8208;terminal nucleation site for inducing &#945;&#8208;helicity into longer peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Discharge Processes of Li&#8722;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8722;CO2 batteries correspond to renewable energy storage in a cost&#8208;effective, eco&#8208;friendly CO2 fixation manner. However, an inadequate understanding of their reaction mechanism severely impedes their development. Here we outline recent mechanistic advances in the discharge processes of Li&#8722;CO2 batteries, especially from the theoretical aspect. We first highlight the vital factors affecting the formation of discharge intermediates and a surface lithiation mechanism that may dominate the catalysts with weak CO2 adsorption. Then, we discuss the modeling of the chemical potential of Li+ + e&#8722;, which is crucial for the evaluation of the theoretical limiting voltage. Finally, we describe challenges and future directions to facilitate the understanding of Li&#8722;CO2 electrochemistry. This concept article would inspire more experimental and theoretical studies to advance the development of Li&#8722;CO2 electrochemical technology.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acenes and Naphthalene Diimides (NDIs) stand as distinguished classes of organic compounds, each possessing unique and intriguing properties that have garnered significant attention across various scientific disciplines. Acenes, characterized by linearly fused aromatic rings, have captivated researchers due to their diverse electronic structures and promising applications in materials science. On the other hand, NDIs, known for their distinctive electron&#8208;accepting properties, exhibit remarkable versatility in fields ranging from organic electronics, supramolecular to spin chemistry. In this review, we navigate through the fascinating realms of both acenes and NDIs before converging our focus on the highly diverse and distinctive subgroup of NDI&#8208;annulated heterocyclic acenes. This potentially important subgroup, has emerged as a subject of intense investigation, encapsulating their fascinating synthesis, optical and electrochemical characteristics, and multifaceted applications that span the realms of chemistry, physics, and biology. Through the exploration of their synthetic strategies, unique properties, and diverse applications, this review aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of the pivotal role played by NDI&#8208;based heterocyclic acenes in contemporary multidisciplinary research and technological innovation.</dc:description>

         <title>Mesogenic Ordering&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly of Liquid Crystalline Block Copolymers in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the development of nanotechnology, the preparation of polymeric nanoparticles with nicely defined structures has been well&#8208;developed, and the functionalization and subsequent applications of the resultant nanostructures are becoming increasingly important. Particularly, by introducing mesogenic ordering as the driving force for the solution&#8208;state self&#8208;assembly of liquid crystalline (LC) block copolymers (BCPs), micellar nanostructures with different morphologies, especially anisotropic morphologies, can be easily prepared. This review summarizes the recent progress in the solution&#8208;state self&#8208;assembly of LC BCPs and is mostly focused on four main related aspects, including an in&#8208;depth understanding of the mesogenic ordering&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, precise self&#8208;assembly methods, utilization of these methods to fabricate hierarchical structures, and the potential applications of these well&#8208;defined nanostructures. We hope not only to make a systematic summary of previous studies but also to provide some useful thinking for the future development of this field.</dc:description>

         <title>A Healable Quasi&#8208;Solid Polymer Electrolyte with Balanced Toughness and Ionic Conductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have garnered extensive attention as potential alternatives to traditional liquid electrolytes, primarily due to their prowess in curbing lithium dendrite formation and preventing electrolyte leaks. The quest for SPEs that are both mechanically robust and exhibit superior ionic conductivity has been vigorous. However, achieving a harmonious balance between these two attributes remains a significant challenge. In this study, we introduce a novel quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte, ingeniously crafted from a poly(urethane&#8208;urea) network, enriched with lithium salts and plasticizers. This innovative composition not only boasts remarkable toughness but also ensures commendable ionic conductivity. Our post&#8208;gelation method yields gel polymer electrolytes that undergo rigorous evaluation, leading to an optimized version that stands out with its exceptional room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity (2.94 &#215; 10&#8208;4 S cm&#8208;1) and outstanding toughness (11.9 MJ m&#8208;3). Moreover, it demonstrates a broad electrochemical window (4.73 V), remarkable stability across a 600&#8208;hour cycle test, a high capacity retention exceeding 80% after 100 cycles at 0.2 C, and a noteworthy self&#8208;healing capability. This quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte emerges as a promising contender to replace current liquid electrolyte solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>Quest for Double M&#246;bius Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Neutral four&#8208;membered rings with 4n electrons are generally H&#252;ckel antiaromatic. On the other hand, 4n electron system can also be M&#246;bius aromatic, although identification has escaped so far. A recent study of double M&#246;bius aromaticity has been put forwarded in the D2h symmetric singlet ground state of four member Pa2B2 ring. Although interesting, but the synthesis possesses a significant challenge as Pa is rare, highly radioactive and toxic. Herein, a synthetically viable four membered Rh2B2 cluster is proposed which contains double M&#246;bius aromaticity. Interestingly, the three membered RhB2&#8208; cluster also possess M&#246;bius aromaticity and is the smallest ring to show such phenomenon.</dc:description>

         <title>Cellular Applications of DNP Solid&#8208;State NMR &#8211;State of the Art and a Look to the Future</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sensitivity enhanced dynamic nuclear polarization solid&#8208;state NMR is emerging as a powerful technique for probing the structural properties of conformationally homogenous and heterogenous biomolecular species irrespective of size at atomic resolution within native environments. Herein we detail advancements that have made acquiring such data, specifically within the confines of intact bacterial and eukaryotic cell a reality, and further discuss the type of structural information that can be presently garnered by the technique&#8217;s exploitation. Subsequently, we discuss bottlenecks that have thus far curbed cellular DNP&#8208;ssNMR&#8217;s broad adoption, namely a lack of sensitivity and spectral resolution, and explore possible solutions ranging from utilization of new pulse sequences, design of better performing polarizing agents, and application of additional biochemical/ cell biological methodologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Fe Doping Profile on Current Collapse in GaN&#8208;based RF HEMTs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using computer&#8208;aided design (TCAD) simulation, the impact of the Fe doping profile, including concentration, decay rate, and depth of the doping region on current&#8208;collapse magnitude (&#8710;CC) in 0.5&#8208;&#956;m gated GaN&#8208;based high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) is systematically investigated. Accurate simulation models are established and developed to facilitate the fabrication of electronics. It is elucidated that the intricate interplay between trapping and de&#8208;trapping of Fe&#8208;related traps at the gate&#8208;drain edge is responsible for current collapse. The concentration and decay rate of the doping region have a more significant impact on current collapse than the depth. Increased trap state density near two&#8208;dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel caused by deep&#8208;level acceptors would boost &#8710;CC. However, a minor dynamic reduction in 2DEG density (nT) induces a relatively small &#8710;CC. By adjusting the concentration, decay rate, and depth of the doping region, &#8710;CC of GaN&#8208;based Radio Frequency (RF) HEMTs can be reduced by approximately 50.3%.The optimized distribution of Fe doping discussed in this work helps to prepare GaN&#8208;based RF HEMTs with a limited current collapse effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Socialane, a Nonaprenyl Terpene Hydrocarbon Surface Lipid from the Collembola Hypogastrura socialis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Springtails use unique compounds for their outermost epicuticular wax layer, often of terpenoid origin. We report here the structure and synthesis of socialane, the major cuticular constituent of the Collembola Hypogastrura socialis. Socialane is also the first regular nonaprenyl terpene with a cyclic head group. The saturated side chain has seven stereogenic centers, making the determination of the configuration difficult. We describe here the identification of socialane and a synthetic approach using the building blocks farnesol and phytol, enantioselective hydrogenation, and a&#8208;alkylation of sulfones for the synthesis of various stereoisomers. NMR experiments showed the presence of an anti&#8208;configuration of the methyl groups closest to the benzene ring and that the other methyl groups of the polyprenyl side&#8208;chain are not uniformly configured. Furthermore, socialane is structurally different from [6+2]&#8208;terpene viaticene of the closely related H. viatica, showing species specificity of the epicuticular lipids of this genus and hinting at a possible role of surface lipids in the communication of these gregarious arthropods.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimodal use of chiral &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylalanine in Aib Foldamers: study of the position impact towards the helical screw&#8208;sense preference</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligomers of the achiral &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) adopt a 310 helical conformation in which the screw&#8208;sense preference can be controlled by a single chiral residue. The use of the fluorinated residue &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylalanine (&#945;&#8208;TfmAla) revealed a unique way to both induce and measure the screw&#8208;sense preference of such oligomers acting as 19F NMR probe. This work proposes a systematic study of the effect of this fluorinated chiral inducer on the helical screw&#8208;sense preference of poly&#8208;Aib oligomers. The impact of the position of the fluorinated residue into pentamers (N&#8208;terminal, central or C&#8208;terminal) as well as the nature of the C&#8208;terminal capping of the peptides was thoroughly studied in light of complete structural analysis. A deeper understanding of the fluorine effect was achieved confirming the unique ability of &#945;&#8208;TfmAla as a helical screw&#8208;sense controller.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An effective, GFP&#8208;inspired fluorescent Zn2+ sensor is developed for two&#8208;photon microscopy and related biological application that featured an 8&#8208;methoxyquinoline moiety. Excellent photophysical characteristics including a 37&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement with excitation and emission maxima at 440 nm and 505&#160;nm, respectively, as well as a high two&#8208;photon cross&#8208;section of 73 GM at 880 nm are reported. Based on the experimental data, the relationship between the structure and properties was elucidated and explained backed up by DFT calculations, particularly to the observed PeT phenomenon for the turn&#8208;on process. Biological validation and detailed experimental and theoretical characterization of the free and the zinc&#8208;bound compounds are presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of polymer side chain size and backbone length on the self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular polymer bottlebrushes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen bonds are a versatile tool for creating fibrous, bottlebrush&#8208;like assemblies of polymeric building blocks. However, a delicate balance of forces exists between the steric repulsion of the polymer chains and these directed supramolecular forces. In this work we have systematically investigated the influence of structural parameters of the attached polymers on the assembly behaviour of benzene trisurea (BTU) and benzene tris(phenylalanine) (BTP) conjugates in water. Polymers with increasing main chain lengths and different side chain sizes were prepared by reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (RAFT) polymerization of hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA), tri(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (TEGA) and oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (OEGA). The resulting structures were analyzed using small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Both BTU and BTP formed fibres with PHEA attached, but a transition to spherical morphologies was observed at degrees of polymerisation (DP) of 70 and above. Overall, the main chain length appeared to be a dominating factor in inducing morphology transitions. Increasing the side chain size generally had a similar effect but mainly impeded any aggregation as is the case of POEGA. Interestingly, BTP conjugates still formed fibres, suggesting that the stronger intermolecular interactions can compensate partially for the steric repulsion.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Ionic Ir(III) Cyclometalated Complexes as Photocatalysts for Light Assisted ATRP of MMA. A Combined Experimental and Mechanistic Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new family of ionic Ir(III) cyclometalated complexes with general formula [Ir(C^N)2(N^N)][Br], was designed and prepared to be assessed as photocalysts for the visible light assisted ATRP polymerization of MMA. To this purpose, our design strategy involved both: i) the decoration of the cyclometalating (C^N) and the ancillary (N^N) ligands with various electron withdrawing and/or electron donor substituents and, ii) the use of Br&#8208; as the counter anion for these cationic Ir(III) species. After an extensive screening in which the [Ir(C^N)2(N^N)][Br]&#8208;type compounds were compared to the model neutral complex fac&#8208;[Ir(ppy)3], the &#8220;fully&#8221; amino&#8208;substituted ion pairs abbreviated as [10][Br] and [11][Br], exhibited the best photocatalytic performances under irradiation with CFL lamps. It is worth noting that the outcomes of transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) experiments combined with theoretical DFT calculations, allowed to corroborate the role played by the Ir(III) complexes in the mechanism responsible the photoATRP process, and suggested the rationalization of the different performances that were highlighted by our Ir(III) catalyst in the visible light assisted photopolymerization of MMA.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks as Nano&#8208;Reservoir for Room Temperature RNA Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emerging role of Ribonucleic acids (RNAs) as therapeutics is alluring. However, RNAs are extremely labile under ambient conditions and typically need to be stored in cryogenic conditions (&#8208;20 &#7506;C to &#8208;80 &#7506;C). Hence, storage, stabilization, and transportation of RNA under ambient conditions have been an arduous task and remain an unsolved problem. In this work, a guanidinium&#8208;based ionic covalent organic framework (COF), TTGCl with nanotubular morphology, was synthesized and used as nano&#8208;reservoirs for room&#8208;temperature storage of RNA. To understand the role of the nanotubular morphology and chemical nature of TTGCl in stabilizing the RNA structure and for comparison purposes, a neutral COF, TMT&#8208;TT, is synthesized and studied. Further, density functional theory (DFT) studies confirmed non&#8208;covalent interaction between the COFs and the RNA nucleobases, facilitating reversible storage of RNA. RNA loaded in COFs was found to be resistant to enzymatic degradation when treated with RNase. Gel electrophoresis and sequencing confirmed the structural integrity of the recovered RNAs and their further processibility.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Templated Assembly of D5h&#8208;Symmetric Pd5L10&#160;Rings by Precise Ligand Angle Adjustment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a series of Pd(II)nL2n coordination rings for which nuclearity is controlled by the binding angle of the corresponding bis&#8208;monodentate bridging ligands. Judicious choice of the angle within a family of rather rigid ligands allowed for the first&#8208;time to synthesize a homoleptic five&#8208;membered Pd5L10 ring that does not require any template to form. We demonstrate that control over the ring size is maintained both in the solid&#8208;, solution&#8208;, and gas&#8208;phase. Two X&#8208;ray structures of fivemembered rings from ligands with ideal angles (yielding a perfect pentagonal ring) vs. suboptimal angles (resulting in a highly distorted structure) illustrate the importance of the correct ligand geometry. A mathematical model for estimating the expected ring size based on the ligand angle was derived and DFT computations show that ring&#8208;strain is the major factor determining the assembly outcome.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Stable Self&#8208;Regenerating Organic Multi&#8208;Redox Systems derived from Bicyclic (Alkyl)(amino)carbenes (BICAACs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An extended class of organic multi&#8208;redox systems was derived from bicyclic(alkyl)amino carbenes (BICAACs).&#160;The highly&#8208;conjugated system undergoes a total of 4 redox events spanning a 1.8 V redox range.&#160;These organic compounds exhibited four different stable redox states (dication, radical cation, neutral and radical anion), and all of them were characterized either by single crystal X&#8208;ray study and/or various spectroscopic studies.&#160;Three of the four redox states are stable to air and moisture.&#160;The availability of stable multiple redox states demonstrated promise towards their efficacy in the symmetric H&#8208;cell charge/discharge cycling. Among various redox states, the dication/neutral state works efficiently and continuously for 1500 cycles in 2e&#8208;&#160;charge/discharge process outside glovebox in commercially available DMF with minimum capacity loss (retaining nearly 90% Coulombic efficiency). Surprisingly, the efficiency of the redox cycle was retained even if the system was exposed to air for 30 days when it slowly regenerated to the initial deep blue radical cation, and it exhibited another 100 charge/discharge cycles with a minimal capacity loss.&#160;Such a stable H&#8208;cell cycling ability is not well known among organic molecule&#8208;based systems.</dc:description>
