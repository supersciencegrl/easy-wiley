         <title>Domino Dehydrative &#960;&#8208;Extension: A Facile Path to Extended Perylenes and Terrylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective activation of identical functional groups is one of the most challenging tasks in the realm of organic chemistry. Dehydrative &#960;&#8208;extensions (DPEX) is a reaction that distinguishes &#8220;active&#8221; and &#8220;dormant&#8221; aldehyde groups based on their position and ability to participate in intramolecular reactions. This unusual feature allows the method to be used for programmed domino folding, in which aldehyde groups are activated sequentially in accordance with the program inbuilt into the precursor's structure. More information can be found in the Communication by K. Amsharov et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103098).

         <title>Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Haloalkynylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal catalysts can be used to react haloacetylenes with unsaturated compounds such as arynes, alkenes and alkynes, whereby the alkynyl unit and the halogen atom are usually added to adjacent positions. Cu, Pd and Au metal complexes have so far proved to be particularly suitable catalysts. The choice of catalyst system decisively determines the regio&#8208; and stereochemistry of the resulting halogenated product.







Abstract
Metal catalysis has revolutionized synthetic chemistry, leading to entirely new, very efficient transformations, which enable access to complex functionalized molecules. One such new transformation method is the haloalkynylation reaction, in which both a halogen atom and an alkynyl unit are transferred to an unsaturated carbon&#8208;carbon bond. This minireview summarizes the development of metal&#8208;catalyzed haloalkynylation reactions since their beginning about a decade ago. So far, arynes, alkenes and alkynes have been used as unsaturated systems and the reactivities of these systems are summarized in individual chapters of the minireview. Especially, the last few years have witnessed a rapid development due to gold&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Here, we discuss how the choice of the catalytic system influences the regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity of the addition.

         <title>Rhodium Indenyl NHC and Fluorenyl&#8208;Tethered NHC Half&#8208;Sandwich Complexes: Synthesis, Structures and Applications in the Catalytic C&#8722;H Borylation of Arenes and Alkanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indenyl rhodium NHC complexes with labile alkene ligands (ethene and cyclooctene) have been synthesized and shown to be better catalysts than the related fluorenyl&#8208;tethered NHC rhodium complexes for the C&#8722;H activation and borylation of arenes and alkanes.







Abstract
Indenyl (Ind) rhodium N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes [Rh(&#951;5&#8208;Ind)(NHC)(L)] were synthesised for 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydroimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (SIPr) with L=C2H4 (1), CO (2&#8201;a) and cyclooctene (COE; 3), for 1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydroimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (SIMes) with L=CO (2&#8201;b) and COE (4), and 1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IMes) with L=CO (2&#8201;c) and COE (5). Reaction of SIPr with [Rh(Cp*)(C2H4)2] did not give the desired SIPr complex, thus demonstrating the &#8220;indenyl effect&#8221; in the synthesis of 1. Oxidative addition of HSi(OEt)3 to 3 proceeded under mild conditions to give the Rh silyl hydride complex [Rh(Ind){Si(OEt)3}(H)(SIPr)] (6) with loss of COE. Tethered&#8208;fluorenyl NHC rhodium complexes [Rh{(&#951;5&#8208;C13H8)C2H4N(C)C2HxNR}(L)] (x=4, R=Dipp, L=C2H4: 11; L=COE: 12; L=CO: 13; R=Mes, L=COE: 14; L=CO: 15; x=2, R=Me, L=COE: 16; L=CO: 17) were synthesised in low yields (5&#8211;31&#8201;%) in comparison to good yields for the monodentate complexes (49&#8211;79&#8201;%). Compounds 3 and 1, which contain labile alkene ligands, were successful catalysts for the catalytic borylation of benzene with B2pin2 (Bpin=pinacolboronate, 97 and 93&#8201;% PhBpin respectively with 5&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst, 24&#8197;h, 80&#8201;&#176;C), with SIPr giving a more active catalyst than SIMes or IMes. Fluorenyl&#8208;tethered NHC complexes were much less active as borylation catalysts, and the carbonyl complexes were inactive. The borylation of toluene, biphenyl, anisole and diphenyl ether proceeded to give meta substitutions as the major product, with smaller amounts of para substitution and almost no ortho product. The borylation of octane and decane with B2pin2 at 120 and 140&#8201;&#176;C, respectively, was monitored by 11B NMR spectroscopy, which showed high conversions into octyl and decylBpin over 4&#8211;7&#8197;days, thus demonstrating catalysed sp3 C&#8722;H borylation with new piano stool rhodium indenyl complexes. Irradiation of the monodentate complexes with 400 or 420&#8197;nm light confirmed the ready dissociation of C2H4 and COE ligands, whereas CO complexes were inert. Evidence for C&#8722;H bond activation in the alkyl groups of the NHC ligands was obtained.

         <title>Strong Ligand Stabilization Based on &#960;&#8208;Extension in a Series of Ruthenium Terpyridine Water Oxidation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water oxidation catalysis on a series of ruthenium(II) terpyridine complexes shows a correlation between catalytic performance and the extension of their &#960; bidentate ligand. Substitution of the Cl&#8722; ligand by H2O reveals increased stability of the Ru&#8722;Cl bond upon increasing the &#960;&#8208;system. Computational studies demonstrated how the greater stability of the Cl&#8722; ligand negatively influences O2 evolution despite the reaction energy barriers of water oxidation being identical among all complexes. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Gr&#228;fe, L. Gonz&#225;lez, S. Rau, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102905).

         <title>Reactivity of the Bicyclic Amido&#8208;Substituted Silicon (I) Ring Compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4 with FLP&#8208;Type Character</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unsaturated bicyclo[1.1.0]tetrasilatetraamide Si4{N(Mes)SiMe3}4 shown in the upper right corner has two threefold&#8208;coordinated silicon atoms that show zwitterionic character. This gives the molecule intramolecular FLP&#8208;type character. Different acids such as AlBr3, BH3, H+ and the base NHCMe4 can simply coordinate to the threefold&#8208;coordinated silicon atoms. These reagents &#8220;click&#8221; in place just like magnetic sticks and steel balls from a molecular construction kit do. More information can be found in the Full Paper by F. Lips et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103101).

         <title>Total Synthesis of Pulvomycin D</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A synthetic route to the pulvomycin class of natural products is presented, which culminated in the first synthesis of a pulvomycin, pulvomycin D. Key elements of the strategy include a pivotal aldol reaction which led to bond formation between the C24&#8208;C40 and the C8&#8208;C23 fragment. The remaining C1&#8208;C7 fragment was attached by a Yamaguchi esterification completing the assembly of the 40 carbon atoms within the main skeleton. Ring closure to the 22&#8208;membered lactone ring was achieved in the final stages of the synthesis by a Heck reaction. The completion of the synthesis required the removal of six silyl protecting groups in combination with olefin formation at C26&#8208;C27 by a Peterson elimination.</dc:description>

         <title>Crown Ether Host&#8208;Guest Molecular Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, molecular ferroelectrics have received great attention due to their lightweight, mechanical flexibility, easy preparation and excellent ferroelectric properties. Among them, crown ether&#8208;based molecular ferroelectrics, which are typically composed of the host crown ethers, the guest cations anchored in the crown ethers, and the counterions, are of great interest because of the host&#8208;guest structure. Such a structure allows the components to occur order&#8208;disorder transition easily, which is beneficial for inducing ferroelectric phase transition. Herein, we summarized the research progress of crown ether host&#8208;guest molecular ferroelectrics, focusing on their crystal structure, phase transition, ferroelectric&#8208;related properties. In view of the small spontaneous polarization and uniaxial nature, we outlook the chemical design strategies for obtaining high&#8208;performance crown ether&#8208;based molecular ferroelectrics. This minireview will be of guiding significance for the future exploration of crown ether host&#8208;guest molecular ferroelectrics.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;heme&#8208;iron&#8208;mediated selective halogenation of unactivated carbon&#8208;hydrogen bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidation of the iron(II) precursor [(L  1  )Fe  II  Cl  2  ] with soluble iodosylbenzene  s  PhIO, where L  1  is a tetradentate bispidine, leads to the extremely reactive ferryl oxidant [(L  1  )(Cl)Fe  IV  =O]  +  with a  cis  disposition of the chlorido and oxido coligands as observed in nonheme halogenase enzymes. Experimental data indicate that, with cyclohexane as substrate, there is selective formation of chlorocyclohexane, where the halogenation is initiated by C&#8208;H abstraction and the result of a rebound of the ensuing radical to an iron&#8208;bound Cl  &#8208;  . The time&#8208;resolved formation of the halogenation product indicates that this primarily results from  s  PhIO oxidation of an initially formed oxido&#8208;bridged diiron(III) resting state. The high yield of up to over 70% (stoichiometric reaction) as well as the differing reactivities of free Fe  2+  and Fe  3+  in comparison with [(L  1  )Fe  II  Cl  2  ] indicate a high complex stability of the bispidine&#8208;iron complexes. A DFT analysis shows that, due to a large driving force and small triplet&#8208;quintet gap, in comparison to other small molecule halogenase models [(L  1  )(Cl)Fe  IV  =O]  +  is the most reactive, that the Fe  III  / radical rebound intermediate has a relatively long lifetime, supported by experimentally observed cage escape, and that this intermediate has, as observed experimentally, a lower energy barrier to the halogenation than the hydroxylation product, and this is shown to primarily be due to steric effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Steric Repulsion Induced Conformational Switch in Supramolecular Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by the rigidified architecture of &#8216;picket&#8208;fence&#8217; systems, we propose a strategy utilizing strain in already peripherally overcrowded structures to impose intramolecular tension for selective atropisomeric conversion. Employing this approach, tunable shape&#8208;persistent porphyrin conformations were acquired exhibiting distinctive supramolecular nanostructures based on the orientation of the peripheral groups. The developed molecular strain engineering methodologies have allowed the introduction of the pivalic units creating a highly strained molecular skeleton. Changes in absorption spectrum indicated the presence of severe steric repulsions which were confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. To release the steric strain introduced by the peripheral units, thermal equilibration strategies were used to selectively convert the most abundant atropisomer to the desirable minor one.</dc:description>

         <title>Tris(tetramethylguanidinyl)phosphine: The simplest non&#8208;ionic phosphorus superbase and strongly&#8208;donating phosphine ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and properties of the much sought&#8208;after tris(1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylguanidinyl) phosphine P(tmg)  3  , a crystalline, superbasic phosphine accessible through a short and scalable procedure from the cheap and commercially available bulk chemicals 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylguanidine, tris(dimethylamino)phosphine and phosphorus trichloride. The new phosphine exhibits exceptional electron donor properties and readily forms transition metal complexes with gold(I), palladium(II) and rhodium(I) precursors. The formation of zwitterionic Lewis base adducts with carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide was explored. In addition, the complete series of phosphine chalcogenides was prepared from the reaction of P(tmg)  3  with N  2  O and the elemental chalcogens.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This report describes the synthesis of a [2.2]paracyclophane&#8208;derived annulated 3&#8208;amino&#8208;imidazole ligand library  via  a Groebke&#8211;Blackburn&#8211;Bienaym&#233; three&#8208;component reaction (GBB&#8208;3CR) employing formyl&#8208;cyclophanes in combination with diverse aliphatic and aromatic isocyanides and heteroaromatic amidines. The GBB&#8208;3CR gives access to differently functionalized skeletally&#8208;diverse cyclophanyl imidazole ligands, namely 3&#8208;amino&#8208;imidazo[1,2&#8208;  a  ]pyridines and imidazo[1,2&#8208;  a  ]pyrazines. Additionally, a one&#8208;pot protocol for the GBB&#8208;3CR by an  in&#8208;situ  generation of cyclophanyl isocyanide is demonstrated. The product formation was analyzed by detailed spectroscopic techniques, and a cyclophanyl imidazo[1,2&#8208;  a  ]pyridine was confirmed unambiguously by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;Ray crystallography. The cyclophanyl imidazole ligands can be readily transformed to showcase their useful utility in preparing  N  ,  C  &#8208;palladacycles  via  regioselective  ortho  &#8208;palladation.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rapid capture of 129 I with high volatility and toxicity in the environment has attracted much attention. Herein we reported a firstly synthesized nonporous material: pyridine N&#8208;oxides (NTPO and ATPO) as iodine adsorbent. Both of NTPO and ATPO exhibit remarkable performance on the adsorption of iodine in aqueous solution, vapor state and organic solvents. Upon the capture of iodine, pyridine N&#8208;oxides were transformed to binary cocrystals combined with the pyridine N&#8208;oxides and iodine which is driven by halogen bond between iodine and oxygen atoms. Moreover, pyridine N&#8208;oxides shows high chemical, thermal and moist stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Amination of Drug&#8208;Like Benzoic Acids: Access to Anilines and Drug Conjugates through Directed Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Added at the eleventh hour: A method for the late&#8208;stage directed amination of benzoic acids is presented. It allows rapid access to both small amino&#8208;functionalized analogues and large conjugates, including PROTACs, peptide conjugates and probes for chemical biology. Selection of the right catalyst and reagent enabled the use of high&#8208;throughput experimentation and automation.







Abstract
The functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds, ubiquitous in drugs and drug&#8208;like molecules, represents an important synthetic strategy with the potential to streamline the drug&#8208;discovery process. Late&#8208;stage aromatic C&#8722;N bond&#8211;forming reactions are highly desirable, but despite their significance, accessing aminated analogues through direct and selective amination of C&#8722;H bonds remains a challenging goal. The method presented herein enables the amination of a wide array of benzoic acids with high selectivity. The robustness of the system is manifested by the large number of functional groups tolerated, which allowed the amination of a diverse array of marketed drugs and drug&#8208;like molecules. Furthermore, the introduction of a synthetic handle enabled expeditious access to targeted drug&#8208;delivery conjugates, PROTACs, and probes for chemical biology. This rapid access to valuable analogues, combined with operational simplicity and applicability to high&#8208;throughput experimentation has the potential to aid and considerably accelerate drug discovery.

         <title>Development of an Enzyme&#8208;Inhibitor Reaction Using Cellular Retinoic Acid Binding Protein II for One&#8208;Pot Megamolecule Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic retinoid covalent inhibitor that targets the nucleophilic tyrosine residue in cellular retinoic acid binding protein II (CRABP2) in mild conditions was developed. This enzyme&#8208;inhibitor pair was integrated into the megamolecule assembly strategy to construct protein scaffolds in one&#8208;pot reactions. Here, three orthogonal enzyme&#8208;inhibitor reactions occurred simultaneously to form a homogeneous product without the use of protecting groups.







Abstract
This paper presents an enzyme building block for the assembly of megamolecules. The system is based on the inhibition of the human&#8208;derived cellular retinoic acid binding protein II (CRABP2) domain. We synthesized a synthetic retinoid bearing an arylfluorosulfate group, which uses sulfur fluoride exchange click chemistry to covalently inhibit CRABP2. We conjugated both the inhibitor and a fluorescein tag to an oligo(ethylene glycol) backbone and measured a second&#8208;order rate constant for the protein inhibition reaction of approximately 3,600&#8197;M&#8722;1s&#8722;1. We used this new enzyme&#8208;inhibitor pair to assemble multi&#8208;protein structures in one&#8208;pot reactions using three orthogonal assembly chemistries to demonstrate exact control over the placement of protein domains within a single, homogeneous molecule. This work enables a new dimension of control over specificity, orientation, and stoichiometry of protein domains within atomically precise nanostructures.

         <title>Synthesis of Extra&#8208;Large Pore, Large Pore and Medium Pore Zeolites Using a Small Imidazolium Cation as the Organic Structure&#8208;Directing Agent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using a small&#8208;sized imidazolium cation of facile synthesis as the organic structure&#8208;directing agent, three germanosilicate zeolites with extra&#8208;large, large and medium pores were synthesized. For the recently reported extra&#8208;large pore zeolite &#8208;SYT, the location of the organic cations was studied by molecular simulations, confirmed by Rietveld refinement and compared to that reported for the original, sophisticated and expensive &#8208;SYT cation.







Abstract
One common strategy in the search for new zeolites is the use of organic structure&#8208;directing agents (OSDA). Typically, one seeks to achieve a high specificity in the structure&#8208;directing effect of the OSDA. This study shows, however, that an OSDA lacking strong specificity towards any particular zeolite may provide opportunities for discovery when other synthesis parameters are systematically screened. Thus, 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;n&#8208;propylimidazolium has allowed to crystallize the new large/medium pore zeolite HPM&#8208;16 as well as the recently reported extra&#8208;large pore &#8208;SYT and the medium/small pore and chiral STW. The sophisticated OSDA originally affording &#8208;SYT and the new simple OSDA have very little in common, both in terms of size, shape and flexibility, while both may still direct the synthesis of the same zeolite. In fact, molecular simulations show that the new OSDA is located in three different positions of the &#8208;SYT structure, including the discrete 8MR where the original organic could not fit.

         <title>Modification of Amorphous Mesoporous Zirconia Nanoparticles with Bisphosphonic Acids: A Straightforward Approach for Tailoring the Surface Properties of the Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bisphosphonic acids provide a straightforward method for the covalent modification of the surface of mesoporous zirconia nanoparticles, with stronger affinity with respect to monophosphonate compounds. The modular synthesis of the bisphosphonic acids based on thio&#8208;Michael addition reaction on tetraethyl vinylidenebisphosphonate ester enables the preparation of zirconia nanoparticles with specific functional groups or charges on the surface.







Abstract
The use of readily prepared bisphosphonic acids obtained in few steps through a thio&#8208;Michael addition of commercially available thiols on tetraethyl vinylidenebisphosphonate enables the straightforward surface modification of amorphous mesoporous zirconia nanoparticles. Simple stirring of the zirconia nanoparticles in a buffered aqueous solution of the proper bisphosphonic acid leads to the surface functionalization of the nanoparticles with different kinds of functional groups, charge and hydrophobic properties. Formation of both chemisorbed and physisorbed layers of the bisphosphonic acid take place, observing after extensive washing a grafting density of 1.1 molecules/nm2 with negligible release in neutral or acidic pH conditions, demonstrating stronger loading compared to monophosphonate derivatives. The modified nanoparticles were characterized by IR, XPS, &#950;&#8208;potential analysis to investigate the loading of the bisphosphonic acid, FE&#8208;SEM to investigate the size and morphologies of the nanoparticles and 31P and 1H MAS NMR to investigate the coordination motif of the phosphonate units on the surface. All these analytical techniques demonstrated the strong affinity of the bisphosphonic moiety for the Zr(IV) metal centers. The functionalization with bisphosphonic acids represents a straightforward covalent approach for tailoring the superficial properties of zirconia nanoparticles, much straightforward compared the classic use of trisalkoxysilane or trichlorosilane reagents typically employed for the functionalization of silica and metal oxide nanoparticles. Extension of the use of bisphosphonates to other metal oxide nanoparticles is advisable.

         <title>Afterglow Implant for Arterial Embolization and Intraoperative Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) is wildly used in clinical treatments. However, the online monitoring of the thrombosis formation is limited due to the challenges of the direct visualization of embolic agents and the real&#8208;time monitoring of dynamic blood flow. Thus, we developed a photochemical afterglow implant with strong afterglow intensity and a long lifetime for embolization and imaging. The liquid pre&#8208;implant injected into the abdominal aorta of mice was rapidly transformed into a hydrogel  in situ  to embolize the blood vessel. The vascular embolism position can be observed by the enhanced afterglow of the fixed implant, and the long lifetime of afterglow can also be used to monitor the effect of embolization. This provides an excellent candidate in bio&#8208;imaging to avoid the autofluorescence interference from continuous light excitation. The study suggests the potential usefulness of the implant as an embolic agent in TAE and artery imaging during a surgical procedure.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational design of self&#8208;assembled mitochondria&#8208; targeting lytic peptide conjugates with&#160;enhanced tumor selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane lytic peptides (MLP) are widely explored as cellular delivery vehicles or antitumor/antibacterial agents. However, the poor selectivity between cancer and normal cells slims their prospects as potential anti&#8208;tumor drugs. Herein, we have developed a rationally designed self&#8208;assembly strategy to enhance tumor selectivity of MLP&#8208;based conjugates, incorporating a hydrophobic&#160;triphenylphosphonium&#160;(TPP) group for mitochondria targeting, and a hydrophilic Arginine&#8208;Glycine&#8208;Aspartic acid&#160;(RGD) sequence targeting integrin. The self&#8208;assembly nanoparticles can enhance the stability of the peptides in vitro &#160;plasma and be endocytosed selectively into the cancer cells. The histidine&#8208;rich lytic peptide component assists the disruption of endosomal/lysosomal membranes and subsequent the mitochondria membrane, which leads to apoptosis. This rational design of MLP&#8208;based conjugates provides a practical strategy to increase the application prospects of lytic peptides in cancer treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering the role of anions and secondary coordination sphere in tuning anisotropy in Dy(III) air&#8208;stable D5h SIMs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise control of the crystal field and symmetry around the paramagnetic spin centre has recently facilitated the engineering of high&#8208;temperature single&#8208;ion magnets (SIMs), the smallest possible units for future spin&#8208;based devices. In the present work, we report a series of air&#8208;stable seven coordinate Dy(III) SIMs {[L  2  Dy(H  2  O)  5  ][X]  3  &#183;L  2  &#183;  n  (H  2  O),  n  = 0, X = Cl (  1  ),  n  = 1, X = Br (  2  ), I (  3  )} possessing pseudo&#8208;  D  5h  symmetry&#160;with high energy barrier (  U  eff  ) and blocking temperature (  T  B  ). While the strong axial coordination from&#160;  t  BuPO(NH  i  Pr)  2  (  L  ), increases the overall anisotropy of the system, the presence of high symmetry significantly quenches quantum tunnelling of magnetization. The energy barrier (  U  eff  ) and the blocking temperature (  T  B  ) decrease in the order  3  &gt;  2  &gt;  1  with the change of anions from larger iodide to smaller strongly hydrogen&#8208;bonded chloride in the secondary coordination sphere, albeit the local coordination geometry and the symmetry around the Dy(III) display only slight deviations.  Ab initio  CASSCF/RASSI&#8208;SO/SINGLE_ANISO calculations further provide deeper insights into the dynamics of magnetic relaxation in addition to the role of the secondary coordination sphere in modulating the anisotropy of the  D  5h  systems, using diverse models. Thus, in addition to the importance of the crystal field and the symmetry to obtain high&#8208;temperature SIMs, this study also probes the significance of the secondary coordination sphere that can be tailored to accomplish novel SIMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Platinum&#8208;tin/tin oxide/CNT catalysts for high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic ethanol oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethanol is a promising liquid clean energy source in the energy conversion field. However, the self&#8208;poisoning caused by the strongly adsorbed reaction intermediates (typically, CO) is a critical problem in ethanol oxidation reaction. To address this issue, we proposed a joint use of two strategies, alloying of Pt with other metals and building Pt/metal&#8208;oxide interfaces, to achieve high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic ethanol oxidation. For this, a well&#8208;designed synthetic route combining wet impregnation with a two&#8208;step thermal treatment process was established to construct PtSn/SnO  x  interfaces on carbon nanotubes. Using this route, the alloying of Pt&#8208;Sn and formation of PtSn&#8208;SnO  x  interfaces can simultaneously be achieved, and the coverage of SnO  x  thin films on PtSn alloy nanoparticles can be facilely tuned by the strong interaction between Pt and SnO  x  . The results revealed that the partial coverage of SnO  x  species not only retained the active sites, but also enhanced the CO anti&#8208;poisoning ability of the catalyst. Consequently, the H&#8208;PtSn/SnO  x  /CNT&#8208;2 catalyst with an optimized PtSn&#8208;SnO  x  interface showed significantly improved performances toward the ethanol oxidation reaction (825 mA mg  Pt  &#8722;1  ). This study provides deep insights into the structure&#8208;performance relationship of PtSn/metal oxide composite catalysts, which would be helpful for the future design and fabrication of high&#8208;performance Pt&#8208;based ethanol oxidation reaction catalysts.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ethanol is a promising liquid clean energy source in the energy conversion field. However, the self-poisoning caused by the strongly adsorbed reaction intermediates (typically, CO) is a critical problem in ethanol oxidation reaction. To address this issue, we proposed a joint use of two strategies, alloying of Pt with other metals and building Pt/metal-oxide interfaces, to achieve high-performance electrocatalytic ethanol oxidation. For this, a well-designed synthetic route combining wet impregnation with a two-step thermal treatment process was established to construct PtSn/SnO  x  interfaces on carbon nanotubes. Using this route, the alloying of Pt-Sn and formation of PtSn-SnO  x  interfaces can simultaneously be achieved, and the coverage of SnO  x  thin films on PtSn alloy nanoparticles can be facilely tuned by the strong interaction between Pt and SnO  x  . The results revealed that the partial coverage of SnO  x  species not only retained the active sites, but also enhanced the CO anti-poisoning ability of the catalyst. Consequently, the H-PtSn/SnO  x  /CNT-2 catalyst with an optimized PtSn-SnO  x  interface showed significantly improved performances toward the ethanol oxidation reaction (825 mA mg  Pt  &#8722;1  ). This study provides deep insights into the structure-performance relationship of PtSn/metal oxide composite catalysts, which would be helpful for the future design and fabrication of high-performance Pt-based ethanol oxidation reaction catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cobaloxime Complex Salts: Synthesis, Patterning on Carbon Nanomembranes and Heterogeneous Hydrogen Evolution Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of a new cobaloxime&#8208;based double complex salt and its use as a catalyst for the homogeneous and heterogeneous, light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We successfully deposited these catalysts by scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) on supported and free&#8208;standing 2D amino&#8208;terminated carbon nanomembranes (CNMs) and quantified hydrogen by using Pd microsensors.







Abstract
Cobaloximes are promising, earth&#8208;abundant catalysts for the light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Typically, these cobalt(III) complexes are prepared in&#8197;situ or employed in their neutral form, for example, [Co(dmgH)2(py)Cl], even though related complex salts have been reported previously and could, in principle, offer improved catalytic activity as well as more efficient immobilization on solid support. Herein, we report an interdisciplinary investigation into complex salts [Co(dmgH)2(py)2]+[Co(dmgBPh2)2Cl2]&#8722;, 
 and [Co(dmgH)2(py)2]+BArF&#8722;. We describe their strategic syntheses from the commercially available complex [Co(dmgH)2(py)Cl] and demonstrate that these double and single complex salts are potent catalysts for the light&#8208;driven HER. We also show that scanning electrochemical cell microscopy can be used to deposit arrays of catalysts [Co(dmgH)2(py)2]+[Co(dmgBPh2)2Cl2]&#8722;, 
 and [Co(dmgH)2(py)Cl] on supported and free&#8208;standing amino&#8208;terminated &#8764;1&#8208;nm&#8208;thick carbon nanomembranes (CNMs). Photocatalytic H2 evolution at such arrays was quantified with Pd microsensors by scanning electrochemical microscopy, thus providing a new approach for catalytic evaluation and opening up novel routes for the creation and analysis of &#8220;designer catalyst arrays&#8221;, nanoprinted in a desired pattern on a solid support.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and properties of indeno[1,2,3,4&#8208; pqra ]perylene, which was prepared by the fusion of one anthracene unit with one naphthalene unit via three carbon&#8211;carbon bonds. The synthetic route through two&#8208;fold C&#8211;H arylation enabled not only the synthesis of unsubstituted indenoperylene, but also rapid access to its arylated derivatives on the gram scale. Indenoperylene is a medium&#8208;sized aromatic hydrocarbon with the composition C 24 H 12 that is isomeric to coronene. Nevertheless, its absorption covers the entire visible region owing to its small HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap. Furthermore, indenoperylene exhibits high stability despite the absence of peripheral substituents. We propose that the unique electronic structure of indenoperylene originates from the coexistence of an electron&#8208;withdrawing subunit (benzoaceanthrylene) and an electron&#8208;donating subunit (perylene). The electronic properties of indenoperylene were modulated via post&#8208;functionalization through regioselective bromination. The current research demonstrates that indenoperylene is a promising candidate as a main skeleton for near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive and redox&#8208;active materials.</dc:description>

Glipizide and glibenclamide remain some of the widely prescribed antidiabetic sulfonylurea drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Semi&#8208;telescoped continuous flow synthesis of both glipizide and glibenclamide are demonstrated herein which is accompanied by an overall yield of 80&#8211;85&#8201;% within 10&#8197;min total residence time.







Abstract
Glipizide and glibenclamide remain some of the widely prescribed antidiabetic sulfonylurea drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Herein the authors report on an isocyanate&#8208;free synthetic procedure towards the preparation of these on demand drugs at multigram scale using continuous flow technology. The safety concern over the use of isocyanates in most of the existing synthetic routes was dealt with in this present work by using N&#8208;carbamates synthesised in&#8197;situ from activation of amines with chloroformates as safer alternatives. An overall yield of 80&#8211;85&#8201;% was obtained for the semi&#8208;telescoped steps within 10&#8197;min total residence time.

Smarter crystallography, combining X&#8208;ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy revealed how interplay between carbonate and pH determines the LDH structure and Al ordering in ZnAl LDH. This study reveals the structure directing role of bivalent cations such as CO32&#8722; during crystallization of [M2+4M3+2(OH)2]2+[A2&#8722;]1&#8901;yH2O LDH phases.







Abstract
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) serve a score of applications in catalysis, drug delivery, and environmental remediation. Smarter crystallography, combining X&#8208;ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy revealed how interplay between carbonate and pH determines the LDH structure and Al ordering in ZnAl LDH. Carbonate intercalated ZnAl LDHs were synthesized at different pH (pH&#8197;8.5, pH&#8197;10.0, pH&#8197;12.5) with a Zn/Al ratio of 2, without subsequent hydrothermal treatment to avoid extensive recrystallisation. In ideal configuration, all Al cations should be part of the LDH and be coordinated with 6 Zn atoms, but NMR revealed two different Al local environments were present in all samples in a ratio dependent on synthesis pH. NMR&#8208;crystallography, integrating NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction, succeeded to identify them as Al residing in the highly ordered crystalline phase, next to Al in disordered material. With increasing synthesis pH, crystallinity increased, and the side phase fraction decreased. Using 1H&#8722;13C, 13C&#8722;27Al HETCOR NMR in combination with 27Al MQMAS, 27Al&#8208;DQ&#8208;SQ measurements and Rietveld refinement on high&#8208;resolution PXRD data, the extreme anion exchange selectivity of these LDHs for CO32&#8722; over HCO3&#8722; was linked to strict Al and CO32&#8722;ordering in the crystalline LDH. Even upon equilibration of the LDH in pure NaHCO3 solutions, only CO32&#8722; was adsorbed by the LDH. This reveals the structure directing role of bivalent cations such as CO32&#8722; during crystallization of [M2+4M3+2(OH)2]2+[A2&#8722;]1&#8901;yH2O LDH phases.

Tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene (TCBD) is a powerful and versatile electron&#8208;acceptor moiety widely used for the preparation of electroactive conjugates. Here, we expand the chemical space of such moiety through a high&#8208;yielding cyano&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder synthesis of a novel, thermally&#8208;stable anthryl&#8208;fused&#8208;TCBD derivative which presents intriguing physicochemical properties.







Abstract
Tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene (TCBD) is a powerful and versatile electron&#8208;acceptor moiety widely used for the preparation of electroactive conjugates. While many reports addressing its electron&#8208;accepting capability have appeared in the literature, significantly scarcer are those dealing with its chemical modification, a relevant topic which allows to broaden the chemical space of this interesting functional unit. Here, we report on the first example of a high&#8208;yielding cyano&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder (CDA) reaction between TCBD, that is, where a nitrile group acts as a dienophile, and an anthryl moiety, that is, acting as a diene. The resulting anthryl&#8208;fused&#8208;TCBD derivative, which structure was unambiguously identified by X&#8208;ray diffraction, shows high thermal stability, remarkable electron&#8208;accepting capability, and interesting electronic ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state features, as characterized by a thorough theoretical, electrochemical, and photophysical investigation. Moreover, a detailed kinetic analysis of the intramolecular CDA reaction transforming the anthryl&#8208;TCBD&#8208;based reactant into the anthryl&#8208;fused&#8208;TCBD product was carried out at different temperatures.

         <title>Steering Scholl Oxidative Heterocoupling by Tuning Topology and Electronics for Building Thiananographenes and Their Functional N&#8722;/C&#8722;Congeners</title>

Intramolecular thiophene&#8208;arene C&#8722;C heterocoupling is successfully achieved in a set of topologically and electronically engineered bis(biaryl)thiophenes (BATs) under Scholl oxidative conditions to provide symmetric and unsymmetric diphenanthrothiophenes (DPTs), simple thiananographenes. The thia&#8208;edge of diphenanthrothiophenes are conveniently transformed into blue&#8208;emissive and electrochemically stable N&#8722;/C&#8722;edged congeners.







Abstract
While intramolecular Scholl oxidative coupling between two arenes is common, successful C&#8722;C heterocoupling between thiophene and arene is scarce. The latter is due to the notorious reactivity of thiophene towards polymerization under oxidative conditions. This report systematically demonstrates how topological variation of electronics and reactivity in thiophene substrates can lead to efficient oxidative heterocoupling. Bis(biaryl)thiophenes having reactive &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;positions open are the choice of substrates. The cyclizing arene partners are so electronically tuned for thiophene's reactivity (at &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;) as to establish C&#8722;C bond oxidatively generating symmetrical as well as unsymmetrical diphenanthrothiophenes which are basic thiananographenes. Depending on the cyclizing&#8208;couple's electronics, either arene&#8208; or thiophene&#8208;centered oxidation initiates C&#8722;C heterocoupling. The potential utility of these simple thiananographenes is further unfurled by converting them to functional N&#8722;/C&#8208;graphene segments that are aza&#8208;corannulene precursor and tetrabenzospirobifluorene. Their bright emission and extended electrochemical stability are remarkable that may be potentially important and applicable.

         <title>A Pseudorotaxane System Containing &#947;&#8208;Cyclodextrin Formed via Chiral Recognition with an AuI6AgI3CuII3 Molecular Cap</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 64, Page 15981-15985, November 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pseudorotaxanes are created from an AuI6AgI3CuII3 complex with d&#8208;penicillamine combined with dicarboxylate and &#947;&#8208;CD via a solvent&#8208;mediated crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transformation. In the structure, a &#947;&#8208;CD ring is threaded by a dicarboxylate axle such that the smaller opening of &#947;&#8208;CD faces an AuI6AgI3CuII3 complex cap in a largely distorted manner. The corresponding complex with l&#8208;penicillamine does not accept a &#947;&#8208;CD ring in the structure.







Abstract
Solvent&#8208;mediated crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transformations of [Au6Ag3Cu3(H2O)3(d&#8208;pen)6(tdme)2]3+ (d&#8208;[1(H2O)3]3+; pen2&#8722;=penicillaminate, tdme=1,1,1&#8208;tris(diphenylphosphinomethyl)ethane) to form unique supramolecular species are reported. Soaking crystals of d&#8208;[1(H2O)3]3+ in aqueous Na2bdc (bdc2&#8722;=1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate) yielded crystals containing d&#8208;[1(bdc)(H2O)2]+ due to the replacement of a terminal aqua ligand in d&#8208;[1(H2O)3]3+ by a monodentate bdc2&#8722; ligand. When &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CD) was added to aqueous Na2bdc, d&#8208;[1(H2O)3]3+ was transformed to d&#8208;[1(bdc@&#947;&#8208;CD)(H2O)2]+, where a &#947;&#8208;CD ring was threaded by a bdc2&#8722; molecule to construct a pseudorotaxane structure. While the use of dicarboxylates with an aliphatic carbon chain instead of bdc2&#8722; afforded analogous pseudorotaxanes, such pseudorotaxane species were not formed when crystals of [Au6Ag3Cu3(H2O)3(l&#8208;pen)6(tdme)2]3+ (l&#8208;[1(H2O)3]3+) enantiomeric to d&#8208;[1(H2O)3]3+ were soaked in aqueous Na2bdc and &#947;&#8208;CD, affording only crystals containing l&#8208;[1(bdc)(H2O)2]+.

         <title>Tuning the Intrinsic Activity and Electrochemical Surface Area of MoS2 via Tiny Zn Doping: Toward an Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 64, Page 15992-15999, November 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn&#8208;doped MoS2 with S vacancies (Zn&#8722;Vs&#8722;MoS2, 1T phase) was developed for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Zn doping not only effectively increases the electrochemical specific surface area of MoS2 but also induces the formation of HER active 1T/2H&#8722;MoS2 phase and defects. Furthermore, it activates the in&#8208;plane sites of 1T&#8722;MoS2 so that the density of active sites and the intrinsic activity of reactive sites can be increased simultaneously. Therefore, the improved HER activity and stability are finally achieved.







Abstract
Molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) is considered as an alternative material for commercial platinum catalysts for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Improving the apparent HER activity of MoS2 to a level comparable to that of Pt is an essential premise for the commercial use of MoS2. In this work, a Zn&#8208;doping strategy is proposed to enhance the HER performance of MoS2. It is shown that tiny Zn doping into MoS2 leads to the enhancement of the electrochemical surface area, increases in proportion of HER active 1T phase in the material and formation of catalytic sites of higher intrinsic activity. These benefits result in a high&#8208;performance HER electrocatalyst with a low overpotential of 190&#8197;mV(@10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and a low Tafel slope of 58&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. The origin for the excellent electrochemical performance of the doped MoS2 is rationalized with both experimental and theoretical investigations.

         <title>Study of a Stable &#8220;Trifluoromethoxide Anion Solution&#8221; Arising from 2,4&#8208;Dinitro&#8208;Trifluoromethoxybenzene</title>

         <dc:description>
A stable solution of the trifluoromethoxide anion was readily obtained by mixing 2,4&#8208;dinitro&#8208;trifluoromethoxybenzene (DNTFB) and DMAP. A detailed study and characterization of this solution has been described, in particular highlighting the crucial role of the DNTFB/DMAP ratio. This &#8220;trifluoromethoxide anion solution&#8221; was applied to perform metal&#8208;free SN2 reactions on alkyl bomides with yields up to 77&#8201;%.







Abstract
Despite recent advances, trifluoromethoxylation remains a challenging reaction. Here we describe an efficient trifluoromethoxylative substitution, using an inexpensive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle reagent. By mixing DMAP with a slight excess of 1,4&#8208;dinitro&#8208;trifluoromethoxybenzene (DNTFB), a stable solution of trifluoromethoxide anion is obtained and can be used to perform a SN2 reaction without any silver additives. A precise study of the properties and behavior of this unusual stable solution of CF3O&#8722; species is also performed.

         <title>The Role of Common Alcoholic Sacrificial Agents in Photocatalysis: Is It Always Trivial?</title>

Making sacrifices: A good sacrificial agent in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction is not only determined by its rate of reaction with the holes, but also by the nature of products that can compete with the desired catalytic reaction and reduce its efficiency.







Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen production is proposed as a sustainable energy source. Simultaneous reduction and oxidation of water is a complex multistep reaction with high overpotential. Photocatalytic processes involving semiconductors transfer electrons from the valence band to the conduction band. Sacrificial substrates that react with the photochemically formed holes in the valence band are often used to study the mechanism of H2 production, as they scavenge the holes and hinder charge carrier recombination (electron&#8208;hole pairs). Here, we show that the desired sacrificial agent is one forming a radical that is a fairly strong reducing agent, and whose oxidized form is not a good electron acceptor that might suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In an acidic medium, methanol was found to fulfill both these requirements better than ethanol and propan&#8208;2&#8208;ol in the TiO2&#8208;(M0&#8208;NPs) (M=Au or Pt) system, whereas in an alkaline medium, the alcohols exhibit a reverse order of activity. Moreover, we report that CH2(OH)2 is by far the most efficient sacrificial agent in a nontrivial mechanism in acidic media. Our study provides general guidelines for choosing an appropriate sacrificial substrate and helps to explain the variance in the performance of alcohol scavenger&#8208;based photocatalytic systems.

The influence of microsolvation and encapsulation on the acceleration of the C&#8722;C reductive elimination from a Pt(IV) complex inside the [Ga4L6]12&#8722; metallocage is evaluated. The comparison with a related encapsulated Au(III) reaction shows that whereas the Gibbs energy barrier reduction is similar their contribution it is not.







Abstract
The reductive elimination on [(Me3P)2Pt(MeOH)(CH3)3]+, 2P, complex performed in MeOH solution and inside a [Ga4L6]12&#8722; metallocage are computationally analysed by mean of QM and MD simulations and compared with the mechanism of gold parent systems previously reported [Et3PAu(MeOH)(CH3)2]+, 2Au. The comparative analysis between the encapsulated Au(III) and Pt(IV)&#8208;counterparts shows that there are no additional solvent MeOH molecules inside the cavity of the metallocage for both systems. The Gibbs energy barriers for the 2P reductive elimination calculated at DFT level are in good agreement with the experimental values for both environments. The effect of microsolvation and encapsulation on the rate acceleration are evaluated and shows that the latter is far more relevant, conversely to 2Au. Energy decomposition analysis indicates that the encapsulation is the main responsible for most of the energy barrier reduction. Microsolvation and encapsulation effects are not equally contributing for both metal systems and consequently, the reasons of the rate acceleration are not the same for both metallic systems despite the similarity between them.

         <title>Elastic Organic Crystals Based on Barbituric Derivative: Multi&#8208;faceted Bending and Flexible Optical Waveguide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 64, Page 16036-16042, November 17, 2021. </description>

The D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A molecule (DBDT) was synthesized by a simple one&#8208;step reaction, and the centimeter&#8208;scale needle&#8208;like crystals were prepared by slow volatilization in DCM/CH3OH (v/v=2/8). Upon applying or removing the mechanical force, both the (100) and (040) faces of the needle&#8208;like crystal showed reversible bending behaviour, showing the nature of multi&#8208;faceted bending. Fortunately, the elastic crystals also exhibited optical waveguide characteristics in straight or bent state.







Abstract
Elastic organic single crystals with light&#8208;emitting and multi&#8208;faceted bending properties are extremely rare. They have potential application in optical materials and have attracted the extensive attention of researchers. In this paper, we reported a structurally simple barbituric derivative DBDT, which was easily crystallized and gained long needle&#8208;like crystals (centimeter&#8208;scale) in DCM/CH3OH (v/v=2/8). Upon applying or removing the mechanical force, both the (100) and (040) faces of the needle&#8208;like crystal showed reversible bending behaviour, showing the nature of multi&#8208;faceted bending. The average hardness (H) and elastic modulus (E) were 0.28&#177;0.01&#8197;GPa and 4.56&#177;0.03&#8197;GPa for the (040) plane, respectively. Through the analysis of the single crystal data, it could be seen that the van der waals (C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C), H&#8208;bond (C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O) and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions between molecules were responsible for the generation of the crystal elasticity. Interestingly, elastic crystals exhibited optical waveguide characteristics in straight or bent state. The optical loss coefficients measured at 627&#8197;nm were 0.7&#8197;dBmm&#8722;1 (straight state) and 0.9&#8197;dBmm&#8722;1 (bent state), while the optical loss coefficient (&#945;) were 1.5&#8197;dBmm&#8722;1 (straight state) and 1.8&#8197;dBmm&#8722;1 (bent state) at 567&#8197;nm. Notably, the elastic organic molecular crystal based on barbituric derivative could be used as the candidate for flexible optical devices.

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Promoted Oxidative Addition at a [Ni0(diphosphine)2] Complex: The Critical Role of a Secondary Coordination Sphere</title>

         <dc:description>
The elementary steps of metal&#8208;mediated catalysis e.&#8201;g., oxidative addition, transmetalation, and reductive elimination are pertinent to the design of superior routes into specialty chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals. For over 50&#8197;years, pioneering work has shown that 18&#8208;electron alkyl/aryl&#8208;substituted diphosphine complexes of Group 10 [M(diphosphine)2] do not oxidatively add haloarenes. Herein, we report a compound that is contrary to this &#8216;rule&#8217;, advancing our understanding of oxidative addition at coordinatively saturated organometallic complexes and providing new opportunities for bond activation.







Abstract
Oxidative addition represents a critical elementary step in myriad catalytic transformations. Here, the importance of thoughtful ligand design cannot be overstated. In this work, we report the intermolecular activation of iodobenzene (PhI) at a coordinatively saturated 18&#8208;electron [Ni0(diphosphine)2] complex bearing a Lewis acidic secondary coordination sphere. Whereas alkyl&#8208;substituted diphosphine complexes of Group 10 are known to be unreactive in such reactions, we show that [Ni0(P2BCy4)2] (P2BCy4=1,2&#8208;bis(di(3&#8208;dicyclohexylboraneyl)&#8208;propylphosphino)ethane) is competent for room&#8208;temperature PhI cleavage to give [NiII(P2BCy4)(Ph)(I)]. This difference in oxidative addition reactivity has been scrutinized computationally &#8211; an outcome that is borne out in ring&#8208;opening to provide the reactive precursor &#8211; for [Ni0(P2BCy4)2], a &#8220;boron&#8208;trapped&#8221; 16&#8208;electron &#954;1&#8208;diphosphine Ni(0) complex. Moreover, formation of [NiII(P2BCy4)(Ph)(I)] is inherent to the P2BCy4 secondary coordination sphere: treatment of the Lewis adduct, [Ni0(P2BCy4)2(DMAP)8] with PhI provides [NiII(P2BCy4)2(DMAP)8(I)]I via iodine&#8208;atom abstraction and not a [NiII(Ph)(I)(diphosphine)] compound &#8211; an unusual secondary sphere effect. Finally, the reactivity of [Ni0(P2BCy4)2] with 4&#8208;iodopyridine was surveyed, which resulted in a pyridyl&#8208;borane linked oligomer. The implications of these outcomes are discussed in the context of designing strongly donating, and yet labile diphosphine ligands for use in a critical bond activation step relevant to catalysis.

Novel alkynyl&#8208;functionalized diarylbis(dimethylamino)diboranes(4) were prepared and reacted with mono&#8208; and dihydroboranes, leading to hydroboration of the alkyne groups. The products are discrete boryl&#8208;appended diborane(4) species and oligomeric species, and are the first known examples of well&#8208;characterized macromolecular species with boron&#8208;boron bonds. The oligomeric products were found to comprise up to ten repeat units, and are soluble in common organic solvents.







Abstract
A number of novel alkynyl&#8208;functionalized diarylbis(dimethylamino)diboranes(4) are prepared by salt metathesis, and the appended alkynyl groups are subjected to hydroboration. Their reactions with monohydroboranes lead to discrete boryl&#8208;appended diborane(4) species, while dihydroboranes induce their catenation to oligomeric species, the first known examples of well&#8208;characterized macromolecular species with B&#8722;B bonds. The oligomeric species were found to comprise up to ten repeat units and are soluble in common organic solvents. Some of the oligomeric species have good air stability and all were characterized by NMR and vibrational spectroscopy and size&#8208;exclusion chromatography techniques.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Novel alkynyl-functionalized diarylbis(dimethylamino)diboranes(4)&lt;/b&gt; were prepared and reacted with mono- and dihydroboranes, leading to hydroboration of the alkyne groups. The products are discrete boryl-appended diborane(4) species and oligomeric species, and are the first known examples of well-characterized macromolecular species with boron-boron bonds. The oligomeric products were found to comprise up to ten repeat units, and are soluble in common organic solvents.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of novel alkynyl-functionalized diarylbis(dimethylamino)diboranes(4) are prepared by salt metathesis, and the appended alkynyl groups are subjected to hydroboration. Their reactions with monohydroboranes lead to discrete boryl-appended diborane(4) species, while dihydroboranes induce their catenation to oligomeric species, the first known examples of well-characterized macromolecular species with B&#8722;B bonds. The oligomeric species were found to comprise up to ten repeat units and are soluble in common organic solvents. Some of the oligomeric species have good air stability and all were characterized by NMR and vibrational spectroscopy and size-exclusion chromatography techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transmetalation Reactions of Aromatic Dilithionickelole: Synthesis of Heterobimetallic Complexes Featuring Metalloles as Diene Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 64, Page 15967-15972, November 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and efficient method to prepare Ni/M heterobimetallic complexes (M=Mg, Al, Sc, Lu, Pt) of the general formula (&#951;4&#8722;C4R4M)Ni(COD) (COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene) is realized through the transmetalation reactions of aromatic dilithionickelole. In these reactions, two electrons of the aromatic nickelole dianion transfer to the Ni atom, representing a novel reactivity compared with main&#8208;group metallole dianions. The bonding mode of these heterobimetallic complexes is studied by manifold experimental and theoretical analyses.







Abstract
The aromatic metallole dianions are important metallaaromatic compounds because of their various reactivities and extensive synthetic applications. Herein we report the reactions of dilithionickelole with MgCl2, EtAlCl2, Cp*ScCl2, Cp*LuCl2 and Pt(COD)Cl2 (COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene) affording a series of Ni/M heterobimetallic complexes of the general formula (&#951;4&#8722;C4R4M)Ni(COD), in which the metalloles act as diene ligands, as suggested by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray, NMR and theoretical analyses. In these reactions, two electrons of the nickelole dianion transferred to Ni, representing different reactivity compared with main&#8208;group metallole dianions.

         <title>Inherent Reactivity of Spiro&#8208;Activated Electrophilic Cyclopropanes</title>

Ring, ring! The reactivity of spiro&#8208;activated electrophilic cyclopropanes was studied by following the kinetics of their SN2&#8208;type ring&#8208;opening reactions with thiophenolate ions in DMSO at 20&#8201;&#176;C. The experimentally determined second&#8208;order rate constants (k2) correlated linearly with Mayr nucleophilicities N, basicities (pKaH), and Hammett substituent constants of the thiophenolates, but parabolic Hammett plots revealed variable electrophile&#8208;dependent effects on the stabilization of the transition states.







Abstract
The kinetics of the ring&#8208;opening reactions of thiophenolates with geminal bis(acceptor)&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes in DMSO at 20&#8201;&#176;C was monitored by photometric methods. The determined second&#8208;order rate constants of the SN2 reactions followed linear relationships with Mayr nucleophilicity parameters (N/sN) and Br&#248;nsted basicities (pKaH) of the thiophenolates as well as with Hammett substituent parameters (&#963;) for groups attached to the thiophenolates. Phenyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes reacted by up to a factor of 15 faster than their unsubstituted analogues, in accord with the known activating effect of adjacent &#960;&#8208;systems in SN2 reactions. Variation of the electronic properties of substituents at the phenyl groups of the cyclopropanes gave rise to parabolic Hammett relationships. Thus, the inherent SN2 reactivity of electrophilic cyclopropanes is activated by electron&#8208;rich &#960;&#8208;systems because of the more advanced C1&#8722;C2 bond polarization in the transition state. On the other hand, electron&#8208;poor &#960;&#8208;systems also lower the energetic barriers for the attack of anionic nucleophiles owing to attractive electrostatic interactions.

         <title>Crystal Structure Dependent Dissolution of Non&#8208;Cubic Au Crystallites in Aqua Regia</title>

Aqua regia readily dissolves the fcc tips of the Au bipyramidal crystallites and the core consisting of tetragonal and orthorhombic lattices, undergoes transformation to produce increased proportions of tetragonal lattices, before eventually giving up in dissolution. The study not only showcases the reactivity patterns associated with different Au lattices but also provides an insight into the lattice distribution within the crystallite.







Abstract
Properties of metal crystallites are governed by their morphologies and inherent crystal structures. In this work, bipyramidal Au microcrystallites hosting non&#8208;cubic lattices, body&#8208;centered orthorhombic and tetragonal (together termed as bc(o,t)), are investigated for their stability in aqua regia. Specifically, microcrystallites comprising 92&#8201;% of bc(o,t) have been subjected to aqua regia of different concentrations and the changes in morphology and lattice phases have been monitored using scanning electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques. The dissolution process was found to be crystal structure dependent and begin at the bipyramidal tips enriched with fcc lattice while retaining the bc(o,t) rich body. Interestingly, with increasing the reaction times, the remaining core was found to be highly reluctant to dissolution and instead, transformed to tetragonal lattices which with increasing treatment, exhibited lattice parameters closer to that of fcc. The study reveals the presence of a bc(o,t)&#8208;fcc core&#8208;shell structure with the tips enriched with fcc.

         <title>How to Look for Compounds: Predictive Screening and in&#8197;situ Studies in Na&#8722;Zn&#8722;Bi System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 64, Page 15954-15966, November 17, 2021. </description>

A structure prediction algorithm was used to assess the stability of the ternary compounds in the Na&#8722;Zn&#8722;Bi system followed by rapid experimental screening via the hydride synthesis route and in&#8197;situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Such a synergistic approach has yielded four new compounds in the previously &#8220;empty&#8221; Na&#8722;Zn&#8722;Bi system. The advanced electronic structure calculation for the synthesized compounds were performed to rationalize the experimentally observed non&#8208;stoichiometry, while in&#8197;situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed the high&#8208;temperature polymorphism.







Abstract
Here, the combination of theoretical computations followed by rapid experimental screening and in&#8197;situ diffraction studies is demonstrated as a powerful strategy for novel compounds discovery. When applied for the previously &#8220;empty&#8221; Na&#8722;Zn&#8722;Bi system, such an approach led to four novel phases. The compositional space of this system was rapidly screened via the hydride route method and the theoretically predicted NaZnBi (PbClF type, P4/nmm) and Na11Zn2Bi5 (Na11Cd2Sb5 type, P
) phases were successfully synthesized, while other computationally generated compounds on the list were rejected. In addition, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of NaZnBi indicate minor deviations from the stoichiometric 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 molar ratio. As a result, two isostructural (PbClF type, P4/nmm) Zn&#8208;deficient phases with similar compositions, but distinctly different unit cell parameters were discovered. The vacancies on Zn sites and unit cell expansion were rationalized from bonding analysis using electronic structure calculations on stoichiometric &#8220;NaZnBi&#8221;. In&#8208;situ synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction studies shed light on complex equilibria in the Na&#8722;Zn&#8722;Bi system at elevated temperatures. In particular, the high&#8208;temperature polymorph HT&#8208;Na3Bi (BiF3 type, Fm
m) was obtained as a product of Na11Zn2Bi5 decomposition above 611&#8197;K. HT&#8208;Na3Bi cannot be stabilized at room temperature by quenching, and this type of structure was earlier observed in the high&#8208;pressure polymorph HP&#8208;Na3Bi above 0.5&#8197;GPa. The aforementioned approach of predictive synthesis can be extended to other multinary systems.

The compositional space of this system was rapidly screened via the hydride route method and the theoretically predicted NaZnBi (PbClF type, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;4/&lt;i&gt;nmm&lt;/i&gt;) and Na&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (Na&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;Cd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; type, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;
) phases were successfully synthesized, while other computationally generated compounds on the list were rejected. In addition, single crystal X-ray diffraction studies of NaZnBi indicate minor deviations from the stoichiometric 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 molar ratio. As a result, two isostructural (PbClF type, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;4/&lt;i&gt;nmm&lt;/i&gt;) Zn-deficient phases with similar compositions, but distinctly different unit cell parameters were discovered. The vacancies on Zn sites and unit cell expansion were rationalized from bonding analysis using electronic structure calculations on stoichiometric &#8220;NaZnBi&#8221;. &lt;i&gt;In-situ&lt;/i&gt; synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction studies shed light on complex equilibria in the Na&#8722;Zn&#8722;Bi system at elevated temperatures. In particular, the high-temperature polymorph &lt;i&gt;HT&lt;/i&gt;-Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi (BiF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; type, &lt;i&gt;Fm&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;) was obtained as a product of Na&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; decomposition above 611&#8197;K. &lt;i&gt;HT&lt;/i&gt;-Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi cannot be stabilized at room temperature by quenching, and this type of structure was earlier observed in the high-pressure polymorph &lt;i&gt;HP&lt;/i&gt;-Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi above 0.5&#8197;GPa. The aforementioned approach of predictive synthesis can be extended to other multinary systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Janus all&#8208;cis 2,3,4,5,6&#8208;pentafluorocyclohexyl building blocks have been incorporated into medicinal chemistry type products. These cyclohexanes have polarized faces and represent a unique motif for medicinal chemistry. The paper introduces a range of new accessible building blocks which can be elaborated into a diversity of drug type structures demonstrating their wider utility for exploration in bioactives discovery chemistry.







Abstract
Monoalkylated derivatives of the unusually polar all&#8208;cis 2,3,4,5,6&#8208; pentafluorocyclohexyl (Janus face) motif are prepared starting from an aryl hydrogenation of 2,3,4,5,6&#8208; pentafluorophenylacetate methyl ester 15. The method used Zeng's Rh(CAAC) carbene catalyst 4 in the hydrogenation following the protocol developed by Glorius. The resultant Janus pentafluorocyclohexylacetate methyl ester 16 was converted to the corresponding alcohol 18, aldehyde 13, bromide 29 and azide 14 through functional group manipulations, and some of these building blocks were used in Ugi&#8208;multicomponent and Cu&#8208;catalysed click reactions. NBoc protected pentafluoroarylphenylalanine methyl ester 35 was also subject to an aryl hydrogenation, and then deprotection to generate the Janus face &#946;&#8208;pentafluorocyclohexyl&#8208;alanine amino acid 15, which was incorporated into representative members of an emerging class of candidate antiviral compounds. Log&#8197;P measurements demonstrate that the all&#8208;cis 2,3,4,5,6&#8208;pentafluorocyclohexyl ring system is more polar than a phenyl ring. In overview the paper introduces new building blocks containing this Janus ring and demonstrates their progression to molecules typically used in bioactives discovery programmes.

The kinetics of ring&#8208;opening reactions with thiophenolates in DMSO were monitored to assess the inherent SN2 reactivity of electrophilic cyclopropanes. Phenyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes reacted faster than their unsubstituted analogues. Variation in the electronic properties of substituents at the phenyl groups of the indandione&#8208;derived cyclopropanes gave rise to parabolic Hammett relationships, which revealed variable electrophile&#8208;dependent effects on the stabilization of the transition states.

Electrocatalytic water splitting has been considered as a promising strategy for sustainable evolution of hydrogen energy and storage of intermittent electric energy. A self&#8208;supported electrode architecture is highly attractive. Here, we intend to offer a timely and comprehensive review of MOFs&#8208;derived self&#8208;supported carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials for electrocatalytic water splitting and a deep analysis and understanding of the relationship between the component manipulation and their properties is also showed.

         <title>Frontispiece: Low&#8208;Temperature Electrolyte Design for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Prospect and Challenges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 64, November 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries have dominated the energy market from portable electronic devices to electric vehicles. However, the LIBs applications are limited seriously when they were operated in the cold regions and seasons if there is no thermal protection. This is because the Li+ transportation capability within the electrode and particularly in the electrolyte dropped significantly due to the decreased electrolyte liquidity, leading to a sudden decline in performance and short cycle&#8208;life. Thus, design a low&#8208;temperature electrolyte becomes ever more important to enable the further applications of LIBs. Herein the low&#8208;temperature electrolyte developments are summarized from the aspects of solvent, salt, additives, electrolyte analysis, and performance in the different battery systems. Recent new insights are also introduced about the cation solvation structure, which is significant to understand the interfacial behaviors at the low temperature, aiming to guide the design of a low&#8208;temperature electrolyte more effectively. For more information, see the Review by J. Zhang, J. Ming et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;15842.

         <title>Frontispiece: Tailoring the Properties of Optical Force Probes for Polymer Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 64, November 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optical force probes (OFPs) shine light on various unique mechanical behaviors of materials and allow the correlation of macroscopic mechanical properties with those of their molecular constituents. To accommodate the vastly diverse properties of polymers, OFPs must be tailored to account for the material requirements in energy (both light and force), in time, and in their spatially detectable resolution. Notable recent examples are highlighted and future challenges in this emergent field are identified in the Minireview by R. G&#246;stl et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;15889&#8197;ff.

As potential analytical tools for collecting and mapping mechanical information in polymer materials, optical force probes (OFPs) have been developed over the last decade. However, due to the diverse properties of polymers, it is necessary to devise tailored OFP solutions for such material requirements in energy (both light and force), in time, and in their spatially detectable resolution.

HER photocatalysis: Choosing the right sacrificial agent! The cover art features the alcoholic hole&#8208;scavenger requirements for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The desired sacrificial agent forms a relatively strong reducing radical and has an oxidized form that is not a good electron acceptor, which might suppress the HER process. Methanol, fulfilling these requirements, is an excellent choice. Moreover, CH2(OH)2 is the most efficient sacrificial agent in a nontrivial mechanism in acidic media. Our work aims to deepen understanding of the reaction mechanism and guidelines for selecting the best sacrificial agent. More information can be found in the Full Paper by R. Bar&#8208;Ziv, T. Zidki, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103040).

Abstract
Electrocatalytic water splitting has been considered as a promising strategy for the sustainable evolution of hydrogen energy and storage of intermittent electric energy. Efficient catalysts for electrocatalytic water splitting are urgently demanded to decrease the overpotentials and promote the sluggish reaction kinetics. Carbon&#8208;based composites, including heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon materials, metals/alloys@carbon composites, metal compounds@carbon composites, and atomically dispersed metal sites@carbon composites have been widely used as the catalysts due to their fascinating properties. However, these electrocatalysts are almost powdery form, and should be cast on the current collector by using the polymeric binder, which would result in the unsatisfied electrocatalytic performance. In comparison, a self&#8208;supported electrode architecture is highly attractive. Recently, self&#8208;supported metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) constructed by coordination of metal centers and organic ligands have been considered as suitable templates/precursors to construct free&#8208;standing carbon&#8208;based composites grown on conductive substrate. MOFs&#8208;derived carbon&#8208;based composites have various merits, such as the well&#8208;aligned array architecture and evenly distributed active sites, and easy functionalization with other species, which make them suitable alternatives to non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;included electrocatalysts. In this review, we intend to show the research progresses by employment of MOFs as precursors to prepare self&#8208;supported carbon&#8208;based composites. Focusing on these MOFs&#8208;derived carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials, the latest advances in their controllable synthesis, composition regulation, electrocatalytic performances in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and overall water splitting (OWS) are presented. Finally, the challenges and perspectives are showed for the further developments of MOFs&#8208;derived self&#8208;supported carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials in electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Electrolyte Design for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Prospect and Challenges</title>

The application of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) in cold regions and seasons is limited seriously due to the decreased Li+ transportation capability and sudden decline in performance. Here, an insightful viewpoint on the low&#8208;temperature electrolyte development and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) effect is given and a new insight about the Li+ solvation structure to understand the interfacial behaviors at the low temperature, aiming to guide the low&#8208;temperature electrolyte design more effectively is presented.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries have dominated the energy market from portable electronic devices to electric vehicles. However, the LIBs applications are limited seriously when they were operated in the cold regions and seasons if there is no thermal protection. This is because the Li+ transportation capability within the electrode and particularly in the electrolyte dropped significantly due to the decreased electrolyte liquidity, leading to a sudden decline in performance and short cycle&#8208;life. Thus, design a low&#8208;temperature electrolyte becomes ever more important to enable the further applications of LIBs. Herein, we summarize the low&#8208;temperature electrolyte development from the aspects of solvent, salt, additives, electrolyte analysis, and performance in the different battery systems. Then, we also introduce the recent new insight about the cation solvation structure, which is significant to understand the interfacial behaviors at the low temperature, aiming to guide the design of a low&#8208;temperature electrolyte more effectively.

         <title>Early Physical Organic Chemistry: Nikolai Aleksandrovich Menshutkin (1842&#8211;1907) and Reaction Velocities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 64, Page 15829-15841, November 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Forgotten history: Nikolai Aleksandrovich Menshutkin was a multifaceted chemist who systematically applied kinetics to the study of the effects of reactant structure on the rate of esterification of alcohols with carboxylic acids, and the quaternization of amines with alkylhalides. These last reactions gave evidence of an element effect and dramatic solvent effects.







Abstract
The name of Menshutkin is most frequently associated with his eponymous reaction (the quaternization of tertiary amines with alkyl halides). However, he made encyclopedic contributions to the field of reaction kinetics, where he carried out extensive studies of the effects of reactant structure on the rates of esterification of monohydric, dihydric and trihydric alcohols with monocarboxylic acids, and monobasic and dibasic carboxylic acids and anhydrides with monohydric alcohols. In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols. The wide&#8208;ranging work of Menshutkin, the physical organic chemist, is discussed.

         <title>Tailoring the Properties of Optical Force Probes for Polymer Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 64, Page 15889-15897, November 17, 2021. </description>

In recent years, notable works on adjusting optical force probes in their responses to energy (both light and force), in time, and in their spatially detectable resolution have been published and help unraveling the macroscopic with relation to the molecular mechanical properties of polymer materials. Here, notable examples that put a dent in the universe of optical force sensing are highlighted.







Abstract
The correlation of mechanical properties of polymer materials with those of their molecular constituents is the foundation for their holistic comprehension and eventually for improved material designs and syntheses. Over the last decade, optical force probes (OFPs) were developed, shedding light on various unique mechanical behaviors of materials. The properties of polymers are diverse, ranging from soft hydrogels to ultra&#8208;tough composites, from purely elastic rubbers to viscous colloidal solutions, and from transparent glasses to super black dyed coatings. Only very recently, researchers started to develop tailored OFP solutions that account for such material requirements in energy (both light and force), in time, and in their spatially detectable resolution. We here highlight notable recent examples and identify future challenges in this emergent field.

         <title>Perfluorinated Trialkoxysilanol with Dramatically Increased Br&#248;nsted Acidity</title>

Fluorine makes the difference: The Br&#248;nsted acidity of tris&#8208;(tert&#8208;butoxy)silanol dramatically increases when the substituents are decorated by 27 fluorine atoms.







Abstract
The Br&#248;nsted acidity of the perfluorinated trialkoxysilanol {(F3C)3CO}3SiOH is more than 13 orders of magnitude higher than that of orthosilicic acid, Si(OH)4, and even more for most previously known silanols. It is easily deprotonated by simple amines and pyridines to give the conjugate silanolates [OSi{OC(CF3)3}3]&#8722;, which possess extremely short Si&#8722;O bonds, comparable to those of silanones.

         <title>Reversible pH&#8208;Controlled Catenation of a Benzobisimidazole&#8208;Based Tetranuclear Rectangle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 64, Page 15922-15927, November 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;sensitive metalla&#8208;rectangle constructed from the benzobisimidazole (BBI) framework dimerizes in solution to form a catenane. It can be dissociated thanks to three different pathways: dilution, addition of pyrene to form a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8208;guest complex and selective protonation of the bisimidazole rings. The latter process is reversible through addition of a base and occurs without any sign of disassembling.







Abstract
The development of methodologies to control on demand and reversibly supramolecular transformations from self&#8208;assembled metalla&#8208;structures requires the rational design of architectures able to answer to an applied stimulus. While solvent or concentration changes, light exposure or addition of a chemical have been largely explored to provide these transformations, the case of pH sensitive materials is less described. Herein, we report the first example of a pH&#8208;triggered dissociation of a coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembled interlocked molecular link. It incorporates a pH sensitive benzobisimidazole&#8208;based ligand that can be selectively protonated on its bisimidazole moieties. This generates intermolecular electrostatic repulsions that reduces drastically the stability of the interlocked structure, leading to its dissociation without any sign of protonation of the pyridine moieties involved in the coordination bonds. Importantly, the dissociation process is reversible through addition of a base.

         <dc:description>
An efficient nickel&#8208;catalyzed regioselective hydroarylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with aryl halides and using silanes as hydride source is developed, affording functionalized arenes in good to excellent yields under mild conditions. The protocol shows a high tolerance to various functional groups on both the dienes and aryl coupling partners. Mechanism studies indicate that &#960;&#8208;allyl nickel species is likely to be involved in the catalysis.







Abstract
An efficient nickel&#8208;catalyzed regioselective hydroarylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with aryl halides and a silane has been developed, affording a range of allylic arenes in good to excellent yields under mild conditions. This method exhibits broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group tolerance. Late&#8208;stage modification of complex architectures was demonstrated.

A rare three&#8208;coordinate germanone: bis(imino)germanone [IPrN]2Ge=O (IPrN=bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;imino) was successfully isolated. Initial reactivity studies combined with experimental and computational bonding analysis revealed highly polarized nature of the terminal Ge=O bond. Moreover, transition metal oxide&#8208;like reactivity has been observed for the addition of phenylacetylene, as well as O&#8208;atom transfer with 2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl isocyanide.







Abstract
A rare three&#8208;coordinate germanone [IPrN]2Ge=O (IPrN=bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;imino) was successfully isolated. The germanone has a rather high thermal stability in arene solvent, and no detectable change was observed at 80&#8201;&#176;C for at least one week. However, high thermal stability of [IPrN]2Ge=O does not prevent its reactivity toward small molecules. Structural analysis and initial reactivity studies revealed the highly polarized nature of the terminal Ge=O bond. Besides, the addition of phenylacetylene, as well as O&#8208;atom transfer with 2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl isocyanide make it a mimic of nucleophilic transition&#8208;metal oxides. Mechanism for O&#8208;atom transfer reaction was investigated via DFT calculations, which revealed that the reaction proceeds via a [2+2] cycloaddition intermediate.

         <title>High Fidelity Enzyme&#8208;Free Primer Extension with an Ethynylpyridone Thymidine Analog</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 64, Page 15918-15921, November 17, 2021. </description>

Strongly binding analog: When thymidine is replaced with ethynylmethylpyridone, enzyme&#8208;free genetic copying occurs faster and with higher fidelity.







Abstract
High fidelity base pairing is important for the transmission of genetic information. Weak base pairs can lower fidelity, complicating sequencing, amplification and replication of DNA. Thymidine 5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate (TMP) is the most weakly pairing nucleotide among the canonical deoxynucleotides, causing high errors rates in enzyme&#8208;free primer extension. Here we report the synthesis of an ethynylpyridone C&#8208;nucleoside analog of 3&#8242;&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;dideoxythymidine monophosphate and its incorporation in a growing strand by enzyme&#8208;free primer extension. The ethynylpyridone C&#8208;nucleotide accelerates extension more than five&#8208;fold, reduces misincorporation and readily displaces TMP in competition experiments. The results bode well for the use of the C&#8208;nucleoside as replacements for thymidine in practical applications.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Tri&#8208;/Difluoromethyl Ketones from Carboxylic Acids by Cross&#8208;Coupling with Acyloxyphosphonium Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 64, Page 15908-15913, November 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advantageous synthetic route: Deoxytrifluoromethylation and difluoromethylation of carboxylic acids give access to di&#8208; and trifluoromethyl ketones. The key to the success of these transformations is the use of acyloxyphosphonium ions prepared in&#8197;situ as acyl electrophiles. The protocols use extremely mild reaction conditions and short reactions times and can tolerate a wide range of functional groups.







Abstract
A simple and straightforward approach to the synthesis of trifluoromethyl and difluoromethyl ketones from widely available carboxylic acids is disclosed. The transformation utilizes an acyloxyphosphonium ion as the active electrophile, conveniently generated in&#8197;situ from the carboxylic acid substrate by using commodity chemicals. The utility of the reaction system is exemplified by its chemoselectivity, with tolerance to a variety of important functional groups. The late&#8208;stage functionalization of carboxylic acid active pharmaceutical ingredients and pharmaceutically relevant compounds is also discussed.

         <dc:description>The polymorphs of  2ClChMe&#8208;4  in Form I (ribbon&#8208;like crystal) and Form II (block&#8208;like crystal) were prepared, and they exhibited curling/flipping and expansion upon heating on account of the single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformations. The irreversible phase transformations occurred separately at 53.2 &#176;C and 57.8 &#176;C for the crystals in Form I and Form II, during which the molecular conformation of  2ClChMe&#8208;4  changed and the molecules slipped along (100) plane. As a result, the movements at the molecular level resulted in the changes of cell parameters, which in turn led to the macroscopic motions of the crystals upon heating. Additionally, the ribbon&#8208;like crystals of  2ClChMe&#8208;4  showed photo&#8208;induced bending driven by the [2+2] cycloaddition. Accordingly, the actuator showing reversible bending behaviors was fabricated triggered by light and heat successively. As the biomimetic self&#8208;actuators, such multi&#8208;stimuli mechanical responsive molecular crystals might have potential applications in soft robots, artificial muscles and microfluidic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin&#8208;spin Coupling Controls the Gas&#8208;phase Reactivity of Aromatic &#963;&#8208;Type Triradicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Examination of the reactions of &#963;&#8208;type quinolinium&#8208;based triradicals with cyclohexane in the gas phase demonstrated that  the radical site that is the least strongly coupled to the other two radical sites reacts first, independent of the intrinsic reactivity of this radical site,  in contrast to related biradicals that first react at the most  electron&#8208;deficient  radical site. Abstraction of one or two H atoms and formation of an ion that formally corresponds to a combination of the ion and cyclohexane accompanied by elimination of a H atom (&#8220;addition &#8211; H&#8221;) were observed. In all cases except one, the most reactive radical site of the triradicals is  intrinsically less reactive  than the other two radical sites. The product complex of the H abstraction either dissociates to give the H atom abstraction product and the cyclohexyl radical or the more reactive radical site in the produced biradical abstracts a H atom from the cyclohexyl radical. The monoradical product can add&#160;to cyclohexene followed by elimination of a H atom, generating the &#8220;addition &#8211; H&#8221; products. Similar reaction efficiencies were measured for three of the triradicals as for relevant monoradicals. Surprisingly, the remaining three triradicals (all with&#160;a  meta  &#8208;pyridyne moiety)  reacted substantially faster than the relevant monoradicals  . This is rationalized based on the exothermic generation of the same  meta  &#8208;pyridyne analog for these three triradicals has enough energy to attain  the dehydrocarbon atom separation common for H atom abstraction transition states  of protonated  meta  &#8208;pyridynes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The formation of new benzothiazine heterocycles have been achieved starting from thiourea derivatives and using different gold catalysts. The catalyst and the conditions have been optimised towards the selective synthesis of 6&#8208;membered benzothiazine heterocycles, characterised by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Interestingly, these organic compounds evolved under gold catalysis in basic medium to achieve the formation of amino thioquinolines through an unprecedented aromatisation process of the heterocycle. The reaction has also been carried out stoichiometrically by reaction of gold complexes to afford the thioquinolines coordinated to the gold fragment. Benzothiazine, amino thioquinoline heterocycles and gold derived species have a great potential for biological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Electroreductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of Trifluoromethyl Alkenes and Redox Active Esters for the Synthesis of Gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electroreductive decarboxylative/defluorinative cross&#8208;coupling between redox&#8208;active esters and &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl styrenes enabled the access to a wide range of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes. The transformation can be conducted efficiently under simple metal&#8208;free reaction conditions and features a broad scope with high yields.







Abstract
An electroreductive access to gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes has been developed through the decarboxylative/defluorinative coupling of N&#8208;hydroxyphtalimides esters and &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkenes. The electrolysis is performed under very simple reaction conditions in an undivided cell using cheap carbon graphite electrodes. This metal&#8208;free transformation features broad scope with good to excellent yields. Tertiary, secondary as well as primary alkyl radicals could be easily introduced. &#945;&#8208;aminoacids L&#8208;aspartic and L&#8208;glutamic acid&#8208;derived redox active esters were good reactive partners furnishing potentially relevant gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes. In addition, it has been demonstrated that our electrosynthetic approach toward the synthesis of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes could use an easily prepared Kratitsky salt as alkyl radical precursor via a deaminative/defluorinative carbofunctionalization of trifluoromethylstyrene.

Large versus small: The impact of two different NHC ligands in complexes [Ni(NHC)2] and the behavior of the complexes towards alkynes is presented. It demonstrates how small differences in the stereo&#8208;electronic features of closely related ligands can significantly alter the reactivity pattern. The reaction of (suitable precursors of) both complexes with alkynes gave &#951;2&#8208;(C,C)&#8208;alkyne complexes [Ni(NHC)2](&#951;2&#8208;alkyne)], although the number of complexes available for [Ni(Mes2Im)2] is limited to small alkynes and good acceptor alkynes.







Abstract
A case study on the effect of the employment of two different NHC ligands in complexes [Ni(NHC)2] (NHC=iPr2ImMe 1Me, Mes2Im 2) and their behavior towards alkynes is reported. The reaction of a mixture of [Ni2(iPr2ImMe)4(&#956;&#8208;(&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2)&#8208;COD)] B/ [Ni(iPr2ImMe)2(&#951;4&#8208;COD)] B&#8217; or [Ni(Mes2Im)2] 2, respectively, with alkynes afforded complexes [Ni(NHC)2(&#951;2&#8208;alkyne)] (NHC=iPr2ImMe: alkyne=MeC&#8801;CMe 3, H7C3C&#8801;CC3H7 4, PhC&#8801;CPh 5, MeOOCC&#8801;CCOOMe 6, Me3SiC&#8801;CSiMe3 7, PhC&#8801;CMe 8, HC&#8801;CC3H7 9, HC&#8801;CPh 10, HC&#8801;C(p&#8208;Tol) 11, HC&#8801;C(4&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H4) 12, HC&#8801;CCOOMe 13; NHC=Mes2Im: alkyne=MeC&#8801;CMe 14, MeOOCC&#8801;CCOOMe 15, PhC&#8801;CMe 16, HC&#8801;C(4&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H4) 17, HC&#8801;CCOOMe 18). Unusual rearrangement products 11&#8201;a and 12&#8201;a were identified for the complexes of the terminal alkynes HC&#8801;C(p&#8208;Tol) and HC&#8801;C(4&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H4), 11 and 12, which were formed by addition of a C&#8722;H bond of one of the NHC N&#8208;iPr methyl groups to the C&#8801;C triple bond of the coordinated alkyne. Complex 2 catalyzes the cyclotrimerization of 2&#8208;butyne, 4&#8208;octyne, diphenylacetylene, dimethyl acetylendicarboxylate, 1&#8208;pentyne, phenylacetylene and methyl propiolate at ambient conditions, whereas 1Me is not a good catalyst. The reaction of 2 with 2&#8208;butyne was monitored in some detail, which led to a mechanistic proposal for the cyclotrimerization at [Ni(NHC)2]. DFT calculations reveal that the differences between 1Me and 2 for alkyne cyclotrimerization lie in the energy profile of the initiation steps, which is very shallow for 2, and each step is associated with only a moderate energy change. The higher stability of 3 compared to 14 is attributed to a better electron transfer from the NHC to the metal to the alkyne ligand for the N&#8208;alkyl substituted NHC, to enhanced Ni&#8208;alkyne backbonding due to a smaller CNHC&#8722;Ni&#8722;CNHC bite angle, and to less steric repulsion of the smaller NHC iPr2ImMe.

         <title>MicroRNA&#8208;Triggered Nanozymes Cascade Reaction for Tumor&#8208;Specific Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microRNA&#8208;triggered nanozymes cascade platform was constructed for tumor&#8208;specific chemodynamic therapy. Glucose oxidase&#8208;like nanozyme and peroxidase&#8208;like nanozyme were brought into close proximity through hybridization with miRNA&#8208;21 in MCF&#8208;7 cancer cells, resulting in efficient production of hydroxyl radicals to kill cancer cells. The system presented enhanced catalytic activity and minimal off&#8208;target toxicity, and provided an effective strategy for tumor&#8208;specific chemodynamic therapy.







Abstract
Off&#8208;target toxicity and insufficient hydroxyl radicals (.OH) generation limit the further clinical application of nanozymes in chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Herein, we designed and constructed a microRNA&#8208;triggered nanozyme cascade platform for enhanced tumor&#8208;specific chemodynamic therapy. The nanozyme&#8208;based cascade reaction could be triggered successfully by the high expression of microRNA in cancer cells to generate more .OH, thus exhibiting excellent tumor&#8208;specific therapeutic performance. Our work provides a new dimension for tumor&#8208;specific chemodynamic therapy.

         <title>On the Reduction of MoO3 to MoO2: A Path to Control the Particle Size and Morphology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling the hydrogen reduction of molybdenum trioxide to molybdenum dioxide and eventually metallic molybdenum with desirable morphology is a topic of continual scientific interest. Herein, this work presents a method of forming a wide range of grain sizes of the crucial molybdenum dioxide intermediary product by the adjustment of parameters such as temperature, water content and potassium content, further elucidating this first reduction step.







Abstract
During the reduction of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) to metallic molybdenum, the first reduction step yielding molybdenum dioxide as an intermediary product is of crucial importance. In this study, we examined the impact of the parameters reduction temperature, water influx, and potassium content on the hydrogen reduction of this first reaction step. Beginning from the same starting material, the chemical vapor transport mechanism was utilized to yield the phase pure MoO2. Analyses including powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, inductively coupled plasma&#8208;mass spectrometry, scanning electron microscopy, and high performance optical microscopy were performed on the product phases. Modulations of the specific surface areas of molybdenum dioxide ranging from 2.28 to 0.41&#8197;m2/g were possible. Furthermore, a distinct shift from small plate&#8208;like grains to cuboid&#8208;like forms was achieved.

         <title>Versatile Para&#8208;Substituted Pyridine Lanthanide Coordination Complexes Allow Late Stage Tailoring of Complex Function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of cationic and neutral p&#8208;bromo and p&#8208;nitropyridine substituted Eu(III) and Gd(III) coordination complexes serve as versatile synthetic intermediates. This approach allows the late stage tuning of absorption and emission spectroscopic properties for Eu(III) complexes, and provides easy access to the corresponding Eu(II) analogues, aiding the development of Gd(III) EPR spin probes that can be readily conjugated to biomolecules, under mild conditions.







Abstract

         <title>Chiral Ligands in Hypervalent Iodine Compounds: Synthesis and Structures of Binaphthyl&#8208;based &#955;3&#8208;Iodanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several novel binaphthyl&#8208;based chiral hypervalent iodine(III) reagents have been prepared and structurally analyzed. Various asymmetric oxidative reactions were applied to evaluate the reactivities and stereoselectivities of those reagents. Moderate to excellent yields were observed, however, very low stereoselectivities were obtained. The NMR experiments indicate that these reagents are very easily hydrolyzed in either chloroform or DMSO solvents leading to limited stereoselectivities. It is concluded that the use of chiral ligands is an unsuccessful way to prepare efficient stereoselective iodine(III) reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordinatively Unsaturated Amidotitanocene Cations with Inverted &#963; and &#960; Bond Strengths: Controlled Release of Aminyl Radicals and Hydrogenation/Dehydrogenation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amidotitanocene cations serve as versatile, &#8220;bottlable&#8221; precursors for a range of highly reactive species such as aminyl radicals, and active catalysts for hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions. Their catalytic performance in amine&#8208;silane dehydrocoupling is the highest recorded so far for an earth&#8208;abundant metal (TON up to 3960). The Ti&#8722;N interaction displays reversed &#963; and &#960; bond strengths, as shown by EDA&#8208;NOCV calculations.







Abstract
Cationic amidotitanocene complexes [Cp2Ti(NPhAr)][B(C6F5)4] (Cp=&#951;5&#8208;C5H5; Ar=phenyl (1&#8201;a), p&#8208;tolyl (1&#8201;b), p&#8208;anisyl (1&#8201;c)) were isolated. The bonding situation was studied by DFT (Density Functional Theory) using EDA&#8208;NOCV (Energy Decomposition Analysis with Natural Orbitals for Chemical Valence). The polar Ti&#8722;N bond in 1&#8201;a&#8211;c features an unusual inversion of &#963; and &#960; bond strengths responsible for the balance between stability and reactivity in these coordinatively unsaturated species. In solution, 1&#8201;a&#8211;c undergo photolytic Ti&#8722;N cleavage to release Ti(III) species and aminyl radicals &#8901;NPhAr. Reaction of 1&#8201;b with H3BNHMe2 results in fast homolytic Ti&#8722;N cleavage to give [Cp2Ti(H3BNHMe2)][B(C6F5)4] (3). 1&#8201;a&#8211;c are highly active precatalysts in olefin hydrogenation and silanes/amines cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling, whilst 3 efficiently catalyzes amine&#8208;borane dehydrogenation. The mechanism of olefin hydrogenation was studied by DFT and the cooperative H2 activation key step was disclosed using the Activation Strain Model (ASM).

         <title>Fe&#8208;ZIF8 Coating Cu Foil Derived Carbon as A pH&#8208;universal Electrocatalyst for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is a great challenge to fabricate highly efficient pH&#8208;universal electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, a facile strategy, which includes coating the Fe modified ZIF8 on Cu foil and in&#8208;situ pyrolysis to evaporate and dope Cu into the MOF derived carbon, is developed to fabricate Fe/Cu&#8208;N co&#8208;doped carbon material (Cu/Fe&#8208;NC). Profiting from the modulated electron distribution and textual properties, well&#8208;designed Cu/Fe&#8208;NC exhibits superior half&#8208;wave potential (E  1/2  ) of 0.923 V in alkaline, 0.757 V in neutral and comparable 0.801 V in acid electrolytes, respectively. Furthermore, the ultralow peroxides yield of ORR demonstrates the high selectivity of Cu/Fe&#8208;NC in full pH scale electrolytes. As expected, the self&#8208;made alkaline and neutral zinc&#8208;air batteries equipped with Cu/Fe&#8208;NC cathode display excellent discharge voltages, outstanding peak power densities and remarkable stability. This work opens a new way to fabricate highly efficient and pH&#8208;universal electrocatalysts for ORR through strategy of Fe/Cu&#8208;N co&#8208;doping, Cu foil evaporation and carbon defects capture.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We successfully isolated and characterized the zinc carbamate complex (phen)Zn(OAc)(OC(=O)NHPh) (  1  , phen = 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline), formed as an intermediate during the Zn(OAc)  2  /phen&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of organic carbamates from CO  2  , amines, and the reusable reactant Si(OMe)  4  . Density functional theory calculations revealed that the direct reaction of  1  with Si(OMe)  4  proceeds via a 5&#8208;coordinate silicon intermediate, forming organic carbamates. Based on these results, the catalytic system was improved by using Si(OMe)  4  as the reaction solvent and additives like KOMe and KF, which promote the formation of the 5&#8208;coordinated silicon species. This sustainable and effective method can be used to synthesize various  N  &#8208;aryl and  N  &#8208;alkyl carbamates, including industrially important polyurethane raw materials, starting from CO  2  under atmospheric pressure.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>High&#8208;valent tetraalkylcuprates(III) and &#8208;argentates(III) are key intermediates of copper and silver&#8208;mediated C&#8722;C coupling reactions.

The gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments confirmed the preferred formation of the [RCuMe]  &#8722;  anion upon collisional activation of the cuprate(III) species, consistent with a homo&#8208;coupling reaction, whereas the silver analogue primarily yielded [AgMe  2  ]  &#8722;  , consistent with a cross&#8208;coupling reaction. For both complexes, density functional theory calculations identified one mechanism for homo coupling and four different ones for cross coupling. Of these pathways, an unprecedented concerted  outer&#8208;sphere  cross coupling is of particular interest, because it can explain the formation of [AgMe  2  ]  &#8722;  from the argentate(III) species. Remarkably, the different C&#8722;C coupling propensities of the two [RM  III  Me  3  ]  &#8722;  complexes become only apparent when properly accounting for the multi&#8208;configurational character of the wave function for the key transition state of [RAgMe  3  ]  &#8722;  . Backed by the obtained detailed mechanistic insight for the gas&#8208;phase reactions, we propose that the previously observed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of the silver complex in solution proceeds via the  outer&#8208;sphere  mechanism.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Cervical cancer, as a common malignant tumor of reproductive system, seriously threatens women's life and health. Traditional treatments, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, are difficult to cure cervical cancer. Fortunately, tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;activated catalytic therapy with high efficiency and reduced off&#8208;target toxicity has emerged as a novel treatment model. Herein, we designed &#8220;four&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; nanozyme and natural enzyme symbiotic system of Cu  2&#8208;x  Se&#8208;GOx for TME&#8208;triggered cascaded catalytic enhanced cancer treatment. In response to unique TME, the Cu  2&#8208;x  Se with catalase activity could effectively catalyze over&#8208;expressed H  2  O  2  in cancer cells into O  2  . Subsequently, the glucose oxidase (GOx) could deplete intracellular glucose under the assistance of O  2  , which not only achieves starvation therapy, but also regenerates H  2  O  2  to boost the generation of highly cytotoxic &#183;OH due to the peroxidase activity of Cu  2&#8208;x  Se. Moreover, although glutathione (GSH) as a free radical scavenger is overexpressed in tumor cells, the Cu  2&#8208;x  Se with glutathione oxidase activity could effectively consume GSH for enhanced ROS production. Thus, the &#8220;four&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; nanozyme@natural enzyme symbiotic system of Cu  2&#8208;x  Se&#8208;GOx could significantly induce ROS accumulation at the tumor regions, which provides a potential approach for the treatment of cervical cancer.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Electronegativity and the Bridging of Chemical Bonding Concepts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The orbital and the density, hand in hand: Three perspectives for conceptualizing chemical bonding are connected here within one framework: experimental quantum chemistry. A new definition for atoms inside molecules leads to quantification of atomic energy, partial charge, and in&#8208;situ electronegativity. Predictions follow, of pKa, of electronegativity inversions in polar bonds, and of hydrogen stabilization&#8208;driven electron&#8208;deficient bonding in diborane.







Abstract
One challenge in chemistry is the plethora of often disparate models for rationalizing the electronic structure of molecules. Chemical concepts abound, but their connections are often frail. This work describes a quantum&#8208;mechanical framework that enables a combination of ideas from three approaches common for the analysis of chemical bonds: energy decomposition analysis (EDA), quantum chemical topology, and molecular orbital (MO) theory. The glue to our theory is the electron energy density, interpretable as one part electrons and one part electronegativity. We present a three&#8208;dimensional analysis of the electron energy density and use it to redefine what constitutes an atom in a molecule. Definitions of atomic partial charge and electronegativity follow in a way that connects these concepts to the total energy of a molecule. The formation of polar bonds is predicted to cause inversion of electronegativity, and a new perspective of bonding in diborane and guanine&#8722;cytosine base&#8208;pairing is presented. The electronegativity of atoms inside molecules is shown to be predictive of pKa.

         <title>Fluorescent Benzothiadiazole Derivatives as Fluorescence Imaging Dyes: A Decade of New Generation Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Go bio! The use of fluorescent benzothiadiazole small molecules as bioimaging probes has been reviewed. After more than a decade since the first application in cell&#8208;imaging experiments, a huge evolution in their utilization has been noted. Still, there is much room for improvements, creative ideas, and advances in the use of these dyes.







Abstract
The current review describes advances in the use of fluorescent 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (BTD) derivatives after nearly one decade since the first description of bioimaging experiments using this class of fluorogenic dyes. The review describes the use of BTD&#8208;containing fluorophores applied as, inter alia, bioprobes for imaging cell nuclei, mitochondria, lipid droplets, sensors, markers for proteins and related events, biological processes and activities, lysosomes, plasma membranes, multicellular models, and animals. A number of physicochemical and photophysical properties commonly observed for BTD fluorogenic structures are also described.

After more than a decade since the first application in cell-imaging experiments, a huge evolution in their utilization has been noted. Still, there is much room for improvements, creative ideas, and advances in the use of these dyes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current review describes advances in the use of fluorescent 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD) derivatives after nearly one decade since the first description of bioimaging experiments using this class of fluorogenic dyes. The review describes the use of BTD-containing fluorophores applied as, inter alia, bioprobes for imaging cell nuclei, mitochondria, lipid droplets, sensors, markers for proteins and related events, biological processes and activities, lysosomes, plasma membranes, multicellular models, and animals. A number of physicochemical and photophysical properties commonly observed for BTD fluorogenic structures are also described.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
The setup for operando measurement of hydrogen evolution under illumination is shown in the cover feature picture. Various cobaloxime catalysts were deposited onto solid support (carbon nanomembranes) and evaluated with respect to their hydrogen evolution reaction by using Pd microsensors. The structure of the most efficient cobalt&#8208;based double salt complex is depicted in the foreground. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M. von&#8197;Delius, C. Kranz, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102778). Photo credit: Elvira Eberhardt, Ulm University.

         <title>Structure and Biosynthesis of Myxofacyclines: Unique Myxobacterial Polyketides Featuring Varying and Rare Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Myxobacteria are not only known for their complex &#8220;social behavior&#8221; including the formation of fruiting bodies, but also for being a prolific source of natural products. We describe the discovery and isolation of the myxofacycline natural product family, which feature either an isoxazole, a 4&#8208;pyrimidinole or a 1,2&#8208;dihydropyrrol&#8208;3&#8208;one heterocycle. Intriguingly, mutagenesis of the producer strain and heterologous expression of the identified biosynthetic genes revealed that all three heterocycles originate from the same biosynthetic pathway, thus suggesting an unique biochemistry to synthesize (secondary) metabolites with exceptional scaffolds and heterocycles. More information can be found in the Full Paper by R. M&#252;ller et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103095).

         <title>Highly Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence from Pyrazine&#8208;Fused Carbene Au(I) Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel gold(I)&#8208;carbene complex shows high efficiency thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and sub&#8208;microsecond emission lifetime. The use of conventional pyrazine&#8208;fused nitrogen&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand as the acceptor provides an alternative molecular design to TADF Au(I) carbene emitters.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;based thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) is conceived to inherit the advantages of both phosphorescent metal complexes and purely organic TADF compounds for high&#8208;performance electroluminescence. Herein a panel of new TADF Au(I) emitters has been designed and synthesized by using carbazole and pyrazine&#8208;fused nitrogen&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) as the donor and acceptor ligands, respectively. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures show linear molecular shape and coplanar arrangement of the donor and acceptor with small dihedral angles of &lt;6.5&#176;. The coplanar orientation and appropriate separation of the HOMO and LUMO in this type of molecules favour the formation of charge&#8208;transfer excited state with appreciable oscillator strength. Together with a minor but essential heavy atom effect of Au ion, the complexes in doped films exhibit highly efficient (&#934;&#8764;0.9) and short&#8208;lived (&lt;1 &#956;s) green emissions via TADF. Computational studies on this class of emitters have been performed to decipher the key reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) pathway. In addition to a small energy splitting between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states (&#916;EST), the spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) effect is found to be larger at a specific torsion angle between the donor and acceptor planes which favours the RISC process the most. This work provides an alternative molecular design to TADF Au(I) carbene emitters for OLED application.

A bipyridine&#8208;modified DNA three&#8208;way junction (3WJ) structure has been synthesized from three DNA strands modified with a bipyridine (bpy) ligand via a stable amide linker. The bpy&#8208;modified 3WJ was thermally stabilized by the formation of an interstrand NiII(bpy)3 complex. Structural induction of the 3WJs and the duplexes was achieved by adding or removing NiII ions. NiII&#8208;mediated self&#8208;sorting of 3WJs was also demonstrated by using the bpy&#8208;modified strands and their unmodified counterparts. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Y. Takezawa, S. Sakakibara, and M. Shionoya (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102977).

         <title>CD Stretching Modes are Sensitive to the Microenvironment in Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Use of perdeuterated surface&#8208;active ionic liquids allows for the in&#8197;situ IR spectroscopic differentiation between alkyl chains exposed to a polar microenvironment of the ions and those agglomerated via van der Waals interactions into nonpolar regions. In the monolayer film, the segregation phenomenon depends on the electrode potential.







Abstract
Knowledge of the structure of the electrical double layer in ionic liquids (IL) is crucial for their applications in electrochemical technologies. We report the synthesis and applicability of an imidazolium&#8208;based amphiphilic ionic liquid with a perdeuterated alkyl chain for studies of electric potential&#8208;dependent rearrangements, and changes in the microenvironment in a monolayer on a Au(111) surface. Electrochemical measurements show two states of the organization of ions on the electrode surface. In situ IR spectroscopy shows that the alkyl chains in imidazolium cations change their orientation depending on the adsorption state. The methylene&#8208;d2 stretching modes in the perdeuterated IL display a reversible, potential&#8208;dependent appearance of a new band. The presence of this mode also depends on the anion in the IL. Supported by quantum chemical calculations, this new mode is assigned to a second &#957;as(CD2) band in alkyl&#8208;chain fragments embedded in a polar environment of the anions/solvent present in the vicinity of the imidazolium cation and electrode. It is a measure of the potential&#8208;dependent segregation between polar and nonpolar environments in the layers of an IL closest to the electrode.

         <title>Shorter Alkyl Chains Enhance Molecular Diffusion and Electron Transfer Kinetics between Photosensitisers and Catalysts in CO2&#8208;Reducing Photocatalytic Liposomes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Ru photosensitisers (RuCn) and Re catalysts (ReCn) covalently functionalised with alkyl chains of different lengths (n=9, 12, 15, 17, and 19) were immobilised on liposomes to perform photocatalytic CO2 reduction using ascorbate (HAsc&#8722;) as electron donor. A higher turnover number for CO production (TONCO) was found for systems with shorter alkyl tails, which was due to the higher mobility of the molecules on the lipid bilayer, leading to faster electron transfer between RuCn and ReCn.







Abstract
Covalent functionalisation with alkyl tails is a common method for supporting molecular catalysts and photosensitisers onto lipid bilayers, but the influence of the alkyl chain length on the photocatalytic performances of the resulting liposomes is not well understood. In this work, we first prepared a series of rhenium&#8208;based CO2&#8208;reduction catalysts [Re(4,4&#8217;&#8208;(CnH2n+1)2&#8208;bpy)(CO)3Cl] (ReCn; 4,4&#8217;&#8208;(CnH2n+1)2&#8208;bpy=4,4&#8217;&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine) and ruthenium&#8208;based photosensitisers [Ru(bpy)2(4,4&#8217;&#8208;(CnH2n+1)2&#8208;bpy)](PF6)2 (RuCn) with different alkyl chain lengths (n=0, 9, 12, 15, 17, and 19). We then prepared a series of PEGylated DPPC liposomes containing RuCn and ReCn, hereafter noted Cn, to perform photocatalytic CO2 reduction in the presence of sodium ascorbate. The photocatalytic performance of the Cn liposomes was found to depend on the alkyl tail length, as the turnover number for CO (TON) was inversely correlated to the alkyl chain length, with a more than fivefold higher CO production (TON=14.5) for the C9 liposomes, compared to C19 (TON=2.8). Based on immobilisation efficiency quantification, diffusion kinetics, and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy, we identified the main reason for this trend: two types of membrane&#8208;bound RuCn species can be found in the membrane, either deeply buried in the bilayer and diffusing slowly, or less buried with much faster diffusion kinetics. Our data suggest that the higher photocatalytic performance of the C9 system is due to the higher fraction of the more mobile and less buried molecular species, which leads to enhanced electron transfer kinetics between RuC9 and ReC9.

In this scaffold, the aniline NH proton is forced into close proximity with the nearby fluorine (  d  H,F  ~2.0 &#197;, &#8736; ~138&#176;), and a through&#8208;space interaction is observed by NMR spectroscopy with couplings (  1h  J  NH,F  ) of 19 &#177; 1 Hz. We used a combination of experimental (NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallography) and theoretical methods (DFT calculations) for the characterization of this weak interaction. In particular, we investigated the effect of conformational rigidity and steric compression on coupling. We used this scaffold for the direct comparison of fluoride (F) with methoxy (OMe) as HB acceptors, and we probed the susceptibility of the NH  &#8230;  F interaction to changes in electron distribution and resonance by preparing a series of molecules with different electron&#8208;donating or &#8208;withdrawing groups in the positions para to the NH and F. Our results support the idea that fluorine can act as a weak HB acceptor, and the HB strength can be modulated via additive and linear electronic substituent effects.</dc:description>

         <title>DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG Adducts of 1,3&#8208;Butadiene: Synthesis, Structural Characterization, and Formation in 1,2,3,4&#8208;Diepoxybutane Treated DNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metabolic activation of the human carcinogen 1,3&#8208;butadiene (BD) by cytochrome 450 monooxygenases gives rise to a genotoxic diepoxide, 1,2,3,4&#8208;diepoxybutane (DEB). This reactive electrophile alkylates guanine bases in DNA to produce N7&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3,4&#8208;epoxy&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;dG (N7&#8208;HEB&#8208;dG) adducts.

Here we report the first synthesis and structural characterization of DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG adducts. Authentic standards of DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG and its  15  N  3  &#8208;labeled analogue were used for the development of a quantitative nanoLC&#8208;ESI  +  &#8208;HRMS/MS method, allowing for adduct detection in DEB&#8208;treated calf thymus DNA. DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG formation in DNA was dependent on DEB concentration and pH, with higher numbers observed under alkaline conditions.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Metabolic activation of the human carcinogen 1,3-butadiene (BD) by cytochrome 450 monooxygenases gives rise to a genotoxic diepoxide, 1,2,3,4-diepoxybutane (DEB). This reactive electrophile alkylates guanine bases in DNA to produce N7-(2-hydroxy-3,4-epoxy-1-yl)-dG (N7-HEB-dG) adducts. Because of the positive charge at the N7 position of the purine heterocycle, N7-HEB-dG adducts are inherently unstable and can undergo spontaneous depurination or base-catalyzed imidazole ring opening to give  N  6  -[2-deoxy-D-  erythro  -pentofuranosyl]-2,6-diamino-3,4-dihydro-4-oxo-5-  N  -1-(oxiran-2-yl)propan-1-ol-formamidopyrimidine (DEB-FAPy-dG) adducts. Here we report the first synthesis and structural characterization of DEB-FAPy-dG adducts. Authentic standards of DEB-FAPy-dG and its  15  N  3  -labeled analogue were used for the development of a quantitative nanoLC-ESI  +  -HRMS/MS method, allowing for adduct detection in DEB-treated calf thymus DNA.

         <title>Chemistry on the complex: derivatization of TiO4N2&#8208;based complexes and application to multi&#8208;step synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemistry on octahedral TiO4N2&#8208;complexes is described. The Ti(IV)&#8208;based precursors are composed of two ligands 6,6&#8217;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;biphenolato (1) and one substituted 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligand (2&#8208;5). The application of imine condensation, palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;C bond formation or copper&#8208;catalysed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition allowed the grafting of various new groups onto these species. In particular Sonogashira reactions permitted to observe an excellent conversion of the starting complexes. This systematic study enabled to compile the factors required to preserve the framework of the complexes in the course of a chemical transformation. Thanks to this chemistry realized on the complex, the Ti(1)2 fragment was used as a protecting group to develop a multi&#8208;step synthesis of a bis&#8208;phenanthroline compound (12), for which the synthesis without this protection failed. Thus, a dinuclear complex [Ti2(1)4(12)] was first prepared starting from complex precursor bearing an acetylenic function via a Hay coupling reaction. This was followed by a deprotection step affording 12. Overall, this work illustrates how the Ti(1)2 fragment could be an useful tool for the preparation of unprecedented diimine compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Merging of a perylene moiety enables a Ru(II) photosensitizer with long&#8208;lived excited states and the efficient production of singlet oxygen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multichromophoric systems based on a Ru(II) polypyridine moiety containing an additional organic chromophore are of increasing interest with respect to different light&#8208;driven applications. Here, we present the synthesis and detailed characterization of a novel Ru(II) photosensitizer, namely [(tbbpy)  2  Ru((2&#8208;(perylen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;  f  ][1,10]&#8208;phenanthrolline))](PF  6  )  2  RuipPer  , that includes a merged perylene dye in the back of the ip ligand. This complex features two emissive excited states as well as a long&#8208;lived dark state (8 &#181;s) in acetonitrile solution. Compared to prototype [(bpy)  3  Ru]  2+  &#8208;like complexes a strongly altered absorption (&#949;&#160;=&#160;50.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10  3  M  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;1  at 467&#160;nm) and emission behavior caused by the introduction of the perylene unit is found. Following a combination of spectroelectrochemistry and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy was used to elucidate the nature of the excited states. Finally, this photosensitizer was successfully used for the efficient formation of reactive singlet oxygen.</dc:description>

         <title>Developing efficient small molecule acceptors with sp2&#8208;hybridized nitrogen at different positions by density functional theory calculations, molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical structure of small molecule acceptors determines their performance in organic solar cells. Multiscale simulations are necessary to avoid trial&#8208;and&#8208;error based design, ultimately to save time and resources. Herein, the effect of sp  2  &#8208;hybridized nitrogen substitution at the inner or the outmost position of central core, side chain, and terminal group of small molecule acceptors is investigated using multiscale computational modelling. Quantum chemical analysis is used to study the electronic behavior. Nitrogen substitution at end&#8208;capping has significantly decreased the electron&#8208;reorganization energy. No big change is observed in transfer integral and excited state behavior. However, nitrogen substitution at terminal group position is good way to improve electron&#8208;mobility. Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of newly designed acceptors is predicted using machine learning. Molecular dynamics simulations are also performed to explore the dynamics of acceptor and their blends with PBDB&#8208;T polymer donor. Florgy&#8208;Huggins parameter is calculated to study the mixing of designed small molecule acceptors with PBDB&#8208;T. Radial distribution function has indicated that PBDB&#8208;T has showed a closer packing with N3 and N4. From all analysis, it is found that nitrogen substitution at end&#8208;capping group is a better strategy to design efficient small molecule acceptors.</dc:description>

         <title>Joint Venture of Metal Cluster and Amphiphilic Cationic Minidendron Resulting in NIR Emissive Lamellar Ionic Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inorganic red&#8208;NIR emissive materials are particularly relevant in many fields like optoelectronic, bioimaging or solar cells. Benefiting from their emission in devices implies their integration in easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle materials like liquid crystals, whose long&#8208;range ordering and self&#8208;healing abilities could be exploited and influence emission. Herein, we present red&#8208;NIR emissive hybrid materials obtained with phosphorescent octahedral molybdenum cluster anions electrostatically associated with amphiphilic guanidinium minidendrons. Polarized optical microscopy and X&#8208;ray analysis show that while the minidendron chloride salts self&#8208;organize into columnar phases, their association with the dianionic metal cluster leads to layered phases. Steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved emission investigations demonstrate the influence of the minidendron alkyl chain length on the phosphorescence of the metal cluster core.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidating the Supramolecular Copolymerization of N&#8208; and C&#8208;Centered Benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;Tricarboxamides: The Role of Parallel and Antiparallel Packing of Amide Groups in the copolymer microstructure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An in&#8208;depth study of the supramolecular copolymerization behavior of N&#8208; and C&#8208;centered benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamides (N&#8208; and C&#8208;BTAs) is conducted in methylcyclohexane and in the solid state. The connectivity of the amide groups in the BTAs differs, and mixing N&#8208; and C&#8208;BTAs results in supramolecular copolymers with a blocky microstructure in solution. The blocky microstructure results from the formation of weaker and less organized, antiparallel hydrogen bonds between N&#8208; and C&#8208;BTAs. In methylcyclohexane, the helical threefold hydrogen&#8208;bonding network present in C&#8208; and N&#8208;BTAs is retained in the mixtures. In the solid state, in contrast, the hydrogen bonds of pure BTAs as well as their mixtures organize in a sheet&#8208;like pattern, and in the mixtures long&#8208;range order is lost. Drop&#8208;casting to kinetically trap the solution microstructures shows that C&#8208;BTAs retain the helical hydrogen bonds, but N&#8208;BTAs immediately adopt the sheet&#8208;like pattern, a direct consequence of the lower stabilization energy of the helical hydrogen bonds. In the copolymers, the stability of the helical aggregates depends on the copolymer composition, and helical aggregates are only preserved when a high amount of C&#8208;BTAs is present. The method outlined here is generally applicable to elucidate copolymerization behavior of supramolecular monomers both in solution as well as in the solid state.</dc:description>

         <title>Pivotal Role of Holes in Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction on TiO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Evidence is provided that in a gas&#8208;solid photocatalytic reaction the removal of photogenerated holes from a titania (TiO  2  ) photocatalyst is always detrimental for photocatalytic CO  2  reduction. The coupling of the reaction to a sacrificial oxidation reaction hinders or entirely prohibits the formation of CH  4  as a reduction product. This agrees with earlier work in which the detrimental effect of oxygen&#8208;evolving cocatalysts was demonstrated. Photocatalytic alcohol oxidation or even overall water splitting proceeds in these reaction systems, but carbon&#8208;containing products from CO  2  reduction are no longer observed. H  2  addition is also detrimental, either because it scavenges holes or because it is not an efficient proton donor on TiO  2  . The results are discussed in light of previously suggested reaction mechanisms for photocatalytic CO  2  reduction. The formation of CH  4  from CO  2  is likely not a linear sequence of reduction steps but includes oxidative elementary steps. Furthermore, new hypotheses on the origin of the required protons are suggested.</dc:description>

         <title>Imidazolyl&#8208;phenylcarbazole&#8208;based Host Materials and Their Use for Co&#8208;host Designs in Phosphorescent OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, owing to the demand for high&#8208;efficiency phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting devices (PhOLEDs), many studies have been conducted on the development of bipolar host materials. A series of imidazolyl&#8208;phenylcarbazole&#8208;based host materials,  i.e.  ,  im&#8208;CzP  ,  im&#8208;CzPCz  ,  im&#8208;CzP  t  Bu  , and  im&#8208;OCzP  , were synthesized to obtain high&#8208;efficiency green and red&#8208;emitting PhOLEDs. With  im&#8208;OCzP  as the host, satisfactory peak efficiencies of 22.2 (77.0 cd A  &#8208;1  and 93.1 lm W  &#8208;1  ) and 14.1% (9.0 cd A  &#8208;1  and 10.1 lm W  &#8208;1  ) could be obtained, respectively. To further improve the performance of the devices, an electron transport material, bis&#8208;4,6&#8208;(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;3&#8208;pyridylphenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;methylpyrimidine (B3PyMPM) was selected to construct a co&#8208;hosted system. The efficiency of  im&#8208;OCzP  combined with B3PyMPM forming co&#8208;hosts could also achieve high values of 23.0 (80.0 cd A  &#8208;1  and 98.8 lm W  &#8208;1  ) and 16.5% (10.2 cd A  &#8208;1  and 13.4 lm W  &#8208;1  ) for green and red PhOLEDs, respectively. These results exhibited that the proposed bipolar hosts have great flexibility in adjusting the carrier balance of EML in OLEDs, demonstrating their ingenious design and high potential.</dc:description>

         <title>A Copper(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Sulfonylative Hiyama Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct synthesis of diaryl sulfones from aryl silanes, SO2 surrogate, and aryl iodides is performed thanks to an air&#8208;stable Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylative Hiyama cross&#8208;coupling. Experimental and theoretical studies support a Cu(I)/Cu(III)&#8208;based mechanism with fast insertion of the small molecule into the Cu&#8722;C bond of a copper&#8208;aryl intermediate.







Abstract
An air&#8208;tolerant Cu&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylative Hiyama cross&#8208;coupling reaction enabling the formation of diaryl sulfones is described. Starting from aryl silanes, DABSO and aryliodides, the reaction tolerates a large variety of polar functional groups (amines, ketones, esters, aldehydes). Control experiments coupled with DFT calculations shed light on the mechanism, characterized by the formation of a Cu(I)&#8208;sulfinate intermediate via fast insertion of a SO2 molecule.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Heck&#8208;Type Reactions of Allenes for Stereoselective Syntheses of Substituted 1,3&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stereoselective synthesis of (Z,E)&#8208;dienes from allenes is described. The method employs a Heck&#8208;type reaction catalyzed by tris(dibenzylideneacetone) dipalladium, Pd2dba3 and a CyJohnPhos ligand and does not require a leaving or directing group on the allene. The stereochemistry of both olefins of the diene is set simultaneously using both A1,3 strain and eclipsing interactions during the &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination to give (Z,E)&#8201;:&#8201;(E,E) dienes in good selectivity. The method also provides regiocontrolled access to 2,4&#8208;dienoates and dienamides.







Abstract
A highly stereoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed Heck&#8208;type reaction of allenes in which the stereochemistry of both olefins is set simultaneously was developed. The ligand CyJohnPhos was crucial to achieving stereoselectivity, while minimizing isomerization of the starting material through hydropalladation. The stereodetermining factors were proposed to be A1,3 strain between the catalyst and allene substituent, which influences the &#963;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;&#963; equilibrium of the coupled allene intermediate, as well as eclipsing interactions of R groups in the &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination. Good functional group tolerance and stereoselectivities for formation of the Z,E isomer were demonstrated. The methodology was further expanded to include the regioselective formation of 2,4&#8208;dienoates and 2,4&#8208;dienamides with a variety of substitution patterns, albeit in reduced stereoselectivities favoring the E,E isomer. A plausible mechanism is proposed to account for the observed selectivities and substituent effects.

         <title>Synthesis of Benzoisoselenazolones via Rh(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Annulative Selenation by Using Elemental Selenium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed direct selenium annulation by using stable and tractable elemental selenium is developed. A series of benzamides as well as acrylamides were successfully coupled with selenium under mild reaction conditions to give isoselenazolone derivatives. An unprecedented selenation mechanism involving an electrophilic Se(IV) species as the reactive selenium donor is proposed based on the designed control experiments, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, and computational study.







Abstract
Isoselenazolone derivatives have attracted significant research interest because of their potent therapeutic activities and indispensable applications in organic synthesis. Efficient construction of functionalized isoselenazolone scaffolds is still challenging, and thus new synthetic approaches with improved operational simplicity have been of particular interest. In this manuscript, we introduce a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed direct selenium annulation by using stable and tractable elemental selenium. A series of benzamides as well as acrylamides were successfully coupled with selenium under mild reaction conditions, and the obtained isoselenazolones could be pivotal synthetic precursors for several organoselenium compounds. Based on the designed control experiments and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy measurements, we propose an unprecedented selenation mechanism involving a highly electrophilic Se(IV) species as the reactive selenium donor. The reaction mechanism was further verified by a computational study.

         <title>Variable Luminescence and Chromaticity of Homoleptic Frameworks of the Lanthanides together with Pyridylpyrazolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
White&#8208;light emission can be achieved, according to the RGB concept, by deliberate mixing of different trivalent Ln3+ ions in homoleptic Ln&#8208;coordination polymers. Thereby, single&#8208;color emitters can be tuned to an additive chromaticity of red (Eu3+), green (Tb3+), and blue (backbone) to give white light. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. M&#252;ller&#8208;Buschbaum et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103068).

         <title>Multifunctional Polyoxometalate Platforms for Supramolecular Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Evolution**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular visible light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution by a covalently linked POM/Pt&#8208;complex is reported. Electrostatic interactions in solution between the anionic POM and a cationic Ir&#8208;based photosensitizer are utilized to enable electron&#8208;transfer and H2 evolution. Reactivity enhancement by ligand exchange on the Pt&#8208;complex is possible. Photophysical and theoretical studies shed light on the underlying reaction mechanisms.







Abstract
Multifunctional supramolecular systems are a central research topic in light&#8208;driven solar energy conversion. Here, we report a polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based supramolecular dyad, where two platinum&#8208;complex hydrogen evolution catalysts are covalently anchored to an Anderson polyoxomolybdate anion. Supramolecular electrostatic coupling of the system to an iridium photosensitizer enables visible light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution. Combined theory and experiment demonstrate the multifunctionality of the POM, which acts as photosensitizer/catalyst&#8208;binding&#8208;site[1] and facilitates light&#8208;induced charge&#8208;transfer and catalytic turnover. Chemical modification of the Pt&#8208;catalyst site leads to increased hydrogen evolution reactivity. Mechanistic studies shed light on the role of the individual components and provide a molecular understanding of the interactions which govern stability and reactivity. The system could serve as a blueprint for multifunctional polyoxometalates in energy conversion and storage.

         <title>Synthesis, structures, and properties of helically fused anthraquinones with unusually close carbonyl&#8211;carbonyl contacts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron&#8208;deficient aromatic ketones consisting of three fused anthraquinone units were synthesized by oxidation of the corresponding fused anthracenes. X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that these compounds had nonplanar helical structures with unusual contacts, C=O&#183;&#183;&#183;C=O 2.467 &#197;, between the inner carbonyl groups. The role of n&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;* interactions in the short contacts was evaluated using a noncovalent interaction plot and natural bond orbital analysis. The dynamic process involving helical inversion was observed by the variable temperature  1  H NMR measurement of a derivative with 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl groups, and the barrier was estimated to be 77 kJ mol  &#8211;1  . DFT calculations indicated that the helical inversion proceeded via a multistep mechanism. The characteristic spectroscopic and electrochemical data due to the electron&#8208;deficient anthraquinone units and the sterically congested carbonyl groups are discussed with the aid of DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Synchronicity of Molecular Valence Tautomerism with Macroscopic Solid&#8211;Liquid Transition by Molecular Lattice Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Changing the length of the side chains in a series of cobalt complexes changed the melting temperature and allowed the synchronicity of the valence tautomerism and solid&#8211;liquid transition to be controlled. The three complexes exhibit distinct macroscopic transitions from the crystalline phase to violet, blueish, or green liquids; this is represented in the figure by the degree of hand&#8208;holding between the two children jumping in the lavender field. More information can be found in the Full Paper by H.&#8208;C. Chang et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103090).

Switching site&#8208;selectivity: Regiodivergent Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;positions of the alkyl side&#8208;chain of heteroaromatic ketones is reported. The presence of a pyridone ligand orients the selectivity towards &#946;&#8208;arylation, while its absence leads to &#945;&#8208;arylation. Mechanistic studies suggest that &#945;&#8208;arylation follows a C&#8722;H activation pathway, whereas &#946;&#8208;arylation takes place through a C&#8722;H activation/desaturation/conjugate addition manifold. The method developed is mild and allows further functionalization of the products.







Abstract
A ligand&#8208;controlled site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation of heteroaromatic ketones has been developed using Pd catalysis. The reaction occurred selectively at the &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;position of the ketone side&#8208;chain. The switch from &#945;&#8208; to &#946;&#8208;arylation was realized by addition of a pyridone ligand. The &#945;&#8208;arylation process showed broad scope and high site&#8208; and chemoselectivity, whereas the &#946;&#8208;arylation was more limited. Mechanistic investigations suggested that &#945;&#8208;arylation occurs through C&#8722;H activation/oxidative addition/reductive elimination whereas &#946;&#8208;arylation involves desaturation and aryl insertion.

A dimethyldihydropyrene photochromic system substituted by donor and acceptor units (left) is presented by M. Boggio&#8208;Pasqua, G. Royal, and co&#8208;workers in their Full Paper (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103003). Such chemical functionalization allows an efficient photo&#8208;isomerization of the compound to its corresponding cyclophanediene isomer (center) when irradiated with red light. This photochrome can also play the role of oxygen photosensitizer and is able to reversibly trap singlet oxygen in the form of endoperoxide derivatives (right) when illuminated at room temperature under aerobic conditions.

         <title>Cyclodimers and Cyclotrimers of 2,3&#8201;&#8208;Bisalkynylated Anthracenes, Phenazines and Diazatetracenes</title>

         <dc:description>
Cyclodimers and cyclotrimers of 2,3&#8208;bisalkynylated anthracenes, phenanzines and diazatetracenes were synthesized through Glaser coupling. They display comparable optoelectronic properties but differ dramatically with respect to their solid&#8208;state packing. Intermolecular interactions are fundamental for charge transfer in thin film transistors, and the diazatetracene trimer exhibits charge transfer mobilities an order of magnitude higher than its dimeric congener.

         <title>Strong Ligand Stabilization Based on &#960;&#8208;Extension in a Series of Ruthenium Terpyridine Water Oxidation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The correlation between the stability of a monodentate chloride ligand and the catalytic water oxidation performance of a set of ruthenium(II) terpyridine complexes based on &#960;&#8208;extension of a bipyridine is investigated. The findings are supported by theoretical calculations and show a significant dependence of the stability of the chloride ligand on the &#960;&#8208;extension and, hence, a decrease in the catalytic turnover number and turnover frequency.







Abstract
The substitution behavior of the monodentate Cl ligand of a series of ruthenium(II) terpyridine complexes (terpyridine (tpy)=2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine) has been investigated. 1H&#8197;NMR kinetic experiments of the dissociation of the chloro ligand in D2O for the complexes [Ru(tpy)(bpy)Cl]Cl (1, bpy=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine) and [Ru(tpy)(dppz)Cl]Cl (2, dppz=dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine) as well as the binuclear complex [Ru(bpy)2(tpphz)Ru(tpy)Cl]Cl3 (3&#8201;b, tpphz=tetrapyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c:3&#8242;&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;h:2&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;j]phenazine) were conducted, showing increased stability of the chloride ligand for compounds 2 and 3 due to the extended &#960;&#8208;system. Compounds 1&#8211;5 (4=[Ru(tbbpy)2(tpphz)Ru(tpy)Cl](PF6)3, 5=[Ru(bpy)2(tpphz)Ru(tpy)(C3H8OS)/(H2O)](PF6)3, tbbpy=4,4&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine) are tested for their ability to run water oxidation catalysis (WOC) using cerium(IV) as sacrificial oxidant. The WOC experiments suggest that the stability of monodentate (chloride) ligand strongly correlates to catalytic performance, which follows the trend 1&gt;2&gt;5&#8805;3&gt;4. This is also substantiated by quantum chemical calculations, which indicate a stronger binding for the chloride ligand based on the extended &#960;&#8208;systems in compounds 2 and 3. Additionally, a theoretical model of the mechanism of the oxygen evolution of compounds 1 and 2 is presented; this suggests no differences in the elementary steps of the catalytic cycle within the bpy to the dppz complex, thus suggesting that differences in the catalytic performance are indeed based on ligand stability. Due to the presence of a photosensitizer and a catalytic unit, binuclear complexes 3 and 4 were tested for photocatalytic water oxidation. The bridging ligand architecture, however, inhibits the effective electron&#8208;transfer cascade that would allow photocatalysis to run efficiently. The findings of this study can elucidate critical factors in catalyst design.

         <title>Tuning Ruthenium Carbene Complexes for Selective P&#8722;H Activation through Metal&#8208;Ligand Cooperation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal ligand cooperation. Two different iminophosphoryl&#8208;substituted methandiide&#8208;derived carbene complexes have been applied in the P&#8722;H bond activation of secondary phosphines. Surprisingly versatile reaction outcomes were observed depending on the imine substituent at the methandiide ligand and the phosphine used. While more&#8208;electron&#8208;rich combinations led to either cyclometallation or an imine transfer, electron&#8208;poor combinations enabled selective P&#8722;H bond activation, thus impressively demonstrating the importance of tuning the M=C in this type of carbene complex for bond activation.







Abstract
The use of iminophosphoryl&#8208;tethered ruthenium carbene complexes to activate secondary phosphine P&#8722;H bonds is reported. Complexes of type [(p&#8208;cymene)&#8208;RuC(SO2Ph)(PPh2NR)] (with R = SiMe3 or 4&#8208;C6H4&#8722;NO2) were found to exhibit different reactivities depending on the electronics of the applied phosphine and the substituent at the iminophosphoryl moiety. Hence, the electron&#8208;rich silyl&#8208;substituted complex undergoes cyclometallation or shift of the imine moiety after cooperative activation of the P&#8722;H bond across the M=C linkage, depending on the electronics of the applied phosphine. Deuteration experiments and computational studies proved that cyclometallation is initiated by the activation process at the M=C bond and triggered by the high electron density at the metal in the phosphido intermediates. Consistently, replacement of the trimethylsilyl (TMS) group by the electron&#8208;withdrawing 4&#8208;nitrophenyl substituent allowed the selective cooperative P&#8722;H activation to form stable activation products.

         <title>Photochemical Hydrogen Evolution at Metal Centers Probed with Hydrated Aluminium Cations, Al+(H2O)n, n=1&#8211;10</title>

More complex than expected: Photochemical hydrogen evolution in Al+(H2O)n involves conical intersections, multiple intersystem crossings between singlet and triplet surfaces, and electron transfer. Three neutral photoproducts are observed&#8212;hydrogen atoms, hydrogen molecules, and water. For the Al+(H2O)2 cluster, we show how a hydrogen radical is ejected and dictates reactivity. Our results underline the multitude of pathways in photochemistry of these seemingly simple ions. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M. On&#269;&#225;k, M.&#8197;K. Beyer et&#8197;al.

         <title>Probing the Boundaries between Lewis&#8208;Basic and Redox Behavior of a Parent Borylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrophile or nucleophile: A cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene&#8208; and PMe3&#8208;stabilized parent borylene acts both as a Lewis base and reducing agent towards group 13 trihalides (EX3, E=B, Al, Ga, In, X=F, Cl, Br, I), yielding borylene&#8208;EX3 adducts and the boryl radical cation. Halide abstraction converts the borylene&#8208;BX3 adducts to the unsymmetrical borylboronium species. Computations probe the bond dissociation energy and electronic nature of the B&#8211;E bonds in the Lewis adducts.







Abstract
The parent borylene (CAAC)(Me3P)BH, 1 (CAAC=cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene), acts both as a Lewis base and one&#8208;electron reducing agent towards group 13 trichlorides (ECl3, E=B, Al, Ga, In), yielding the adducts 1&#8208;ECl3 and increasing proportions of the radical cation [1]&#8226;+ for the heavier group 13 analogues. With boron trihalides (BX3, X=F, Cl, Br, I) 1 undergoes sequential adduct formation and halide abstraction reactions to yield borylboronium cations and shows an increasing tendency towards redox processes for the heavier halides. Calculations confirm that 1 acts as a strong Lewis base towards EX3 and show a marked increase in the B&#8722;E bond dissociation energies down both group 13 and the halide group.

         <title>Negishi Cross&#8208;Coupling Provides Alkylated Tryptophans and Tryptophan Regioisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;canonical amino acids. The portfolio of possible late&#8208;stage derivatisations of biocatalytically halogenated tryptophan has been expanded by Palladium&#8208;catalysed Negishi cross coupling for a direct alkylation of bromotryptophan and the synthesis of tryptophan regioisomers from bromoindole derivatives.







Abstract
Mild transition&#8208;metal catalysed cross&#8208;couplings enable direct functionalisation of biocatalytically halogenated tryptophans with alkyl iodides, representing a new alternative for late&#8208;stage derivatisations of halogenated aromatic amino acids. Moreover, this strategy enables preparation of (homo)tryptophan regioisomers in a simple two&#8208;step synthesis using a Pd&#8208;catalysed Negishi cross coupling. This method provides access to non&#8208;canonical constitutional surrogates of tryptophan, ready for use in peptide synthesis.

         <title>Enhancing the Catalytic Activity of MOF&#8208;808 Towards Peptide Bond Hydrolysis through Synthetic Modulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The performance of MOFs in catalysis is largely derived from structural features, and much work has focused on introducing structural changes such as defects or ligand functionalisation to boost the reactivity of the MOF. However, the effects of different parameters chosen for the synthesis on the catalytic reactivity of the resulting MOF remains poorly understood. Here, we evaluate the role of metal precursor on the reactivity of Zr&#8208;based MOF&#8208;808 towards the hydrolysis of the peptide bond in the glycylglycine model substrate. In addition, the effect of synthesis temperature and duration has been also investigated. Surprisingly, the metal precursor was found to have a large influence on the reactivity of the MOF, surpassing the effect of particle size or number of defects. Additionally, we show that by careful selection of the Zr&#8208;salt precursor and temperature used in MOF syntheses equally active MOF catalysts could be obtained after a 20 minute synthesis compared to 24 h synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Perfluoroaryl and perfluoroheteroaryl reagents as emerging new tools for peptide synthesis, modification and bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptides and proteins are becoming increasingly valuable as medicines, diagnostic agents and as tools for biomedical sciences. Much of this has been underpinned by the emergence of new methods for the manipulation and augmentation of native biomolecules. Perfluoroaromatic reagents are perhaps one of the most diverse and exciting tools with which to modify peptides and proteins, due principally to their nucleophilic substitution chemistry, high electron deficiency and the ability for their reactivity to be tuned towards specific nucleophiles. As discussed in this minireview, in recent years, perfluoroaromatic reagents have found applications as protecting groups or activating groups in peptide synthesis and as orthogonal handles for peptide modification.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Peptides and proteins are becoming increasingly valuable as medicines, diagnostic agents and as tools for biomedical sciences. Much of this has been underpinned by the emergence of new methods for the manipulation and augmentation of native biomolecules. Perfluoroaromatic reagents are perhaps one of the most diverse and exciting tools with which to modify peptides and proteins, due principally to their nucleophilic substitution chemistry, high electron deficiency and the ability for their reactivity to be tuned towards specific nucleophiles. As discussed in this minireview, in recent years, perfluoroaromatic reagents have found applications as protecting groups or activating groups in peptide synthesis and as orthogonal handles for peptide modification. Furthermore, they have applications in chemoselective &#8216;tagging&#8217;, stapling and bioconjugation of peptides and proteins, as well as tuning of &#8216;drug-like&#8217; properties. This review will also explore possible future applications of these reagents in biological chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coupling of photoactive transition metal complexes to a functional polymer matrix</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conductive polymers represent a promising alternative to semiconducting oxide electrodes typically used in dye&#8208;sensitized cathodes as they more easily allow a tuning of the physicochemical properties. This can then also be very beneficial for using them in light&#8208;driven catalysis. In this computational study, we address the coupling of Ru&#8208;based photosensitizers to a polymer matrix by combining two different first&#8208;principles electronic structure approaches. We use a periodic density functional theory code to properly account for the delocalized nature of the electronic states in the polymer. These ground state investigations are complemented by time&#8208;dependent density functional theory simulations to assess the Franck&#8208;Condon photophysics of the present photoactive hybrid material based on a molecular model system. Our results are consistent with recent experimental observations and allow to elucidate the light&#8208;driven redox chemical processes &#8211; eventually leading to charge separation &#8211; in the present functional hybrid systems with potential application as photocathode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Scissors for Tailor&#8208;Made Modification of Siloxane Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The controlled design of functional oligosiloxanes is an important topic in current research. A consecutive Si&#8211;O&#8211;Si bond cleavage/formation using siloxanes that are substituted with 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzene derivatives acting as molecular scissors is presented. The method allows to cut at certain positions of a siloxane scaffold forming a cyclic diaminosilane or &#8208;siloxane intermediate and then to introduce new functional siloxy units. The procedure could be extended to a direct one&#8208;step cleavage of chlorooligosiloxanes. Both siloxane formation and cleavage proceed with good to excellent yields, high regioselectivity, and great variability of the siloxy units. Control of the selectivity is achieved by the choice of the amino substituent. Insight into the mechanism was provided by low temperature NMR studies and the isolation of a lithiated intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Supra&#8208;LUMO Interaction: Case Study of a Sudden Change of Electronic Structure as a Functional Emergence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synergistic functioning of redox&#8208;active components that emerges from prototypical 2,2'&#8208;di(  N  &#8208;methylpyrid&#8208;4&#8208;ylium)&#8208;1,1'&#8208;biphenyl is described. Interestingly, even if a&#160;  trans  conformation of the native assembly is expected, due to electrostatic repulsion between cationic pyridinium units, we demonstrate that&#160;  cis  conformation is equally energy&#8208;stabilized on account of a peculiar LUMO (SupLUMO) that develops through space, encompassing the two pyridiniums in a single, made&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8208;piece, electronic entity (superelectrophoric behavior). This SupLUMO emergence originates in a sudden change of electronic structure. This finding is substantiated by solid state (single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction) and solution (NOE&#8208;NMR and UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR spectroelectrochemistry) studies, combined with electronic structure computations. Electrochemistry shows that electron transfers are so strongly correlated that two&#8208;electron reduction manifests itself as a single&#8208;step process with a large potential inversion consistent with inner creation of a carbon&#8208;carbon bond (digital simulation). The redox&#8208;gated covalent bond, serving as electron reservoir, was studied via atropisomerism of the reduction product (VT&#8208;NMR).&#160;  Trans  and&#160;  cis  native species are worth considered as intrinsically different, that is, as doubly&#8208;electrophoric and singly&#8208;superelectrophoric assemblies, beyond conformational isomerism. Importantly, the through&#8208;space&#8208;mediated SupLUMO may come in complement of other weak interactions encountered in Supramolecular Chemistry as a tool for the design of electroactive architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Acid&#8208;Tolerant Sulfate Tetrahedral Cages from Anion&#8208;Coordination&#8208;Driven Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C3&#8208;symmetric tris&#8208;bis(urea) ligands L2 and L3 assemble with sulfate anions to give the first A4L4&#8208;type sulfate tetrahedral cages. The existence of A4L4 cages in solution is sensitive to the stoichiometry of the sulfate and internal guest; they can transform to A3L2 and A3L1 with increasing amounts of sulfate anion. Most noticeably, the A4L4 cages exhibit greater resistance to both Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acids than the corresponding phosphate cages.

Supramolecular cages have been constructed by anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven assembly (ACDA) in recent years and have shown unique host&#8208;guest interactions. However, most of the reported cages are made of the phosphate ion (PO43&#8722;); other anions have rarely been explored. Here we show for the first time that the sulfate ion (SO42&#8722;) is also able to form the A4L4 tetrahedral motif with tris&#8208;bis(urea) ligands, but this is dependent on the stoichiometry of the sulfate ion (in solution). Notably, the sulfate cages display enhanced resistance for both Br&#248;nsted (pH as low as 4.3 in acetone containing 15&#8201;% water) and Lewis acids (metal complexes) compared to the corresponding phosphate cages, and thus could find applications where an acidic (proton or metals) environment is required.

         <title>Synergy of Iron Doping and Cyano Groups for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production over C3N4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe doping improves the absorption of visible light and the conductivity of the material, and promotes the dissociation of excitons, thereby improving the photocatalytic activity. The internal donor&#8208;acceptor system formed by cyano groups and Fe&#8208;doped sites enhanced charge carrier separation and inhibited the radiation recombination of e&#8722;&#8208;h+ pairs. The porous structure provides a higher specific surface area and pore structure, which provides a large number of active sites for the photocatalytic reaction.







Abstract
Improving the insufficient carrier separation dynamics is still of significance in carbon nitride (C3N4) research. Extensive research has been devoted to improving the carrier separation efficiency through a single strategy, while ignoring the synergistic enhancement effect produced by coupling two or more conventional strategies. Herein, we reported the fabrication of cyano group&#8208;containing Fe&#8208;doped C3N4 porous materials via direct co&#8208;calcination of iron acetylacetonate and melamine for synergistically improving the photocatalytic performance. Iron acetylacetonate can promote the generation of cyano groups and form Fe&#8208;doping in C3N4, thereby increasing the visible&#8208;light absorption and reactive sites. Further, the internal donor&#8208;acceptor system formed by cyano groups and Fe&#8208;doped sites promoted charge carrier separation and inhibited the radiation recombination of e&#8722;&#8208;h+ pairs. The optimized photocatalytic activity of Fe&#8722;CN&#8208;2 sample was 4.5 times of bulk C3N4 (BCN).

Rhodium&#8208;electrocatalyzed C&#8722;H alkylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes has been established by using sustainable and eco&#8208;friendly electrocatalytic approaches. As a result, several arenes, including biologically relevant purines, diazepam, and amino acids were selectively methylated. Finally, an example of an unprecedented, paired electrolysis approach leading to ethylated and propylated arenes was also discovered.







Abstract
The use of electricity over traditional stoichiometric oxidants is a promising strategy for sustainable molecular assembly. Herein, we describe the rhoda&#8208;electrocatalyzed C&#8722;H activation/alkylation of several N&#8208;heteroarenes. This catalytic approach has been successfully applied to several arenes, including biologically relevant purines, diazepam, and amino acids. The versatile C&#8722;H alkylation featured water as a co&#8208;solvent and user&#8208;friendly trifluoroborates as alkylating agents. Finally, the rhoda&#8208;electrocatalysis with unsaturated organotrifluoroborates proceeded by paired electrolysis.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,7&#8208;Di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;substituted aza&#8208;BODIPYs (tBu&#8208;azaBDPs) were successfully prepared for the first time. Although the low&#8208;barrier rotation of the distal &#8208;tBu groups in tBu&#8208;azaBDPs results in low quantum yield, photothermal conversion efficiency and single oxygen generation ability of tBu&#8208;azaBDPs are effective than those of Ph&#8208;azaBDP, which is highly desirable for a photothermal&#8208;photodynamic therapy agent.







Abstract
1,7&#8208;Di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;substituted aza&#8208;BODIPYs (tBu&#8208;azaBDP) were successfully obtained for the first time. The structures of tBu&#8208;azaBDP and Ph&#8208;azaBDP were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystal analysis, and tBu&#8208;azaBDP 2 is more twisted than Ph&#8208;azaBDP 5. tBu&#8208;azaBDPs have significant photo&#8208;stability and enhanced water solubility. tBu&#8208;azaBDPs possess excellent optical properties, such as high molar extinction coefficients, broad full width half maxima, and large Stokes shifts, which is comparable to those of the parent dye Ph&#8208;azaBDP. Although the low&#8208;barrier rotation of the distal &#8208;tBu groups in tBu&#8208;azaBDPs results in low quantum yield, photothermal conversion efficiency and singlet oxygen generation ability of tBu&#8208;azaBDPs are more effective than those of Ph&#8208;azaBDP, which is highly desirable for a photothermal&#8208;photodynamic therapy agent.

         <title>Domino Dehydrative &#960;&#8208;Extension: A Facile Path to Extended Perylenes and Terrylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards nanographenes: Domino&#8208;DPEX (dehydrative &#960;&#8208;extension) is a new synthetic approach to extended nanographenes containing a perylene or terrylene core. The pronounced regioselctivity towards aldehyde groups in different positions makes DPEX an excellent tool for implementing pre&#8208;programmed multiple annulation of simple precursors of elusive nanographenes. This approach enables the formation of up to five C&#8722;C bonds in one&#8208;step in up to 94&#8201;% per C&#8722;C bond.







Abstract
Herein, we report a new method for synthesis of extended perylenes and terrylenes. The technique is based on the cascade dehydrative &#960;&#8208;extensions (DPEX) of aryl aldehydes, in which stepwise annulations activate previously &#8220;dormant&#8221; substituents. Two&#8208; and fourfold cyclizations of 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;dicarbaldehydes offer a rapid path to unsymmetrical perylenes and elusive terrylene derivatives, respectively. DPEX of 3,3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(phenanthrene&#8208;1,8&#8208;diyl)bis (([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;dicarbaldehyde)) leads to the biradical structure, which proceeds in&#8197;situ into oxidative electrocyclization at room temperature. The described domino process complements and expands DPEX approach to a large family of fused acenes and related PAHs.

         <title>Multiple Regulation Effects of Ammonium Acetate on ZnO Growth Process in Chemical Bath Deposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The final morphology of ZnO generally involves nucleation, Ostwald ripening and self&#8208;assembly process. Herein, the nucleation experienced the Zn2+&#8208;layered basic zinc salts (LBZs)&#8208;ZnO process, while the self&#8208;assembled unit changed from urchin&#8208;shaped to rod&#8208;shaped and gradually a fully coupled twin&#8208;shaped structure with the increasing concentration of ammonium acetate. The whole growth process clarifies the roles of ammonium acetate in the growth mechanism of ZnO, which may further benefit the optimal synthesis of functional structures.







Abstract
Chemical bath deposition method has been used to synthesize a variety of ZnO morphology structures. However, the specificity and interaction of acetate and ammonium ions with ZnO crystal during the growth process remain elusive. This study contributes to understand the roles of ammonium acetate on the growth mechanism of ZnO in Zn(NO3)2&#8208;HMTA system. The growth process indicates that the nucleation experienced Zn2+&#8208;layered basic zinc salts (LBZs)&#8208;ZnO process, while the self&#8208;assembled unit changed from urchin&#8208;shaped, rod&#8208;shaped to a fully coupled twin&#8208;shaped structure with increasing ammonium acetate concentration. Ammonium acetate dominates the growth process by combing the ligand&#8208;ligand interaction of acetate ions binding to the same Zn&#8208;rich (0001) polar surface and ammonium ions regulating hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) hydrolysis. Relatively regular hexagonal wurtzite structure and a dissolve&#8208;renucleation&#8208;regrowth process which retains the twin&#8208;shaped template and renucleates at the same position are observed at &#8764;10&#8197;mM ammonium acetate. Photoelectrochemistry (PEC) measurements show that the uniform hexagonal ZnO rods (Y&#8208;10, the sample named as Y&#8208;x (x represents x mM ammonium acetate, herein, x is 10&#8197;mM)) have a maximum photocurrent density of 1.54&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;V (vs. RHE), much higher than that of the dumbbell&#8208;shaped ZnO rods (Y&#8208;50, 0.20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at the same voltage. These results provide a further explanation of morphology regulation mechanisms on ZnO synthesis processes and pave the road for more practical applications.

         <title>Tubular Structures of Calcium Carbonate: Formation, Characterization, and Implications in Natural Mineral Environments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium carbonate chemical gardens are tubular mineral structures precipitated upon the addition of sodium carbonate solution to calcium chloride pellets. The tubes are composed of texturally distinct bilayers of aggregates of rhombohedral and cone&#8208;shaped calcite on their exterior and interior surfaces, respectively. These highly crystalline and dense bilayers prohibit the development of significant electrochemical potential differences across the tube walls. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M.

     alt="Tubular Structures of Calcium Carbonate: Formation, Characterization, and Implications in Natural Mineral Environments"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Calcium carbonate chemical gardens&lt;/b&gt; are tubular mineral structures precipitated upon the addition of sodium carbonate solution to calcium chloride pellets. The tubes are composed of texturally distinct bilayers of aggregates of rhombohedral and cone-shaped calcite on their exterior and interior surfaces, respectively. These highly crystalline and dense bilayers prohibit the development of significant electrochemical potential differences across the tube walls. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M. Kellermeier, J.&#8197;M. Garc&#237;a-Ruiz et&#8197;al. (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202101417"&gt;10.1002/chem.202101417&lt;/a&gt;).

         <dc:description>
DNA strands, modified with the novel bioorthogonal reporter sydnone, undergo fast and efficient labeling with cyclooctyne&#8211;dye conjugates, both in vitro and in HeLa cells. These results show that sydnones are versatile bioorthogonal tags and have the premise to become essential tools for tracking DNA and potentially RNA in living cells.

         <dc:description>The interaction of the self&#8208;assembled trinuclear ruthenium bowl  1  3+  , that displays three other accessible oxidation states, with oxo&#8208;anions is investigated. Using a combination of NMR and electrochemical experimental data, estimates of the binding affinities of  1  4+  ,  1  5+  , and  1  6+  for both halide and oxo&#8208;anions were derived. This analysis revealed that, across the range of oxidation states of the host, both high anion binding affinities (&gt;10  9  M  &#8211;1  for specific guests bound to  1  6+  ) and high selectivities (a range of &gt;10  7  M  &#8211;1  ) were observed. As the crystal structure of binding of the hexafluorophosphate anion revealed that the host has two potential binding sites (named the &#945; and &#946; pockets), the host&#8208;guest properties of both putative binding sites of the bowl, in all of its four oxidation states, were investigated through detailed quantum&#8208;based computational studies. These studies revealed that, due to the interplay of electrostatically assisted hydrogen&#8208;bonding and anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, binding to the &#945; pocket is generally preferred, except for the case of the relatively large and lipophilic hexafluorophosphate anionic guest and the host in the highest oxidation states, where the &#946; pocket becomes relatively favourable. This analysis confirms that host&#8208;guest interactions involving structurally complex supramolecular architectures are driven by a combination of non&#8208;covalent interactions and, even in the case of charged binding pairs, electrostatics alone cannot accurately define these recognition processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvothermal synthesis of [Cr7S8(en)8Cl2]Cl3&#183;2H2O with magnetically frustrated [Cr7S8]5+ double&#8208;cubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel transition metal chalcohalide [Cr7S8(en)8Cl2]Cl3&#183;2H2O, with [Cr7S8]5+ dicubane cationic clusters has been synthesized by a low temperature solvothermal method using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and ethylenediamine (en) solvents. Ethylenediamine ligand exhibits bi&#8208; and monodentate coordination modes, in the latter case ethylenediamine coordinates to Cr atoms of adjacent clusters, giving rise to a 2D polymeric structure. Although magnetic susceptibility shows no magnetic ordering down to 1.8 K, highly negative Weiss constant, q &#160;= &#8211;224(2) K, obtained from Curie&#8208;Weiss fit of inverse susceptibility suggests strong antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions between S = 3/2 Cr(III) centers. Due to the complexity of the system with (2S + 1)7 = 16384 microstates from seven Cr3+ centers, a simplified model with only two exchange constants was used for simulations. Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations yielded the two exchange constants to be J1 = &#8211;21.4 cm&#8211;1 and J2 = &#8211;30.2 cm&#8211;1, confirming competing AFM coupling between the shared Cr3+ center and the peripheral Cr3+ ions of the dicubane cluster.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A novel transition metal chalcohalide [Cr7S8(en)8Cl2]Cl3&#183;2H2O, with [Cr7S8]5+ dicubane cationic clusters has been synthesized by a low temperature solvothermal method using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and ethylenediamine (en) solvents. Ethylenediamine ligand exhibits bi- and monodentate coordination modes, in the latter case ethylenediamine coordinates to Cr atoms of adjacent clusters, giving rise to a 2D polymeric structure. Although magnetic susceptibility shows no magnetic ordering down to 1.8 K, highly negative Weiss constant, q &#160;= &#8211;224(2) K, obtained from Curie-Weiss fit of inverse susceptibility suggests strong antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions between S = 3/2 Cr(III) centers. Due to the complexity of the system with (2S + 1)7 = 16384 microstates from seven Cr3+ centers, a simplified model with only two exchange constants was used for simulations. Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations yielded the two exchange constants to be J1 = &#8211;21.4 cm&#8211;1 and J2 = &#8211;30.2 cm&#8211;1, confirming competing AFM coupling between the shared Cr3+ center and the peripheral Cr3+ ions of the dicubane cluster. The best simulation of the experimental data was obtained with J1 = &#8211;20.0 cm&#8211;1 and J2 = &#8211;21.0 cm&#8211;1, in agreement with the slightly stronger AFM exchange within the triangles of the peripheral Cr3+ ions as compared to the AFM exchange between the central and peripheral Cr3+ ions. This compound can be used to explore the synthesis of magnetically frustrated systems of polymeric nature, containing dicubane transition meta-chalcogenide cations and charge balancing halide anions&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Phosphorus Based Pacman Dication Generated by Cooperative Self&#8208;Activation of a Pacman Phosphane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formal coordination of phosphorus(III) by a calix[4]pyrrole Schiff base ligand was achieved via the reaction of this ligand with PCl3 under basic conditions. The reaction product adopts a Pacman conformation with two P&#8209;Cl moieties, one in exo and one in endo position. It represents the first non&#8208;metal compound of calix[4]pyrrole Schiff base ligands and of Pacman ligands in general. The spatial neighborhood of the two P atoms enables cooperative reactions. As a first example, the chloride abstraction with AgOTf is presented, yielding a macrocyclic dication with two embedded phosphorus(III) monocations, which both undergo a cooperative, internal activation reaction with an adjacent C=N double bond. This intramolecular redox process affords two pentacoordinated phosphorus(V) centers within the Pacman dication. All reaction products were fully characterized and all results are supported by computations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Trans&#8208;iso&#8208;&#945;&#8208;acid is one of the main contributors to the bitter taste of fresh beer and is known to transform into various derivatives during beer aging. Structural characterization of the derivatives has however been a challenging task because of the formation of too many components. Here, we report that most of the transformation products of trans&#8208;iso&#8208;&#945;&#8208;acid, isolated in this study in only small quantities by HPLC, can be structurally analyzed with the crystalline sponge method. Thirteen compounds, including eight that were previously unreported, have been successfully isolated and analyzed with complete assignment of their absolute configuration. This provides an improved understanding of the chemical transformations that occur during beer aging.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Merocyanine (MC) dyes exhibit facile synthesis and attractive optical properties, making them widely studied as the donor materials in organic solar cells (OSCs). In this study, for the first time, simple indole&#8208;based MCs are successfully designed as unfused nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) for OSCs by forming dimers with A&#8208;D&#8208;&amp;pi;&#8208;D&#8208;A structure, which possess enhanced photostability compared to well&#8208;known ITIC acceptor and high electron mobility in blend films. When blended with P3HT donor, one of dimers, i. e. &lt;bold&gt;Z2&lt;/bold&gt;, shows a good cell efficiency of 3.53%, which outperforms the performance of most of P3HT/NFA blends, particularly for unfused systems, and thus indicates good potential of simple MCs as NFAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights into proton dynamics in photofunctional salt&#8211;cocrystal continuum: Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray, neutron diffraction, and Hirshfeld atom refinement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>X&#8208;ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, and theoretical calculations were used to investigate the relationship between optical properties and the degree of protonation in acid&#8208;base complexes. We prepared five acid&#8208;base complexes using pyridine&#8208;modified pyrrolopyrrole derivative and salicylic acid. Two of the prepared acid&#8208;base complexes were polymorphs of guest&#8208;free crystals with green emission, while the other three were guest inclusion crystals with yellow emission containing CH  2  Cl  2  , CH  2  Br  2  , or C  2  H  4  Cl  2  . The presence or absence of guests caused emission color to change, altering the hydrogen bond strength between the acid&#8208;base complexes. The accurate N&#183;&#183;&#183;H distances between the pyridyl moiety and the carboxy group in the temperature range of 123 K to 273 K were 1.40 &#197; for the guest&#8208;free crystals and 1.25 &#197; for the guest inclusion crystals. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the complex relationship between photofunction and proton dynamics in acid&#8208;base complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Analysis of NH3&#8208;TPD Profiles for CuSSZ&#8208;13 SCR Catalyst of Controlled Al Distribution &#8211; Complexity Resolved by First Principles Thermodynamics of NH3 Desorption, IR and EPR Insight into Cu Speciation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NH3  temperature&#8208;programmed desorption (NH3&#8208;TPD)&#160;is frequently used for probing the nature of the active sites in CuSSZ&#8208;13 zeolite for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx. Herein, we propose interpretation of NH3&#8208;TPD results, which takes into account the temperature&#8208;induced dynamics of NH3  interaction with the active centers. It is based on a comprehensive DFT/GGA+D and first principles thermodynamic (FPT) modeling of NH3  adsorption on single Cu2+, Cu+, [CuOH]+  centers, dimeric [Cu&#8211;O&#8211;Cu]2+, [Cu&#8211;O22&#8211;&#8211;Cu]2+  species, segregated CuO nanocrystals and Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS). Theoretical TPD profiles are compared with the experimental data measured for samples of various Si/Al ratio and distribution of Al within the zeolite framework. Cu&#160;reduction, its relocation, followed by intrazeolite olation processes, which are concomitant with NH3  desorption, were revealed by EPR and IR. DFT/FPT results show that the peaks in the desorption profiles cannot be assigned univocally to the particular Cu and BAS centers, since the observed low&#8208;, medium&#8208; and high&#8208;temperature desorption bands have contributions coming from several species, which dynamically change their speciation and redox states during NH3&#8208;TPD experiment. Thus, the rigorous interpretation of the NH3&#8208;TPD profiles of CuSSZ&#8208;13 in terms of the strength and concentration of the active centers of a particular type is problematic.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;NH3  temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD)&#160;is frequently used for probing the nature of the active sites in CuSSZ-13 zeolite for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx. Herein, we propose interpretation of NH3-TPD results, which takes into account the temperature-induced dynamics of NH3  interaction with the active centers. It is based on a comprehensive DFT/GGA+D and first principles thermodynamic (FPT) modeling of NH3  adsorption on single Cu2+, Cu+, [CuOH]+  centers, dimeric [Cu&#8211;O&#8211;Cu]2+, [Cu&#8211;O22&#8211;&#8211;Cu]2+  species, segregated CuO nanocrystals and Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS). Theoretical TPD profiles are compared with the experimental data measured for samples of various Si/Al ratio and distribution of Al within the zeolite framework. Cu&#160;reduction, its relocation, followed by intrazeolite olation processes, which are concomitant with NH3  desorption, were revealed by EPR and IR. DFT/FPT results show that the peaks in the desorption profiles cannot be assigned univocally to the particular Cu and BAS centers, since the observed low-, medium- and high-temperature desorption bands have contributions coming from several species, which dynamically change their speciation and redox states during NH3-TPD experiment. Thus, the rigorous interpretation of the NH3-TPD profiles of CuSSZ-13 in terms of the strength and concentration of the active centers of a particular type is problematic. Nonetheless, useful connections for molecular interpretation of TPD profiles can be established between the individual component peaks and the corresponding ensembles of the adsorption centers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>PTFE/EP reinforced MOF/SiO2 composite as a superior mechanically robust superhydrophobic agent towards corrosion protection, self&#8208;cleaning and anti&#8208;icing</title>

         <dc:description>Organic resin cross&#8208;linking ZIF&#8208;67/SiO2  superhydrophobic (SHPB) multilayer coating was successfully fabricated on metal substrate. The perfluoro&#8208;octyl&#8208;triethoxy silane (POTS) modified ZIF&#8208;67 and SiO2  coating was applied on primary coated polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and epoxy resin (EP) via spray coating method. Here, we present that the robust superhydrophobicity can be realized by structuring surfaces at two different length scales, with a nanostructure design to provide water repellency and a microstructure design to provide durability. The as&#8208;fabricated multilayer coating displayed superior water&#8208;repellency (CA=167.4&#176;), chemical robustness (pH=1&#8208;14) and mechanical durability undergoing 120th linear abrasion or 35th rotatory abrasion cycle. By applying different acidic and basic corrosive media and various weathering conditions, it can still maintain superior&#8208;hydrophobicity. To get a better insight of interaction between inhibitor molecules and metal surface, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed, showing lower energy gap and increased binding energy of ZPS/SiO2/PTFE/EP (ZPS=ZIF&#8208;67+POTS) multilayer coating compared to the ZIF/SiO2/PTFE/EP, thereby supporting the experimental findings. Additionally, such coatings may be useful for applications such as anti&#8208;corrosion, self&#8208;cleaning, and anti&#8208;icing multi&#8208;functionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Modelling and Simulations of Light Harvesting Decanuclear Ru&#8208;based Dendrimers for Artificial Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structure of a decanuclear photo&#8208; and redox&#8208;active dendrimer based on Ru(II) polypyridine subunits, suitable as a light&#8208;harvesting multicomponent species for artificial photosynthesis, has been investigated by means of computer modelling. The compound has the general formula [Ru{(&#956;&#8208;dpp)Ru[(&#956;&#8208;dpp)Ru(bpy)  2  ]  2  }  3  ](PF  6  )  20  (  Ru10  ; bpy =2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine; dpp= 2,3&#8208;bis(2&#8217;&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazine). The stability of possible isomers of each monomer was investigated by performing classical molecular dynamics (MD) and quantum mechanics (QM) simulations on each monomer and comparing the results. The number of stable isomers is reduced to 36 with a prevalence of MER isomerism in the central core, as previously observed by NMR experiments. The simulations on decanuclear dendrimers suggest that the stability of the dendrimer is not linked to the stability of the individual monomers composing the dendrimer but rather governed by the steric constrains originated by the multimetallic assembly. Finally, the self&#8208;aggregation of  Ru10  and the distribution of the counterions around the complexes is investigated using Molecular Dynamics both in implicit and explicit acetonitrile solution. In representative examples, with nine and four dendrimers, the calculated pair distribution function for the ruthenium centers suggests a self&#8208;aggregation mechanism where the dendrimers are approaching in small blocks and then aggregate all together. Scanning transmission electron microscopy complements the investigation, supporting the formation of different aggregates at various concentrations.</dc:description>

         <title>The Effect of Water on the 2&#8208;Propanol Oxidation Activity of Co&#8208;Substituted LaFe1&#8722;CoxO3 Perovskites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of water addition on 2&#8208;propanol oxidation was studied on LaFe1&#8208;xCoxO3 catalysts. After surpassing a Co content threshold (x=0.15) the effect of water on the activity at elevated temperatures is beneficial due to slower Co3+ reduction and the number of hydroxide species on the catalyst surface increased.







Abstract
Perovskites are interesting oxidation catalysts due to their chemical flexibility enabling the tuning of several properties. In this work, we synthesized LaFe1&#8722;xCoxO3 catalysts by co&#8208;precipitation and thermal decomposition, characterized them thoroughly and studied their 2&#8208;propanol oxidation activity under dry and wet conditions to bridge the knowledge gap between gas and liquid phase reactions. Transient tests showed a highly active, unstable low&#8208;temperature (LT) reaction channel in conversion profiles and a stable, less&#8208;active high&#8208;temperature (HT) channel. Cobalt incorporation had a positive effect on the activity. The effect of water was negative on the LT channel, whereas the HT channel activity was boosted for x&gt;0.15. The boost may originate from a slower deactivation rate of the Co3+ sites under wet conditions and a higher amount of hydroxide species on the surface comparing wet to dry feeds. Water addition resulted in a slower deactivation for Co&#8208;rich catalysts and higher activity in the HT channel state.

         <title>Activation of Molecular O2 on CoFe2O4 (001) Surfaces: An Embedded Cluster Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activation pathways for dioxygen on the (001) surfaces of inverse spinel CoFe2O4 were investigated using the periodic electrostatic embedded cluster model. Reduction of molecular O2 into superoxide is relatively facile, whereas the subsequent dissociation into reactive monoatomic species is associated with large energy barriers that may limit the rate of oxidation processes. Of the metal&#8208;O species, [FeIII&#8722;O]2+ is thermodynamically most stable.







Abstract
Dioxygen activation pathways on the (001) surfaces of cobalt ferrite, CoFe2O4, were investigated computationally using density functional theory and the hybrid Perdew&#8208;Burke&#8208;Ernzerhof exchange&#8208;correlation functional (PBE0) within the periodic electrostatic embedded cluster model. We considered two terminations: the A&#8208;layer exposing Fe2+ and Co2+ metal sites in tetrahedral and octahedral positions, respectively, and the B&#8208;layer exposing octahedrally coordinated Co3+. On the A&#8208;layer, molecular oxygen is chemisorbed as a superoxide on the Fe monocenter or bridging a Fe&#8722;Co cation pair, whereas on the B&#8208;layer it is adsorbed at the most stable anionic vacancy. Activation is promoted by transfer of electrons provided by the d metal centers onto the adsorbed oxygen. The subsequent dissociation of dioxygen into monoatomic species and surface reoxidation have been identified as the most critical steps that may limit the rate of the oxidation processes. Of the reactive metal&#8208;O species, [FeIII&#8722;O]2+ is thermodynamically most stable, while the oxygen of the Co&#8722;O species may easily migrate across the A&#8208;layer with barriers smaller than the associative desorption.

Reduction of molecular O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into superoxide is relatively facile, whereas the subsequent dissociation into reactive monoatomic species is associated with large energy barriers that may limit the rate of oxidation processes. Of the metal-O species, [Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;O]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is thermodynamically most stable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dioxygen activation pathways on the (001) surfaces of cobalt ferrite, CoFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, were investigated computationally using density functional theory and the hybrid Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchange-correlation functional (PBE0) within the periodic electrostatic embedded cluster model. We considered two terminations: the A-layer exposing Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; metal sites in tetrahedral and octahedral positions, respectively, and the B-layer exposing octahedrally coordinated Co&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. On the A-layer, molecular oxygen is chemisorbed as a superoxide on the Fe monocenter or bridging a Fe&#8722;Co cation pair, whereas on the B-layer it is adsorbed at the most stable anionic vacancy. Activation is promoted by transfer of electrons provided by the &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; metal centers onto the adsorbed oxygen. The subsequent dissociation of dioxygen into monoatomic species and surface reoxidation have been identified as the most critical steps that may limit the rate of the oxidation processes. Of the reactive metal-O species, [Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;O]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is thermodynamically most stable, while the oxygen of the Co&#8722;O species may easily migrate across the A-layer with barriers smaller than the associative desorption.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rh(I)/(III)&#8208;N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complexes: Effect of Steric Confinement Upon Immobilization on Regio&#8208; and Stereoselectivity in the Hydrosilylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel Rh(III) pentamethylcyclopentadienyl and Rh(I) complexes containing chelating N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes have been prepared and used in the hydrosilylation of 1&#8208;alkynes. Selected catalysts were immobilized within the mesopores of SBA&#8208;15. The confinement effects either provided by the ligands or the mesoporous support have been studied and allow for hydrosilylation with &#946;(Z)&#8208;selectivity of up to 100&#8201;% with both Rh(I) and Rh(III) complexes.







Abstract
Rh(I) NHC and Rh(III) Cp* NHC complexes (Cp*=pentamethylcyclopentadienyl, NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene=pyrid&#8208;2&#8208;ylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (Py&#8722;Im), thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;ylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) are presented. Selected catalysts were selectively immobilized inside the mesopores of SBA&#8208;15 with average pore diameters of 5.0 and 6.2&#8197;nm. Together with their homogenous progenitors, the immobilized catalysts were used in the hydrosilylation of terminal alkynes. For aromatic alkynes, both the neutral and cationic Rh(I) complexes showed excellent reactivity with exclusive formation of the &#946;(E)&#8208;isomer. For aliphatic alkynes, however, selectivity of the Rh(I) complexes was low. By contrast, the neutral and cationic Rh(III) Cp* NHC complexes proved to be highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective catalysts, allowing for the formation of the thermodynamically less stable &#946;&#8208;(Z)&#8208;vinylsilane isomers at room temperature. Notably, the SBA&#8208;15 immobilized Rh(I) catalysts, in which the pore walls provide an additional confinement, showed excellent &#946;&#8208;(Z)&#8208;selectivity in the hydrosilylation of aliphatic alkynes, too. Also, in the case of 4&#8208;aminophenylacetylene, selective formation of the &#946;(Z)&#8208;isomer was observed with a neutral SBA&#8208;15 supported Rh(III) Cp* NHC complex but not with its homogenous counterpart. These are the first examples of high &#946;(Z)&#8208;selectivity in the hydrosilylation of alkynes by confinement generated upon immobilization inside mesoporous silica.

         <title>Methane Activation by (MoO3)5O&#8722; Cluster Anions: The Importance of Orbital Orientation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C&#8722;H activation of CH4 by the bridging oxygen radical (Ob.&#8722;) over molybdenum oxide cluster anions has been experimentally identified under thermal collision conditions. The empty 2p orbital of Ob.&#8722; is perpendicular to the surface of (MoO3)5O&#8722; cluster that is superior to the (MoO3)6O&#8722; cluster that contains a Ob.&#8722; radical with the empty 2p orbital being parallel to the cluster surface.







Abstract
The reactivity of the molybdenum oxide cluster anion (MoO3)5O&#8722;, bearing an unpaired electron at a bridging oxygen atom (Ob.&#8722;), towards methane under thermal collision conditions has been studied by mass spectrometry and density functional theory calculations. This reaction follows the mechanism of hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and is facilitated by the Ob.&#8722; radical center. The reactivity of (MoO3)5O&#8722; can be traced back to the appropriate orientation of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) that is essentially the 2p orbital of the Ob.&#8722; atom. This study not only makes up the blank of thermal methane activation by the Ob.&#8722; radical on negatively charged clusters but also yields new insights into methane activation by the atomic oxygen radical anions.

The emergence and development of the concept of &#8220;anion&#8208;&#960; catalysis&#8221;, that employing an electron&#8208;deficient &#960; surface for anionic intermediate and transition state stabilization, is illustrated. Different activation modes are presented to highlight the essential contribution of anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, from both ground&#8208;state and transition&#8208;state stabilization to solely transition&#8208;state stabilization, and to cooperative &#960;&#8208;face activation.







Abstract
Since its discovery two decades ago, anion&#8208;&#960; interaction has been increasingly recognized as an important driving force. Extensive theoretical and experimental efforts on the ground&#8208;state anion&#8208;&#960; binding and recognition have laid the bases for exploring its relevance in catalysis. Accordingly, the concept of &#8220;anion&#8208;&#960; catalysis&#8221; that employing an electron&#8208;deficient &#960; surface (&#960;&#8208;acidic surface) for anionic reaction intermediate and transition state stabilization has emerged. This article shortly reviews the emergence and development of this concept, aiming to provide an emphasis on the general concept and key progress in this exciting area. To highlight the essential contribution of anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, the contents are organized according to their role engaged in catalytic process, for example from both ground&#8208;state and transition&#8208;state stabilization to solely transition&#8208;state stabilization, mainly by a single &#960;&#8208;face, and to cooperative &#960;&#8208;face activation. A concluding remark and outlook on future development of this field is also given.

         <title>Ring Size Determines the Conformation, Global Aromaticity and Photophysical Properties of Macrocyclic Oligofurans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocycles, there is a trade&#8208;off between the global and local expression of effects such as aromaticity, with the outcome of the trade&#8208;off determined by the geometry and aromaticity of the constituent units. Compared with other aromatic rings, furan aromaticity is relatively low, and therefore global effects in macrocyclic furans are expected to be more pronounced. Following our introduction of macrocyclic oligofuran, we present the first synthesis of a series of &#960;&#8208;conjugated bifuran macrocycles of various ring sizes, from trimer to hexamer, and characterize them using both computational and experimental methods. The properties of macrocyclic oligofurans change considerably with size: The smaller trimer is rigid, non&#8208;emissive and planar as revealed by its single crystal structure, and displays global antiaromaticity, while the larger pentamer and hexamer are flexible, emissive, have non&#8208;planar structures, and exhibit local aromaticity. The results are supported by NICS and ACID calculations that indicate the global antiaromaticity of planar furan macrocycles, and by transient absorption measurements showing sharp absorption bands for the trimer and only the internal conversion decay pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Perovskite Light&#8208;emitting Electrochemical Cells Employing Electron Injection/Transport Layers of Ionic Transition Metal Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, perovskites have attracted intense attention due to their high potential in optoelectronic applications. Employing perovskites as the emissive materials of light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) shows the advantages of simple fabrication process, low&#8208;voltage operation, compatibility with inert electrodes, along with saturated electroluminescence (EL) emission. Different from previously reported perovskite LECs, in which salts are incorporated in the emissive layer, we separate the ion&#8208;transport layer from the emissive layer in this work. The layer of ionic transition metal complex (iTMC) not only provides mobile ions but also serves as an electron injection/transport layer. Orthogonal solvents are used in spin coating to prevent intermixing of stacked perovskite and iTMC layers. The blue iTMC with high ionization potential is effective in blocking holes from the emissive layer and thus ensures EL color saturation. In addition, the carrier balance of the perovskite/iTMC LECs can be optimized by adjusting the iTMC layer thickness. The optimized external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the CsPbBr3/iTMC LEC reach 6.8%, which is among the highest reported values for perovskite LECs so far. Compared with mixing all components in a single emissive layer, this work successfully demonstrates that separating the layer of ion transport, electron injection and transport from the perovskite emissive layer is more effective in adjusting device carrier balance. As such, solution&#8208;processable perovskite/iTMC LECs open up a new way to realize efficient perovskite LECs.</dc:description>

         <title>Catechol Moiety Integrated Tri&#8208;aryl Type AIEgen for Visual and Quantitative Boronic Acid Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel functional AIEgen based on three compact bound aryl skeletons is designed and synthesized. This tri&#8208;aryl type luminogen (TA&#8208;Catechol) embedded with catechol moiety responds rapidly to series of boronic acids. Real&#8208;time visual and quantitative dual&#8208;mode detection method is established for the first time with modest precision and low detection limit (8.0 &#956;M). Detailed mechanistic discussion identifies tetra&#8208;coordinated boronic species as the key intermediate within sensing procedure. Wide range of organic boronic acids compatible with this strategy is displayed which is promising in high throughput screening technology. Furthermore, solid&#8208;state sensing capability of TA&#8208;Catechol is also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>How 5f electron polarizability drives covalency and selectivity in actinide N&#8208;donor complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a series of isostructural tetravalent actinide (Th, U&#8208;Pu) complexes with the  N  &#8208;donor ligand  N  ,  N  '&#8208;ethylene&#8208;bis((pyrrole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methanimine) (H  2  L, H  2  pyren). Structural data from SC&#8208;XRD analysis reveal [An(pyren)  2  ] complexes with different An&#8211;N  imine  vs. An&#8211;N  pyrrolide  bond lengths, respectively. Quantum chemical calculations elucidate the bonding situation, including differences in covalent character of the coordinative bonds. A comparison to the intensely studied analogous  N  ,  N  &#8242;&#8208; ethylene&#8208; bis(salicylideneimine) (H  2  salen) based complexes [An(salen)  2  ] displays on average almost equal electron sharing of pyren or salen with the An(IV), pointing to a potential ligand&#8208;cage&#8208;driven complex stabilization. This is shown in the fixed ligand arrangement of pyren and salen in the respective An(IV) complexes. The overall bond strength of the pure  N  &#8208;donor ligand pyren to An(IV) (An=Th, U, Np, Pu) is slightly weaker compared

to salen, with the exception of the Pa(IV) complex, which exhibits extraordinarily high electron sharing of pyren with Pa(IV). Such an altered ligand preference within the early An(IV) series points to a specificity of the 5  f  1  configuration, which can be explained by polarization effects of the 5  f  electrons, allowing strongest  f  electron backbonding from Pa(IV) (5  f  1  ) to the  N  &#8208;donors of pyren.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the reactivity of substrate for SNAP&#8208;tag expands its application for recognition&#8208;driven DNA&#8208;protein conjugation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recognition&#8208;driven modification has been emerging as a novel approach to modify biomolecular targets of interest site&#8208;specifically and efficiently. To this end, the protein modular adaptors (MAs) are the ideal reaction model for recognition&#8208;driven modification of DNA, which constitute both a sequence&#8208;specific DNA&#8208;binding domain (DBD) and a self&#8208;ligating protein&#8208;tag. Coupling the DNA recognition by DBD and the chemoselective reaction of protein tag could provide a highly efficient sequence&#8208;specific reaction. However, combination of MA consisting of a reactive protein&#8208;tag and its substrate,  e.g.,  SNAP&#8208;tag and benzyl guanine (BG), revealed rather non&#8208;selective reaction with DNA. Here, we designed new substrates of SNAP&#8208;tag to realize the sequence&#8208;selective rapid closslinking reaction by MAs with SNAP&#8208;tag. The reactions of substrates to SNAP&#8208;tag were verified by kinetic analyses to enable the sequence&#8208;selective crosslinking reaction of MA. The new substrate enables distinctive orthogonality of SNAP&#8208;tag against CLIP&#8208;tag to achieve the orthogonal DNA&#8208;protein cross&#8208;linking reaction by six unique MAs.</dc:description>
