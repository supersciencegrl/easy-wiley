         <title>Increased Photostability of the Integral mRNA Vaccine Component N1&#8208;Methylpseudouridine Compared to Uridine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N  1  &#8208;methylation of pseudouridine (m  1  &#968;) replaces uridine in several therapeutics, including the Moderna and BioNTech&#8208;Pfizer COVID19 vaccines. Importantly, however, it is currently unknown if exposure to electromagnetic radiation can affect the chemical integrity and intrinsic stability of m1&#968;. In this study, the photochemistry of m  1  &#968; is compared to that of uridine using photoirradiation at 267 nm, steady&#8208;state spectroscopy, and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Furthermore, femtosecond transient absorption measurements are collected to delineate the electronic relaxation mechanisms for both nucleosides under physiologically relevant conditions. It is shown that m  1  &#968; exhibits a 12&#8208;fold longer  1  &#960;&#960;* decay lifetime than uridine and a 5&#8208;fold higher fluorescence yield. Notably, however, the experimental results also demonstrate that most of the excited state population in both nucleosides decays back to the ground state in an ultrafast time scale and that m  1  &#968; is 6.7&#8208;fold more photostable than uridine following irradiation at 267 nm.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Heme&#8208;Iron&#8208;Mediated Selective Halogenation of Unactivated Carbon&#8722;Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Slowly, but surely: The iron(IV)&#8208;oxido complex [(L1)(Cl)FeIV=O]+ with a chloride in cis position to the oxido group is an excellent model for non&#8208;heme&#8208;iron halogenases: it activates the very strong C&#8722;H bonds of cyclohexane and selectively leads to the halogenated product. Although it is the fastest iron(IV)&#8208;oxido model system known, formation of an oxido&#8208;bridged diiron(III) resting is the dominating reaction, and the halogenation itself therefore is a relatively slow but still selective process.







Abstract
Oxidation of the iron(II) precursor [(L1)FeIICl2], where L1 is a tetradentate bispidine, with soluble iodosylbenzene (sPhIO) leads to the extremely reactive ferryl oxidant [(L1)(Cl)FeIV=O]+ with a cis disposition of the chlorido and oxido coligands, as observed in non&#8208;heme halogenase enzymes. Experimental data indicate that, with cyclohexane as substrate, there is selective formation of chlorocyclohexane, the halogenation being initiated by C&#8722;H abstraction and the result of a rebound of the ensuing radical to an iron&#8208;bound Cl&#8722;. The time&#8208;resolved formation of the halogenation product indicates that this primarily results from sPhIO oxidation of an initially formed oxido&#8208;bridged diiron(III) resting state. The high yield of up to &gt;70&#8201;% (stoichiometric reaction) as well as the differing reactivities of free Fe2+ and Fe3+ in comparison with [(L1)FeIICl2] indicate a high complex stability of the bispidine&#8208;iron complexes. DFT analysis shows that, due to a large driving force and small triplet&#8208;quintet gap, [(L1)(Cl)FeIV=O]+ is the most reactive small&#8208;molecule halogenase model, that the FeIII/radical rebound intermediate has a relatively long lifetime (as supported by experimentally observed cage escape), and that this intermediate has, as observed experimentally, a lower energy barrier to the halogenation than the hydroxylation product; this is shown to primarily be due to steric effects.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Pulvomycin D</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Fragile Diva: Trienone units and the elimination&#8208;prone hydroxy groups render pulvomycin D a capricious target, the total synthesis of which required a subtle endgame strategy, including a Heck reaction (3) and a sequential release of six silyl protecting groups combined with a Peterson elimination reaction (4). Earlier key steps of the synthesis included a diastereoselective aldol reaction (1) and a regioselective Yamaguchi esterification (2).







Abstract
A synthetic route to the pulvomycin class of natural products is presented, which culminated in the first synthesis of a pulvomycin, pulvomycin D. Key elements of the strategy include a pivotal aldol reaction which led to bond formation between the C24&#8208;C40 and the C8&#8208;C23 fragment. The remaining C1&#8208;C7 fragment was attached by a Yamaguchi esterification completing the assembly of the 40 carbon atoms within the main skeleton. Ring closure to the 22&#8208;membered lactone ring was achieved in the final stages of the synthesis by a Heck reaction. The completion of the synthesis required the removal of six silyl protecting groups in combination with olefin formation at C26&#8208;C27 by a Peterson elimination.

Ring closure to the 22-membered lactone ring was achieved in the final stages of the synthesis by a Heck reaction. The completion of the synthesis required the removal of six silyl protecting groups in combination with olefin formation at C26-C27 by a Peterson elimination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Indeno[1,2,3,4&#8208;pqra]Perylene: A Medium&#8208;Sized Aromatic Hydrocarbon Exhibiting Full&#8208;Range Visible&#8208;Light Absorption</title>

         <dc:description>
The synthesis and properties of indeno[1,2,3,4&#8208;pqra]perylene are described. Indenoperylene is a medium&#8208;sized aromatic hydrocarbon with the composition C24H12 that is isomeric to coronene. Nevertheless, its absorption covers the entire visible region owing to its small HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. Furthermore, indenoperylene exhibits high stability despite the absence of peripheral substituents.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and properties of indeno[1,2,3,4&#8208;pqra]perylene, which was prepared by the fusion of one anthracene unit with one naphthalene unit via three carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. The synthetic route through two&#8208;fold C&#8722;H arylation enabled not only the synthesis of unsubstituted indenoperylene, but also rapid access to its arylated derivatives on the gram scale. Indenoperylene is a medium&#8208;sized aromatic hydrocarbon with the composition C24H12 that is isomeric to coronene. Nevertheless, its absorption covers the entire visible region owing to its small HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. Furthermore, indenoperylene exhibits high stability despite the absence of peripheral substituents. We propose that the unique electronic structure of indenoperylene originates from the coexistence of an electron&#8208;withdrawing subunit (benzoaceanthrylene) and an electron&#8208;donating subunit (perylene). The electronic properties of indenoperylene were modulated via post&#8208;functionalization through regioselective bromination. The current research demonstrates that indenoperylene is a promising candidate as a main skeleton for near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive and redox&#8208;active materials.

         <title>Mechanism&#8208;Based Approach to Reagent Selection for Oxidative Carbon&#8722;Hydrogen Bond Cleavage Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selecting the optimal reagent for an oxidative C&#8722;H cleavage reaction requires mechanistic understanding of these processes. This manuscript describes an experimental approach to identify the role of substrate oxidation potential, cation stability, and steric factors on reaction rates and yields with common oxidants. The results are explained through computational transition state energetic and geometric analyses.







Abstract
Numerous hydride&#8208;abstracting agents generate the same cationic intermediate, but substrate features such as intermediate cation stability, oxidation potential, and steric environment can influence reaction rates in an oxidant&#8208;dependent manner. This manuscript provides experimental data to illustrate the role that structural features play in the kinetics of hydride abstraction reactions with commonly used quinone&#8208;, oxoammonium ion&#8208;, and carbocation&#8208; based oxidants. Computational studies of the transition state structures and energies explain these results and energy decomposition analysis calculations reveal unique sensitivities to electrostatic attraction and steric repulsions. Rigorous rate studies of select reactions validated the capacity of the calculations to predict reactivity trends. Additionally, kinetics studies demonstrate the potential for product inhibition in DDQ&#8208;mediated reactions. These studies provide a clear guide to select the optimal oxidant for structurally disparate substrates and lead to predictions of reactivity that were validated experimentally.

         <title>Orthogonal Catalysis for an Enantioselective Domino Inverse&#8208;Electron Demand Diels&#8722;Alder/Substitution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thioether substituted trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydronaphthalines have been accessed through a novel enantioselective domino process. Lewis acid activation and organocatalysis were combined to generate the products from readily available substances. A new chiral amine catalyst ensures high enantiomeric ratios. Both enantiomers of the product can be derived and the configuration on the newly generated stereo centers were unambiguously related to the chirality of the amine.







Abstract
An enantioselective domino process for the synthesis of substituted 1,2&#8208;dihydronaphthalenes has been developed by the combination of chiral amines and a bidentate Lewis acid in an orthogonal catalysis. This new method is based on an inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8722;Alder and a subsequent group exchange reaction. An enamine is generated in&#8197;situ from an aldehyde and a chiral secondary amine catalyst that reacts with phthalazine, activated by the coordination to a bidentate Lewis acid catalyst. The absolute configuration of the product is controlled by chiral information provided by the amine. The formed ortho&#8208;quinodimethane intermediate is then transformed via a group exchange reaction with thiols. The new method shows a broad scope and tolerates a wide range of functional groups with enantiomeric ratios up to 91&#8201;:&#8201;9. All&#8208;in&#8208;all, this enantioselective synthesis tool provides an easy access to complex 1,2&#8208;dihydronaphthalenes starting from readily available phthalazine, aldehydes and thiols in a combinatorial way.

         <title>An Isolable Gallium&#8208;Substituted Nitrilimine and its Reactivity with B&#8722;H, Si&#8722;H and B&#8722;B Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of diazomethane N2CHSiMe3 with the Ga(I) compound NacNacGa affords the nitrilimine complex 10 that undergoes 1,3&#8208;addition reactions with silane and borane to give products 16 and 17 but an unusual 1,1&#8208;addition of diborane (Bcat)2 (cat=catecholate) to give the diborylamide compound 18. DFT calculations provide insight into the mechanism of formation of compound 9 and 18.







Abstract
Reaction of the Ga(I) compound NacNacGa (9) with the diazo compound N2CHSiMe3 affords the nitrilimine compound NacNacGa(N&#8208;NCSiMe3)(CH2SiMe3) (10). Carrying out this reaction in the presence of pyridine does not lead to C&#8722;H activation on the transient alkylidene NacNacGa=CHSiMe3 but generates a metallated diazo species NacNacGa(NHN=CHSiMe3)(CN2SiMe3) (13) that further rearranges into the isonitrile compound NacNacGa(NHN=CHSiMe3)(N(NC)SiMe3) (15). Reactions of 10 with the silane H3SiPh and the borane HBcat furnished products of 1,3 addition to the nitrilimine moiety NacNacGa{N(ERn)NCSiMe3}(CH2SiMe3), whereas reaction with the diborane B2cat2 gave the product of formal nitrene insertion into the B&#8722;B bond. DFT calculations suggest that the interaction of 9 with N2CHSiMe3 proceeds through intermediate formation of an alkylidene compound that undergoes CH activation with a second molecule of N2CHSiMe3. Insertion into the B&#8722;B bond likely proceeds through an initial 1,3&#8208;addition of the diborane, followed by boryl migration to the former nitrene center.

&lt;/b&gt; with the Ga(I) compound NacNacGa affords the nitrilimine complex &lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt; that undergoes 1,3-addition reactions with silane and borane to give products &lt;b&gt;16&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;17&lt;/b&gt; but an unusual 1,1-addition of diborane (Bcat)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (cat=catecholate) to give the diborylamide compound &lt;b&gt;18&lt;/b&gt;.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaction of the Ga(I) compound NacNacGa (&lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;) with the diazo compound N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHSiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; affords the nitrilimine compound NacNacGa(N-NCSiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) (&lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt;). Carrying out this reaction in the presence of pyridine does not lead to C&#8722;H activation on the transient alkylidene NacNacGa=CHSiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; but generates a metallated diazo species NacNacGa(NHN=CHSiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(CN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) (&lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt;) that further rearranges into the isonitrile compound NacNacGa(NHN=CHSiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(N(NC)SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) (&lt;b&gt;15&lt;/b&gt;). Reactions of &lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt; with the silane H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiPh and the borane HBcat furnished products of 1,3 addition to the nitrilimine moiety NacNacGa{N(ER&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;)NCSiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), whereas reaction with the diborane B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;cat&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gave the product of formal nitrene insertion into the B&#8722;B bond. DFT calculations suggest that the interaction of &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt; with N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHSiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; proceeds through intermediate formation of an alkylidene compound that undergoes CH activation with a second molecule of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHSiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Insertion into the B&#8722;B bond likely proceeds through an initial 1,3-addition of the diborane, followed by boryl migration to the former nitrene center.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Uranium(IV) Thio&#8208; and Selenoether Complexes: Syntheses, Structures, and Computational Investigation of U&#8722;ER2 Interactions</title>

         <dc:description>
Actinide&#8211;soft donor linkages are of importance in the context of lanthanide&#8208;actinide separation. The first example of a uranium selenoether complex has been prepared through the use of a rigid SeNSe&#8208;donor pincer ligand. The thioether analogue was also synthesized. Computational studies, including NBO, AIM and ELF calculations, revealed increasing covalency in U&#8722;ER2 bonding from O to S to Se.







Abstract
Rigid thioether&#8208; and selenoether&#8208;containing pincer proligands H[AS2
] (1) and H[ASe2
] (2) were synthesized, and deprotonation provided the potassium salts [K(AS2
)(dme)] (3) and [K(ASe2
)(dme)2] (4). Reaction of two equivalents of 3 or 4 with [UI4(dioxane)2] afforded the uranium thioether complex [(AS2
)2UI2] (5) and the first example of a uranium&#8208;selenoether complex, [(ASe2
)2UI2] (6). X&#8208;ray structures revealed distorted square antiprismatic geometries in which the AE2
 ligands are &#954;3&#8208;coordinated. The nature of the U&#8722;ER2 bonding in 5 and 6, as well as methyl&#8208;free analogues of 5 and 6 and a hypothetical ether analogue, was investigated computationally (including NBO, AIM, and ELF calculations) illustrating increasing covalency from O to S to Se.

         <title>Deciphering the Role of Anions and Secondary Coordination Sphere in Tuning Anisotropy in Dy(III) Air&#8208;Stable D5h SIMs**
</title>

Bigger the better! The change of hydrogen&#8208;bonded halide anions in the secondary coordination sphere of a pseudo&#8208;D5h Dy(III) single&#8208;ion magnet shows a subtle alteration in the magnetic properties. The Ueff, TB and coercivity decrease in the order I&gt;Br&gt;Cl through change of anions in the secondary coordination sphere from larger iodide to smaller chloride ions.







Abstract
Precise control of the crystal field and symmetry around the paramagnetic spin centre has recently facilitated the engineering of high&#8208;temperature single&#8208;ion magnets (SIMs), the smallest possible units for future spin&#8208;based devices. In the present work, we report a series of air&#8208;stable seven coordinate Dy(III) SIMs {[L2Dy(H2O)5][X]3&#8901;L2&#8901;n(H2O), n = 0, X = Cl (1), n=1, X = Br (2), I (3)} possessing pseudo&#8208;D5h symmetry or pentagonal bipyramidal coordination geometry with high anisotropy energy barrier (Ueff) and blocking temperature (TB). While the strong axial coordination from the sterically encumbered phosphonamide, tBuPO(NHiPr)2 (L), increases the overall anisotropy of the system, the presence of high symmetry significantly quenches quantum tunnelling of magnetization, which is the prominent deactivating factor encountered in SIMs. The energy barrier (Ueff) and the blocking temperature (TB) decrease in the order 3&gt;2&gt;1 with the change of anions from larger iodide to smaller strongly hydrogen&#8208;bonded chloride in the secondary coordination sphere, albeit the local coordination geometry and the symmetry around the Dy(III) display only slight deviations. Ab initio CASSCF/RASSI&#8208;SO/SINGLE_ANISO calculations provide deeper insights into the dynamics of magnetic relaxation in addition to the role of the secondary coordination sphere in modulating the anisotropy of the D5h systems, using diverse models. Thus, in addition to the importance of the crystal field and the symmetry to obtain high&#8208;temperature SIMs, this study also probes the significance of the secondary coordination sphere that can be tailored to accomplish novel SIMs.

         <title>Regioselective Fluorination of Acenes: Tailoring of Molecular Electronic Levels and Solid State Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optoelectronic properties of molecular solids are important for organic electronic devices and are largely determined by the adopted molecular packing motifs. In this study we analyzed such structure&#8208;property relationships for the partially regioselective fluorinated tetracenes 1,2,12&#8208;trifluorotetracene, 1,2,10,12&#8208;tetra&#173;fluoro&#173;tetracene and 1,2,9,10,11&#8208;penta&#173;fluoro&#173;&#173;tetracene that were further compared with tetracene and perfluoro&#8208;tetracene. Quantum chemical DFT calculations in combination with optical absorption spectroscopy data show that the frontier orbital energies are lowered with the degree of fluorination, while their optical gap is barely affected. However, the crystal structure changes from a herringbone packing motif of tetracene towards a planar stacking motif of the fluorinated tetracene derivatives, which is accompanied by the formation of excimers and leads to strongly red&#8208;shifted photoluminescence with larger lifetimes.</dc:description>

         <title>Competing Reaction Pathways in Heterogeneously Catalyzed Hydrogenation of Allyl Cyanide: The Chemical Nature of Surface Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 68, Page 17240-17254, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanistic study on partial hydrogenation of allyl cyanide over Pd(111) model catalyst addressed by a combination of molecular beam techniques and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy is presented. Two competing reaction pathways were detected spectroscopically, resulting in formation of stable N&#8208;butylimine and unstable C&#8208;butylamine surface species. The successive evolution of the reaction intermediates for both pathways was monitored as a function of reaction temperature.







Abstract
We present a mechanistic study on the formation of an active ligand layer over Pd(111), turning the catalytic surface highly active and selective in partial hydrogenation of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde acrolein. Specifically, we investigate the chemical composition of a ligand layer consisting of allyl cyanide deposited on Pd(111) and its dynamic changes under the hydrogenation conditions. On pristine surface, allyl cyanide largely retains its chemical structure and forms a layer of molecular species with the CN bond oriented nearly parallel to the underlying metal. In the presence of hydrogen, the chemical composition of allyl cyanide strongly changes. At 100&#8197;K, allyl cyanide transforms to unsaturated imine species, containing the C=C and C=N double bonds. At increasing temperatures, these species undergo two competing reaction pathways. First, the C=C bond become hydrogenated and the stable N&#8208;butylimine species are produced. In the competing pathway, the unsaturated imine reacts with hydrogen to fully hydrogenate the imine group and produce butylamine. The latter species are unstable under the hydrogenation reaction conditions and desorb from the surface, while the N&#8208;butylimine adsorbates formed in the first reaction pathway remain adsorbed and act as an active ligand layer in selective hydrogenation of acrolein.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A mechanistic study&lt;/b&gt; on partial hydrogenation of allyl cyanide over Pd(111) model catalyst addressed by a combination of molecular beam techniques and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy is presented. Two competing reaction pathways were detected spectroscopically, resulting in formation of stable N-butylimine and unstable C-butylamine surface species. The successive evolution of the reaction intermediates for both pathways was monitored as a function of reaction temperature.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present a mechanistic study on the formation of an active ligand layer over Pd(111), turning the catalytic surface highly active and selective in partial hydrogenation of an &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated aldehyde acrolein. Specifically, we investigate the chemical composition of a ligand layer consisting of allyl cyanide deposited on Pd(111) and its dynamic changes under the hydrogenation conditions. On pristine surface, allyl cyanide largely retains its chemical structure and forms a layer of molecular species with the CN bond oriented nearly parallel to the underlying metal. In the presence of hydrogen, the chemical composition of allyl cyanide strongly changes. At 100&#8197;K, allyl cyanide transforms to unsaturated imine species, containing the C=C and C=N double bonds. At increasing temperatures, these species undergo two competing reaction pathways. First, the C=C bond become hydrogenated and the stable N-butylimine species are produced. In the competing pathway, the unsaturated imine reacts with hydrogen to fully hydrogenate the imine group and produce butylamine. The latter species are unstable under the hydrogenation reaction conditions and desorb from the surface, while the N-butylimine adsorbates formed in the first reaction pathway remain adsorbed and act as an active ligand layer in selective hydrogenation of acrolein.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Water&#8208;Assisted Chemical Route Towards the Oxygen Evolution Reaction at the Hydrated (110) Ruthenium Oxide Surface: Heterogeneous Catalysis via DFT&#8208;MD and Metadynamics Simulations</title>

The present study quantitatively assesses the free&#8208;energy barriers behind the OER at the hydrated (110)&#8208;RuO2 catalyst surface revealing a noticeable water&#8208;assisted reaction pathway where the explicit water environment acts as co&#8208;catalyst enhancing the OER.







Abstract
Notwithstanding that RuO2 is a promising catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a plethora of fundamental details on its catalytic properties are still elusive, severely limiting its large&#8208;scale deployment. It is also established experimentally that corrosion and wettability of metal oxides can, in fact, enhance the catalytic activity for OER owing to the formation of a hydrated surface layer. However, the mechanistic interplay between surface wettability, interfacial water dynamics and OER across RuO2, and what degree these processes are correlated are still debated. Herein, spin&#8208;polarized Density Functional Theory Molecular Dynamics (DFT&#8208;MD) simulations, coupled with advanced enhanced sampling methods in the well&#8208;tempered metadynamics framework, are applied to gain a global understanding of RuO2 aqueous interface (explicit water solvent) in catalyzing the OER, and hence possibly help in the design of novel catalysts in the context of photochemical water oxidation. The present study quantitatively assesses the free&#8208;energy barriers behind the OER at the (110)&#8208;RuO2 catalyst surface revealing plausible pathways composing the reaction network of the O2 evolution. In particular, OER is investigated at room temperature when such a surface is exposed to both gas&#8208;phase and liquid&#8208;phase water. Albeit a unique efficient pathway has been identified in the gas&#8208;phase OER, a surprisingly lowest&#8208;free&#8208;energy&#8208;requiring reaction route is possible when (110)&#8208;RuO2 is in contact with explicit liquid water. By estimating the free&#8208;energy surfaces associated to these processes, we reveal a noticeable water&#8208;assisted OER mechanism which involves a crucial proton&#8208;transfer&#8208;step assisted by the local water environment. These findings pave the way toward the systematic usage of DFT&#8208;MD coupled with metadynamics techniques for the fine assessment of the activity of catalysts, considering finite&#8208;temperature and explicit&#8208;solvent effects.

The dynamical interaction of n&#8208;butane, iso&#8208;butane and 1&#8208;butene with 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquids is investigated by determining the temperature&#8208;dependent initial trapping probabilities by using molecular beam techniques. The adsorption and desorption energy increases with increasing length of the alkyl substituent of the cation, decreasing size of the anion and in the order iso&#8208;butane&lt;1&#8208;butene&lt;n&#8208;butane when changing the adsorbing molecule.







Abstract
The interaction of molecules, especially hydrocarbons, at the gas/ionic liquid (IL) surface plays a crucial role in supported IL catalysis. The dynamics of this process is investigated by measuring the trapping probabilities of n&#8208;butane, iso&#8208;butane and 1&#8208;butene on a set of frozen 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;based ILs [CnC1Im]X, where n=4, 8 and X&#8722;=Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, [PF6]&#8722; and [Tf2N]&#8722;. The decrease of the initial trapping probability with increasing surface temperature is used to determine the desorption energy of the hydrocarbons at the IL surfaces. It increases with increasing alkyl chain length n and decreasing anion size for the ILs studied. We attribute these effects to different degrees of alkyl chain surface enrichment, while interactions between the adsorbate and the anion do not play a significant role. The adsorption energy also depends on the adsorbing molecule: It decreases in the order n&#8208;butane&gt;1&#8208;butene&gt;iso&#8208;butane, which can be explained by different dispersion interactions.

         <title>Pivotal Role of Holes in Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction on TiO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 68, Page 17213-17219, December 6, 2021. </description>

Bare TiO2 cannot conduct a photocatalytic oxidation reaction and photocatalytic CO2 reduction simultaneously, as demonstrated by Moustakas et&#8197;al. This points to a key role of holes in the CO2 reduction mechanism towards the final product CH4.







Abstract
Evidence is provided that in a gas&#8208;solid photocatalytic reaction the removal of photogenerated holes from a titania (TiO2) photocatalyst is always detrimental for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The coupling of the reaction to a sacrificial oxidation reaction hinders or entirely prohibits the formation of CH4 as a reduction product. This agrees with earlier work in which the detrimental effect of oxygen&#8208;evolving cocatalysts was demonstrated. Photocatalytic alcohol oxidation or even overall water splitting proceeds in these reaction systems, but carbon&#8208;containing products from CO2 reduction are no longer observed. H2 addition is also detrimental, either because it scavenges holes or because it is not an efficient proton donor on TiO2. The results are discussed in light of previously suggested reaction mechanisms for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The formation of CH4 from CO2 is likely not a linear sequence of reduction steps but includes oxidative elementary steps. Furthermore, new hypotheses on the origin of the required protons are suggested.

         <title>Spectral Signatures of Oxidation States in a Manganese&#8208;Oxo Cubane Water Oxidation Catalyst</title>

Tracing fingerprints. Key IR and UV/Vis spectroscopic signatures to differentiate oxidation states of the manganese&#8208;oxo vanadate catalyst [(Mn4O4)(V4O13)(OAc)3]n&#8211; are identified. During oxidation from [Mn
Mn
] to [Mn
], in the UV/Vis spectrum a band at about 570&#8197;nm increases while another one at 850&#8197;nm vanishes. In the IR spectra, oxidation leads to a remarkable shift of the V=O stretch mode to higher energies.







Abstract
We report IR and UV/Vis spectroscopic signatures that allow discriminating between the oxidation states of the manganese&#8208;based water oxidation catalyst [(Mn4O4)(V4O13)(OAc)3]3&#8722;. Simulated IR spectra show that V=O stretching vibrations in the 900&#8211;1000&#8197;cm&#8722;1 region shift consistently by about 20&#8197;cm&#8722;1 per oxidation equivalent. Multiple bands in the 1450&#8211;1550&#8197;cm&#8722;1 region also change systematically upon oxidation/reduction. The computed UV/Vis spectra predict that the spectral range above 350&#8197;nm is characteristic of the managanese&#8208;oxo cubane oxidation state, whereas transitions at higher energy are due to the vanadate ligand. The presence of absorption signals above 680&#8197;nm is indicative of the presence of MnIII atoms. Spectroelectrochemical measurements of the oxidation from [Mn
Mn
] to [Mn

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tracing fingerprints&lt;/b&gt;. Key IR and UV/Vis spectroscopic signatures to differentiate oxidation states of the manganese-oxo vanadate catalyst [(Mn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;)(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; are identified. During oxidation from [Mn
Mn
] to [Mn
], in the UV/Vis spectrum a band at about 570&#8197;nm increases while another one at 850&#8197;nm vanishes. In the IR spectra, oxidation leads to a remarkable shift of the V=O stretch mode to higher energies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report IR and UV/Vis spectroscopic signatures that allow discriminating between the oxidation states of the manganese-based water oxidation catalyst [(Mn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;)(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Simulated IR spectra show that V=O stretching vibrations in the 900&#8211;1000&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; region shift consistently by about 20&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; per oxidation equivalent. Multiple bands in the 1450&#8211;1550&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; region also change systematically upon oxidation/reduction. The computed UV/Vis spectra predict that the spectral range above 350&#8197;nm is characteristic of the managanese-oxo cubane oxidation state, whereas transitions at higher energy are due to the vanadate ligand. The presence of absorption signals above 680&#8197;nm is indicative of the presence of Mn&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; atoms. Spectroelectrochemical measurements of the oxidation from [Mn
Mn
] to [Mn
] showed that the change in oxidation state can indeed be tracked by both IR and UV/Vis spectroscopy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoredox Catalysis Using Heterogenized Iridium Complexes**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Heterogenized iridium catalysts were synthesized to generate reusable, robust photoredox catalysts. The catalyst architecture, in nanopowder or thin film forms, was studied to see how it affected the catalytic performance on three different metal oxide surfaces. Reductive dehalogenation of bromoacetophenone to acetophenone was studied as the model photoredox reaction, and all catalysts showed successful product generation. Al2O3&#8208;based catalysts were found to be the most robust and reusable catalysts in both architectures, with at least &#8764;1000 turnovers and reusable three times.







Abstract
Heterogenized photoredox catalysts provide a path for sustainable chemical synthesis using highly tunable, reusable constructs. Here, heterogenized iridium complexes as photoredox catalysts were assembled via covalent attachment to metal oxide surfaces (ITO, ZrO2, Al2O3) in thin film or nanopowder constructs. The goal was to understand which materials provided the most promising constructs for catalysis. To do this, reductive dehalogenation of bromoacetophenone to acetophenone was studied as a test reaction for system optimization. All catalyst constructs produced acetophenone with high conversions and yields with the fastest reactions complete in fifteen minutes using Al2O3 supports. The nanopowder catalysts resulted in faster and more efficient catalysis, while the thin film catalysts were more robust and easily reused. Importantly, the thin film constructs show promise for future photoelectrochemical and electrochemical photoredox setups. Finally, all catalysts were reusable 2&#8211;3 times, performing at least 1000 turnovers (Al2O3), demonstrating that heterogenized catalysts are a sustainable catalyst alternative.

         <title>Activation of Molecular O2 on CoFe2O4 (001) Surfaces: An Embedded Cluster Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 68, Page 17115-17126, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activation pathways for dioxygen on the (001) surfaces of inverse spinel CoFe2O4 were investigated using the periodic electrostatic embedded cluster model. Reduction of molecular O2 into superoxide is relatively facile, whereas the subsequent dissociation into reactive monoatomic species is associated with large energy barriers that may limit the rate of oxidation processes. Of the metal&#8208;O species, [FeIII&#8722;O]2+ is thermodynamically most stable.







Abstract
Dioxygen activation pathways on the (001) surfaces of cobalt ferrite, CoFe2O4, were investigated computationally using density functional theory and the hybrid Perdew&#8208;Burke&#8208;Ernzerhof exchange&#8208;correlation functional (PBE0) within the periodic electrostatic embedded cluster model. We considered two terminations: the A&#8208;layer exposing Fe2+ and Co2+ metal sites in tetrahedral and octahedral positions, respectively, and the B&#8208;layer exposing octahedrally coordinated Co3+. On the A&#8208;layer, molecular oxygen is chemisorbed as a superoxide on the Fe monocenter or bridging a Fe&#8722;Co cation pair, whereas on the B&#8208;layer it is adsorbed at the most stable anionic vacancy. Activation is promoted by transfer of electrons provided by the d metal centers onto the adsorbed oxygen. The subsequent dissociation of dioxygen into monoatomic species and surface reoxidation have been identified as the most critical steps that may limit the rate of the oxidation processes. Of the reactive metal&#8208;O species, [FeIII&#8722;O]2+ is thermodynamically most stable, while the oxygen of the Co&#8722;O species may easily migrate across the A&#8208;layer with barriers smaller than the associative desorption.

         <title>Supported CuII Single&#8208;Ion Catalyst for Total Carbon Utilization of C2 and C3 Biomass&#8208;Based Platform Molecules in the N&#8208;Formylation of Amines</title>

Waste not, want not: Oxidative N&#8208;formylation of amines to formamides by sustainable C2 and C3 biomass&#8208;based carbonyl sources such as glycolic acid, 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone and glyceraldehyde is catalyzed by very few CuII single sites in zeolite 5A with unprecedented 100&#8201;% utilization efficiency of carbon atoms.







Abstract
The shift from fossil carbon sources to renewable ones is vital for developing sustainable chemical processes to produce valuable chemicals. In this work, value&#8208;added formamides were synthesized in good yields by the reaction of amines with C2 and C3 biomass&#8208;based platform molecules such as glycolic acid, 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone and glyceraldehyde. These feedstocks were selectively converted by catalysts based on Cu&#8208;containing zeolite 5A through the in&#8197;situ formation of carbonyl&#8208;containing intermediates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example in which all the carbon atoms in biomass&#8208;based feedstocks could be amidated to produce formamide. Combined catalyst characterization results revealed preferably single CuII sites on the surface of Cu/5A, some of which form small clusters, but without direct linking via oxygen bridges. By combining the results of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin&#8208;trapping, operando attenuated total reflection (ATR) IR spectroscopy and control experiments, it was found that the formation of formamides might involve a HCOOH&#8208;like intermediate and .NHPh radicals, in which the selective formation of .OOH radicals might play a key role.

         <title>A Study in Red: The Overlooked Role of Azo&#8208;Moieties in Polymeric Carbon Nitride Photocatalysts with Strongly Extended Optical Absorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 68, Page 17188-17202, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
What makes it red? A novel high&#8208;temperature treatment procedure for turning the conventional melamine&#8208;derived yellow polymeric carbon nitride into a red carbon nitride is reported. Surprisingly, a detailed characterization reveals that the red colour comes from the azo&#8208;groups formed during the synthesis, a moiety whose role in shifting the optical absorption edge and photocatalytic activity of carbon nitrides more into the visible range has been overlooked so far.







Abstract
The unique optical and photoredox properties of heptazine&#8208;based polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) materials make them promising semiconductors for driving various productive photocatalytic conversions. However, their typical absorption onset at ca. 430&#8211;450&#8197;nm is still far from optimum for efficient sunlight harvesting. Despite many reports of successful attempts to extend the light absorption range of PCNs, the determination of the structural features responsible for the red shift of the light absorption edge beyond 450&#8197;nm has often been obstructed by the highly disordered structure of PCNs and/or low content of the moieties responsible for changes in optical and electronic properties. In this work, we implement a high&#8208;temperature (900&#8201;&#176;C) treatment procedure for turning the conventional melamine&#8208;derived yellow PCN into a red carbon nitride. This approach preserves the typical PCN structure but incorporates a new functionality that promotes visible light absorption. A detailed characterization of the prepared material reveals that partial heptazine fragmentation accompanied by de&#8208;ammonification leads to the formation of azo&#8208;groups in the red PCN, a chromophore moiety whose role in shifting the optical absorption edge of PCNs has been overlooked so far. These azo moieties can be activated under visible&#8208;light (470&#8197;nm) for H2 evolution even without any additional co&#8208;catalyst, but are also responsible for enhanced charge&#8208;trapping and radiative recombination, as shown by spectroscopic studies.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What makes it red&lt;/b&gt;? A novel high-temperature treatment procedure for turning the conventional melamine-derived yellow polymeric carbon nitride into a red carbon nitride is reported. Surprisingly, a detailed characterization reveals that the red colour comes from the azo-groups formed during the synthesis, a moiety whose role in shifting the optical absorption edge and photocatalytic activity of carbon nitrides more into the visible range has been overlooked so far.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unique optical and photoredox properties of heptazine-based polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) materials make them promising semiconductors for driving various productive photocatalytic conversions. However, their typical absorption onset at ca. 430&#8211;450&#8197;nm is still far from optimum for efficient sunlight harvesting. Despite many reports of successful attempts to extend the light absorption range of PCNs, the determination of the structural features responsible for the red shift of the light absorption edge beyond 450&#8197;nm has often been obstructed by the highly disordered structure of PCNs and/or low content of the moieties responsible for changes in optical and electronic properties. In this work, we implement a high-temperature (900&#8201;&#176;C) treatment procedure for turning the conventional melamine-derived yellow PCN into a red carbon nitride. This approach preserves the typical PCN structure but incorporates a new functionality that promotes visible light absorption. A detailed characterization of the prepared material reveals that partial heptazine fragmentation accompanied by de-ammonification leads to the formation of azo-groups in the red PCN, a chromophore moiety whose role in shifting the optical absorption edge of PCNs has been overlooked so far. These azo moieties can be activated under visible-light (470&#8197;nm) for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution even without any additional co-catalyst, but are also responsible for enhanced charge-trapping and radiative recombination, as shown by spectroscopic studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Shorter Alkyl Chains Enhance Molecular Diffusion and Electron Transfer Kinetics between Photosensitisers and Catalysts in CO2&#8208;Reducing Photocatalytic Liposomes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 68, Page 17203-17212, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Ru photosensitisers (RuCn) and Re catalysts (ReCn) covalently functionalised with alkyl chains of different lengths (n=9, 12, 15, 17, and 19) were immobilised on liposomes to perform photocatalytic CO2 reduction using ascorbate (HAsc&#8722;) as electron donor. A higher turnover number for CO production (TONCO) was found for systems with shorter alkyl tails, which was due to the higher mobility of the molecules on the lipid bilayer, leading to faster electron transfer between RuCn and ReCn.







Abstract
Covalent functionalisation with alkyl tails is a common method for supporting molecular catalysts and photosensitisers onto lipid bilayers, but the influence of the alkyl chain length on the photocatalytic performances of the resulting liposomes is not well understood. In this work, we first prepared a series of rhenium&#8208;based CO2&#8208;reduction catalysts [Re(4,4&#8217;&#8208;(CnH2n+1)2&#8208;bpy)(CO)3Cl] (ReCn; 4,4&#8217;&#8208;(CnH2n+1)2&#8208;bpy=4,4&#8217;&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine) and ruthenium&#8208;based photosensitisers [Ru(bpy)2(4,4&#8217;&#8208;(CnH2n+1)2&#8208;bpy)](PF6)2 (RuCn) with different alkyl chain lengths (n=0, 9, 12, 15, 17, and 19). We then prepared a series of PEGylated DPPC liposomes containing RuCn and ReCn, hereafter noted Cn, to perform photocatalytic CO2 reduction in the presence of sodium ascorbate. The photocatalytic performance of the Cn liposomes was found to depend on the alkyl tail length, as the turnover number for CO (TON) was inversely correlated to the alkyl chain length, with a more than fivefold higher CO production (TON=14.5) for the C9 liposomes, compared to C19 (TON=2.8). Based on immobilisation efficiency quantification, diffusion kinetics, and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy, we identified the main reason for this trend: two types of membrane&#8208;bound RuCn species can be found in the membrane, either deeply buried in the bilayer and diffusing slowly, or less buried with much faster diffusion kinetics. Our data suggest that the higher photocatalytic performance of the C9 system is due to the higher fraction of the more mobile and less buried molecular species, which leads to enhanced electron transfer kinetics between RuC9 and ReC9.

         <title>Strong Ligand Stabilization Based on &#960;&#8208;Extension in a Series of Ruthenium Terpyridine Water Oxidation Catalysts</title>

         <dc:description>
The correlation between the stability of a monodentate chloride ligand and the catalytic water oxidation performance of a set of ruthenium(II) terpyridine complexes based on &#960;&#8208;extension of a bipyridine is investigated. The findings are supported by theoretical calculations and show a significant dependence of the stability of the chloride ligand on the &#960;&#8208;extension and, hence, a decrease in the catalytic turnover number and turnover frequency.







Abstract
The substitution behavior of the monodentate Cl ligand of a series of ruthenium(II) terpyridine complexes (terpyridine (tpy)=2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine) has been investigated. 1H&#8197;NMR kinetic experiments of the dissociation of the chloro ligand in D2O for the complexes [Ru(tpy)(bpy)Cl]Cl (1, bpy=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine) and [Ru(tpy)(dppz)Cl]Cl (2, dppz=dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine) as well as the binuclear complex [Ru(bpy)2(tpphz)Ru(tpy)Cl]Cl3 (3&#8201;b, tpphz=tetrapyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c:3&#8242;&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;h:2&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;j]phenazine) were conducted, showing increased stability of the chloride ligand for compounds 2 and 3 due to the extended &#960;&#8208;system. Compounds 1&#8211;5 (4=[Ru(tbbpy)2(tpphz)Ru(tpy)Cl](PF6)3, 5=[Ru(bpy)2(tpphz)Ru(tpy)(C3H8OS)/(H2O)](PF6)3, tbbpy=4,4&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine) are tested for their ability to run water oxidation catalysis (WOC) using cerium(IV) as sacrificial oxidant. The WOC experiments suggest that the stability of monodentate (chloride) ligand strongly correlates to catalytic performance, which follows the trend 1&gt;2&gt;5&#8805;3&gt;4. This is also substantiated by quantum chemical calculations, which indicate a stronger binding for the chloride ligand based on the extended &#960;&#8208;systems in compounds 2 and 3. Additionally, a theoretical model of the mechanism of the oxygen evolution of compounds 1 and 2 is presented; this suggests no differences in the elementary steps of the catalytic cycle within the bpy to the dppz complex, thus suggesting that differences in the catalytic performance are indeed based on ligand stability. Due to the presence of a photosensitizer and a catalytic unit, binuclear complexes 3 and 4 were tested for photocatalytic water oxidation. The bridging ligand architecture, however, inhibits the effective electron&#8208;transfer cascade that would allow photocatalysis to run efficiently. The findings of this study can elucidate critical factors in catalyst design.

         <title>Synergistic Effects of Co and Fe on the Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity of LaCoxFe1&#8722;xO3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 68, Page 17145-17158, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linear sweep voltammetry shows a substantial decrease in the oxygen evolution reactions overpotential by Co incorporation in LaCoxFe1&#8722;xO3. Spin densities obtained from DFT+U calculations reveal not only the involvement of the Fe and Co reaction sites but also of neighboring sites.







Abstract
In a combined experimental and theoretical study we assess the role of Co incorporation on the OER activity of LaCoxFe1&#8722;xO3. Phase pure perovskites were synthesized up to 
 in 0.025/0.050 steps.

         <title>Co3O4&#8722;CeO2 Nanocomposites for Low&#8208;Temperature CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 68, Page 16947-16955, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co3O4&#8722;CeO2 nanocomposites with three different morphologies, that is, CeO2&#8208;supported Co3O4 layers, intermixed oxides, and homogeneously dispersed Co, were used for CO oxidation. Both CO&#8208;TPR and CO oxidation kinetics indicated that the layered structure exhibited the best performance for the same Co3O4 loading of 10.4&#8197;wt&#8201;%. The CO oxidation activity increased for higher Co3O4 amount, approaching activity comparable to Pt/CeO2.







Abstract
In an effort to combine the favorable catalytic properties of Co3O4 and CeO2, nanocomposites with different phase distribution and Co3O4 loading were prepared and employed for CO oxidation. Synthesizing Co3O4&#8208;modified CeO2 via three different sol&#8208;gel based routes, each with 10.4&#8197;wt&#8201;% Co3O4 loading, yielded three different nanocomposite morphologies: CeO2&#8208;supported Co3O4 layers, intermixed oxides, and homogeneously dispersed Co. The reactivity of the resulting surface oxygen species towards CO were examined by temperature programmed reduction (CO&#8208;TPR) and flow reactor kinetic tests. The first morphology exhibited the best performance due to its active Co3O4 surface layer, reducing the light&#8208;off temperature of CeO2 by about 200 &#176;C. In contrast, intermixed oxides and Co&#8208;doped CeO2 suffered from lower dispersion and organic residues, respectively. The performance of Co3O4&#8208;CeO2 nanocomposites was optimized by varying the Co3O4 loading, characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and N2 sorption (BET). The 16&#8211;65&#8197;wt&#8201;% Co3O4&#8722;CeO2 catalysts approached the conversion of 1&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt/CeO2, rendering them interesting candidates for low&#8208;temperature CO oxidation.

         <title>Polyampholytic Graft Copolymers as Matrix for TiO2/Eosin Y/[Mo3S13]2&#8722; Hybrid Materials and Light&#8208;Driven Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 68, Page 16924-16929, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tailor&#8208;made polyampholyte matrix enables effective interaction of different components in light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution reaction, in our case TiO2 nanoparticles, thiomolybdate [Mo3S13]2&#8722; clusters, and Eosin&#8197;Y as photosensitizer. Altogether, high photocatalytic activity for H2 generation under visible&#8208;light irradiation was observed for well&#8208;defined hybrid materials.







Abstract
An effective strategy to enhance the performance of inorganic semiconductors is moving towards organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials. Here, we report the design of core&#8211;shell hybrid materials based on a TiO2 core functionalized with a polyampholytic (poly(dehydroalanine)&#8208;graft&#8208;(n&#8208;propyl phosphonic acid acrylamide) shell (PDha&#8208;g&#8208;PAA@TiO2). The PDha&#8208;g&#8208;PAA shell facilitates the efficient immobilization of the photosensitizer Eosin Y (EY) and enables electronic interactions between EY and the TiO2 core. This resulted in high visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 generation. The enhanced light&#8208;driven catalytic activity is attributed to the unique core&#8211;shell design with the graft copolymer acting as bridge and facilitating electron and proton transfer, thereby also preventing the degradation of EY. Further catalytic enhancement of PDha&#8208;g&#8208;PAA@TiO2 was possible by introducing [Mo3S13]2&#8722; cluster anions as hydrogen&#8208;evolution cocatalyst. This novel design approach is an example for a multi&#8208;component system in which reactivity can in future be independently tuned by selection of the desired molecular or polymeric species.

         <dc:description>
The reactivity of iron nanoclusters (Fe&#8208;NCs) on h&#8208;BN/Rh(111) was investigated using in&#8197;situ high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and CO as a probe molecule. The hollow/edge sites were determined to be the most active sites of the clusters. Dissociation of CO was only observed on the as&#8208;prepared Fe&#8208;NCs, while no catalytic activity towards CO dissociation was found for the precovered clusters as a result of blocking of the most active sites by adatoms.







Abstract
The reactivity of iron nanocluster arrays on h&#8208;BN/Rh(111) was studied using in&#8197;situ high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The morphology and reactivity of the iron nanoclusters (Fe&#8208;NCs) were investigated by CO adsorption. On&#8208;top and hollow/edge sites were determined to be the available adsorption sites on the as&#8208;prepared Fe&#8208;NCs and CO dissociation was observed at 300&#8197;K. C&#8208; and O&#8208;precovered Fe&#8208;NCs showed no catalytic activity towards CO dissociation because the hollow/edge sites were blocked by the C and O atoms. Therefore, these adsorption sites were identified to be the most active sites of the Fe&#8208;NCs.

Interpretation of NH3&#8208;TPD results, which takes into account the temperature&#8208;induced dynamics of NH3 interaction with the active centers of CuSSZ&#8208;13 is proposed. It is based on DFT/GGA+D and first principles thermodynamic modeling of various monomeric and polymeric Cu species, segregated CuO and Br&#248;nsted acid sites. Comprehensive interpretation includes Cu reduction, its relocation and oxolation, which are concomitant with ammonia desorption.







Abstract
NH3 temperature&#8208;programmed desorption (NH3&#8208;TPD) is frequently used for probing the nature of the active sites in CuSSZ&#8208;13 zeolite for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx. Herein, we propose an interpretation of NH3&#8208;TPD results, which takes into account the temperature&#8208;induced dynamics of NH3 interaction with the active centers. It is based on a comprehensive DFT/GGA+D and first&#8208;principles thermodynamic (FPT) modeling of NH3 adsorption on single Cu2+, Cu+, [CuOH]+ centers, dimeric [Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Cu]2+, [Cu&#8208;O22&#8722;&#8208;Cu]2 species, segregated CuO nanocrystals and Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS). Theoretical TPD profiles are compared with the experimental data measured for samples of various Si/Al ratios and distribution of Al within the zeolite framework. Copper reduction, its relocation, followed by the intrazeolite olation/oxolation processes, which are concomitant with NH3 desorption, were revealed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and IR. DFT/FPT results show that the peaks in the desorption profiles cannot be assigned univocally to the particular Cu and BAS centers, since the observed low&#8208;, medium&#8208; and high&#8208;temperature desorption bands have contributions coming from several species, which dynamically change their speciation and redox states during NH3&#8208;TPD experiment. Thus, a rigorous interpretation of the NH3&#8208;TPD profiles of CuSSZ&#8208;13 in terms of the strength and concentration of the active centers of a particular type is problematic. Nonetheless, useful connections for molecular interpretation of TPD profiles can be established between the individual component peaks and the corresponding ensembles of the adsorption centers.

         <title>Quantitative Distinction between Noble Metals Located in Mesopores from Those on the External Surface</title>

         <dc:description>
Three different approaches to quantitatively distinguish the active sites on the surface of a mesoporous material from those sites located in the pores are compared. Arylphosphine probes and 31P MAS NMR spectroscopy are applied to quantify the introduced noble metals. The most promising method was to selectively fill the pores with an inert (tetraethylorthosilicate) and to subsequently quantify the accessible sites.







Abstract
We compare three methods for quantitatively distinguishing the location of noble metal (NM) particles in mesopores from those found on the external support surface. MCM&#8208;41 and SBA&#8208;15 with NM located in mesopores or on the external surface were prepared and characterized by TEM. 31P MAS NMR spectroscopy was used to quantify arylphosphines in complexes with NM. Phosphine/NM ratios drop from 2.0 to 0.2 when increasing the probe diameter from 1.08 to 1.54&#8197;nm. The reaction between NM and triphenylphosphine (TPP) within 3.0&#8197;nm MCM&#8208;41 pores takes due to confinement effects multiple weeks. In contrast, external NM react with TPP instantly. A promising method is filling the pores by using the pore volume impregnation technique with tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS). TPP loading revealed that 66&#8201;% of NMs are located on the external surface of MCM&#8208;41. The pore filling method can be used in association with any probe molecule, also for the quantification of acid sites.

         <title>The Effect of Water on the 2&#8208;Propanol Oxidation Activity of Co&#8208;Substituted LaFe1&#8722;CoxO3 Perovskites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 68, Page 17127-17144, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of water addition on 2&#8208;propanol oxidation was studied on LaFe1&#8208;xCoxO3 catalysts. After surpassing a Co content threshold (x=0.15) the effect of water on the activity at elevated temperatures is beneficial due to slower Co3+ reduction and the number of hydroxide species on the catalyst surface increased.







Abstract
Perovskites are interesting oxidation catalysts due to their chemical flexibility enabling the tuning of several properties. In this work, we synthesized LaFe1&#8722;xCoxO3 catalysts by co&#8208;precipitation and thermal decomposition, characterized them thoroughly and studied their 2&#8208;propanol oxidation activity under dry and wet conditions to bridge the knowledge gap between gas and liquid phase reactions. Transient tests showed a highly active, unstable low&#8208;temperature (LT) reaction channel in conversion profiles and a stable, less&#8208;active high&#8208;temperature (HT) channel. Cobalt incorporation had a positive effect on the activity. The effect of water was negative on the LT channel, whereas the HT channel activity was boosted for x&gt;0.15. The boost may originate from a slower deactivation rate of the Co3+ sites under wet conditions and a higher amount of hydroxide species on the surface comparing wet to dry feeds. Water addition resulted in a slower deactivation for Co&#8208;rich catalysts and higher activity in the HT channel state.

         <title>Photoinduced Water Oxidation in Chitosan Nanostructures Containing Covalently Linked RuII Chromophores and Encapsulated Iridium Oxide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 68, Page 16904-16911, December 6, 2021. </description>

Restricted environment frees up reaction: Chitosan fibers with covalently linked RuII polypyridine complexes and encapsulated IrO2 nanoparticles exhibit a remarkable quantum yield of 0.21 for photoinduced water oxidation in sacrificial schemes. The restricted environment is held responsible for accelerating electron transfer steps, which are considered to be the basis of the efficiency of the overall photocatalytic process.







Abstract
The luminophore Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy)2+ (bpy=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine; dcbpy=4,4&#8217;&#8208;dicarboxy&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine) is covalently linked to a chitosan polymer; crosslinking by tripolyphosphate produced Ru&#8208;decorated chitosan fibers (NS&#8208;RuCh), with a 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio between chitosan repeating units and RuII chromophores. The properties of the RuII compound are unperturbed by the chitosan structure, with NS&#8208;RuCh exhibiting the typical metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer (MLCT) absorption and emission bands of RuII complexes. When crosslinks are made in the presence of IrO2 nanoparticles, such species are encapsulated within the nanofibers, thus generating the IrO2&#8834;NS&#8208;RuCh system, in which both RuII photosensitizers and IrO2 water oxidation catalysts are within the nanofiber structures. NS&#8208;RuCh and IrO2&#8834;NS&#8208;RuCh have been characterized by dynamic light scattering, scanning electronic microscopy, and energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray analysis, which indicated a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio between RuII chromophores and IrO2 species. Photochemical water oxidation has been investigated by using IrO2&#8834;NS&#8208;RuCh as the chromophore/catalyst assembly and persulfate anions as the sacrificial species: photochemical water oxidation yields O2 with a quantum yield (&#934;) of 0.21, definitely higher than the &#934; obtained with a similar solution containing separated Ru(bpy)32+ and IrO2 nanoparticles (0.05) or with respect to that obtained when using NS&#8208;RuCh and &#8220;free&#8221; IrO2 nanoparticles (0.10). A fast hole&#8208;scavenging process (rate constant, 7&#215;104&#8197;s&#8722;1) involving the oxidized photosensitizer and the IrO2 catalyst within the IrO2&#8834;NS&#8208;RuCh system is behind the improved photochemical quantum yield of IrO2&#8834;NS&#8208;RuCh.

&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles (0.05) or with respect to that obtained when using NS-RuCh and &#8220;free&#8221; IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles (0.10). A fast hole-scavenging process (rate constant, 7&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) involving the oxidized photosensitizer and the IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst within the IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8834;NS-RuCh system is behind the improved photochemical quantum yield of IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8834;NS-RuCh.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interplay of Polarity and Confinement in Asymmetric Catalysis with Chiral Rh Diene Complexes in Microemulsions</title>

Doping the nanoscale confinement of microemulsions with cationic surfactants improves yield and chirality transfer in the Rh&#8208;catalyzed nucleophile additions.







Abstract
Microemulsions provide a unique opportunity to tailor the polarity and liquid confinement in asymmetric catalysis via nanoscale polar and nonpolar domains separated by a surfactant film. For chiral diene Rh complexes, the influence of counterion and surfactant film on the catalytic activity and enantioselectivity remained elusive. To explore this issue chiral norbornadiene Rh(X) complexes (X=OTf, OTs, OAc, PO2F2) were synthesized and characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography and theoretical calculations. These complexes were used in Rh&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;additions of phenylboroxine to N&#8208;tosylimine in microemulsions stabilized either exclusively by n&#8208;octyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranoside (C8G1) or a C8G1&#8208;film doped with anionic or cationic surfactants (AOT, SDS and DTAB). The Rh(OAc) complex showed the largest dependence on the composition of the microemulsion, yielding up to 59&#8201;% (90&#8201;%ee) for the surfactant film doped with 5&#8197;wt% of AOT as compared to 52&#8201;% (58&#8201;%ee) for neat C8G1 at constant surfactant concentration. Larger domains, determined by SAXS analysis, enabled further increase in yield and selectivity while the reaction rate almost remained constant according to kinetic studies.

         <title>The Effect of Interlayer Anion Grafting on Water Oxidation Electrocatalysis: A Comparative Study of Ni&#8208; and Co&#8208;Based Brucite&#8208;Type Layered Hydroxides, Layered Double Hydroxides and Hydroxynitrate Salts</title>

Grafting of interlayer anions to brucite&#8208;type layered structures impacts electrocatalytic performance. Three Ni and Co compounds are investigated: (i) brucite&#8208;type M(OH)2 (no interlayer anions), (ii) LDHs (free interlayer anions), and (iii) hydroxynitrate salts (grafted interlayer anions). Substitution of OH&#8722; by NO3&#8722; allows for larger layer separation and reduced electron density at the metal center contributing to earlier onset of OER activity.







Abstract
The urge for carbon&#8208;neutral green energy conversion and storage technologies has invoked the resurgence of interest in applying brucite&#8208;type materials as low&#8208;cost oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts in basic media. Transition metal layered hydroxides belonging to the brucite&#8208;type structure family have been shown to display remarkable electrochemical activity. Recent studies on the earth&#8208;abundant Fe3+ containing m&#246;ssbauerite and Fe3+ rich Co&#8722;Fe layered oxyhydroxide carbonates have suggested that grafted interlayer anions might play a key role in OER catalysis. To probe the effect of such interlayer anion grafting in brucite&#8208;like layered hydroxides, we report here a systematic study on the electrocatalytic performance of three distinct Ni and Co brucite&#8208;type layered structures, namely, (i) brucite&#8208;type M(OH)2 without any interlayer anions, (ii) LDHs with free interlayer anions, and (iii) hydroxynitrate salts with grafted interlayer anions. The electrochemical results indeed show that grafting has an evident impact on the electronic structure and the observed OER activity. Ni&#8208; and Co&#8208;hydroxynitrate salts with grafted anions display notably earlier formations of the electrocatalytically active species. Particularly Co&#8208;hydroxynitrate salts exhibit lower overpotentials at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (&#951;=0.34&#8197;V) and medium current densities of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (&#951;=0.40&#8197;V) compared to the corresponding brucite&#8208;type hydroxides and LDH materials.

         <title>Regioselective trans&#8208;Hydrostannation of Boron&#8208;Capped Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 68, Page 17002-17011, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peripheral: A hydrogen&#8208;bonding array in the periphery of the loaded ruthenium catalyst is the likely cause for the excellent regioselectivity observed in the hydrostannation of bench&#8208;stable alkynyl&#8208;B(aam) derivatives (aam=anthranilamido). The reaction follows a stereochemically unorthodox trans&#8208;addition mode and delivers highly versatile gem&#8208;dimetalated alkene building blocks for synthesis.







Abstract
Alkynyl&#8208;B(aam) (aam=anthranilamidato) derivatives are readily available bench&#8208;stable compounds that undergo remarkably selective reactions with Bu3SnH in the presence of [Cp*RuCl]4 as the catalyst. The addition follows a stereochemically unorthodox trans&#8208;selective course; in terms of regioselectivity, the Bu3Sn&#8208; unit is delivered with high fidelity to the C&#8208;atom of the triple bond adjacent to the boracyclic head group (&#8220;alpha,trans&#8208;addition&#8221;). This outcome is deemed to reflect a hydrogen bonding interaction between the protic &#8722;NH groups of the benzo&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;diazaborininone ring system and the polarized [Ru&#8722;Cl] bond in the loaded catalyst, which locks the substrate in place in a favorable orientation relative to the incoming reagent. The resulting isomerically (almost) pure gem&#8208;dimetalated building blocks are amenable to numerous downstream functionalizations; most remarkable is the ability to subject the &#8722;B(aam) moiety to Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross coupling without need for prior hydrolysis while keeping the adjacent Bu3Sn&#8208; group intact. Alternatively, the tin residue can be engaged in selective tin/halogen exchange without touching the boron substituent; the fact that the two &#8208;NH entities of &#8722;B(aam) do not protonate organozinc reagents and hence do not interfere with Negishi reactions of the alkenyl halides thus formed is another virtue of this so far underutilized boracycle. Overall, the ruthenium catalyzed trans&#8208;hydrostannation of alkynyl&#8208;B(aam) derivatives opens a practical gateway to isomerically pure trisubstituted alkenes of many different substitution patterns by sequential functionalization of the 1&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;1,1&#8208;heterobimetallic adducts primarily formed.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Initiated Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Olefin Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 68, Page 16978-16989, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical hydrogenation of olefins via stepwise hydrogen atom transfer (HAT&#8208;OH) is a complementary approach to alkene reduction that has attracted considerable interest in recent years. Blue light photolysis of a cobalt(II) monohydride pincer complex enabled olefin hydrogenation via photo&#8208;initiated HAT&#8208;OH. Femtosecond pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy confirmed Co&#8211;H homolysis to a three&#8208;coordinate cobalt(I) complex, which binds H2 and catalyzes thermal HAT&#8208;OH even of unactivated alkenes.

Outer&#8208;sphere radical hydrogenation of olefins proceeds via stepwise hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from transition metal hydride species to the substrate. Typical catalysts exhibit M&#8722;H bonds that are either too weak to efficiently activate H2 or too strong to reduce unactivated olefins. This contribution evaluates an alternative approach, that starts from a square&#8208;planar cobalt(II) hydride complex. Photoactivation results in Co&#8722;H bond homolysis. The three&#8208;coordinate cobalt(I) photoproduct binds H2 to give a dihydrogen complex, which is a strong hydrogen atom donor, enabling the stepwise hydrogenation of both styrenes and unactivated aliphatic olefins with H2 via HAT.

     alt="Photo-Initiated Cobalt-Catalyzed Radical Olefin Hydrogenation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Radical hydrogenation&lt;/b&gt; of olefins via stepwise hydrogen atom transfer (HAT-OH) is a complementary approach to alkene reduction that has attracted considerable interest in recent years. Blue light photolysis of a cobalt(II) monohydride pincer complex enabled olefin hydrogenation via photo-initiated HAT-OH. Femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy confirmed Co&#8211;H homolysis to a three-coordinate cobalt(I) complex, which binds H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and catalyzes thermal HAT-OH even of unactivated alkenes.

         <title>Rh(I)/(III)&#8208;N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complexes: Effect of Steric Confinement Upon Immobilization on Regio&#8208; and Stereoselectivity in the Hydrosilylation of Alkynes</title>

Novel Rh(III) pentamethylcyclopentadienyl and Rh(I) complexes containing chelating N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes have been prepared and used in the hydrosilylation of 1&#8208;alkynes. Selected catalysts were immobilized within the mesopores of SBA&#8208;15. The confinement effects either provided by the ligands or the mesoporous support have been studied and allow for hydrosilylation with &#946;(Z)&#8208;selectivity of up to 100&#8201;% with both Rh(I) and Rh(III) complexes.







Abstract
Rh(I) NHC and Rh(III) Cp* NHC complexes (Cp*=pentamethylcyclopentadienyl, NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene=pyrid&#8208;2&#8208;ylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (Py&#8722;Im), thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;ylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) are presented. Selected catalysts were selectively immobilized inside the mesopores of SBA&#8208;15 with average pore diameters of 5.0 and 6.2&#8197;nm. Together with their homogenous progenitors, the immobilized catalysts were used in the hydrosilylation of terminal alkynes. For aromatic alkynes, both the neutral and cationic Rh(I) complexes showed excellent reactivity with exclusive formation of the &#946;(E)&#8208;isomer. For aliphatic alkynes, however, selectivity of the Rh(I) complexes was low. By contrast, the neutral and cationic Rh(III) Cp* NHC complexes proved to be highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective catalysts, allowing for the formation of the thermodynamically less stable &#946;&#8208;(Z)&#8208;vinylsilane isomers at room temperature. Notably, the SBA&#8208;15 immobilized Rh(I) catalysts, in which the pore walls provide an additional confinement, showed excellent &#946;&#8208;(Z)&#8208;selectivity in the hydrosilylation of aliphatic alkynes, too. Also, in the case of 4&#8208;aminophenylacetylene, selective formation of the &#946;(Z)&#8208;isomer was observed with a neutral SBA&#8208;15 supported Rh(III) Cp* NHC complex but not with its homogenous counterpart. These are the first examples of high &#946;(Z)&#8208;selectivity in the hydrosilylation of alkynes by confinement generated upon immobilization inside mesoporous silica.

         <title>The Roles of Composition and Mesostructure of Cobalt&#8208;Based Spinel Catalysts in Oxygen Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 68, Page 17038-17048, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The particle anisotropy and cobalt content in spinel oxides is systematically varied and the impact on oxygen evolving reactions is investigated. For chemical and electrochemical water oxidation as well as H2O2 decomposition the reactivity changes with the cobalt&#8208;to&#8208;metal ratio and the degree of anisotropy. Furthermore, the importance of the interplay of redox pairs and different active sites are highlighted.







Abstract
By using the crystalline precursor decomposition approach and direct co&#8208;precipitation the composition and mesostructure of cobalt&#8208;based spinels can be controlled. A systematic substitution of cobalt with redox&#8208;active iron and redox&#8208;inactive magnesium and aluminum in a cobalt spinel with anisotropic particle morphology with a preferred 111 surface termination is presented, resulting in a substitution series including Co3O4, MgCo2O4, Co2FeO4, Co2AlO4 and CoFe2O4. The role of redox pairs in the spinels is investigated in chemical water oxidation by using ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN test), electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and H2O2 decomposition. Studying the effect of dominant surface termination, isotropic Co3O4 and CoFe2O4 catalysts with more or less spherical particles are compared to their anisotropic analogues. For CAN&#8208;test and OER, Co3+ plays the major role for high activity. In H2O2 decomposition, Co2+ reveals itself to be of major importance. Redox active cations in the structure enhance the catalytic activity in all reactions. A benefit of a predominant 111 surface termination depends on the cobalt oxidation state in the as&#8208;prepared catalysts and the investigated reaction.

Tailor&#8208;made 3D conducting polymer networks containing tetraphenylbenzidine redox units are presented as novel platform for the introduction of tunable amounts of additional functional redox species via polymer analogous click chemistry in films. An in&#8208;depth electrochemical characterization based on cyclic voltammetry shows successful covalent immobilization of the redox species within the conducting networks. Ultimately this strategy shall be extended to (photo)electrocatalytic applications which will profit from the conducting polymer matrix as solid support.







Abstract
In this manuscript we present a versatile platform for introducing functional redox species into tailor&#8208;made 3D redox polymer networks. Electrochemical characterization based on cyclic voltammetry is applied to verify the immobilization of the redox species within the conducting networks. Ultimately this strategy shall be extended to (photo)electrocatalytic applications which will profit from the conducting polymer matrix. Soluble precursor copolymers are synthesized via radical copolymerization of vinyltriphenylamine (VTPA) with chloromethylstyrene (CMS) in different ratios, whereas CMS is subsequently converted into azidomethylstyrene (AMS) to yield poly(VTPA&#8208;co&#8208;AMS) copolymers. Spin&#8208;coating of poly(VTPA&#8208;co&#8208;AMS) on gold electrodes yields thin films which are converted into stable polymer network structures by electrochemical crosslinking of the polymer chains via their pendant triphenylamine groups to yield N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetraphenylbenzidine (TPB) crosslinking points. Finally, the resulting redox&#8208;active, TPB&#8208;crosslinked films are functionalized with ethynylferrocene (EFc) as a representative redox probe using a click reaction. Main experimental tools are polarization modulation infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy and scan rate dependent cyclic voltammetry. Especially the latter proves the successful conversion and the immobilization of redox probes in the polymer matrix. The results are compared with the reference system of azide&#8208;terminated self&#8208;assembled monolayers on gold substrates, allowing to distinguish between free and immobilized EFc species.

A comparative study on chemical and photochemical water oxidation with a homologous series of di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetranuclear macrocyclic Ru(bda) complexes has shown that the catalytic efficiency of this novel class of water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) increases per Ru unit with the increasing macrocycle size, revealing the tetranuclear macrocycle as one of the best performing homogeneous WOCs.







Abstract
Two di&#8208; and tetranuclear Ru(bda) (bda: 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;6,6&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylate) macrocyclic complexes were synthesized and their catalytic activities in chemical and photochemical water oxidation investigated in a comparative manner to our previously reported trinuclear congener. Our studies have shown that the catalytic activities of this homologous series of multinuclear Ru(bda) macrocycles in homogeneous water oxidation are dependent on their size, exhibiting highest efficiencies for the largest tetranuclear catalyst. The turnover frequencies (TOFs) have increased from di&#8208; to tetranuclear macrocycles not only per catalyst molecule but more importantly also per Ru unit with TOF of 6&#8197;s&#8722;1 to 8.7&#8197;s&#8722;1 and 10.5&#8197;s&#8722;1 in chemical and 0.6&#8197;s&#8722;1 to 3.3&#8197;s&#8722;1 and 5.8&#8197;s&#8722;1 in photochemical water oxidation per Ru unit, respectively. Thus, for the first time, a clear structure&#8211;activity relationship could be established for this novel class of macrocyclic water oxidation catalysts.

         <title>Multifunctional Polyoxometalate Platforms for Supramolecular Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Evolution**
</title>

Supramolecular visible light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution by a covalently linked POM/Pt&#8208;complex is reported. Electrostatic interactions in solution between the anionic POM and a cationic Ir&#8208;based photosensitizer are utilized to enable electron&#8208;transfer and H2 evolution. Reactivity enhancement by ligand exchange on the Pt&#8208;complex is possible. Photophysical and theoretical studies shed light on the underlying reaction mechanisms.







Abstract
Multifunctional supramolecular systems are a central research topic in light&#8208;driven solar energy conversion. Here, we report a polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based supramolecular dyad, where two platinum&#8208;complex hydrogen evolution catalysts are covalently anchored to an Anderson polyoxomolybdate anion. Supramolecular electrostatic coupling of the system to an iridium photosensitizer enables visible light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution. Combined theory and experiment demonstrate the multifunctionality of the POM, which acts as photosensitizer/catalyst&#8208;binding&#8208;site[1] and facilitates light&#8208;induced charge&#8208;transfer and catalytic turnover. Chemical modification of the Pt&#8208;catalyst site leads to increased hydrogen evolution reactivity. Mechanistic studies shed light on the role of the individual components and provide a molecular understanding of the interactions which govern stability and reactivity. The system could serve as a blueprint for multifunctional polyoxometalates in energy conversion and storage.

A complex for a complex reaction: La1&#8722;xSrxCoO3 nanoparticles were prepared by spray&#8208;flame synthesis and applied in the liquid&#8208;phase oxidation of cyclohexene with molecular O2. An optimum Sr doping of 20&#8197;at.&#8201;% &#8211; with balanced amounts of oxygen vacancies and Co2+ cations &#8211; was found to be beneficial for cyclohexene conversion. In situ ATR&#8208;IR and EPR spectroscopy verified the complex radical reaction network.







Abstract
La1&#8722;xSrxCoO3 (x=0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) nanoparticles were prepared by spray&#8208;flame synthesis and applied in the liquid&#8208;phase oxidation of cyclohexene with molecular O2 as oxidant under mild conditions. The catalysts were systematically characterized by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques. With increasing Sr content, the concentration of surface oxygen vacancy defects increases, which is beneficial for cyclohexene oxidation, but the surface concentration of less active Co2+ was also increased. However, Co2+ cations have a superior activity towards peroxide decomposition, which also plays an important role in cyclohexene oxidation. A Sr doping of 20 at.&#8201;% was found to be the optimum in terms of activity and product selectivity. The catalyst also showed excellent reusability over three catalytic runs; this can be attributed to its highly stable particle size and morphology. Kinetic investigations revealed first&#8208;order reaction kinetics for temperatures between 60 and 100&#8201;&#176;C and an apparent activation energy of 68&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for cyclohexene oxidation. Moreover, the reaction was not affected by the applied O2 pressure in the range from 10 to 20&#8197;bar. In situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy was used to monitor the conversion of cyclohexene and the formation of reaction products including the key intermediate cyclohex&#8208;2&#8208;ene&#8208;1&#8208;hydroperoxide; spin trap electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy provided strong evidence for a radical reaction pathway by identifying the cyclohexenyl alkoxyl radical.

Spheres of influence: Hollow carbon nanospheres implanted in the surface plane of carbon nitride curly nanosheets were synthesized by thermal polymerization of freeze&#8208;dried urea and a NCS precursor. When the CN/NCS photocatalyst is irradiated by visible light, electron&#8208;hole pairs are generated in CN, then the electrons in the conduction bands of CN are transferred to the NCS. This results in efficient photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation with a high H2 production rate and notable quantum yield.







Abstract
A novel hybrid photocatalyst composed of hollow carbon nanospheres (NCS) and graphitic carbon nitride (CN) curly nanosheets has been prepared by the calcination of a NCS precursor and freeze&#8208;dried urea. The optimized photocatalyst exhibits an efficient photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation with a highest H2 generation rate of 3612.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, leading to an apparent quantum yield of 10.04&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm, five times higher than the widely reported benchmark photocatalyst CN (2.01&#8201;% AQY). The materials characterization shows that NCS&#8208;modified CN curly nanosheets can promote photoelectron transfer and suppress charge recombination through their special coupling interface and NCS as an electron acceptor, which significantly improves the photocatalytic efficiency. Thus, this study provides an efficient strategy for the design of highly efficient photocatalyst, particularly suitable for a totally metal&#8208;free photocatalytic system.

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved Spectroscopy and High&#8208;Efficiency Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Evolution of a {Mo3S4}&#8208;Containing Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 68, Page 17094-17103, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect between a {Mo3S4} catalytic unit and a POM electron&#8208;collecting unit gives rise to highly efficient light&#8208;driven HER photocatalysis. Such behavior is directly correlated to the very high rate constant for electron transfer from the reduced photosensitizer to the ThioPOM catalyst. Furthermore, the high stability of the catalytic system should be related to the protected {Mo3S4} cores within the dumbbell&#8208;like arrangement.







Abstract
Polyoxothiometalate ions (ThioPOM) are active hydrogen&#8208;evolution reaction (HER) catalysts based on modular assembly built from electrophilic clusters {MoSx} and vacant polyoxotungstates. Herein, the dumbbell&#8208;like anion [{(PW11O39)Mo3S4(H2O)3(OH)}2]8&#8722; exhibits very high light&#8208;driven HER activity, while the active cores {Mo3S4} do not contain any exposed disulfido ligands, which were suspected to be the origin of the HER activity. Moreover, in the catalyst architecture, the two central {Mo3S4} cores are sandwiched by two {PW11O39}7&#8722; subunits that act as oxidant&#8208;resistant protecting groups and behave as electron&#8208;collecting units. A detailed photophysical study was carried out confirming the reductive quenching mechanism of the photosensitizer [Ir(ppy)2(dtbbpy)]+ by the sacrificial donor triethanolamine (TEOA) and highlighting the very high rate constant of the electron transfer from the reduced photosensitizer to the ThioPOM catalyst. Such results provide new insights into the field of molecular catalytic systems able to promote high HER activity.

         <title>Enhancing the Catalytic Activity of MOF&#8208;808 Towards Peptide Bond Hydrolysis through Synthetic Modulations</title>

Modulating the synthesis of MOF&#8208;808 through choice of zirconium precursor directly impacts its structure and reactivity towards the hydrolysis of peptide bonds, outweighing the influence of MOF defects or particle size.







Abstract
The performance of MOFs in catalysis is largely derived from structural features, and much work has focused on introducing structural changes such as defects or ligand functionalisation to boost the reactivity of the MOF. However, the effects of different parameters chosen for the synthesis on the catalytic reactivity of the resulting MOF remains poorly understood. Here, we evaluate the role of metal precursor on the reactivity of Zr&#8208;based MOF&#8208;808 towards hydrolysis of the peptide bond in the glycylglycine model substrate. In addition, the effect of synthesis temperature and duration has been investigated. Surprisingly, the metal precursor was found to have a large influence on the reactivity of the MOF, surpassing the effect of particle size or number of defects. Additionally, we show that by careful selection of the Zr&#8208;salt precursor and temperature used in MOF syntheses, equally active MOF catalysts could be obtained after a 20&#8197;minute synthesis compared to 24&#8197;h synthesis.

         <title>A Molecular Photosensitizer in a Porous Block Copolymer Matrix&#8208;Implications for the Design of Photocatalytically Active Membranes</title>

A Ru photosensitizer covalently bound to a porous block copolymer membrane to be used in photocatalytic systems exhibits an additional charge transfer process unobserved in aprotic solvents due to protonation from water molecules absorbed in the polymer. The inhomogeneity due to different orientations of the bound photosensitizer together with its rigidity in the polymer could serve as important set screws for controlling the overall photocatalytic efficiency.







Abstract
Recently, porous photocatalytically active block copolymer membranes were introduced, based on heterogenized molecular catalysts. Here, we report the integration of the photosensitizer, i.&#8201;e., the light absorbing unit in an intermolecular photocatalytic system into block copolymer membranes in a covalent manner. We study the resulting structure and evaluate the orientational mobility of the photosensitizer as integral part of the photocatalytic system in such membranes. To this end we utilize transient absorption anisotropy, highlighting the temporal reorientation of the transition dipole moment probed in a femtosecond pump&#8208;probe experiment. Our findings indicate that the photosensitizer is rigidly bound to the polymer membrane and shows a large heterogeneity of absolute anisotropy values as a function of location probed within the matrix. This reflects the sample inhomogeneity arising from different protonation states of the photosensitizer and different intermolecular interactions of the photosensitizers within the block copolymer membrane scaffold.

Covalent functionalization of Anderson&#8208;polyoxometalates with BODIPY light&#8208;absorbers using CLICK chemistry is reported. The resulting photosensitizer&#8208;polyoxometalate dyads are characterized by photophysical and theoretical methods, highlighting the electronic interactions between the sub&#8208;components, and their possible application in visible light&#8208;driven chemistry.







Abstract
The covalent attachment of molecular photosensitizers (PS) to polyoxometalates (POMs) opens new pathways to PS&#8208;POM dyads for light&#8208;driven charge&#8208;transfer and charge&#8208;storage. Here, we report a synthetic route for the covalent linkage of BODIPY&#8208;dyes to Anderson&#8208;type polyoxomolybdates by using CLICK chemistry (i.&#8201;e. copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition, CuAAC). Photophysical properties of the dyad were investigated by combined experimental and theoretical methods and highlight the role of both sub&#8208;components for the charge&#8208;separation properties. The study demonstrates how CLICK chemistry can be used for the versatile linkage of organic functional units to molecular metal oxide clusters.

Here, we report a synthetic route for the covalent linkage of BODIPY-dyes to Anderson-type polyoxomolybdates by using CLICK chemistry (i.&#8201;e. copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition, CuAAC). Photophysical properties of the dyad were investigated by combined experimental and theoretical methods and highlight the role of both sub-components for the charge-separation properties. The study demonstrates how CLICK chemistry can be used for the versatile linkage of organic functional units to molecular metal oxide clusters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Differentiation of Epoxide Enantiomers in the Confined Spaces of an Homochiral Cu(II) Metal&#8208;Organic Framework by Kinetic Resolution</title>

The homochiral metal&#8208;organic framework TAMOF&#8208;1 was used as a heterogeneous catalyst in the kinetic resolution of styrene oxide by ring opening reactions with anilines. The linear products underwent a second KR resulting in an amplification of the final stereoselectivity (subtractive Horeau amplification effect). Computational studies rationalized the two successive KR while providing a deep understanding of the process.







Abstract
TAMOF&#8208;1, a homochiral metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) constructed from an amino acid derivative and Cu(II), was investigated as a heterogeneous catalyst in kinetic resolutions involving the ring opening of styrene oxide with a set of anilines. The branched products generated from the ring opening of styrene oxide with anilines and the unreacted epoxide were obtained with moderately high enantiomeric excesses. The linear product arising from the attack on the non&#8208;benzylic position of styrene oxide underwent a second kinetic resolution by reacting with the epoxide, resulting in an amplification of its final enantiomeric excess and a concomitant formation of an array of isomeric aminodiols. Computational studies confirmed the experimental results, providing a deep understanding of the whole process involving the two successive kinetic resolutions. Furthermore, TAMOF&#8208;1 activity was conserved after several catalytic cycles. The ring opening of a meso&#8208;epoxide with aniline catalyzed by TAMOF&#8208;1 was also studied and moderate enantioselectivities were obtained.

         <title>Coupling of photoactive transition metal complexes to a functional polymer matrix**
</title>

         <dc:description>
The integration of molecular light&#8208;driven catalyst into a polymer matrix allows to tailor photochemical devices as the embedding can give control over charge transfer processes, photochemical reactivity and degradation resistance. Combining periodic and local quantum chemical approaches, we elucidate the electronic coupling between a polymer and a photosensitive complex, which is a prerequisite for a rational tailoring of such systems. Thus, we identify possible routes towards photoinduced excitations that could trigger catalytic reactions at metal centers attached to the photosensitizer.







Abstract
Conductive polymers represent a promising alternative to semiconducting oxide electrodes typically used in dye&#8208;sensitized cathodes as they more easily allow a tuning of the physicochemical properties. This can then also be very beneficial for using them in light&#8208;driven catalysis. In this computational study, we address the coupling of Ru&#8208;based photosensitizers to a polymer matrix by combining two different first&#8208;principles electronic structure approaches. We use a periodic density functional theory code to properly account for the delocalized nature of the electronic states in the polymer. These ground state investigations are complemented by time&#8208;dependent density functional theory simulations to assess the Franck&#8208;Condon photophysics of the present photoactive hybrid material based on a molecular model system. Our results are consistent with recent experimental observations and allow to elucidate the light&#8208;driven redox chemical processes &#8211; eventually leading to charge separation &#8211; in the present functional hybrid systems with potential application as photocathode materials.

         <title>Cobaloxime Complex Salts: Synthesis, Patterning on Carbon Nanomembranes and Heterogeneous Hydrogen Evolution Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 68, Page 16896-16903, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of a new cobaloxime&#8208;based double complex salt and its use as a catalyst for the homogeneous and heterogeneous, light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We successfully deposited these catalysts by scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) on supported and free&#8208;standing 2D amino&#8208;terminated carbon nanomembranes (CNMs) and quantified hydrogen by using Pd microsensors.







Abstract
Cobaloximes are promising, earth&#8208;abundant catalysts for the light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Typically, these cobalt(III) complexes are prepared in&#8197;situ or employed in their neutral form, for example, [Co(dmgH)2(py)Cl], even though related complex salts have been reported previously and could, in principle, offer improved catalytic activity as well as more efficient immobilization on solid support. Herein, we report an interdisciplinary investigation into complex salts [Co(dmgH)2(py)2]+[Co(dmgBPh2)2Cl2]&#8722;, 
 and [Co(dmgH)2(py)2]+BArF&#8722;. We describe their strategic syntheses from the commercially available complex [Co(dmgH)2(py)Cl] and demonstrate that these double and single complex salts are potent catalysts for the light&#8208;driven HER. We also show that scanning electrochemical cell microscopy can be used to deposit arrays of catalysts [Co(dmgH)2(py)2]+[Co(dmgBPh2)2Cl2]&#8722;, 
 and [Co(dmgH)2(py)Cl] on supported and free&#8208;standing amino&#8208;terminated &#8764;1&#8208;nm&#8208;thick carbon nanomembranes (CNMs). Photocatalytic H2 evolution at such arrays was quantified with Pd microsensors by scanning electrochemical microscopy, thus providing a new approach for catalytic evaluation and opening up novel routes for the creation and analysis of &#8220;designer catalyst arrays&#8221;, nanoprinted in a desired pattern on a solid support.

         <title>Jahn&#8208;Teller Effects in a Vanadate&#8208;Stabilized Manganese&#8208;Oxo Cubane Water Oxidation Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 68, Page 17066-17077, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Jahn&#8208;Teller effects in the manganese&#8208;oxo vanadate catalyst [(Mn4O4)(V4O13)(OAc)3]n&#8722; and its activated form [(Mn4O4)(V4O13)(OAc)2(H2)(OH)]n&#8722; lead to a many local minima for different oxidation states and enhance the catalyst's reactivity.







Abstract
Heuristic rules that allow identifying the preferred mixed&#8208;valence isomers and Jahn&#8208;Teller axis arrangements in the water oxidation catalyst [(Mn4O4)(V4O13)(OAc)3]n&#8722; and its activated form [(Mn4O4)(V4O13)(OAc)2(H2O)(OH)]n&#8722; are derived. These rules are based on computing all combinatorially possible mixed&#8208;valence isomers and Jahn&#8208;Teller axis arrangements of the MnIII atoms, and associate energetic costs with some structural features, like crossings of multiple Jahn&#8208;Teller axes, the location of these axes, or the involved ligands. It is found that the different oxidation states localize on different Mn centers, giving rise to clear Jahn&#8208;Teller distortions, unlike in previous crystallographic findings where an apparent valence delocalization was found. The low barriers that connect different Jahn&#8208;Teller axis arrangements suggest that the system quickly interconverts between them, leading to the observation of averaged bond lengths in the crystal structure. We conclude that the combination of cubane&#8208;vanadate bonds that are chemically inert, cubane&#8208;acetate/water bonds that can be activated through a Jahn&#8208;Teller axis, and low activation barriers for intramolecular rearrangement of the Jahn&#8208;Teller axes plays an essential role in the reactivity of this and probably related compounds.

These rules are based on computing all combinatorially possible mixed-valence isomers and Jahn-Teller axis arrangements of the Mn&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; atoms, and associate energetic costs with some structural features, like crossings of multiple Jahn-Teller axes, the location of these axes, or the involved ligands. It is found that the different oxidation states localize on different Mn centers, giving rise to clear Jahn-Teller distortions, unlike in previous crystallographic findings where an apparent valence delocalization was found. The low barriers that connect different Jahn-Teller axis arrangements suggest that the system quickly interconverts between them, leading to the observation of averaged bond lengths in the crystal structure. We conclude that the combination of cubane-vanadate bonds that are chemically inert, cubane-acetate/water bonds that can be activated through a Jahn-Teller axis, and low activation barriers for intramolecular rearrangement of the Jahn-Teller axes plays an essential role in the reactivity of this and probably related compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cover Feature: Hollow Carbon Sphere&#8208;Modified Graphitic Carbon Nitride for Efficient Photocatalytic H2 Production (Chem. Eur. J. 68/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 68, Page 16803-16803, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow carbon sphere&#8211;implanted graphitic carbon nitride nanosheet photocatalysts were prepared by a bottom&#8208;up method. The photocatalysts promote photoelectron transfer and suppress charge recombination through special interface coupling and hollow carbon spheres as an electron acceptor, leading to remarkably improved photocatalytic efficiency. This work thus provides an efficient pathway for the design of efficient and low&#8208;cost cocatalysts for photocatalysis. More information can be found in the Full Paper by D.&#8197;Jing, J.&#8197;Tang et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102330).

         <title>Cover Feature: Photoinduced Water Oxidation in Chitosan Nanostructures Containing Covalently Linked RuII Chromophores and Encapsulated Iridium Oxide Nanoparticles (Chem. Eur. J. 68/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 68, Page 16806-16806, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fiber gels made of Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;decorated chitosan and incorporating IrO2 nanoparticles (see SEM image in the background) can effectively perform photoinduced water oxidation with better performance than isolated components. In particular, a significantly higher quantum yield for water oxidation and a better stability of the system are reported.

Upgrading biomass without waste: Scientists from Rostock and Lanzhou have, for the first time, succeeded in directly converting C2&#8722;C3 biomass molecules with amines and H2O2 to industrially important formamides by valorizing all carbon atoms of the substrates without producing undesired by&#8208;products. The reaction is catalyzed under very mild conditions by a 5A zeolite with active CuII single sites; .NHPh and .OOH radicals play a key role.

Water oxidation catalysis on a series of ruthenium(II) terpyridine complexes shows a correlation between catalytic performance and the extension of their &#960; bidentate ligand. Substitution of the Cl&#8722; ligand by H2O reveals increased stability of the Ru&#8722;Cl bond upon increasing the &#960;&#8208;system. Computational studies demonstrated how the greater stability of the Cl&#8722; ligand negatively influences O2 evolution despite the reaction energy barriers of water oxidation being identical among all complexes. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Gr&#228;fe, L. Gonz&#225;lez, S. Rau, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102905).

         <title>Frontispiece: Interplay of Polarity and Confinement in Asymmetric Catalysis with Chiral Rh Diene Complexes in Microemulsions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 68, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of anionic and cationic co&#8208;surfactants in nonionic microemulsions on the performance of chiral Rh&#8208;norbornadiene complexes with different counterions in the 1,2&#8208;addition of phenylboronic acids to N&#8208;tosylimines is described. Catalytic studies revealed the unique role of the counterion and the type of co&#8208;surfactant. NMR experiments and the calculated intrinsic binding orbitals suggest that the anion exchange with co&#8208;surfactant accelerates the formation of the catalytically active Rh&#8208;OH complex, thus increasing the yield and affecting the enantioselectivity. For more information, see the Full Paper by M. Kirchhof, K. Abitaev and co&#8208;workers on page 16853&#8197;ff.

         <dc:description>
In the processes for synthesis of fine chemicals, selective oxidation of alcohols, especially the higher ones, is of great importance. In this regard, heterogeneous catalysts have been applied in different approaches namely, thermocatalysis, electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. Metal&#8208; and oxide&#8208;based catalysts have been used within these approaches, and despite of advances in the preparation of efficient, there is still a lack of understanding about their dynamics considering the complexity of the catalysts&#8217; surfaces and the mechanism of the reactions. Therefore, it is essential to unravel these properties using advanced operando characterization. In this mini&#8208;review, we gathered some of more important works in the field with the aim to give a perspective on the existing challenges needed to provide a fundamental understanding of the catalysts under different reaction conditions. For more information, see the Minireview by S. Najafishirtari, M. Behrens et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;16809.

The liquid&#8208;phase oxidation of cyclohexene was studied over a series of Sr&#8208;substituted La1&#8722;xSrxCoO3 catalysts of perovskite structure under mild reaction conditions with O2 as oxidant in an autoclave. The substitution of Sr into the perovskite structure led to the formation of catalytically active oxygen species. In&#8208;situ ATR IR measurements provided a comprehensive insight into the reaction mechanism under oxidation reaction conditions. More information can be found in the Full Paper by H. Wiggers, B.

         <title>A Perspective on Heterogeneous Catalysts for the Selective Oxidation of Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 68, Page 16809-16833, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metals and oxides are two important types of heterogeneous catalysts applied in selective alcohol oxidation under thermal, electrocatalytic and photocatalytic conditions. Considering the intrinsic differences in these methods, different approaches exist to prepare the catalysts and study them under such reaction conditions. In this minireview, important advances and the remaining challenges for more in&#8208;depth characterization of the above&#8208;mentioned catalysts are described to provide a perspective for future works in the field of selective alcohol oxidation.







Abstract
Selective oxidation of higher alcohols using heterogeneous catalysts is an important reaction in the synthesis of fine chemicals with added value. Though the process for primary alcohol oxidation is industrially established, there is still a lack of fundamental understanding considering the complexity of the catalysts and their dynamics under reaction conditions, especially when higher alcohols and liquid&#8208;phase reaction media are involved. Additionally, new materials should be developed offering higher activity, selectivity, and stability. This can be achieved by unraveling the structure&#8211;performance correlations of these catalysts under reaction conditions. In this regard, researchers are encouraged to develop more advanced characterization techniques to address the complex interplay between the solid surface, the dissolved reactants, and the solvent. In this mini&#8208;review, we report some of the most important approaches taken in the field and give a perspective on how to tackle the complex challenges for different approaches in alcohol oxidation while providing insight into the remaining challenges.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Metals and oxides&lt;/b&gt; are two important types of heterogeneous catalysts applied in selective alcohol oxidation under thermal, electrocatalytic and photocatalytic conditions. Considering the intrinsic differences in these methods, different approaches exist to prepare the catalysts and study them under such reaction conditions. In this minireview, important advances and the remaining challenges for more in-depth characterization of the above-mentioned catalysts are described to provide a perspective for future works in the field of selective alcohol oxidation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selective oxidation of higher alcohols using heterogeneous catalysts is an important reaction in the synthesis of fine chemicals with added value. Though the process for primary alcohol oxidation is industrially established, there is still a lack of fundamental understanding considering the complexity of the catalysts and their dynamics under reaction conditions, especially when higher alcohols and liquid-phase reaction media are involved. Additionally, new materials should be developed offering higher activity, selectivity, and stability. This can be achieved by unraveling the structure&#8211;performance correlations of these catalysts under reaction conditions. In this regard, researchers are encouraged to develop more advanced characterization techniques to address the complex interplay between the solid surface, the dissolved reactants, and the solvent. In this mini-review, we report some of the most important approaches taken in the field and give a perspective on how to tackle the complex challenges for different approaches in alcohol oxidation while providing insight into the remaining challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Walter Reppe Revival &#8211; Identification and Genesis of Copper Acetylides Cu2C2 as Active Species in Ethynylation Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>
Copper acetylides, Cu2C2, have been proposed as catalytically active species in reactions with acetylene by Walter Reppe decades ago. The present study succeeded for the first time with the doubtless experimental identification of the explosive material as active species in the ethynylation of formaldehyde to 1,4&#8208;butynediol by correlation with the performance of supported Cu/Bi/SiO2 and bulk Cu2C2 catalysts.







Abstract
More than six decades after proposing copper acetylide, Cu2C2, as catalytically active species in ethynylation reactions by Walter Reppe, the explosive species have been experimentally identified and investigated during catalysis in detail now. Taking into account specific safety precautions, unequivocal qualitative characterization was achieved by Raman spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray powder diffraction of supported copper catalysts Cu/Bi/SiO2 during and after activation and catalysis in comparison to bulk Cu2C2 materials. Quantification of Cu2C2 succeeded by thermal analysis and Raman spectroscopy. Its formation in aqueous suspension is studied starting from copper(II) oxide catalysts including dissolution, reduction and precipitation steps. Copper acetylide formation can be correlated with catalytic performance in the ethynylation of formaldehyde to 1,4&#8208;butynediol.

         <title>Switching the Mechanism of NADH Photooxidation by Supramolecular Interactions</title>

         <dc:description>
A ruthenium polypyridine complex bearing a large planar ligand sphere is capable to preorganize naturally occurring nicotinamides via their adenine moiety. This allows the complex to achieve unexpectedly high catalytic activity in the selective photooxidation of these nicotinamides by following a direct electron transfer mechanism. Reference complexes not being equipped with a suitable ligand&#8208;based nicotinamide binding sphere oxidize these cofactors via 1O2 sensitation instead.







Abstract
A series of three Ru(II) polypyridine complexes was investigated for the selective photocatalytic oxidation of NAD(P)H to NAD(P)+ in water. A combination of (time&#8208;resolved) spectroscopic studies and photocatalysis experiments revealed that ligand design can be used to control the mechanism of the photooxidation: For prototypical Ru(II) complexes a 1O2 pathway was found. Rudppz ([(tbbpy)2Ru(dppz)]Cl2, tbbpy=4,4'&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2'&#8208;bipyridine, dppz=dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine), instead, initiated the cofactor oxidation by electron transfer from NAD(P)H enabled by supramolecular binding between substrate and catalyst. Expulsion of the photoproduct NAD(P)+ from the supramolecular binding site in Rudppz allowed very efficient turnover. Therefore, Rudppz permits repetitive selective assembly and oxidative conversion of reduced naturally occurring nicotinamides by recognizing the redox state of the cofactor under formation of H2O2 as additional product. This photocatalytic process can fuel discontinuous photobiocatalysis.

         <title>Bulk Mn2+ Doped 1D Hybrid Lead Halide Perovskite with Highly Efficient, Tunable and Stable Broadband Light Emissions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mn2+&#160;doped colloidal three&#8208;dimensional (3D) lead halide perovskite nanocrystal (PNC) has&#160;attracted intensive research attention, however, the low exciton binding energy and fatal optical instability of 3D PNC seriously hinder the optoelectronic application. Therefore, it remains significant to explore new stable host perovskite with strongly bound exciton to realize more desirable luminescent property. In this work, we utilized bulk one&#8208;dimensional (1D) hybrid perovskite of [AEP]PbBr5&#8729;H2O (AEP = N&#8208;aminoethylpiperazine) as structural platform to rationally optimize the luminescent property by controllable Mn2+&#160;doping strategy. Significantly, the serial Mn2+&#8208;doped 1D [AEP]PbBr5&#8729;H2O show enhanced energy transfer efficiency from the strongly bound excitons of host material to 3d&#160;electrons of Mn2+&#160;ions, resulting in tunable broadband light emissions from weak yellow to strong red spectral range&#160;with highest photoluminescence quantum yield up to 28.41%. More importantly, these Mn2+&#8208;doped 1D perovskites display ultrahigh structural and optical stabilities in humid atmosphere, water and high temperature exceeding the conventional 3D PNC. Combined highly efficient, tunable and stable broadband light emissions enable Mn2+&#8208;doped 1D perovskite as excellent down&#8208;converting phosphor showcasing the potential application in white light emitting diode. This work not only provides a profound understanding of low&#8208;dimensional perovskites but also opens a new way to rationally design high&#8208;performance broadband light emitting perovskites for solid&#8208;state lighting and displaying devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrodeposition of Defect&#8208;rich Ternary NiCoFe Layered Double Hydroxides: Fine Modulation of Co3+ for Highly Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;abundance and durable layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been considered as promising electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the easy agglomeration of lamellar LDHs in the aqueous phase limits their practical applications. Herein, a series of ternary NiCoFe LDHs were successfully fabricated on nickel foam (NF)  via  a simple electrodeposition method. The as&#8208;prepared Ni(Co  0.5  Fe  0.5  )/NF displayed an unique nanoarray structural feature. It showed an OER overpotential of 209 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  in alkaline solution, which was superior to most systems reported so far. As evidenced by the XPS and XAFS results, such excellent performance of Ni(Co  0.5  Fe  0.5  )/NF was attributed to the higher Co  3+  /Co  2+  ratio and more defects exposed, comparing with Ni(Co  0.5  Fe  0.5  )&#8208;bulk and Ni(Co  0.5  Fe  0.5  )&#8208;mono LDHs prepared by conventional coprecipitation method. Furthermore, the ratio of Co to Fe could significantly tune the Co electronic structure of Ni(Co  x  Fe  1&#8208;x  )/NF composites (x = 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75) and affect the electrocatalytic activity for OER, in which Ni(Co  0.5  Fe  0.5  )/NF showed the lowest energy barrier for OER rate&#8208;determining step (from O* to OOH*). This work proposes a facile method to develop high&#8208;efficiency OER electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

Abstract
Examination of the reactions of &#963;&#8208;type quinolinium&#8208;based triradicals with cyclohexane in the gas phase demonstrated that the radical site that is the least strongly coupled to the other two radical sites reacts first, independent of the intrinsic reactivity of this radical site, in contrast to related biradicals that first react at the most electron&#8208;deficient radical site. Abstraction of one or two H atoms and formation of an ion that formally corresponds to a combination of the ion and cyclohexane accompanied by elimination of a H atom (&#8220;addition&#8208;H&#8221;) were observed. In all cases except one, the most reactive radical site of the triradicals is intrinsically less reactive than the other two radical sites. The product complex of the first H atom abstraction either dissociates to give the H&#8208;atom&#8208;abstraction product and the cyclohexyl radical or the more reactive radical site in the produced biradical abstracts a H atom from the cyclohexyl radical. The monoradical product sometimes adds to cyclohexene followed by elimination of a H atom, generating the &#8220;addition&#8208;H&#8221; products. Similar reaction efficiencies were measured for three of the triradicals as for relevant monoradicals. Surprisingly, the remaining three triradicals (all containing a meta&#8208;pyridyne moiety) reacted substantially faster than the relevant monoradicals. This is likely due to the exothermic generation of a meta&#8208;pyridyne analog that has enough energy to attain the dehydrocarbon atom separation common for H&#8208;atom&#8208;abstraction transition states of protonated meta&#8208;pyridynes.

         <title>Nanostructured Manganese Oxides within a Ring&#8208;Shaped Polyoxometalate Exhibiting Unusual Oxidation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanosized manganese oxides have recently received considerable attention for their synthesis, structures, and potential applications. Although various synthetic methods have been developed, precise synthesis of novel nanostructured manganese oxides are still challenging. In this study, using a structurally defined nanosized cavity inside a ring&#8208;shaped polyoxometalate, we succeeded in synthesizing two types of discrete 18 and 20 nuclear nanostructured manganese oxides,  Mn18  and  Mn20  , respectively. In particular,  Mn18  showed much higher catalytic activity than other manganese oxides for the oxygenation of alkylarenes including electron&#8208;deficient ones, and the reaction proceeded through a unique reaction mechanism due to its unusual manganese oxide structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Micro&#8208;mesoporous carbons from cyclodextrin nanosponges enabling high capacity silicon anodes and sulfur cathodes for lithiated Si&#8208;S batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manufactured globally on industrial scale, cyclodextrins (CD) are cyclic oligosaccharides produced by enzymatic conversion of starch. We daily use CD as unseen components of food, cosmetics, textiles and pharmaceutical excipients. The synthesis of active material composites from CD resources can enable or enlarge the effective utilization of these products in the battery industry with some economical as well as environmental benefits. New and simple strategies are here presented for the synthesis of nanostructured silicon and sulfur composite materials with carbonized hyper cross&#8208;linked CD (nanosponges) that show satisfactory performance as high capacity electrodes. For the sulfur cathode, the mesoporous carbon host strengthens the interaction with sulfur and limits polysulfide dissolution and shuttle effects. The embedding of silicon nanoparticles into the carbonized nanosponge allows to achieve high capacity and excellent cycling performance. Moreover, due to the high surface area of the silicon composite, the characteristics at the electrode/electrolyte interface dominate the overall electrochemical reversibility, opening a detailed analysis on the behavior of the material in different electrolytes. Finally, an integration of the Si/C and S/C composites is proposed to achieve a complete lithiated Si&#8208;S cell.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and functional analysis of bacterial sulfonosphingolipids and rosette&#8208;inducing factor 2 (RIF&#8208;2) by mass spectrometry&#8208;guided isolation and total synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We analyzed the abundance of bacterial sulfonosphingolipids, including rosette&#8208;inducing (RIFs) factors, in seven bacterial prey strains using high&#8208;resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HRMS  2  ) and molecular networking (MN) within the Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) web platform. Isolation and structure elucidation of six sulfonosphingolipids resembling RIFs was accomplished based on comparative MS and NMR studies. Here, we also report the first total synthesis of two RIF&#8208;2 diastereomers and one congener in 15 and eight synthetic steps, respectively. For the total synthesis of RIF&#8208;2 congeners, we employed a decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reaction to synthesize the necessary branched a&#8211;hydroxy fatty acids, and the Garner&#8208;aldehyde approach to generate the capnine base carrying three stereogenic centers. Bioactivity studies in the choanoflagellate  Salpingoeca rosetta  revealed that rosette inducing activity of RIFs is inhibited dose&#8208;dependently by the co&#8208;occuring sulfonosphingolipid sulfobacin D and F and that activity of RIFs is specific for isolates obtained from  Algoriphagus  .</dc:description>

         <title>H2S Dosimetry by CuO: Towards Stable Sensors by Unravelling the Underlying Solid&#8208;State Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper(II)oxide and copper(II)sulfide nanostructures are prepared for a detailed investigation of the dosimetric sensing mechanism of hydrogensulfide, aiming at an improvement of the long&#8208;term stability of these sensors. Based on the received insights a long&#8208;term stability in more than 250 sensing and regeneration cycles is achieved.







Abstract
The precise detection of the toxic gas H2S requires reliable sensitivity and specificity of sensors even at minute concentrations of as low as 10&#8197;ppm, the value corresponding to typical exposure limits. CuO can be used for H2S dosimetry, based on the formation of conductive CuS and the concomitant significant increase in conductance. In theory, at elevated temperature the reaction is reversed and CuO is formed, ideally enabling repeated and long&#8208;term use of one sensor. Yet, the performance of CuO tends to drop upon cycling. Utilizing defined CuO nanorods we thoroughly elucidated the associated detrimental chemical changes directly on the sensors, by Raman and electron microscopy analysis of each step during sensing (CuO&#8594;CuS) and regeneration (CuS&#8594;CuO) cycles. We find the decrease in the sensing performance is mainly caused by the irreversible formation of CuSO4 during regeneration. The findings allowed us to develop strategies to reduce CuSO4 formation and thus to substantially maintain the sensing stability even for repeated cycles. We achieved CuO&#8208;based dosimeters possessing a response time of a few minutes only, even for 10&#8197;ppm H2S, and prolonged life&#8208;time.

         <title>N&#8208;Aryl and N&#8208;Alkyl Carbamates from 1 Atmosphere of CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have isolated and analyzed the reactivity of the key intermediate 1 formed during the Zn(OAc)2/phen&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of organic carbamates starting from amines, CO2, and Si(OMe)4. The reaction mechanism was analyzed by using DFT. The catalytic system was modified and various N&#8208;aryl and N&#8208;alkyl carbamates that could be used as industrially important polyurethane raw materials were synthesized by using atmospheric CO2.







Abstract
We have successfully isolated and characterized the zinc carbamate complex (phen)Zn(OAc)(OC(=O)NHPh) (1; phen=1,10&#8208;phenanthroline), formed as an intermediate during the Zn(OAc)2/phen&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of organic carbamates from CO2, amines, and the reusable reactant Si(OMe)4. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the direct reaction of 1 with Si(OMe)4 proceeds via a five&#8208;coordinate silicon intermediate, forming organic carbamates. Based on these results, the catalytic system was improved by using Si(OMe)4 as the reaction solvent and additives like KOMe and KF, which promote the formation of the five&#8208;coordinated silicon species. This sustainable and effective method can be used to synthesize various N&#8208;aryl and N&#8208;alkyl carbamates, including industrially important polyurethane raw materials, starting from CO2 under atmospheric pressure.

         <title>Relationship Between Molecular Structure, Single crystal Packing and Self&#8208;Assembly Behavior: A Case Based on Pyrene Imide Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of n&#8208;type organic semiconductor materials based on pyrene imide were successfully synthesized. These materials showed different self&#8208;assembly morphologies with different conjugation degree or alkyl group. Single&#8208;crystal packing revealed that the change of molecular structure would affect certain crystal lattice parameter, such as intermolecular distance, which would further result in different self&#8208;assembly morphology.







Abstract
Development of new n&#8208;type one&#8208;dimensional (1D) self&#8208;assembly nanostructure and a clear understanding of the relationship between molecular structure and self&#8208;assembly behavior are important prerequisites for further designing and optimizing organic optoelectronic nanodevice. In this article, a series of n&#8208;type organic semiconductor materials based on pyrene imide were successfully synthesized through [4+2] cycloaddition reactions and their preliminary optical and electrochemical properties were studied. The simulated HOMO&#8208;LUMO bandgaps via DFT tallied with the experimental data well. The self&#8208;assembly of these materials showed needle or fiber&#8208;like morphologies, indicating that different conjugation degree or alkyl group had significant influence on their self&#8208;assembly behaviors. Furthermore, the single&#8208;crystal packing for these molecules were analyzed and it was found out that the changes of conjugated backbone and functional group would affect certain crystal lattice parameter significantly, such as the intermolecular packing distance and crystal size etc, which would further result in different self&#8208;assembly morphology.

         <title>Incorporation of &#946;&#8208;Alanine in Cu(II) ATCUN Peptide Complexes Increases ROS Levels, DNA Cleavage and Antiproliferative Activity**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Generation of reactive oxygen species was achieved with a redox&#8208;silent Cu(II) ATCUN complex by replacing the &#945;&#8208;amino acid glycine with &#946;&#8208;alanine. Increased ROS production led to higher oxidative DNA cleavage activity. The reasons for this higher activity were elucidated via potentiometry, cyclic voltammetry, EPR, UV/VIS spectroscopy and DFT. In cytotoxicity assays, &#946;&#8208;alanine peptide complexes showed lower IC50 values in several cancer cell lines compared with the glycine analogs, which could be correlated with the amounts of Cu taken up by cells.







Abstract
Redox&#8208;active Cu(II) complexes are able to form reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of oxygen and reducing agents. Recently, Faller et&#8197;al. reported that ROS generation by Cu(II) ATCUN complexes is not as high as assumed for decades. High complex stability results in silencing of the Cu(II)/Cu(I) redox cycle and therefore leads to low ROS generation. In this work, we demonstrate that an exchange of the &#945;&#8208;amino acid Gly with the &#946;&#8208;amino acid &#946;&#8208;Ala at position 2 (Gly2&#8594;&#946;&#8208;Ala2) of the ATCUN motif reinstates ROS production (&#8226;OH and H2O2). Potentiometry, cyclic voltammetry, EPR spectroscopy and DFT simulations were utilized to explain the increased ROS generation of these &#946;&#8208;Ala2&#8208;containing ATCUN complexes. We also observed enhanced oxidative cleavage activity towards plasmid DNA for &#946;&#8208;Ala2 compared to the Gly2 complexes. Modifications with positively charged Lys residues increased the DNA affinity through electrostatic interactions as determined by UV/VIS, fluorescence, and CD spectroscopy, and consequently led to a further increase in nuclease activity. A similar trend was observed regarding the cytotoxic activity of the complexes against several human cancer cell lines where &#946;&#8208;Ala2 peptide complexes had lower IC50 values compared to Gly2. The higher cytotoxicity could be attributed to an increased cellular uptake as determined by ICP&#8208;MS measurements.

Forced into proximity: The 4&#8208;anilino&#8208;5&#8208;fluoroquinazoline scaffold is introduced as a model system for the characterization of the weak NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F hydrogen bonding interaction. A combination of experimental (NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography) and theoretical (DFT with NBO, NCI) techniques, together with systematic structural variations, provides insights into the nature of this interaction. Selective modulation of the strength of the intramolecular NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F interaction is demonstrated through electronic substituent effects.







Abstract
The 4&#8208;anilino&#8208;6,7&#8208;ethylenedioxy&#8208;5&#8208;fluoroquinazoline scaffold is presented as a novel model system for the characterization of the weak NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F hydrogen bonding (HB) interaction. In this scaffold, the aniline NH proton is forced into close proximity with the nearby fluorine (dH,F&#8764;2.0&#8197;&#197;, &#8736;&#8764;138&#176;), and a through&#8208;space interaction is observed by NMR spectroscopy with couplings (1hJNH,F) of 19&#177;1&#8197;Hz. A combination of experimental (NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography) and theoretical methods (DFT calculations) were used for the characterization of this weak interaction. In particular, the effects of conformational rigidity and steric compression on coupling were investigated. This scaffold was used for the direct comparison of fluoride with methoxy as HB acceptors, and the susceptibility of the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F interaction to changes in electron distribution and resonance was probed by preparing a series of molecules with different electron&#8208;donating or &#8208;withdrawing groups in the positions para to the NH and F. The results support the idea that fluorine can act as a weak HB acceptor, and the HB strength can be modulated through additive and linear electronic substituent effects.

         <title>From Thioureas to Thioquinolines through Isolated Benzothiazines by Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective synthesis of benzothiazine heterocycles starting from thioureas has been achieved. With gold catalysis, these organic compounds evolved in basic medium towards the formation of amino thioquinolines through an unprecedented aromatisation process of the heterocycle. The reaction was also carried out stoichiometrically by reaction with gold complexes to afford thioquinolines coordinated to the gold fragment.







Abstract
New benzothiazine heterocycles have been formed from thiourea derivatives by using different gold catalysts. The catalyst and the conditions were optimised towards the selective synthesis of six&#8208;membered benzothiazine heterocycles, characterised by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Interestingly, these organic compounds evolved under gold catalysis in basic medium to achieve the formation of amino thioquinolines through an unprecedented aromatisation process of the heterocycle. The reaction was also carried out stoichiometrically by reaction with gold complexes to afford thioquinolines coordinated to the gold fragment. Benzothiazine, amino thioquinoline heterocycles and gold&#8208;derived species have a great potential for biological applications.

         <title>&#8220;Four&#8208;in&#8208;One&#8221; Nanozyme and Natural Enzyme Symbiotic System of Cu2&#8208;xSe&#8722;GOx for Cervical Cancer Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
The nanozyme@natural enzyme symbiotic system of Cu2&#8208;xSe&#8722;GOx exhibited prominent &#8220;four&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; cascaded catalytic enzyme activities including catalase, peroxidase, glutathione oxidase and glucose oxidase. The ingenious Cu2&#8208;xSe&#8722;GOx could significantly induce the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at tumor regions; this results in a tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;activated &#8220;four&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; enzyme cascade that is lethal to cervical cancer. All in all, Cu2&#8208;xSe&#8722;GOx can act as a high&#8208;performance and safe bioactive material for cancer treatment.







Abstract
Cervical cancer, as a common malignant tumor of the reproductive system, seriously threatens women&#8216;s life and health, and is difficult to be cured by traditional treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Fortunately, tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;activated catalytic therapy with high efficiency and reduced off&#8208;target toxicity has emerged as a novel treatment model. Herein, we designed a &#8220;four&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; nanozyme and natural enzyme symbiotic system of Cu2&#8208;xSe&#8722;GOx for TME&#8208;triggered cascaded catalytic enhanced cancer treatment. In response to unique TME, Cu2&#8208;xSe with catalase activity could effectively catalyze over&#8208;expressed H2O2 in cancer cells into O2. Subsequently, the glucose oxidase (GOx) could deplete intracellular glucose with the assistance of O2; this not only achieves starvation therapy, but also regenerates H2O2 to boost the generation of highly cytotoxic .OH due to the peroxidase activity of Cu2&#8208;xSe. Moreover, although the free&#8208;radical scavenger glutathione (GSH) is overexpressed in tumor cells, Cu2&#8208;xSe with glutathione oxidase activity could effectively consume GSH for enhanced ROS production. Thus, the &#8220;four&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; nanozyme@natural enzyme symbiotic system of Cu2&#8208;xSe&#8722;GOx could induce significant ROS accumulation at the tumor regions, thus providing a potential approach for the treatment of cervical cancer.

         <title>From &#946;&#8208;Na2B6O10 to Na3AlB8O15 and Na3Al2B7O15: Structural Tuning of Anionic&#8208;Group Architectures by Substitution of [BO4] by [AlO4] Covalent Tetrahedra</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new sodium aluminum borates, Na3AlB8O15 and Na3Al2B7O15, have been successfully synthesized by substitution of [AlO4] for [BO4] covalent tetrahedra from &#946;&#8208;Na2B6O10. Anionic&#8208;group architectures are transformed from a two&#8208;dimensional double layer to a three&#8208;dimensional framework.







Abstract
Two new sodium aluminum borates, Na3AlB8O15 and Na3Al2B7O15, have been successfully synthesized by the high&#8208;temperature solution method. They crystallize in the different space groups, P21/c and P2/c, respectively. The B&#8722;O configurations of &#946;&#8208;Na2B6O10, Na3AlB8O15 and Na3Al2B7O15 are compared to feature complicated different dimensional open&#8208;framework structures caused by the substitution of [BO4] by [AlO4] covalent tetrahedra. Moreover, the experimental results indicate that Na3AlB8O15 and Na3Al2B7O15 have short ultraviolet (UV) cutoff edges (&lt;187&#8197;nm). The first&#8208;principles calculations show that Na3AlB8O15 and Na3Al2B7O15 have moderate birefringence (0.075 and 0.041@1064&#8197;nm, respectively).

         <title>Monitoring the Thiol/Thiophenol Molecule&#8208;Modulated Plasmon&#8208;Mediated Silver Oxidation with Dark&#8208;Field Optical Microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiol/thiophenol molecules can modulate the plasmon&#8208;mediated silver oxidation. Compared with molecules having electron donating groups, molecules having electron accepting groups accelerate the silver oxidation dramatically. The modulation of silver oxidation is attributed to the modulation of the charge separation between the Ag NPs and the adsorbed thiol or thiophenol molecules.







Abstract
Surface plasmon can trigger or accelerate many photochemical reactions, especially useful in energy and environmental industries. Recently, molecular adsorption has proven effective in modulating plasmon&#8208;mediated photochemistry, however the realized chemical reactions are limited and the underlying mechanism is still unclear. Herein, by using in&#8197;situ dark&#8208;field optical microscopy, the plasmon&#8208;mediated oxidative etching of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs), a typical hot&#8208;hole&#8208;driven reaction, is monitored continuously and quantitatively. The presence of thiol or thiophenol molecules is found essential in the silver oxidation. In addition, the rate of silver oxidation is modulated by the choice of different thiol or thiophenol molecules. Compared with the molecules having electron donating groups, the ones having electron accepting groups accelerate the silver oxidation dramatically. The thiol/thiophenol modulation is attributed to the modulation of the charge separation between the Ag NPs and the adsorbed thiol or thiophenol molecules. This work demonstrates the great potential of molecular adsorption in modulating the plasmon&#8208;mediated photochemistry, which will pave a new way for developing highly efficient plasmonic photocatalysts.

         <title>Weinreb Amide, Ketone and Amine as Potential and Competitive Secondary Molecular Stations for Dibenzo&#8208;[24]Crown&#8208;8 in [2]Rotaxane Molecular Shuttles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemical way to bistable molecular shuttles that hold a combination of amine, Weinreb amide and/or ketone as secondary stations for dibenzo&#8208;[24]crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8) is reported. Ketone and amine moieties have similar affinity for DB24C8 that is better than the Weinreb amide has. Hydrogen bonds between DB24C8 and an unhindered axle usually favor a co&#8208;conformation; unless steric restrictions, hence the constrained co&#8208;conformation, impose a predominance of alternative and unexpected even weaker H&#8208;bonds. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Gauthier and F. Coutrot (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103805).

         <dc:description>The long&#8208;standing history of platinum coordination complexes in nucleic acid recognition attests to the unique suitability of such species for therapeutic applications. Here, we report the synthetic exploration and development of a family of di&#8208;imine ligands, and their platinum(II) complexes, elaborated on a 3&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3&#8208;  a  ]pyridine platform which, in its unsubstituted form, has recently been shown to display exceptional capabilities for guanine quadruplex (G4) targeting. The identification of facile, high&#8208;yielding synthetic methods for the derivatization of this platform for the incorporation of additional sites of interactions with guanine quadruplex loops and grooves, along with the optimization of platinum(II) complexation methods, are discussed. Gratifyingly, preliminary biophysical screening of this novel family of binders validates all but one family members as robust G4 binders, and highlights enhanced selectivity for quadruplex  vs  duplex DNA compared to the parent compound. These results bear promise for practical developments based on this platform.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the Scope of Polyoxometalates as Artificial Proteases towards Hydrolysis of Insoluble Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the enormous importance of&#160;insoluble proteins in biological processes, their structural investigation remains a challenging task. The development of artificial enzyme&#8208;like catalysts would greatly facilitate the elucidation of their structure since currently used enzymes in proteomics largely lose activity in the presence of surfactants, which are necessary to solubilize insoluble proteins. In this study, the hydrolysis of a fully insoluble protein by&#160;polyoxometalate complexes as artificial proteases&#160;in surfactant solutions is reported for the first time. The hydrolysis of zein as a model protein was investigated in the presence of&#160;Zr(IV) and Hf(IV)&#160;substituted Keggin&#8208;type&#160;polyoxometalates (POMs), (Et2NH2)10[M(&#945;&#8208;PW11O39)2]&#160;(M = Zr or Hf), and different concentrations of the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The selective hydrolysis of the protein upon incubation with the catalyst was observed, and the results indicate that the hydrolytic selectivity and activity of the POM catalysts strongly depends on the concentration of surfactant. The molecular interactions between the POM catalyst and zein in the presence of SDS were explored using a combination of spectroscopic techniques which indicated competitive binding between POM and SDS towards the protein. Furthermore, the formation of micellar superstructures in tertiary POM/surfactant/protein solutions has been confirmed by electrical conductivity and Dynamic Light Scattering.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Photocathode Supported by Copper Nanosheets Array for Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Z&#8208;scheme overall solar water splitting is a mimic of natural photosynthesis to convert solar energy into chemical energy. Since the energy levels of most organic semiconductors match well with the hydrogen evolution potential, they have great application prospects as photocathodes in Z&#8208;scheme photoelectrochemical systems. However, due to the weak light absorption and difficult carriers separation, the photocurrent density and onset potential of organic photocathodes are still low. To solve these problems, we introduced copper nanosheets array (Cu NSA) framework under the organic layers to increase the surface reaction sites, improve the light absorption and enhance the distribution range of built&#8208;in electric field simultaneously. As a result, the photocurrent density and onset potential of poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene):[6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid (P3HT:PCBM) photocathode were enhanced significantly. The onset potential increased by 50 mV to 0.65 V vs. RHE, and the photocurrent density reached &#8208;1 mA cm&#8208;2 at 0 V vs. RHE, which was 18 times that of the sample without Cu NSA. The optimized photocathode was connected with titanium dioxide nanorods array photoanode in a tandem manner to realize the spontaneous overall water splitting. Without bias and cocatalyst, the photocurrent density was maintained at 110 &#956;A cm&#8208;2 and the solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion efficiency was 0.14% in neutral solution. These results provide a feasible method for optimizing the performance of organic photocathode.</dc:description>

         <title>A Stereoselective Glycosylation Approach to the Construction of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;Glycosidic Linkages and Convergent Synthesis of Saponins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional syntheses of the 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;L&#8208;glycosidic linkages rely mainly on the neighboring group participation in the glycosylation reactions. The requirement of a neighboring participation group (NPG) excludes direct glycosylation with (1&#8594;2)&#8208;linked glycan donors, thus only allowing stepwise assembly of glycans and glycoconjugates containing this type of common motif. Here we disclose a robust glycosylation protocol for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;L&#8208;glycosidic linkages without resorting to NPG, which employs an optimal combination of glycosyl N&#8208;phenyltrifluroacetimidates as donors, FeCl3 as promoter, and CH2Cl2/nitrile as solvent. A broad substrate scope has been demonstrated by glycosylations with twelve (1&#8594;2)&#8208;linked di&#8208; and trisaccharide donors and thirteen alcoholic acceptors including eight complex triterpene derivatives. Most of the glycosylation reactions are high yielding and exclusively 1,2&#8208;trans selective. Ten representative naturally occurring triterpene saponins are thus synthesized in a convergent manner after deprotection of the coupled glycosides. Intensive mechanistic studies indicate that the present glycosylation proceeds via a SN2&#8208;type substitution of the glycosyl &#945;&#8208;nitrilium intermediates. Importantly, FeCl3 dissociates and coordinates with nitrile into [Fe(RCN)nCl2]+ and [FeCl4]&#8208;, and the ferric cationic species coordinates with the alcoholic acceptor to provide a protic species which activates the imidate, meanwhile the poor nucleophilicity of [FeCl4]&#8208; ensures a non&#8208;interruptive role for the glycosidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Spiroconjugated Tetraaminospirenes as Donors in Color&#8208;tunable Charge&#8208;transfer Emitters with Donor&#8208;acceptor Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Charge&#8208;transfer emitters are attractive due to their color tunability and potentially high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs). We herein present tetraaminospirenes as donor moieties, which, in combination with a variety of acceptors, furnished 12 chargetransfer emitters with a range of emission colors and PLQYs of up to 99%. The spatial separation of their frontier molecular orbitals was obtained through careful structural design, and two DA structures were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. A range of photophysical measurements supported by DFT calculations shed light on the optoelectronic properties of this new family of spiro&#8208;NN&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>Europium is different: Solvent and ligand effects on oxidation state outcomes and C&#8208;F activation in reactions between europium metal and pentafluorophenylsilver</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unique outcomes have emerged from the redox transmetallation/ protolysis (RTP) reactions of europium metal with [Ag(C  6  F  5  )(py)] (py = pyridine) and pyrazoles (RR&#8242;pzH). In pyridine, a solvent not normally used for RTP reactions, the products were mainly Eu  II  complexes, [Eu(RR&#8242;pz)  2  (py)  4  ] (RR&#8242;pz = 3,5&#8208;diphenylpyrazolate (Ph  2  pz)  1  ; 3&#8208;(2&#8208;thienyl)&#8208;5&#8208;trifluoromethylpyrazolate (ttfpz)  2  ; 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenylpyrazolate (PhMepz)  3  ). However, use of 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyrazole (  t  Bu  2  pzH) gave trivalent [Eu(  t  Bu  2  pz)  3  (py)  2  ]  4  , whereas the bulkier N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;difluorophenyl)formamidine (DFFormH) gave divalent [Eu(DFForm)  2  (py)  3  ]  5  . In tetrahydrofuran (thf), the usual solvent for RTP reactions, C&#8208;F activation was observed for the first time with [Ag(C  6  F  5  )(py)] in such reactions. Thus trivalent [{Eu  2  (Ph  2  pz)  4  (py)  4  (thf)  2  (&#956;&#8208;F)  2  }{Eu  2  (Ph  2  pz)  4  (py)  2  (thf)  4  (&#956;&#8208;F)  2  }] (  6  ), [Eu  2  (ttfpz)  4  (py)  2  (dme)  2  (&#956;&#8208;F)  2  ] (  7  ), [Eu  2  (  t  Bu  2  pz)  4  (dme)  2  (&#956;&#8208;F)  2  ] (  8  ) were obtained from the appropriate pyrazoles, the last two after crystallization from 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (dme). Surprisingly 3,5&#8208;dimethylpyrazole (Me  2  pzH) gave the divalent cage [Eu  6  (Me  2  pz)  10  (thf)  6  (&#956;&#8208;F)  2  ] (  9  ).</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Activation of Unsaturated Amides with Schwartz's Reagent: A Diastereoselective Access to Cyclopentanols and N,O&#8208;Dimethylcyclopentylhydroxylamines.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concomitant generation of a nucleophilic and an electrophilic site from unsaturated Weinreb amide by using Cp2Zr(H)Cl) as the unique reagent was developed to promote a cyclisation reaction. The access to trans&#8208;2&#8208;substituted cyclopentanols or cyclopentylhydroxylamines can be selectively driven by a judicious choice of the cyclisation promotor. An access to cis&#8208;3&#8208;substituted is also described.







Abstract
The diastereoselective access to cyclopentanols and N,O&#8208;dimethylcyclopentylhydroxylamines from 4&#8208;pentenoic acid&#8208;derived Weinreb amides is described. Based on the concomitant generation of both the nucleophilic and the electrophilic poles by hydrozirconation of the amide and the C=C double bond, the cyclisation may be tuned towards cyclopentanols or N,O&#8208;dimethylcyclopentylhydroxylamines depending on the ring&#8208;closure promotor. An extension to cis 3&#8208;substituted N,O&#8208;dimethylcyclohexylhydroxylamines is also presented.

         <title>TADF&#8208;Sensitized Fluorescent Enantiomers: A New Strategy for High&#8208;Efficiency Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;sensitized CPL (TSCP) is proposed to realize efficient circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) by taking TADF molecule as sensitizer to improve exciton utilization and CP&#8208;FL molecule as emitter to realize CPEL. In this article, we highlight the research status of CPEL and CP&#8208;TADF, mainly focus on the concept of TSCP and its applications in CP&#8208;OLEDs, and finally give the prospects of TSCP in CPEL research area.







Abstract
A promising strategy of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitized circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has been proposed for improving the electroluminescence efficiencies of circularly polarized fluorescent emitters. Compared with chiral TADF emitters which suffer from the dilemma of small &#916;EST accompanied by small kr, the TADF&#8208;sensitized CPL (TSCP) strategy using TADF molecules as sensitizers and CP&#8208;FL molecules as emitters might be the most promising method to construct high&#8208;performance circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). Consequently, by taking advantage of the theoretically 100&#8201;% exciton utilization of TADF sensitizers, especially, by designing CP&#8208;FL emitters with high PLQY, narrow FWHM and large glum values, TSCP&#8208;type CP&#8208;OLEDs with excellent overall performances can be realized.

         <title>Perfluoroaryl and Perfluoroheteroaryl Reagents as Emerging New Tools for Peptide Synthesis, Modification and Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perfluoroaromatic and perfluoroheteroaromatic reagents have emerged in recent years as powerful reagents for peptide and protein modification. Dominated by their regio&#8208; and chemoselective nucleophilic aromatic substitution chemistry under mild conditions, they have been used in peptide synthesis, tagging, cyclisation, stapling and protein bioconjugation.







Abstract
Peptides and proteins are becoming increasingly valuable as medicines, diagnostic agents and as tools for biomedical sciences. Much of this has been underpinned by the emergence of new methods for the manipulation and augmentation of native biomolecules. Perfluoroaromatic reagents are perhaps one of the most diverse and exciting tools with which to modify peptides and proteins, due principally to their nucleophilic substitution chemistry, high electron deficiency and the ability for their reactivity to be tuned towards specific nucleophiles. As discussed in this minireview, in recent years, perfluoroaromatic reagents have found applications as protecting groups or activating groups in peptide synthesis and as orthogonal handles for peptide modification. Furthermore, they have applications in chemoselective &#8216;tagging&#8217;, stapling and bioconjugation of peptides and proteins, as well as tuning of &#8216;drug&#8208;like&#8217; properties. This review will also explore possible future applications of these reagents in biological chemistry.

         <title>A Series of Polyoxometalate&#8208;Viologen Photochromic Materials for UV Probing, Amine Detecting and Inkless and Erasable Printing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three polyoxometalate&#8208;viologen Compounds&#8197;were designed and constructed by using two viologen ligands. Compounds&#8197;1&#8211;3 show excellent photochromic features with fast photoresponse under irradiation of ultraviolet light with different degrees of color changes. These Compounds&#8197;exhibit amine detecting and inkless and erasable printing properties, and they can be prepared into a mixed matrix film as a good UV detector.







Abstract
In this work, by using two kinds of viologen ligands three POM&#8208;based Compounds&#8197;were obtained under hydrothermal conditions, namely [AgI(bmypd)0.5(&#946;&#8208;Mo8O26)0.5] (1) (bmypd&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2Cl=1,1&#8242;&#8208;[Biphenyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(methylene)]bis(4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyinium)dichloride), [AgI2(bypy)4(HSiW12O40)2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;14H2O (2) and [AgI(bypy)(&#947;&#8208;Mo8O26)0.5] (3) (bypy&#8901;Cl=1&#8208;Benzyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyinium chloride). The structures were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT&#8211;IR), Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Compounds&#8197;1&#8211;3 show excellent photochromic ability with fast photoresponse under the irradiation of ultraviolet light with different degrees of color changes. So compounds&#8197;1&#8211;3 can be used as visible ultraviolet detectors. Compounds&#8197;1&#8211;3 also possess photoluminescence properties with fast and excellent fluorescence quenching effect. Compounds&#8197;1&#8211;3 also can be used as inkless and erasable printing materials with suspensions of 1&#8211;3 applied to filter paper. Compounds&#8197;1&#8211;3 can also produce color changes in amine vapor environment, especially in an NH3 atmosphere. Compounds&#8197;1&#8211;3 can be used as organic amine detectors.

         <title>Preparation of Polyfunctionalized Aromatic Nitriles from Aryl Oxazolines</title>

         <dc:description>
Aryl nitriles from oxazolines: We report a new method for for preparing highly functionalized tri&#8208;, tetra&#8208; and penta&#8208;substituted aromatic nitriles by using two successive magnesiations with sBu2Mg in toluene followed by trapping reactions with a broad range of electrophiles followed by an efficient conversion of the oxazolyl&#8208;directing group to a nitrile function by using oxalyl chloride and catalytic amounts of DMF (50&#8201;&#176;C, 4&#8197;h).







Abstract
A selective ortho,ortho&#8217;&#8208;functionalization of readily available aryl oxazolines by two successive magnesiations with sBu2Mg in toluene followed by trapping reactions with electrophiles, such as (hetero)aryl iodides or bromides, iodine, tosyl cyanide, ethyl cyanoformate or allylic bromides (39 examples, 62&#8211;99&#8201;% yield) is reported. Treatment of these aryl oxazolines with excess oxalyl chloride and catalytic amounts of DMF (50&#8201;&#176;C, 4&#8197;h) provided the corresponding nitriles (36 examples, 73&#8211;99&#8201;% yield). Conversions of these nitriles to valuable heterocycles are reported, and a tentative mechanism is proposed.

         <title>Elucidating the Supramolecular Copolymerization of N&#8208; and C&#8208;Centered Benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;Tricarboxamides: The Role of Parallel and Antiparallel Packing of Amide Groups in the Copolymer Microstructure</title>

         <dc:description>
Copolymerizing N&#8208; and C&#8208;centered BTAs in nonpolar solutions affords helical, H&#8208;bond&#8208;stabilized supramolecular copolymers with a blocky microstructure. In contrast, in bulk, lamellar structures form and long&#8208;range order is lost. This is a result of the antiparallel H&#8208;bonds between N&#8208; and C&#8208;centered BTAs, which are less stable than the parallel H&#8208;bonds formed in the homopolymers.







Abstract
An in&#8208;depth study of the supramolecular copolymerization behavior of N&#8208; and C&#8208;centered benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamides (N&#8208; and C&#8208;BTAs) has been conducted in methylcyclohexane and in the solid state. The connectivity of the amide groups in the BTAs differs, and mixing N&#8208; and C&#8208;BTAs results in supramolecular copolymers with a blocky microstructure in solution. The blocky microstructure results from the formation of weaker and less organized, antiparallel hydrogen bonds between N&#8208; and C&#8208;BTAs. In methylcyclohexane, the helical threefold hydrogen&#8208;bonding network present in C&#8208; and N&#8208;BTAs is retained in the mixtures. In the solid state, in contrast, the hydrogen bonds of pure BTAs as well as their mixtures organize in a sheet&#8208;like pattern, and in the mixtures long&#8208;range order is lost. Drop&#8208;casting to kinetically trap the solution microstructures shows that C&#8208;BTAs retain the helical hydrogen bonds, but N&#8208;BTAs immediately adopt the sheet&#8208;like pattern, a direct consequence of the lower stabilization energy of the helical hydrogen bonds. In the copolymers, the stability of the helical aggregates depends on the copolymer composition, and helical aggregates are only preserved when a high amount of C&#8208;BTAs is present. The method outlined here is generally applicable to elucidate the copolymerization behavior of supramolecular monomers both in solution as well as in the solid state.

         <title>Steric Repulsion Induced Conformational Switch in Supramolecular Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular strain engineering of dodecasubstituted picket&#8208;fence porphyrins led us to develop a method for selective atropisomeric conversion based on the steric clashes. The tension rigidified architecture revealed distinct spectroscopic alterations with vibrant colorimetric changes making it a first case study where the porphyrin&#8208;based photometric response is induced only by atropisomer configurations.







Abstract
Inspired by the rigidified architecture of &#8216;picket&#8208;fence&#8217; systems, we propose a strategy utilizing strain to impose intramolecular tension in already peripherally overcrowded structures leading to selective atropisomeric conversion. Employing this approach, tuneable shape&#8208;persistent porphyrin conformations were acquired exhibiting distinctive supramolecular nanostructures based on the orientation of the peripheral groups. The intrinsic assemblies driven by non&#8208;covalent bonding interactions form supramolecular polymers while encapsulating small molecules in parallel channels or solvent&#8208;accessible voids. The developed molecular strain engineering methodologies combined with synthetic approaches have allowed the introduction of the pivalate units creating a highly strained molecular skeleton. Changes in the absorption spectrum indicated the presence of severe steric repulsions between the peripheral groups which were confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. To release the steric strain introduced by the peripheral units, thermal equilibration strategies were used to selectively convert the most abundant atropisomer to the desirable minor one.

         <title>Acenaphtho[1,2&#8208;d][1,2,3]triazole and Its Kuratowski Complex: A &#960;&#8208;Extended Tecton for Supramolecular and Coordinative Self&#8208;Assembly</title>

         <dc:description>
Two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional structures can be assembled from &#960;&#8208;extended triazoles, which act as versatile tectons capable of metal coordination, hydrogen bonding, and &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions. Infinite stacks of cyclic hydrogen&#8208;bonded tetrads or triads are obtained in the crystal, with substitution controlling the size of the assembly. In spite of their bulkiness, &#960;&#8208;extended triazoles easily form pentanuclear zinc(II) Kuratowski complexes, characterized by concave outer surfaces and moderate solid&#8208;state porosity.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Extended acenaphtho[1,2&#8208;d][1,2,3]triazoles, the unsubstituted Anta&#8208;H and its di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl derivative Dibanta&#8208;H, as well as 5,6,7,8&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;naphtho[2,3&#8208;d][1,2,3]triazole Cybta&#8208;H were obtained in concise syntheses. In the solid state, Dibanta&#8208;H forms an unprecedented hydrogen&#8208;bonded cyclic tetrad, stabilized by dispersion interactions of the bulky tBu substituents, whereas a cyclic triad was found in the crystal structure of Anta&#8208;H. These cyclic assemblies form infinite slipped stacks in the crystals. Evidence for analogous hydrogen&#8208;bonded self&#8208;assembly in solution was provided by low&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy and computational analyses. Kuratowski&#8208;type pentanuclear complexes [Zn5Cl4(Dibanta)6] and [Zn5Cl4(Cybta)6] were prepared from the respective triazoles. In the Dibanta complexes, the &#960;&#8208;aromatic surfaces of the ligands extend from the edges of the tetrahedral Zn5 core, yielding an enlarged structure with significant internal molecular free volume and red&#8208;shifted fluorescence.

         <title>Developing Efficient Small Molecule Acceptors with sp2&#8208;Hybridized Nitrogen at Different Positions by Density Functional Theory Calculations, Molecular Dynamics Simulations and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multidimensional modelling is performed to envision the structural changes at atomic and molecular level. sp2&#8208;hybridized nitrogen is substituted at the inner or the outmost position of central core, side chain, and terminal group of ITIC for improving the device performance. It is found that nitrogen substitution at end&#8208;capping group is a better strategy to design efficient small molecule acceptors.







Abstract
Chemical structure of small molecule acceptors determines their performance in organic solar cells. Multiscale simulations are necessary to avoid trial&#8208;and&#8208;error based design, ultimately to save time and resources. In current study, the effect of sp2&#8208;hybridized nitrogen substitution at the inner or the outmost position of central core, side chain, and terminal group of small molecule acceptors is investigated using multiscale computational modelling. Quantum chemical analysis is used to study the electronic behavior. Nitrogen substitution at end&#8208;capping has significantly decreased the electron&#8208;reorganization energy. No big change is observed in transfer integral and excited state behavior. However, nitrogen substitution at terminal group position is good way to improve electron&#8208;mobility. Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of newly designed acceptors is predicted using machine learning. Molecular dynamics simulations are also performed to explore the dynamics of acceptor and their blends with PBDB&#8208;T polymer donor. Florgy&#8208;Huggins parameter is calculated to study the mixing of designed small molecule acceptors with PBDB&#8208;T. Radial distribution function has indicated that PBDB&#8208;T has a closer packing with N3 and N4. From all analysis, it is found that nitrogen substitution at end&#8208;capping group is a better strategy to design efficient small molecule acceptors.

Large&#8208;but&#8208;flexible palladium precatalysts have been rationally designed to enable the challenging Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination of coordinating heterocycles. This robust new class of precatalysts permits cross&#8208;coupling of a variety of heterocycles with aryl, alkyl and heteroarylamines, including historically challenging oxazoles and thiazoles as well as electron&#8208;deficient heterocycles containing multiple heteroatoms, under practical aerobic conditions. Studies on the ligand structure and electronic properties of the carbene center are also reported.







Abstract
A new class of large&#8208;but&#8208;flexible Pd&#8208;BIAN&#8208;NHC catalysts (BIAN=acenaphthoimidazolylidene, NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) has been rationally designed to enable the challenging Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination of coordinating heterocycles. This robust class of BIAN&#8208;NHC catalysts permits cross&#8208;coupling under practical aerobic conditions of a variety of heterocycles with aryl, alkyl, and heteroarylamines, including historically challenging oxazoles and thiazoles as well as electron&#8208;deficient heterocycles containing multiple heteroatoms with BIAN&#8208;INon (N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;di(4&#8208;heptyl)phenyl)&#8208;7H&#8208;acenaphtho[1,2&#8208;d]imidazol&#8208;8&#8208;ylidene) as the most effective ligand. Studies on the ligand structure and electronic properties of the carbene center are reported. The study should facilitate the discovery of even more active catalyst systems based on the unique BIAN&#8208;NHC scaffold.

         <title>PTFE/EP Reinforced MOF/SiO2 Composite as a Superior Mechanically Robust Superhydrophobic Agent towards Corrosion Protection, Self&#8208;Cleaning and Anti&#8208;Icing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

The robust, highly durable and multi&#8208;functional superhydrophobic surfaces were fabricated by spray coating technique on various substrates, including metals and non&#8208;metals such as steel 304, steel 306&#8197;L, fiber, cardboard, and glass.







Abstract
Organic resin cross&#8208;linking ZIF&#8208;67/SiO2 superhydrophobic (SHPB) multilayer coating was successfully fabricated on metal substrate. The perfluoro&#8208;octyl&#8208;triethoxy silane (POTS) modified ZIF&#8208;67 and SiO2 coating was applied on primary coated polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and epoxy resin (EP) via spray coating method. Here, we present that the robust superhydrophobicity can be realized by structuring surfaces at two different length scales, with a nanostructure design to provide water repellence and a microstructure design to provide durability. The as&#8208;fabricated multilayer coating displayed superior water&#8208;repellence (CA=167.4&#176;), chemical robustness (pH=1&#8211;14) and mechanical durability undergoing 120th linear abrasion or 35th rotatory abrasion cycle. By applying different acidic and basic corrosive media and various weathering conditions, it can still maintain superior&#8208;hydrophobicity. To get a better insight of interaction between inhibitor molecules and metal surface, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed, showing lower energy gap and increased binding energy of ZPS/SiO2/PTFE/EP (ZPS=ZIF&#8208;67+POTS) multilayer coating compared to the ZIF&#8208;67/SiO2/PTFE/EP, thereby supporting the experimental findings. Additionally, such coatings may be useful for applications such as anti&#8208;corrosion, self&#8208;cleaning, and anti&#8208;icing multi&#8208;functionalities.

Four novel Ir(III) photo&#8208;catalysts (Ir1&#8211;Ir4) were synthesized and applied for photocatalytic cancer therapy. Upon blue and green light irradiation, these photocatalysts generated singlet oxygen and induced rapid photo&#8208;catalytic oxidation of the cellular coenzymes NAD(P)H. Ir2 triggered promising photo&#8208;induced anticancer activity via induction of intracellular redox imbalance and exhibited ideal in&#8197;vivo photo&#8208;induced catalytic anticancer activity.







Abstract
Four photo&#8208;catalysts of the general formula [Ir(CO6/ppy)2(L)]Cl where CO6=coumarin 6 (Ir1&#8211;Ir3), ppy=2&#8208;phenylpyridine (Ir4), L=4&#8242;&#8208;(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine (Ir1), 4&#8242;&#8208;(3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine (Ir2 and Ir4), and 4&#8208;([2,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridin]&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;yl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylaniline (Ir3) were synthesized and characterized. These photostable photo&#8208;catalysts (Ir1&#8211;Ir3) showed strong visible light absorption between 400&#8211;550&#8197;nm. Upon light irradiation (465 and 525&#8197;nm), Ir1&#8211;Ir3 generated singlet oxygen and induced rapidly photo&#8208;catalytic oxidation of cellular coenzymes NAD(P)H. Ir1&#8211;Ir3 showed time&#8208;dependent cellular uptake with excellent intracellular retention efficiency. Upon green light irradiation (525&#8197;nm), Ir2 provided a much higher photo&#8208;index (PI=793) than the clinically used photosensitizer, 5&#8208;aminolevulinicacid (5&#8208;ALA, PI&gt;30) against HeLa cancer cells. The observed necro&#8208;apoptotic anticancer activity of Ir2 was due to the Ir2 triggered photo&#8208;induced intracellular redox imbalance (by NAD(P)H oxidation and ROS generation) and change in the mitochondrial membrane potential. Remarkably, Ir2 showed in&#8197;vivo photo&#8208;induced catalytic anticancer activity in mouse models.

         <title>Crown Ether Host&#8208;Guest Molecular Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crown&#8208;ether&#8208;based molecular ferroelectrics are attractive for the host&#8208;guest structure, where the guest cation is anchored in the host crown ether and the anion acts as the counterion. Their crystal structure, phase transition and ferroelectric properties are discussed in this minireview. Additionally, an outlook on the chemical design of high&#8208;performance crown ether host&#8208;guest molecular ferroelectrics is given.







Abstract
In recent years, molecular ferroelectrics have received great attention due to their low weight, mechanical flexibility, easy preparation and excellent ferroelectric properties. Among them, crown&#8208;ether&#8208;based molecular ferroelectrics, which are typically composed of the host crown ethers, the guest cations anchored in the crown ethers, and the counterions, are of great interest because of the host&#8208;guest structure. Such a structure allows the components to occur order&#8208;disorder transition easily, which is beneficial for inducing ferroelectric phase transition. Herein, we summarized the research progress of crown ether host&#8208;guest molecular ferroelectrics, focusing on their crystal structure, phase transition, ferroelectric&#8208;related properties. In view of the small spontaneous polarization and uniaxial nature, we outlook the chemical design strategies for obtaining high&#8208;performance crown&#8208;ether&#8208;based molecular ferroelectrics. This minireview will be of guiding significance for the future exploration of crown ether host&#8208;guest molecular ferroelectrics.

         <title>The Appeal of Small Molecules for Practical Nonlinear Optics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donor&#8208;acceptor substitution in small molecules with a compact &#960;&#8208;conjugated system leads to record&#8208;high molecular nonlinearities in small sizes. A dense monolithic assembly of such molecules can have extraordinarily strong nonlinear optical properties. The ability to vapor deposit such small molecule materials makes them highly competitive for adding all&#8208;optical switching and/or electro&#8208;optic functionality to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art integrated photonics.







Abstract
Small organic molecules with a &#960;&#8208;conjugated system that consists of only a few double or triple bonds can have significantly smaller optical excitation energies when equipped with donor and acceptor groups, which raises the quantum limits to the molecular polarizabilities. As a consequence, third&#8208;order nonlinear optical polarizabilities become orders of magnitude larger than those of molecules of similar size without donor&#8208;acceptor substitution. This enables strong third&#8208;order nonlinear optical effects (as high as 1000 times those of silica glass) in dense, amorphous monolithic assemblies. These properties, accompanied by the possibility of deposition from the vapor phase and of electric&#8208;field poling at higher temperatures, make the resulting materials competitive towards adding an active nonlinear optical or electro&#8208;optic functionality to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art integrated photonics platforms.

         <title>DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG Adducts of 1,3&#8208;Butadiene: Synthesis, Structural Characterization, and Formation in 1,2,3,4&#8208;Diepoxybutane Treated DNA**

Formamidopyrimidnes (FAPy) are highly mutagenic DNA lesions. Here we describe the first synthesis and complete structural characterization of a diepoxybutane (DEB) derived formamidopyrimidine of dG (DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG). An isotope dilution nanoLC&#8208;ESI+&#8208;HRMS/MS method was developed and DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG adducts were detected in DEB treated DNA.







Abstract
Metabolic activation of the human carcinogen 1,3&#8208;butadiene (BD) by cytochrome 450 monooxygenases gives rise to a genotoxic diepoxide, 1,2,3,4&#8208;diepoxybutane (DEB). This reactive electrophile alkylates guanine bases in DNA to produce N7&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3,4&#8208;epoxy&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;dG (N7&#8208;DE&#8208;dG) adducts. Because of the positive charge at the N7 position of the purine heterocycle, N7&#8208;DEB&#8208;dG adducts are inherently unstable and can undergo spontaneous depurination or base&#8208;catalyzed imidazole ring opening to give N6&#8208;[2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;erythro&#8208;pentofuranosyl]&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamino&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4&#8208;oxo&#8208;5&#8208;N&#8208;1&#8208;(oxiran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)propan&#8208;1&#8208;ol&#8208;formamidopyrimidine (DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG) adducts. Here we report the first synthesis and structural characterization of DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG adducts. Authentic standards of DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG and its 15N3&#8208;labeled analogue were used for the development of a quantitative nanoLC&#8208;ESI+&#8208;HRMS/MS method, allowing for adduct detection in DEB&#8208;treated calf thymus DNA. DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG formation in DNA was dependent on DEB concentration and pH, with higher numbers observed under alkaline conditions.

Annulating C60 fullerenes in NHC ligands enhances the catalysis of Ru&#8208;based olefin metathesis catalysis.







Abstract
Predictive catalysis must be the tool that does not replace experiments, but acts as a selective agent, so that synthetic strategies of maximum profitability are used in the laboratory in a surgical way. Here, nanotechnology has been used in olefin metathesis from homogeneous Ru&#8208;NHC catalysts, specifically annulating a C60 fullerene to the NHC ligand. Based on results with the C60 in the backbone, a sterile change with respect to the catalysis of the metal center, an attempt has been made to bring C60 closer to the metal, by attaching it to one of the two C&#8722;N bonds of the imidazole group of the SIMes (1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) ligand (reference NHC ligand of the 2nd generation Grubbs catalysts) to increase the steric pressure of C60 in the first sphere of reactivity of the metal. The DFT calculated thermodynamics and the kinetics of SIMes&#8208;derived systems show that they are efficient catalysts for olefin metathesis.

         <title>The Shuttling Cascade in Lasso Peptide Benenodin&#8208;1 is Controlled by Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Step&#8208;by&#8208;Step: The naturally occurring peptide [1]rotaxane benenodin&#8208;1 undergoes a shuttling cascade under thermal activation and can be switched between four different states in water. The mechanism of wheel translation is reminiscent of synthetically derived molecular shuttles. Switchable peptide rotaxanes pave the way for a new generation of functional mechanically interlocked architectures solely made from biomolecules.







Abstract
The lasso peptide benenodin&#8208;1, a naturally occurring and bacterially produced [1]rotaxane, undergoes a reversible zip tie&#8208;like motion under heat activation, in which a peptidic wheel stepwise translates along a molecular thread in a cascade of &#8220;tail/loop pulling&#8221; equilibria. Conformational and structural analyses of four translational isomers, in solution and in the gas phase, reveal that the equilibrium distribution is controlled by mechanical and non&#8208;covalent forces within the lasso peptide. Furthermore, each dynamic pulling step is accompanied by a major restructuring of the intramolecular hydrogen bonding network between wheel and thread, which affects the peptide's physico&#8208;chemical properties.

         <title>Narrowly&#8208;Distributed Conjugated Polymers Synthesized through Suzuki Polymerization with Palladium(II) N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complex Confined in Dendritic Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complex of Pd was embedded in dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticle support for achieving confined Suzuki polymerization of a variety of monomer combinations to produce rich structural patterned conjugated polymers with narrow molecular weight distribution and high solubility and processibility in common organic solvents.







Abstract
A catalytic heterogenous Suzuki polymerization method was developed by confining the Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed cross coupling reactions to take place exclusively in the nanochannels of dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles. Conjugated polymers with various monomer combinations, including donor&#8208;acceptor structures, were obtained in high yields. The molecular weights of the obtained polymers were well controlled with narrow molecular weight distributions (PDI value down to 1.13). All the polymeric products were highly soluble in common organic solvents, granting them with high processability. All the features of this confined Suzuki polymerization method endow the conjugated polymers great potential in optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Low&#8208;Valent Titanium Species Stabilized with Aluminum/Boron Hydride Fragments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure and bonding of bimetallic half&#8208;sandwich titanium(III) and titanium(II) complexes stabilized by boron (BH4&#8722;, BH3Me&#8722;, B2H62&#8722;) or aluminum {(&#956;&#8208;H)2AlXL)} (X=Cl, Br; L=thf, OEt2) hydride ligands are reported. DFT calculations on the hydride&#8208;bridged Ti(II)&#8722;Al compounds reveal a strong electron density donation from the Ti&#8722;Ti bond to the empty s orbitals of the Al atoms. These unprecedented M&#8722;M&#8594;Z type interactions could be common for bi&#8208; or multimetallic low&#8208;valent early transition metal derivatives.







Abstract
Low&#8208;valent titanium species were prepared by reaction of [TiCp*X3] (Cp*=&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5; X=Cl, Br, Me) with LiEH4 (E=Al, B) or BH3(thf), and their structures elucidated by experimental and theoretical methods. The treatment of trihalides [TiCp*X3] with LiAlH4 in ethereal solvents (L) leads to the hydride&#8208;bridged heterometallic complexes [{TiCp*(&#956;&#8208;H)}2{(&#956;&#8208;H)2AlX(L)}2] (L=thf, X=Cl, Br; L=OEt2, X=Cl). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for those compounds reveal an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state with a Ti&#8722;Ti bond and can be described as titanium(II) species. The theoretical analyses also show strong interactions between the Ti&#8722;Ti bond and the empty s orbitals of the Al atom of the AlH2XL fragments, which behave as &#963;&#8208;accepting (Z&#8208;type) ligands. Analogous reactions of [TiCp*X3] with LiBH4 (2 and 3&#8197;equiv.) in tetrahydrofuran at room temperature and at 85&#8201;&#176;C lead to the titanium(III) compounds [{TiCp*(BH4)(&#956;&#8208;X)}2] (X=Cl, Br) and [{TiCp*(BH4)(&#956;&#8208;BH4)}2], respectively. The treatment of [TiCp*Me3] with 4 and 5&#8197;equiv. of BH3(thf) produces the diamagnetic [{TiCp*(BH3Me)}2(&#956;&#8208;B2H6)] and paramagnetic [{TiCp*(&#956;&#8208;B2H6)}2] complexes, respectively.

         <title>Bioinspired Artificial Photosynthetic Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mimicking photosynthesis using artificial systems, as a means for solar energy conversion and green fuel generation, is one of the holy grails of modern science. This perspective presents the recent advances of our laboratory towards developing artificial photosynthetic systems. In one approach, native photosystems are interfaced with electrodes to yield photobioelectrochemical cells that transform light energy into electrical power. This is exemplified by interfacing photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII) as an electrically contacted assembly mimicking the native Z&#8208;scheme, and by the assembly of an electrically wired PSI/glucose oxidase biocatalytic conjugate on an electrode support. Illumination of the functionalized electrodes led to light&#8208;induced generation of electrical power, or to the generation of photocurrents using glucose as the fuel. The second approach introduces supramolecular photosensitizer nucleic acid / electron acceptor complexes as functional modules for effective photoinduced electron transfer stimulating the subsequent biocatalyzed generation of NADPH or the Pt&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;catalyzed evolution of molecular hydrogen. Application of the DNA machineries for scaling&#8208;up the photosystems is demonstrated. A third approach presents the integration of artificial photosynthetic modules into dynamic nucleic acid networks undergoing reversible reconfiguration or dissipative transient operation in the presence of auxiliary triggers. Control over photoinduced electron transfer reactions and photosynthetic transformations by means of the dynamic networks is demonstrated.</dc:description>

Control over photoinduced electron transfer reactions and photosynthetic transformations by means of the dynamic networks is demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Acid&#8208;Catalyzed RNA Oligomerization from 3&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;cGMP</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heat, protons and a dry crystalline material are the three prerequisites for oligonucleotide synthesis from acid&#8208;form 3&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;cyclic guanosine monophosphate monomers. The process is believed to play a role in the abiotic generation of the most ancient RNA molecules on our planet. Now, we show that the reaction is acid&#8208;catalyzed and that the facile crystallization of the monomers is enabled by their distinctly low solubility. The highly ordered supramolecular architecture present in the monomer crystals provides ideal steric conditions for the formation of intermolecular phosphodiester linkages between the cyclic nucleotide units. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Braun, J.&#8197;E. &#352;poner et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103672).

         <title>Solution Phase Reactivity of Dibenzo[c,e][1,2]azaborinine: Activation and Insertion into Si&#8208;E Single Bonds (E=H, OSi(CH3)3, F, Cl) by a BN&#8208;Aryne</title>

Si&#8208;F Bond Activation: The BN triple bond of a BN&#8208;aryne is extremely reactive and can even activate the inert Si&#8722;F bond for insertion in solution. The mechanism involves coordinative interaction between the boron and fluorine atoms followed by nucleophilic attack of the nitrogen atom on silicon.







Abstract
The boron&#8208;nitrogen analogue of ortho&#8208;benzyne, 1,2&#8208;azaborinine, is a reactive intermediate that features a formal boron&#8208;nitrogen triple bond. We here show by combining experimental and computational techniques that the Lewis acidity of the boron center of dibenzo[c,e][1,2]azaborinine allows interaction with the silicon containing single bonds Si&#8722;E through the silicon bonding partner E (E=F, Cl, OR, H). The binding to boron activates the Si&#8722;E bonds for subsequent insertion reaction. This shows that the BN&#8208;aryne is a ferocious species that even can activate and insert into the very strong Si&#8722;F bond.

         <title>Exploring the Influence of Intermolecular Interactions in Prebiotic Chemistry Using Laser Spectroscopy and Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploiting the synergy between laser spectroscopy and calculations, the interaction potential energy surfaces of the dimers between adenine and 4&#8208;aminopyrimidine with theobromine have been explored. Both systems form stable aggregates with two strong hydrogen bonds, with binding energy values resembling the Watson&#8208;Crick analogue interactions. An energetic comparison suggests how intermolecular interactions influenced the evolutionary sequence.







Abstract
One of the most fascinating questions in chemistry is why nature chose CGAT as the alphabet of life. Very likely, such selection was the result of multiple factors and a long period of refinement. Here, we explore how the intermolecular interactions influenced such process, by characterizing the formation of dimers between adenine, theobromine and 4&#8208;aminopyrimidine. Using a combination of mass&#8208;resolved excitation spectroscopy and DFT calculations, we determined the structure of adenine&#8208;theobromine and 4&#8208;aminopyrimidine&#8208;theobromine dimers. The binding energy of these dimers is very close to the canonical adenine&#8208;thymine nucleobases. Likewise, the dimers are able to adopt Watson&#8208;Crick conformations. These findings seem to indicate that there were many options available to build the first versions of the informational polymers, which also had to compete with other molecules, such as 4&#8208;aminopyrimidine, which does not have a valid attaching point for a saccharide. For some reason, nature did not select the most strongly&#8208;bonded partners or if it did, such proto&#8208;bases were later replaced by the nowadays canonical CGAT.

         <title>Insights into Proton Dynamics in a Photofunctional Salt&#8208;Cocrystal Continuum: Single&#8208;Crystal X&#8208;ray, Neutron Diffraction, and Hirshfeld Atom Refinement</title>

Creating crystal chameleons: X&#8208;ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, and Hirshfeld atom refinement (HAR) demonstrate that the slight difference of the N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bonds (HBs) in crystalline metastable acid&#8208;base complexes gives distinct photoluminescent properties. Our results contribute to understanding the complicated relationship between photofunction and proton dynamics in acid&#8208;base complexes, helping to create novel photofunctional materials.







Abstract
X&#8208;ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, and theoretical calculations were used to investigate the relationship between the optical properties and degree of protonation in acid&#8208;base complexes. We prepared five acid&#8208;base complexes by using a pyridine&#8208;modified pyrrolopyrrole derivative and salicylic acid. Two of the prepared acid&#8208;base complexes were polymorphs of guest&#8208;free crystals with green emission; the other three were guest&#8208;inclusion crystals with yellow emission containing CH2Cl2, CH2Br2, or C2H4Cl2. The presence or absence of guests caused the emission to change color, altering the hydrogen bond strength between the acid&#8208;base complexes. Accurate N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H distances between the pyridyl moiety and the carboxy group over the temperature range 123 to 273&#8197;K were 1.40&#8197;&#197; for the guest&#8208;free crystals and 1.25&#8197;&#197; for the guest&#8208;inclusion crystals. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the complex relationship between photofunction and proton dynamics in acid&#8208;base complexes.

         <title>How 5&#8201;f Electron Polarisability Drives Covalency and Selectivity in Actinide N&#8208;Donor Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

A series of isostructural actinide (Th, U&#8722;Pu) complexes with N,N&#8217;&#8208;ethylene&#8208;bis((pyrrole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methanimine) (H2L, H2pyren) reveal different An&#8722;Nimine vs. An&#8722;Npyrrolide bond lengths and covalent character of the An&#8722;N bonds. Comparison to the [An(salen)2] complexes displays a slightly weaker overall bond strength of pyren to AnIV (An=Th, U, Np, Pu), except for PaIV.







Abstract
We report a series of isostructural tetravalent actinide (Th, U&#8722;Pu) complexes with the N&#8208;donor ligand N,N&#8217;&#8208;ethylene&#8208;bis((pyrrole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methanimine) (H2L, H2pyren). Structural data from SC&#8208;XRD analysis reveal [An(pyren)2] complexes with different An&#8722;Nimine versus An&#8722;Npyrrolide bond lengths. Quantum chemical calculations elucidated the bonding situation, including differences in the covalent character of the coordinative bonds. A comparison to the intensely studied analogous N,N&#8242;&#8208;ethylene&#8208;bis(salicylideneimine) (H2salen)&#8208;based complexes [An(salen)2] displays, on average, almost equal electron sharing of pyren or salen with the AnIV, pointing to a potential ligand&#8208;cage&#8208;driven complex stabilisation. This is shown in the fixed ligand arrangement of pyren and salen in the respective AnIV complexes. The overall bond strength of the pure N&#8208;donor ligand pyren to AnIV (An=Th, U, Np, Pu) is slightly weaker than to salen, with the exception of the PaIV complex, which exhibits extraordinarily high electron sharing of pyren with PaIV. Such an altered ligand preference within the early AnIV series points to a specificity of the 5f1 configuration, which can be explained by polarisation effects of the 5&#8201;f electrons, allowing the strongest f electron backbonding from PaIV (5f1) to the N donors of pyren.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A series of isostructural actinide (Th, U&#8722;Pu) complexes&lt;/b&gt; with &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&#8217;&lt;/i&gt;-ethylene-bis((pyrrole-2-yl)methanimine) (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Comparison to the [An(salen)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] complexes displays a slightly weaker overall bond strength of pyren to An&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; (An=Th, U, Np, Pu), except for Pa&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a series of isostructural tetravalent actinide (Th, U&#8722;Pu) complexes with the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-donor ligand &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&#8217;&lt;/i&gt;-ethylene-bis((pyrrole-2-yl)methanimine) (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;pyren). Structural data from SC-XRD analysis reveal [An(pyren)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] complexes with different An&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;imine&lt;/sub&gt; versus An&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;pyrrolide&lt;/sub&gt; bond lengths. Quantum chemical calculations elucidated the bonding situation, including differences in the covalent character of the coordinative bonds. A comparison to the intensely studied analogous &lt;i&gt;N,N&#8242;-&lt;/i&gt;ethylene-bis(salicylideneimine) (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;salen)-based complexes [An(salen)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] displays, on average, almost equal electron sharing of pyren or salen with the An&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;, pointing to a potential ligand-cage-driven complex stabilisation. This is shown in the fixed ligand arrangement of pyren and salen in the respective An&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; complexes. The overall bond strength of the pure &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-donor ligand pyren to An&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; (An=Th, U, Np, Pu) is slightly weaker than to salen, with the exception of the Pa&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; complex, which exhibits extraordinarily high electron sharing of pyren with Pa&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;. Such an altered ligand preference within the early An&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; series points to a specificity of the 5&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; configuration, which can be explained by polarisation effects of the 5&#8201;&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt; electrons, allowing the strongest &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt; electron backbonding from Pa&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; (5&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) to the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; donors of pyren.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
In recent years, owing to the demand for high&#8208;efficiency phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting devices (PhOLEDs), many studies have been conducted on the development of bipolar host materials. A series of imidazolyl&#8208;phenylcarbazole&#8208;based host materials, i.&#8201;e., im&#8208;CzP, im&#8208;CzPCz, im&#8208;CzPtBu, and im&#8208;OCzP, were synthesized to obtain high&#8208;efficiency green and red&#8208;emitting PhOLEDs. With im&#8208;OCzP as the host, satisfactory peak efficiencies of 22.2 (77.0&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1 and 93.1&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1) and 14.1&#8201;% (9.0&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1 and 10.1&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1) could be obtained, respectively. To further improve the performance of the devices, an electron transport material, bis&#8208;4,6&#8208;(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;3&#8208;pyridylphenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;methylpyrimidine (B3PyMPM) was selected to construct a co&#8208;hosted system. The efficiency of im&#8208;OCzP combined with B3PyMPM forming co&#8208;hosts could also achieve high values of 23.0 (80.0&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1 and 98.8&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1) and 16.5&#8201;% (10.2&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1 and 13.4&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1) for green and red PhOLEDs, respectively. These results exhibited that the proposed bipolar hosts have great flexibility in adjusting the carrier balance of EML in OLEDs, demonstrating their ingenious design and high potential.

         <title>Bimodal fluorescence/magnetic resonance molecular probes with extended spin lifetimes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bimodal molecular probes combining nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and fluorescence have been widely studied in basic science as well as clinical research. The investigation of spinphenomena holds promise to broaden the scope of available probes allowing for deeper insights into physiological processes. Here, we are introducing a class of molecules with a bimodal character with respect to fluorescence and nuclear spin singlet states. Singlet states are NMR silent but can be probed indirectly. We report on symmetric, perdeuterated molecules in which the singlet states can be populated via vanishingly small electron&#8208;mediated couplings (below 1 Hz). The lifetimes of these states are an order of magnitude longer than the longitudinal relaxation times and up to 4 minutes at 7 T. Moreover, these molecules show either aggregation induced emission (AIE) or aggregation caused quenching (ACQ) with respect to their fluorescence. In the latter case, we observed the existence of excited dimers which we propose to use in a switchable manner in combination with the quenching of nuclear spin singlet states.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically precise gold nanoclusters (Au NCs) are an emerging class of quantum&#8208;sized nanomaterials. The intrinsic discrete electronic energy levels endowed them with fascinating electronical and optical properties. They have been widely applied in the field of optoelectronics, photovoltaics, catalysis, bio&#8208;sensing, bio&#8208;imaging and therapeutics. Nevertheless, most Au NCs are synthesized in organic solvents and are insoluble in aqueous solution, which restricted their biological applications. In this review, we focused on the recent progress in the preparation of water&#8208;soluble Au NCs and their biological applications. We first reviewed their synthetic methods, including direct synthesis from hydrophilic templates and indirect phase transfer of hydrophobic Au NCs. We then discussed their photophysical properties such as emission enhancement and their influence factors. We next summarized their latest applications in the fields of biosensing, biolabeling, and bioimaging. Finally, we outlined the challenges and potentials for the future development of these Au NCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Transformations Using Strictosidine Aglycones: Divergent Total Syntheses of Monoterpenoid Indole Alkaloids in the Early Stage of Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of bioinspired transformations that are applied to convert strictosidine aglycones into monoterpenoid indole alkaloids is reported. The highly reactive key intermediates, strictosidine aglycones, were prepared in situ by simple removal of a silyl protecting group from the silyl ether derivatives, and converted selectively via bioinspired transformations under substrate control into heteroyohimbine&#8208; and corynantheine&#8208;type, and akagerine and naucleaoral related alkaloids. Thus, concise, divergent total syntheses of 13 monoterpenoid indole alkaloids, (&#8211;)&#8208;cathenamine, (&#8211;)&#8208;tetrahydroalstonine, (+)&#8208;dihydrocorynantheine, (&#8211;)&#8208;corynantheidine, (&#8211;)&#8208;akagerine, (&#8211;)&#8208;dihydrocycloakagerine, (&#8211;)&#8208;naucleaoral B, (+)&#8208;naucleidinal, (&#8211;)&#8208;naucleofficines D and III, (&#8211;)&#8208;nauclefiline, and (&#8211;)&#8208;naucleamides A and E, were accomplished in fewer than 13 steps.</dc:description>

Thus, concise, divergent total syntheses of 13 monoterpenoid indole alkaloids, (&#8211;)-cathenamine, (&#8211;)-tetrahydroalstonine, (+)-dihydrocorynantheine, (&#8211;)-corynantheidine, (&#8211;)-akagerine, (&#8211;)-dihydrocycloakagerine, (&#8211;)-naucleaoral B, (+)-naucleidinal, (&#8211;)-naucleofficines D and III, (&#8211;)-nauclefiline, and (&#8211;)-naucleamides A and E, were accomplished in fewer than 13 steps.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Assessing the importance of cation size in the tetragonal&#8208;cubic phase transition in lithium garnet electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium garnets are promising solid&#8208;state electrolytes for next generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries. These materials have high ionic conductivity, a wide electrochemical window and stability with Li metal. However, lithium garnets have a maximum limit of 7 lithium atoms per formula unit (e.g. La3Zr2Li7O12), before the system transitions from a cubic to a tetragonal phase with poor ionic mobility. This arises from full occupation of the Li sites. Hence, the most conductive lithium garnets have Li between 6&#8208;6.55 Li per formula unit, which maintains the cubic symmetry and the disordered Li sub&#8208;lattice.

The tetragonal phase, however, forms the highly conducting cubic phase at higher temperatures, thought to arise from increased cell volume and entropic stabilisation permitting Li disorder. However, little work has been undertaken in understanding the controlling factors of this phase transition, which could enable enhanced dopant strategies to maintain room temperature cubic garnet at higher Li contents.

Here, a series of nine tetragonal garnets were synthesised and analysed via variable temperature XRD to understand the dependence of site substitution on the phase transition temperature. Interestingly the octahedral site cation radius was identified as the key parameter for the transition temperature with larger or smaller dopants altering the transition temperature noticeably. A site substitution was, however, found to make little difference irrespective of significant changes to cell volume.</dc:description>

         <title>An H2O2 Molecule Stabilized inside Open&#8208;Cage C60 Derivatives by a Hydroxy Stopper</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An H2O2 molecule was isolated inside hydroxylated open&#8208;cage fullerene derivatives by mixing of an H2O2 solution with a precursor molecule followed by reduction of one of carbonyl groups on its orifice. Depending on the reduction sites, two structural isomers for H2O2@open&#8208;fullerenes were obtained. The high encapsulation ratio of 81% was attained at low temperature. The structures of the peroxosolvate complexes thus obtained were studied by 1H NMR, X&#8208;ray analysis, and DFT calculations, showing a strong hydrogen bonding between the encapsulated H2O2 and the hydroxy group locating at the center of the orifice. This OH group was found to act as a kinetic stopper and the formation of the hydrogen bonding caused thermodynamic stabilization on the H2O2 molecule, both of which prevent its escape out of the cage. One of the peroxosolvates was isolated by HPLC, affording the H2O2@open&#8208;fullerene with 100% encapsulation ratio likely due to the intramolecular hydrogen bonding interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>New palladium&#8208;ZrO2 nano&#8208;architectures from thermal transformation of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 for carbonylative Suzuki and hydrogenation reactions.</title>

         <dc:description>The&#160; new nanocomposites, Pd/C/ZrO2, PdO/ZrO2, and Pd/PdO/ZrO2, were prepared by thermal conversion of Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;Zr&#8208;NH2 (MOF) in nitrogen or air atmosphere. The presence of Pd nanoparticles, uniformly distributed on the ZrO2 or C/ZrO2 matrix, was evidenced by TEM (TEM = Transmission Electron Microscopy), SEM (SEM = Scanning Electron Microscopy), Raman and XPS (XPS = X&#8208;ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy) methods. All pyrolysed composites retained the shape of the MOF template. They&#160; catalyze carbonylative Suzuki coupling under 1 atm CO with an efficiency significantly higher than the original&#160; Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;Zr&#8208;NH2. The most active PdO/ZrO2 composite, formed benzophenone with TOF up to 1600 h&#8208;1, while&#160; by using Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;Zr&#8208;NH2, much lower TOF values, 51 &#8208; 95 h&#8208;1, were achieved.&#160; After the reaction, PdO/ZrO2 was recovered with the same composition and catalytic activity. Very good results were also obtained in the transfer hydrogenation of benzophenones to alcohols with Pd/C/ZrO2 and PdO/ZrO2 catalysts under microwave irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolation of Cyclic Aluminium Polysulfides by Stepwise Sulfurization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the notable progress in aluminium chalcogenides, their sulfur congeners have rarely been isolated under mild conditions&#160; owing to &#160; limited synthetic precursors and methods. Herein, facile isolation of diverse&#160;molecular aluminium sulfides is achievable, by the reaction of&#160;  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;stabilized terphenyl dihydridoaluminium (  1  ) with various thiation reagents. Different to the known dihydridoaluminium&#160;  1  Tipp  ,&#160;  1  &#160;features balanced stability and reactivity at the Al center. It is this balance that enables the first monomeric aluminium hydride hydrogensulfide&#160;  2  , the six&#8208;membered cyclic aluminium polysulfide&#160;  4  &#160; and the five&#8208;membered cyclic aluminium polysulfide&#160;  6  &#160;t o be isolated, by reaction with various equivalents of elemental sulfur. Moreover, a rare aluminium heterocyclic sulfide with Al&#8208;S&#8208;P five&#8208;membered ring (  7  ) was obtained in a controlled manner. All new compounds were fully characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Their structures were confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Heteroallene Capture and Exchange at Functionalised&#160;Heptaphosphane Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite being known for decades the chemical reactivity of homoatomic seven&#8208;atom phosphorus clusters towards small molecules remains largely unexplored. Here, we report that neutral tris(silyl) functionalised heptaphosphane (P  7  (SiR  3  )  3  ) cages are capable of heteroallene capture between the P&#8722;Si bonds of the cluster. A range of isocyanates and an isothiocyanate were investigated. In the case of isocyanates, silyl bonding at oxygen or nitrogen is regioselectively directed by the functional group on the isocyanate and substituents on the silyl moiety. Above all, we find that captured isothiocyanate molecules can be exchanged for isocyanate molecules, indicative of small molecule catch and release. Small molecule catch and release at these Zintl&#8208;derived clusters reveals their potential application as chemical storage materials or as reusable probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Sterically Crowded Tris(2&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)phenyl)phosphine &#8208; Is it Still a Ligand?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tris(2&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)phenyl)phosphine, P(  o  &#8208;TMSC  6  H  4  )  3  , was synthesised and characterised in solution and in the solid state. The large steric bulk prevents most reactions of the phosphorus donor and makes the compound air stable both in the solid state as well as in solution. This shielded phosphine can still undergo three reactions, namely protonation, oxidation to the phosphine oxide under harsh conditions and complexation to Au  I  , thus forming a complex with linear coordination. Unexpectedly, complexation was unsuccessful with a range of other metal cations. Neither Pd  II  , Pt  II  , Zn  II  nor Hg  II  reacted and even the remaining coinage metal cations Cu  I  and Ag  I  could not be coordinated. Both the parent molecule as well as the reaction products were structurally characterised

by single crystal X&#8208;ray di raction, and the conformational change of geometry required to accommodate the additional atoms was analysed in detail. Apart from chemical oxidation with H  2  O  2  , P(  o  &#8208;TMSC  6  H  4  )  3  displays reversible electrochemical oxidation with a potential not unlike the one of sterically unencumbered

phosphines for which the oxidation is usually not reversible. P(  o  &#8208;TMSC  6  H  4  )  3  can thus be considered a model compound for the investigation of the electronic properties of sterically unencumbered phosphines.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tris(2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl)phosphine, P(  o  -TMSC  6  H  4  )  3  , was synthesised and characterised in solution and in the solid state. The large steric bulk prevents most reactions of the phosphorus donor and makes the compound air stable both in the solid state as well as in solution. This shielded phosphine can still undergo three reactions, namely protonation, oxidation to the phosphine oxide under harsh conditions and complexation to Au  I  , thus forming a complex with linear coordination. Unexpectedly, complexation was unsuccessful with a range of other metal cations. Neither Pd  II  , Pt  II  , Zn  II  nor Hg  II  reacted and even the remaining coinage metal cations Cu  I  and Ag  I  could not be coordinated. Both the parent molecule as well as the reaction products were structurally characterised

by single crystal X-ray di raction, and the conformational change of geometry required to accommodate the additional atoms was analysed in detail. Apart from chemical oxidation with H  2  O  2  , P(  o  -TMSC  6  H  4  )  3  displays reversible electrochemical oxidation with a potential not unlike the one of sterically unencumbered

phosphines for which the oxidation is usually not reversible. P(  o  -TMSC  6  H  4  )  3  can thus be considered a model compound for the investigation of the electronic properties of sterically unencumbered phosphines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Label&#8208;free Electrochemiluminescence Imaging of Single&#8208;Cell Adhesions Using Bipolar Nanoelectrode Array</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A label&#8208;free and fast approach for positive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging of single cells by bipolar nanoelectrode array is proposed. The reduction of oxygen at a platinized gold nanoelectrode array in a closed bipolar electrochemical system is coupled with an oxidative ECL process at the anodic side. For elevating the ECL imaging contrast of single cells, a driving&#160; voltage of &#8208;2.0 V is applied to in situ generate oxygen confined beneath cells that is subsequently used for ECL imaging at 1.1 V. High oxygen concentration in the confined space resulting from steric hindrance generates prominent oxygen reduction current at the cathodic side and higher ECL intensity at the anodic side, allowing positive ECL imaging of the cells adhesion region with excellent contrast. Cell morphology and adhesion strength can be successfully imaged with high image acquisition rate. This approach opens a new avenue for label&#8208;free imaging of single cells.</dc:description>

The reduction of oxygen at a platinized gold nanoelectrode array in a closed bipolar electrochemical system is coupled with an oxidative ECL process at the anodic side. For elevating the ECL imaging contrast of single cells, a driving&#160; voltage of -2.0 V is applied to in situ generate oxygen confined beneath cells that is subsequently used for ECL imaging at 1.1 V.

         <title>One&#8208;step Preparation of Fe/N/C Single&#8208;atom Catalysts Containing Fe&#8722;N4 Sites from an Iron Complex Precursor with 5,6,7,8&#8208;Tetraphenyl&#8208;1,12&#8208;diazatriphenylene Ligands</title>

         <dc:description>Fe/N/C single&#8208;atom catalysts containing Fe&#8722;N  x  sites prepared by pyrolysis are promising cathode materials for fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries due to their high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities. We have developed iron complexes containing N2&#8208; or N3&#8208;chelating coordination structures with preorganized aromatic rings in a 1,12&#8208;diazatriphenylene framework tethering bromo substituents as precursors to precisely construct Fe&#8722;N  4  sites in an Fe/N/C catalyst. One&#8208;step pyrolysis of the iron complex with carbon black forms atomically dispersed Fe&#8722;N  4  sites without iron aggregates. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and electrochemical measurements revealed that the iron complex with N3&#8208;coordination is more effectively converted to Fe&#8722;N  4  sites catalyzing ORR with a TOF value of 0.21 e&#8729;site  &#8722;1  &#8729;s  &#8722;1  at 0.8 V vs RHE. This indicates that the formation of Fe&#8722;N  4  sites is controlled by precise tuning of the chemical structure of the iron complex precursor.</dc:description>

         <title>Two faces of the same coin: coupling X&#8208;ray Absorption and NMR spectroscopies to investigate the exchange reaction between prototypical Cu coordination complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The satisfactory rationalization of complex reactive pathways in solution chemistry may greatly benefit from the combined use of advanced experimental and theoretical complementary methods of analysis. In this work, we combine X&#8208;Ray Absorption and  1  H&#8208;NMR spectroscopies with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Multivariate Curve Resolution and theoretical analyses to gain a comprehensive view on a prototypical reaction involving the variation of the oxidation state and local structure environment of a selected metal ion coordinated by organic ligands. Specifically, we investigate the 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpropanoic acid reduction of the octahedral complex established by the Cu  2+  ion with terpyridine to the tetrahedral complex formed by Cu  +  and neocuproine. Through our interdisciplinary approach we gain insights into the nature, concentration time evolution and structures of the key metal (XAS measurements) and organic (  1  H NMR measurements) species under reaction. We believe our method may prove to be useful in the toolbox necessary to understand the mechanisms of reactive processes of interest in solution.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Magnetoelectric (ME) materials exhibiting coupled electric and magnetic properties are of significant interest because of their potential use in memory storage devices, new sensors or low&#8208;consumption devices.

Furthermore, dielectric property of  1  was able to be tuned by an external magnetic field occurring from both spin&#8208;lattice coupling and molecular orientational variation.

         <dc:description>The nitridosilicate CaLu[Si  4  N  7&#8722;2  x  C  x  O  x  ] (  x  &#8776; 0.3) was synthesized by carbothermal reduction and nitridation starting from CaH  2  , Lu  2  O  3  , graphite and amorphous Si  3  N  4  at 1550&#176;C using a radiofrequency furnace.

         <title>Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells Employing Electron Injection/Transport Layers of Ionic Transition Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The optimized external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the proposed LEC reaches 6.8&#8201;%, which is among the highest values for perovskite LECs reported so far. This work successfully demonstrates that separating the ion transport, electron injection and transport layer from the perovskite emissive layer is more effective in adjusting device carrier balance than mixing all the components in a single emissive layer. As such, solution&#8208;processable perovskite/complex LECs open up a new way to realize efficient perovskite LECs.







Abstract
Recently, perovskites have attracted intense attention due to their high potential in optoelectronic applications. Employing perovskites as the emissive materials of light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) shows the advantages of simple fabrication process, low&#8208;voltage operation, and compatibility with inert electrodes, along with saturated electroluminescence (EL) emission. Unlike in previously reported perovskite LECs, in which salts are incorporated in the emissive layer, the ion&#8208;transport layer was separated from the emissive layer in this work. The layer of ionic transition metal complex (iTMC) not only provides mobile ions but also serves as an electron&#8208;injection/transport layer. Orthogonal solvents are used in spin coating to prevent the intermixing of stacked perovskite and iTMC layers. The blue iTMC with high ionization potential is effective in blocking holes from the emissive layer and thus ensures EL color saturation. In addition, the carrier balance of the perovskite/iTMC LECs can be optimized by adjusting the iTMC layer thickness. The optimized external quantum efficiency of the CsPbBr3/iTMC LEC reaches 6.8&#8201;%, which is among the highest reported values for perovskite LECs. This work successfully demonstrates that, compared with mixing all components in a single emissive layer, separating the layer of ion transport, electron injection and transport from the perovskite emissive layer is more effective in adjusting device carrier balance. As such, solution&#8208;processable perovskite/iTMC LECs open up a new way to realize efficient perovskite LECs.

         <title>Regioselective Magnesiation and Zincation Reactions of Aromatics and Heterocycles Triggered by Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switch at Will: The functionalization of aromatics and heterocycles by using Zn&#8208; or Mg&#8208;TMP (TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidyl) bases has been widely explored. In many cases, a full switch of regioselectivity can be achieved in the presence of a Lewis acid additive. Also, these methods are compatible with continuous flow setups allowing the use of highly reactive lithium bases under practical reaction conditions.







Abstract
Mixed TMP&#8208;bases (TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidyl), such as TMPMgCl&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;LiCl, TMP2Mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2LiCl, TMPZnCl&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;LiCl and TMP2Zn&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2LiCl, are outstanding reagents for the metalation of functionalized aromatics and heterocycles. In the presence of Lewis acids, such as BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 or MgCl2, the metalation scope of such bases was dramatically increased, and regioselectivity switches were achieved in the presence or absence of these Lewis acids. Furthermore, highly reactive lithium bases, such as TMPLi or Cy2NLi, are also compatible with various Lewis acids, such as MgCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2LiCl, ZnCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2LiCl or CuCN&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2LiCl. Performing such metalations in continuous flow using commercial setups permitted practical and convenient reaction conditions.

Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;triggered crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal and single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformations have received significant attention in the scientific community. To visualize such phenomenon, controlling the optical properties and the thermodynamic stability of the molecular crystals is a very important research subject. In this report, the selective growth of photoluminescent (PL) 1,8&#8208;bisphenylanthracene polymorphic (cI and cII) and 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane&#8208;inclusion crystals (iC) under various optimized conditions is described. These crystals exhibited unique mechano&#8208; and thermoresponsive disordering, crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal phase transition, and SCSC phase transition. In particular, rapid thermostimulus SCSC occurred from blue&#8208;PL cI into greenish&#8208;blue&#8208;PL cII. Interestingly, the SCSC phase transition of cI into cII was triggered by thermal stimuli and propagated spontaneously. Thermotriggered domino&#8208;like SCSC phase transition was observed on a fully visible timescale (ca. 125&#8197;&#956;m&#8201;min&#8722;1).

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Regiodivergence for Catalytic Stereoselective Semireduction of Allenamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed, ligand controlled regiodivergent semireduction of allenamides has been developed. This phosphine ligand&#8208;switched semireduction system has enabled an easy access to a broad scope of allylic and vinylic amides by using a single palladium catalyst. The excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities of the divergent processes were achieved by the employment of monodentate Xphos and bidentate BINAP ligands (see scheme).







Abstract
Ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergence has been developed for catalytic semireduction of allenamides with excellent chemo&#8208; and stereocontrol. This system also provides an example of catalytic regiodivergent semireduction of allenes for the first time. The divergence of the semireduction is enabled by ligand switch with the same palladium pre&#8208;catalyst under operationally simple and mild conditions. Monodentate ligand XPhos exclusively promotes selective 1,2&#8208;semireduction to afford allylic amides, while bidentate ligand BINAP completely switched the regioselectivity to 2,3&#8208;semireduction, producing (E)&#8208;enamide derivatives.

     alt="Ligand-Controlled Regiodivergence for Catalytic Stereoselective Semireduction of Allenamides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A palladium-catalyzed&lt;/b&gt;, ligand controlled regiodivergent semireduction of allenamides has been developed. This phosphine ligand-switched semireduction system has enabled an easy access to a broad scope of allylic and vinylic amides by using a single palladium catalyst. The excellent regio- and stereoselectivities of the divergent processes were achieved by the employment of monodentate Xphos and bidentate BINAP ligands (see scheme).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ligand-controlled regiodivergence has been developed for catalytic semireduction of allenamides with excellent chemo- and stereocontrol. This system also provides an example of catalytic regiodivergent semireduction of allenes for the first time. The divergence of the semireduction is enabled by ligand switch with the same palladium pre-catalyst under operationally simple and mild conditions. Monodentate ligand XPhos exclusively promotes selective 1,2-semireduction to afford allylic amides, while bidentate ligand BINAP completely switched the regioselectivity to 2,3-semireduction, producing (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-enamide derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Maytansinol Derivatives: Side Reactions as a Chance for New Tubulin Binders</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring the maytansinol acylation reaction, we have discovered previously unreported structural modifications of the maytansine scaffold. This permitted the synthesis and full characterization of a series of novel maytansinoids. A comprehensive biochemical evaluation and X&#8208;ray crystallography structure determinations of tubulin&#8208;maytansinoids identified potent tubulin binders. Moreover, our investigation allowed us to evaluate the impact of the structural modifications described.







Abstract
Maytansinol is a valuable precursor for the preparation of maytansine derivatives (known as maytansinoids). Inspired by the intriguing structure of the macrocycle and the success in targeted cancer therapy of the derivatives, we explored the maytansinol acylation reaction. As a result, we were able to obtain a series of derivatives with novel modifications of the maytansine scaffold. We characterized these molecules by docking studies, by a comprehensive biochemical evaluation, and by determination of their crystal structures in complex with tubulin. The results shed further light on the intriguing chemical behavior of maytansinoids and confirm the relevance of this peculiar scaffold in the scenario of tubulin binders.

         <title>Rational Design and Facile Synthesis of Dual&#8208;State Emission Fluorophores: Expanding Functionality for the Sensitive Detection of Nitroaromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel benzimidazole&#8208;based D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A fluorophores are rationally designed and concisely synthesized. Six compounds 4&#8201;a&#8211;4&#8201;f, as dual&#8208;state emission (DSE) materials, exhibit excellent photostability, solvatofluorochromic and extraordinary wide range of solvent compatibility. Among them, the DSE material 4&#8201;a is not only reasonably developed as a multifunctional fluorescent probe for sensitive detection of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) in aqueous system, but also processed into test strips and thin films for visual detection of NACs.







Abstract
Six novel benzimidazole&#8208;based D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A compounds 4&#8201;a&#8211;4&#8201;f were concisely synthesized by attaching different donor/acceptor units to the skeleton of 1,3&#8208;bis(1H&#8208;benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene on its 5&#8208;position through an ethynyl link. Due to the twisted conformation and effective conjugation structure, these dual&#8208;state emission (DSE) molecules show intense and multifarious photoluminescence, and their fluorescence quantum yields in solution and solid state can be up to 96.16 and 69.82&#8201;%, respectively. Especially, for excellent photostability, obvious solvatofluorochromic and extraordinary wide range of solvent compatibility, DSE molecule 4&#8201;a is a multifunctional fluorescent probe for the visual detection of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) with the limit of detection as low as 10&#8722;7 M. The quenching mechanism has been proved as the results of photoinduced electron transfer and fluorescence resonance energy transfer processes. Importantly, probe 4&#8201;a can sensitively detect NACs not only in real water samples, but also on 4&#8201;a&#8208;coated strips and 4&#8201;a@PBAT thin films.

         <title>An Alternative Route to Complex Allenes or Cyclooctatrienes via a Suzuki Cyclocarbopalladation Cascade</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation of elaborate polycycles using the Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reaction has been developed. If compounds 1&#8201;a&#8211;c are substituted by a triple bond an unusual cascade reaction affords allene derivatives 3 stereoselectively, while the presence of a substituted double bond, when reacted with a boronic ester or acid on 4, furnishes polysubstituted cyclooctatrienes 22 in high yields.







Abstract
The 4&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclocarbopalladation of vinyl bromides substituted with a triple or double bond resulted in impressive cascade reactions leading to different compounds under Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling conditions upon a slight modification of the starting material. When the starting compound carries a triple bond, a single cascade occurs providing a structure containing an allene, a tetrasubstituted cyclopropane, and a cyclobutene with complete stereoselectivity. When the related starting material possessing a double bond is reacted under the same conditions in the presence of various vinyl boronic esters or acids, an efficient 8&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization provides tricyclic systems comprised of a cyclobutene unit, as well as a cyclooctatriene. Five carbons of the latter can be selectively decorated with different substituents depending on the choice of the starting material and the boronic coupling partner.

         <title>Base&#8208;Mediated Radical Borylation of Alkyl Sulfones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utilization of inactivated alkyl sulfones as alkyl radical precursors in a base&#8208;mediated borylation reaction with B2neop2 is reported, allowing direct access to valuable alkyl boronate esters without further transesterification. This approach is scalable and is tolerant to a variety of functional groups and substrates including complex molecules.







Abstract
A practical and direct method was developed for the production of versatile alkyl boronate esters via transition metal&#8208;free borylation of primary and secondary alkyl sulfones. The key to the success of the strategy is the use of bis(neopentyl glycolato) diboron (B2neop2), with a stoichiometric amount of base as a promoter. The practicality and industrial potential of this protocol are highlighted by its wide functional group tolerance, the late&#8208;stage modification of complex compounds, no need for further transesterification, and operational simplicity. Radical clock, radical trap experiments, and EPR studies were conducted which show that the borylation process involves radical intermediates.

         <title>Ring Size Determines the Conformation, Global Aromaticity and Photophysical Properties of Macrocyclic Oligofurans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tradeoff between global and local aromaticity is demonstrated for a new series of macrocyclic furans. The global antiaromatic character decreases with macrocycle size, whereas the local aromatic character increases. This trend, which is observed both experimentally and computationally, is explained by the distortion of the larger macrocycles out of planarity.







Abstract
In &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocycles, there is a trade&#8208;off between the global and local expression of effects such as aromaticity, with the outcome of the trade&#8208;off determined by the geometry and aromaticity of the constituent units. Compared with other aromatic rings, the aromatic character of furan is relatively small, and therefore global effects in macrocyclic furans are expected to be more pronounced. Following our introduction of macrocyclic oligofuran, we present the first synthesis of a series of &#960;&#8208;conjugated bifuran macrocycles of various ring sizes, from trimer to hexamer, and characterize them using both computational and experimental methods. The properties of macrocyclic oligofurans change considerably with size: The smaller trimer is rigid, weakly emissive and planar as revealed by its single crystal structure, and displays global antiaromaticity. In contrast, the larger pentamer and hexamer are flexible, emissive, have non&#8208;planar structures, and exhibit local aromaticity. The results are supported by NICS and ACID calculations that indicate the global antiaromaticity of planar furan macrocycles, and by transient absorption measurements showing sharp absorption band for the trimer and only the internal conversion decay pathway.

     alt="Ring Size Determines the Conformation, Global Aromaticity and Photophysical Properties of Macrocyclic Oligofurans"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The tradeoff between global and local aromaticity&lt;/b&gt; is demonstrated for a new series of macrocyclic furans. The global antiaromatic character decreases with macrocycle size, whereas the local aromatic character increases. This trend, which is observed both experimentally and computationally, is explained by the distortion of the larger macrocycles out of planarity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &#960;-conjugated macrocycles, there is a trade-off between the global and local expression of effects such as aromaticity, with the outcome of the trade-off determined by the geometry and aromaticity of the constituent units. Compared with other aromatic rings, the aromatic character of furan is relatively small, and therefore global effects in macrocyclic furans are expected to be more pronounced. Following our introduction of macrocyclic oligofuran, we present the first synthesis of a series of &#960;-conjugated bifuran macrocycles of various ring sizes, from trimer to hexamer, and characterize them using both computational and experimental methods. The properties of macrocyclic oligofurans change considerably with size: The smaller trimer is rigid, weakly emissive and planar as revealed by its single crystal structure, and displays global antiaromaticity. In contrast, the larger pentamer and hexamer are flexible, emissive, have non-planar structures, and exhibit local aromaticity. The results are supported by NICS and ACID calculations that indicate the global antiaromaticity of planar furan macrocycles, and by transient absorption measurements showing sharp absorption band for the trimer and only the internal conversion decay pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis, Structures, and Properties of Helically Fused Anthraquinones with Unusually Close Carbonyl&#8208;Carbonyl Contacts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three anthraquinone units are angularly fused to construct a helical structure with sterically congested carbonyl groups, which influence structure, dynamic behavior, and spectroscopic and electrochemical properties relative to those of the anthracene analogs. The unusually close CO&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;CO contacts (2.47&#8197;&#197;) are discussed in terms of noncovalent interactions based on theoretical approaches.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;deficient aromatic ketones consisting of three fused anthraquinone units were synthesized by oxidation of the corresponding fused anthracenes. X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that these compounds had nonplanar helical structures with unusual contacts, C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O 2.467&#8197;&#197;, between the inner carbonyl groups. The role of n&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;* interactions in the short contacts was evaluated using a noncovalent interaction plot and natural bond orbital analysis. The dynamic process involving helical inversion was observed by the variable temperature 1H NMR measurement of a derivative with 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl groups, and the barrier was estimated to be 77&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. DFT calculations indicated that the helical inversion proceeded via a multistep mechanism. The characteristic spectroscopic and electrochemical data due to the electron&#8208;deficient anthraquinone units and the sterically congested carbonyl groups are discussed with the aid of DFT calculations.

         <title>Size&#8208;Induced Inversion of Selectivity in the Acylation of 1,2&#8208;Diols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis&#8208;base catalyzed acylation of aromatic 1,2&#8208;ethylenediols with anhydrides depends strongly on the size of the reagents and the &#960;&#8208;system of the diol. Steric effects have a larger impact on reactions of primary hydroxyl groups in the 1,2&#8208;diol as well as the monoester than those of secondary hydroxyl groups. For sterically demanding anhydrides this flips the selectivity towards secondary alcohols.







Abstract
Relative rates for the Lewis base&#8208;catalyzed acylation of aryl&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;diols with anhydrides differing in size have been determined by turnover&#8208;limited competition experiments and absolute kinetics measurements. Depending on the structure of the anhydride reagent, the secondary hydroxyl group of the 1,2&#8208;diol reacts faster than the primary one. This preference towards the secondary hydroxyl group is boosted in the second acylation step from the monoesters to the diester through size and additional steric effects. In absolute terms the first acylation step is found to be up to 35&#8197;times faster than the second one for the primary alcohols due to neighboring group effects.

         <title>Bulky PNP Ligands Blocking Metal&#8208;Ligand Cooperation Allow for Isolation of Ru(0), and Lead to Catalytically Active Ru Complexes in Acceptorless Alcohol Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized two 4Me&#8722;PNP Ru complexes and compared their catalytic performance against two traditional analogues used in acceptorless alcohol dehydrogenation catalysis, leading us to identify a common deactivation pathway. The 4Me&#8722;PNP complexes, which do not undergo dearomatization upon addition of base, also allowed us to obtain rare, albeit unstable, 16 electron mono&#8208;CO Ru(0), and their subsequent Ru(II) reaction products.







Abstract
We synthesized two 4Me&#8722;PNP ligands which block metal&#8208;ligand cooperation (MLC) with the Ru center and compared their Ru complex chemistry to their two traditional analogues used in acceptorless alcohol dehydrogenation catalysis. The corresponding 4Me&#8722;PNP complexes, which do not undergo dearomatization upon addition of base, allowed us to obtain rare, albeit unstable, 16 electron mono&#8208;CO Ru(0) complexes. Reactivity with CO and H2 allows for stabilization and extensive characterization of bis&#8208;CO Ru(0) 18 electron and Ru(II) cis and trans dihydride species that were also shown to be capable of C(sp2) &#8722;H activation. Reactivity and catalysis are contrasted to non&#8208;methylated Ru(II) species, showing that an MLC pathway is not necessary, with dramatic differences in outcomes during catalysis between iPr and tBu PNP complexes within each of the 4Me and non&#8208;methylated backbone PNP series being observed. Unusual intermediates are characterized in one of the new and one of the traditional complexes, and a common catalysis deactivation pathway was identified.

         <title>Joint Venture of Metal Cluster and Amphiphilic Cationic Minidendron Resulting in Near Infrared Emissive Lamellar Ionic Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guanidinium minidendrons bearing terminal aliphatic chains show a columnar liquid&#8208;crystalline behaviour once associated with chlorine anions, whereas they turned into layered phases when associated with phosphorescent octahedral molybdenum cluster dianions. The emission properties of the inorganic dyes are largely influenced by the minidendron chain length in these first&#8208;of&#8208;their&#8208;kind clustomesogens.







Abstract
Inorganic red&#8208;NIR emissive materials are particularly relevant in many fields like optoelectronic, bioimaging or solar cells. Benefiting from their emission in devices implies their integration in easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle materials like liquid crystals, whose long&#8208;range ordering and self&#8208;healing abilities could be exploited and influence emission. Herein, we present red&#8208;NIR emissive hybrid materials obtained with phosphorescent octahedral molybdenum cluster anions electrostatically associated with amphiphilic guanidinium minidendrons. Polarized optical microscopy and X&#8208;ray analysis show that while the minidendron chloride salts self&#8208;organize into columnar phases, their association with the dianionic metal cluster leads to layered phases. Steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved emission investigations demonstrate the influence of the minidendron alkyl chain length on the phosphorescence of the metal cluster core.

This reaction is based on a simple combination of copper(I) iodide and phenanthroline enabling the easy reduction of perfluoroalkyl iodides to the corresponding radical species that add to a wide range of heteroarenes including benzofurans, benzothiophenes, (aza)indoles, furans and pyrroles. High levels of regioselectivity were obtained in all cases and the efficiency and robustness of this process was highlighted by the direct perfluoroalkylation of furan&#8208;containing peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Photobase&#8208;Driven Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT) in a Strapped &#960;&#8208;Electron System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a new design strategy for an excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) fluorophore that can be used in acidic media. A photobasic pyridine&#8208;centered donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor&#8208;type fluorophore is combined with a basic trialkylamine &#8220;strap&#8221;. In the presence of an acid, protonation occurs predominantly at the amine moiety in the ground state. A single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of a pre&#8208;organized intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonded structure between the resulting ammonium moiety and the pyridine ring. Upon excitation, the intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer transition increases the basicity of the pyridine moiety in the excited state, resulting in proton transfer from the amine to the pyridine moiety. Consequently, the fluorophore takes on a polymethine&#8208;dye character in the ESIPT state, which gives rise to significantly red&#8208;shifted emission with an increased fluorescence quantum yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly stable univalent copper of Cu@Al/SBA&#8208;15 nanocomposite catalyzed the synthesis of novel aminobenzotriazoles derivatives and their fluorescence properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the development of green chemistry, it is still a challenge to maintain the unstable valence state of the metal in heterogeneous catalysts and realize new catalytic synthesis methods. In this paper, it was reported that an univalent copper nanocomposite (Cu@Al/SBA&#8208;15) could efficiently catalyze the formation of novel amino&#8208;containing benzotriazoles with great fluorescence properties in a new synthetic strategy. Subsequently, its application was further verified by acylation reaction to produce a series of novel benzotriazoles derivatives with high yield. It was worth noting that Cu@Al/SBA&#8208;15 nanocomposites not only enable the reaction completed with high yield in a short time, but also could be recycled many times without a significant reduction in activity, and the leaching of copper and aluminum species in reaction system was negligible. Finally, the detailed and feasible reaction mechanism was also provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Mild Microfluidic Approaches to Oxide Nanoparticles Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxide nanoparticles (oxide NPs) are advanced materials with a wide variety of applications in different fields. The use of continuous flow methods is particularly appealing for their synthesis due to the high control achieved over the reaction conditions and the easy process scalability. This review focuses on the preparation of oxide NPs using microfluidic setups at low temperature (&#8804; 80&#176;C), since the employment of mild reaction conditions is crucial for developing sustainable and cost&#8208;effective processes. A particular emphasis will be put on the improvement over the final product features (  e.g.  , size, shape, and size distribution) given by flow methods with respect to conventional batch procedures. The main issues that arise by treating NPs suspensions in microfluidic systems are product deposition or channel clogging; mitigation strategies to overcome these drawbacks will also be presented and discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium Complexes Bearing Axially Chiral Bipyridyls: The Mismatched Diastereomer Showed Red Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RutheniumII  &#160;complexes bearing three axially chiral bipyridyl ligands were synthesized as a new family of chiral complex dyes, and &#916;&#8208;(S)&#8208; and &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;diastereomers were obtained. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure analyses, spectroscopy, and DFT calculations suggested that all the bipyridyls maintained chirality in both the ground and excited states, and the &#916;&#8208;(S)&#8208; and &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;isomers are the matched (more relaxed) and mismatched (more constrained) pairs, respectively. The mismatched &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;isomer exhibited red circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) both in solution and in the solid state. The solution state CPP is the most intense of ruthenium complexes, while the solid state CPP is the first example of them.&#160;It is supposed that, for the &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;isomer, the six cumulative CH/&#960;&#160;interactions suppress further distortion in the T1&#160;state.</dc:description>

         <title>Carboboration&#8208;Driven Generation of a Silylium Ion for Vinylic C&#8211;F Bond Functionalization by B(C6F5)3 Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong main&#8208;group Lewis acids such as silylium ions are known to effectively promote heterolytic C(sp3)&#8211;F bond cleavage. However, carrying out the C(sp2)&#8211;F bond transformation of vinylic C&#8211; F bonds has remained an unmet challenge. Herein, we describe our development of a new and simple strategy for vinylic C&#8211;F bond transformation of &#945;&#8208;fluorostyrenes with silyl ketene acetals catalyzed by B(C6F5)3 under mild conditions. Our theoretical calculations revealed that a stabilized silylium ion, which is generated from silyl ketene acetals by carboboration, cleaves the C&#8211;F bond of &#945;fluorostyrenes. A comparative study of &#945;&#8208;chloro or bromostyrenes demonstrated that our reaction can be applied only to &#945;fluorostyrenes because the strong silicon&#8208;fluorine affinity facilitates an intramolecular interaction of silylium ions with fluorine atom to cleave the C&#8211;F bond. A broad range of &#945;&#8208;fluorostyrenes as well as a range of silyl ketene acetals underwent this C&#8211;F bond transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Terminal vs. Fluorine&#8208;Substituted N&#8208; Allenamides via Addition of Diazo Compounds to Terminal Ynamides.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A copper&#8208;mediated coupling reaction between ynamides and diazo&#8208;compounds to produce  N  &#8208;allenamides is reported for the first time. This method enables facile and rapid access to terminal  N  &#8208;allenamides by using commercially available TMS&#8208;diazomethane with wide functional group compatibility on the nitrogen. Furthermore, the ubiquity of molecules containing a fluorine moiety in medicine, in agricultural, and material science requires the continuous search of new building blocks, including this unique surrogate. The CuI/diazo protocol was successfully applied to the synthesis of fluorine&#8208;substituted  N  &#8208;allenamides. DFT calculations provided insights in the mechanism involved.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination cage&#8208;based emulsifiers: templated formation of metal oxide microcapsules monitored by in situ LC&#8208;TEM</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metallo&#8208;supramolecular self&#8208;assembly has yielded a plethora of discrete&#160;nanosystems, many of which show competence in capturing guests and catalyzing chemical reactions. However, the potential of low&#8208;molecular bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assemblies in the development of structured inorganic materials has rarely been methodically explored so far. Herein, we present a new type of metallo&#8208;supramolecular surfactant with the ability to stabilize non&#8208;aqueous emulsions for a significant period. The molecular design of the surfactant is based on a heteroleptic coordination cage (  CGA&#8208;3  ;  CGA  = Cage&#8208;based Gemini Amphiphile), assembled from two pairs of organic building blocks, grouped around two Pd(II) cations. Shape&#8208;complementarity between the differently functionalized components generates discrete amphiphiles with a tailor&#8208;made polarity profile, able to stabilize non&#8208;aqueous emulsions, such as hexadecane&#8208;in&#8208;DMSO. These emulsions were used as a medium for the synthesis of spherical metal oxide microcapsules (titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, and niobium oxide) from soluble, water&#8208;sensitive alkoxide precursors by allowing a controlled dosage of water to the liquid&#8208;liquid phase boundary. Synthesized materials were analyzed by a combination of electron microscopic techniques.  In situ  liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (LC&#8208;TEM) was utilized for the first time to visualize the dynamics of the emulsion&#8208;templated formation of hollow inorganic titanium oxide and zirconium oxide microspheres.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Acyclic Stereotriads Featuring Fluorinated Tetrasubstituted Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elaboration of enantioenriched complex acyclic stereotriads represents a challenge for modern synthesis even more when fluorinated tetrasubstituted stereocenters are targeted. We have been able to develop a simple strategy in a sequence of two unprecedented steps combining a diastereoselective aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction and an enantioselective organocatalyzed kinetic resolution. The aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction generates directly a large panel of acyclic 1,3&#8208;diols possessing a fluorinated tetrasubstituted stereocenter by condensation of fluorinated ketones with aldehydes under very mild basic conditions. The anti 1,3&#8208;diols featuring three contiguous stereogenic centers are generated with excellent diastereocontrol (typically &gt; 99:1 dr ). Depending upon the precursors both diastereomers of stereotriads are accessible through this flexible reaction. Furthermore, from the obtained racemic scaffolds, development of an organocatalyzed kinetic resolution enabled to generate the desired enantioenriched stereotriads with excellent selectivity (typically er &gt; 95:5).</dc:description>

         <title>Helic[6]arene&#8208;Based Chiral Pseudo[1]rotaxanes and [1]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral pseudo[1]rotaxanes and [1]rotaxanes constructed from macrocyclic arenes still remain a big challenge mainly owing to the lack of such chiral macrocycles. In this work, a new system of chiral pseudo[1]rotaxanes formed by self&#8208;inclusion of helic[6]arene containing amide linked with the terminal tertiary amines was first discovered. Based on an atom&#8208;economic stopping strategy, a pair of chiral [1]rotaxanes were conveniently obtained in almost quantitative yields by blocking the pseudo[1]rotaxanes with monobenzyl bromide of tetraphenylethene. The structures of pseudo[1]rotaxanes and [1]rotaxanes were characterized by 2D NMR spectra in solution, combining with the DFT calculations. The photophysical properties further revealed the efficient chirality transfer of helic[6]arene to the tetraphenylethene moiety, compared to their unthreaded chiral isomers. The discovery of the chiral pseudo[1]rotaxanes allows for a wide and available synthesis of chiral [1]rotaxanes, and also opening a new avenue to the design of chiral supramolecular materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the Preparation and Reactivity of Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 Methane Dehydroaromatization Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methane dehydroaromatization is a promising reaction for the direct conversion of methane to liquid hydrocarbons. The active sites and the mechanism of this reaction remain controversial. This work is focused on the operando X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy analysis of conventional Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 catalyst during its whole lifetime. Complemented by other characterization techniques, we derived spectroscopic descriptors of molybdenum precursor decomposition and its exchange with zeolite Br&#248;nsted acid sites. We found that the reduction of Mo&#8208;species proceeds in two steps and the active sites are of siminar nature, regardless of the Mo content. Furthermore, the ZSM&#8208;5 unit cell contracts at the beginning of the reaction, which coincided with benzene formation and it is likely related to the formation of hydrocarbon pool intermediates. Finally, although reductive regeneration of used catalysts via methanation is less effective as compared to combustion of coke, it does not affect the structure of the catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>PEGylated Poly&#8208;HDACi: a Designer Polyprodrug from Optimized Drug Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We designed, synthesized, and characterized a tri&#8208;block copolymer. Its hydrophobic part, a chain of histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) prodrug, was symmetrically flanked by two identical PEG blocks, whereas the built&#8208;in HDACi was a linear molecule, terminated with a thiol at one end, and a hydroxyl group at the other. Such a feature facilitated end to end linkage of prodrugs through alternatively aligned disulfides and carbonates. The disulfides served dual roles: redox sensors of smart nanomedicine, and warheads of masked HDACi drugs. This approach carefully designed to benefit both control&#8208;release and efficacy, is conceptually novel for optimizing drug units in nanomedicine. Micelles from this designer polyprodrug released only PEG, CO 2 and HDACi, and synergized with DOX against HCT116 cells, demonstrating its widespread potential in combination therapy. Our work for the first time highlighted the unique advantage of thiol&#8208;based drug molecules in nanomedicine design.</dc:description>

         <title>An ESIPT&#8208;dependent AIE fluorophore based on HBT derivative: substituent positional impact on aggregated luminescence and its application for hydrogen peroxide detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aiming to develop the facile organic fluorophore possessing excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), we designed and synthesized two isomers with different linkage site between hydroxyl of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl) benzothiazole (HBT) and a benzothiazole substituent (para position refers to  p&#8208;  BHBT  and ortho position refers to  o&#8208;  BHBT  ). Fluorescence emission properties of  p&#8208;  BHBT  and  o&#8208;  BHBT  in THF/water mixtures with different water volume fractions indicated an opposite luminescence in aggregates, in which  p&#8208;  BHBT  showed an ESIPT&#8208;dependent AIE properties while  o&#8208;  BHBT  displayed ESIPT effect and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) qualities. A possible mechanism for molecular actions to illustrate the aggregating luminescence alteration of these two isomers had been proposed and verified by theoretical and experimental studies. More importantly,  Probe&#8208;1  , generated from dual ESIPT&#8208;AIE fluorophore  p&#8208;  BHBT  , was successfully used as a ratiometric fluorescent chemosensor for highly selective (above 15&#8208;fold over other ROS) and sensitive (69&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement with 0.22 &#956;M of detection limit) detection of hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution and living cells, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic reduction of oximes to hydroxylamines: current methods, challenges and opportunities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic reduction of oximes represents a direct efficient approach to synthesize valuable hydroxylamine derivatives. However this transformation presents significant challenges: oximes are hard to reduce and, if reactive, reductive cleavage of the weak N&#8210;O bond often leads to primary amine side products. The first suitable systems involved the use of platinum&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts with hydrogen as reductant and stoichiometric amounts of a strong Br&#248;nsted acid. More recently metal&#8208;free and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based homogeneous catalysts have been developed, which display the highest turnovers (up to 4000). In the asymmetric variants, the  E/Z  &#8208;geometry of the oxime double bond affects significantly the stereoselectivity, sometimes requiring extra synthetic efforts in substrate preparation. This minireview provides an overview of the advances and limitations in catalytic oxime to hydroxylamine reduction. Emphasis is put on highlighting and comparing the practical aspects of the existing methods, such as their reaction conditions and substrate scope. Additionally, future directions for improving this young research area are suggested.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing Cationic &#945;&#8208;Silylated and &#945;&#8208;Germylated Phosphorus Ylides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and full characterization of &#945;&#8208;silylated (&#945;&#8208;SiCPs, 1&#8208;7) and &#945;&#8208;germylated (&#945;&#8208;GeCPs) (11&#8208;13) phosphorus ylides bearing one chloride substituent R3PC(R1)E(Cl)R22 (R = Ph; R1 = Me, Et, Ph; R2 = Me, Et, iPr, Mes; E = Si, Ge) is presented. The molecular structures were determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. The title compounds were applied in halide abstraction studies in order to access cationic species. The reaction of Ph3PC(Me)Si(Cl)Me2 (1) with Na[B(C6F5)4] furnished the dimeric phosphonium&#8208;like dication [Ph3PC(Me)SiMe2]2[B(C6F5)4]2 (8). The highly reactive, mesityl&#8208; or iPr&#8208;substituted cationic species [Ph3PC(Me)SiMes2][B(C6F5)4] (9) and [Ph3PC(Et)SiiPr2][B(C6F5)4] (10) could be characterized by NMR spectroscopy. Carrying out the halide abstraction reaction in the sterically demanding ether iPr2O afforded the protonated &#945;&#8208;SiCP [Ph3PCH(Et)Si(Cl)iPr2][B(C6F5)4] (6dec) by sodium mediated basic ether decomposition, whereas successfully synthesized [Ph3PC(Et)SiiPr2][B(C6F5)4] (10) readily cleaves the F&#8211;C bond in fluorobenzene. Thus, the ambiphilic character of &#945;&#8208;SiCPs is clearly demonstrated. The less reactive germanium analogue [Ph3PC(Me)GeMes2][B(3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3)4] (14) was obtained by reacting 11 with Na[B(3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3)4] and fully characterized including X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Structural parameters indicate a strong CYlide&#8211;Ge interaction with high double bond character, and consequently the C&#8211;E (E = Si, Ge) bonds in 9, 10 and 14 were analyzed with NBO and AIM methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the Effects of Binders in Gas Sorption and Acidity of Aluminum Fumarate Extrudates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the impact of shaping processes on solid adsorbents is critical for the implementation of MOFs in industrial separation processes or as catalytic materials. Production of MOF&#8208;containing shaped particles is typically associated with loss of porosity and modification of acid sites, two phenomena that affect their performance. Herein, we report a detailed study on how extrusion affects the crystallinity, porosity, and acidity of the aluminum fumarate MOF with clays or SiO  2  gel binders.

         <title>Stimuli Induced Uptake of Protein&#8208;Like Peptide Brush Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, we presented a strategy for packaging peptides as side&#8208;chains in high&#8208;density brush polymers. For this globular protein&#8208;like polymer (PLP) formulation, therapeutic peptides were shown to resist proteolytic degradation, enter cells efficiently and maintain biological function. In this paper, we establish the role charge plays in dictating the cellular uptake of these peptide formulations, finding that peptides with a net positive charge will enter cells when polymerized, while those formed from anionic or neutral peptides remain outside of cells. Given these findings, we explored whether cellular uptake could be selectively induced by a stimulus. In our design, a cationic peptide is appended to a sequence of charge&#8208;neutralizing anionic amino acids via stimuli&#8208;responsive cleavable linkers. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we tested this strategy with two different classes of stimuli, exogenous UV light and an enzyme (a matrix metalloproteinase) associated with the inflammatory response. The key finding is that these materials enter cells only when acted upon by the stimulus. This approach makes it possible to achieve delivery of the polymers, therapeutic peptides or an appended cargo into cells in response to an appropriate stimulus.</dc:description>

         <title>Prebiotically plausible autocatalytic peptide amyloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prebiotic emergence of molecules capable of both self&#8208;replication and of storing information was a defining event at the dawn of life. Still, a plausibly prebiotic self&#8208;replication of biologically relevant molecules has not been demonstrated. Building upon the known templating nature of amyloids we present two systems in which the products of a peptide bond&#8208;forming reaction act as self&#8208;replicators to enhance the yield and stereoselectivity of their formation. This first report of an amino acid condensation reaction that can undergo autocatalysis further supports the potential role of amyloids in prebiotic molecular evolution as an environment&#8208;responsive and information&#8208;coding system capable of self&#8208;replication.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination&#8208;induced band gap reduction in a metal&#8208;organic framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report on the synthesis of a microporous, three&#8208;dimensional phosphonate metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) with the composition Cu  3  (H  5  &#8208;MTPPA)  2  &#183;2 NMP (H  8  &#8208;MTPPA = methane tetra&#8208;  p  &#8208;phenylphosphonic acid and NMP = N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidone). This MOF, termed TUB1, has a unique one&#8208;dimensional inorganic building unit composed of square planar and distorted trigonal bipyramidal copper atoms. It possesses a (calculated) BET surface area of 766.2 m  2  /g after removal of the solvents from the voids. The Tauc plot for TUB1 yields indirect and direct band gaps of 2.4 eV and 2.7 eV, respectively. DFT calculations reveal the existence of two spin&#8208;dependent gaps of 2.60 eV and 0.48 eV for the alpha and beta spins, respectively, with the lowest unoccupied crystal orbital for both gaps predominantly residing on the square planar copper atoms. The projected density of states suggests that the presence of the square planar copper atoms reduces the overall band gap of TUB1, as the beta&#8208;gap for the trigonal bipyramidal copper atoms is 3.72 eV.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208; and electrochemical dual&#8208;responsive iridium probe for saccharide detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sensing strategies for dual detection systems are of interest for rapid, accurate data collection in  in vitro  testing. We introduce an Ir(III) complex with a boronic acid binding receptor site on the 2&#8208;phenylpyridine ligand as an ideal probe with photo&#8208; and electro&#8208; chemical signals, sensitive to changes of monosaccharide binding. The complex displays orange luminescence at 618 nm which is reduced in intensity upon binding of the monosaccharides, 70 % and 40% for fructose and glucose, respectively. The electrochemiluminescent signal of the complex shows a direct response to monosaccharide binding. The complex&#8217;s luminescence is also responsive to monosaccharide presence in cancer cells. The Ir(III) complex shows the same response upon incorporation into hydrogel matrices, demonstrating the potential of its integration into a device, as a non&#8208;toxic, simple to use tool to observe sugar binding in physiologically relevant pH ranges and saccharide concentrations.</dc:description>

         <title>Pushing the limits of characterising a weak halogen bond in solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Detection and characterisation of very weak, non&#8208;covalent interactions in solution is inherently challenging. Low affinity, short complex lifetime and a constant battle against entropy brings even the most sensitive spectroscopic methods to their knees. Herein we introduce a strategy for the accurate experimental description of weak chemical forces in solution. Its scope is demonstrated by the detailed geometric and thermodynamic characterisation of the weak halogen bond of a non&#8209;fluorinated aryl iodide and an ether oxygen (0.6&#160;kJ mol  &#8209;1  ). Our approach makes use of the entropic advantage of studying a weak force intramolecularly, embedded into a cooperatively folding system, and of the combined use of NOE&#8208; and RDC&#8208;based ensemble analyses to accurately describe the orientation of the donor and acceptor sites. Thermodynamic constants (&#916;G, &#916;H and &#916;S), describing the specific interaction, were derived from variable temperature chemical shift analysis. We present a methodology for the experimental investigation of remarkably weak halogen bonds and other related weak forces in solution, paving the way for their improved understanding and strategic use in chemistry and biology.</dc:description>

         <title>THE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OF A SECOND METAL ON THE ANTIPROLIFERATIVE PROPERTIES OF THE COMPLEX [Ru(&#951;6&#8208;C10H14)(Cl2)(dmoPTA)].</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

The crystal structure of 1, 3 and 5 were obtained by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Antiproliferative activity of the complexes was evaluated against colon cancer cell line Caco&#8208;2/TC7 by using the MTT protocol. The monometallic ruthenium complexes 1 and 2 were found to be inactive but the bimetallic complexes 3, 4 and 5 display an increased activity (IC  50  3: 9.07&#177;0.27; IC  50  4: 5.40&#177;0.19; IC  50  5: 7.15&#177;0.30 (&#181;M)) compared to cisplatin (IC  50  = 45.6&#177;8.08 &#181;M). Importantly, no reduction in normal cell viability was observed in the presence of the complexes. Experiments targeted to obtain information on the possible action mechanism of complexes were performed such as cell cycle, ROS and gene expression studies. The result obtained showed that the complexes display different properties and action mechanism depending on the nature of metal, M, bonded to the CH  3  N  dmoPTA  atoms.</dc:description>

The crystal structure of 1, 3 and 5 were obtained by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Antiproliferative activity of the complexes was evaluated against colon cancer cell line Caco-2/TC7 by using the MTT protocol.

         <dc:description>The phenomenon of single molecule magnet (SMM) behaviour of mixed valent Mn  12  coordination clusters of general formula [Mn  III  8  Mn  IV  4  O  12  (RCOO)  16  (H  2  O)  4  ] was exemplified by bulk samples of the archetypal [Mn  III  8  Mn  IV  4  O  12  (CH  3  COO)  16  (H  2  O)  4  ] molecule. The molecular origin of the observed magnetic behaviour has found support from extensive studies on the Mn  12  system within crystalline material or on molecules attached to a variety of surfaces. Here we report the magnetic signature of the isolated cationic species [Mn  12  O  12  (CH  3  COO)  15  (CH  3  CN)]  +  by gas phase X&#8208;ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism (XMCD) spectroscopy closely resembling that of the corresponding bulk samples. Furthermore, we report broken symmetry DFT calculations of spin densities and single ion tensors of the isolated, optimized complexes [Mn  12  O  12  (CH  3  COO)  15  (CH  3  CN)]  +  , [Mn  12  O  12  (CH  3  COO)  16  ], [Mn  12  O  12  (CH  3  COO)  16  (H  2  O)  4  ], and [Mn  III  8  Mn  IV  4  O  12  (CH  3  COO)  16  (H  2  O)  4  ]  (bulk geometry)  . The found magnetic fingerprints &#8211; experiment and theory alike &#8208; are of a remarkable robustness: The Mn  IV  4  core bears almost no magnetic anisotropy while the surrounding Mn  III  8  ring is highly anisotropic. These signatures are truly intrinsic properties of the Mn  12  core scaffold within all of these complexes and largely void of the environment. This likely holds irrespective of bulk packing effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Tris(tetramethylguanidinyl)phosphine: The simplest non&#8208;ionic phosphorus superbase and strongly&#8208;donating phosphine ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and properties of the much sought&#8208;after tris(1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylguanidinyl) phosphine P(tmg)  3  , a crystalline, superbasic phosphine accessible through a short and scalable procedure from the cheap and commercially available bulk chemicals 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylguanidine, tris(dimethylamino)phosphine and phosphorus trichloride. The new phosphine exhibits exceptional electron donor properties and readily forms transition metal complexes with gold(I), palladium(II) and rhodium(I) precursors. The formation of zwitterionic Lewis base adducts with carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide was explored. In addition, the complete series of phosphine chalcogenides was prepared from the reaction of P(tmg)  3  with N  2  O and the elemental chalcogens.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This report describes the synthesis of a [2.2]paracyclophane&#8208;derived annulated 3&#8208;amino&#8208;imidazole ligand library  via  a Groebke&#8211;Blackburn&#8211;Bienaym&#233; three&#8208;component reaction (GBB&#8208;3CR) employing formyl&#8208;cyclophanes in combination with diverse aliphatic and aromatic isocyanides and heteroaromatic amidines. The GBB&#8208;3CR gives access to differently functionalized skeletally&#8208;diverse cyclophanyl imidazole ligands, namely 3&#8208;amino&#8208;imidazo[1,2&#8208;  a  ]pyridines and imidazo[1,2&#8208;  a  ]pyrazines. Additionally, a one&#8208;pot protocol for the GBB&#8208;3CR by an  in&#8208;situ  generation of cyclophanyl isocyanide is demonstrated. The product formation was analyzed by detailed spectroscopic techniques, and a cyclophanyl imidazo[1,2&#8208;  a  ]pyridine was confirmed unambiguously by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;Ray crystallography. The cyclophanyl imidazole ligands can be readily transformed to showcase their useful utility in preparing  N  ,  C  &#8208;palladacycles  via  regioselective  ortho  &#8208;palladation.</dc:description>

         <title>Afterglow Implant for Arterial Embolization and Intraoperative Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) is wildly used in clinical treatments. However, the online monitoring of the thrombosis formation is limited due to the challenges of the direct visualization of embolic agents and the real&#8208;time monitoring of dynamic blood flow. Thus, we developed a photochemical afterglow implant with strong afterglow intensity and a long lifetime for embolization and imaging. The liquid pre&#8208;implant injected into the abdominal aorta of mice was rapidly transformed into a hydrogel  in situ  to embolize the blood vessel. The vascular embolism position can be observed by the enhanced afterglow of the fixed implant, and the long lifetime of afterglow can also be used to monitor the effect of embolization. This provides an excellent candidate in bio&#8208;imaging to avoid the autofluorescence interference from continuous light excitation. The study suggests the potential usefulness of the implant as an embolic agent in TAE and artery imaging during a surgical procedure.</dc:description>

         <title>Platinum&#8208;tin/tin oxide/CNT catalysts for high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic ethanol oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethanol is a promising liquid clean energy source in the energy conversion field. However, the self&#8208;poisoning caused by the strongly adsorbed reaction intermediates (typically, CO) is a critical problem in ethanol oxidation reaction. To address this issue, we proposed a joint use of two strategies, alloying of Pt with other metals and building Pt/metal&#8208;oxide interfaces, to achieve high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic ethanol oxidation. For this, a well&#8208;designed synthetic route combining wet impregnation with a two&#8208;step thermal treatment process was established to construct PtSn/SnO  x  interfaces on carbon nanotubes. Using this route, the alloying of Pt&#8208;Sn and formation of PtSn&#8208;SnO  x  interfaces can simultaneously be achieved, and the coverage of SnO  x  thin films on PtSn alloy nanoparticles can be facilely tuned by the strong interaction between Pt and SnO  x  . The results revealed that the partial coverage of SnO  x  species not only retained the active sites, but also enhanced the CO anti&#8208;poisoning ability of the catalyst. Consequently, the H&#8208;PtSn/SnO  x  /CNT&#8208;2 catalyst with an optimized PtSn&#8208;SnO  x  interface showed significantly improved performances toward the ethanol oxidation reaction (825 mA mg  Pt  &#8722;1  ). This study provides deep insights into the structure&#8208;performance relationship of PtSn/metal oxide composite catalysts, which would be helpful for the future design and fabrication of high&#8208;performance Pt&#8208;based ethanol oxidation reaction catalysts.</dc:description>

Consequently, the H-PtSn/SnO  x  /CNT-2 catalyst with an optimized PtSn-SnO  x  interface showed significantly improved performances toward the ethanol oxidation reaction (825 mA mg  Pt  &#8722;1  ). This study provides deep insights into the structure-performance relationship of PtSn/metal oxide composite catalysts, which would be helpful for the future design and fabrication of high-performance Pt-based ethanol oxidation reaction catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
