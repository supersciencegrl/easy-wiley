Warp and weft: The duplication of macroscopic woven structures at the molecular level is always an attractive and promising research field. Herein, we summarize the latest advances in constructing woven polymer networks, and further exhibit the structural superiority of woven topology in regulating physical properties of polymeric materials.







Abstract
Weaving technology has been extensively used for manufacturing macroscopic fabrics and satisfying the artistic demands of humans through the ages. Integrating woven geometries into molecular structures is a persistent pursuit, and yet a significant challenge to chemists, owing to the lack of effective methodologies to guide the regular mutual interlacing of molecular strands. In this Concept article, recent progress and related strategies in constructing woven polymer networks (WPNs) are summarized and discussed. An outlook is then given to highlight the future opportunities and challenges in the development of both molecularly woven structures and molecularly woven functional materials.

         <title>Enhancing the Resistive Switching Behavior of WORM Memory Devices Using D&#8722;&#960;&#8722;A Based Ester&#8208;Flanked Quinolines

Organic memory devices: Ester&#8208;flanked quinoline&#8208;based triarylamines in a donor&#8208;acceptor architecture attributed to a facile intramolecular charge transfer which contributes to a WORM (Write&#8208;Once Read&#8208;Many times) memory characteristic. The structural integrity and stability of the device gives new dimensions to the organic memristors with a balanced charge carrier concept.







Abstract
Donor&#8208;Acceptor systems are highly appreciated in the field of organic memory devices due to their efficient charge transport within the systems. In this work, we have designed and synthesized a D&#8722;&#960;&#8722;A system constituting ester&#8208;flanked quinolines and functionalized triarylamines (TAA) through a single&#8208;step cross&#8208;coupling reaction to fabricate memory devices via Write&#8208;Once Read&#8208;Many times (WORM) non&#8208;volatile memory. Structure&#8208;property relationships are reconnoitered for these conjugated D&#8722;&#960;&#8722;A systems through a series of UV, fluorescence, XRD, DFT, and memory characterizations. The UV and CV data show efficient charge transfer with intramolecular charge transfer occurring at 407&#8211;417&#8197;nm and a short band gap of 2.56&#8211;2.65&#8197;eV. An enhancement in the resistive switching behavior of the memory devices is observed for the compounds with simple TAA&#8208;quinoline and tert&#8208;butylphenyl substituted TAA and fluorophenyl substituted quinoline due to balanced charge distribution in the compounds. This enhanced switching induces an on/off ratio of 103 by generating a highly ordered arrangement in the thin films. The HOMO, LUMO levels, and the ESP images together estimate a charge transfer and charge trapping as the plausible mechanism for the solution&#8208;processable WORM memory devices. The longer retention time (103&#8197;s) and lower threshold voltages (&#8722;1.21&#8211;&#8722;2.12&#8197;V) of the devices makes them intriguing compounds for memory applications.

         <title>Probing a General Strategy to Break the C&#8722;C Bond of Benzene by a Cyclic (Alkyl)(Amino)Aluminyl Anion</title>

Breaking the benzene ring by cyclic (alkyl)(amino)aluminyl anion could become favourable both kinetically and thermodynamically via a general strategy by introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, demonstrated by density functional theory calculations.







Abstract
The oxidative addition of C&#8722;C bonds in aromatic hydrocarbons by low valent main group species has attracted considerable attention from both theoretical and experimental chemists due to the big challenge in breaking their aromaticity. Herein, a general strategy to break the C&#8722;C bonds in benzene by cyclic (alkyl)(amino)aluminyl anion is demonstrated via density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results suggest that the activation of the C&#8722;C bond of benzene by this anion is both kinetically and thermodynamically unfavorable whereas introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups makes such C&#8722;C bond activation becomes favorable both kinetically and thermodynamically. Such a sharp change on the kinetics and thermodynamics could be rationalized by the frontier molecular orbital theory by decreasing the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of the mono&#8208; and disubstituted benzenes. Aromaticity is found to stabilize the transition state for the ring open step. All these findings can help develop the chemistry of small&#8208;molecule activation.

         <title>AuNP&#8208;Modulated qPCR: An Optimized System for Detecting MIR Biophotons Released in DNA Replication

Living systems utilize energy with a high efficiency, but the mechanism remains unclear. Our detection based on an AuNP&#8208;modulated qPCR system shows that 33&#8208; and 84&#8208;THz photons are released by the hydrolysis of dNTP (an energy&#8208;storing molecule like ATP), which efficiently drives DNA replication. Our findings provide a novel method for detecting MIR photons, and pave a way for photon&#8208;based insights to understand the high&#8208;efficiency energy utilization of biology.







Abstract
Living systems can utilize energy with a high efficiency. Biophotons are proposed to modulate biological functions with such efficiency; however, the underlying mechanism remains unexplored, especially due to the challenge of ultraweak mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) light detection and the theoretical perturbation from spontaneous MIR emission. Here, we proposed an optimized system to detect MIR biophotons generated in the hydrolysis of deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs, energy&#8208;storing molecules similar to ATP). The system used a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) that was modulated by gold nanoparticle (AuNP) concentration and thus by the inter&#8208;AuNP distance, which depends on the concentration above. The measurements indicate that 33&#8208; and 84&#8208;THz photons are released by dNTP hydrolysis, which can drive DNA replication. Our findings provide a novel chain&#8208;reaction&#8208;based method for detecting MIR photons in solution, and pave a way for photon&#8208;based insights to understand the highly efficient energy utilization of biology.

Sulphurous lateral interactions. For electroactive coordination polymers, through space charge transport phenomenon are most often 1D. By increasing the size of the electroactive core, lateral sulphur&#8208;sulphur interaction take place and create a 2D conducting pathway. Post&#8208;synthetic oxidation is used to increase the materials conductivity.







Abstract
Novel coordination polymers embedding electroactive moieties present a high interest in the development of porous conducting materials. While tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) based metal&#8208;organic frameworks were reported to yield through&#8208;space conducting frameworks, the use of S&#8208;enriched scaffolds remains elusive in this field. Herein is reported the employment of bis(vinylenedithio)&#8208;tetrathiafulvalene (BVDT&#8208;TTF) functionalized with pyridine coordinating moieties in coordination polymers. Its combination with various transition metals yielded four isostructural networks, whose conductivity increased upon chemical oxidation with iodine. The oxidation was confirmed in a single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiment for the Cd(II) coordination polymer. Raman spectroscopy measurements and DFT calculations confirmed the oxidation state of the bulk materials, and band structure calculations assessed the ground state as an electronically localized antiferromagnetic state, while the conduction occurs in a 2D manner.

     alt="Bis(Vinylenedithio)-Tetrathiafulvalene-Based Coordination Networks"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sulphurous lateral interactions&lt;/b&gt;. For electroactive coordination polymers, through space charge transport phenomenon are most often 1D. By increasing the size of the electroactive core, lateral sulphur-sulphur interaction take place and create a 2D conducting pathway. Post-synthetic oxidation is used to increase the materials conductivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel coordination polymers embedding electroactive moieties present a high interest in the development of porous conducting materials. While tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) based metal-organic frameworks were reported to yield through-space conducting frameworks, the use of S-enriched scaffolds remains elusive in this field. Herein is reported the employment of bis(vinylenedithio)-tetrathiafulvalene (BVDT-TTF) functionalized with pyridine coordinating moieties in coordination polymers. Its combination with various transition metals yielded four isostructural networks, whose conductivity increased upon chemical oxidation with iodine. The oxidation was confirmed in a single-crystal to single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiment for the Cd(II) coordination polymer. Raman spectroscopy measurements and DFT calculations confirmed the oxidation state of the bulk materials, and band structure calculations assessed the ground state as an electronically localized antiferromagnetic state, while the conduction occurs in a 2D manner.

         <title>A Triazolium&#8208;Anchored Self&#8208;Immolative Linker Enables Self&#8208;Assembly&#8208;Driven siRNA Binding and Esterase&#8208;Induced Release</title>

Self&#8208;assembled triazolium&#8208;based amphiphiles lose the ability to bind siRNA upon addition of esterase, due to the degradation of the polar head group and conversion to a neutral triazole.







Abstract
The increased importance of RNA&#8208;based therapeutics comes with a need to develop next&#8208;generation stimuli&#8208;responsive systems capable of binding, transporting and releasing RNA oligomers. In this work, we describe triazolium&#8208;based amphiphiles capable of siRNA binding and enzyme&#8208;responsive release of the nucleic acid payload. In aqueous medium, the amphiphile self&#8208;assembles into nanocarriers that can disintegrate upon the addition of esterase. Key to the molecular design is a self&#8208;immolative linker that is anchored to the triazolium moiety and acts as a positively&#8208;charged polar head group. We demonstrate that addition of esterase leads to a degradation cascade of the linker, leaving the neutral triazole compound unable to form complexes and therefore releasing the negatively&#8208;charged siRNA. The reported molecular design and overall approach may have broad utility beyond this proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study, because the underlying CuAAC &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry allows bringing together three groups very efficiently as well as cleaving off one of the three groups under the mild action of an esterase enzyme.

         <title>Electrophile&#8208;Promoted Nucleophilic Cyclization of 2&#8208;Alkynylindoles to Give 4&#8208;Substituted Oxazinoindolones</title>

Synthesis of 4&#8208;organoselanyl oxazinoindolones by the cascade cyclization of N&#8208;(alkoxycarbonyl)&#8208;2&#8208;alkynylindoles using iron(III) chloride and diorganyl diselenides as promoters was developed.







Abstract
A method for the synthesis of 4&#8208;organoselanyl oxazinoindolone derivatives by the cascade cyclization of N&#8208;(alkoxycarbonyl)&#8208;2&#8208;alkynylindoles using iron(III) chloride and diorganyl diselenides as promoters was developed. This protocol was applied to a series of N&#8208;(alkoxycarbonyl)&#8208;2&#8208;alkynylindoles containing different substituents. The reaction conditions also tolerated a variety of diorganyl diselenides having both electron donating and electron withdrawing groups. However, the reaction did not work for diorganyl disulfides and ditellurides. The reaction mechanism seems to proceed via an ionic pathway and the cooperative action between iron(III) chloride and diorganyl diselenides is crucial for successful cyclization. We also found that using the same starting materials, by simply changing the electrophilic source to iodine, led to the formation of 4&#8208;iodo&#8208;oxazinoindolones. The high reactivity of Csp2&#8722;Se and Csp2&#8722;I bonds were tested under cross&#8208;coupling conditions leading to the preparation of a new class of functionalized indole derivatives. In addition, the absorption, emission and electrochemical properties of 4&#8208;organoselanyl oxazinoindolones showed an important relationship with the substituents of the aromatic rings. The advantages of the methodology include the use of electrophilic to promote the cyclization reaction and functionalization of the indole ring, and the electronic properties presented by the prepared compounds can be exploited as probes, analyte detectors and optical materials.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Perfluoroalkylvinylation of Alkenes Enabled by Dual DBU/Fe Catalysis

The first example of an efficient DBU/iron co&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component perfluoroalkylvinylation of alkenes has been reported through a radical process under mild conditions.







Abstract
Herein, a simple and efficient strategy that involves dual 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene (DBU)/iron&#8208;catalyzed alkene perfluoroalkylvinylation by using perfluoroalkyl iodides and 2&#8208;aminonaphthalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones as coupling partners is demonstrated. In terms of the developed catalytic system, various styrenes and aliphatic alkenes are well&#8208;tolerated, leading to the accurate preparation of perfluoroalkyl&#8208;containing 2&#8208;aminonaphthalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones in excellent regioselectivity. Moreover, the protocol can be readily applied in late&#8208;stage modifications of natural products and pharmaceuticals. The title reactions are featured by easily accessible and inexpensive catalysts and substrates, broad substrate applicability, and mild reaction conditions. Mechanistic investigations reveal a tandem C&#8722;I cleavable alkylation and C&#8722;C vinylation enabled by cooperative DBU/iron catalysis.

Fast and bright! The inverse electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of the synthetic tetrazine&#8208;modified dyes with bicyclononyne&#8208;modified DNA follow the new concept of the two&#8208;factor fluorescence fluorogenicity which improves the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio such that washing procedures prior to cell imaging are not needed. The labelling reactions proceed also extremely fast.







Abstract
Two green fluorescent tetrazine&#8208;modified cyanine&#8208;styryl dyes were synthesized for bioorthogonal labelling of DNA by means of the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with inverse electron demand. With DNA as target biopolymer the fluorescence of these dyes is released by two factors: (i) sterically by their interaction with DNA, and (ii) structurally via the conjugated tetrazine as quencher moiety. As a result, the reaction with bicyclononyne&#8208;modified DNA is significantly accelerated up to &#8805;284,000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, and the fluorescence turn&#8208;on is enhanced up to 560 by the two&#8208;factor fluorogenicity. These dyes are cell permeable even in low concentrations and undergo fluorogenic reactions with BCN&#8208;modified DNA in living HeLa cells. The two&#8208;factor fluorescence release improves the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio such that washing procedures prior to cell imaging are not needed, which is a great advantage for live cell imaging of DNA and RNA in the future.

         <dc:description>
Foeniculoxin is a major phytotoxin produced by Italian strains of Phomopsis foeniculi. In this study, the first total synthesis, absolute configuration, and phytotoxic activity are described. Foeniculoxin and hygromycin B caused similar agglomeration of mitochondria around chloroplasts, highlighting this event as a common component in the early stages of plant cell death.







Abstract
Foeniculoxin is a major phytotoxin produced by Italian strains of Phomopsis foeniculi. The first total synthesis is described utilizing the ene reaction and Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction as key steps. The absolute configuration of the C6&#8217; was determined using chiral separation and an advanced Mosher's method. The phytotoxicity of the synthesized compound was demonstrated via syringe&#8208;based infiltration into Chenopodium album and Arabidopsis thaliana leaves. Synthetic foeniculoxin induced various defects in A.&#8197;thaliana leaf cells before lesion formation, including protein leakage into the cytoplasm from both chloroplasts and mitochondria and mitochondrial rounding and swelling. Furthermore, foeniculoxin and the antibiotic hygromycin B caused similar agglomeration of mitochondria around chloroplasts, highlighting this event as a common component in the early stages of plant cell death.

         <title>Smart Phototheranostics based on Carbon Nanohorns for Precise Imaging&#8208;Guided Post&#8208;PDT toward Residual Tumor Cells after Initial Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 8, February 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking advantage of the multi&#8208;stimulus response to exogenous laser and endogenous hyaluronidase, the HA&#8722;Ce6@SWNHs inhibited the growth of residual tumor cells after photodynamic therapy (PDT)/photothermal therapy (PTT) through activatable imaging&#8208;guided PDT. This work provides a rational strategy to develop smart SWNHs&#8208;based phototheranostics for the programmable design of multiple stimulus responses in precision medicine.







Abstract
As promising photonic material, phototheranostics can be activated in the laser irradiation range of tumor with sensitivity and spatiotemporal precision. However, it is difficult to completely eradicate solid tumors due to their irregularity and limited laser irradiation area. Herein, multi&#8208;stimulus responsive HA&#8722;Ce6@SWNHs were constructed with single&#8208;walled carbon nanohorns (SWNHs) and chlorine e6 (Ce6) modified hyaluronic acid (HA) via non&#8208;covalent binding. This SWNHs&#8208;based phototheranostics not only exhibited water dispersion but also could target tumor and be activated by near&#8208;infrared light for photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT). Additionally, HA&#8722;Ce6@SWNHs could be degraded by hyaluronidase in residual tumor cells, causing HA&#8722;Ce6 to fall off the SWNHs surfaces to restore autofluorescence, thus precisely guiding the programmed photodynamic treatments for residual tumor cells after the initial phototherapy. Thus, this work provides a rationally designed multiple&#8208;stimulus&#8208;response strategy to develop smart SWNHs&#8208;based phototheranostics for precise PDT/PTT and post&#8208;treatment imaging&#8208;guided PDT of residual tumor cells.

         <title>Stabilization of Potent Co(II)&#8208;based Lewis Acids with Weakly Basic Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 8, February 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tame, but not too much. Complexation of Co(II) with weakly Lewis&#8208;basic ligands yields complexes with calculated Fluoride Ion Affinity in CH2Cl2 solution comparable to SbF5 &#8208; a benchmark for Lewis superacidity. Stabilization with weakly coordinating anion {Al[OC(CF3)3]4}&#8722; allows isolation of such complexes in the form of easily storable salts and their thorough characterization.







Abstract
Pairing cations with weakly coordinating anions (WCAs) often renders them highly Lewis&#8208;acidic and extremely reactive. Although these features are often desirable, excessive reactivity of a cation may lead to decomposition of solvents or WCAs, hindering isolation, storage and practical use of such species. In an attempt to mitigate the problem, we introduce a series of readily available novel Co(II)&#8208;WCA salts with the metal center stabilized by weakly bound ligands: SO2, halogenated acetonitriles and nitromethane with comprehensive characterization including structural, magnetic and spectral (IR) properties as well as thermal stability assessment. The use of these simple yet rarely encountered ligands yields mostly stable and highly Lewis&#8208;acidic complexes, in some cases comparable to SbF5 according to calculated Fluoride Ion Affinities. Highly acidic character of the species is also reflected in observed reactivity. Since the most convenient route towards the Co(II) complexes leads through silver salts, the results are complemented with characterization of a series of novel Ag(I) complexes with abovementioned ligands. Experimental part is backed with DFT calculations which gives insight into the structure and energetics of presented Co(II) complexes and shows that Co(II) center is available for substrates like olefins. This makes them good candidates for catalysts in reactions requiring the presence of Lewis acids.

         <title>Siderophore&#8208;Linked Ruthenium Catalysts for Targeted Allyl Ester Prodrug Activation within Bacterial Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 8, February 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ganging up on bacteria: Siderophore&#8208;linked ruthenium catalysts were investigated for the activation of an antibacterial prodrug within cells. A fluoroquinolone prodrug was developed and shown to be compatible with the catalysts under micro&#8208;aerobic, biologically relevant conditions. The co&#8208;addition of the catalysts and prodrug to E.&#8197;coli showed a combinative effect, with the dihydroxybenzoic acid&#8208; and azotochelin&#8208;linked catalysts showing most promise for cellular uptake and thus intracellular prodrug activation.







Abstract
Due to rising resistance, new antibacterial strategies are needed, including methods for targeted antibiotic release. As targeting vectors, chelating molecules called siderophores that are released by bacteria to acquire iron have been investigated for conjugation to antibacterials, leading to the clinically approved drug cefiderocol. The use of small&#8208;molecule catalysts for prodrug activation within cells has shown promise in recent years, and here we investigate siderophore&#8208;linked ruthenium catalysts for the activation of antibacterial prodrugs within cells. Moxifloxacin&#8208;based prodrugs were synthesised, and their catalyst&#8208;mediated activation was demonstrated under anaerobic, biologically relevant conditions. In the absence of catalyst, decreased antibacterial activities were observed compared to moxifloxacin versus Escherichia coli K12 (BW25113). A series of siderophore&#8208;linked ruthenium catalysts were investigated for prodrug activation, all of which displayed a combinative antibacterial effect with the prodrug, whereas a representative example displayed little toxicity against mammalian cell lines. By employing complementary bacterial growth assays, conjugates containing siderophore units based on catechol and azotochelin were found to be most promising for intracellular prodrug activation.

         <title>Going Viral: An Investigation into the Chameleonic Behaviour of Antiviral Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 8, February 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
NMR spectroscopy revealed three antiviral drugs in the bRo5 space to behave as &#8220;partial&#8221; molecular chameleons. Their ability to adopt conformations with low polar surface area is proposed to improve their cell permeability and contribute to oral absorption. A fourth drug was found not to be chameleonic.







Abstract
The ability to adjust conformations in response to the polarity of the environment, i.e. molecular chameleonicity, is considered to be important for conferring both high aqueous solubility and high cell permeability to drugs in chemical space beyond Lipinski's rule of 5. We determined the conformational ensembles populated by the antiviral drugs asunaprevir, simeprevir, atazanavir and daclatasvir in polar (DMSO&#8208;d6) and non&#8208;polar (chloroform) environments with NMR spectroscopy. Daclatasvir was fairly rigid, whereas the first three showed large flexibility in both environments, that translated into major differences in solvent accessible 3D polar surface area within each conformational ensemble. No significant differences in size and polar surface area were observed between the DMSO&#8208;d6 and chloroform ensembles of these three drugs. We propose that such flexible compounds are characterized as &#8220;partial molecular chameleons&#8221; and hypothesize that their ability to adopt conformations with low polar surface area contributes to their membrane permeability and oral absorption.

&lt;p&gt;NMR spectroscopy revealed three antiviral drugs in the bRo5 space to behave as &#8220;partial&#8221; molecular chameleons. Their ability to adopt conformations with low polar surface area is proposed to improve their cell permeability and contribute to oral absorption. A fourth drug was found not to be chameleonic.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to adjust conformations in response to the polarity of the environment, i.e. molecular chameleonicity, is considered to be important for conferring both high aqueous solubility and high cell permeability to drugs in chemical space beyond Lipinski's rule of 5. We determined the conformational ensembles populated by the antiviral drugs asunaprevir, simeprevir, atazanavir and daclatasvir in polar (DMSO-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) and non-polar (chloroform) environments with NMR spectroscopy. Daclatasvir was fairly rigid, whereas the first three showed large flexibility in both environments, that translated into major differences in solvent accessible 3D polar surface area within each conformational ensemble. No significant differences in size and polar surface area were observed between the DMSO-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and chloroform ensembles of these three drugs. We propose that such flexible compounds are characterized as &#8220;partial molecular chameleons&#8221; and hypothesize that their ability to adopt conformations with low polar surface area contributes to their membrane permeability and oral absorption.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bimetallic Organic Framework&#8208;Decorated Leaf&#8208;like 2D Nanosheets as Flexible Air Cathode for Rechargeable Zn&#8208;air Batteries</title>

A bimetallic self&#8208;supporting electrode with 3D structure was synthesized. The electrode was composed of Cu, Co nanoparticles co&#8208;modified with nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheet (Cu, Co NPs@NCNSs/CC) on a carbon cloth. The dual&#8208;metal CuCo sites provide efficient ORR and OER electrocatalytic activity by the synergistic effect, thus reducing the energetic barrier.







Abstract
Exploring highly active and robust self&#8208;supporting air electrodes is the key for flexible Zn&#8208;air batteries (FZABs). Therefore, we report a novel 3D structural bimetal&#8208;based self&#8208;supporting electrode consisting of hybrid Cu, Co nanoparticles co&#8208;modified nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets on carbon cloth (Cu, Co NPs@NCNSs/CC), which displays excellent electrochemical activity and durability of the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER). The Cu, Co NPs@NCNSs/CC exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.863&#8197;V toward ORR and an overpotential of 225&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 toward OER, owing to its exposed bimetallic sites accelerating the kinetic reaction. In addition, the density functional theory calculation proves that the synergistic effect of CuCo sites favors ORR and OER. Hence, the FZABs based on Cu, Co NPs@NCNSs/CC achieve a larger open&#8208;circuit potential (1.45&#8197;V), higher energy density (130.10&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and outstanding cycling stability. All remarkable results demonstrate valuable enlightenment for seeking advanced energy materials of portable and wearable electronics.

         <title>Caging of a Strongly Pairing Fluorescent Thymidine Analog with Soft Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 8, February 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Releasing the base pairing partner: A pyridone C&#8208;nucleoside is reported that binds very tightly to adenine as complementary base. Upon exposure to soft nucleophiles, such as glutathione or selenocysteine, the new base reacts and releases its grip on the base pairing partner, allowing for the dissociation of duplexes. At the same time, the C&#8208;nucleoside changes its fluorescence signature, providing a visual signal for the transformation.







Abstract
Controlling the pairing strength of nucleobases in DNA through reactions with compounds found inside the cell is a formidable challenge. Here we report how a thiazolyl substituent turns a strongly pairing ethynylpyridone C&#8208;nucleoside into a reactive residue in oligonucleotides. The thiazolyl&#8208;bearing pyridone reacts with soft nucleophiles, such as glutathione, but not with hard nucleophiles like hydroxide or carbonate. The addition products pair much more weakly with adenine in a complementary strand than the starting material, and also change their fluorescence. This makes oligonucleotides containing the new deoxynucleoside interesting for controlled release. Due to its reactivity toward N, P, S, and Se&#8208;nucleophiles, and the visual signal accompanying chemical conversion, the fluorescent nucleotide reported here may also have applications in chemical biology, sensing and diagnostics.

Prebiotic sugars: An investigation of carbonyl migration and epimerization, proceeding down the entire carbon chain of tetrose sugars (d&#8208;erythrose and d&#8208;threose) in aqueous media, and ultimately leading to a mixture of d&#8208;erythrulose, rac&#8208;erythrulose and rac&#8208;tetroses arising from the above reactions, is presented in this study.







Abstract
The prebiotic generation of sugars in the context of origins of life studies is of considerable interest. Among the important intramolecular processes of sugars are carbonyl migrations and accompanying epimerizations. Herein we describe the carbonyl migration&#8208;epimerization process occurring down the entire carbon chain of chirally pure d&#8208;tetroses sugars under mild conditions. Employing chirally pure 1&#8208;13C&#8208;erythrose, 4&#8208;13C&#8208;erythrose and 1&#8208;13C&#8208;threose, we (1) identify all the species formed as the carbonyl migrates down the four&#8208;carbon chain and (2) assess the rates associated with the production of each of these species. Competing aldol reactions and oxidative fragmentation processes were also observed. Further observations of self&#8208;condensation of glycolaldehyde mainly yielding 2&#8208;keto&#8208;hexoses (sorbose and tagatose) and tetrulose also provides a basis for understanding the effect of carbonyl migrations on the product distribution in plausible prebiotic scenarios.

         <title>Formation, Reactivity and Decomposition of Aryl Phospha&#8208;Enolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 8, February 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and reactivity of two lithium phospha&#8208;enolates [RP=C(SiiPr3)OLi]2 (R=Mes, Mes*) is described. Derivatization at the oxygen atom with electrophiles is possible, facilitating subsequent reactivity pathways including, for example, spontaneous decarbonylation.







Abstract
Two lithium phospha&#8208;enolates [RP=C(SiiPr3)OLi]2 were prepared by reaction of triisopropyl silyl phosphaethynolate, iPr3SiPCO, with aryl lithium reagents LiR (R=Mes: 1,3,5&#8208;trimethyl phenyl; or Mes*: 1,3,5,&#8208;tri&#8208;tertbutyl phenyl). Monomer/dimer aggregation of the enolates can be modulated by addition of 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4. Substitution of lithium for a heavier alkali metal was achieved through initial formation of a silyl enol ether, followed by reaction with KOtBu to form the corresponding potassium phospha&#8208;enolate [MesP=C(SiiPr3)OK]2. On addition of water, the enolates are protonated to afford RP=C(SiiPr3)(OH). For the sterically less demanding system (R=Mes), this phospha&#8208;enol rapidly tautomerises to the corresponding acyl phosphine MesP(H)C(SiiPr3)(O), which on heating extrudes CO. In contrast, bulkier phospha&#8208;enol (R=Mes*) is stable to rearrangement at room temperature and thermally decomposes to RH and iPr3SiPCO.

         <title>Terminal Au&#8722;N and Au&#8722;O Units in Organometallic Frames</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 8, February 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Landscape beyond the oxo&#8208;wall. The terminal auronitrene and auroxyl species [(CF3)3AuN]&#8722; and [(CF3)3AuO]&#8722; are identified as local minima by calculation and experimentally detected by tandem mass spectrometry (MS2) in the gas phase. These open&#8208;shell species defy the standard rules to assign oxidation states since the unpaired electrons are located on the terminal monoatomic ligand (N and O) rather than on the metal.







Abstract
Since gold is located well beyond the oxo wall, chemical species with terminal Au&#8722;N and Au&#8722;O units are extremely rare and limited to low coordination numbers. We report here that these unusual units can be trapped within a suitable organometallic frame. Thus, the terminal auronitrene and auroxyl derivatives [(CF3)3AuN]&#8722; and [(CF3)3AuO]&#8722; were identified as local minima by calculation. These open&#8208;shell, high&#8208;energy ions were experimentally detected by tandem mass spectrometry (MS2): They respectively arise by N2 or NO2 dissociation from the corresponding precursor species [(CF3)3Au(N3)]&#8722; and [(CF3)3Au(ONO2)]&#8722; in the gas phase. Together with the known fluoride derivative [(CF3)3AuF]&#8722;, they form an interesting series of isoleptic and alloelectronic complexes of the highly acidic organogold(iii) moiety (CF3)3Au with singly charged anions X&#8722; of the most electronegative elements (X=F, O, N). Ligand&#8208;field inversion in all these [(CF3)3AuX]&#8722; species results in the localization of unpaired electrons at the N and O atoms.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Formylation of Unactivated Alkyl Chlorides to Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 8, February 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and convenient rhodium&#8208;catalyzed formylation of alkyl chlorides to synthesize aldehydes has been developed. Depending on the conditions both linear and branched aldehydes can be obtained in a selective manner from readily available substrates.







Abstract
The first rhodium&#8208;catalyzed formylation of non&#8208;activated alkyl chlorides with syn gas (H2/CO) allows to produce aldehydes in high yields (25 examples). A catalyst optimization study revealed Rh(acac)(CO)2 in the presence of 1,3&#8208;bisdiphenylphosphinopropane (DPPP) as the most active catalyst system for this transformation. Key for the success of the reaction is the addition of sodium iodide (NaI) to the reaction system, which leads to the formation of activated alkyl iodides as intermediates. Depending on the reaction conditions, either the linear or branched aldehydes can be preferentially obtained, which is explained by a different mechanism.

         <title>Synthesis, Structures, and Properties of &#960;&#8208;Extended Phosphindolizine Derivatives</title>

Get more from a larger pi: Four &#960;&#8208;extended phosphindolizine derivatives have been synthesized and characterized. The positions and the additional fusion of benzene rings (colored in the figure) considerably changed the molecular structures, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, and the photoluminescence properties.







Abstract
Dibenzo[b,g]phosphindolizine oxide and three types of benzo[e]naphthophosphindolizine oxides have been synthesized by the ring&#8208;closing metathesis of benzo[b]phosphole oxide and naphthophosphole oxides with two olefin tethers. Their molecular structures and properties were revealed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, and electrochemical analysis. The number and position of the benzene rings were found to alter the structural geometry and the HOMO/LUMO energy levels, and their effects were investigated by theoretical calculations. Among the phosphindolizine oxide derivatives investigated, only benzo[e]naphtho[2,3&#8208;b]phosphindolizine oxide with the naphthalene ring fused at 2,3&#8208;positions showed weak yellow fluorescence with a large Stokes shift.

         <title>Bis(amidophenolato)phosphonium: Si&#8722;H Hydride Abstraction and Phosphorus&#8208;Ligand Cooperative Activation of C&#8722;C Multiple Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 8, February 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first donor&#8208;free bis(amidophenolato)phosphonium ions were prepared, and their reactivity was investigated. The compounds possess extreme Lewis acidity up to the strongest monocationic phosphonium&#8208;based fluoride ion acceptor isolable to date. Numerous novel phosphorus&#8208;ligand cooperative reaction modes were observed toward silanes and unsaturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds.







Abstract
The first bis(amidophenolato)phosphonium salts are prepared and fully characterized. The perfluorinated derivative represents the strongest monocationic phosphorus Lewis acid on the fluoride and hydride ion affinity scale isolable to date. This affinity enables new reactions, such as hydride abstraction from Et3SiH, the first phosphaalkoxylation of an alkyne or a phosphorus catalyzed intramolecular hydroarylation. All properties and reactions are scrutinized by theory and experiment. Substantial &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;acidity provides the required affinity for substrate activation, while phosphorus&#8208;ligand cooperativity substantially enriches the reactivity portfolio of phosphonium ions.

The preparation of N&#8208;2&#8208;Nitrophenylsulfenyl imino dipeptides bearing various functional groups was successfully achieved using MnO2&#8208;mediated oxidation. Also the highly diastereoselective indolylation of the iminopeptides was realized, which allows selective access to each diastereomer of the adduct from the same substrate using an appropriate chiral phosphoric acid catalyst. The origin of the diastereoselectivity was elucidated by DFT calculations.







Abstract
N&#8208;2&#8208;Nitrophenylsulfenyl imino dipeptides bearing various functional groups were successfully prepared by MnO2&#8208;mediated oxidation and then subjected to diastereoselective indolylation. Each diastereomer of the adduct was selectively obtained from the same substrates using the appropriate chiral phosphoric acid catalysts. These transformations would be useful for synthesizing non&#8208;canonical amino acid&#8208;containing peptides as novel drug candidates.

         <title>Complexation Preferences of Dynamic Constitutional Frameworks as Adaptive Gene Vectors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 8, February 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic constitutional frameworks: 40 different amphiphilic dynamic constitutional frameworks were prepared in a stepwise covalent self&#8208;assembly process and their DNA complexation preferences revealed marked differences, not only as a function of the number and type of cationic headgroups, but also as a function of the type of DNA, yielding distinct polyplex architectures.







Abstract
The growing applications of therapeutic nucleic acids requires the concomitant development of vectors that are optimized to complex one type of nucleic acid, forming nanoparticles suitable for further trafficking and delivery. While fine&#8208;tuning a vector by molecular engineering to obtain a particular nanoscale organization at the nanoparticle level can be a challenging endeavor, we turned the situation around and instead screened the complexation preferences of dynamic constitutional frameworks toward different types of DNAs. Dynamic constitutional frameworks (DCF) are recently&#8208;identified vectors by our group that can be prepared in a versatile manner through dynamic covalent chemistry. Herein, we designed and synthesized 40 new DCFs that vary in hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance, number of cationic headgroups. The results of DNA complexation obtained through gel electrophoresis and fluorescent displacement assays reveal binding preferences of different DCFs toward different DNAs. The formation of compact spherical architectures with an optimal diameter of 100&#8211;200&#8197;nm suggests that condensation into nanoparticles is more effective for longer PEG chains and PEI groups that induce a better binding performance in the presence of DNA targets.

         <title>Differences in the Reactivity of Geminal Si&#8722;O&#8722;P and Al&#8722;O&#8722;P Frustrated Lewis Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 8, February 7, 2023. </description>

Variations in reactivity are observed for the geminal Si&#8722;O&#8722;P and Al&#8722;O&#8722;P Frustrated Lewis Pairs tBu2P&#8722;O&#8722;Si(C2F5)3 and tBu2P&#8722;O&#8722;Al(CH(SiMe3)2)2 towards CO2, nitriles and alkynes regarding regioselectivity, structure and stability of the corresponding adducts.







Abstract
The new oxygen&#8208;bridged geminal Si/P Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP) tBu2P&#8722;O&#8722;Si(C2F5)3 (2) is able to reversibly bind carbon dioxide at ambient temperature. We compared its reactivity towards benzil, but&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;one, nitriles and phenylacetylene to that of the Al/P FLP tBu2P&#8722;O&#8722;AlBis2 (Bis=&#8722;CH(SiMe3)2) (1). When reacted with benzil, both, 1 and 2, form the 1,2&#8208;addition product, but in the Si/P FLP 2, the second carbonyl function additionally binds to the silicon atom. With but&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;one 2 forms the 1,2&#8208;addition product, while 1 binds in 1,4&#8208;position. The reaction with acetonitrile yielded an unexpected etheneimine adduct for both systems, while only 1 reacted with tert&#8208;butylnitrile. With benzonitrile and acrylonitrile, 2 showed reversible addition to the C&#8801;N bond and 1 forms a stable adduct with benzonitrile. Solely 1 shows reactivity towards phenylacetylene affording a mixture of the CH deprotonation adduct tBu2P(H)&#8722;O&#8722;AlBis2(CCPh) and the FLP &#8722;C&#8801;C 1,2&#8208;addition adduct under ring formation. All compounds were characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, XRD and elemental analysis.

         <title>Frontispiece: Recent Status and Developments of Vacancies Modulation in the ABO3 Perovskites for Catalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 8, February 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of ABO3 could promote the development of many chemical engineering processes as catalysts. Meanwhile the creation and improvement of ABO3 with different site vacancies would further enhance its commercial progress due to the possibility of strengthening its physical&#8208;chemical properties. In this Review article by J. Chen et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;3 ff., the preparation methods of ABO3 with A&#8208;site, B&#8208;site, and O&#8208;site vacancies; the improved electronic structure as well as an activated lattice oxygen of vacancies&#8208;enriched ABO3; and the corresponding reaction mechanism are discussed in detail. In particular, this effective strategy also guides ABO3&#8217; development as electrode materials for energy storage, photovoltaic material for producing energy, and sensor materials for equipment production, etc.

         <title>Cover Feature: Synthesis, Structures, and Properties of &#960;&#8208;Extended Phosphindolizine Derivatives (Chem. Eur. J. 8/2023)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 8, February 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four &#960;&#8208;extended phosphindolizine derivatives have been newly synthesized and characterized. We express these compounds as four hayabusa (falcons) that are taking off from a nest (shown lower right), which indicates the dibenzo[b,e]phosphindolizines reported previously. We also describe the weak luminescence of one compound (shown upper left) as shining under the sun. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Tsurusaki, K. Kamikawa, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203321). Artwork by Norifumi Kosaka of YAP Inc.

ATP, the cell energy currency mostly produced by mitochondria, is conventionally regarded as releasing heat to drive biological reactions and processes. By employing dNTPs (i.&#8201;e., energy molecules that have an identical way of storing/releasing energy to ATP), we demonstrated that ATP hydrolysis can release photons with a specific mid&#8208;infrared frequency to efficiently drive DNA replication. More information can be found in the Research Article by L. Jiang, B. Song, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203513).

         <title>Closed Bipolar Electrode Array for Optical Reporting Reaction&#8208;Coupled Electrochemical Sensing and Imaging</title>

Powerful sensing and imaging abilities: This review highlights the recent advances in closed bipolar electrode (BPE) arrays using an electro&#8208;fluorochromism (EFC) or electro&#8208;chemiluminescence (ECL) reaction as the reporting reaction to realize sensing and imaging. It demonstrates the advantages of a closed BPE array, such as the physical separation of two poles, the independence of each electrode, and the simplicity and controllability of the system.







Abstract
This review centers on a closed bipolar electrode (BPE) array using an electro&#8208;fluorochromism (EFC) or electro&#8208;chemiluminescence (ECL) reaction as the reporting reaction. Electrochemical signals at one pole of the closed BPE array can be transduced into the EFC or ECL signals at the opposite pole. Therefore, the current signal of a redox reaction can be easily detected and imaged by monitoring the luminescence signal. Recent developments in closed BPE array&#8208;based EFC and ECL sensing and imaging are summarized and discussed in detail. Finally, we consider the challenges and opportunities for improving the spatial resolution of closed BPE array&#8208;based electrochemical imaging, and emphasize the important application of this technique to the imaging of cellular activities at the single&#8208;cell level.

         <title>Recent Status and Developments of Vacancies Modulation in the ABO3 Perovskites for Catalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 8, February 7, 2023. </description>

The modification of ABO3 with different sites vacancies could optimize its physical&#8211;chemical properties, thereby enhancing its performance at catalytic redox reactions, energy storage, gas sensor, photovoltaics, etc, which exhibiting the potential of the commercial applications.







Abstract
Perovskite oxides (ABO3) have attracted comprehensive interest for wide range of functional applications (especially for chemical catalysis) due to their high design flexibility, controllable vacancies sites creation, abundant chemical properties, and stable crystal structure. Herein, the previous research and potential development of ABO3 through adjusting the vacancy at different sites (A&#8208;site, B&#8208;site, and O&#8208;site) to enhance catalytic performance are systematically analyzed and generalized. Briefly, the ABO3 with different vacancies sites prepared by multifarious direct and indirect methods, accompanied with the improved physical&#8208;chemical properties, endow them with distinct and intensified development of catalysis application. In addition, the impressive optimization proved by the vacancies sites adjustment over the ABO3 is studied to continuously facilitate the advance in some common catalysis reactions, further expanding to other optimized functional applications. At last, the constructive suggestions for fine regulation and analysis of vacancies sites over ABO3 are also put forward.

         <title>Construction of Y&#8208;Doped BiVO4 Photocatalysts for Efficient Two&#8208;Electron O2 Reduction to H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production on BiVO4 photocatalysts using water and oxygen as raw materials is a green and sustainable process. However, the photocatalytic efficiency of pristine BiVO4 is limited by severe charge recombination. In this work, the rare earth element Yttrium (Y) doped BiVO4 photocatalysts are fabricated via the hydrothermal method. In the photocatalytic H2O2 production experiment, the optimized Y&#8208;doped BiVO4 photocatalyst produces 114 &#181;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 of H2O2 under simulated sunlight (AM1.5) irradiation, which is four times that of pure BiVO4 (26 &#181;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1). Density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that Y doping can enhance oxygen adsorption on the BiVO4 photocatalyst surface. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the doping process induces the in situ formation of monoclinic/tetragonal BiVO4 heterojunction, which further promotes the photogenerated carriers separation efficiency.</dc:description>

In the photocatalytic H2O2 production experiment, the optimized Y-doped BiVO4 photocatalyst produces 114 &#181;mol g-1 h-1 of H2O2 under simulated sunlight (AM1.5) irradiation, which is four times that of pure BiVO4 (26 &#181;mol g-1 h-1). Density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that Y doping can enhance oxygen adsorption on the BiVO4 photocatalyst surface. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the doping process induces the in situ formation of monoclinic/tetragonal BiVO4 heterojunction, which further promotes the photogenerated carriers separation efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Neutral Monodentate and Hypervalent Chalcogen Bond Catalysis on the Intramolecular Rauhut&#8208;Currier Reaction of Bis(enones): A DFT Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, the green and high efficient of chalcogen bond (ChB) catalysis has been aroused great interest. In this work, the ChB catalysis has been applied to the intramolecular Rauhut&#8208;Currier (RC) reaction of bis(enones). The mechanism was divided into four processes: the promoter addition process, the carbon&#8208;carbon bond coupling process, the hydrogen transfer process, and the promoter elimination process. This study shows that the ChB catalyst could act on the promoter and reactant in the RC reaction, respectively. And the path2 of ChB catalyst direct acting on the reactant is considered to be a relatively favorable channel of the reaction due to a lower energy barrier. In addition, all six catalysts could achieve good catalytic effect. Analysis of the properties shows that the formation of chalcogen bond mainly promotes the charge transfer of LP(O) &#8208; BD*(C&#8208;Se) in the carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation (key step), so that the charge of C(4) atom become more positive, thereby accelerating the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;pot Synthesis of Phosphorus&#8208;modified ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite by Solid&#8208;state Method and its MTO Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green and efficient strategy for synthesizing phosphorus modified ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite is proposed by grinding phosphorus source, silicon source and aluminum source with the solvent&#8208;free conditions. Phosphorus&#8208;modified ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites exhibited higher light olefin selectivity and longer catalytic lifetime (33&#8197;h) in methanol to olefin reaction when the weight hourly space velocity was 4&#8197;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
The traditional hydrothermal synthesis strategy of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite is energy&#8208;consumption accompanying by pollution issues. Herein, phosphorus&#8208;modified layered ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites (PZ) were obtained by one&#8208;pot synthesis under solvent&#8208;free conditions. The synthesized samples were fully characterized by XRD, SEM, BET, NH3&#8208;TPD and FTIR. The effect of phosphorus addition on the morphology and catalytic activity of ZSM&#8208;5 was investigated. The results showed that phosphorus&#8208;modified ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites exhibited higher light olefin (ethylene and propylene) selectivity (above 50&#8201;%) and longer catalytic lifetime (33&#8197;h) in methanol to olefin (MTO) reaction when the weight hourly space velocity was 4&#8197;h&#8722;1. Phosphorus&#8208;modified ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite synthesized by in&#8197;situ solvent&#8208;free method, which not only reduced the discharge of sewage but also showed a simple method to realize the introduction of phosphorous species, which provided a new idea for phosphorus modification of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite.

         <title>Enhanced Solvent and Thermal Stability in Cross&#8208;Linkable Conjugated Statistical Copolymers for Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT statistical copolymers containing hydroxyl groups attached to the P3HHT components was synthesized by KCTP polymerization. They occur cross&#8208;linked and retain edge&#8208;on manner at 150&#8201;&#176;C, while losing the ordered packing at 300&#8201;&#176;C. The cross&#8208;linked P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT exhibit good solvent resistance property and improved thermal stability in organic field&#8208;effect transistors.







Abstract
The ability to enhance both the solvent and thermal stability of semiconducting &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers is highly desired for various device&#8208;related applications. Herein, a series of poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene)&#8208;stat&#8208;poly[3&#8208;(6&#8208;hydroxy)hexylthiophene] (P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT) statistical copolymers with thermally cross&#8208;linkable hydroxyl groups is synthesized and their crystalline structures in three different states, solvent and thermal stability for use in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) are elucidated. Importantly, these initial P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT thin films in their as&#8208;cast state crystallize well in an edge&#8208;on orientation. During annealing at 150&#8201;&#176;C, these P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT occur cross&#8208;linked and retain edge&#8208;on orientation with increased crystallinity and ordering. In contrast, after high&#8208;temperature annealing at 300&#8201;&#176;C, their edge&#8208;on orientation is significantly destroyed due to the cross&#8208;linking of hydroxyl groups at melted state. The correlation between different P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT and their charge mobilities is scrutinized. These cross&#8208;linked P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT exhibit good solvent resistance property and improved thermal stability in OFETs. Conceptually, such side&#8208;chain functionalization approach to improve the stability of P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT can be conveniently extended to other conjugated polymers for diverse optoelectronic applications.

A four&#8208;step approach to a presilphiperfolanol: Allylation of (&#8722;)&#8208;pulegone followed by an alkylation renders a trisubstituted cyclohexanone, which leads to a bridged bicyclo[4.3.1]undecen&#8208;one by a ring&#8208;closing metathesis. The embedded alkene&#8208;ketone functionalization is key for the metal&#8208;hydride atom transfer (MHAT) intramolecular &#8220;alkene first&#8221; radical process leading to the epimer at C&#8208;4 of presilphiperfolan&#8208;8&#945;&#8208;ol.







Abstract
From an (R)&#8208;(+)&#8208;pulegone&#8208;derived building block that incorporates the stereo&#8208;defined tertiary carbon bearing a methyl group, as found in the targeted sesquiterpenoid, a four&#8208;step synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;4&#8208;epi&#8208;presilphiperfolan&#8208;8&#8208;&#945;&#8208;ol was achieved.

This synthetic method, implying an irreversible addition of a carbon&#8208;centered radical upon a ketone by means of a hydrogen atom transfer upon the alkoxy radical intermediate, was also applied in the synthesis of trans&#8208;fused hydrindanols structurally related to botrydial compounds.

         <title>Biomineralized Piezoelectrically Active Scaffolds for Inducing Osteogenic Differentiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bone tissue engineering scaffold was developed. The scaffold was realized by coupling porous poly (vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) coating and calcium phosphate (CaP) coating. Piezoelectric effects can be produced by low&#8208;intensity ultrasound, the self&#8208;motion of the animal body. Through the coupling of piezoelectric effect and physicochemical properties, the scaffold has good osteoinductive ability.







Abstract
There is an endogenous electric field in living organisms, which plays a vital role in the development and regeneration of bone tissue. Therefore, self&#8208;powered piezoelectric material for bone repair has become hot research in recent years. However, the current piezoelectric materials for tissue regeneration still have the shortcomings of lack of biological activity and three&#8208;dimensional structure. Here, we proposed a three&#8208;dimensional polyurethane foam (PUF) scaffold coated with piezoelectric poly (vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) and modified by a calcium phosphate (CaP) mineralized coating. The preferred scaffold has an open circuit voltage and short circuit current output of 5&#8197;V and 200&#8197;nA. Combining the physical and chemical properties of the CaP coating, the piezoelectric signal of PVDF&#8208;HFP and the three&#8208;dimensional structure of PUF, the scaffold exhibits superior promotion of cell osteogenic differentiation and ectopic bone formation in&#8197;vivo. The mechanism is attributed to an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels in response to chemical and piezoelectric stimulation with the material. This research not only paves the way for the application of piezoelectric scaffolds to stimulate osteoblasts differentiation in&#8197;situ, but also lays the foundation for the clinical treatment of long&#8208;term osteoporosis.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A bone tissue engineering scaffold&lt;/b&gt; was developed. The scaffold was realized by coupling porous poly (vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) coating and calcium phosphate (CaP) coating. Piezoelectric effects can be produced by low-intensity ultrasound, the self-motion of the animal body. Through the coupling of piezoelectric effect and physicochemical properties, the scaffold has good osteoinductive ability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an endogenous electric field in living organisms, which plays a vital role in the development and regeneration of bone tissue. Therefore, self-powered piezoelectric material for bone repair has become hot research in recent years. However, the current piezoelectric materials for tissue regeneration still have the shortcomings of lack of biological activity and three-dimensional structure. Here, we proposed a three-dimensional polyurethane foam (PUF) scaffold coated with piezoelectric poly (vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) and modified by a calcium phosphate (CaP) mineralized coating.

         <title>Exploiting Coordination Behavior of 7&#8208;Azaindole for Mechanistic Investigation of Chan&#8208;Lam Coupling and Application to 7&#8208;Azaindole Based Pharmacophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a new copper(II)&#8208;DBU catalytic system, Chan&#8208;Lam type N&#8208;arylation of 7&#8208;azaindole is discussed. A new mechanism confirming the involvement of Cu(II)/Cu(III)/Cu(I) species for the cross&#8208;coupling pathway is proposed by identifying and characterizing key reaction intermediates through detailed spectroscopic, crystallographic investigations, DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations. A 7&#8208;azaindole&#8208;based SHP2 inhibitor, important in the medical field, is synthesized via sequential arylation.







Abstract
Multiple spectroscopic techniques, along with single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis, have been used to reveal the detailed structural and electronic information on reaction intermediates of a new copper(II)&#8208;DBU catalytic system for the N&#8208;arylation of 7&#8208;Azaindole. The reaction mixture of Chan&#8208;Lam cross&#8208;coupling yields two dimeric copper(II)&#8208;7&#8208;azaindole complexes, including one attached with DBU, prior to adding arylboronic acid and are confirmed structurally and spectroscopically. A suitable mechanism has been proposed using the dimeric copper(II) complex as a catalyst for the coupling reactions. The role of DBU as a base and also as an auxiliary ligand in the course of the reaction has been established. The transmetalated monomeric aryl&#8208;copper(II) species generated from the dimeric unit is oxidized by another equivalent of copper(II) to yield an aryl&#8208;copper(III) intermediate for facile N&#8208;arylation, which has been authenticated with UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy. The regeneration of the copper(II)&#8208;catalyst by aerial oxidation of colorless copper(I) species (generated via reductive elimination and disproportionation step) is confirmed by mass and absorption spectroscopy. Detailed DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations help to rationalize the proposed reaction intermediates and their corresponding electronic transitions. Moreover, the confirmation of copper(I)&#8208;7&#8208;azaindole intermediate via HRMS reaffirmed the involvement of Cu(II)/Cu(III)/Cu(I) species in the Chan&#8208;Lam type of coupling. A medicinally&#8208;important 7&#8208;azaindole&#8208;based SHP2 inhibitor has been synthesized via sequential arylation.

         <title>Coordination and Stabilization of a Lithium Ion with a Silylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stabilization effect: We have synthesized and characterized a silylene stabilized lithium ion 1. Compound 1 exhibits presence of two four&#8208; membered and one six&#8208; membered ring as confirmed by QTAIM calculations. Compound 2 shows unusual dissociation of carbodiimide to give two four&#8208;membered rings containing a penta&#8208;coordinated silicon as a central atom. Furthermore, the bond nature and stabilization of compound 1 were confirmed by quantum theory of atoms in molecules.







Abstract
Herein, we report the stabilization of lithium&#8208;ion as the source of lithium to use as a trans&#8208;metalation reagent [{PhC(NtBu)2Si(tBu)Li}2I(tBuN)2CPh] (1). The reaction of 3 equivalents of the LSitBu (L=PhC(NtBu)2) and lithium iodide at low temperature leads to a silylene stabilized lithium&#8208;ion with an additional coordination of amidinate ligand. Compound 1 shows two four membered and one six membered ring as confirmed by QTAIM calculations. Whereas the reaction of the LSiCl with 1.5 equivalents of carbodiimide (CyN)2C at room temperature affords compound [PhC(NtBu)2Si(Cl)(NCy)2NCy] (2) with the CN2SiN2C skeleton containing silicon as a central atom. Both the compounds were fully characterized by NMR, mass spectrometry, X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, and quantum mechanical calculations.

Toward D&#8208;A&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules: Fluorinated pentalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione (FPD), a strong electron&#8208;accepting unit was designed, and a derivative that contains a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8722;A&#8722;D) conjugated molecule for use in organic semiconducting materials is reported. The compound was characterized based on its electrochemical properties, photophysical properties, and X&#8208;ray analyses to elucidate the structure&#8211;property relationships of the compounds.







Abstract
The development of electron&#8208;accepting units is of significant importance because the construction of donor (D)&#8208;acceptor (A) configurations is an effective strategy for tuning the electronic properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. Although doubly fused pentagons represented by diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) have been used as an effective electron&#8208;accepting unit, the relatively high&#8208;lying frontier molecular orbital levels (FMOs) leave room for further improvement. We report herein the synthesis of a fluorinated dihydropentalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione (FPD) derivative as a strong electron&#8208;accepting unit and the development of D&#8722;A&#8722;D &#960;&#8208;extended molecules. X&#8208;ray analyses revealed that the presence of fluorine atoms contributed to the formation of high planar structures and slipped&#8208;stacked packing. Electrochemical measurements indicated that the FPD derivatives showed relatively lower FMO energy levels than the corresponding DPP&#8208;containing derivatives. The D&#8722;A&#8722;D molecule based on terthiophene and FPD showed semiconducting responses. This study demonstrates that the FPD unit can function as a new acceptor unit for organic semiconductors.

         <title>Enantioselective Desymmetrization Triggered by Iminium&#8208;Enamine Activation: Access to Complex Cyclohepta[b]indoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organocatalysis: Asymmetric desymmetrization of prochiral enal&#8208;tethered cyclohexadienones has been developed by using organocatalytic iminium&#8208;enamine activation. The reaction provides an access to bicyclic enones with excellent enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity, which further undergo acid&#8208;mediated intramolecular annulation to afford highly strained and complex cyclohepta[b]indoles with five contiguous stereocentres.







Abstract
The expeditious construction of complex molecules having multiple stereocentres is highly desirable in organic chemistry. In the present communication, we report the development of an organocatalytic asymmetric desymmetrization of prochiral enal&#8208;tethered cyclohexadienones via the C3&#8208;selective Friedel&#8722;Crafts alkylation of indoles triggered by LUMO&#8208;lowering iminium activation/HOMO&#8208;raising enamine activation. The reaction provides access to bicyclic enones, which further undergo acid&#8208;mediated intramolecular annulation from C2&#8208;position to afford highly strained cyclohepta[b]indoles with five contiguous stereocentres and three new C&#8722;C bonds in excellent enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Higher&#8208;Order Cycloaddition Reactions for the Construction of Polycyclic Aromatic and Polycyclic Heteroaromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new pathway to access polycyclic (hetero&#8208;)aromatic compounds from simple starting materials has been investigated. The starting materials are funneled in an organocatalyzed higher&#8208;order cycloaddition that generates three&#8208;dimensional polycyclic (hetero&#8208;)aromatic compounds. The compounds are then easily flattened to their two&#8208;dimensional analogues by oxidation. More information can be found in the Concept by K.&#8197;A. J&#248;rgensen and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202204008).

         <title>3,11&#8208;Diaminodibenzo[a,j]phenazine: Synthesis, Properties, and Applications to Tr&#246;ger's Base&#8208;Forming Ladder Polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new aminophenazine functional molecule: It displays efficient photoluminescence and positive luminochromism in organic solvent. Not only useful it is as luminophore, but also does it serve as a building block for Tr&#246;ger's base regioregular ladder polymer. The ladder polymer nicely shows reversible adsorption/desorption behavior of carbon dioxide molecule.







Abstract
A new class of diamino&#8208;substituted &#960;&#8208;extended phenazine compound was synthesized, and its photophysical properties were investigated. The U&#8208;shaped diaminophenazine displayed photoluminescence in solution with moderate quantum yield. The diamino aromatic compound was found applicable to the poly&#8208;condensation with formaldehyde to form Tr&#246;ger's base ladder polymer. The obtained microporous ladder polymer features high CO2 adsorption selectivity against N2, most likely due to the presence of basic nitrogen atoms in the phenazine rings.

         <title>Diverse Cooperative Reactivity at a Square Planar Aluminium Complex and Catalytic Reduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural constraint imparted by a sterically demanding pincer ligand results in an unusual tetracoordinate aluminium Lewis acid that undergoes multiple modes of metal&#8208;ligand cooperative reactivity with ketones and CO2. Adding HBpin allows for the catalytic hydroboration of carbonyl&#8208;containing substrates and the reduction of CO2 to a methanol equivalent.







Abstract
The use of a sterically demanding pincer ligand to prepare an unusual square planar aluminium complex is reported. Due to the constrained geometry imposed by the ligand scaffold, this four&#8208;coordinate aluminium centre remains Lewis acidic and reacts via differing metal&#8208;ligand cooperative pathways for activating ketones and CO2. It is also a rare example of a single&#8208;component aluminium system for the catalytic reduction of CO2 to a methanol equivalent at room temperature.

         <title>Quinoid Conjugated Polymer Nanoparticles with NIR&#8208;II Absorption Peak Toward Efficient Photothermal Therapy
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quinoid conjugated polymer PIS with broad absorption in the NIR&#8208;II region is developed based on multiple strategies. Benefiting from its remarkable photothermal conversion behavior under NIR&#8208;II laser (1064&#8197;nm), PIS nanoparticles show excellent antitumor performances in both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo studies. This work presents a rational design strategy to explore NIR&#8208;II photothermal agents for hyperthermia therapy.







Abstract
Recently, extensive efforts have been devoted to the development of the second near&#8208;infrared bio&#8208;window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) theranostic agents owing to the excellent tissue&#8208;penetration capability of NIR&#8208;II light. The exploration of organic NIR&#8208;II photothermal therapy materials, especially those with absorption peak over 1000&#8197;nm, is an appealing yet significantly challenging task. Herein, we have designed conjugated polymer nanoparticles (PIS NPs) with NIR&#8208;II absorption peak at 1026&#8197;nm through a combined strategy of introducing quinoid donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A) structures, constructing intramolecular &#8220;conformational locks&#8221; and extending the conjugation area to narrow the band gap. Irradiated at 1064&#8197;nm, PIS NPs showed remarkable photothermal conversion performance for efficient photothermal ablation of tumor cells in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. This study provides useful insights into the rational design of organic NIR&#8208;II photothermal agents based on multiple strategies.

         <title>Plenates: Anion&#8208;Dependent Self&#8208;Assembly of the Pyrrole Cage Encapsulating Silver(I) Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of 2,5&#8208;diformylpyrrole, tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine, and silver(I) yielded a series of new cascade complexes or plenates, that is, cryptates incorporating Agnn+ clusters. The tripyrrolic cage is represented by a wooden chest hiding the treasure, which in the case of plenates, contains a pile of shiny silver atoms. In contrast, for cascade complexes, two precious metals lie next to anions shown as colorful gems. Obviously, such treasure cannot remain unprotected&#8230; More information can be found in the Research Article by B. Szyszko and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203850).

   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; clusters. The tripyrrolic cage is represented by a wooden chest hiding the treasure, which in the case of plenates, contains a pile of shiny silver atoms. In contrast, for cascade complexes, two precious metals lie next to anions shown as colorful gems. Obviously, such treasure cannot remain unprotected&#8230; More information can be found in the Research Article by B.

         <title>Live Monitoring of Anionic Living Polymerizations by Electrospray&#8208;Ionization Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry easily distinguishes the different living oligomers resulting from the anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization of the acceptor&#8208;substituted cyclopropane Mcyclic. Kinetic modeling reproduces the measured time evolution of the growing oligomers and affords the rate constants of the individual propagation steps.

         <title>Tailoring Galactose Oxidase for Self&#8208;powered Benzyl Alcohol Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Benzyl alcohol (BnOH) is a widely&#8208;used preservative in a variety of cosmetics, but the excess addition (&#8805;1.0%) may cause strong symptoms such as nausea, gastrointestinal irritation, convulsion, even death, making it crucial to monitor and control the addition quantity. Herein, we have developed a test&#8208;strip&#8208;like BnOH detection method via tailoring a galactose oxidase (GOase) towards BnOH oxidation and preparing a self&#8208;powered electrochromic strip for BnOH concentration visualization. A double&#8208;substituted GOase variant (Y329S/R330F) on the basis of the reported GOase M1 has been obtained by semi&#8208;rational design with a 24.6&#8208;fold improved activity towards BnOH compared to GOase M1. The GOase Y329S/R330F electrode responses BnOH with a linear range of 0.04 to 3.25 mM (R2=0.9985), a sensitivity of 122.78 &#181;A mM&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, and a detection limit of 0.03 mM (S/N=3). Coupling an electrochromic Prussian blue (PB) cathode helps the successful sensing visualization without any further power supply. The present sensing is more convenient and user&#8208;friendly than the generally used gas chromatography (GC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and brings a more accessible solution to the field of quality controlling.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Diradical&#8208;Mediated ipso&#8208;Cyclization towards Double Dearomative [2+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition or Smiles&#8208;Type Rearrangement</title>

         <dc:description>
Diradical&#8208;mediated ipso&#8208;cyclization involving dearomatizing spiro&#8208;intermediates of aromatic compounds towards divergent reaction pathways deserves investigation but has been rarely reported so far. By tuning the rate of C&#8722;S bond cleavage in the key dearomatizing spiro intermediate, a chemical divergent reaction of (hetero)aryl sulfonamides has been achieved in a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced energy transfer reaction pathway involving diradical species.







Abstract
When mono&#8208;radical ipso&#8208;cyclization of aryl sulfonamides tend to undergo Smiles&#8208;type rearrangement through aromatization&#8208;driven C&#8722;S bond cleavage, diradical&#8208;mediated cyclization must perform in a distinct reaction pathway. It is interesting meanwhile challenging to tune the rate of C&#8722;S bond cleavage to achieve a chemically divergent reaction of (hetero) aryl sulfonamides in a visible&#8208;light induced energy transfer (EnT) reaction pathway involving diradical species. Herein a chemically divergent reaction based on the designed indole&#8208;tethered (hetero)arylsulfonamides is reported which involves a diradical&#8208;mediated ipso&#8208;cyclization and a controllable cleavage of an inherent C&#8722;S bond. The combined experimental and computational results have revealed that the cleavage of the C&#8722;S bond in these substrates can be controlled by tuning the heteroaryl moieties: a) If the (hetero)aryl is thienyl, furyl, phenanthryl, etc., the radical coupling of double dearomative diradicals (DDDR) precedes over C&#8722;S bond cleavage to afford cyclobutene fused indolines by double dearomative [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition; b) if the (hetero)aryl is phenyl, naphthyl, pyridyl, indolyl etc., the cleavage of C&#8722;S bond in DDDR is favored over radical coupling to afford biaryl products.

         <title>A Selective Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular&#8208;Proton&#8208;Transfer (ESIPT) Sensor for Copper(II) Based on Chelation&#8208;Enhanced Quenching and &#8220;Off&#8208;On&#8221; Detection of Amino Acids</title>

         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of 2&#8208;(4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenol (TPI&#8208;9) as an interesting fluorescent molecule displaying Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular&#8208;Proton&#8208;Transfer (ESIPT) with Stokes shift of 120 nm. Phenolic compounds with the ability to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds and subsequent proton transfer are known as ESIPT fluorophores. Proton accepting ability can increase significantly by tailoring electron&#8208;donating groups. With the assistance of an environment&#8208;friendly organocatalyst, 10&#8208;camphor sulfonic acid (10&#8208;CSA), TPI&#8208;9 was synthesized to introduce substituents with electron&#8208;donating abilities to develop an efficient ESIPT mechanism. Factors influencing the emission, such as solvent, pH, and metal ions, are investigated. Quenching of fluorescence by Cu2+ through chelation enhancement quenching effect with a high selectivity allowed the establishment of a Cu2+ sensor with an LoD of 0.57 ppm and a ratiometric estimation with an LoD of 0.73 ppm. Metal binding (2:1) stoichiometry and quenching constant (0.0072 mol&#8208;1s&#8208;1) are calculated from Job&#8217;s and Stern&#8208;Volmer plots. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are in accordance with the experimental results. Competitive replacement of TPI&#8208;9 by amino acids restores ESIPT, consequently, the fluorescence. Thus, an &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescence sensor for amino acid estimation is developed under 1&#8208;minute incubation. A linear relationship between amino acid concentration and fluorescence intensity is in 0&#8208;20 &#956;g/mL range, and the LoD is less than 2.2 &#956;g/mL</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based polymer electrolytes with good flexibility and viscoelasticity, low interfacial resistance, and fabricating cost have caught worldwide attention, but their practical application is still hampered by the instability at high voltages and the ionic conductivity (10&#8722;8 to 10&#8722;6 S cm&#8722;1). Herein, we rational designed defects&#8208;abundant Ga2O3&#160;nanobricks as multifunctional filler constructed a PEO&#8208;based organic&#8208;inorganic electrolyte for lithium metal batteries. Due to the abundant O&#8208;defects&#160;feature of Ga2O3&#160;filler, this PEO&#8208;based composite&#160;electrolyte not only broadens electrochemical stability window&#160;(over 5.3&#160;V versus Li/Li+)&#160;but also in&#8208;situ forms a Li&#8211;Ga alloy and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film during the cycling process causing a rapid diffusion of Li+&#160;ions. The as&#8208;prepared electrolyte achieves the effect of stabilizing interfacial with Li metal (without short&#8208;circuiting over 500 h at 0.2 mA cm&#8722;2) and possesses superior high ionic conductivity. The assembled all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LiFePO4//Li cells attained a superior cycling performance of 146 mAh g&#8722;1 over 100 cycles at 0.5 C.&#160;The XPS analysis reveals that Ga2O3&#160;nanobricks can form a Li&#8208;Ga alloy layer in situ at the polymer/anode interface.&#160;This work shed a light on designing high ionic conductivity lithium alloys in the composite electrolyte to improve the electrochemical properties of PEO&#8208;based polymer electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Exploration of ESIPT in a Systematically Constructed Series of Benzimidazole Based Schiff Base Probes: Application as Chemosensors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we have utilized 2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)benzimidazole (HBI) to synthesize 3&#8208;(1H&#8208;benzoimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;5&#8208;methyl&#8208;benzaldehyde (HBIA) followed by three Schiff bases by using &#8208;ortho (H2BIo), &#8208;meta (H3BIdm) and &#8208;para (H2BIp) substituted amino benzoic acids and studied their photophysical properties. We have successfully derived molecular structures of HBI, HBIA and H3BIdm which reveals that in HBI and HBIA, the phenolic &#8208;OH is intramolecularly hydrogen bonded with sp2N of benzimidazole group whereas in H3BIdm, it is hydrogen bonded with imine C=N of Schiff base moiety, which is responsible for different solid state emission properties of the reported compounds. Extensive experimental and theoretical studies show that for all three Schiff bases, in solution due to activation of C=N isomerization, ESIPT operates through benzimidazole site and displays different emission from the solid state. Furthermore, H2BIo, H3BIdm and H2BIp selectively sense Cu2+ in semi aqueous medium with nano&#8208;molar detection limit and in HuH&#8208;7 cells through the inhibition of ESIPT of process.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Design of an Uncharged Ambipolar Helical Scaffold to Achieve Efficient Solid&#8208;State Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work demonstrates highly efficient solid&#8208;state proton conduction in helical organic scaffolds inspired by the biomolecule Gramicidin A. The scaffold 1 derived from pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxamide (PDC) residue adopts a helical conformation that is stabilized by a network of strong bifurcated intramolecular H&#8208;bonds between the polar residues that align the inner (concave) face of the molecule, while the aromatic units present in 1 are oriented outwardly. As a result, the helix attains an ambipolar nature just like Gramicidin A. Two different solid forms of 1 could be isolated: a yellow solid from high&#8208;polarity solvents and an orange solid from low&#8208;polarity solvents. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) studies showed that in the former, molecules of 1 are stacked in a homochiral fashion while in the latter heterochiral stacks of 1 were present. The yellow form exhibited almost &#8764;300&#8208;fold higher conductivity (of up to 0.12 mS/cm at 95 &#176;C and 95% relative humidity) than the orange form as a result of closer intermolecular proximity and lower activation energy of 0.098 eV indicating Grotthus mechanism of proton transport. This study establishes the key role of bioinspired design and controlled stereo&#8208;organization of such discrete uncharged organic molecules for achieving efficient solid state proton conduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and densification of Mo/Mg co&#8208;doped apatite&#8208;type lanthanum silicate electrolyte&#160;with enhanced ionic conductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Apatite&#8208;type lanthanum silicate (LSO) electrolyte is one of the most promising candidates for developing intermediate&#8208;temperature&#160;solid oxide electrolysis cells&#160;and solid oxide full cells (IT&#8208;SOECs and SOFCs) due to its stability and low&#160;activation energy. However, the LSO electrolyte still suffers from unsatisfied ionic conductivity and low relative density. Here in this work, a novel co&#8208;doping method is reported to prepare highly purified nanocrystalline powder of Mg&#8208;Mo co&#8208;doped LSO (Mg/Mo&#8208;LSO) electrolytes with high excellent densification properties and improved ionic conductivity. Introducing the Mo6+&#160;and Mg2+&#160;ions into the LSO structure can increase the number of interstitial oxide ions and improve the degree of densification at lower sintering temperatures, more importantly, expand the migration channel of oxide ions to enhance the ionic conductivity. As a result, the relative density of the fabricated Mo/Mg&#8208;LSO electrolytes pellets could achieve more than 98% of the theoretical density after sintering at 1500 &#8451; for 4 h with a grain size of about 1&#8208;3 &#956;m and the EIS results showed the ionic conductivity increased from 0.782 mS&#183;cm&#8208;1&#160;for the pristine LSO to 33.94 mS&#183;cm&#8208;1&#160;for the doped sample La9.5Si5.45Mg0.3Mo0.25O26+&#948;&#160;at 800 &#8451;. In addition, the effect of different Mo6+&#160;doping contents was investigated systematically. The proposed Mo/Mg co&#8208;doping method&#160;is one step forward in developing apatite&#8208;structured electrolytes&#160;addressing the common issues associated with the fabrication of dense, highly conductive, and thermochemically stable solid electrolytes.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Apatite-type lanthanum silicate (LSO) electrolyte is one of the most promising candidates for developing intermediate-temperature&#160;solid oxide electrolysis cells&#160;and solid oxide full cells (IT-SOECs and SOFCs) due to its stability and low&#160;activation energy. However, the LSO electrolyte still suffers from unsatisfied ionic conductivity and low relative density. Here in this work, a novel co-doping method is reported to prepare highly purified nanocrystalline powder of Mg-Mo co-doped LSO (Mg/Mo-LSO) electrolytes with high excellent densification properties and improved ionic conductivity. Introducing the Mo6+&#160;and Mg2+&#160;ions into the LSO structure can increase the number of interstitial oxide ions and improve the degree of densification at lower sintering temperatures, more importantly, expand the migration channel of oxide ions to enhance the ionic conductivity. As a result, the relative density of the fabricated Mo/Mg-LSO electrolytes pellets could achieve more than 98% of the theoretical density after sintering at 1500 &#8451; for 4 h with a grain size of about 1-3 &#956;m and the EIS results showed the ionic conductivity increased from 0.782 mS&#183;cm-1&#160;for the pristine LSO to 33.94 mS&#183;cm-1&#160;for the doped sample La9.5Si5.45Mg0.3Mo0.25O26+&#948;&#160;at 800 &#8451;. In addition, the effect of different Mo6+&#160;doping contents was investigated systematically.

         <title>Liquid Dynamics Determine Transition Metal&#8208;N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complex Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Getting beyond first base: To choose the best base in NHC complex syntheses, considerations beyond pKa values are necessary. The high activity of ionic bases can be explained through their affinity to form ion pairs with the substrate imidazolium cation, allowing for a more frequent interaction with the acidic site of the ring.







Abstract
The mechanism of metal&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complex formation from imidazolium salts in the presence of weak bases was investigated through theoretical methods. Quantum chemical calculations revealed that the two bases considered here, sodium acetate and trimethylamine, both facilitate complex formation. In contrast to previous experiments, these calculations indicated a slightly lower barrier with the amine. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the ionic nature of the [AuCl2]&#8722; and imidazolium ions, as well as the sodium acetate base keep these species associated in the reaction mixture through ion pairing. This pre&#8208;association of the components produces those clusters that are essential for the metal complex formation reaction. The neutral amine, however, remains mostly separated from the other reaction partners, making it a significantly less effective base.

         <title>Specific Signal Enhancement on an RNA&#8208;Protein Interface by Dynamic Nuclear Polarization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A guide to better spectra: Dynamic nuclear polarization, sparse isotope labeling, and methyl dynamics have been combined to yield site&#8208;specific enhancement of NMR spectroscopic signals from the protein&#8208;RNA binding site within a ribonucleoprotein. For L7Ae protein in complex with guide RNA from box C/D complex, a single methyl&#8208;nucleotide contact can be spectroscopically isolated.







Abstract
Sensitivity and specificity are both crucial for the efficient solid&#8208;state NMR structure determination of large biomolecules. We present an approach that features both advantages by site&#8208;specific enhancement of NMR spectroscopic signals from the protein&#8208;RNA binding site within a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) by dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). This approach uses modern biochemical techniques for sparse isotope labeling and exploits the molecular dynamics of 13C&#8208;labeled methyl groups exclusively present in the protein. These dynamics drive heteronuclear cross relaxation and thus allow specific hyperpolarization transfer across the biomolecular complex's interface. For the example of the L7Ae protein in complex with a 26mer guide RNA minimal construct from the box C/D complex in archaea, we demonstrate that a single methyl&#8208;nucleotide contact is responsible for most of the polarization transfer to the RNA, and that this specific transfer can be used to boost both NMR spectral sensitivity and specificity by DNP.

         <title>Tetrelanes versus Tetrylenes as Precursors to Transition Metal Complexes Featuring Tridentate PEP Tetryl Ligands (E=Si, Ge, Sn)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PEP ligands: Two general synthetic approaches to the synthesis of tridentate PEP tetryl (E=Si, Ge, Sn) metal complexes are presented as a function of the metal&#8208;free precursor, tetrelane or tetrylene, that gives rise to the final PEP tetryl ligand. For each approach, all the currently known types of PEP tetryl ligand frameworks that have been found in their corresponding complexes are presented and discussed.







Abstract
Two synthetic approaches have until now been used to synthesize transition metal complexes having a tridentate (pincer or tripod) PEP tetryl (E=Si, Ge, Sn) ligand. These approaches differ in the metal&#8208;free precursor, tetrelane or tetrylene, that gives rise to the corresponding PEP tetryl ligand. Tetrelanes (PSiP silanes, PGeP germanes and PSnP stannanes and simple phosphane&#8208;free stannanes) have led to tetryl ligands by oxidatively adding an E&#8722;X bond (X=H, C or halogen in most cases) to the metal atom of a low&#8208;valent transition metal complex, whereas tetrylenes (PGeP germylenes and PSnP stannylenes) have led to tetryl ligands upon insertion of their E atom into an M&#8722;X bond (X=Cl in most cases) of the metal precursor or through a derivatization of the E atom after the tetrylene fragment is coordinated to the metal. For each synthetic approach, all the currently known types of PEP tetryl ligand frameworks that have been found in transition metal complexes are presented and discussed in this review.

Tetrelanes (PSiP silanes, PGeP germanes and PSnP stannanes and simple phosphane-free stannanes) have led to tetryl ligands by oxidatively adding an E&#8722;X bond (X=H, C or halogen in most cases) to the metal atom of a low-valent transition metal complex, whereas tetrylenes (PGeP germylenes and PSnP stannylenes) have led to tetryl ligands upon insertion of their E atom into an M&#8722;X bond (X=Cl in most cases) of the metal precursor or through a derivatization of the E atom after the tetrylene fragment is coordinated to the metal. For each synthetic approach, all the currently known types of PEP tetryl ligand frameworks that have been found in transition metal complexes are presented and discussed in this review.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chalcogen&#8208;Bond Catalysis: Telluronium&#8208;Catalyzed [4+2]&#8208;Cyclocondensation of (in situ Generated) Aryl Imines with Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Telluronium salts bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups were prepared, and their ability to drive chalcogen bonds with ketones and imines was demonstrated in the solid state and in solution. These strong &#963;&#8208;hole bond donors were able to efficiently catalyze the Povarov reaction through chalcogen bond activation of imines and subsequent reaction with alkenes. The title reaction was found to be as efficient with pre&#8208;formed or in situ generated imines.







Abstract
In the chalcogen series, tellurium species exhibit the strongest chalcogen bonding (ChB) interaction with electron&#8208;rich atom. This property explains the renewed interested toward tellurium&#8208;based derivatives and their use in different applications, such as organocatalysis. In this context, the catalytic activity of telluronium salts in the Povarov reaction is presented herein. Different dienophiles, as well as imines of variable electronic nature, efficiently react in the presence of catalytic amount of either diarylmethyltelluronium or triaryltelluronium salts. Both catalysts could also readily perform the three&#8208;component Povarov reaction starting from aldehyde, aniline and dihydrofuran. The reactivity of telluroniums towards imines and aldehydes was confirmed in the solid state by the ability of Te atom to interact through ChB with the oxygen carbonyl of acetone, and in solution with significant shift variations of the imine proton and of the tellurium atom in 1H and 125Te NMR spectroscopy. For the most active telluronium catalysts bearing CF3 groups, association constants (K) with N&#8208;phenyl phenylmethanimine in the range 22&#8211;38&#8197;M&#8722;1 were measured in dichloromethane.

         <title>Activity Sensing of Coagulation and Fibrinolytic Proteases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the essential proteases involved in blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, the endogenous peptide sequences they recognize and hydrolyze, and synthetic activity&#8208;based peptide probes based on these sequences to measure their activity. The existing strategies summarized in this review could contribute to the challenges ahead in the field of coagulation and fibrinolytic monitoring, especially for point&#8208;of&#8208;care applications.







Abstract
The blood coagulation cascade is a complex physiological process involving the action of multiple coupled enzymes, cofactors, and substrates, ultimately leading to clot formation. Serine proteases have a crucial role, and aberrations in their activity can lead to life&#8208;threatening bleeding disorders and thrombosis. This review summarizes the essential proteases involved in blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, the endogenous peptide sequences they recognize and hydrolyze, and synthetic peptide probes based on these sequences to measure their activity. The information in this review can contribute to developing novel anticoagulant therapies and specific substrates for point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnosis of coagulation pathologies.

         <title>Substituent&#8208;Dependent Photoexcitation Processes of &#960;&#8208;Stacked Ion Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various combinations of porphyrin ions with controlled electronic states were achieved by ion&#8208;pair metathesis based on the hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB) theory. The transient absorption spectra of the porphyrin ion pairs revealed photoinduced electron transfer from the anion to the cation through substituent&#8208;dependent photoexcitation processes.







Abstract
Porphyrin ion pairs, the charge of which is delocalized in core units, form tightly associated structures through i&#960;&#8211;i&#960; interactions. 5,10,15&#8208;Triphenyl&#8208;substituted porphyrin&#8211;AuIII complex, which is favorable for forming stacked structures in the form of a stable ion, has been synthesized. Ion&#8208;pair metathesis based on the hard and soft acids and bases theory enabled combination with porphyrin anions possessing electronic states controlled by electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. Transient absorption spectroscopy suggested that the lifetimes of the radical pairs generated by photoinduced electron transfer of the ion pairs could be controlled by a judicious combination of the anions and cations.

Tin shines better with gold or silver: A luminescent pincer&#8208;type bis&#8208;stannylene ligand for exclusive tetrahedral coordination of the coinage metals was designed, and photoluminescence investigations as well as extensive quantum chemical calculations were carried out.







Abstract
The synthesis of a novel bis&#8208;stannylene pincer ligand and its complexation with coinage metals (CuI, AgI and AuI) are described. All coinage metal centres are in tetrahedral coordination environments in the solid state and are exclusively coordinated by four neutral SnII donors. 119Sn NMR provided information about the behaviour in solution. All of the isolated compounds have photoluminescent properties, and these were investigated at low and elevated temperatures. Compared to the free bis&#8208;stannylene ligand, coordination to coinage metals led to an increase in the luminescence intensity. The new compounds were investigated in detail through all&#8208;electron relativistic density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>A Conformal Carbon Nanolayer Coated Fe2O3 Cocatalyst for the Promoted Activity of Plasma&#8208;Sputtered BiVO4 Photoanode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Team work: Simultaneous improvement of activity and stability on BiVO4 photoanode was achieved by the simple H2 plasma treatment and a C&#8722;Fe2O3 oxygen evolution catalyst loading.







Abstract
To simultaneously improve the hole extraction ability of the BiVO4 photoanode and accelerate the surface reaction kinetics, herein, a carbon nanolayer conformally coated Fe2O3 (C&#8722;Fe2O3) as oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) is loaded on the H2 plasma treated nanoporous BiVO4 (BVO(H2)) surface by a hydrothermal reaction. It is found that the H2 plasma induced vacancies in BVO remarkably increases the conductivity, and the C&#8722;Fe2O3 enables hole extraction from the bulk to the surface as well as efficient hole injection to the electrolyte. As a result, the C&#8722;Fe2O3/BVO(H2) photoanode achieves a photocurrent density of 4.4&#8197;mA/cm2 at 1.23&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and an ABPE value of 1.5&#8201;% at 0.68&#8197;V vs. RHE, which are 4.8&#8208;fold and 13&#8208;fold higher than that of BVO photoanode, respectively.

         <title>Photocatalytic Synthesis of Acetals and Ketals from Aldehydes and Silylenolethers without the Use of Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoredox catalytic cycle with an electron&#8208;deficient perylene bisimide (PBI) runs as long as green light is provided. The substrate silylenolethers and aldehydes enter the cycle, are oxidized to their radical cations and converted to acetals and ketals, which leave the cycle as products. Acid catalysts are not needed. Ketal and acetal groups protect the carbonyl compounds like helmets. More information can be found in the Research Article by H.&#8208;A. Wagenknecht and D. Steuernagel (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203767).

         <title>Cyclic or linear? Parameters determining the outcome of glycine polymerization in silica surface prebiotic scenarios</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The parameters that determine the formation of linear peptides and cyclic dimers (diketopiperazine, DKP) on silica surfaces of different surface area, silanol and siloxane ring populations, controlled by thermal treatments, are investigated upon glycine deposition from gas and liquid phases. The formed products were characterized by infrared and Raman spectroscopies, X&#8208;ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis. The results reveal the importance of &#8220;nearly&#8208;free&#8221; silanols to form ester centers as primers for the formation of linear peptides over DKP, on surfaces with medium silanol density (1.4 to 2.7 nm&#8208;2). Quenched reactivity is seen on isolated silanols (density &#8804; 0.7 nm&#8208;2), while silanols involved in hydrogen bonding (density of 4.5 nm&#8208;2) weakly interact with Gly resulting in its cyclization to DKP. Deposition of glycine from liquid phase may also form both DKP and linear polymers, depending on its loading and silica surface. These conclusions demonstrate the complexity of glycine surface chemistry in the polymerization reaction and highlight the interest of a surface science approach to evaluate geochemical prebiotic scenarios.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Aurone&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;State Emissive (DSE) Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of dual&#8208;state emissive (DSE) fluorophores, i.e. organic molecules showing balanced emission in both solution and as molecular solids, has recently become an emerging approach in material science, biology, sensing, and optoelectronics. However, the majority of existing DSE fluorophores represents structural modifications of the scaffolds known for their aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties, e.g. tetraphenylethylenes (TFE), triphenylamines (TFA), and others. In this study, we introduce aurones as an easily accessible scaffold for the construction of DSE fluorophores and describe the main design principles allowing to achieve the balanced emission in both solution and solid state. Herein, we present the solid&#8208;state fluorescence in a systematic series of aurone derivatives for the first time. We propose that the newly found DSE properties of aurones in combination with their established biological activity can be applied efficiently in biomedical studies and diagnostic tools.</dc:description>

         <title>Orbital Nature of Carboionic Monoradicals Made from Diradicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electronic, optical, and solid state properties of a series of monoradicals, anions and cations, obtained from starting neutral diradicals, have been studied. Diradicals based on s&#8208;indacene and indenoacenes, with benzothiophenes fused and in different orientations feature a varying degree of diradical character in the neutral state which is here related with the properties of the radical redox forms. The analysis of their optical features in the polymethine monoradicals has been carried out in the framework of the molecular orbital and valence bond theories. Electronic UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR absorption, x&#8208;ray solid state diffraction and quantum chemical calculations have been carried out. Studies of the different positive/negative charged species, both residing in the same skeletal p&#8208;conjugated backbone, are rare for organic molecules. The key factor for the dual stabilization is the presence in the starting diradical character that enables to indistinctively accommodate a pseudo&#8208;hole and a pseudo&#8208;electron defect with certainly small reorganization energies for ambipolar charge transport.</dc:description>

         <title>Origin of Stereoselectivity in SE2&#8242; Reactions of Six&#8208;membered Ring Oxocarbenium Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bottoms up! Quantum chemical analyses of the transition states of SE2&#8242; reactions between substituted six&#8208;membered oxocarbenium ions and allyltrimethylsilane have provided quantitative insight into the stereoelectronic effects of the ring substituents, which dictate the stereoselectivity of the additions.







Abstract
Oxocarbenium ions are key reactive intermediates in organic chemistry. To generate a series of structure&#8208;reactivity&#8208;stereoselectivity principles for these species, we herein investigated the bimolecular electrophilic substitution reactions (SE2&#8242;) between allyltrimethylsilane and a series of archetypal six&#8208;membered ring oxocarbenium ions using a combined density functional theory (DFT) and coupled&#8208;cluster theory approach. These reactions preferentially proceed following a reaction path where the oxocarbenium ion transforms from a half chair (3H4 or 4H3) to a chair conformation. The introduction of alkoxy substituents on six&#8208;membered ring oxocarbenium ions, dramatically influences the conformational preference of the canonical 3H4 and 4H3 conformers, and thereby the stereochemical outcome of the SE2&#8242; reaction. In general, we find that the stereoselectivity in the reactions correlates to the &#8220;intrinsic preference&#8221; of the cations, as dictated by their shape. However, for the C5&#8208;CH2OMe substituent, steric factors override the &#8220;intrinsic preference&#8221;, showing a more selective reaction than expected based on the shape of the ion. Our SE2&#8242; energetics correlate well with experimentally observed stereoselectivity, and the use of the activation strain model has enabled us to quantify important interactions and structural features that occur in the transition state of the reactions to precisely understand the relative energy barriers of the diastereotopic addition reactions. The fundamental mechanistic insight provided in this study will aid in understanding the reactivity of more complex glycosyl cations featuring multiple substituents and will facilitate our general understanding of glycosylation reactions.

         <title>Engineering Sandwiched Nanochannel Aptasensor for Efficiently Screening Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aptamer sandwiched nanochannel electrochemical sensor was constructed for the highly selective determination of cancer cells. The structure design of nanochannel composite aptasensor not only presents an efficacious and reliable approach for cancer cell detection but also provides advantage for preventing electrode passivation in the process of biomarkers analysis.







Abstract
Cancer cells are a class of important tumor biomarkers and are closely related to tumorous progression. It is urgent to develop a sensitive and highly efficient method for the rapid and accurate detection of cancer cells. Herein, an aptamer sandwiched nanochannel electrochemical sensor was established for the highly selective determination of cancer cells. By virtue of the porous nanochannels as the filter platform and immobilized with DNA aptamers for specifically capturing the cancer cells, the nanochannel&#8208;based electrochemical sensor denotes excellent performance for MCF&#8208;7 screening, and allowing a low limit of detection of 36&#8197;cells&#8201;mL&#8722;1.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An aptamer sandwiched nanochannel&lt;/b&gt; electrochemical sensor was constructed for the highly selective determination of cancer cells. The structure design of nanochannel composite aptasensor not only presents an efficacious and reliable approach for cancer cell detection but also provides advantage for preventing electrode passivation in the process of biomarkers analysis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer cells are a class of important tumor biomarkers and are closely related to tumorous progression. It is urgent to develop a sensitive and highly efficient method for the rapid and accurate detection of cancer cells. Herein, an aptamer sandwiched nanochannel electrochemical sensor was established for the highly selective determination of cancer cells. By virtue of the porous nanochannels as the filter platform and immobilized with DNA aptamers for specifically capturing the cancer cells, the nanochannel-based electrochemical sensor denotes excellent performance for MCF-7 screening, and allowing a low limit of detection of 36&#8197;cells&#8201;mL&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The nanochannels-based sandwich structure aptasensor not only presents an efficacious and reliable approach for cancer cell detection but also provides great advantage for preventing electrode passivation in the process of biomarkers analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Funneled Depolymerization of Ionic Liquid&#8208;Based Biorefinery &#8220;Heterogeneous&#8221; Lignin into Guaiacols over Reusable Palladium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficient utilization of lignin, the direct source of renewable aromatics, into value&#8208;added renewable chemicals is an important step towards sustainable biorefinery practices. Nevertheless, owing to the random heterogeneous structure and limited solubility, lignin utilization has been primarily limited to burning for energy. The catalytic depolymerization of lignin has been proposed and demonstrated as a viable route to sustainable biorefinery, however, low yields and poor selectivity of products, high char formation, and limited to no recycling of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalyst involved in lignin depolymerization demands attention to enable practical&#8208;scale lignocellulosic biorefineries. In this study, we demonstrate the catalytic depolymerization of ionic liquid&#8208;based biorefinery poplar lignin into guaiacols over a reusable zirconium phosphate supported palladium catalyst. The essence of the study lies in the high conversion (&gt;80%), minimum char formation (7&#8208;16%), high yields of guaiacols (up to 200 mg / g of lignin), and catalyst reusability. Both solid residue, liquid stream, and gaseous products were thoroughly characterized using ICP&#8208;OES, PXRD, CHN analysis, GC&#8208;MS, GPC, and 2D NMR to understand the hydrogenolysis pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Orientational Control of Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Pyrene Clusters using a DNA Scaffold.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein investigated chiroptical activities of pyrene clusters incorporated within a DNA duplex. Three pyrene derivatives were prepared on D&#8208;threoninol linkers to allow incorporation within a DNA strand. DNA scaffolds were prepared containing dimers, tetramers, and hexamers of the pyrene derivatives. The homo dimers of 1&#8208;pyrenecarboxylic acid and of 4&#8208;pyrenecarboxylic acid, but not 2&#8208;pyrenecarboxylic acid, emitted intense circularly polarized luminescence signals. Although increasing the number of pyrene units weakened the signal, insertion of natural base pairs between two dimers enhanced its intensity. Interestingly, circularly polarized luminescence intensities varied non&#8208;monotonically depending on the number of intervening base pairs, indicating the importance of orientation between pyrene dimers. The results presented here will lead to development bright circularly polarized luminescence materials and probes.</dc:description>

         <title>The Facile Synthesis of TPE&#8208;Based Fluorophores Derived by &#960;&#8208;Extended Systems: Opposite Mechanofluorochromism, Anti&#8208;counterfeiting and Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although remarkable progresses are achieved in the design and development of the mono&#8208;shift in photoluminescence for mechanofluorochromic materials, it is still a severe challenge to explore the opposite mechanofluorochromic materials with both blue&#8208; and red&#8208;shifted photoluminescence. Herein, two unprecedented 4,5&#8208;bis(TPE)&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole fused pyridine or quinoline&#8208;based fluorophores X&#8208;1 and X&#8208;2 were designed and synthesized, and X&#8208;1 and X&#8208;2, exhibit completely opposite mechanofluorochromic behaviour. Under UV lamp, the color of pristine X&#8208;1 changed from blue to green with reversible red&#8208;shifted 27 nm in fluorescence emission spectra after ground, while the color of pristine X&#8208;2 changed from red to yellow with reversible blue&#8208;shifted 74 nm after ground. The detailed characterizations (including PXRD, SEM and DSC) confirmed that this opposite mechanofluorochromism was attributed to the transformation of order&#8208;crystalline and amorphous states. The crystal structure analysis and theoretical calculation further explain that opposite mechanofluorochromic behavior take into account different &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking mode by inducd &#960;&#8208;extended systems. In addition, these TPE&#8208;based Fluorophores (X&#8208;1 and X&#8208;2) exhibited excellent bio&#8208;compatibility and fluorescence properties for bio&#8208;imaging, writable data storage and anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Effective SrWO4/TiO2 heterojunction with enhanced carriers separation and transfer for photocatalytic methane oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic methane oxidation to oxygenates with promising performance remains as a grand challenge due to the low productivity and severe overoxidation. Herein, SrWO4/TiO2 heterojunction was developed for photocatalytic methane oxidation with O2 to liquid oxygenates products at mild reaction conditions. The optimized SrWO4/TiO2 catalyst exhibited high productivity of 13365&#160;&#956;mol/g with high selectivity of 98.7% for oxygenates. Benefited from the intimate heterojunction interface of SrWO4/TiO2, the constructed &#8544;&#8208;type heterostructure improved the separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers, and a high&#8208;speed transfer channel for photogenerated carriers was fabricated. Simultaneously, the special band structure can increase the amount of photogenerated electrons and holes on TiO2 surface, which promoted the formation of reactive oxygen species to enhance liquid oxygenates productivity.</dc:description>

The present work introduces a synthetic approach to diradicaloids by the ease and modularity of Lewis pair formation. Binding redox&#8208;active bis(catecholato)silane Lewis acids to ditopic tetraoxolene Lewis bases yields adducts with varying spin ground states. Computational analyses disclose that the diradical character increases with the electron donor ability of the catechols and the electron accepting ability of the tetraoxolene. Hence, this protocol grants access to diradicaloids with rationally adjustable diradical character of high potential for numerous applications in a single step.</dc:description>

         <title>Heteroaryl&#8208;Substituted Bis&#8208;Anils: Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) Derivatives with Tunable ESIPT Emission Color and pH Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heteroaryl&#8208;substituted bis&#8208;anil derivatives is described which present aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) coupled with an excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process.







Abstract
The two&#8208;step synthesis, structural, and photophysical properties of a series of heteroaryl&#8208;substituted bis&#8208;anil derivatives presenting aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) coupled with an excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process is described. The fluorescence color of the aggregates can be fine tuned by changing the electronic nature of the peripheral substitution, leading to a wide range of emission wavelengths (from green to the near infra&#8208;red). Moreover, upon introduction of strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups such as cyano (CN), a competition between ESIPT and deprotonation is observed leading to the emission of the anionic species at low water percentage. This observation led to the synthesis of an additional mixed AIE fluorophore, functionalized by methoxy groups on one side and cyano groups on the other side. Upon addition of water, this dye displays first anionic emission, followed by typical AIE/ESIPT red fluorescence upon formation of the aggregates. TD&#8208;DFT calculations on selected AIE dyes were performed to rationalize the nature of the emissive transitions in these derivatives.

TD-DFT calculations on selected AIE dyes were performed to rationalize the nature of the emissive transitions in these derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>m&#8208;Benziporphyrin(1.1.0.0)s as a Rare Example of Ring&#8208;Contracted Carbaporphyrins with Metal&#8208;Coordination Ability: Distorted Coordination Structures and Small HOMO&#8208;LUMO Gaps</title>

Ring contraction: m&#8208;Benziporphyrin(1.1.0.0) and m&#8208;pyreniporphyrin(1.1.0.0) were synthesized as ring&#8208;contracted carbaporphyrins with Pd coordination ability. PdII complexes of these carbaporphyrins exhibit red&#8208;shifted absorption bands and small HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps despite their small &#960;&#8208;electronic networks, probably due to the extremely short Pd&#8722;C bonds.







Abstract
m&#8208;Benziporphyrin(1.1.0.0) and m&#8208;pyreniporphyrin(1.1.0.0) were prepared as ring&#8208;contracted carbaporphyrins. While m&#8208;Benziporphyrin(1.1.0.0) was unstable, m&#8208;pyreniporphyrin(1.1.0.0) was fairly stable. Both of their PdII complexes showed distorted coordination structures with extremely short Pd&#8722;C bonds. As compared with the reported m&#8208;benziporphyrin PdII complexes, these PdII complexes showed considerably small HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps, despite their smaller molecular size. PdII metalation of the m&#8208;pyreniporphyrin(1.1.0.0) dimer gave the corresponding PdII complex, which showed similar distorted coordination and a smaller HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. Finally, PdII metalation of a pyrene&#8208;sharing formal p&#8208;benziporphyrin(1.1.1.1) dimer gave a nonaromatic PdII dimer, which rearranged to an aromatic PdII complex upon treatment with alumina.

         <title>Hierarchically Organized Cocrystal of Tetra&#8208;Anionic Porphyrin and Di&#8208;Cationic Viologen: Ion Conformations, Supramolecule Interactions, and Porphyrin Arrays</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchically organized cocrystal of meso&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;sulfonato&#8208;phenyl)&#8208;porphyrin (TSPP4&#8722;) and N, N&#8242;&#8208;diethyl&#8208;viologen (DEV2+) is reported, wherein wave&#8208;like and saddle&#8208;like TSPP4&#8722; ions co&#8208;aggregate at a stoichiometric ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 to form unique J&#8208;type porphyrin arrays. The crystal incorporates six ionic conformations which lead to intricate supramolecular interactions.







Abstract
Ionic co&#8208;assembly of tetra&#8208;anionic porphyrins has been extensively researched in the construction of hierarchically organized architectures with potential application value in organic semiconductors, sunlight catalysts and supramolecular chirality systems. However, such architectures are difficult to grow to a size suitable for single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD); the lack of single&#8208;crystal structures of these architectures leads to challenges in gaining deeper comprehension about that. This study reports a hierarchically organized cocrystal of meso&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;sulfonato&#8208;phenyl)&#8208;porphyrin (TSPP4&#8722;) and N, N&#8242;&#8208;diethyl&#8208;viologen (DEV2+), wherein wave&#8208;like and saddle&#8208;like TSPP4&#8722; ions co&#8208;aggregate at a stoichiometric ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 to form unique porphyrin arrays; the spectrum characteristics and calculated coulombic exciton coupling energy show that these porphyrin arrays are J&#8208;aggregates. We prove that the distortion of porphyrin ring of TSPP4&#8722; strongly correlates with the deflection of its phenyl groups. The crystal comprises six different ionic conformations, and the multiplicity of ionic conformation leads to intricate supramolecular interactions.

         <title>An Efficient, Site&#8208;Selective and Spontaneous Peptide Macrocyclisation During in&#8197;vitro Translation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new cyclisation approach for peptides, derived from in&#8197;vitro translation, is developed that is highly selective for N&#8208;terminal cysteines. This approach allows other cysteine residues to be exploited for further peptide diversification. A model peptide showed a large impact from this cyclisation on binding and biological activity, and molecular dynamics was used to illustrate how this cyclisation change can influence peptide conformation.







Abstract
Macrocyclisation provides a means of stabilising the conformation of peptides, often resulting in improved stability, selectivity, affinity, and cell permeability. In this work, a new approach to peptide macrocyclisation is reported, using a cyanobenzothiazole&#8208;containing amino acid that can be incorporated into peptides by both in&#8197;vitro translation and solid phase peptide synthesis, meaning it should be applicable to peptide discovery by mRNA display. This cyclisation proceeds rapidly, with minimal by&#8208;products, is selective over other amino acids including non N&#8208;terminal cysteines, and is compatible with further peptide elaboration exploiting such an additional cysteine in bicyclisation and derivatisation reactions. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the new cyclisation group is likely to influence the peptide conformation as compared to previous thioether&#8208;based approaches, through rigidity and intramolecular aromatic interactions, illustrating their complementarity.

         <title>Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution by a De Novo Designed Metalloprotein that Undergoes Ni&#8208;Mediated Oligomerization Shift</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A de novo H2 evolving metallopeptide is constructed from first principles, which undergoes oligomerization change in the presence of NiII. Under white light, the metallopeptide produces H2 via a reductive quenching pathway. The timescales of ET and the role of thiol pKa is determined from TAS kinetics and pH titration experiments, respectively. Outer sphere steric modulation shows preferential binding of H+ to Ni from N&#8208;termini.







Abstract
De novo metalloprotein design involves the construction of proteins guided by specific repeat patterns of polar and apolar residues, which, upon self&#8208;assembly, provide a suitable environment to bind metals and produce artificial metalloenzymes. While a wide range of functionalities have been realized in de novo designed metalloproteins, the functional repertoire of such constructs towards alternative energy&#8208;relevant catalysis is currently limited. Here we show the application of de novo approach to design a functional H2 evolving protein. The design involved the assembly of an amphiphilic peptide featuring cysteines at tandem a/d sites of each helix. Intriguingly, upon NiII addition, the oligomers shift from a major trimeric assembly to a mix of dimers and trimers. The metalloprotein produced H2 photocatalytically with a bell&#8208;shape pH dependence, having a maximum activity at pH&#8197;5.5. Transient absorption spectroscopy is used to determine the timescales of electron transfer as a function of pH. Selective outer sphere mutations are made to probe how the local environment tunes activity. A preferential enhancement of activity is observed via steric modulation above the NiII site, towards the N&#8208;termini, compared to below the NiII site towards the C&#8208;termini.

         <dc:description>
Covalent Triazine Frameworks have received great attention as an attractive photocatalyst owing to their unique structure characteristics. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the CTFs&#8217; synthetic methods, crystallization, and applications for photocatalytic water splitting. The perspectives and challenges of fabricating high crystalline CTFs and designing CTFs with excellent photocatalytic performance are also discussed.







Abstract
Covalent Triazine Frameworks (CTFs) have received great attention from academia owing to their unique structure characteristics such as nitrogen&#8208;rich structure, chemical stability, fully conjugated skeleton and high surface area; all these unique properties make CTFs attractive for widespread applications, especially for photocatalytic applications. In this review, we aim to provide recent advances in the CTFs preparation, and mainly focus on their photocatalytic applications. This review provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of the CTFs&#8217; synthetic methods, crystallinity lifting strategies, and their applications for photocatalytic water splitting. Firstly, a brief background including the photocatalytic water splitting and crystallinity are provided. Then, synthetic methods related to CTFs and the strategies for enhancing the crystallinity are summarized and compared. After that, the general photocatalytic mechanism and the strategies to improve the photocatalytic performance of CTFs are discussed. Finally, the perspectives and challenges of fabricating high crystalline CTFs and designing CTFs with excellent photocatalytic performance are discussed, inspiring the development of CTF materials in photocatalytic applications.

One pot, many products: A novel method is reported for the general synthesis of spiro&#8208;indenyl 1,4&#8208;benzoxazins and 2&#8208;(2,2&#8208;diarylvinyl)quinoxalines by FeIII&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization of propargylic alcohols. The hall&#8208;marks of the method are the use of low&#8208;cost substrates and an environmentally benign iron catalyst, high tolerance towards various functional groups, and switchable product formation.







Abstract
We report herein unprecedented cascade reactions of O&#8208;propargyl&#8208;N&#8208;tosyl&#8208;amino phenols with 10&#8197;mol% FeCl3 in DCE at room temperature for 0.67&#8211;3&#8197;h to form spiro&#8208;indenyl 1,4&#8208;benzoxazines with 38&#8211;89&#8201;% yield. Replacing the substrates&#8217; oxygen atom by a N&#8208;tosylimine group followed by treatment with the same catalyst and solvent at 80&#8201;&#176;C produced 2&#8208;(2,2&#8208;diarylvinyl)quinoxalines in 12&#8211;20&#8197;h with up to 62&#8201;% yield. Mechanistic understanding provided an insight into the transformations. The use of simple substrates and an environmentally benign low&#8208;cost catalyst, broad substrate scope and tolerance of diverse functional groups makes the methodology inherently attractive.

         <title>Dinitrogen Activation in the Gas Phase: Spectroscopic Characterization of C&#8722;N Coupling in the V3C++N2 Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of V3C+ with N2 is studied using IRPD spectroscopy. The cleavage of N&#8801;N bond and the subsequent C&#8722;N coupling is undoubtedly confirmed by the observed IR&#8208;active C=N stretching fundamental in the fingerprint region of the vibrational action spectrum. This work represents the first spectroscopic observation of the formed C&#8722;N bond directly from N2 in gas phase.







Abstract
We report on cluster&#8208;mediated C&#8722;N bond formation in the gas phase using N2 as a nitrogen source. The V3C++N2 reaction is studied by a combination of ion&#8208;trap mass spectrometry with infrared photodissociation (IRPD) spectroscopy and complemented by electronic structure calculations. The proposed reaction mechanism is spectroscopically validated by identifying the structures of the reactant and product ions. V3C+ exhibits a pyramidal structure of C1&#8208;symmetry. N2 activation is initiated by adsorption in an end&#8208;on fashion at a vanadium site, followed by spontaneous cleavage of the N&#8801;N triple bond and subsequent C&#8722;N coupling. The IRPD spectrum of the metal nitride product [NV3(C=N)]+ exhibits characteristic C=N double bond (1530&#8197;cm&#8722;1) and V&#8722;N single bond (770, 541 and 522&#8197;cm&#8722;1) stretching bands.

         <title>Oxychalcogenides: A Promising Class of Materials for Nonlinear Optical Crystals with Mixed&#8208;Anion Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The best of all worlds: Oxychalcogenides, promising IR NLO materials candidates, can integrate the property superiority of different anion groups, for example, the strong SHG response and wide IR transmission of metal chalcogenides and the large band gap and high laser damage threshold of oxides.







Abstract
Infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) materials are of great significance in the development of IR laser technology. But rationally designing high&#8208;performance IR NLO materials remains a huge challenge due to the conflict between the necessary properties required for NLO materials. Notably, oxychalcogenides with mixed&#8208;anion groups have drawn extensive interest as a family of important IR NLO candidates because they integrate the property advantages of oxides and chalcogenides by chemical substitution engineering. In this review, we provide a survey of reported oxychalcogenides and aim to present the development of NLO oxychalcogenides from the perspective of rational design of their structural chemistry. Furthermore, we focus on the relationships between partial substitution and structural symmetry as well as optical properties. These provide some helpful guidance for the further exploration and design of novel oxychalcogenide materials with excellent NLO performance in the future.

         <title>Molecular Insights into Bifunctional Ambruticin DH3 for Substrate Specificity and Catalytic Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The theoretical study uncovers both the structural rationale for substrate specificity of the first bifunctional dehydratase&#8208;cyclase AsmDH3 and a complete one&#8208;base catalytic mechanism including dehydration and cyclization.







Abstract
Dehydratase (DH), a domain located at polyketide synthase (PKS) modules, commonly catalyzes the dehydration of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy to an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl intermediate. As a unique bifunctional dehydratase, AmbDH3 (the DH domain of module 3 of the ambruticin PKS) is verified to be responsible for both dehydration and the following pyran&#8208;forming cyclization. Besides, in&#8197;vitro studies showed that its catalytic efficiency varies with different chiral substrates. However, the detailed molecular mechanism of AmbDH3 remains unclear. In this work, the structural rationale for the substrate specificity (2R/2S&#8208; and 6R/6S&#8208;substrates) in AmbDH3 was elucidated and the complete reaction pathways including dehydration and cyclization were presented. Both MD simulations and binding free energy calculations indicated AmbDH3 had a stronger preference for 2R&#8208;substrates (2R6R&#8208;2, 2R6S&#8208;3) than 2S&#8208;substrates (2S6R&#8208;1), and residue H51 and G61 around the catalytic pocket were emphasized by forming stable hydrogen bonds with 2R&#8208;substrates. In addition, AmbDH3&#8217;s mild tolerance at C6 was explained by comparison of substrate conformation and hydrogen bond network in 6S&#8208; and 6R&#8208;substrate systems. The QM/MM results supported a consecutive one&#8208;base dehydration and cyclization mechanism for 2R6S&#8208;3 substrate with the energy barrier of 25.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and 24.5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively. Our computational results uncover the substrate recognition and catalytic process of the first bifunctional dehydratase&#8208;cyclase AmbDH3, which will shed light on the application of multifunctional DH domains in PKSs for diverse natural product analogs and benefit the chemoenzymatic synthesis of stereoselective pyran&#8208;containing products.

The QM/MM results supported a consecutive one-base dehydration and cyclization mechanism for &lt;i&gt;2R6S&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; substrate with the energy barrier of 25.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 24.5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Our computational results uncover the substrate recognition and catalytic process of the first bifunctional dehydratase-cyclase AmbDH3, which will shed light on the application of multifunctional DH domains in PKSs for diverse natural product analogs and benefit the chemoenzymatic synthesis of stereoselective pyran-containing products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Absolute Configuration Determination of Chiral API Molecules by MicroED Analysis of Cocrystal Powders Formed Based on Cocrystal Propensity Prediction Calculations
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new and robust pipeline for absolute configuration determination is presented here. First, virtual screening selects chiral probes compatible with the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Second, crystallization trials produce microcrystals suitable for analysis without further optimization. Finally, MicroED is used to determine the crystal structure. The absolute configuration of the API can be confidently assigned relative to the chiral probe.







Abstract
Establishing the absolute configuration of chiral active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is of great importance. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (scXRD) has traditionally been the method of choice for such analysis, but scXRD requires the growth of large crystals, which can be challenging. Here, we present a method for determining absolute configuration that does not rely on the growth of large crystals. By examining microcrystals formed with chiral probes (small chiral compounds such as amino acids), absolute configuration can be unambiguously determined by microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED). Our streamlined method employs three steps: (1) virtual screening to identify promising chiral probes, (2) experimental cocrystal screening and (3) structure determination by MicroED and absolute configuration assignment. We successfully applied this method to analyze two chiral API molecules currently on the market for which scXRD was not used to determine absolute configuration.

         <title>Automated Glycan Assembly of Mycobacterial Hexaarabinofuranoside and Docosasaccharide Arabinan (Arbf23) Motifs found on&#160;Mycobacterium tuberculosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mycobacteria&#160;are covered in a thick layer of different polysaccharides that helps to avert the innate immune response. Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) and arabinogalactan (AG) are ubiquitously contained in these envelopes and rapid access to defined oligo&#8208; and polysaccharides is essential to elucidate their structural and biological roles. Arabinofuranose (Araf)residues in LAM and AG are connected either via&#160;&#945;&#8208;1,2&#8208;trans&#160;linkages that are synthetically straightforward to install or the more challenging&#160;&#946;&#8208;(1,2&#8208;cis) linkages. Here, we demonstrate that automated glycan assembly (AGA) can be used to quickly prepare 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Araf&#160;as illustrated by the assembly of a highly branched arabinan hexasaccharide and a docosasaccharide arabinan (Araf23) motif</dc:description>

         <title>Enantiodivergent Sulfoxidation Catalyzed by a Photoswitchable Iron Salen Phosphate Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we describe a photoswitchable iron(III) salen phosphate catalyst, which is able to catalyze the enantiodivergent oxidation of prochiral aryl alkyl sulfides to chiral aryl alkyl sulfoxides. The stable (S)&#8208;axial isomer of the catalyst produced enantioenriched sulfoxides with the (R)&#8208;configuration in up to 75% e.e., whereas the photoisomerized metastable (R)&#8208;axial isomer of the catalyst favored the formation of (S)&#8208;sulfoxides in up to 43% e.e. The maximum &#916;e.e. value obtained in the enantiodivergent sulfoxidation was 118%, which is identical to the maximum &#916;e.e. value that was measured in the enantiodivergent epoxidation of alkenes by a related recently described Mn1 catalyst. This iron&#8208;based catalyst broadens the scope of photoswitchable enantiodivergent catalysts and may use in the future to develop a photoswitchable catalytic system that can write digital information on a polymer chain in the form chiral sulfoxide functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Styrene Oxide Isomerase&#8208;Catalyzed Meinwald Rearrangement in Cascade Biotransformations: Synthesis of Chiral and/or Natural Chemicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Styrene oxide isomerase (SOI) catalyzes the Meinwald rearrangement of aryl epoxides to carbonyl compounds via a 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;shift in a stereospecific manner. A number of cascade biotransformations with SOI&#8208;catalyzed epoxide isomerization as a key step have been developed to convert readily available substrates into valuable chiral chemicals. Cascade conversion of terminal or internal alkenes into chiral acids, alcohols or amines were achieved, which involved SOI&#8208;catalyzed enantio&#8208;retentive isomerization of terminal epoxides via 1,2&#8208;H shift, or internal epoxides via 1,2&#8208;methyl shift. SOI&#8208;involved cascades were also developed to convert racemic epoxides into chiral acids or amines via dynamic kinetic resolution. Additionally, combining SOI&#8208;catalyzed isomerization with enantioselective C&#8211;C bond forming enzymes enabled the synthesis of chiral amino acids or amino alcohols from racemic epoxides. Finally, integration of SOI&#8208;involved cascades with biosynthesis pathways allowed for the direct utilization of renewable substrates for the sustainable synthesis of high&#8208;value natural chemicals such as alcohols, acids and esters.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An atropisomerism of large cycloarylenes was studied using [n]cyclo&#8208;4,10&#8208;pyrenylenes (n = 6&#8211;21) as an illustrative example with two simple assumptions: (1) alternating configurations (R,S,R,S,,,) are thermodynamically most stable, and (2) three consecutive identical configurations (R,R,R or S,S,S) are prevented. Ni&#8208;mediated coupling of a 5,9&#8208;diiodopyrene gave a series of directly&#8208;linked cyclic pyrene oligomers in one&#8208;pot reaction. As&#8208;synthesized cyclic hexamer was assigned as an (R,S,S,R,R,S) structure, converted into an (R,S,R,S,R,S)&#8208;form upon heating. Cyclic heptamer consists of two types of C2 symmetric structures predicted from assumption (2), one of which was convergent to one another by heating. Three atropisomers of cyclic octamer were analyzed from the possible five candidates by means of 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and the conversion process to (R,S,R,S,R,S,R,S) configurations upon heating was investigated. In total, according to two simple rules, the analysis of atropisomerism could be performed smoothly.</dc:description>

         <title>Antimicrobial Conjugated Oligoelectrolytes Containing Triphenylphosphonium Solubilizing Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs) are an emerging class of amphiphilic antimicrobial compounds with a modular molecular framework suitable for simple chemical derivatization. Here, a series of COE derivatives with a stilbene conjugated segment and triphenylphosphonium (TPP) pendant groups was designed and synthesized to understand how lipophilic cationic groups impact antimicrobial activity. In vitro evaluations against ESKAPE pathogens showed broad&#8208;spectrum activity towards multi&#8208;drug resistant (MDR) bacteria and mycobacteria, with TPP groups enhancing antimicrobial activity towards clinically&#8208;relevant Gram&#8208;negative strains compared to their ammonium analogues. We studied the interactions of DM6P, the most active TPP&#8208;COE compound, with various membrane assays. Treatment of bacterial cells with DM6P showed enhanced permeability of cell membranes without inducing significant bacterial resistance development. Moreover, DM6P eliminated 99.99% of methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphyloccocus aureus (MRSA) in an in vivo wound model. These results represent a promising chemical strategy for increasing the activity spectrum of membrane&#8208;active COE antibiotics to tackle challenging drug&#8208;resistant targets.</dc:description>

         <title>Emerging Trends in Closed&#8208;loop Recycling Polymers: Monomer Design and Catalytic Bulk Depolymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plastics are indispensable materials in modern society; however, their extensive use has contributed to the depletion of finite natural resources and caused severe environmental issues. One end&#8208;of&#8208;use solution for plastics involves the chemical recycling of polymers back to monomers for repolymerization to virgin polymers without changing the material properties, allowing the establishment of a circular material economy. This concept focuses on the critical advantages of chemically recyclable polymers in terms of monomer design, material properties, and the feasibility of bulk depolymerization. The recyclability via bulk thermolysis of various polyesters, CO2&#8208;based polycarbonates, and polyacetals produced via ring&#8208;opening polymerization is highlighted through discussions regarding rational monomer design and efficient catalyst development. An outlook and perspective are provided to delineate the future challenges in the rational design of monomer and polymer structures that deliver the desired materials performance while being suitable for bulk thermolysis with high (de)polymerization activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Buried Interface Regulation by Bio&#8208;Functional Molecules for Efficient and Stable Planar Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for planar&#8208;type perovskite solar cells by natural bio&#8208;functional interfaces that uses a buried electron&#8208;transport layer made of cobalamin complexed tin oxide (SnO2@B12) is provided. Cobalamin could chemically link SnO2 layer and perovskite layer, resulting in improved perovskite film quality and interfacial defect passivation.







Abstract
Among the factors that lead to the reduction of the efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) the difficulty involved in realizing a high&#8208;quality film and the efficient charge transfer that takes place at the interface between electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) and perovskite is worth mentioning. Here, a strategy for planar&#8208;type devices by natural bio&#8208;functional interfaces that uses a buried electron&#8208;transport layer made of cobalamin complexed tin oxide (SnO2@B12) is demonstrated. Having systematically investigated the effects of SnO2@B12 interfacial layer in perovskite solar cells, it can be concluded that cobalamin can chemically link the SnO2 layer and the perovskite layer, resulting in improved perovskite film quality and interfacial defect passivation. Utilizing SnO2@B12 improves the efficiency of planar&#8208;type PSCs by 20.60&#8201;%. Furthermore, after 250&#8197;h of exposure to an ambient atmosphere, unsealed PSCs containing SnO2@B12 degrade by 10&#8201;%. This research provides a viable method for developing bio&#8208;functional molecules that will increase the effectiveness and durability of planar&#8208;perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Higher&#8208;Order Cycloaddition Reactions for the Construction of Polycyclic Aromatic and Polycyclic Heteroaromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, the interest in polycyclic (hetero)aromatic compounds has steadily increased as the versatility of these in material science are explored, for example in fluorescent probes and pyroelectronics. In this concept, recent advances in organocatalysed higher&#8208;order cycloadditions as a synthetic tool to access novel polycyclic (hetero)aromatic compounds are demonstrated.







Abstract
Cycloadditions are an important class of reactions in materials science for the construction of polycyclic aromatic and polycyclic heteroaromatic compounds. Recently, cycloadditions have been expanded beyond the &#8220;classical&#8221; group of cycloadditions involving six &#960;&#8208;electrons, and it is now possible to control cycloadditions for an extended number of &#960;&#8208;electrons by applying organocatalysis. This novel field of cycloadditions&#8211;termed higher&#8208;order cycloadditions&#8211;allows new synthetic methodologies to construct polycyclic carbo&#8208; and heteroaromatic compounds in two or three dimensions. This concept presents higher&#8208;order cycloadditions as a method for accessing two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional azulenes and cyclazines, as well as three dimensional indenes, as polycyclic aromatic and polycyclic heteroaromatic compounds.

         <title>Precise Control of Dissipative Self&#8208;assembly by Light and Electricity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature&#8208;inspired synthetic dissipative self&#8208;assemblies have attracted much attention recently. However, it remains a major challenge to achieve precise control over dissipative supramolecular assembly structures and functions of self&#8208;contained systems. Here we combine light and electricity as two clean, and spatiotemporally addressable fuels to provide precise control over the morphology for dissipative self&#8208;assembly of a perylene bisimide glycine (PBIg) building block in a self&#8208;contained solution. In this design, electrochemical oxidation provides the positive fuel to activate PBIg self&#8208;assembly while photoreduction supplies the negative fuel to deactivate the system for disassembly. Through programming the two counteracting fuels, we demonstrated the control of PBIg self&#8208;assembly into a variety of assembly morphologies in a self&#8208;contained system. In addition, by exerting light and electrical dual fuels simultaneously, we could create an active homeostasis exhibiting dynamic instability, leading to morphological change to asymmetric assemblies with curvatures. Such precise control over self&#8208;assembly of self&#8208;contained systems may find future applications in programming complex active materials as well as formulating pharmaceutical reagents with desired morphologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Bringing Machine&#8208;Learning Enhanced Quantum Chemistry and Microwave Spectroscopy to Conformational Landscape Exploration: the Paradigmatic Case of 4&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;Threonine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A combined experimental and theoretical study has been carried out on 4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;threonine, the only naturally occurring fluorinated amino acid. Fluorination of the methyl group significantly increases the conformational complexity with respect to the parent amino acid threonine. The conformational landscape has been characterized in great detail, with special attention given to the inter&#8208;conversion pathways between different conformers. This led to the identification of 13 stable low&#8208;energy minima. The equilibrium population of so many conformers produces a very complicated and congested rotational spectrum that could be assigned through a strategy that combines several levels of quantum chemical calculations with the principles of machine learning. Twelve conformers out of 13 could be experimentally characterized. The results obtained from the analysis of the intra&#8208;molecular interactions can be exploited to accurately model fluorine&#8208;substitution effects in biomolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Activatable Fluorescent Probes Targeting Urokinase&#8208;Type Plasminogen Activator Receptor on the Cell Membrane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Urokinase&#8208;type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) is a glycolipid&#8208;anchored protein located on the cell surface that is implicated in the promotion of metastasis. New fluorescent probes for the detection of uPAR expression that feature a rapid &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; response are here reported. They consist of a donor&#8208;p&#8208;acceptor&#8208;based fluorophore conjugated with a uPAR&#8208;binding AE105 peptide. The resulting AE105&#8208;coupled uPAR&#8208;targeting probes are weakly emissive in aqueous buffer solutions; however, a fluorescence &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; signal is instantly triggered upon specific binding to uPAR (KD = 63.2 nM for P1 and 49.5 nM for P2), which restricts the rotational deactivation of the fluorophore. Applications of the probes were demonstrated in the imaging of uPAR overexpressed on the membrane of cancer cell and in a cell&#8208;based uPAR inhibitor assay.</dc:description>

         <title>Aqueous binders compatible with ionic liquid electrolyte for high&#8208;performance aluminum&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incompatibility of poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) with acidic ionic liquid electrolytes and the use of toxic and high&#8208;cost N&#8208;Methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) solvents hinder the wide application of aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs). In this work, sodium alginate (Na&#8208;Alg) is developed as an aqueous binder for the fabrication of graphite positive electrodes in AIBs. The compatibility of various binders with the ionic liquid electrolyte is evaluated, and interaction between various binders and graphite particles before and after cycling is compared and discussed. The results demonstrate that the well compatibility of Na&#8208;Alg in ionic liquids and its reasonable distribution on the graphite surface facilitate fast charge transfer and ion diffusion, reduce electrode polarization, and thus contributing to significantly improved cycling stability and rate capability of AIBs. This work provides a new insight into the development of low&#8208;cost, eco&#8208;friendly, and high&#8208;performance binders for AIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Electroreduction of Carbon Dioxide to Acetate using Heterogenized Hydrophilic Manganese Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tunable catalysts: Heterogeneous Mn&#8208;porphyrin molecular electrocatalysts are used to efficiently reduce CO2 to acetate in an aqueous environment with a selectivity of 62&#8201;% when immobilized on a glassy carbon electrode using a one&#8208;pot electrografting method. The vertical alignment and higher loading of the electrografted molecules is enabled by the hydrophilic sulfonate groups.







Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to value&#8208;added chemicals is a promising strategy to mitigate climate change. Metalloporphyrins have been used as a promising class of stable and tunable catalysts for the electrochemical reduction reaction of CO2 (CO2RR) but have been primarily restricted to single&#8208;carbon reduction products. Here, we utilize functionalized earth&#8208;abundant manganese tetraphenylporphyrin&#8208;based (Mn&#8208;TPP) molecular electrocatalysts that have been immobilized via electrografting onto a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) to convert CO2 with overall 94&#8201;% Faradaic efficiencies, with 62&#8201;% being converted to acetate. Tuning of Mn&#8208;TPP with electron&#8208;withdrawing sulfonate groups (Mn&#8208;TPPS) introduced mechanistic changes arising from the electrostatic interaction between the sulfonate groups and water molecules, resulting in better surface coverage, which facilitated higher conversion rates than the non&#8208;functionalized Mn&#8208;TPP. For Mn&#8208;TPP only carbon monoxide and formate were detected as CO2 reduction products. Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the additional sulfonate groups could alter the C&#8722;C coupling pathway from *CO&#8594;*COH&#8594;*COH&#8208;CO to *CO&#8594;*CO&#8208;CO&#8594;*COH&#8208;CO, reducing the free energy barrier of C&#8722;C coupling in the case of Mn&#8208;TPPS. This opens a new approach to designing metalloporphyrin catalysts for two carbon products in CO2RR.

         <title>Magnetic Anisotropy and Relaxation of Pseudotetrahedral [N2O2] Bis&#8208;Chelate Cobalt(II) Single&#8208;Ion Magnets Controlled by Dihedral Twist Through Solvomorphism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt(II)&#8208;based single&#8208;ion magnet is described, for which the zero&#8208;field splitting could be increased by driving the dihedral twist distortion between the planes of the chelate ligands to a new record level. FD&#8208;FT THz&#8208;EPR experiments were used to validate the corroborating ab initio calculations and susceptibility data, and enabled magnetic relaxation analysis identifying spin&#8208;phonon coupling processes.







Abstract
The methanol solvomorph 1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MeOH of the cobalt(II) complex [Co(LSal,2&#8722;Ph)2] (1) with the sterically demanding Schiff&#8208;base ligand 2&#8208;(([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2&#8208;ylimino)methyl)phenol (HLSal,2&#8722;Ph) shows the thus far largest dihedral twist distortion between the two chelate planes compared to an ideal pseudotetrahedral arrangement. The cobalt(II) ion in 1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MeOH exhibits an easy&#8208;axis anisotropy leading to a spin&#8208;reversal barrier of 55.3&#8197;cm&#8722;1, which corresponds to an increase of about 17&#8201;% induced by the larger dihedral twist compared to the solvent&#8208;free complex 1. The magnetic relaxation for 1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MeOH is significantly slower compared to 1. An in&#8208;depth frequency&#8208;domain Fourier&#8208;transform (FD&#8208;FT) THz&#8208;EPR study not only allowed the direct measurement of the magnetic transition between the two lowest Kramers doublets for the cobalt(II) complexes, but also revealed the presence of spin&#8208;phonon coupling. Interestingly, a similar dihedral twist correlation is also observed for a second pair of cobalt(II)&#8208;based solvomorphs, which could be benchmarked by FD&#8208;FT THz&#8208;EPR.

         <title>Molecular Design and Crystal Chemistry of Polyfluorinated Naphthalene&#8208;bis&#8208;phenylhydrazimides with Superior Thermal and Polymorphic Stability and High Solution Processability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyfluorinated naphthalene&#8208;bis&#8208;phenylhydrazimides show high chemical and thermal inertness, possess rather low LUMO energies (down to &#8722;4.37&#8197;eV) and significantly high solubilities.

Naphthalene tetracarboxylic diimides (NDIs) are highly promising air&#8208;stable n&#8208;type molecular semiconductor candidates for flexible and cost&#8208;effective organic solar cells and thermoelectrics. Nonetheless, thermal and polymorphic stabilities of environmentally stable NDIs in the low&#8208;to&#8208;medium temperature regime (&lt;300&#8201;&#176;C) remain challenging properties. Structural, thermal, spectroscopic, and computational features of polyfluorinated NDI&#8208;based molecular solids (with up to 14 F atoms per NDI molecule) are discussed upon increasing the fluorination level. Slip&#8208;stacked arrangement of the NDI cores with suitable &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and systematically short interplanar distances (&lt;3.2&#8197;&#197;) are found. All these materials exhibit superior thermal stability (up to 260&#8201;&#176;C or above) and thermal expansion coefficients indicating a response compatible with flexible polymeric substrates. Optical bandgaps increase from 2.78 to 2.93&#8197;eV with fluorination, while LUMO energy levels decrease down to &#8722;4.37&#8197;eV, as shown per DFT calculations. The compounds exhibit excellent solubility of 30&#8197;mg mL&#8722;1 in 1,4&#8208;dioxane and DMF.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Polyfluorinated naphthalene-bis-phenylhydrazimides&lt;/b&gt; show high chemical and thermal inertness, possess rather low LUMO energies (down to &#8722;4.37&#8197;eV) and significantly high solubilities. All these features indicate that they are promising n-type semiconductors for a variety of organic electronics applications.

A human dive into the ocean of &#945;&#8208;SOMO levels: Exhaled oxygen bubbles cause peroxidation of radical&#8208;type mechanophores (RMs), which generate shallow &#945;&#8208;SOMO level radical species; however, RMs that generate deep &#945;&#8208;SOMO level radical species did not afford peroxide compounds. One of the C&#8722;C RMs was applied to the design of a mechanoresponsive polymer. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Otsuka, K. Mikami, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Quantum Yield of DNA Strand Breaks under Photoexcitation of a Molecular Ruby</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) used for treating cancer relies on the generation of highly reactive oxygen species, e.g. singlet oxygen 1O2, by light&#8208;induced excitation of a photosensitizer (PS) in the presence of molecular oxygen, inducing DNA damage in close proximity of the PS. Although many precious metal complexes have been explored as PS for PDT and received clinical approval, only recently, the potential of photoactive complexes of bio&#8208;essential metals as PS was discovered. Using the DNA origami technology that can absolutely quantify DNA strand break cross sections, we assessed the potential of the luminescent transition metal complex [Cr(ddpd)2]3+ (ddpd = N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;dipyridine&#8208;2&#8208;ylpyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine) to damage DNA in an air&#8208;saturated aqueous environment upon low energy UV/Vis illumination. The quantum yield for strand breakage, i.e., the ratio of DNA strand breaks to the number of absorbed photons, was determined to 1 &#8211; 4%, indicating efficient transformation of photons into DNA strand breaks by [Cr(ddpd)2]3+.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of sterically encumbered alkaline&#8208;earth metal amides applying the in&#8208;situ Grignard reagent formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnesium and calcium are too inert to deprotonate amines directly. For the synthesis of bulky amides alternative strategies are required and in the past, N&#8208;bound trialkylsilyl groups have been used to ease metalation reactions. The in&#8208;situ Grignard reagent formation in stirred suspensions of magnesium or calcium with hydryl halide and imine in THF allows the synthesis of a plethora of amides with bulky silyl&#8208;free substituents. Ball milling protocols partially favor competitive side reactions such as aza&#8208;pinacol coupling reactions. Calcium is the advantageous choice for the in&#8208;situ Grignard reagent formation and subsequent addition onto the imines yielding bulky calcium bis(amides) whereas the stronger reducing heavier alkaline&#8208;earth metals strontium and barium are less selective and hence, the aza&#8208;pinacol coupling reaction becomes competitive. Exemplary, the solid&#8208;state molecular structures of [(Et2O)Mg(N(Ph)(CHPh2)2] and [(Et2O)2Ca(N(Ph)(CHPh2)2] have been determined.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity of oxygen&#8208;bridged geminal Al/P and Si/P Frustrated Lewis Pairs towards heterocumulenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The two oxygen&#8208;bridged geminal Frustrated Lewis Pairs (FLP) tBu2P&#8211;O&#8211;AlBis2 (Bis = CH(SiMe3)2, 1) and tBu2P&#8211;O&#8211;Si(C2F5)3 (2) were reacted with the heterocumulenes PhNCO, PhOCN, PhNCS, CS2 and PhNSO as well as SO2. With isocyanate and cyanate, both 1 and 2, form addition products under formation of five&#8208;membered rings. With CS2, isothiocyanate and sulfinylaniline only 1 forms stable adducts, while 2 shows reactivity towards sulfinylaniline but the product decomposed after several minutes. The reaction of 1 with SO2 led to a partial cleavage of the P&#8208;O&#8208;Al and Al&#8208;C units, confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of a complex aggregate. The reaction of 2 with SO2 affords the 1,2&#8208;addition product. All adducts were characterized by means of multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography and CHN analyses.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of B4N4&#8208;Heteropentalenes Fused with Polycyclic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid molecules of &#960;&#8208;conjugated carbon rings and BN&#8208;heterocyclic rings (h&#8208;CBNs) fused with each other have been a rare class of compounds due to the limited availability of their synthetic methods. Here we report the synthesis of new h&#8208;CBNs (1, Figure 1d) featuring a B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene core and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon wings. Using 1,2&#8208;azaborinine derivatives as a building block, we developed a rational synthetic protocol that allows the formation of a B4N4 ring in a stepwise manner, resulting in the fully fused ABA&#8208;type triblock molecules. Thus, three derivatives of 1 bearing naphthalene (1Naph), anthracene (1Anth), or phenanthrene (1Phen) wings fused with the B4N4 core were synthesized and characterized. Among them, 1Phen which displays the highest triplet&#8208;state energy was found to serve a host material for phosphorescent OLED devices, for which a maximum external quantum efficiency of 13.7% was recorded. These findings may promote the synthesis of various types of h&#8208;CBNs aiming at new properties arising from the synergy of two different &#960;&#8208;electronic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances in Selective Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation of Alkynes to Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes is a potential candidate to traditional thermocatalytic process. Alkynes adsorption, hydrogenation and alkenes desorption intrinsically determine the activity and alkene selectivity. In this review, the advances in electrocatalysts and electrolyzers for selective hydrogenation of alkynes are focused.







Abstract
Selective electrochemical hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes under ambient conditions is a promising alternative to the traditional energy&#8208;intensive and high&#8208;cost thermocatalytic hydrogenation. However, the systematic summary on the electrocatalysts and electrolyzers remains lacked. Herein, we demonstrate a comprehensive review about recent achievements in the electrocatalysts including noble metal and non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal materials. Several effective strategies of catalyst design were developed to improve alkyne conversion, and alkene selectivity, for example, accelerating the formation of active hydrogen species, enhancing alkyne adsorption and suppressing the side reactions. Furthermore, the advantages and disadvantages of various electrolyzers are systematically discussed. Accordingly, major challenges and future trends in this field are proposed.

         <title>CRISPR/Cas&#8208;Based MicroRNA Biosensors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of efficient biosensors for miRNA assay is essential for disease diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis. CRISPR/Cas system possesses high fidelity, precise localization capability, and efficient cleavage activity, making it attractive in biosensing applications. In this review, the recent advances in the development of CRISPR/Cas&#8208;based biosensors for miRNAs assay are discussed.







Abstract
As important post&#8208;transcriptional regulators, microRNAs (miRNAs) play irreplaceable roles in diverse cellular functions. Dysregulated miRNA expression is implicated in various diseases including cancers, and thus miRNAs have become the valuable biomarkers for disease monitoring. Recently, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR&#8208;associated (CRISPR/Cas) system has shown great promise for the development of next&#8208;generation biosensors because of its precise localization capability, good fidelity, and high cleavage activity. Herein, we review recent advance in development of CRISPR/Cas&#8208;based biosensors for miRNA detection. We summarize the principles, features, and performance of these miRNA biosensors, and further highlight the remaining challenges and future directions.

         <title>Red&#8208;to&#8208;Near&#8208;Infrared Emitting PyrrolylBODIPY Dyes: Synthesis, Photophysical Properties and Bioimaging Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Series of pyrrolylBODIPYs were regioselectively synthesized through SNAr reactions between pyrroles and 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrachloroBODIPYs or 3,5&#8208;dibromoBODIPY. The resulting pyrrolylBODIPYs with 5&#8208;Cl substituent can be further functionalized to give a series of red&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared emitting dyes and a mitochondrial localization fluorescent probe was further developed.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores with characteristics such as deep tissue penetration, minimal damage to the biological samples, and low background interference, are highly sought&#8208;after materials for in&#8197;vivo and deep&#8208;tissue fluorescence imaging. Herein, series of 3&#8208;pyrrolylBODIPY derivatives and 3,5&#8208;dipyrrolylBODIPY derivatives have been prepared by a facile regioselective nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction (SNAr) on 3,5&#8208;halogenated BODIPY derivatives (3,5&#8208;dibromo or 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrachloroBODIPYs) with pyrroles. The installation of a pyrrolic unit onto the 3&#8208;position of the BODIPY chromophore leads to a dramatic red shift of both the absorption (up to 160&#8197;nm) and the emission (up to 260&#8197;nm) in these resultant 3&#8208;pyrrolylBODIPYs with respect to that of the BODIPY chromophore. Their further 5&#8208;positional functionalization provides a facile way to fine tune their photophysical properties, and these resulting dipyrrolylBODIPYs and functionalized pyrrolylBODIPYs show strong absorption in the deep red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR regions (595&#8211;684&#8197;nm) and intense NIR fluorescence emission (650&#8211;715&#8197;nm) in dichloromethane. To demonstrate the applicability of these functionalized pyrrolylBODIPYs as NIR fluorescent probes for cell imaging, pyrrolylBODIPY 6&#8201;a containing mitochondrion&#8208;targeting butyltriphenylphosphonium cationic species was also prepared. It selectively localized in mitochondria of HeLa cells, with low cytotoxicity and intense deep red fluorescence emission.

&lt;p&gt;Near-infrared (NIR) fluorophores with characteristics such as deep tissue penetration, minimal damage to the biological samples, and low background interference, are highly sought-after materials for in&#8197;vivo and deep-tissue fluorescence imaging. Herein, series of 3-pyrrolylBODIPY derivatives and 3,5-dipyrrolylBODIPY derivatives have been prepared by a facile regioselective nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction (S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;Ar) on 3,5-halogenated BODIPY derivatives (3,5-dibromo or 2,3,5,6-tetrachloroBODIPYs) with pyrroles. The installation of a pyrrolic unit onto the 3-position of the BODIPY chromophore leads to a dramatic red shift of both the absorption (up to 160&#8197;nm) and the emission (up to 260&#8197;nm) in these resultant 3-pyrrolylBODIPYs with respect to that of the BODIPY chromophore. Their further 5-positional functionalization provides a facile way to fine tune their photophysical properties, and these resulting dipyrrolylBODIPYs and functionalized pyrrolylBODIPYs show strong absorption in the deep red-to-NIR regions (595&#8211;684&#8197;nm) and intense NIR fluorescence emission (650&#8211;715&#8197;nm) in dichloromethane. To demonstrate the applicability of these functionalized pyrrolylBODIPYs as NIR fluorescent probes for cell imaging, pyrrolylBODIPY &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; containing mitochondrion-targeting butyltriphenylphosphonium cationic species was also prepared. It selectively localized in mitochondria of HeLa cells, with low cytotoxicity and intense deep red fluorescence emission.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Observation of Charge, Energy, and Hydrogen Transfer between the Backbone and Nucleobases in Isolated DNA Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorus atoms were targeted in the backbone of gas&#8208;phase oligonucleotide anions and cations, by means of resonant photoabsorption at the L&#8208; and K&#8208;edges. The ionic photoproducts of the excitation process were studied by a combination of mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray spectroscopy. Charge and/or energy as well as H transfer from the backbone to nucleobases was directly observed and investigated.







Abstract
Understanding how charge and energy, as well as protons and hydrogen atoms, are transferred in molecular systems as a result of an electronic excitation is fundamental for understanding the interaction between ionizing radiation and biological matter on the molecular level. To localize the excitation at the atomic scale, it was chosen to target phosphorus atoms in the backbone of gas&#8208;phase oligonucleotide anions and cations, by means of resonant photoabsorption at the L&#8208; and K&#8208;edges. The ionic photoproducts of the excitation process were studied by a combination of mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray spectroscopy. The combination of absorption site selectivity and photoproduct sensitivity allowed the identification of X&#8208;ray spectral signatures of specific processes. Moreover, charge and/or energy as well as H transfer from the backbone to nucleobases has been directly observed. Although the probability of one versus two H transfer following valence ionization depends on the nucleobase, ionization of sugar or phosphate groups at the carbon K&#8208;edge or the phosphorus L&#8208;edge mainly leads to single H transfer to protonated adenine. Moreover, our results indicate a surprising proton&#8208;transfer process to specifically form protonated guanine after excitation or ionization of P 2p electrons.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Piezochromism from o&#8208;Carborane Dyad: Boron&#8208;Clusters Facilitating Wide&#8208;Range Redshift and High Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piezochromic materials, which exhibit a fluorescence response with large emission spectral shifts and high sensitivity, may be useful in important applications, but there have been few reports of such organic luminophores. Herein, we report a new high&#8208;sensitivity piezochromic material based on the incorporation of an o&#8208;carborane unit, which exhibits aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties. In a high&#8208;pressure experiment, compared to carborane&#8208;free MTY, which exhibits an emission spectral shift of 75 nm and a sensitivity of 19.1 nm&#8226;GPa&#8208;1, the o&#8208;carborane dyad MTCb shows a larger emission wavelength difference of 131 nm and a higher sensitivity of 32.8 nm&#8226;GPa&#8208;1, demonstrating a performance that ranks among the best of organic piezochromic materials reported thus far. MTCb molecules adopt a J&#8208;aggregated pattern and have relatively loose molecular packing in the crystalline state. Interestingly, nonconjugated spherical carborane can disrupt the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between adjacent molecules during compression, which results in excellent piezochromic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Helicene&#8208;Containing Arenes for Optical Limiting Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A helicene&#8208;containing arene and its linear analogue have been successfully synthesized and characterized, where the single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicates that the former can arrange in an offset packing style with a &#960;&#8208;&#960; overlap. The introduction of pentagon&#8208;rings into the parent skeletons in the resulting compounds can boost the stability, and such helicene&#8208;containing molecule possesses higher solubility in organic solvent than the linear analogue. The structural difference has significantly influenced the optical limiting performance. The former in solution and in doped gel glass presents higher optical limiting response towards 532 nm laser than the latter. This study can enrich the functionalization of helicene, which can possess a positive effect in terms of nonlinear optical property.</dc:description>

Owing to the planar conjugated structures of the hexaphenyltriphenylene skeleton, such metallacages show good host&#8722;guest complexation with a series of emissive dyes,&#160; which have been further used to tune their emission in solution. Interestingly, based on their complementary emission colors, white light emission is achieved in a mixture of the host metallacages and the guests.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermally Activated vs. Photochemical Hydrogen Evolution Reactions &#8211; a Tale of Three Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular processes behind hydrogen evolution reactions can be quite complex. In macroscopic electrochemical cells, it is extremely difficult to elucidate and understand their mechanism. Gas phase models, consisting of a metal ion and a small number of water molecules, provide unique opportunities to understand the reaction pathways in great detail. Hydrogen evolution in clusters consisting of a singly charged metal ion and one to on the order of 50 water molecules has been studied extensively for magnesium, aluminum and vanadium. Such clusters with around 10&#8211;20 water molecules are known to eliminate atomic or molecular hydrogen upon mild activation by room temperature black&#8208;body radiation. Irradiation with ultraviolet light, however, enables hydrogen evolution already with a single water molecule. Here, we analyze and compare the reaction mechanisms for hydrogen evolution on the ground state as well as excited state potential energy surfaces. Five distinct mechanisms for evolution of atomic or molecular hydrogen are identified and characterized.</dc:description>

         <title>Selectivity in Cationic Cyclizations Involving Alkynes: a Computational Study on Biomimetic Synthesis of Steroids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Computational studies on the electrophilic cyclization between alkynes and transient carbocations or Lewis acid activated epoxides show that the regiochemistry of the reaction depends on the terminal or internal position of the triple bond. Reactants possessing terminal alkynyl groups lead to six&#8208;membered rings whereas internal alkynes yield five&#8208;membered rings via 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig and 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig electrophilic cyclizations, respectively. The regiochemistry of the reaction is not determined by two&#8208;electron interactions, but by minimization of Pauli repulsion. This scenario is preserved in related biomimetic reactions leading to steroid scaffolds. In this latter case, the stereochemistry of the cyclization reaction is oriented towards the formation of equatorial C&#8208;C bonds connecting the new six&#8208;six&#8208; and six&#8208;five&#8208;membered fused rings.</dc:description>

         <title>Crown Ether&#8208;Based Ion Transporters in Bilayer Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bilayer membranes that enhance the stability of the cell are essential for cell survival, separating and protecting the interior of the cell from its external environment. Membrane&#8208;based channel proteins are crucial for sustaining cellular activities. However, dysfunction of these proteins would induce serial channelopathies, which could be substituted by artificial ion channel analogs. Crown ethers (CEs) are widely studied in the area of artificial ion channels owing to their intrinsic host&#8208;guest interaction with different kinds of organic and inorganic ions. Other advantages such as lower price, chemical stability, and easier modification also make CE a research hotspot in the field of synthetic transmembrane nanopores. And numerous CEs&#8208;based membrane&#8208;active synthetic ion channels were designed and fabricated in the past decades. Herein, the recent progress of CEs&#8208;based synthetic ion transporters has been comprehensively summarized in this review, including their design principles, functional mechanisms, controllable properties, and biomedical applications. Furthermore, this review has been concluded by discussing the future opportunities and challenges facing this research field. It is anticipated that this review could offer some inspiration for the future fabrication of novel CEs&#8208;derived ion transporters with more advanced structures, properties, and practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Theoretical calculations on metal catalysts toward water&#8208;gas shift reaction: a review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;gas shift (WGS) reaction offers a dominating path to hydrogen generation from fossil fuel, in which heterogeneous metal catalysts play a crucial part in this course. In this review, we highlighted and summarized recent developments on theoretical calculations of metal catalysts developed to date, including surface structure (e.g., monometallic and polymetallic systems) and interface structure (e.g., supported catalysts and metal oxide composites), with special emphasis on the characteristics of crystal&#8208;face effect, alloying strategy, and metal&#8208;support interaction. A systematic summarization on reaction mechanism was performed, including redox mechanism, associative mechanism as well as hybrid mechanism; the development on chemical kinetics (e.g., molecular dynamics, kinetic Monte Carlo and microkinetic simulation) was then introduced. At the end, we discussed the challenges associated with theoretical calculations on metal catalysts toward WGS reaction and provided some perspectives on the future advance of this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Live Monitoring of Anionic Living Polymerizations by Electrospray&#8208;Ionization Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perusing polymerization: Electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry permits the in&#8208;situ monitoring of living anionic polymerizations. Analysis of the time evolution of the observed molar mass distributions affords rate constants for the individual propagation steps and gives unique insight into the mechanism of the polymerization reaction.







Abstract
Anionic polymerizations are of exceptional practical importance, but difficult to analyze due to the high reactivity of the growing polymer chains. Here, we demonstrate that electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) permits direct observation of the active carbanionic intermediates formed in the anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization of 1&#8208;cyanocyclopropanecarboxylate in tetrahydrofuran. This includes the identification of a side product, as well as real&#8208;time analysis of the polymerization reaction. From the mass spectra obtained, we can derive not only the mean molar mass and the polydispersity, but also the rate constants for the initiation and the individual propagation steps. The initiation proceeds significantly faster than the propagation steps. Accordingly, the examined reaction corresponds to a living polymerization, as we also confirmed by additional control experiments. Besides giving detailed insight into the reaction system probed here, we also expect the presented methodology to make possible the in&#8208;situ analysis of further anionic polymerizations.

         <title>IR/UV Double Resonance Study of the 2&#8208;Phenylallyl Radical and its Pyrolysis Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The contribution of the resonance&#8208;stabilized 2&#8208;phenylallyl radical (2&#8208;PA) to molecular growth in a high temperature microreactor is reported in this work. The radical as well as several reaction products were identified by IR/UV ion dip spectroscopy based on their gas&#8208;phase IR signatures, showing that uni&#8208; and bimolecular reactions of 2&#8208;PA are a viable source for PAH formation.







Abstract
Isolated 2&#8208;phenylallyl radicals (2&#8208;PA), generated by pyrolysis from a nitrite precursor, have been investigated by IR/UV ion dip spectroscopy using free electron laser radiation. 2&#8208;PA is a resonance&#8208;stabilized radical that is considered to be involved in the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in combustion, but also in interstellar space. The radical is identified based on its gas&#8208;phase IR spectrum. Furthermore, a number of bimolecular reaction products are identified, showing that the self&#8208;reaction as well as reactions with unimolecular decomposition products of 2&#8208;PA form several PAH efficiently. Possible mechanisms are discussed and the chemistry of 2&#8208;PA is compared with the one of the related 2&#8208;methylallyl and phenylpropargyl radicals.

         <title>A Modular Olefination of Aldehydes with Thiols as Coupling Partners</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and modular protocol for the olefination of aldehydes with thiols as reaction partners is reported. Olefins with both aromatic and aliphatic substituents were synthesized in high yields and good selectivity via unsymmetric bissulfone intermediates. The E/Z&#8208;selectivity could be switched under kinetic control through the choice of solvent. The use of simple, transition metal&#8208;free reaction conditions and the breadth of substitution patterns that can be accessed render this protocol an attractive addition to the methods available for the de&#8208;novo synthesis of olefins.







Abstract
Olefins range amongst the most important motifs in organic chemistry. Hence, the development of novel olefin syntheses has remained a constant field of research in synthetic chemistry to date. Herein, we report the development of a modular olefination that converts aldehydes into olefins with thiols as reaction partners. The simple, transition metal&#8208;free protocol proceeds via an unsymmetrical bissulfone intermediate which is converted into the respective alkene in a Ramberg&#8208;B&#228;cklund&#8208;type process. Differently substituted olefins can be synthesized from readily available starting materials in typically good yields and stereoselectivities using basic laboratory chemicals exclusively. Complementary reaction conditions differing in the choice of solvent favor the E/Z&#8208;products respectively under kinetic control rendering this protocol an interesting economical addition to the family of olefin syntheses.

The &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-selectivity could be switched under kinetic control through the choice of solvent. The use of simple, transition metal-free reaction conditions and the breadth of substitution patterns that can be accessed render this protocol an attractive addition to the methods available for the de-novo synthesis of olefins.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olefins range amongst the most important motifs in organic chemistry. Hence, the development of novel olefin syntheses has remained a constant field of research in synthetic chemistry to date. Herein, we report the development of a modular olefination that converts aldehydes into olefins with thiols as reaction partners. The simple, transition metal-free protocol proceeds via an unsymmetrical bissulfone intermediate which is converted into the respective alkene in a Ramberg-B&#228;cklund-type process. Differently substituted olefins can be synthesized from readily available starting materials in typically good yields and stereoselectivities using basic laboratory chemicals exclusively. Complementary reaction conditions differing in the choice of solvent favor the &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-products respectively under kinetic control rendering this protocol an interesting economical addition to the family of olefin syntheses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>POM@ZIF Derived Mixed Metal Oxide Catalysts for Sustained Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile chemical route to convert POM&#8208;doped ZIF 67 to carbon&#8208;supported mixed metal oxides gives access to a noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free OER catalyst featuring high specific surface area, high stability, and high OER activity.







Abstract
The design of efficient and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts based on noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free materials is crucial for energy conversion and storage. In this work, it was demonstrated how polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67 can be converted into a stable oxygen evolution electrocatalyst by chemical etching, cation exchange, and thermal annealing steps. Characterization by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy indicate that POM&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67 derived carbon&#8208;supported metal oxides were synthesized. The resulting composite shows structural and compositional advantages which lead to low overpotential (306&#8197;mV at j=10&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and long&#8208;term stability under harsh OER conditions (1.0&#8197;M aqueous KOH).

         <title>Preparation, Structure&#8208;Performance Relationship, and Reaction Network of ZnZSM&#8208;5 for Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane with CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethylene (C2H4) is a major chemical for the modern society, and new technologies for its production are of strategic importance globally. Recently, oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (C2H6) using CO2 as a milder oxidant (CO2&#8208;ODH) is proposed as a potential way for C2H4 production, and development of effective catalysts for the process is drawing wide attentions. Here, we report on a facilely prepared ZSM&#8208;5 supported Zn system, i.e. ZnZSM&#8208;5, which showed great promise in CO2&#8208;ODH. Samples with different Zn loadings were prepared and evaluated, and the highest performance was obtained over 0.05ZnZSM&#8208;5 at 700 oC and a CO2:C2H6 feeding ratio of 5:1. During 340 min TOS, the C2H6 conversion decreased moderately from 36.2 to 23.1%, and the C2H4 yield stabilized at 21.9 to 27.9%. Based on systematic characterization and investigation of reaction conditions, the structure&#8208;performance relationship and reaction network were discussed in detail.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In the past decade, compounds bearing a stereogenic C&#8211; N axis have gained significant attention ranging from ligand to drug design. Yet, the atroposelective synthesis of these molecules remains a considerable challenge. In contrast to recent methods utilizing more advanced chiral catalysts, a most simply accessed Jacobsen&#8208;type Chromium(III)&#8208;salen complex was herein utilized as chiral enantiopure Lewis acid catalyst for a highly atroposelective Nenitzescu indole synthesis. Mild reaction conditions afforded various 5&#8208;Hydroxybenzo[g]indoles with up to 97% yield. Moreover, through a simple work&#8208;up, very high enantiomeric excesses of up to 99% could be obtained.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A de novo designed class of peptide&#8208;based fluoropolymers composed of fluorinated aliphatic amino acids as main components is reported. Structural characterization provided insights into fluorine&#8208;induced alterations on &#946;&#8208;strand to &#945;&#8208;helix transition upon an increase in SDS content and revealed the unique formation of PPII structures for trifluorinated fluoropeptides. A combination of circular dichroism, fluorescence&#8208;based leaking assays and surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy served to examine the insertion and folding processes into unilamellar vesicles. While partitioning into lipid bilayers, the degree of fluorination conducts a decrease in &#945;&#8208;helical content. Furthermore, this study comprises a report on the proteolytic stability of peptides exclusively built up by fluorinated amino acids and proved all sequences to be enzymatically degradable despite the degree of fluorination.

         <title>Ketyl Radicals Generated from Magnesium(I) Compounds: Useful Reagents for C&#8210;C Bond Forming Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aryl ketones, 9&#8208;fluorenone (fluor), 9&#8208;xanthenone (xanth) and 9,10&#8208;anthraquinone (anth), were reacted with &#946;&#8208;diketiminato dimagnesium(I) compounds, [{(ArNacnac)Mg}2] (ArNacnac = [HC(MeCNAr)2]&#8208;, Ar = mesityl (Mes) or 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl (Dip)). This gave stable magnesium ketyl complexes which are monomeric, [(ArNacnac)(DMAP)Mg(fluor&#183;)] (Ar = Mes or Dip, DMAP = 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine) and [(MesNacnac)Mg(xanth&#183;)(xanth)]; dimeric, [{(MesNacnac)Mg(&#956;&#8208;fluor&#183;)}2], or tetrameric, [{(DipNacnac)Mg(&#956;&#8208;anth&#183;)}4]. In contrast, di&#8208;2&#8208;pyridylketone (OCPy2) is doubly reduced with [{(XylNacnac)Mg}2] (Xyl = xylyl) to give a diamagnetic alkoxy/amido complex, [{(XylNacnac)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;OCPy2)]. These complexes have been characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, and in three cases, EPR spectroscopy. Regioselective C&#8210;C hetero&#8208;coupling reactions between magnesium ketyls and phenanthroline (phen) have yielded the alkoxy compounds, [(MesNacnac)Mg(OCR2&#8208;2&#8208;phen)] (OCR2 = xanth, OCPh2 or OC(Ph)(2&#8208;Me&#8208;Ph)). In addition, homo&#8208; C&#8208;C couplings of the enones, chalcone (chalc) and dibenziylideneactetone (DBA), using magnesium(I) reducing agents, have afforded dimagnesium enolates, [{(ArNacnac)(THF)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;chalc2)] (Ar = Mes or Xyl) and [{(DipNacnac)(THF)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;DBA2)]. A pinacol coupling reaction between [{(DipNacnac)Mg}2] and 2&#8208;adamantanone (OAd) yielded [{(DipNacnac)(OAd)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;OAd2)], presumably via a ketyl intermediate. This study further highlights the utility magnesium(I) compounds have as selective reducing agents in organic transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Fluorescent Supramolecular Nanoring Composed of Bent&#8208;Shaped Cyanostilbene Derivatives and Cucurbit[8]urils</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) made of organic guest molecule and cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) in aqueous solution have great potential for diverse applications. Herein, we designed highly fluorescent zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) nano&#8208;ring SOF with CB[8] as a host and novel bent&#8208;shaped cyanostilbene guest. This host&#8208;guest complex successfully formed macrocyclic hexamer and showed significantly enhanced fluorescence (&#934;F = 68%) compared to non&#8208;assembled monomer (&#934;F = 2%). Unlike other SOFs, this 0D SOF could be dispersed uniformly without bundling phenomenon in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating the Antifreeze Activity through Water: Latent Functions of Sugars of Antifreeze Glycoprotein Revealed by Using Total Chemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antifreeze glycoprotein (AFGP), which inhibits the freezing of water, is highly O&#8208;glycosylated with a disaccharide,&#160;D&#8208;Gal&#946;1&#8208;3&#8208;D&#8208;GalNAc&#945; (GalGalNAc). To elucidate the function of the sugar residues for antifreeze activity at the molecular level, we conducted a total chemical synthesis of partially sugar deleted AFGP derivatives, and&#160;unnatural forms of&#160;AFGPs incorporating glucose (Glc)&#8208;type sugars instead of galactose (Gal)&#8208;type sugars. These elaborated AFGP derivatives demonstrated that the stereochemistry of each sugar residues on AFGPs precisely correlates with the antifreeze activity. A hydrogen&#8211;deuterium exchange experiment using synthetic AFGPs revealed a different dynamic behaviour of water around sugar residues depending on the sugar structures. These results indicate that sugar residues on AFGP form a unique dynamic water phase that disturbs the absorbance of water molecules onto the ice surface, thereby inhibiting freezing.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimerized Nitrogen&#8208;Annulated Perylene Synthesized from 1,6&#8208;Diazecine as Chiral Emitter</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

Owing to the substructure of 1,6&#8208;diazecine ten&#8208;membered ring,&#160;DNP&#8208;DAillustrates helical chirality with moderate dissymmetry factor, elevated molecular levels, expanded conjugation and supramolecular interactions with acceptors etc.&#160;Notably,&#160;DNP&#8208;DA&#160;represents a limited example of nitrogen&#8208;perylene&#160;based CPL emitter with glum&#160;around 6 &#215; 10&#8722;3. Intrigued by the facile fabrication via a simple amination&#8208;cross coupling sequence and other above advancing features, this work demonstrates the potential generality of utilizing 1,6&#8208;diazecine as a chiral unit to build CPL&#8208;active&#160;materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Simple Four&#8208;Step Synthesis of the Potato Alkaloid Demissidine from the Common Sapogenin Tigogenin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple synthesis method of solanidane alkaloids from common steroidal sapogenins was developed. Previously described multi&#8208;step transformations of tigogenin to demissidine (8&#8209;12 steps) were shortened to four steps only. The key&#8208;step of the present synthesis was the epimerization at C25 of the lactam intermediate. Different approaches to this reaction, i.e., a classical one via enolate, and a chemoselective umpolung transformation, were thoroughly investigated. The epimerization step is unnecessary if the starting sapogenin has the same configuration at C25 as the target alkaloid because the configuration at C25 (either R or S) remains intact throughout the synthesis. Thus, the related solanidane alkaloids, 12&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;25&#8208;epi&#8208;demissidine and 5&#8208;epi&#8208;demissidine, were synthesized in the three&#8208;step procedure with retention of configuration at this stereogenic center from rockogenin (25R&#8208;5&#945;&#8208;sapogenin) or sarsasapogenin (25S&#8208;5&#946;&#8208;sapogenin), respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ X&#8208;ray Diffraction Studies on the Reduction of V2O5 and WO3 using Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reduction of metal oxides with hydrogen is widely used for the production of fine chemicals and metals both at laboratory and industry scale. In situ methods can help to elucidate reaction pathways and to gain control over such synthesis reactions. In this study, the reduction of WO3 and V2O5 with hydrogen has been investigated with in situ X&#8208;ray powder diffraction with regard to intermediates and influences of heating rates and hydrogen flow rates. Mixtures of V4O9, V6O13 as well as VO2 in two modifications are identified as intermediates on the way to phase pure V2O3. None of the intermediates are encountered isolated and can therefore not be prepared this way. In contrast, the intermediates of the WO3 reduction, H0.23WO3 and W10O29, appear consecutively and can be isolated. For both reactions, heating rate and flow rate have little influence on the formation of intermediates.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;emissive photoconvertible fluorophores (DPCFs) are powerful tools in bioimaging to unambiguously track labelled cells in bioimaging. We recently introduced a new rational mechanism called directed photooxidation induced conversion (DPIC) enabling to obtain efficient DPCFs by conjugating a coumarin to aromatic singlet oxygen reactive moieties (ASORMs). Pyrrole was found to be a suitable ASORM as it provided a high hypsochromic shift along with a fast and efficient conversion. By synthesizing various pyrrole&#8208;based styryl coumarin dyes, we herein show that the photoconversion properties, including the quantum yield of photoconversion and the chemical yield of conversion can be tuned by chemical modification of the pyrrole. These modifications led to an improved dual emissive converter, SCP&#8208;Boc, which displayed a high brightness and an enhanced photoconversion yield of 63%. SCP&#8208;Boc was successfully used to sequentially photoconvert cells by laser scanning confocal microscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Carbon&#8208;Boron Bond Formation via Heterogeneous Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroboration of Enallenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly efficient regio&#8208; and stereoselective heterogeneous palladium&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration reaction of enallenes was developed. &#160;Nanopalladium immobilized on microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) was success&#173;fully employed as an efficient catalyst for the enallene hydro&#173;boration reaction. The nanopalladium particles were shown by HAADF&#8208;STEM to have an average size of 2.4 nm. &#160;The cellulose&#8208;supported palladium catalyst exhibits high stability and provides vinyl boron products in good to high isolated yields (up to 90%). The nanopalladium catalyst can be efficiently recycled and it was demonstrated that the catalyst ca be used in 7 runs with a maintained high yield (&gt;80%). The vinylboron compounds prepared from enallenes are important synthetic intermediates that can be used in various organic synthetic transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Principle for Complex Disordered Tetrahedral Frameworks in Quenched High&#8208;pressure Phases of Phosphorus Oxide Nitrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The crystal structures of the new phosphorus oxide nitrides P40O31N46 and P74O59N84, which were synthesized from amorphous phosphorus oxide nitride imide, exhibit complex frameworks built up from P(O,N)4 tetrahedra. The latter form various chain&#8208;like building units of various branchedness. These modular units can be combined and arranged in different ways, which leads to closely related structures and several disordered configurations in each compound. As the material was obtained by high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature synthesis, the disorder is most likely a consequence of quenching a high&#8208;pressure phase with P(O,N)5 trigonal bipyramids. Under ambient conditions, P atoms are expected to relax by moving to the centers of the face&#8208;sharing tetrahedra that constitute the bipyramid. Diffraction patterns acquired with microfocused synchrotron radiation reveal that domains of both compounds are intergrown with H3P8O8N9, whose tetrahedral framework represents a cutout of the structures of both P40O31N46 and P74O59N84. Powder diffraction patterns do not indicate any further phases.</dc:description>

         <title>AAZTA&#8208;like ligands bearing phenolate arms as efficient chelators for 68Ga labelling in vitro and in vivo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of a phenolate pendant arm in place of an acetate on AAZTA&#8208; and DATA&#8208;like ligands resulted in hepta&#8208; and hexadentate chelators able to form Ga(III) complexes with thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness higher than that of other Ga(III) complexes based on the parent 6&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;methylperhydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazepine scaffold. In particular, the heptadentate AAZ3A&#8208;endoHB with a phenolate arm on an endocyclic N&#8208;atom shows a logKGaL of 27.35 and a remarkable resistance to hydroxide coordination up to basic pH (pH &gt; 9). This behaviour allows to also improve the kinetic inertness of the complex showing a dissociation half&#8208;life (t&#189;) at pH 7.4 of 76 h. Although also the hexadentate AAZ2A&#8208;exoHB chelator forms a stable (logKGaL = 24.69) and inert (t&#189; = 33 h at pH 7.4) Ga(III) complex, the 68Ga labelling showed a better radiochemical yield with AAZ3A&#8208;endoHB, especially at room temperature. Thus, a bifunctional chelator of AAZ3A&#8208;endoHB was synthesized bearing an isothiocyanate group that was conjugated to the N&#8208;terminus of a c(RGD) peptide for integrin receptor targeting. Finally, the conjugate was successfully labelled with 68Ga isotope, and the resulting radiotracer tested for its stability in human serum and then in vivo for targeting B16&#8208;F10 tumours with miniPET imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Quest for a Rational Molecular Design of Alkyl&#8211;Distyrylbenzene Liquid by Substitution Pattern Modulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkyl&#8208;&#960; functional molecular liquids (FMLs) are of interest for fabricating soft electronic devices due to their fluidic nature and innate optoelectronic functions from the &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety. However, predictable development of alkyl&#8208;&#960; FMLs with the desired liquid and optoelectronic properties is challenging. A series of alkyl&#8211;distyrylbenzene (DSB) liquids was studied in terms of the substituent position effect by attaching 2&#8208;octyldodecyl chains at (2,4&#8208;), (2,5&#8208;), (2,6&#8208;), and (3,5&#8208;). The effect of the alkyl chain length was investigated by attaching 2&#8208;hexyldecyl, 2&#8208;decyltetradecyl (C10C14), and 2&#8208;dodecylhexadecyl at the (2,5&#8208;) substituent position. The 2,5C10C14 substituent pattern constructed a superior alkyl&#8211;DSB liquid with a lower viscosity, intrinsic optical properties, and high thermal&#8208; and photo&#8208;stabilities. The discovered 2,5&#8208;C10C14 was applied to dicyanostyrylbenzene and comparable liquid physical and optical superiorities were confirmed. This molecular design is useful for creating alkyl&#8208;&#960; FMLs with the aforementioned advantages, which are applicable for deformable and flowable optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoreactivity Driven by Excited State Aromaticity Gain or Antiaromaticity Relief</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gain of aromaticity or relief of antiaromaticity along a reaction path are important factors to consider in mechanism studies. Analysis of such changes along potential energy surfaces has historically focused on reactions in the electronic ground state (S0) but can also be utilized for excited states. In the lowest &#960;&#960;* states the electron counts for aromaticity and antiaromaticity follow Baird&#8217;s rule where 4n &#960;&#8208;electrons indicate aromaticity and 4n+2 &#960;&#8208;electrons antiaromaticity. Yet, there are also cases where H&#252;ckel&#8217;s rule plays a role in the excited state. The electron count reversals of Baird&#8217;s rule compared to H&#252;ckel&#8217;s rule explain many altered physicochemical properties upon excitation of (hetero)annulene derivatives. Here we illustrate how gain of excited state aromaticity (ESA) and relief of excited state antiaromaticity (ESAA) impact on photoreactivity and photostability. Emphasis is placed on recent findings supported by results of quantum chemical calculations, and photoreactions in a wide variety of areas are covered.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanoresponsive Metal&#8208;Organic Cage&#8208;Crosslinked Polymer Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the formation of metal&#8208;organic cage&#8208;crosslinked polymer hydrogels. To enable crosslinking of the cages and subsequent network formation, we used homodifunctionalized poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains terminally substituted with bipyridines as ligands for the Pd6L4 corners. The encapsulation of guest molecules into supramolecular self&#8208;assembled metal&#8208;organic cage&#8208;crosslinked hydrogels, as well as ultrasound&#8208;induced disassembly of the cages with release of their cargo, is presented in addition to their characterization by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques, rheology, and comprehensive small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) experiments. The constrained geometries simulating external force (CoGEF) method and barriers using a force&#8208;modified potential energy surface (FMPES) suggest that the cage&#8208;opening mechanism starts with the dissociation of one pyridine ligand at around 0.5 nN. We show the efficient sonochemical activation of the hydrogels HG1&#8208;6, increasing the non&#8208;covalent guest&#8208;loading of completely unmodified drugs available for release by a factor of ten in comparison to non&#8208;crosslinked, star&#8208;shaped assemblies in solution.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We report the formation of metal-organic cage-crosslinked polymer hydrogels. To enable crosslinking of the cages and subsequent network formation, we used homodifunctionalized poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains terminally substituted with bipyridines as ligands for the Pd6L4 corners. The encapsulation of guest molecules into supramolecular self-assembled metal-organic cage-crosslinked hydrogels, as well as ultrasound-induced disassembly of the cages with release of their cargo, is presented in addition to their characterization by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques, rheology, and comprehensive small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments. The constrained geometries simulating external force (CoGEF) method and barriers using a force-modified potential energy surface (FMPES) suggest that the cage-opening mechanism starts with the dissociation of one pyridine ligand at around 0.5 nN. We show the efficient sonochemical activation of the hydrogels HG1-6, increasing the non-covalent guest-loading of completely unmodified drugs available for release by a factor of ten in comparison to non-crosslinked, star-shaped assemblies in solution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Alkoxyphosphorane /Borane Cooperative alkylations: A Frustrated Lewis Pair Version of the Mitsunobu Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of the alkoxyphosphoranes, Ph2P(OR)(O2C6Cl4) and the borane B(C6F5)3 generates the zwitterions 3 which act as FLP to effect the alkylation of several nucleophiles affording C&#8208;C, C&#8208;N, C&#8208;H and C&#8208;Cl coupling products. A DFT study shows the reaction proceeds via an FLP activation pathway generating an alkoxyphosphonium intermediate which effects the alkylation of the nucleophiles, akin to the Mitsunobu reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Construction of N&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons with Indole as the&#160;Nitrogen Source Building Block</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An Ag/Au catalyzed divergent cascade reaction of alkyne embedded diazoketones with indoles has been described. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction goes through a [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of an in situ formed isobenzopyrylium intermediate with indole, followed by a sequential retro&#8208;Michael addition/carbene N&#8208;H insertion process to give the benzo[i]phenanthridines products with gold catalysis; whereas a dearomatization/rearomatization sequence occurs favourably when the reaction is catalyzed by a silver catalyst, delivering benzo[b]carbazoles in generally high to excellent yields. Notably, this is a rare example of using indole as the dienophile for cycloaddition with the isobenzopyrylium species, providing a concise and practical approach for the selective construction of N&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with structural diversity and broad functional group compatibility.</dc:description>
