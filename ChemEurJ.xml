      <title>Tertiary&#8208;Amine&#8208;Initiated Synthesis of Acyl Fluorides from Carboxylic Acids and CF3SO2OCF3</title>
      <dc:description>A convenient method for deoxyfluorination of aromatic and aliphatic carboxylic acids with CF3SO2OCF3  in the presence of a suitable base at room temperature has been developed. The reaction allows a straightforward access to a variety of acyl fluorides and proves that CF3SO2OCF3  &#160;is an effective deoxyfluorination reagent for carboxylic acids. The method features simplicity, expeditiousness, high efficiency, ease of handling, good functional group tolerance, a wide range of substrates, excellent yields of products, compatibility of many amine initiators, use of environmentally friendly reagents, and effortless removal of byproducts.

      <title>Evaluation of Pd&#8594;B Interactions in Diphosphinoborane Complexes and Impact on Inner&#8208;Sphere Reductive Elimination</title>
      <dc:description>
Ligand effects: The borane acceptor in diphosphinoborane ligands discriminates between the oxidation state PdII and Pd0, stabilizing the latter. The impact of the Pd&#8594;B interaction on inner&#8208;sphere C&#8722;N bond reductive elimination of N,N&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;nitroaniline was investigated (see scheme).







Abstract
The dative Pd&#8594;B interaction in a series of RDPBR&#8217; Pd0 and PdII complexes (RDPBR&#8217;=(o&#8208;PR2C6H4)2BR&#8217;, diphosphinoborane) was analyzed using XRD, 11B&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and NBO/NLMO calculations. The borane acceptor discriminates between the oxidation state PdII and Pd0, stabilizing the latter. Reaction of lithium amides with [(RDPBR&#8217;)PdII(4&#8208;NO2C6H4)I] chemoselectively yields the C&#8722;N coupling product. DFT modelling indicates no significant impact of PdII&#8594;B coordination on the inner&#8208;sphere reductive elimination rate.

      <dc:description>
The tetrakis(pentafluoroethyl)aluminate rises from the once hidden class of perfluoroalkyl aluminum compounds and flourishes in all its beauty. Perfluorinated aryl, aryloxy and alkoxy aluminum species are well&#8208;established but the corresponding perfluoroalkyl aluminum derivatives are virtually unknown. A convenient synthesis of several [Al(C2F5)4]&#8722; salts was developed by the reaction of Li[AlH4] with Si(C2F5)3CH3 and a subsequent cation exchange. However, the [NBu4]+ and [PPh4]+ salts decompose at room temperature. Utilizing a weakly coordinating phosphazenium cation enhances the thermal stability, yielding [{(Et2N)3P=N}3P=N(H)tBu][Al(C2F5)4] as a stable solid.

      <title>Prebiotic Nucleoside Synthesis: The Selectivity of Simplicity</title>
      <dc:description>
Unlocking life's mysteries: Achievements in the field of prebiotic RNA and DNA nucleoside and nucleotide synthesis are highlighted under consideration of plausible reaction conditions, starting from simple building blocks.







Abstract
Ever since the discovery of nucleic acids 150&#8197;years ago, major achievements have been made in understanding and decrypting the fascinating scientific questions of the genetic code. However, the most fundamental question about the origin and the evolution of the genetic code remains a mystery. How did nature manage to build up such intriguingly complex molecules able to encode structure and function from simple building blocks? What conditions were required? How could the precursors survive the unhostile environment of early Earth? Over the past decades, promising synthetic concepts were proposed providing clarity in the field of prebiotic nucleic acid research. In this Minireview, we show the current status and various approaches to answer these fascinating questions.

      <dc:description>
Turn the light on: Supramolecular materials with reversible photo&#8208;switchable fluorescence were obtained by combining 4&#8208;alkoxystilbazoles with hydroxy benzoic acids. Using the photobasicity/acidity of the assemblies lead to fluorescent materials upon irradiation in the mesophase







Abstract
A series of hydrogen&#8208;bonded liquid crystals showing switchable fluorescence is reported. The fluorescence behavior results from the unique combination of hydrogen bonding, liquid crystallinity, and photobasicity. Thus, the molecular mobility in the mesophase is essential for the reversible photo&#8208;initiated proton transfer switching on the fluorescence of the assemblies. The application potential of the materials for photo&#8208;patterning was demonstrated.

      <title>Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Synthesis of S. mansoni O&#8208;Glycans and Their Evaluation as Ligands for C&#8208;Type Lectin Receptors MGL, DC&#8208;SIGN, and DC&#8208;SIGNR</title>
      <dc:description>
A series of parasite O&#8208;glycans structures have been prepared by chemoenzymatic synthesis and their affinity towards several C&#8208;type lectins screened using glycan arrays.







Abstract
Due to their interactions with C&#8208;type lectin receptors (CLRs), glycans from the helminth Schistosoma mansoni represent promising leads for treatment of autoimmune diseases, allergies or cancer. We chemo&#8208;enzymatically synthesized nine O&#8208;glycans based on the two predominant O&#8208;glycan cores observed in the infectious stages of schistosomiasis, the mucin core 2 and the S. mansoni core. The O&#8208;glycans were fucosylated next to a selection of N&#8208;glycans directly on a microarray slide using a recombinant fucosyltransferase and GDP&#8208;fucose or GDP&#8208;6&#8208;azidofucose as donor. Binding assays with fluorescently labelled human CLRs DC&#8208;SIGN, DC&#8208;SIGNR and MGL revealed the novel O&#8208;glycan O8 as the best ligand for MGL from our panel. Significant binding to DC&#8208;SIGN was also found for azido&#8208;fucosylated glycans. Contrasting binding specificities were observed between the monovalent carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and the tetravalent extracellular domain (ECD) of DC&#8208;SIGNR.

      <dc:description>
Organic room temperature phosphorescence is closely related to the intermolecular interactions, because such interactions are beneficial to promote spin orbital coupling (SOC) and boost intersystem cross (ISC) efficiency and finally are conducive to satisfactory phosphorescence. It is found that the intermolecular interactions, which are essential for organic phosphorescence, are easily disturbed by external stimuli such as mechanical force, photon, acid, chemical vapor, leading to the luminescence change.

      <title>Frontispiece: Matrix Effects in a Fluid Catalytic Cracking Catalyst Particle: Influence on Structure, Acidity, and Accessibility</title>
      <dc:description>
Hydrocarbon cracking is an important process to make fuels and chemicals. Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalysts are capable of doing this and are complex materials. They consist of a matrix (alumina, silica and clay) and an active component, a zeolite. Efficient cracking requires not only that there are a sufficient number of active sites, but also that these sites are accessible for the hydrocarbons. In this work, Velthoen and co&#8208;workers explore different cooking recipes to assess the influence of Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acidity, as well as their accessibility and structure on FCC performance. For more information, see the Full Paper on page&#8197;11995&#8197;ff.

      <title>Persistent Radical Pairs between N&#8208;Substituted Naphthalimide and Carbanion Exhibit pKa&#8208;Dependent UV/Vis Absorption
</title>
      <dc:description>
Fast screening of pKa: The UV/Vis absorption spectrum of carbanion radical pairs can serve as a tool to screen pKa values of various carbon acids.







Abstract
A new strategy was devised for estimating and screening pKa values among different carbon acids under ambient conditions by using the UV/Vis absorption spectrum of persistent radical pairs (PRPs), which are generated from an N&#8208;substituted naphthalimide (NNI) derivative in the presence of various carbanions in organic solutions. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was used to examine the presence of radicals. Unexpectedly, it was discovered that the UV/Vis spectrum of PRPs reveals a distinct linear relationship between the PRP absorption and the pKa value of a corresponding carbon acid, which is likely due to the energy difference among different RPRs. The finding may offer organic chemists an alternative reference to conduct carbanion&#8208;mediated reactions in various organic solutions.

Intramolecular electron transfer in deprotonated N&#8208;substituted naphthalimides and intermolecular electron transfer from carbanions to 6&#8208;bromo&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;naphthalimide have been claimed to produce persistent, &#8220;EPR&#8208;active&#8221; triplet&#8208;state diradical anions and (anion) radical pairs. In this Correspondence, arguments against this claim are presented and supported.







Abstract
EPR spectroscopic evidence for intramolecular electron transfer in anionic N&#8208;substituted naphthalimides to yield persistent diradical anions and intermolecular electron transfer from a variety of carbanions to 6&#8208;bromo&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;naphthalimide to yield persistent radical&#8211;radical anion pairs was recently claimed in two papers by Zhang et&#8197;al. In this comment, it is shown that the EPR spectra published in both papers do not agree with the proposed triplet&#8208;state species. Rather, the spectra are due to various doublet&#8208;state radicals, deriving from minor side reactions. The misinterpretations invalidate the general conclusions of the papers.

To further accelerate the interface charge transfer, a ternary acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (A1&#8208;D&#8208;A2) molecular junction is established via gradient nitrogen doping into the polymer skeleton. Accordingly, the exciton splitting and interface charge transfer could be promptly liberated because of the strong attracting ability of the two different electron acceptors. Both DFT calculations and photoluminescence spectra elucidate the swift charge transfer at the donor&#8208;acceptor interface. Consequently, the optimum polymer, N3&#8208;CP, undergoes a remarkable photocatalytic property in terms of hydrogen production with AQY405 nm = 26.6% by the rational design of asymmetric molecular junctions on organic semiconductors.</dc:description>

      <title>Push&#8211;Pull Bisnaphthyridylamine Supramolecular Nanoparticles: Polarity&#8208;Induced Aggregation&#8208; and Crystallization&#8208;Induced Emission Enhancement and Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer</title>

Furthermore, a two&#8208;step emission and aggregation process is controllable by varying the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;water ratio. At 2:3 MeOH:H  2  O, crystallization&#8208;induced emission enhancement (CIEE) occurs via formation of an emissive crystal phase, whereas, at 1:9 MeOH:H  2  O, aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) occurs, induced by emissive supramolecular nanoparticles (NPs). For  BNA&#8208;Ph  , the emission quantum yield was 25 times higher in aqueous methanol than that in pure methanol. Despite the high hydrophilicity of  BNA&#8208;X  (  C  log  P  = 6.1&#8722;8.0), the spherical NPs were monodisperse (polydispersity indices &lt; 0.2). Moreover, the emissive NPs exhibited fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) with pyrene; however, for  BNA&#8208;X  bearing the TEMPO radical (  BNA&#8208;BuTEMPO  ), no FRET was observed because of quenching. In particular, the  BNA&#8208;BuTEMPO  NPs have a slow rotational correlation time (1.3 ns), suggesting applications as magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents with large relaxivity.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Monobromo&#8208;, tetrabromo&#8208;, and pentachloro&#8208;corannulene&#160;are subjected to nucleophilic substitution reactions with toluyl selenide and phenyl telluride&#8208;based nucleophiles generated in situ from the corresponding dichalcogenides. In the case of selenium nucleophile, the reaction provides moderate yields (52&#8208;77%) of the targeted corannulene selenoethers. A subsequent oxidation of the rim selenium atoms proceeds smoothly to furnish corannulene seleneoxides in 81&#8208;93% yield. In the case of tellurides, only monosubstitution of the corannulene scaffold could be achieved albeit with concomitant oxidation of the tellerium atom. Unexpectedly, this monotelluroxide derivative of corannulene (RR&#8217;Te=O, R = Ph, R&#8217; = corannulene) is observed to form a linear coordination polymer chain in the crystalline state.

If the unexpected secondary structure is not eliminated, the detector will first detect it and feed back to us, ensuring the accuracy of the subsequent detection results.

      <title>Completely Amine&#8208;free Open Atmospheric Synthesis of High Quality Cesium Lead Bromide (CsPbBr3) Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>Cesium Lead Halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) &#160;have been prominent materials for light emitting diodes (LEDs) and other significant applications in photovoltaic and optoelectronics. The oleylamine which play an important role for surface passivation may also be responsible for poor colloidal stability as a result of facile proton exchange leading to the formation of labile oleylammonium ion halide which pulls out halide ion from NCs surface. In this work, we demonstrated a facile and efficient completely amine&#8208; free synthesis of cesium lead bromide perovskite nanocrystals using hydrobromic acid as halide source and n&#8208;trioctylphosphine (TOP) as ligand in open atmospheric conditions. The hydrobromic acid (HBr) served as labile source of bromide ion thus this three&#8208;precursor (separate precursors for Cs&#8208;Pb&#8208;Br) approach gives more control over conventional single source precursor for Pb and Br (PbBr  2  ). The use of HBr paved the way to eliminate oleylamine, thus we can completely exclude the formation of labile oleylammonium ion halide. We extensively studied the various Cs&#8208;Pb&#8208;Br molar ratio and found an optimum condition which able to make very stable with high PLQY CsPbBr  3  NCs. These completely amine free CsPbBr  3  perovskite NCs synthesized using bromine&#8208;rich condition exhibit good stability and durability for more than three months in the form of colloidal solutions and films respectively. More importantly, this work presents an open atmospheric stable CsPbBr  3  NCs films exhibiting high photoluminescence (PL) which can be further used for&#160;device applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Intermolecular C&#8211;H Activation at the Allylic/Benzylic and Homoallylic/Homobenzylic Positions of Cyclic Hydrocarbons by a Stable Divalent Silicon Species</title>
      <dc:description>Direct activation of inert C(sp  3  )&#8211;H bonds by main&#8208;group&#8208;element species is yet a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the dehydrogenation of cyclohexene and 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydronaphthalene through the allylic/benzylic and homoallylic/homobenzylic C&#8211;H bond activation by cyclic (alkyl)(amino)silylene  1  in neat condition to yield the corresponding aromatic compounds. As for the reaction of cyclohexene, allylsilane  3  and 7&#8208;silanorbornene  4  were also observed, which could be interpreted as a direct dehydrogenative silylation reaction of monoalkenes at the allylic positions. Experimental and computational studies suggested that the dehydrogenation of cyclohexene at the homoallylic position was accomplished by a combination of silylene  1  and radical intermediates such as hydrosilyl radical  INT1  or cyclohexenyl radical  H  which are generated in the initial step of the reaction.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Developing a bifunctional catalyst with low cost and high catalytic performance in NaBH4  hydrolysis for H2  generation and selective reduction of nitroaromatics will make a significant impact in the field of sustainable energy and water purification.

      <title>Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxygenation Coupling of Lignin&#8208;Derived Alcohols for Functionalized Bibenzyl Chemicals</title>
      <dc:description>With the growing demand for sustainability and reducing CO  2&#160;  footprint, lignocellulosic biomass has attracted much attention as a renewable, carbon&#8208;neutral and low&#8208;cost feedstock for the production of chemicals and fuels. To realize efficient utilization of biomass resource, it is essential to selectively alter the high degree of oxygen functionality of biomass&#8208;derivates. Herein, we introduced a novel procedure to transform renewable lignin&#8208;derived alcohols to various functionalized bibenzyl chemicals. This strategy relied on a concise deoxygenation coupling pathway with economical molybdenum catalyst. A well&#8208;designed H&#8208;donor experiment was performed to investigate the mechanism of this Mo&#8208;catalyzed process. It was proved that benzyl carbon&#8208;radical was the most possible intermediate to form the bibenzyl products. It was also discovered that the para methoxy and phenolic hydroxyl groups could stabilize the corresponding radical intermediates and then facilitate to selectively obtain bibenzyl products. Our research provides a promising application to produce functionalized aromatics from biomass&#8208;derived materials.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A Diels&#8211;Alder reaction&#8208;based strategy for the synthesis of indoles and related heterocycles is reported. An intramolecular cycloaddition of alkyne&#8208;tethered 3&#8208;aminopyrones gives 4&#8208;substituted indolines in good yield and with complete regioselectivity. Additional substitution is readily tolerated in the transformation, allowing synthesis of complex and non&#8208;canonical substitution patterns. Oxidative conditions give the corresponding indoles.

Directing groups facilitate the activation of inert C&#8211;O bonds in vastly under&#8208;utilized aryl methyl ethers enabling their adaptation for C&#8211;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions as less toxic surrogates to the ubiquitous haloarenes.

      <title>&#173;Rearrangements of Aromatic Nitrile Oxides and Nitrile Ylides. Potential Ring Expansion to Cycloheptatetraene Derivatives Mimicking Arylcarbenes</title>
      <dc:description>Nitrile imines, nitrile oxides and nitrile ylides are widely used in 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions. They also undergo thermal and photochemical rearrangements to carbodiimides, isocyanates, and ketenimines, respectively. Calculations at DFT and CASPT2 levels of theory reveal novel, potential rearrangements, in which the aromatic 1,3&#8208;dipoles mimic phenylcarbene and undergo ring expansion to cycloheptatetraene derivatives. These rearrangements can potentially take place in both the singlet ground states and the triplet excited states, and they are accelerated by m,m&#8217;&#8208;bis(dimethylamino) substitution on the phenyl moieties. The new rearrangement becomes the energetically preferred path for m,m&#8217;&#8208;bis(dimethylamino)benzonitrile oxide in the triplet state. In the m,m&#8217;&#8208;bis(dimethylamino)benzo nitrile ylide, the cyclization to the 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;azirine is favoured over the ring expansion to a cycloheptatetraene by ca. 5 kcal/mol in the singlet state. In the bent triplet states, 1,3&#8208;hydrogen shifts interconverting nitrile ylides are potentially possible.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Despite their apparent similarity, framework materials based on tetraphenylmethane and tetraphenylsilane building blocks often have quite different structures and topologies. Herein, we describe a new silicon tetraamidinium compound and use it to prepare crystalline hydrogen bonded frameworks with carboxylate anions in water. The silicon&#8208;containing frameworks are compared with those prepared from the analogous carbon tetraamidinium: when biphenyldicarboxylate or tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)methane anions were used similar channel&#8208;containing networks are observed for both the silicon and carbon tetraamidinium. When terephthalate or bicarbonate anions were used, different products form. Insights into possible reasons for the different products are provided by a survey of the Cambridge Structural Database and quantum chemical calculations, both of which indicate that, contrary to expectations, tetraphenylsilane derivatives have less geometrical flexibility than tetraphenylmethane derivatives,  i.e.  they are less able to distort away from ideal tetrahedral bond angles.</dc:description>

      <title>Low&#8208;Temperature, Ambient Pressure Oxidation of Methane to Methanol Over Every Tri&#8208;Iron Node in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Material</title>

Using MIL&#8208;100(Fe) as a prototype, we present the first example of a synthetic heterogeneous catalyst comprised exclusively of active tri&#8208;iron moieties participating in the low&#8208;temperature oxidation of methane to methanol; in contrast with prior reports on iron&#8208;MOFs, we report the near&#8208;exclusive formation of methanol at low temperatures and sub&#8208;ambient methane pressures, and evidence its effectuation solely by Fe2+ sites. The study captures the utility of exploring classes of materials endowed with a high level of definition in structure and catalytic function for the purposes of overcoming persistent scientific and technological challenges in the field of synthetic heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

      <title>Dinitrogen Fixation: Rationalizing Strategies Utilizing Molecular Complexes.</title>
      <dc:description>Dinitrogen (N  2  ) is the most abundant gas in the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, but its inertness hinders its use as a nitrogen source in the biosphere and in industry. Efficient catalysts are hence required to overcome the high kinetic barriers associated to N  2  transformation. In that respect, molecular complexes have demonstrated strong potential to mediate N  2  functionalization reactions under mild conditions while providing a straightforward understanding of the reaction mechanisms. This review emphasizes the strategies for N  2  reduction and functionalization using molecular transition metal and actinide complexes according to their proposed reaction mechanisms, distinguishing complexes inducing cleavage of the N&#8801;N bond before (dissociative mechanism) or concomitantly with functionalization (associative mechanism).

      <title>Alcohols as Fluoroalkyl Synthons: Ni&#8208;catalyzed Dehydrogenative Approach to Access Polyfluoroalkyl Bis&#8208;indoles</title>
      <dc:description>An acceptorless dehydrogenative strategy for the synthesis of polyfluoroalkylated bis&#8208;indoles is described by employing an earth&#8208;abundant nickel&#8208;based catalytic system under air. The notable feature of the present transformation is the use of bench stable and easily affordable polyfluorinated alcohols without any pre&#8208;functionalization for the introduction of precious polyfluoroalkyl groups. The developed straightforward protocol accomplished biologically relevant fluoroalkyl bis&#8208;indoles in a sustainable fashion. Extensive DFT study predicts the unique role of indole molecules which stabilizes the transition states during the dehydrogenation process of polyfluorinated alcohols, presumably through non&#8208;covalent &#960;&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;&#960; and H&#8208;bonding interactions.</dc:description>

The notable feature of the present transformation is the use of bench stable and easily affordable polyfluorinated alcohols without any pre&#8208;functionalization for the introduction of precious polyfluoroalkyl groups. The developed straightforward protocol accomplished biologically relevant fluoroalkyl bis&#8208;indoles in a sustainable fashion. Extensive DFT study predicts the unique role of indole molecules which stabilizes the transition states during the dehydrogenation process of polyfluorinated alcohols, presumably through non&#8208;covalent &#960;&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;&#960; and H&#8208;bonding interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Synchronous electrocatalytic design of architectural and electronic structure based on bifunctional LDH&#8208;Co3O4/NF towards water splitting</title>
      <dc:description>Rational design of highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting is extremely urgent for sustainable energy conversion process to alleviate energy crisis and environment pollution. In this work, by simply depositing layered double hydroxides (LDH) on Co  3  O  4  /NF (NF = Nickel foam) nanosheets arrays, the hierarchical Co  3+  &#8208;riched materials based on LDH&#8208;Co  3  O  4  /NF were designed as highly active and stable electrocatalysts for water splitting.

Such performance was due to the optimized electronic states with high concentration of Co  3+  which improved the intrinsic activity and the sheet&#8208;on&#8208;sheet hierarchical structure which increased the number of active sites. The unique synchronous design of both architectural and electronic structure of nanomaterials could accelerate the reaction kinetics and provide a more convenient charge transfer path simultaneously.

      <title>Cucurbit[n]urils for supramolecular catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>The control over chemical reactivity and selectivity are always pursued. Using non&#8208;covalent interactions to achieve efficient and selective catalysis is an essential goal of supramolecular catalysis. Supramolecular catalysis based on cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n]s) possesses distinct characteristics for the unique structure of CB[n]s. CB[n]s are a family of pumpkin&#8208;shaped host molecules with various molecular sizes, rigid structures, electronegative portals and wealthy host&#8208;guest chemistry. Herein, we summarize the three major mechanisms of CB[n]s based supramolecular catalysis. Owing to the structural properties of CB[n]s, CB[n]s can serve as nanoreactors and steric hindrance to modulate the reactivity of substrates. They can also catalyze the reactions by modulating the reactivity of ionized intermediates. Recent progresses on the CB[n]s based supramolecular catalysis are introduced in this mini&#8208;review and the future development in this field is discussed. It is anticipated that this review provides insights into the mechanism of CB[n]s based supramolecular catalysis and may help scientists find new opportunities in this field.</dc:description>

      <title>Pitch&#8208;based laminated carbon formed by pressure driving in low temperature as high&#8208;capacity anodes for lithium energy storage system</title>
      <dc:description>Pitch has been used to prepare electrodes by high&#8208;temperature heat&#8208;treatment for supercapacitors, lithium ion batteries, on account of its rich aromatic ring structure. Here, toluene soluble component of pitch is used to prepare a kind of laminated carbon. It was realized by a template&#8208;free synthesis in the low temperature with the addition of pressure. Toluene soluble component has a small molecular weight, it makes the thermal deformation ability stronger and then enhances the orientation of carbon layer with the help of pressure. The prepared anode exhibits a splendid electrochemical performance compared to the traditional graphite anode. A high stable capacity of ca. 550 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 50 mA g  &#8208;1  which is higher much than graphite (372 mAh g  &#8208;1  ) is obtained. And when the current density is up to 2 A g  &#8208;1  , the capacity is about 150 mAh g  &#8208;1  . Surprisingly, it also delivers a superior cycling performance. And when used as anode/cathode electrode for lithium ion capacitor, a high energy density can be obtained. The present work offers an opportunity to utilize the pitch source in lithium energy storage with promising cycle life, high energy/power density and low cost.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pitch has been used to prepare electrodes by high&#8208;temperature heat&#8208;treatment for supercapacitors, lithium ion batteries, on account of its rich aromatic ring structure. Here, toluene soluble component of pitch is used to prepare a kind of laminated carbon. It was realized by a template&#8208;free synthesis in the low temperature with the addition of pressure. Toluene soluble component has a small molecular weight, it makes the thermal deformation ability stronger and then enhances the orientation of carbon layer with the help of pressure. The prepared anode exhibits a splendid electrochemical performance compared to the traditional graphite anode. A high stable capacity of ca. 550 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 50 mA g  &#8208;1  which is higher much than graphite (372 mAh g  &#8208;1  ) is obtained. And when the current density is up to 2 A g  &#8208;1  , the capacity is about 150 mAh g  &#8208;1  . Surprisingly, it also delivers a superior cycling performance. And when used as anode/cathode electrode for lithium ion capacitor, a high energy density can be obtained. The present work offers an opportunity to utilize the pitch source in lithium energy storage with promising cycle life, high energy/power density and low cost.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Tuning Photoelectrochemical Performance of RuII&#8208;Sensitized Two&#8208;Dimensional MoS2</title>
      <dc:description>Covalently tethering photosensitizers to catalytically active 1T&#8208;MoS  2  surfaces holds great promise for the solar&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein we report the preparation of two new Ru  II  complex functionalized MoS  2  hybrids [Ru  II  (bpy)  2  (phen)]&#8208;MoS  2  and [Ru  II  (bpy)  2  (py)Cl]&#8208;MoS  2  . The influence of covalent functionalization of chemically exfoliated 1T&#8208;MoS  2  with coordinating ligands and Ru  II  complexes on the HER activity and photoelectrochemical performance of this dye&#8208;sensitized system was studied systematically. We find that the photoelectrochemical performance of this Ru  II  complex sensitized MoS  2  system is highly dependent on the surface extent of photosensitizers and the catalytic activity of functionalized MoS  2  . The latter was strongly affected by the number and the kind of functional groups. Our results underline the tunability of the photovoltage generation in this dye&#8208;sensitized MoS  2  system by manipulation of the surface functionalities, which provides a practical guidance for smart design of future dye&#8208;sensitized MoS  2  hydrogen production devices towards improved the photo&#8208;fuel conversion efficiency.</dc:description>

      <title>The role of fluorine in glycomimetic drug design</title>
      <dc:description>Glycans are well&#8208;established to play important roles at various stages of infection and disease, and ways to modulate these interactions have been sought as novel therapies. The use of native glycan structures has been met with limited success, which can be attributed to their characteristic high polarity (e.g. low binding affinities) and inherently poor pharmacokinetic properties (e.g. short drug&#8208;target residence times, rapid renal excretion), leading to the development of &#8216;glycomimetics.&#8217; Fluorinated drugs have become increasingly common over recent decades, with fluorinated glycomimetics offering some unique advantages.

Fluorination destabilizes the oxocarbenium transition state associated with metabolic degradation, and can restore  exo  &#8208; and  endo  &#8208;anomeric effects in C&#8208;glycosides and carbasugars.

      <title>Redox&#8208;Mediated Alcohol Oxidation Coupled to Hydrogen Gas Formation in a Dye&#8208;Sensitized Photosynthesis Cell</title>
      <dc:description>We report a dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrochemical cell (DSPEC) that couples redox&#8208;mediated light&#8208;driven oxidative organic transformations to reductive hydrogen (H2) formation. The DSPEC photoanode consists of a mesoporous anatase TiO2 film on FTO (fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide), sensitized with the thienopyrroledione&#8208;based dye AP11, while H2 was formed at a FTO&#8211;Pt cathode. Irradiation of the dye&#8208;sensitized photoanode transforms 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine 1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) to the oxidized TEMPO (TEMPO+), which acts as a chemical oxidant for the conversion of benzyl alcohol. The TEMPO0/+ couple, previously used as redox mediator in DSSC, mediates efficient electron transfer from the organic substrate to the photo&#8208;oxidized dye. A DSPEC photoreactor was designed that allows in situ monitoring the reaction progress by infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography. Sustained light&#8208;driven oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde within the DSPEC photoreactor, using of TEMPO as mediator, demonstrated the efficiency of the device, with a photocurrent of 0.4 mA cm&#8208;2, approaching quantitative Faradaic efficiency and exhibiting excellent device stability.</dc:description>

The DSPEC photoanode consists of a mesoporous anatase TiO2 film on FTO (fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide), sensitized with the thienopyrroledione&#8208;based dye AP11, while H2 was formed at a FTO&#8211;Pt cathode. Irradiation of the dye&#8208;sensitized photoanode transforms 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine 1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) to the oxidized TEMPO (TEMPO+), which acts as a chemical oxidant for the conversion of benzyl alcohol. The TEMPO0/+ couple, previously used as redox mediator in DSSC, mediates efficient electron transfer from the organic substrate to the photo&#8208;oxidized dye. A DSPEC photoreactor was designed that allows in situ monitoring the reaction progress by infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography. Sustained light&#8208;driven oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde within the DSPEC photoreactor, using of TEMPO as mediator, demonstrated the efficiency of the device, with a photocurrent of 0.4 mA cm&#8208;2, approaching quantitative Faradaic efficiency and exhibiting excellent device stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>High Efficiency FRET Processes in BODIPY Functionalized Quantum Dot Architectures</title>
      <dc:description>Efficient FRET systems are developed combining colloidal CdSe quantum dots (QDs) donors and BODIPY acceptors. To promote effective energy transfer in FRET architectures, the distance between the organic fluorophore and the QDs needs to be optimized by a careful system engineering. In this context, BODIPY dyes bearing amino&#8208;terminated functionalities are used in virtue of the high affinity of amine groups in coordinating the QD surface. A preliminary QD surface treatment with a short amine ligand is performed to favour the interaction with the organic fluorophores in solution. The successful coordination of the dye to the QD surface, accomplishing a short donor&#8208;acceptor distance, provides effective energy transfer already in solution, with efficiency of 76%. The efficiency further increases in solid state where the QDs and the dye are deposited as single coordinated units from solution, with a distance between the fluorophores down to 2.2 nm, demonstrating the effectiveness of the coupling strategy.</dc:description>

      <title>Merging Natural Products: Muraymycin&#8208;Sansanmycin Hybrid Structures as Novel Scaffold for Potential Antibacterial Agents</title>
      <dc:description>In order to overcome bacterial resistances, the need for novel antimicrobial agents is urgent. The class of so&#8208;called nucleoside antibiotics furnishes promising candidates for the development of new antibiotics, as these compounds block a clinically unexploited bacterial target: the integral membrane protein MraY, a key enzyme in cell wall (peptidoglycan) biosynthesis. Nucleoside antibiotics exhibit remarkable structural diversity beside their uridine&#8208;derived core motifs. Some sub&#8208;classes also show specfic selectivities towards different Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, which are poorly understood so far. Herein, we report the synthesis of a novel hybrid structure, derived from the 5'&#8208;defunctionalised uridine core moiety of muraymycins and the peptide chain of sansanmycin B, as a new scaffold for the development of antimicrobial agents. The reported muraymycin&#8208;sansanmycin hybrid scaffold showed nanomolar activity against the bacterial target enzyme MraY, but displayed no significant antibacterial activity against S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa.</dc:description>

      <title>Structure Directing Roles of Organic Molecules in the Formation of Aluminosilicate and Aluminophosphate Molecular Sieves Revealed by 2D 1H DQ&#8208;SQ NMR Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>Understanding of crystallization mechanisms of molecular sieves is driven by the broad range of usefulness and unique properties they possess. It is still difficult to obtain information related to their crystallization mechanism of molecular sieves, partly because the materials are generally prepared under hydrothermal conditions and the whole reactions have happened in the &#8220;black box&#8221; autoclave. In this work, 2D 1 H DQ&#8208;SQ NMR results clearly demonstrate that it is not only the electrostatic interactions between OSDAs and the framework, but also the correlation among OSDAs playing the dominant structural directing roles during the crystallization process.

      <title>Structure&#8208;Property Relationships in Bithiophenes with Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Substituents</title>
      <dc:description>The use of crystal engineering to control the supramolecular arrangement of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules in the solid&#8208;state is of considerable interest for the development of novel organic electronic materials. In the present study, we investigated the effect of combining of two types of supramolecular interactions with different geometric requirements, amide hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;interactions, on the &#960;&#8208;overlap between calamitic &#960;&#8208;conjugated cores. To this end, we prepared two series of bithiophene diesters and diamides with methylene, ethylene, or propylene spacers between the bithiophene core and the functional groups in their terminal substituents. The hydrogen&#8208;bonded bithiophene diamides showed significantly denser packing of the bithiophene cores than the diesters and other known &#945;,&#969;&#8208;disubstituted bithiophenes. The bithiophene packing density reach a maximum in the bithiophene diamide with an ethylene spacer, which featured the smallest longitudinal bithiophene displacement and infinite 1D arrays of electronically conjugated, parallel, and almost linear N&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O=C hydrogen bonds. The synergistic hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;interactions were attributed to the favorable conformational mechanics of the ethylene spacer and resulted in H&#8208;type spectroscopic aggregates in solid&#8208;state absorption spectroscopy. These results demonstrate that the optoelectronic properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials in the solid&#8208;state may be tailored systematically via side chain engineering, and hence that this approach has significant potential for the design of organic and polymer semiconductors.</dc:description>

      <title>New promises and opportunities in 3D printable inks based on coordination compounds for the creation of objects with multiple applications</title>
      <dc:description>This review focuses on the usefulness of coordination bonds to create 3D printable inks and shows how the union of chemistry and 3D technology contributes to new scientific advances, by allowing amorphous or polycrystalline solids to be transformed into objects with the desired shape for successful applications. The review clearly shows how there has been a considerable increase in the manufacture of objects based on the combination of organic matrices and coordination compounds. These coordination compounds are usually homogeneously dispersed within the matrix, anchored onto proper support, or coating the printed object, without destroying their unique properties. Advances are so fast that today it has already been possible to 3D print objects made exclusively from coordination compounds without additives. The new printable inks are made mainly with nano&#8208; non&#8208;porous coordination polymers, metal&#8208;organic gels, or metal&#8208;organic frameworks. The highly dynamic coordination bond allows the creation of objects with responses to stimuli that can act as sensors and drug delivery. In addition, the join of metal&#8208;organic frameworks with 3D print allows increasing the adsorption or selective capacity of the object concerning the original compound, being useful in energy storage, in gas separation, or water pollutant elimination. Furthermore, the metal ion's presence can give them new properties such as luminescence finding usefulness in sensors, or anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

      <title>Stepwise physisorption of alkoxy&#8208;pyrene derivatives onto a lamellar, non&#8208;porous naphthalenediimide&#8208;template on HOPG</title>
      <dc:description>The development of new strategies for the preparation of multicomponent supramolecular assemblies is a major challenge on the road to complex functional molecular systems. Here we present the use of a non&#8208;porous self&#8208;assembled monolayer from uC33&#8208;NDI&#8208;uC33, a naphthalenediimide symmetrically functionalized with unsaturated 33 carbon&#8208;atom&#8208;chains, to prepare bicomponent supramolecular surface systems with a series of alkoxy&#8208;pyrene (PyrOR) derivatives at the liquid/HOPG interface. While previous attempts at directly depositing many of these PyrOR units at the liquid/HOPG interface failed, the multicomponent approach through the uC33&#8208;NDI&#8208;uC33 template enabled control over molecular interactions and facilitated physisorption. The PyrOR deposition restructured the initial uC33&#8208;NDI&#8208;uC33 monolayer, causing an expansion in two dimensions to accommodate the guests. As far as we know, this represent the first example of a non&#8208;porous or non&#8208;metal complex&#8208;bearing monolayer that allows the stepwise formation of multicomponent supramolecular architectures on surfaces.</dc:description>

      <title>Breslow Intermediates (Aminoenols) and their Keto Tautomers: First Gas&#8208;Phase Characterization by IR Ion Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>Breslow intermediates (BIs) are the crucial nucleophilic amino enol intermediates formed from electrophilic aldehydes in the course of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed Umpolung reactions. Both in organocatalytic and enzymatic Umpolung, the question whether the Breslow intermediate exists as the nucleophilic enol, or in the form of its electrophilic keto&#8208;tautomer, is of utmost importance for its reactivity and function. We herein report the preparation of charge&#8208;tagged Breslow intermediates/keto tautomers derived from three different types of NHCs (imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenes, 1,2,4&#8208;triazolin&#8208;5&#8208;ylidenes, thiazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenes) and aldehydes. An ammonium charge&#8208;tag is introduced by either the aldehyde unit or the NHC. ESI&#8208;MS IR&#8208;Ion spectroscopy allowed for the unambiguous conclusion that in the gas&#8208;phase, the imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene derived BI indeed exists as a diamino enol, while both 1,2,4&#8208;triazolin&#8208;5&#8208;ylidenes and thiazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenes give the keto&#8208;tautomer. This result coincides with the tautomeric states observed for the BIs in solution (NMR) and in the crystalline state (XRD), and is in line with our earlier calculations on the energetics of BI keto&#8208;enol equilibria.</dc:description>
