         <title>The CdIn2S4/WO3 Nanosheet Composite Has a Significantly Enhanced Photo&#8208;electrochemical Cathodic Protection Performance and Excellent Electron Storage Capability</title>

Photo&#8208;electrochemical cathodic protection technology is considered to be a green metallic corrosion protection technology that uses solar energy to protect against corrosion without consuming any anode materials. A CdIn2S4/WO3 nanosheet composite film with electron self&#8208;storage properties was synthesized and used as a photoelectrode to couple with metallic materials to provide photo&#8208;electrochemical cathodic protection under light illumination and continuing cathodic protection in the dark. This research will promote the practical application of photo&#8208;electrochemical cathodic protection technology.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;electrochemical cathodic protection (CP) technology is considered to be a green metallic corrosion protection technology that uses solar energy to protect from corrosion and does not consume any anode materials. In this work, a CdIn2S4/WO3 nanocomposite photoelectrode was prepared, and its photo&#8208;electrochemical CP performance and mechanism were studied and analyzed. WO3 has a well band matching with CdIn2S4, leading to a significantly enhanced photo&#8208;electrochemical CP performance of the nanocomposite. Meanwhile, as confirmed in this work, the CdIn2S4/WO3 nanocomposite can store photoinduced electrons under light illumination through intercalation reactions and changing the valence state of tungsten. Moreover, it can discharge in the dark state to provide continuous CP for the coupled metals. This research will promote the practical application process of the photo&#8208;electrochemical CP technology.

         <title>Rb[Li5Si2O7] &#8211; A Latecomer in the Family of Alkali Lithosilicates Hiding a Green&#8208;Emitting Lithosilicate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 45, Page 11701-11706, August 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
After the rediscovery of alkali lithosilicates as phosphor materials, a new representative has been found. The novel compound with the sum formula Rb[Li5Si2O7] crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pbcm (no. 57), exhibiting a new structure type. Eu2+&#8208;doped Rb[Li5Si2O7] feigns an intense green luminescence, in reality co&#8208;crystallizing as a matrix around a tiny core of the known narrow&#8208;band green phosphor RbLi[Li3SiO4]2:Eu2+.







Abstract
In order to expand the field of alkali lithosilicates, a new representative of the substance class with a previously unknown structure type was found based on solid&#8208;state synthesis. The novel compound with the sum formula Rb[Li5Si2O7] crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pbcm (no. 57) with a=7.6269(3), b=9.5415(4), and c=9.4095(3)&#8197;&#197; by means of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The structure consists of a highly condensed lithosilicate framework, built up of corner&#8208; and edge&#8208;linked [LiO4]&#8208;tetrahedra and [Si2O7]&#8208;units, and the rubidium ions aligned in channels. Suitable crystals of the material were obtained using sealed tantalum ampoules as reaction tube at a temperature of 750&#8201;&#176;C. The new compound was further characterized via powder diffraction, Rietveld analysis, and EDX measurements. At first glance, Eu2+&#8208;doped Rb[Li5Si2O7] reveals an intense green luminescence. In&#8208;depth crystal analysis shows that a core&#8208;shell formation is present even for apparently high quality single&#8208;crystals. As a minority phase, the known green phosphor RbLi[Li3SiO4]2:Eu2+ is the origin of the luminescence, representing a tiny core inside of the particles surrounded by a large matrix of transparent Rb[Li5Si2O7] dominating the single&#8208;crystal diffraction pattern.

         <title>Bipyridinium and Phenanthrolinium Dications for Metal&#8208;Free Hydrodefluorination: Distinctive Carbon&#8208;Based Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 45, Page 11730-11737, August 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of novel organic dications as carbon&#8208;based Lewis acids is reported. The Hydride Ion Affinity (HIA) of these bipyridinium and phenanthrolinium salts is exploited to initiate hydrodefluorination catalysis. Further, the participation of these species enables deuterodefluorination. Experimental and DFT analysis support the role of the dications in the initiation of silylium&#8208;mediated catalysis.







Abstract
The development of novel Lewis acids derived from bipyridinium and phenanthrolinium dications is reported. Calculations of Hydride Ion Affinity (HIA) values indicate high carbon&#8208;based Lewis acidity at the ortho and para positions. This arises in part from extensive LUMO delocalization across the aromatic backbones. Species [C10H6R2N2CH2CH2]2+ (R=H [1&#8201;a]2+, Me [1&#8201;f]2+, tBu [1&#8201;g]2+), and [C12H4R4N2CH2CH2]2+ (R=H [2&#8201;a]2+, Me [2&#8201;b]2+) were prepared and evaluated for use in the initiation of hydrodefluorination (HDF) catalysis. Compound [2&#8201;a]2+ proved highly effective towards generating catalytically active silylium cations via Lewis acid&#8208;mediated hydride abstraction from silane. This enabled the HDF of a range of aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208; substituted sp3(C&#8722;F) bonds under mild conditions. The protocol was also adapted to effect the deuterodefluorination of cis&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;(CF3)3C6H9. The dications are shown to act as hydride acceptors with the isolation of neutral species C16H14N2 (3&#8201;a) and C16H10Me4N2 (3&#8201;b) and monocationic species [C14H13N2]+ ([4&#8201;a]+) and [C18H21N2]+ ([4&#8201;b]+). Experimental and computational data provide further support that the dications are initiators in the generation of silylium cations.

         <title>Monitoring the Structure Evolution of Titanium Oxide Photocatalysts: From the Molecular Form via the Amorphous State to the Crystalline Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 45, Page 11600-11608, August 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation mechanism of amorphous TixOy photocatalysts was studied by X&#8208;ray total scattering experiments and subsequent PDF analysis starting from titanium(IV) ethoxide precursor. Effects of the colour change upon UV illumination on the local Ti environment were investigated by PDF analysis and EELS. Transformation of amorphous TixOy to anatase&#8208;TiO2 by calcination was further examined by in&#8197;situ temperature dependent experiments.







Abstract
Amorphous TixOy with high surface area has attracted significant interest as photocatalyst with higher activity in ultraviolet (UV) light&#8208;induced water splitting applications compared to commercial nanocrystalline TiO2. Under photocatalytic operation conditions, the structure of the molecular titanium alkoxide precursor rearranges upon hydrolysis and leads to higher connectivity of the structure&#8208;building units. Structurally ordered domains with sizes smaller than 7&#8197;&#197; form larger aggregates. The experimental scattering data can be explained best with a structure model consisting of an anatase&#8208;like core and a distorted shell. Upon exposure to UV light, the white TixOy suspension turns dark corresponding to the reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+ as confirmed by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). Heat&#8208;induced crystallisation was followed by in&#8197;situ temperature&#8208;dependent total scattering experiments. First, ordering in the Ti&#8722;O environment takes place upon to 350&#8201;&#176;C. Above this temperature, the distorted anatase core starts to grow but the structure obtained at 400&#8201;&#176;C is still not fully ordered.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Bioactivity Mapping of Geodiamolide H</title>

         <dc:description>
The F&#8208;actin stabilizing natural product geodiamolide H and its analogues were comprehensively investigated. The first total synthesis of geodiamolide H was enabled by optimized, scalable building block synthesis, improved couplings, and by a ring&#8208;closing metathesis as a key step. Biological profiling of the synthesized library in cells, on target, and in silico uncovered potent and simplified non&#8208;natural analogues. Additional structure&#8208;activity relationship information was extracted for the whole class, useful for tool compound design.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of the actin&#8208;stabilizing marine natural product geodiamolide H was achieved. Solid&#8208;phase based peptide assembly paired with scalable stereoselective syntheses of polyketide building blocks and an optimized esterification set the stage for investigating the key ring&#8208;closing metathesis. Geodiamolide H and synthetic analogues were characterized for their toxicity and for antiproliferative effects in cellulo, by characterising actin polymerization induction in&#8197;vitro, and by docking on the F&#8208;actin target and property computation in silico, for a better understanding of structure&#8208;activity relationships (SAR). A non&#8208;natural analogue of geodiamolide H was discovered to be most potent in the series, suggesting significant potential for tool compound design.

         <title>Dianthracenylazatrioxa[8]circulene: Synthesis, Characterization and Application in OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 45, Page 11609-11617, August 11, 2021. </description>

Let there be light: A &#960;&#8208;extended, fully conjugated antiaromatic azatrioxa[8]circulene&#8208;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure has been prepared, fully characterized and used in as the emitter in brightly emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), inverted organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (IOLEDs) and quantum light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs).







Abstract
A soluble, green&#8208;blue fluorescent, &#960;&#8208;extended azatrioxa[8]circulene was synthesized by oxidative condensation of a 3,6&#8208;dihydroxycarbazole and 1,4&#8208;anthraquinone by using benzofuran scaffolding. This is the first circulene to incorporate anthracene within its carbon framework. Solvent&#8208;dependent fluorescence and bright green electroluminescence accompanied by excimer emission are the key optical properties of this material. The presence of sliding &#960;&#8208;stacked columns in the single crystal of dianthracenylazatrioxa[8]circulene is found to cause a very high electron&#8208;hopping rate, thus making this material a promising n&#8208;type organic semiconductor with an electron mobility predicted to be around 2.26&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. The best organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) device based on the dianthracenylazatrioxa[8]circulene fluorescent emitter has a brightness of around 16&#8201;000&#8197;Cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 and an external quantum efficiency of 3.3&#8201;%. Quantum dot&#8208;based OLEDs were fabricated by using dianthracenylazatrioxa[8]circulene as a host matrix material.

         <title>Highly Active Halogen Bonding and Chalcogen Bonding Chloride Transporters with Non&#8208;Protonophoric Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 45, Page 11738-11745, August 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving highly selective chloride over proton or hydroxide transport is crucial for the development of supramolecular anionophores for medical applications, where competing dissipation of pH gradients is undesired. Halogen and chalcogen bonding anionophores with record nanomolar activity are reported, and high selectivity for chloride over hydroxide is demonstrated to be achievable using these sigma&#8208;hole interactions.







Abstract
Synthetic anion transporters show much promise as potential anti&#8208;cancer agents and therapeutics for diseases associated with mis&#8208;regulation of protein anion channels. In such applications high activity and anion selectivity are crucial to overcome competing proton or hydroxide transport which dissipates cellular pH gradients. Here, highly active bidentate halogen bonding and chalcogen bonding anion carriers based on electron deficient iodo&#8208; and telluromethyl&#8722;triazole derivatives are reported. Anion transport experiments in lipid bilayer vesicles reveal record nanomolar chloride transport activity for the bidentate halogen bonding anion carrier, and remarkably high chloride over proton/hydroxide selectivity for the chalcogen bonding anionophore. Computational studies provide further insight into the role of sigma&#8208;hole mediated anion recognition and desolvation at the membrane interface. Comparison with hydrogen bonding analogues demonstrates the importance of employing sigma&#8208;hole donor motifs in synthetic anionophores for achieving both high transport activity and selectivity.

         <title>Suppressing Dehydroisomerization Boosts n&#8208;Butane Dehydrogenation with High Butadiene Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 45, Page 11643-11648, August 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of alkaline&#8208;earth metals into Pt&#8208;Ga2O3 catalyst can significantly suppress the dehydroisomerization and coke deposition during n&#8208;butane dehydrogenation, increase the Pt dispersity and stabilize Pt atoms at high temperature. Consequently, the optimal catalyst of 0.1Pt6Mg2Ga/S10 displays a n&#8208;butane conversion of 82.1&#8201;% at a butadiene selectivity of 34.7&#8201;% at 625&#8201;&#176;C, which has outperformed the reported catalysts for n&#8208;butane dehydrogenation.







Abstract
Butadiene (BD) is a critical raw material in chemical industry, which is conventionally produced from naphtha cracking. The fast&#8208;growing demand of BD and the limited oil reserve motivate chemists to develop alternative methods for BD production. Shale gas, which mainly consists of light alkanes, has been considered as cheap raw materials to replace oil for BD production via n&#8208;butane direct dehydrogenation (n&#8208;BDH). However, the quest for highly&#8208;efficient catalysts for n&#8208;BDH is driven by the current drawback of low BD selectivity. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for boosting the selectivity of BD by suppressing dehydroisomerization, an inevitable step in the conventional n&#8208;BDH process which largely reduces the selectivity of BD. Detailed investigations show that the addition of alkali&#8208;earth metals (e.&#8201;g., Mg and Ca) into Pt&#8208;Ga2O3/S10 catalysts increases Pt dispersity, suppresses coke deposition and dehydroisomerization, and thus leads to the significant increase of BD selectivity. The optimized catalyst displays an initial BD selectivity of 34.7&#8201;% at a n&#8208;butane conversion of 82.1&#8201;% at 625&#8201;&#176;C, which outperforms the reported catalysts in literatures. This work not only provides efficient catalysts for BD production via n&#8208;BDH, but also promotes the researches on catalyst design in heterogeneous catalysis.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The addition of alkaline-earth metals into Pt-Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst&lt;/b&gt; can significantly suppress the dehydroisomerization and coke deposition during &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-butane dehydrogenation, increase the Pt dispersity and stabilize Pt atoms at high temperature. Consequently, the optimal catalyst of 0.1Pt6Mg2Ga/S10 displays a &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-butane conversion of 82.1&#8201;% at a butadiene selectivity of 34.7&#8201;% at 625&#8201;&#176;C, which has outperformed the reported catalysts for &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-butane dehydrogenation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Butadiene (BD) is a critical raw material in chemical industry, which is conventionally produced from naphtha cracking. The fast-growing demand of BD and the limited oil reserve motivate chemists to develop alternative methods for BD production. Shale gas, which mainly consists of light alkanes, has been considered as cheap raw materials to replace oil for BD production via &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-butane direct dehydrogenation (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-BDH). However, the quest for highly-efficient catalysts for &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-BDH is driven by the current drawback of low BD selectivity. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for boosting the selectivity of BD by suppressing dehydroisomerization, an inevitable step in the conventional &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-BDH process which largely reduces the selectivity of BD. Detailed investigations show that the addition of alkali-earth metals (e.&#8201;g., Mg and Ca) into Pt-Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/S10 catalysts increases Pt dispersity, suppresses coke deposition and dehydroisomerization, and thus leads to the significant increase of BD selectivity.

         <dc:description>
Supersaddled copper corroles are a result of structural investigations towards non&#8208;planar distortion modes of porphyrinoids performed by the new digital tool PorphyStruct. The program introduces the technique of normal&#8208;mode structural decomposition (NSD) to porphyrinoids like the corroles, and while retaining the terminology of the NSD method, it is flexible with respect to the size and shape of the macrocycle perimeter.







Abstract
PorphyStruct, a new digital tool for the analysis of non&#8208;planar distortion modes of different porphyrinoids, and its application to corrole structures is reported. The program makes use of the normal&#8208;coordinate structure decomposition technique (NSD) and employs sets of normal modes equivalent to those established for porphyrins in order to describe the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane dislocation pattern of perimeter atoms from corroles, norcorroles, porphycenes and other porphyrinoids quantitatively and in analogy to the established terminology. A comparative study of 17 porphyrin structures shows very similar results to the original NSD analysis and no systematic error. Application to corroles is successful and reveals the necessity to implement an extended basis of normal modes for a large share of experimental structures. The results frequently show the concomitant occurence of several modes but remain interpretable. For group XI metal corroles the phenomenon of supersaddling was unravelled, allowing for more in&#8208;depths discussions of structure&#8208;function correlations.

         <title>A Disulfide Switch Providing Absolute Handedness Control in Double Helices via Conversion from the Antiparallel to Parallel Helical Pattern</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 45, Page 11663-11669, August 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The double&#8208;helical array of the aromatic oligoamide sequences can be switched from the antiparallel to parallel pattern through the transformation of thiol to disulfide. This enhances the bias of helical handedness and results in absolute chirality control of the double helices. The handedness mediated process can be governed by the thiol&#8208;disulfide oxidation&#8208;reduction cycle, thereby switching the structural arrangement and the enhancement of chiral bias.







Abstract
A strategy to reversibly switch the parallel/antiparallel helical conformation of aromatic double helices through the formation/breakage of a disulfide bond is presented. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures, NMR, and circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrate that the double helices with terminal thiol groups favor an antiparallel helical arrangement both in the solid state and in solution, while the P/M bias of helicity induced by chiral segments from another extremity of the sequence is weak in this structural motif. The antiparallel helices can be rearranged to parallel helices through the disulfide connection of the sequences. This change enhances the bias of helical handedness and results in absolute chirality control of the double helices. The handedness&#8208;mediated process can be governed by the oxidation&#8208;reduction cycle, thereby switching the structural arrangement and the enhancement of chiral bias. In addition, we find that the sequences can dimerize into an intermolecular double helix with the disulfide connection. And the helical handedness is also fully controlled due to the head&#8208;to&#8208;head structural motif.

Binding of naphthalenediimide (NDI) dyads at the interface of contiguous telomeric G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4) in hTel45 is revealed by synergically combining time&#8208;resolved fluorescence, induced circular dichroism and isothermal titration calorimetry and further rationalized with modeling data. In the absence of NMR and crystallographic data the approach used afforded new information that can help to rationalize the biological behavior of these ligands.







Abstract
Human telomeric DNA with hundreds of repeats of the 5&#8217;&#8208;TTAGGG&#8208;3&#8217; motif plays a crucial role in several biological processes. It folds into G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures and features a pocket at the interface of two contiguous G4 blocks. Up to now no structural NMR and crystallographic data are available for ligands interacting with contiguous G4s. Naphthalene diimide monomers and dyads were investigated as ligands of a dimeric G4 of human telomeric DNA comparing the results with those of the model monomeric G4. Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence, circular dichroism, isothermal titration calorimetry and molecular modeling were used to elucidate binding features. Ligand fluorescence lifetime and induced circular dichroism unveiled occupancy of the binding site at the interface. Thermodynamic parameters confirmed the hypothesis as they remarkably change for the dyad complexes of the monomeric and dimeric telomeric G4. The bi&#8208;functional ligand structure of the dyads is a fundamental requisite for binding at the G4 interface as only the dyads engage in complexes with 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry, lodging in the pocket at the interface and establishing multiple interactions with the DNA skeleton. In the absence of NMR and crystallographic data, our study affords important proofs of binding at the interface pocket and clues on the role played by the ligand structure.

         <title>FeII Metallohelices Stabilize DNA G&#8208;Quadruplexes and Downregulate the Expression of G&#8208;Quadruplex&#8208;Regulated Oncogenes</title>

Holding on and holding down: DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) represent attractive targets for cancer therapy. We show that metallohelices, which exhibit bioactivity emulating that of natural systems, bind with high affinity to G4 DNA and inhibit the activity of DNA polymerase by stabilizing G4 structures. Moreover, the investigated metallohelices downregulate the expression oncogenes in human embryonic kidney cells at the mRNA and protein levels, thus holding promise as potential multitarget drugs.







Abstract
DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) have been identified within the promoter regions of many proto&#8208;oncogenes. Thus, G4s represent attractive targets for cancer therapy, and the design and development of new drugs as G4 binders is a very active field of medicinal chemistry. Here, molecular biophysics and biology methods were employed to investigate the interaction of chiral metallohelices with a series of four DNA G4s (hTelo, c&#8208;myc, c&#8208;kit1, c&#8208;kit2) that are formed by the human telomeric sequence (hTelo) and in the promoter regions of c&#8208;MYC and c&#8208;KIT proto&#8208;oncogenes. We show that the investigated water&#8208;compatible, optically pure metallohelices, which are made by self&#8208;assembly of simple nonpeptidic organic components around FeII ions and exhibit bioactivity emulating the natural systems, bind with high affinity to G4 DNA and much lower affinity to duplex DNA. Notably, both enantiomers of a metallohelix containing a m&#8208;xylenyl bridge (5&#8201;b) were found to effectively inhibit primer elongation catalyzed by Taq DNA polymerase by stabilizing G4 structures formed in the template strands containing c&#8208;myc and c&#8208;kit2 G4&#8208;forming sequences. Moreover, both enantiomers of 5&#8201;b downregulated the expression of c&#8208;MYC and c&#8208;KIT oncogenes in human embryonic kidney cells at mRNA and protein levels. As metallohelices also bind alternative nucleic acid structures, they hold promise as potential multitargeted drugs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA G-quadruplexes (G4s) have been identified within the promoter regions of many proto-oncogenes. Thus, G4s represent attractive targets for cancer therapy, and the design and development of new drugs as G4 binders is a very active field of medicinal chemistry. Here, molecular biophysics and biology methods were employed to investigate the interaction of chiral metallohelices with a series of four DNA G4s (&lt;i&gt;hTelo&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;c-myc&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;c-kit1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;c-kit2&lt;/i&gt;) that are formed by the human telomeric sequence (&lt;i&gt;hTelo&lt;/i&gt;) and in the promoter regions of &lt;i&gt;c-MYC&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;c-KIT&lt;/i&gt; proto-oncogenes. We show that the investigated water-compatible, optically pure metallohelices, which are made by self-assembly of simple nonpeptidic organic components around Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; ions and exhibit bioactivity emulating the natural systems, bind with high affinity to G4 DNA and much lower affinity to duplex DNA. Notably, both enantiomers of a metallohelix containing a &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-xylenyl bridge (&lt;b&gt;5&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;) were found to effectively inhibit primer elongation catalyzed by &lt;i&gt;Taq&lt;/i&gt; DNA polymerase by stabilizing G4 structures formed in the template strands containing &lt;i&gt;c-myc&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;c-kit2&lt;/i&gt; G4-forming sequences. Moreover, both enantiomers of &lt;b&gt;5&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; downregulated the expression of &lt;i&gt;c-MYC&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;c-KIT&lt;/i&gt; oncogenes in human embryonic kidney cells at mRNA and protein levels. As metallohelices also bind alternative nucleic acid structures, they hold promise as potential multitargeted drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>An NHC&#8208;Stabilised Phosphinidene for Catalytic Formylation: A DFT&#8208;Guided Approach</title>

Introducing a low&#8208;valent phosphorus compound to the arena of catalysis: A N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;stabilised phosphinidene (1) was used for the activation of CO2. DFT calculations showed that the nucleophilicity of the phosphorus centre and a noncovalent &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction between the phenyl rings of phenylsilane and the catalyst synergistically drive the formylation of primary amides by CO2 under mild conditions.







Abstract
In recent years, the applications of low&#8208;valent main group compounds have gained momentum in the field of catalysis. Owing to the accessibility of two lone pairs of electrons, NHC&#8208;stabilised phosphinidenes have been found to be excellent Lewis bases; however, they cannot yet be used as catalysts. Herein, an NHC&#8208;stabilised phosphinidene, 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(phenylphosphanylidene)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H imidazole (1), for the activation of CO2 is reported.A closer inspection of the CO2 activation process by DFT calculations along with intrinsic bond orbital analysis shows that phosphinidene is associated with phenylsilane through a noncovalent &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction between two phenyl rings which activates the Si&#8722;H bond facilitating hydride transfer to the CO2 molecule. Detailed DFT studies along with spectroscopic experiments were combined to understand the mechanism of CO2 activation and its catalytic reductive functionalisation leading to the formylation of a range of chemically inert primary amides under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Active Tetrazine&#8208;Based Pincer Ligand for the Reduction of N&#8208;Oxyanions Using a Redox&#8208;Inert Metal</title>

With or without zinc: A redox&#8208;active ligand is shown to be active towards nitrite reduction to nitric oxide, with and without the presence of a coordinated electrophile, zinc. The pre&#8208;reduced ligand stores four protons and four electrons in two reduced tetrazine arms, all of which are used in reactivity with silver nitrite.







Abstract
The reaction chemistry of the bis&#8208;tetrazinyl pyridine ligand (btzp) towards nitrogen oxyanions coordinated to zinc is studied in order to explore the reduction of the NOx&#8722; substrates with a redox&#8208;active ligand in the absence of redox activity at the metal. Following syntheses and characterization of (btzp)ZnX2 for X=Cl, NO3 and NO2, featuring O&#8722;Zn linkage of both nitrogen oxyanions, it is shown that a silylating agent selectively delivers silyl substituents to tetrazine nitrogens, without reductive deoxygenation of NOx&#8722;1. A new synthesis of the highly hydrogenated H4btzp, containing two dihydrotetrazine reductants is described as is the synthesis and characterization of (H4btzp)ZnX2 for X=Cl and NO3, both of which show considerable hydrogen bonding potential of the dihydrotetrazine ring NH groups. The (H4btzp)ZnCl2 complex does not bind zinc in the pincer pocket, but instead H4btzp becomes a bridge between neighboring atoms through tetrazine nitrogen atoms, forming a polymeric chain. The reaction of AgNO2 with (H4btzp)ZnCl2 is shown to proceed with fast nitrite deoxygenation, yielding water and free NO. Half of the H4btzp reducing equivalents form Ag0 and thus the chloride ligand remains coordinated to the zinc metal center to yield (btzp)ZnCl2. To compare with AgNO2, experiments of (H4btzp)ZnCl2 with NaNO2 result in salt metathesis between chloride and nitrite, highlighting the importance of a redox&#8208;active cation in the reduction of nitrite to NO.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of 2&#8208;Arylindolines and 2,2&#8208;Disubstituted Indolines by Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 45, Page 11670-11675, August 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric synthesis of 2&#8208;arylindolines was achieved by kinetic resolution with n&#8208;butyllithium and the chiral ligand sparteine followed by electrophilic quench. The recovered starting materials and the 2,2&#8208;disubstituted products were isolated with high enantiomer ratios. Variable temperature NMR spectroscopy and DFT studies were used to determine the rate of Boc rotation.







Abstract
Kinetic resolution of 2&#8208;arylindolines (2,3&#8208;dihydroindoles) was achieved by treatment of their N&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl (Boc) derivatives with n&#8208;butyllithium and sparteine in toluene at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C followed by electrophilic quench. The unreacted starting materials together with the 2,2&#8208;disubstituted products could be isolated with high enantiomer ratios. Variable temperature NMR spectroscopy showed that the rate of Boc rotation was fast (&#916;G&#8800;&#8776;57&#8197;kJ/mol at 195&#8197;K). This was corroborated by DFT studies and by in&#8197;situ ReactIR spectroscopy. The enantioenriched N&#8208;Boc&#8208;2&#8208;arylindolines were converted to 2,2&#8208;disubstituted products without significant loss in enantiopurity. Hence, either enantiomer of the 2,2&#8208;disubstituted products could be obtained with high selectivity from the same enantiomer of the chiral ligand sparteine (one from the kinetic resolution and the other from subsequent lithiation&#8208;trapping of the recovered starting material). Secondary amine products were prepared by removing the Boc group with acid to provide a way to access highly enantioenriched 2&#8208;aryl and 2,2&#8208;disubstituted indolines.

         <title>Rationalizing the Mechanism of Peroxyformate Decomposition: Computational Insights To Understand Solvent Influence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 45, Page 11618-11626, August 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent effects revealed: An exhaustive mechanistic investigation into the decomposition of tert&#8208;butyl peroxyformate based on DFT calculations sheds light on how the reaction proceeds and how it is modulated depending on the nature and polarity of the surrounding medium. The computed mechanistic pathways are in excellent agreement with the experimental trends for a variety of polar and nonpolar solvents.







Abstract
The heterolytic decomposition of tert&#8208;butyl peroxyformate to tert&#8208;butanol and carbon dioxide, catalyzed by pyridine, is a long&#8208;known example of a reaction whose kinetics are strongly affected by solvent polarity.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Solvent effects revealed&lt;/b&gt;: An exhaustive mechanistic investigation into the decomposition of &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl peroxyformate based on DFT calculations sheds light on how the reaction proceeds and how it is modulated depending on the nature and polarity of the surrounding medium. The computed mechanistic pathways are in excellent agreement with the experimental trends for a variety of polar and nonpolar solvents.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heterolytic decomposition of &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl peroxyformate to &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butanol and carbon dioxide, catalyzed by pyridine, is a long-known example of a reaction whose kinetics are strongly affected by solvent polarity. From DFT and ab initio methods together with the SMD implicit solvation model, an extension on the formerly accepted mechanism is proposed. This novel proposal involves the formation of a carbonic acid ester intermediate and its further decomposition, through an unreported pyridine-mediated stepwise route. Computed barriers for this mechanism at DLPNO/CCSD(T)-def2-TZVP are in excellent agreement with experimental kinetic data across different solvents. Furthermore, the strong relationships between activation energies, geometric parameters in the transition state and the characteristics of the different solvents are also analyzed in depth.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>High&#8208;Spin Iron(VI), Low&#8208;Spin Ruthenium(VI), and Magnetically Bistable Osmium(VI) in Molecular Group 8 Nitrido Trifluorides NMF3</title>

In different states: Molecular hexavalent group 8 nitrido fluorides feature different electronic ground&#8208;state d2 configurations in solid Ne matrices. While NFeF3 adopts a high symmetry structure, the heavier homologues are subject to symmetry lowering and spin&#8208;crossover caused by a pseudo Jahn&#8722;Teller effect &#8220;hidden&#8221; in the excited states. For NOsF3 two coexisting high&#8208; and low&#8208;spin structures show triplet&#8211;singlet spin crossover and magnetic bistability. A weakened covalent N&#8722;Fe bond in NFeVIF3 indicates the non&#8208;innocent character of the nitrido ligand.







Abstract
Pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral nitrido trifluorides N&#8801;MF3 (M=Fe, Ru, Os) and square pyramidal nitrido tetrafluorides N&#8801;MF4 (M=Ru, Os) were formed by free&#8208;metal&#8208;atom reactions with NF3 and subsequently isolated in solid neon at 5&#8197;K. Their IR spectra were recorded and analyzed aided by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. For a d2 electron configuration of the N&#8801;MF3 compounds in C3v symmetry, Hund's rule predict a high&#8208;spin 3A2 ground state with two parallel spin electrons and two degenerate metal d(&#948;)&#8208;orbitals. The corresponding high&#8208;spin 3A2 ground state was, however, only found for N&#8801;FeF3, the first experimentally verified neutral nitrido FeVI species. The valence&#8208;isoelectronic N&#8801;RuF3 and N&#8801;OsF3 adopt different angular distorted singlet structures. For N&#8801;RuF3, the triplet 3A2 state is only 5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 higher in energy than the singlet 1A&#8242; ground state, and the magnetically bistable molecular N&#8801;OsF3 with two distorted near degenerate 1A&#8242; and 3A&#8220; electronic states were experimentally detected at 5&#8197;K in solid neon.

         <title>Competitive Coordination of Chloride and Fluoride Anions Towards Trivalent Lanthanide Cations (La3+ and Nd3+) in Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 45, Page 11721-11729, August 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical speciation of trivalent lanthanide Ln(III) in different molten salts is studied in this work. In molten LiCl&#8208;KCl&#8208;LnCl3, six chloride anions (Cl&#8722;, green ball) are coordinated with the trivalent lanthanide cation (Ln3+, orange ball) and form the [LnCl6]3&#8722; species (left). After the addition of LiF, the maximum number of fluoride anion (F&#8722;, purple ball) involved in the first coordination shell of Ln(III) is three, and the possible complexes are [LnCl5F]3&#8722;, [LnCl4F2]3&#8722;, and [LnCl4F3]4&#8722; (right).







Abstract
Molten salt electrolysis is a vital technique to produce high&#8208;purity lanthanide metals and alloys. However, the coordination environments of lanthanides in molten salts, which heavily affect the related redox potential and electrochemical properties, have not been well elucidated. Here, the competitive coordination of chloride and fluoride anions towards lanthanide cations (La3+ and Nd3+) is explored in molten LiCl&#8208;KCl&#8208;LiF&#8208;LnCl3 salts using electrochemical, spectroscopic, and computational approaches. Electrochemical analyses show that significant negative shifts in the reduction potential of Ln3+ occur when F&#8722; concentration increases, indicating that the F&#8722; anions interact with Ln3+ via substituting the coordinated Cl&#8722; anions, and confirm [LnClxFy]3&#8722;x&#8722;y (ymax=3) complexes are prevailing in molten salts. Spectroscopic and computational results on solution structures further reveal the competition between Cl&#8722; and F&#8722; anions, which leads to the formation of four distinct Ln(III) species: [LnCl6]3&#8722;, [LnCl5F]3&#8722;, [LnCl4F2]3&#8722; and [LnCl4F3]4&#8722;. Among them, the seven&#8208;coordinated [LnCl4F3]4&#8722; complex possesses a low&#8208;symmetry structure evidenced by the pattern change of Raman spectra. After comparing the polarizing power (Z/r) among different metal cations, it was concluded that Ln&#8722;F interaction is weaker than that between transition metal and F&#8722; ions.

         <title>The Construction of DNA Logic Gates Restricted to Certain Live Cells Based on the Structure Programmability and Aptamer&#8208;Cell Affinity of G&#8208;Quadruplexes</title>

         <dc:description>
By taking full advantage of the diversity and programmability of G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structure topologies, we elaborately designed a whole set of DNA basic logic gates. More significantly, by further using the selective affinity between aptamer G4 and its targeted cancer cells, a spatially restricted cellular INHIBIT logic gate was successfully achieved, whose operational sites can be restricted to specific live cells.







Abstract
DNA computation is considered a fascinating alternative to silicon&#8208;based computers; it has evoked substantial attention and made rapid advances. Besides realizing versatile functions, implementing spatiotemporal control of logic operations, especially at the cellular level, is also of great significance to the development of DNA computation. However, developing simple and efficient methods to restrict DNA logic gates performing in live cells is still a challenge. In this work, a series of DNA logic gates was designed by taking full advantage of the diversity and programmability of the G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structure. More importantly, by further using the high affinity and specific endocytosis of cells to aptamer G4, an INHIBIT logic gate has been realized whose operational site is precisely restricted to specific live cells. The design strategy might have great potential in the field of molecular computation and smart bio&#8208;applications.

Accessing the inaccessible: The use of the polypnictogen zirconium complexes [Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Zr(&#951;1:1&#8208;E4)] (E=P, As) at ambient temperatures as phosphorus or arsenic sources to transfer E4&#8197;units to CpRNi fragments was examined. This avoids the difficulty of handling and toxicity of white phosphorus and yellow arsenic. The transfer reactions gave access to a variety of polypnictogen transition metal complexes, among them unprecedented triple&#8208;decker&#8208;like compounds composed of cage entities as end&#8208;decks.







Abstract
The use of [Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Zr(&#951;1:1&#8208;E4)] (E=P (1&#8201;a), As (1&#8201;b), Cp&#8242;&#8242;=1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl) as phosphorus or arsenic source, respectively, gives access to novel stable polypnictogen transition metal complexes at ambient temperatures. The reaction of 1&#8201;a/1&#8201;b with [CpRNiBr]2 (CpR=CpBn (1,2,3,4,5&#8208;pentabenzyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl), Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242; (1,2,4&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl)) was studied, to yield novel complexes depending on steric effects and stoichiometric ratios. Besides the transfer of the complete En unit, a degradation as well as aggregation can be observed. Thus, the prismane derivatives [(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ni)2(&#956;,&#951;3:3&#8208;E4)] (2&#8201;a (E=P); 2&#8201;b (E=As)) or the arsenic containing cubane [(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ni)3(&#956;3&#8208;As)(As4)] (5) are formed. Furthermore, the bromine bridged cubanes of the type [(CpRNi)3{Ni(&#956;&#8208;Br)}(&#956;3&#8208;E)4]2 (CpR=Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;: 6&#8201;a (E=P), 6&#8201;b (E=As), CpR=CpBn: 8&#8201;a (E=P), 8&#8201;b (E=As)) can be isolated. Here, a stepwise transfer of En units is possible, with a cyclo&#8208;E42&#8722; ligand being introduced and unprecedented triple&#8208;decker compounds of the type [{(CpRNi)3Ni(&#956;3&#8208;E)4}2(&#956;,&#951;4:4&#8208;E&#8242;4)] (CpR=CpBn, Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;; E/E&#8242;=P, As) are obtained.

         <title>Cover Feature: Monitoring the Structure Evolution of Titanium Oxide Photocatalysts: From the Molecular Form via the Amorphous State to the Crystalline Phase (Chem. Eur. J. 45/2021)</title>

         <dc:description>
Titanium oxide photocatalysts with ordered domains of less than 7 &#197; in size were synthesized from titanium(IV) ethoxide as molecular precursor. UV light induces a color change from white to dark, corresponding to a change in the oxidation state of Ti. Upon heating, the structural order in the core of the as&#8208;synthesized particle extends. During transformation to anatase, the changes in the local structure were investigated by in situ total scattering experiments and subsequent pair distribution function (PDF) analysis. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C. Weidenthaler et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101117).

PorphyStruct is a new digital tool that allows quick and easy analyses of hidden conformational features of porphyrinoids from structural data. The software introduces the well&#8208;established technique of normal&#8208;mode structural decomposition (NSD) to porphyrinoids like the corroles, and while retaining the terminology of the NSD method, it is flexible with respect to the size and shape of the macrocycle perimeter. The cover image shows the utopia of a futuristic analysis laboratory where life&#8208;size molecules are analysed for such hidden structural characteristics. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;Krumsieck and M.&#8197;Br&#246;ring. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101243).

Photoelectrochemical cathodic protection technology is considered to be a green technology that protects metals from corrosion as it uses solar energy for corrosion protection and does not consume any anode materials. A CdIn2S4/WO3 nanosheet composite film with electron self&#8208;storage properties was synthesized and used as a photoelectrode to couple with metallic materials to provide photoelectrochemical cathodic protection under light illumination and continuous cathodic protection in the dark.

A Pd&#8208;catalyzed domino reaction of 1,8,13&#8208;tribromo&#8208;9&#8208;methoxytriptycenes is reported. Under conventional Suzuki coupling conditions, the triptycenes underwent multiple transformations to give 1,9&#8208;bridged triptycenes. Based on mechanistic investigations, a single Pd catalyst functions as Pd0, PdII and PdIV species to catalyze four distinct processes: 1)&#8197;aryl&#8208;to&#8208;alkyl 1,5&#8208;Pd migration, 2)&#8197;intramolecular arylation, 3)&#8197;homocoupling of phenylboronic acid and 4)&#8197;Suzuki coupling. More information can be found in the Communication by T. Iwata, M. Shindo et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101728).

         <title>Frontispiece: Contributions of Internal Atoms of Atomically Precise Metal Nanoclusters to Catalytic Performances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 45, August 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is extremely challenging to determine explicitly which atom(s) can contribute most to overall catalytic performance because the observed performance reflects an ensemble average from all the atoms in the catalyst. The emergence of atomically precise metal nanoclusters brings unprecedented opportunities to address the above central issue, as the crystal structures of such nanoclusters have been solved and a very fundamental understanding of metal catalysis can be attained at an atomic level. In this Minireview, we mainly focus on unveiling the mystery of how the internal atoms or vacancies of nanocluster catalysts can induce catalytic processes. We anticipate that the progress in this area could represent a novel conceptual framework for understanding the crucial roles of internal atoms of the catalysts in modulating catalytic properties. For more details, see the Minireview by Y. Zhu et&#8197;al. on page 11539&#8197;ff.

Analyzing the sum of the parts: It is challenging to determine explicitly which atom(s) contribute most to overall catalytic performance because the observed performance reflects an ensemble average from all the atoms in the catalyst. This review provides a new perspective on understanding the crucial roles of internal atoms of atomically precise metal nanocluster catalysts in tuning the catalytic properties.







Abstract
Every atom of a heterogeneous catalyst can play a direct or indirect role in its overall catalytic properties. However, it is extremely challenging to determine explicitly which atom(s) of a catalyst can contribute most to its catalytic performance because the observed performance usually reflects an average of all the atoms in the catalyst. The emergence of atomically precise metal nanoclusters brings unprecedented opportunities to address these central issues, as the crystal structures of such nanoclusters have been solved, and hence very fundamental understanding of nanocatalysis can be attained at an atomic level. This minireview focuses on recent efforts to reveal the contributions of the internal atoms or vacancies of nanocluster catalysts to the catalytic processes, including how the catalytic activity can be dramatically changed by the central doping of a foreign atom, how catalytic activation and inactivation can be reversibly switched by shuttling the central atom into and out of nanoclusters, and how evolution in catalytic activity can be driven by structural periodicity in the inner kernels of the nanoclusters. We anticipate that progress in this research area could represent a novel conceptual framework for understanding the crucial roles of internal atoms of the catalysts in tuning the catalytic properties.

Ever increasing energy demand warrant smarter and minimized electronic devices which insist advanced materials. This review is to delineate the journey of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) from their dawn to commercialization for smarter world, blended with structure&#8208;property relationships and theoretical investigation.







Abstract
Smarter and minimization of devices are consistently substantial to shape the energy landscape. Significant amounts of endeavours have come forward as promising steps to surmount this formidable challenge. It is undeniable that material scientists were contemplating smarter material beyond purely inorganic or organic materials. To our delight, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), an inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid scaffold with unprecedented tunability and smart functionalities, have recently started their journey as an alternative. In this review, we focus on such propitious potential of MOFs that was untapped over a long time. We cover the synthetic strategies and (or) post&#8208;synthetic modifications towards the formation of conductive MOFs and their underlying concepts of charge transfer with structural aspects. We addressed theoretical calculations with the experimental outcomes and spectroelectrochemistry, which will trigger vigorous impetus about intrinsic electronic behaviour of the conductive frameworks. Finally, we discussed electrocatalysts and energy storage devices stemming from conductive MOFs to meet energy demand in the near future.

         <title>Acylhydrazone Subunits as a Proton Cargo Delivery System in 7&#8208;Hydroxyquinoline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 45, Page 11559-11566, August 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dropping your H&#8242;s: Two structurally different acylhydrazones containing imine (1&#8201;a) and ketimine (2&#8201;a) functions have been evaluated as proton cargo delivery subunits in the 7&#8208;hydroxyquinoline platform. The tautomeric OH proton was delivered to the quinoline nitrogen by covalent (1&#8201;a) and hydrogen (2&#8201;a) bonding. The system is characterized by long stability in the switched state, thus enabling control of the bidirectional proton motion under different light energy.







Abstract
The reimagined concept of long&#8208;range tautomeric proton transfer using crane subunits is shown by designing and synthesising two new acylhydrazones containing a 7&#8208;hydroxyquinoline (7&#8208;OHQ) platform. The acylhydrazone subunits attached to the 7&#8208;OHQ at the 8th position act as crane arms for delivering proton cargo to the quinoline nitrogen. Light&#8208;induced tautomerization to their keto forms leads to Z/E isomerization of the C=C axle bond, followed by proton delivery to the quinoline nitrogen by the formation of covalent or hydrogen bonds. The axle&#8216;s being either an imine or ketimine bond is the structural difference between the studied compounds. The &#8722;CH3 group in the latter provides steric strain, resulting in different proton transport pathways. Both compounds show long thermal stability in the switched state, which creates a tuneable action of bidirectional proton cargo transport by using different wavelengths of irradiation. Upon the addition of acid, the quinoline nitrogen is protonated; this results in E/Z configuration switching of the acylhydrazone subunits.

     alt="Acylhydrazone Subunits as a Proton Cargo Delivery System in 7-Hydroxyquinoline"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dropping your H&#8242;s&lt;/b&gt;: Two structurally different acylhydrazones containing imine (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;
&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;) and ketimine (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;
&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;) functions have been evaluated as proton cargo delivery subunits in the 7-hydroxyquinoline platform. The tautomeric OH proton was delivered to the quinoline nitrogen by covalent (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;
&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;) and hydrogen (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;
&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;) bonding. The system is characterized by long stability in the switched state, thus enabling control of the bidirectional proton motion under different light energy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reimagined concept of long-range tautomeric proton transfer using crane subunits is shown by designing and synthesising two new acylhydrazones containing a 7-hydroxyquinoline (7-OHQ) platform. The acylhydrazone subunits attached to the 7-OHQ at the 8th position act as crane arms for delivering proton cargo to the quinoline nitrogen. Light-induced tautomerization to their keto forms leads to &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; isomerization of the C=C axle bond, followed by proton delivery to the quinoline nitrogen by the formation of covalent or hydrogen bonds. The axle&#8216;s being either an imine or ketimine bond is the structural difference between the studied compounds. The &#8722;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group in the latter provides steric strain, resulting in different proton transport pathways. Both compounds show long thermal stability in the switched state, which creates a tuneable action of bidirectional proton cargo transport by using different wavelengths of irradiation. Upon the addition of acid, the quinoline nitrogen is protonated; this results in &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; configuration switching of the acylhydrazone subunits. This was proven by single-crystal X-ray structure analysis and NMR spectroscopy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Erogorgiaene and the Pseudopterosin A&#8722;F Aglycone via Enantioselective Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrovinylation</title>

Applied metal catalysis: Exploiting a practical protocol for the asymmetric hydrovinylation of stryrenes in the opening move, the stereoselective total synthesis of bioactive constituents of the soft coral pseudopterogorgia elisabethae was efficiently achieved in sequence of metal&#8208;mediated steps to provide sufficient material for further biological investigations.







Abstract
Due to their pronounced bioactivity and limited availability from natural resources, metabolites of the soft coral Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae, such as erogorgiaene and the pseudopterosines, represent important target molecules for chemical synthesis. We have now developed a particularly short and efficient route towards these marine diterpenes exploiting an operationally convenient enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydrovinylation as the chirogenic step. Other noteworthy C&#8722;C bond forming transformations include diastereoselective Lewis acid&#8208;mediated cyclizations, a Suzuki coupling and a carbonyl ene reaction. Starting from 4&#8208;methyl&#8208;styrene the anti&#8208;tubercular agent (+)&#8208;erogorgiaene (&gt;98&#8201;% ee) was prepared in only 7 steps with 46&#8201;% overall yield. In addition, the synthesis of the pseudopterosin A aglycone was achieved in 12 steps with 30&#8201;% overall yield and, surprisingly, was found to exhibit a similar anti&#8208;inflammatory activity (inhibition of LPS&#8208;induced NF&#8208;&#954;B activation) as a natural mixture of pseudopterosins A&#8722;D or iso&#8208;pseudopterosin A, prepared by &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;xylosylation of the synthetic aglycone.

         <title>Radical C&#8722;H Trifluoromethoxylation of (Hetero)arenes with Bis(trifluoromethyl)peroxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 45, Page 11554-11558, August 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis(trifluoromethyl)peroxide (BTMP) is introduced as a new reagent for the C&#8722;H trifluoromethoxylation of arenes and heteroarenes. Readily accessed from inexpensive bulk chemicals, BTMP serves as a practical source of &#8226;OCF3 radicals upon activation through either visible light photoredox or TEMPO catalysis. Both methods deliver valuable fluorine&#8208;containing building blocks in a single step from (hetero)aromatic feedstocks.







Abstract
Trifluoromethoxylated (hetero)arenes are of great interest for several disciplines, especially in agro&#8208; and medicinal chemistry. Radical C&#8722;H trifluoromethoxylation of (hetero)arenes represents an attractive approach to prepare such compounds, but the high cost and low atom economy of existing .OCF3 radical sources make them unsuitable for the large&#8208;scale synthesis of trifluoromethoxylated building blocks. Herein, we introduce bis(trifluoromethyl)peroxide (BTMP, CF3OOCF3) as a practical and efficient trifluoromethoxylating reagent that is easily accessible from inexpensive bulk chemicals. Using either visible light photoredox or TEMPO catalysis, trifluoromethoxylated arenes could be prepared in good yields under mild conditions directly from unactivated aromatics. Moreover, TEMPO catalysis allowed for the one&#8208;step synthesis of valuable pyridine derivatives, which have been previously prepared via multi&#8208;step approaches.

Off and on again: A supramolecular approach was employed to regulate the catalytic activity of an amphiphilic metal complex pyrene&#8722;ruthenium (Py&#8722;Ru). The self&#8208;assembly of Py&#8722;Ru exhibited an enhanced catalytic efficiency in the transfer hydrogenation of NAD+ to NADH, which could be decreased by forming inclusion complex with cucurbituril. Through competitive replacement with amantadine, the activity of Py&#8722;Ru can be recovered. This supramolecular strategy provides an efficient and flexible method for constructing switchable catalysts.







Abstract
A switchable catalytic system has been designed and constructed with a host&#8722;guest interaction between cucurbituril (CB) and an amphiphilic metal complex pyrene&#8722;ruthenium (Py&#8722;Ru). Py&#8722;Ru can self&#8208;assemble into positively charged nanoparticles in water, and exhibits an enhanced catalytic efficiency in the transfer hydrogenation of NAD+ to NADH. After forming an inclusion complex with CB, Py&#8722;Ru aggregates are broken, leading to a decrease in catalytic efficiency, which can be recovered by competitive replacement with amantadine. This supramolecular strategy provides an efficient and flexible method for constructing reversible catalytic system, which also extends the application scope of the host&#8722;guest interaction.

         <title>Quadruple Role of Pd Catalyst in Domino Reaction Involving Aryl to Alkyl 1,5&#8208;Pd Migration to Access 1,9&#8208;Bridged Triptycenes</title>

A Pd&#8208;catalyzed domino reaction of 1,8,13&#8208;tribromo&#8208;9&#8208;methoxytriptycenes is reported. Under conventional Suzuki coupling conditions, the triptycenes underwent multiple transformations to give 1,9&#8208;bridged triptycenes. Based on mechanistic investigations, a single Pd catalyst functions as Pd0, PdII and PdIV species to catalyze (1) 1,5&#8208;Pd migration, (2) intramolecular arylation, (3) homocoupling of phenylboronic acid and (4) Suzuki coupling.







Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed domino reaction of 1,8,13&#8208;tribromo&#8208;9&#8208;methoxytriptycenes is reported. Under conventional Suzuki coupling conditions, the triptycenes underwent multiple transformations to give 1,9&#8208;bridged triptycenes. Based on mechanistic investigations, a single Pd catalyst functions as Pd0, PdII and PdIV species to catalyze four distinct processes: (1) aryl to alkyl 1,5&#8208;Pd migration, (2) intramolecular arylation, (3) homocoupling of phenylboronic acid and (4) Suzuki coupling. DFT calculations revealed that 1,5&#8208;Pd migration likely proceeds via both concerted PdII and stepwise PdIV routes. Asymmetric synthesis of the chiral triptycenes, as well as optical resolution, and further transformation are also reported.

DFT calculations revealed that 1,5-Pd migration likely proceeds via both concerted Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; and stepwise Pd&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; routes. Asymmetric synthesis of the chiral triptycenes, as well as optical resolution, and further transformation are also reported.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>PorphyStruct &#8211; A Digital Tool for the Quantitative Assignment of Non&#8208;Planar Distortion Modes in Four&#8208;Membered Porphyrinoids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 45, Page 11481-11481, August 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Porphyrinoid out&#8208;of&#8208;plane distortions have been in the focus of the group's research since our finding of a saddling mode being related to copper corrole non&#8208;innocence in 2007. Such modes could be quantified using J.&#8197;A. Shelnutts NSD method (normal&#8208;coordinate structure decomposition), but unfortunately the analysis was exclusive to metal porphyrins and metal chlorins. PorphyStruct is the result from our attempts to quantify these distortions for many different porphyrinoids with little effort, while retaining the established terminology.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;11580&#8197;ff.

         <title>A Porphyrin&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Framework for Metal&#8208;Free Photocatalytic Aerobic Oxidative Coupling of Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imine is an important intermediate in drug synthesis. Photocatalytic aerobic oxidative coupling of amines has been considered as a clean and promising way to produce imine and attracted great attentions. Herein, we designed and synthesized a novel two&#8208;dimensional porphyrin&#8208;based COF (Por&#8208;BC&#8208;COF) which adopts an AA stacking mode with excellent crystallinity, high Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller surface areas (1200 m 2 g &#8208;1 ), wide light absorption range (200&#8208;1300 nm) and good stability in a variety of organic solvents. Por&#8208;BC&#8208;COF can be used as a metal&#8208;free heterogeneous photocatalyst for the photocatalytic oxidation of amines to imines under visible light and red light with a high yield (97%). This work presents a novel and efficient COF photocatalyst in the application of light&#8208;driven organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Sensitive and Ultra&#8208;Stretchable Strain Sensors Based on Emulsion Gels with Broad Operating Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High stretchability (more than 1000&#8201;%) and conductivity (0.67&#8197;S/m) emulsion gels were fabricated from emulsions and the introduction of glycerol endowed them with broad operating temperature (&#8722;20 to 90&#8201;&#176;C). The emulsion gel based strain sensors showed high sensitivity (gauge factor=6.240), fatigue resistance, self&#8208;healing and adhesion properties, realizing the repeatable and accurate detection of full&#8208;range human motions.







Abstract
Hydrogels with mechanical elasticity and conductivity are ideal materials in wearable devices. However, traditional hydrogels are fragile upon mechanical loading and lose functions in climate change because the internal water undergoes freeze and dehydration. Herein, we synthesize stable emulsions at high and low temperatures by introducing glycerol into the W/W emulsions. Then the high&#8208;stable emulsions are used as templates to produce the freestanding emulsion gels with enhanced mechanical strength and conductivity. The introduction of glycerol endows emulsions and emulsion gels with high and low temperature resistance (&#8722;20 to 90&#8201;&#176;C). The fabricated strain sensors based on emulsion gels show high sensitivity (gauge factor=6.240), high stretchability (1081&#8201;%), fatigue resistance, self&#8208;healing and adhesion properties, realizing the repeatable and accurate detection of various human motions. These high&#8208;performance and eco&#8208;friendly emulsion gels can be promising candidates for next&#8208;generation artificial skin and human&#8208;machine interface.

         <title>A Chiral Molecular Cage Comprising Diethynylallenes and N&#8208;Heterotriangulenes for Enantioselective Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It's a match! A novel shape&#8208;persistent chiral cage constituting two N&#8208;heterotriangulene lids and three bis(diethynylallene) branches is reported, along with UV/vis complexation studies with both charged and neutral helicenes. Enantioselective discrimination was observed, which, in combination with the redox behavior of the host, makes the system appealing as a model for dual sensors with both chiral and electronic modulation.







Abstract
Chirality, a characteristic tool of molecular recognition in nature, is often a complement of redox active systems. Scientists, in their eagerness to mimic such sophistication, have designed numerous chiral systems based on molecular entities with cavities, such as macrocycles and cages. In an attempt to combine chirality and redox&#8208;active species, in this contribution we report the synthesis and detailed characterization of a chiral shape&#8208;persistent molecular cage based on the combination of enantiopure diethynylallenes and electron&#8208;rich bridged triarylamines, also known as N&#8208;heterotriangulenes. Its ability for chiral recognition in solution was revealed through UV/vis titrations with enantiopure helicenes.

         <title>Modulating the Enantiodiscrimination Features of Inherently Chiral Selectors by Molecular Design: A HPLC and Voltammetry Study Case with Atropisomeric 2,2&#8217;&#8208;Biindole&#8208;Based Monomers and Oligomer Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of inherently chiral electroactive selectors based on the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biindole atropisomeric scaffold is studied in two enantiodiscrimination contests: as probes in enantioselective HPLC and as selectors in chiral voltammetry for successful discrimination of the enantiomers of chiral electroactive probes, either by conversion into enantiopure electroactive electrode surfaces or as chiral additive in achiral ionic liquid.







Abstract
A family of inherently chiral electroactive selectors based on the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biindole atropisomeric scaffold, of easy synthesis and modulable functional properties, is studied in cascade in two enantioselection contexts. They are at first investigated as probes in enantioselective HPLC, studying molecular structure and temperature effects, and achieving very efficient semipreparative enantioseparation. The enantiomers thus obtained, of remarkable chiroptical features (optical rotation as well as circular dichroism), are successfully applied as selectors in chiral voltammetry in different media for discrimination of the enantiomers of chiral electroactive probes, either by conversion into enantiopure electroactive electrode surfaces by electrooligomerization on glassy carbon substrate (the two monomers with shorter alkyl chains), or as chiral additive in achiral ionic liquid (the monomer with longest alkyl chains). Discrimination is conveniently and reproducibly achieved in terms of significant potential differences for the two enantiomers, specularly inverting either probe or selector configuration. In one case successful discrimination is also observed with the two probe enantiomers concurrently present, either as racemate or with enantiomeric excesses, neatly accounted for by the peak current ratios.

         <title>Engineered Cyclotides with Potent Broad in Vitro and in Vivo Antimicrobial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ESKAPE kit: A novel engineered cyclotide has effective broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity against several ESKAPE bacterial clinical isolates. The most active antibacterial cyclotide showed high in vivo efficacy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a human pathogen known to produce chronic lung infection in humans. These findings suggest the possibility of designing novel therapeutics based on the cyclotide scaffold. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;A. Camarero et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101438).

         <title>Hydrophobic Metal&#8722;Organic Frameworks and Derived Composites for Microelectronics Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Don't rain on my parade: Hydrophobic metal&#8722;&#959;rganic frameworks (MOFs) and derived composites for microelectronics applications are highlighted. Several methodologies including the incorporation of long alkyl chains and fluorinated linkers, doping with redox&#8208;active species, etc., to produce hydrophobic MOFs with improved dielectric and conductivity properties are discussed.







Abstract
The extraordinary characteristic features of metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs) make them applicable for use in a variety of fields but their conductivity in microelectronics over a wide relative humidity (RH) range has not been extensively explored. To achieve good performance, MOFs must be stable in water, i.&#8201;e., under humid conditions. However, the design of ultrastable hydrophobic MOFs with high conductivity for use in microelectronics as conducting and dielectric materials remains a challenge. In this Review, we discuss applications of an emerging class of hydrophobic MOFs with respect to their use as active sensor coatings, tunable low&#8208;&#954; dielectrics and conductivity, which provide high&#8208;level roadmap for stimulating the next steps toward the development and implementation of hydrophobic MOFs for use in microelectronic devices. Several methodologies including the incorporation of long alkyl chain and fluorinated linkers, doping of redox&#8208;active 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ), the use of guest molecules, and conducting polymers or carbon materials in the pores or surface of MOFs have been utilized to produce hydrophobic MOFs. The contact angle of a water droplet and a coating can be used to evaluate the degree of hydrophobicity of the surface of a MOF. These unique advantages enable hydrophobic MOFs to be used as a highly versatile platform for exploring multifunctional porous materials. Classic representative examples of each category are discussed in terms of coordination structures, types of hydrophobic design, and potential microelectronic applications. Lastly, a summary and outlook as concluding remarks in this field are presented. We envision that future research in the area of hydrophobic MOFs promise to provide important breakthroughs in microelectronics applications.

         <title>Ready Access to Anhydrous Anionic Lanthanide Acetates by Using Imidazolium Acetate Ionic Liquids as the Reaction Medium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward pathway to synthesize anhydrous lanthanide acetate complexes from lanthanide chloride hydrates and the ionic liquid (IL) 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium acetate ([C2mim][OAc]) is described. The combination of the lanthanide size and the amount of IL introduced allows the selective formation of two isostructural crystalline anhydrous compounds the dimeric, [C2mim]2[Ln2(OAc)8], and the polymeric, [C2mim]n[{Ln2(OAc)7}n].







Abstract
Access to lanthanide acetate coordination compounds is challenged by the tendency of lanthanides to coordinate water and the plethora of acetate coordination modes. A straightforward, reproducible synthetic procedure by treating lanthanide chloride hydrates with defined ratios of the ionic liquid (IL) 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium acetate ([C2mim][OAc]) has been developed. This reaction pathway leads to two isostructural crystalline anhydrous coordination complexes, the polymeric [C2mim]n[{Ln2(OAc)7}n] and the dimeric [C2mim]2[Ln2(OAc)8], based on the ion size and the ratio of IL used. A reaction with an IL&#8201;:&#8201;Ln&#8208;salt ratio of 5&#8201;:&#8201;1, where Ln=Nd, Sm, and Gd, led exclusively to the polymer, whilst for the heaviest lanthanides (Dy&#8722;Lu) the dimer was observed. Reaction with Eu and Tb resulted in a mixture of both polymeric and dimeric forms. When the amount of IL and/or the size of the cation was increased, the reaction led to only the dimeric compound for all the lanthanide series. Crystallographic analyses of the resulting salts revealed three different types of metal&#8208;acetate coordination modes where &#951;2&#956;&#954;2 is the most represented in both structure types.

         <title>Dicyano&#8208;Imidazole: A Facile Generation of Pure Blue TADF Materials for OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pure blue&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on dicyano&#8208;imidazole with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) have been studied at Providence University (of which a building is shown). The efficiencies obtained in this work are the highest among the reported imidazole&#8208;based TADF&#8208;OLEDs. By combining these tailor&#8208;made TADF compounds with specific device architectures, electroluminescent emission from sky blue to deep blue could be achieved. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C.&#8208;W. Lu et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101807).

         <title>Stability of AgIII towards Halides in Organosilver(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surprising silver: The binary silver(I) halides, AgX, are well&#8208;known chemical species. In contrast, the only binary halide of silver(III) currently known is the fluoride AgF3. The CF3 group provides a suitable frame to stabilise silver(III) compounds with every halogen; these have been isolated and thoroughly characterised. Multistage unimolecular fragmentation experiments demonstrate that the Ag&#8722;X bond is surprisingly robust. The sobriety of silver thus perfectly matches the colourful variety of halogens. More information can be found in the Full Paper by B. Menj&#243;n et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101859).

         <title>Towards an understanding of the molecular mechanisms of variable unnatural base pair behavior&#8212;A biophysical analysis of dNaM&#8208;dTPT3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The series of unnatural base pairs (UBPs) developed by the Romesberg lab which pair via hydrophobic and packing interactions have been replicated, transcribed, and translated inside of a living organism. However, as to why these UBPs exhibit variable fidelity and efficiency when used in different contexts is not clear. In an effort to gain some insights, we investigated the thermal stability and pairing selectivity of the (d) NaM &#8208;(d) TPT3 UBP in 11nt duplexes via UV spectroscopy and the effects on helical structure via CD spectroscopy. We observed that while the duplexes containing a UBP are less stable than fully natural duplexes, they are generally more stable than duplexes containing natural mispairs. This work provides the first insights connecting the thermal stability of the (d) NaM &#8208;(d) TPT3 UBP to the molecular mechanisms for varying replication fidelity in different sequence contexts in DNA, asymmetrical transcription fidelity, and codon:anticodon interactions and can assist in future UBP development.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Tuning Band Gaps of Cu2O and TiO2&#160;to&#160;form&#160;S&#8208;Scheme Hetero&#8208;Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic Z or S scheme merits higher redox potentials and faster charge separation. However, heterostructure photocatalyst having band gaps of bulk materials often has a type I band structure leading to poor photocatalytic activity. In view of this, we report simultaneous tuning of band gaps of Cu  2  O and TiO  2  , where quantum dot Cu  2  O nanoparticles were formed on doped TiO  2  with Ti  3+  .  The shrunk size of Cu  2  O made its conduction band more negative while the introduction of Ti  3+  made absorption edge red shift to visible light region. The as&#8208;formed heterostructure enabled S&#8208;Scheme mechanism with remarkable activity and stability for visible light photodegradation of 4&#8208;chlorophenol (4&#8208;CP). The as&#8208;obtained photocatalysts&#8217; activity demonstrated ca. 510 folds increase as compared to individual ones and mechanical blend. The as&#8208;obtained photocatalysts maintained over 80% for 5 cycles and 2 months exposure to O  2  did not decrease degradation rate. ESR characterization and scavengers&#8217; experiments proved S&#8208;Scheme mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Titanium Vacancies in TiO2 Nanofibers Enable Highly Efficient Photo&#8208;Driven Seawater Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo&#8208;driven seawater splitting is considered as one of the most promising techniques for sustainable hydrogen production. However, the high salinity of seawater would deactivate catalysts and consumes the photogenerated carriers. Metal vacancies in metal oxide semiconductors are critical to directed electron transfer and high salinity resistance, thus desirable but remains a challenge. We demonstrate a facile controllable calcination approach to synthesize TiO  2  nanofibers with rich Ti&#8208;vacancies with excellent photo/electro performances and long&#8208;time stability in photo&#8208;driven seawater splitting, including photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis. Experimental measurements and theoretical calculations reveal the formation of titanium vacancies, as well as its unidirectional electron trap and superior H  +  adsorption ability for efficient charge transfer and corrosion resistance of seawater. Therefore, the characteristics and mechanism have been proposed at an atomic&#8208;/nanoscale to clarify the generation of titanium vacancies and the corresponding interfacial electron transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>A Water Molecule Triggers Guest Exchange at a Mono&#8208;Zinc Centre Confined in a Biomimetic Calixarene Pocket: a Model for Understanding Ligand Stability in Zn Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ligand exchange mechanism at a ZnII centre embedded in a calix[6]arene pocket mimicking the constrains induced by a proteic structure was probed by 1D EXSY NMR experiments and DFT calculations. Results highlight: i) the very high kinetic stability of a tetrahedral ZnII centre when coordination of a fifth ligand is precluded by the environment, ii) the necessary associative double&#8208;exchange mechanism for ligand exchange, and iii) the key role that a single water molecule can play in catalysing the exchange.







Abstract
In this study, the ligand exchange mechanism at a biomimetic ZnII centre, embedded in a pocket mimicking the possible constrains induced by a proteic structure, is explored. The residence time of different guest ligands (dimethylformamide, acetonitrile and ethanol) inside the cavity of a calix[6]arene&#8208;based tris(imidazole) tetrahedral zinc complex was probed using 1D EXchange SpectroscopY NMR experiments. A strong dependence of residence time on water content was observed with no exchange occurring under anhydrous conditions, even in the presence of a large excess of guest ligand. These results advocate for an associative exchange mechanism involving the transient exo&#8208;coordination of a water molecule, giving rise to 5&#8208;coordinate ZnII intermediates, and inversion of the pyramid at the ZnII centre. Theoretical modelling by DFT confirmed that the associative mechanism is at stake. These results are particularly relevant in the context of the understanding of kinetic stability/lability in Zn proteins and highlight the key role that a single water molecule can play in catalysing ligand exchange and controlling the lability of ZnII in proteins.

         <title>Progress and Perspectives on Covalent&#8208;organic Frameworks (COFs) and Composites for Various Energy Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) outline a resourceful illustration by uniting the remarkable properties of materials such as structural and chemical modulation, porosity and crystallinity, which can be productive for different types of metal&#8208;ion batteries, supercapacitors, water splitting (Hydrogen evolution reaction, HER and Oxygen evolution reaction, OER) and solar cells.







Abstract
Covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs), being a new member of the crystalline porous materials family, have emerged as important materials for energy storage/conversion/generation devices. They possess high surface areas, ordered micro/mesopores, designable structures and an ability to precisely control electro&#8208;active groups in their pores, which broaden their application window. Thanks to their low weight density, long range crystallinity, reticular nature and tunable synthesis approach towards two and three dimensional (2D and 3D) networks, they have been found suitable for a range of challenging electrochemical applications. Our review focuses on the progress made on the design, synthesis and structure of COFs and their composites for various energy applications, such as metal&#8208;ion batteries, supercapacitors, water&#8208;splitting and solar cells. Additionally, attempts have been made to correlate the structural and mechanistic characteristics of COFs with their applications.

         <title>Design, Synthesis, Evaluation and Structure of Allenic 1&#945;,25&#8208;Dihydroxyvitamin D3 Analogs with Locked Mobility at C&#8208;17</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Looking for side&#8208;chain conformational requirements of vitamin D analogs for selective biological activity, a new active vitamin D analog that has conformationally restricted mobility at the side chain and adopts a similar structure than the natural hormone 1&#945;,25&#8208;dihydroxyvitamin D3 in the binding pocket was designed by docking and synthesized. The highlights of the synthesis include a Pd0&#8208;catalyzed cascade and an orthoester&#8208;Claisen&#8208;rearrangement for the formation of the trienic system and the allenic side&#8208;chain, respectively.







Abstract
Vitamin D receptor ligands have potential for the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases and disorders related to the immune system. However, hypercalcemic effects limit their therapeutical uses and call for the development of tissue&#8208;selective new analogs. We have designed and synthesized the first examples of 1&#945;,25&#8208;dihydroxyvitamin D3 analogs bearing an allenic unit attached to the D ring to restrict the side&#8208;chain conformational mobility. The triene system was constructed by a Pd0&#8208;mediated cyclization/Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling process in the presence of an allenic side chain. The allenic moiety was built through an orthoester&#8208;Claisen rearrangement of a propargylic alcohol. The biological activity and structure of (22S)&#8208;1&#945;,25&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;17,20&#8208;dien&#8208;24&#8208;homo&#8208;21&#8208;nor&#8208;vitamin D3 bound to binding domain of the vitamin D receptor, provide information concerning side&#8208;chain conformational requirements for biological activity.

The highlights of the synthesis include a Pd&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;-catalyzed cascade and an orthoester-Claisen-rearrangement for the formation of the trienic system and the allenic side-chain, respectively.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D receptor ligands have potential for the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases and disorders related to the immune system. However, hypercalcemic effects limit their therapeutical uses and call for the development of tissue-selective new analogs. We have designed and synthesized the first examples of 1&#945;,25-dihydroxyvitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; analogs bearing an allenic unit attached to the D ring to restrict the side-chain conformational mobility. The triene system was constructed by a Pd&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;-mediated cyclization/Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling process in the presence of an allenic side chain. The allenic moiety was built through an orthoester-Claisen rearrangement of a propargylic alcohol. The biological activity and structure of (22&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-1&#945;,25-dihydroxy-17,20-dien-24-homo-21-nor-vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; bound to binding domain of the vitamin D receptor, provide information concerning side-chain conformational requirements for biological activity.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Molecular Recognition of Nerve Agents and Their Organophosphorus Surrogates: Toward Supramolecular Scavengers and Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nerve agents are lethal organophosphorus compounds (OPs), posing a serious threat to military and civilians. In spite of decades invested toward developing detoxifying systems acting as prophylactics or therapeutics, there has been insufficient progress. In this critical review, we posit that examining molecular recognition of nerve agents shall help constructing more effective scavengers of OPs.







Abstract
Nerve agents are tetrahedral organophosphorus compounds (OPs) that were developed in the last century to irreversibly inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and therefore impede neurological signaling in living organisms. Exposure to OPs leads to a rapid development of symptoms from excessive salivation, nasal congestion and chest pain to convulsion and asphyxiation which if left untreated may lead to death. These potent toxins are prepared on a large scale from inexpensive staring materials, making it feasible for terrorist groups or states to use them against military and civilians. The existing antidotes provide limited protection and are difficult to apply to a large number of affected individuals. While new prophylactics are currently being developed, there is still need for therapeutics capable of both preventing and reversing the effects of OP poisoning. In this review, we describe how the science of molecular recognition can expand the pallet of tools for rapid and safe sequestration of nerve agents.

         <dc:description>
Keep it simple: A sustainable approach (ethyl acetate under ambient conditions without metals, additives or irradiation) for the synthesis of di&#8208; and tetra&#8208;hydroquinolines bearing one or two SO2CF3 groups has been developed.A Convenient Formal [4+2] Heterocylization Route to Bis(triflyl)tetrahydroquinolines (L&#225;zaro&#8208;Milla and Almendros) @IQOG_CSIC







Abstract
We report the sustainable and efficient synthesis of a new type of quinoline derivatives bearing one or two SO2CF3 groups. The protocol is metal&#8208;, catalyst&#8208; and irradiation&#8208;free, involves the use of readily available and stable precursors, and avoids the formation of side products. Also, the mild conditions of the process allow the tolerance of a wide range of functional groups.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Techniques for the Structural Characterization of Geminal Alane&#8208;Phosphane Frustrated Lewis Pairs and Secondary Adducts</title>

Abstract
The first comprehensive solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) characterization of geminal alane&#8208;phosphane frustrated Lewis pairs (Al/P FLPs) is reported. Their relevant NMR parameters (isotropic chemical shifts, direct and indirect 27Al&#8208;31P spin&#8208;spin coupling constants, and 27Al nuclear electric quadrupole coupling tensor components) have been determined by numerical analysis of the experimental NMR line shapes and compared with values computed from the known crystal structures by using density functional theory (DFT) methods. Our work demonstrates that the 31P NMR chemical shifts for the studied Al/P FLPs are very sensitive to slight structural inequivalences. The 27Al NMR central transition signals are spread out over a broad frequency range (&gt;200&#8197;kHz), owing to the presence of strong nuclear electric quadrupolar interactions that can be well&#8208;reproduced by the static 27Al wideband uniform rate smooth truncation (WURST) Carr&#8208;Purcell&#8208;Meiboom&#8208;Gill (WCPMG) NMR experiment. 27Al chemical shifts and quadrupole tensor components offer a facile and clear distinction between three&#8208; and four&#8208;coordinate aluminum environments. For measuring internuclear Al&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;P distances a new resonance&#8208;echo saturation&#8208;pulse double&#8208;resonance (RESPDOR) experiment was developed by using efficient saturation via frequency&#8208;swept WURST pulses.

         <dc:description>
Being a good host: Metal phosphide&#8208;based hybrid materials have huge potential to boost the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8722;S batteries. This review presents a comprehensive overview of recent progress in the use of metal phosphides for advanced Li&#8722;S batteries, in particular with a focus on the modified approaches, design principles, representative applications and development direction.







Abstract
For the past few years, a new generation of energy storage systems with large theoretical specific capacity has been urgently needed because of the rapid development of society. Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries are regarded as one of the most promising candidates for novel battery systems, since their resurgence at the end of the 20th century Li&#8722;S batteries have attracted ever more attention, attributed to their notably high theoretical energy density of 2600&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;kg&#8722;1, which is almost five times larger than that of commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). One of the determining factors in Li&#8722;S batteries is how to design/prepare the sulfur cathode. For the sulfur host, the major technical challenge is avoiding the shuttling effect that is caused by soluble polysulfides during the reaction. In past decades, though the sulfur cathode has developed greatly, there are still some enormous challenges to be conquered, such as low utilization of S, rapid decay of capacity, and poor cycle life. This article spotlights the recent progress and foremost findings in improving the performance of Li&#8722;S batteries by employing multifunctional metal phosphides as host materials. The current state of development of the sulfur electrode of Li&#8722;S batteries is summarized by emphasizing the relationship between the essential properties of metal phosphide&#8208;based hybrid nanomaterials, the chemical reaction with lithium polysulfides and the latter&#8242;s influence on electrochemical performance. Finally, trends in the development and practical application of Li&#8722;S batteries are also pointed out.

         <title>Cascade Reaction to Selectively Synthesize Multifunctional Indole Derivatives by IrIII&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#8722;H activation cascade reaction: An effective way to synthesize a variety of functionalized indoles with potent biological properties has been developed. Notably, 2,4&#8208;dialkynyl indole products were obtained by direct double alkynylation of C&#8722;H bonds, whereas alkynyl on C4 position might convert to carbonyl to generate 2&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;diacetyl indoles. Additionally, relay catalysis allowed the synthesis of 2,5&#8208;di&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;diacetyl indoles by using an in&#8197;situ carbonyl group as the directing group.







Abstract
An effective and condition&#8208;controlled way to synthesize with high selectivity a variety of functionalized indoles with potent biological properties has been developed. Notably, 2,4&#8208;dialkynyl indole products were obtained by direct double C&#8722;H bond alkynylation, whereas alkynyl at the C4 position could convert to carbonyl to generate 2&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;diacetyl indoles fast and effectively. Additionally, a one&#8208;pot relay catalytic reaction led to 2,5&#8208;di&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;diacetyl indoles when using a carbonyl group as the directing group and by controlling the type and quantity of additives. A possible mechanism was proposed based on many studies including deuterium&#8208;exchange experiments, the necessary conditions of product conversion, and the effect of water on the reaction.

         <title>Binding Sites, Vibrations and Spin&#8208;Lattice Relaxation Times in Europium(II)&#8208;Based Metallofullerene Spin Qubits</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The investigation of the spin dynamics in a series of chemically designed europium(II)&#8208;based endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs) is reported. As a unique structural difference, metal&#8208;cage binding site can be introduced in EMFs and is demonstrated to play a key role in determining rigidity of the three low&#8208;energy metal&#8208;displacing vibrations and the spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times (T1). Normalized by the frequencies of these vibrations, the temperature dependence of T1 shows a universal behavior for different compounds in frozen CS2 solution.







Abstract
To design molecular spin qubits with enhanced quantum coherence, a control of the coupling between the local vibrations and the spin states is crucial, which could be realized in principle by engineering molecular structures via coordination chemistry. To this end, understanding the underlying structural factors that govern the spin relaxation is a central topic. Here, we report the investigation of the spin dynamics in a series of chemically designed europium(II)&#8208;based endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs). By introducing a unique structural difference, i.&#8201;e. metal&#8208;cage binding site, while keeping other molecular parameters constant between different complexes, these manifest the key role of the three low&#8208;energy metal&#8208;displacing vibrations in mediating the spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times (T1). The temperature dependence of T1 can thus be normalized by the frequencies of these low energy vibrations to show an unprecedentedly universal behavior for EMFs in frozen CS2 solution. Our theoretical analysis indicates that this structural difference determines not only the vibrational rigidity but also spin&#8208;vibration coupling in these EMF&#8208;based qubit candidates.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Space and time control: Light&#8208;induced mineralization of a barium carbonate/silica self&#8208;organized biomorph structure is possible by using the photobase ketoprofen through local pH increase and carbon dioxide release. Tuning the irradiation intensity or varying the irradiation time in subsequent growth cycles allows photochemical control of the morphology of the resulting structures. More information can be found in the Communication by J.&#8197;M. Garc&#237;a&#8208;Ruiz, H. C&#246;lfen, M. Montalti, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102321).

         <dc:description>Na  3  V  2  (PO  4  )  3  (NVP) has been regarded as a potential cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to its excellent structural stability and rapid Na  +  conductivity. However, its electrochemical performances are restricted by the large bulk structure and poor electronic conductivity. The construction of porous NVP materials is a powerful method to improve the electrochemical properties. This concept aims to provide an overview of recent progress of porous NVP materials for SIBs. In brief, we first review the synthetic strategies and formation mechanisms of porous NVP materials as well as the relationship between the porous structures and electrochemical performances of NVP materials. Furthermore, we outline the challenges and prospects for the preparation of porous NVP materials in this field.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To study the DNA damage caused by a potent platinum&#8211;acridine anticancer agent (PA) in cancer cells, an assay based on biorthogonal post&#8208;labeling using a click chemistry&#8208;enabled, azide&#8208;modified derivative (APA) was developed. The method involves biotinylation, affinity capture, and bead&#8208;based enrichment of APA&#8208;modified genomic DNA. The key steps of the assay were validated and optimized in model duplexes, including full&#8208;length plasmids, restriction fragments, and a DNA ladder.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To study the DNA damage caused by a potent platinum&#8211;acridine anticancer agent (PA) in cancer cells, an assay based on biorthogonal post-labeling using a click chemistry-enabled, azide-modified derivative (APA) was developed. The method involves biotinylation, affinity capture, and bead-based enrichment of APA-modified genomic DNA. The key steps of the assay were validated and optimized in model duplexes, including full-length plasmids, restriction fragments, and a DNA ladder. Native DNA treated with APA and subsequently subjected to post-labeling with a biotin affinity tag was enzymatically digested and fragments were analyzed by in-line LC-MS and MS/MS. The monofunctional&#8211;intercalative adducts formed by APA in 5&#180;-pyrimidine/guanine sequences in double-stranded DNA are quantitatively biotinylated by strain-promoted 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition chemistry. When applied to DNA extracted from A549 lung cancer cells, the assay in combination with qPCR amplification demonstrates that platinum&#8211;acridines form adducts in the gene sequences encoding pre-ribosomal RNA, a potential pharmacological target of these agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Using a combination of cycloaddition&#8208;retroelectrocyclization reaction, free&#8208;base and zinc porphyrins (H  2  P and ZnP) are decorated at their b&#8208;pyrrole positions with strong charge transfer complexes, viz., tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene (TCBD)&#8208;phenothiazine (  3  and  4  ) or TCBD&#8208;aniline (  7  and  8  ), novel class of push&#8208;pull systems.&#160; The physico&#8208;chemical properties of these compounds (MP&#8208;Donor and MP&#8208;TCBD&#8208;Donor) have been investigated using a range of electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical, DFT as well as steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic techniques.&#160; Ground&#8208;state charge transfer interactions between the porphyrin and the electron&#8208;withdrawing TCBD directly attached to the porphyrin p&#8208;system extended the absorption features well into the near&#8208;infrared region.&#160; To visualize the photo&#8208;events, energy level diagrams with the help of free&#8208;energy calculations have been established.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nowadays sodium&#8208;based energy storage systems (Na&#8208;based ESSs) have been widely researched as it possesses the possibility to replace traditional energy storage media to become next generation energy storage system. However, due to the irreversible loss of sodium ions in the first cycle, development of Na&#8208;based ESSs is limited. Presodiation, as a strategy of adding excess sodium ions to the system in advance, accomplishes the enhancement of electrochemical performance. In this minireview, different presodiation strategies applied in sodium&#8208;based energy storage systems will be summarized in detail, their functions and corresponding mechanisms will be discussed as well. Furthermore, the current novel application of presodiation method in other aspects of Na&#8208;based ESSs will be mentioned additionally. At last, in the view of present research status of presodiation, issues that can be mitigated are put forward and guidelines are given on  how to deliberate in&#8208;depth presodiation technology  in the future, dedicating to promote the further development of Na&#8208;based ESSs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven and room temperature photo&#8208;Wolff&#8208;Kischner reaction of sulfur ylides and N&#8208;tosylhydrazones has been developed for the first time to provide modular access to alkene synthesis. The high functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope were demonstrated by more than 60 examples. Both  E  &#8208; and  Z  &#8208;olefinic stereochemistry in the products could be controlled with excellent stereoselectivity. A series of mechanistic studies support that the reaction should proceed through a radical&#8208;carbanion crossover pathway, specifically involving addition of photo&#8208;generated sulfur ylide radical cations to  N  &#8208;tosylhydrazones to form carbanions and subsequent Wolff&#8208;Kischner process.</dc:description>

         <title>Contorted Hetero&#8208;annulated Tetraareno[a,d,j,m]coronenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fused polycyclic aromatic compounds are interesting materials for organic electronics applications. To fine&#8208;tune photophysical or electrochemical properties, either various substituents can be attached or heteroatoms (such as N or S) can be incorporated to the fused aromatic backbone. Coronenes and heterocoronenes are a promising compounds in this respect. Up to now, the possibilities to vary the attached fused heteroaromatics at the coronene core were quite limited and realizing both electron&#8208;withdrawing and &#8211;donating rings attached at the same time was very difficult. Here, a series of pyridine, anisole and thiophene annulated tetraareno[  a  ,  d  ,  j  ,  m  ]coronenes were synthesized by a facile two&#8208;step route, which is a combination of Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction and the following cyclization step, starting from three different diarenoperylene dibromides. The contorted molecular &#960;&#8208;planes of the obtained  cata  &#8208;condensed tetraarenocoronenes were analysed by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography and the photophysical and electrochemical properties were systematically investigated by UV(vis spectroscopiy and electrochemical characterizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Singlet Oxygen&#8208;Induced Phospholipase A2 Inhibition: a Major Role for Interfacial Tryptophan Dioxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several studies have revealed that various diseases such as cancer have been associated with elevated phospholipase A  2  (PLA  2  ) activity. Therefore, the regulation of PLA  2  catalytic activity is undoubtedly vital. In this study, effective inactivation of PLA  2  due to reactive species produced from cold physical plasma as a source to model oxidative stress is reported. We found singlet oxygen to be the most relevant active agent in PLA  2  inhibition. A more detailed analysis of the plasma&#8208;treated PLA  2  identified tryptophan 128 as a hot spot, rich in double oxidation. The significant dioxidation of this interfacial tryptophan resulted in an N&#8208;formylkynurenine product via the oxidative opening of the tryptophan indole ring. Molecular dynamics simulation indicated that the efficient interactions between the tryptophan residue and phospholipids are eliminated following tryptophan dioxidation. As interfacial tryptophan residues are predominantly involved in the attaching of membrane enzymes to the bilayers, tryptophan dioxidation and indole ring opening leads to the loss of essential interactions for enzyme binding and, consequently, enzyme inactivation.</dc:description>

         <title>Disclosure of Ground State Zimmerman&#8208;M&#246;bius Aromaticity in Radical Anion of [6]helicene and Evidence for 4p periodic Aromatic Ring Currents in a molecular &#8220;metallic&#8221; M&#246;bius Strip</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zimmerman proposed in 1966 a type of M&#246;bius aromaticity, which involves through&#8208;space electron delocalization and has since been widely applied to explain reactivity in pericyclic reactions, but is considered being limited to transition state structures. Although easily accessible hexahelicene radical anion is known for more than half a century, it was overlooked that it exhibits ground state minimum and robust Zimmerman&#8208;M&#246;bius aromaticity in its central noose&#8208;like opening, becoming, hence, the oldest existing M&#246;bius aromatic system and with smallest M&#246;bius cycle known. Despite its overall aromatic stabilization energy of 13.6 kcalmol&#8208;1 (at B3LYP/6&#8208;311+G**), the radical also features a strong global induced paramagnetic ring current along its outer edge. Exclusive global paramagnetic currents can be found also in fully delocalized other radical anions of 4N+2 p&#8208;electron aromatic polycyclic benzenoid hydrocarbons (PAH), questioning the established magnetic criterion of antiaromaticity. As an example for a PAH with non&#8208;trivial topology, we studied a novel M&#246;bius[16]cyclacene, which has a non&#8208;orientable surface manifold and a stable closed shell singlet ground state at several density functional theory levels. Its metallic monoanion radical (0.0095 eV band gap at HSE06/6&#8208;31G* level) is also wave function stable and displays an unusual 4p&#8208;periodic magnetically induced ring current (reminiscent of transformation behavior of spinors under spatial rotation), indicating existence of a H&#252;ckel rule evading new type of aromaticity.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Zimmerman proposed in 1966 a type of M&#246;bius aromaticity, which involves through-space electron delocalization and has since been widely applied to explain reactivity in pericyclic reactions, but is considered being limited to transition state structures. Although easily accessible hexahelicene radical anion is known for more than half a century, it was overlooked that it exhibits ground state minimum and robust Zimmerman-M&#246;bius aromaticity in its central noose-like opening, becoming, hence, the oldest existing M&#246;bius aromatic system and with smallest M&#246;bius cycle known. Despite its overall aromatic stabilization energy of 13.6 kcalmol-1 (at B3LYP/6-311+G**), the radical also features a strong global induced paramagnetic ring current along its outer edge. Exclusive global paramagnetic currents can be found also in fully delocalized other radical anions of 4N+2 p-electron aromatic polycyclic benzenoid hydrocarbons (PAH), questioning the established magnetic criterion of antiaromaticity. As an example for a PAH with non-trivial topology, we studied a novel M&#246;bius[16]cyclacene, which has a non-orientable surface manifold and a stable closed shell singlet ground state at several density functional theory levels. Its metallic monoanion radical (0.0095 eV band gap at HSE06/6-31G* level) is also wave function stable and displays an unusual 4p-periodic magnetically induced ring current (reminiscent of transformation behavior of spinors under spatial rotation), indicating existence of a H&#252;ckel rule evading new type of aromaticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanistic Aspects of the Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complexity of the Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura C&#8722;C bond formation reaction lies in the indivdual steps of the cycle, as well as in the generation of the catalytically active species. An overview of the topic is provided from a historical perspective.







Abstract
The story of C&#8722;C bond formation includes several reactions, and surely Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura is among the most outstanding ones. Herein, a brief historical overview of insights regarding the reaction mechanism is provided. In particular, the formation of the catalytically active species is probably the main concern, thus the preactivation is in competition with, or even assumes the role of the rate determining step (rds) of the overall reaction. Computational chemistry is key in identifying the rds and thus leading to milder conditions on an experimental level by means of predictive catalysis.

         <title>Photoswitchable Composite Polymer Electrolytes Using Spiropyran&#8208;Immobilized Nanoporous Templates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conductive solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) with smart, stimuli&#8208;responsive characteristics have gained considerable attention owing to their noninvasive manipulation and applications in future technologies. To address this potential, in this work, we demonstrate photoresponsive composite polymer electrolytes, consisting of SPE and spiropyran&#8208;immobilized nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide (SP&#8208;AAO) templates. Under UV irradiation, the close SP form isomerizes to the open merocyanine (MC) form, creating extremely polarized AAO surfaces; whereas under visible light irradiation, the MC form reverts to the SP form, creating neutral surface conditions. The electrostatic interactions between ions and AAO surfaces are investigated by attenuated total reflection Fourier&#8208;transform infrared (ATR&#8208;FTIR) spectroscopy. Moreover, the behavior of ionic conductivity of the SPE@SP&#8208;AAO is found to be consistent with the kinetics of isomerization tracked by UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy. This work provides a promising platform for developing next&#8208;generation photoelectronic smart devices.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Brightness Promoted by &#8220;Ring Fusion&#8221; for the Detection of Intestinal Inflammation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bright, even at longer wavelengths: A &#8220;ring&#8208;fusion&#8221; approach is proposed to adjust the emission wavelength from the NIR&#8208;I to NIR&#8208;II region with enhanced total brightness of the fluorophore. Theoretical calculation confirms that our strategy can efficiently narrow the energy gap and lower the reorganization energy of the TTQP molecule, promoting sensitive fluorescent angiography and diagnosis of intestinal inflammation. This molecular design strategy thus is promising to enrich the library of NIR&#8208;II fluorophores for versatile bioimaging studies.







Abstract
Fluorophores with emission in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) have displayed salient advantages for biomedical applications. However, the common strategy of reducing the energy bandgap of fluorophores so as to achieve red&#8208;shifted wavelengths always leads to compromised fluorescent brightness. Herein, we propose a molecular design concept of &#8220;ring&#8208;fusion&#8221; to modify the acceptor of AIEgen that can extend the luminous wavelength from NIR&#8208;I to NIR&#8208;II. The fused&#8208;acceptor&#8208;containing fluorophore yielded, TTQP, has an enhanced absorption coefficient with a higher brightness in nanoparticle formation compared to its NIR&#8208;I emissive counterpart (TTQ&#8208;DP) with a non&#8208;fused acceptor. Theoretical calculation further confirms that the ring fusion can efficiently promote the rigidity and planarity of the electron&#8208;deficient core, leading to a lower reorganization energy and nonradiative decay. The TTQP NPs yielded thus allow sensitive NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging of vasculature and intestinal inflammation in mice models. Therefore, we anticipate that our work will provide a promising molecular&#8208;engineering strategy to enrich the library and broaden the application scope of NIR&#8208;II fluorophores.

Greatness in simplicity: A general, straightforward, and atom&#8208;economical protocol to synthesize vinyl triflimides has been developed. A broad spectrum of terminal and internal alkynes could be used to generate various di&#8208; and trisubstituted vinyl triflimides. The protocol could be conducted on a gram scale with both terminal and internal alkynes. Preliminarily attempts to probe the unprecedented reactivity of vinyl triflimides disclosed some of its unique chemical properties. More information can be found in the Communication by Y.

         <title>Highly Sensitive Fluorescent pH Microsensors Based on the Ratiometric Dye Pyranine Immobilized on Silica Microparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optical fluorescent pH sensors based on positively charged silica microparticles containing anionic pyranine molecules were developed by using a modified St&#246;ber method with a gradual immobilization of ratiometrically pH&#8208;sensing pyranine molecules during the growth of silica seed particles and an overall positive charge in a one&#8208;step reaction. The overly pH&#8208;sensitive nature of pyranine is preserved and long&#8208;term stability is ensured by silica shell coating.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Optical fluorescent pH sensors based on positively charged silica microparticles&lt;/b&gt; containing anionic pyranine molecules were developed by using a modified St&#246;ber method with a gradual immobilization of ratiometrically pH-sensing pyranine molecules during the growth of silica seed particles and an overall positive charge in a one-step reaction. The overly pH-sensitive nature of pyranine is preserved and long-term stability is ensured by silica shell coating. These cytocompatible ratiometric pH sensors can be used for pH sensing and pH tracking applications where each microparticle can be observed individually due to resolvable size.

Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are Anil Chandra, Loretta&#8197;L. del&#8197;Mercato and co&#8208;workers at the Institute of Nanotechnology of National Research Council and the University of Salento. The image depicts how negatively charged pH&#8208;sensitive pyranine (HPTS) molecules were successfully immobilized on silica microparticles (SMPs) without compromising the molecules&#8242; pH sensitivity. These resulting sensors can be used to measure pH in vitro and in vivo due to the cytocompatibility of HPTS molecules and SMPs. Read the full text of the article at 10.1002/chem.202101568.

         <title>Non&#8208;conventional Behavior of a 2,1&#8208;Benzazaphosphole: Heterodiene or Hidden Phosphinidene?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;The dual behavior of the 2,1&#8208;benzazaphosphole mentioned in the title of this manuscript predicted by a theoretical NRT study represents the most significant point of this paper. Thus, a quite easily accessible molecule allowed us to observe two totally different reactivities; i.e., heterodyne&#8208; versus phosphinidene&#8208;like, both of them being highly desirable regarding future applications.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff.

         <title>Re&#8208;Thinking Uncaging: A New Antiaromatic Photocage Driven by a Gain of Resonance Energy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoactivatable compounds  e.g.  photoswitches or photolabile protecting groups (PPGs, photocages) for spatiotemporal light control, play a crucial role in different areas of research. For each application, parameters such as the absorption spectrum, solubility in the respective media and/or photochemical quantum yields for several competing processes need to be optimized. The design of new photochemical tools therefore remains an important task. In this study, we exploited the concept of excited&#8208;state&#8208;aromaticity, first described by N. Colin Baird in 1971, to investigate a new class of photocages, based on cyclic, ground&#8208;state&#8208;antiaromatic systems. Several thio&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;functionalized compounds were synthesized, photochemically characterized and further optimized, supported by quantum chemical calculations. After choosing the optimal scaffold, which shows an excellent uncaging quantum yield of 28%, we achieved a bathochromic shift of over 100 nm, resulting in a robust, well accessible, visible light absorbing, compact new photocage with a clean photoreaction and a high quantum product (&#949;&#183;&#934;) of 893 M  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;1  at 405&#160;nm.</dc:description>

After choosing the optimal scaffold, which shows an excellent uncaging quantum yield of 28%, we achieved a bathochromic shift of over 100 nm, resulting in a robust, well accessible, visible light absorbing, compact new photocage with a clean photoreaction and a high quantum product (&#949;&#183;&#934;) of 893 M  -1  cm  -1  at 405&#160;nm.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Oxygen and Hydrogen Functionalization of the h&#8208;BN/Rh(111) Nanomesh</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Confined functionalization: In this study, we achieved covalent functionalization of the hexagonal boron nitride nanomesh on Rh(111) with oxygen molecules and hydrogen atoms. The adsorption and thermal stability were investigated using synchrotron radiation&#8208;based in&#8197;situ high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, temperature&#8208;programmed X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. It was found that the functionalization is restricted to the pores of the nanomesh leading to spatially defined chemical modification of the two&#8208;dimensional material.







Abstract
We present detailed studies on the covalent adsorption of molecular oxygen and atomic hydrogen on the hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) nanomesh on Rh(111). The functionalization of this two&#8208;dimensional (2D) material was investigated under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions using synchrotron radiation&#8208;based in&#8197;situ high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, temperature&#8208;programmed X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. We are able to provide a deep insight into the adsorption behavior and thermal stability of oxygen and hydrogen on h&#8208;BN/Rh(111). Oxygen functionalization was achieved via a supersonic molecular beam while hydrogen functionalization was realized using an atomic hydrogen source. Adsorption of the respective species was observed to occur selectively in the pores of h&#8208;BN leading to spatially defined modification of the 2D layer. The adsorption of the observed molecular oxygen species was found to be an activated process that requires high&#8208;energy oxygen molecules. Upon heating to 700&#8197;K, oxygen functionalization was observed to be almost reversible except for small amounts of boron oxides evolving due to the reaction of oxygen with the 2D material. Hydrogen functionalization of h&#8208;BN/Rh(111) was fully reversed upon heating to about 640&#8197;K.

         <title>Divergent Construction of Diverse Scaffolds through Catalyst&#8208;Controlled C&#8722;H Activation Cascades of Quinazolinones and Cyclopropenones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled cascades: We have successfully developed attractive C&#8722;H activation cascade reactions between quinazolinones and cyclopropenones. Different structures can be selectively synthesized under the precise control of the catalysts in a one&#8208;pot manner. The high efficiency, excellent chemo&#8208;/regioselectivity, wide substrate scope, and amenability to gram&#8208;scale synthesis for both quinazolinones and cyclopropenones demonstrated the promising applicability of reactions.







Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation cascade strategy to rapidly construct diverse quinazolinone derivatives in a one&#8208;pot manner is reported. The catalysts play an important role in the different transformations. Additionally, the procedure is scalable, proceeds with high efficiency and good chemo&#8208;/regio&#8208;selectivity, and tolerates a range of functional groups.

         <title>Cation Ordering and Exsolution in Copper&#8208;Containing Forms of the Flexible Zeolite Rho (Cu,M&#8208;Rho; M=H, Na) and Their Consequences for CO2 Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper cations favour 6&#8208;membered ring (6R) sites in dehydrated zeolite Rho, away from 8R windows that allow adsorption into lta cages. Exchange of Cu cations into Na&#8208;Rho, in which Na cations occupy 8R gating sites between the lta cages, improves CO2 uptake kinetics, while retaining some Na cations enhances CO2/CH4 selectivity. Upon dehydration, Cu,Na&#8208;Rho shows exsolution behaviour, because its framework can adopt distorted and undistorted forms that provide favourable coordination sites for Na and Cu cations, respectively.







Abstract
The flexibility of the zeolite Rho framework offers great potential for tunable molecular sieving. The fully copper&#8208;exchanged form of Rho and mixed Cu,H&#8208; and Cu,Na&#8208;forms have been prepared. EPR spectroscopy reveals that Cu2+ ions are present in the dehydrated forms and Rietveld refinement shows these prefer S6R sites, away from the d8r windows that control diffusion. Fully exchanged Cu&#8208;Rho remains in an open form upon dehydration, the d8r windows remain nearly circular and the occupancy of window sites is low, so that it adsorbs CO2 rapidly at room temperature. Breakthrough tests with 10&#8201;% CO2/40&#8201;% CH4 mixtures show that Cu4.9&#8208;Rho is able to produce pure methane, albeit with a relatively low capacity at this pCO2 due to the weak interaction of CO2 with Cu cations. This is in strong contrast to Na&#8208;Rho, where cations in narrow elliptical window sites enable CO2 to be adsorbed with high selectivity and uptake but too slowly to enable the production of pure methane in similar breakthrough experiments. A series of Cu,Na&#8208;Rho materials was prepared to improve uptake and selectivity compared to Cu&#8208;Rho, and kinetics compared to Na&#8208;Rho. Remarkably, Cu,Na&#8208;Rho with &gt;2 Cu cations per unit cell exhibited exsolution, due to the preference of Na cations for narrow S8R sites in distorted Rho and of Cu cations for S6R sites in the centric, open form of Rho. The exsolved Cu,Na&#8208;Rho showed improved performance in CO2/CH4 breakthrough tests, producing pure CH4 with improved uptake and CO2/CH4 selectivity compared to that of Cu4.9&#8208;Rho.

         <title>Effect of Heterometal&#8208;Functionalization and Template Exchange on the Redox Chemistry of Molecular Vanadium Oxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substitution effect: Electrochemical structure&#8208;property relationships are reported for a metal&#8208;functionalized dodecavanadate cluster. To this end, the effects of heterometal substitution and template exchange on the redox properties are studied. The type of heterometal and the resulting structural distortion of the cluster shell are main factors controlling the cluster properties, while the redox potentials correlate with the overall cluster charge. Exchange of the template anion from chloride to bromide shows no major effect.







Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) have emerged as material of interest in many applications such as energy storage and conversion due to their redox activity and molecularly defined structure. However, especially for polyoxovanadates a lack of understanding between structural modifications and physicochemical properties remains. The present study leverages a lacunary dodecavanadate to systematically investigate the electronic effect of heterometal functionalization. While structural distortion affects the stability of the cluster, the redox potentials correlate with the overall cluster charge. Furthermore, we report the first bromide&#8208;templated analogue of this cluster family. While the halide anion is crucial for the formation of the cluster, no major effect on the electrochemical properties is observed. By improving the understanding of structure&#8208;property relationship in this work, we hope to enable a more predictable tuning of redox&#8208;properties of polyoxovandates.

         <title>Redox Isomerism in the S3 State of the Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Complex Resolved by Coupled Cluster Theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The domain&#8208;based local pair natural orbital&#8211;coupled cluster approach, DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T), was employed to obtain reliable relative energetics for distinct redox&#8208;isomeric forms of the Mn4Ca cofactor of the oxygen&#8208;evolving complex of photosystem&#8197;II in its final metastable S3 state. It is shown that the MnIV4 oxo&#8208;hydroxo model is significantly more stable than the MnIII2MnIV2 peroxo model, thus disfavoring the scenario of early&#8208;onset O&#8722;O bond formation in biological water oxidation.

The electronic and geometric structures of the water&#8208;oxidizing complex of photosystem II in the steps of the catalytic cycle that precede dioxygen evolution remain hotly debated. Recent structural and spectroscopic investigations support contradictory redox formulations for the active&#8208;site Mn4CaOx cofactor in the final metastable S3 state. These range from the widely accepted MnIV4 oxo&#8208;hydroxo model, which presumes that O&#8722;O bond formation occurs in the ultimate transient intermediate (S4) of the catalytic cycle, to a MnIII2MnIV2 peroxo model representative of the contrasting &#8220;early&#8208;onset&#8221; O&#8722;O bond formation hypothesis. Density functional theory energetics of suggested S3 redox isomers are inconclusive because of extreme functional dependence. Here, we use the power of the domain&#8208;based local pair natural orbital approach to coupled cluster theory, DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T), to present the first correlated wave function theory calculations of relative stabilities for distinct redox&#8208;isomeric forms of the S3 state. Our results enabled us to evaluate conflicting models for the S3 state of the oxygen&#8208;evolving complex (OEC) and to quantify the accuracy of lower&#8208;level theoretical approaches. Our assessment of the relevance of distinct redox&#8208;isomeric forms for the mechanism of biological water oxidation strongly disfavors the scenario of early&#8208;onset O&#8722;O formation advanced by literal interpretations of certain crystallographic models. This work serves as a case study in the application of modern coupled cluster implementations to redox isomerism problems in oligonuclear transition metal systems.

         <title>Imidazolium&#8208;Functionalized Chemically Robust Ionic Porous Organic Polymers (iPOPs) toward Toxic Oxo&#8208;Pollutants Capture from Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An example of utilization of imidazole&#8208;functionalized chemically robust cationic porous organic polymers (POPs) for rapid and efficient capture of hazardous dual oxo&#8208;anionic pollutants from water. The study will enrich the concept of designing new efficient cationic polymeric materials to tackle the problems based on water pollution, one of the most important threats towards the initiative for a green and clean environment.







Abstract
Fabricating new and efficient materials aimed at containment of water contamination, in particular removing toxic heavy metal based oxo&#8208;anions (e.&#8201;g. CrO42&#8722;, TcO4&#8722;) holds paramount importance. In this work, we report two new highly stable imidazolium based ionic porous organic polymers (iPOPs) decorated with multiple interaction sites along with electrostatics driven adsorptive removal of such oxo&#8208;anions from water. Both the iPOPs (namely, iPOP&#8208;3 and iPOP&#8208;4) exhibited rapid sieving kinetics and very high saturation uptake capacity for CrO42&#8722; anions (170 and 141&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 for iPOP&#8208;3 and iPOP&#8208;4 respectively) and ReO4&#8722; (515.5 and 350.3&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 for iPOP&#8208;3 and iPOP&#8208;4 respectively), where ReO4&#8722; anions being the non&#8208;radioactive surrogative counterpart of radioactive TcO4&#8722; ions. Noticeably, both iPOPs showed exceptional selectivity towards CrO42&#8722; and ReO4&#8722; even in presence of several other concurrent anions such as Br&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, SO42&#8722;, NO3&#8722; etc. The theoretical binding energy calculations via DFT method further confirmed the preferential interaction sites as well as binding energies of both iPOPs towards CrO42&#8722; and ReO4&#8722; over all other competing anions which corroborates with the experimental high capacity and selectivity of iPOPs toward such oxo&#8208;anions.

         <title>Noncovalent Interactions at Lanthanide Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthanide complexes have attracted a widespread attention due to their structural diversity, as well as multifunctional and tunable properties. The development of lanthanide based functional materials has often relied on the design of the secondary coordination sphere of the corresponding lanthanide complexes. For instance, usually simple lanthanide salts (solvento complexes) do not catalyze effectively organic reactions or provide low yield of the expected product, whereas the presence of a suitable organic ligand with a noncovalent bond donor or acceptor centre (secondary coordination sphere) modifies the symmetry around the metal centre in lanthanide complexes which then successfully can act as catalysts in both homogenous and heterogenous catalysis. In this minireview, we discuss several relevant examples, based on X&#8208;ray crystal structure analyses, in which the hydrogen, halogen, chalcogen, pnictogen, tetrel and rare&#8208;earth bonds, as well as cation&#8208;&#960;, anion&#8208;&#960;, lone pair&#8208;&#960;, &#960;&#8208;&#960; and pancake interactions, are used as a synthon in the decoration of the secondary coordination sphere of lanthanide complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Breathing Effect via Solvent Inclusions on the Linker Rotational Dynamics of Functionalized MIL&#8208;53</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The breathing effects of functionalized MIL&#8208;53&#8208;X (X= H, CH  3  , NH  2  , OH, and NO  2  ) induced by the inclusions of water, methanol, acetone, and N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide solvents were comprehensively investigated by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. 2D homo&#8208;nuclear correlation NMR provided direct experimental evidence for the host&#8208;guest interaction between the guest solvents and the MOFs framework. The variations of the  1  H and  13  C NMR chemical shifts in functionalized MIL&#8208;53 from the narrow pore phase transitions to large pore forms due to solvent inclusions were clearly identified. The influence of functionalized linkers and their host&#8208;guest interactions with the confined solvents on the rotational dynamics of the linkers was examined by separated&#8208;local&#8208;field MAS NMR experiments in conjunction with DFT theoretical calculations. It is found that the linker rotational dynamics of functionalized MIL&#8208;53 in narrow pore form is closely related to the computational rotational energy barrier. The BDC&#8208;NO  2  linker of activated MIL&#8208;53&#8208;NO  2  undergoes relatively faster rotation, whereas the BDC&#8208;NH  2  and BDC&#8208;OH linkers of activated MIL&#8208;53&#8208;NH  2  and MIL&#8208;53&#8208;OH exhibit relatively slower rotation. The host&#8208;guest interactions between confined solvents and MIL&#8208;53&#8208;NO  2  , MIL&#8208;53&#8208;CH  3  would significantly induce an increase of the order parameters of unsubstituted carbon and reduce the rotational frequency of linkers. This study provides a spectroscopic approach for the investigation of linker rotation in functionalized MOFs at natural abundance with solvents inclusions.</dc:description>

         <title>Hexaphenylditetrels &#8211; When Longer Bonds Provide Higher Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;Carbon bonds are exceptional as demonstrated for the hexaphenylditetrels where attractive London dispersion interactions are the decisive factor for the thermodynamic stabilities of tetrels other than carbon. Structural and energetic comparisons show that even though hexaphenylethane displays the largest dispersion energy between the two molecular halves, it has remained elusive because of even larger Pauli repulsion of the phenyl moieties that are forced in close contact due to the C&#8722;C bond that is the shortest in this series.







Abstract
We present a computational analysis of hexaphenylethane derivatives with heavier tetrels comprising the central bond. In stark contrast to parent hexaphenylethane, the heavier tetrel derivatives can readily be prepared. In order to determine the origin of their apparent thermodynamic stability against dissociation as compared to the carbon case, we employed local energy decomposition analysis (LED) and symmetry&#8208;adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) at the DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T)/def2&#8208;TZVP and sSAPT0/def2&#8208;TZVP levels of theory. We identified London dispersion (LD) interactions as the decisive factor for the molecular stability of heavier tetrel derivatives. This stability is made possible owing to the longer (than C&#8722;C) central bonds that move the phenyl groups out of the heavily repulsive regime so they can optimally benefit from LD interactions.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Promoted N&#8208;Arylation of the Imidazole Side Chain of Protected Histidine by Using Triarylbismuth Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fine transfer protocol: A method for the N&#8208;arylation of protected histidine using triarylbismuth reagents is reported. The reaction is promoted by copper diacetate and proceeds under smooth conditions, allowing the transfer of aryl groups on the distal nitrogen of the imidazole ring. A histidine&#8208;directed backbone N&#8722;H arylation was observed at the n&#8208;1 position of histidine&#8208;containing dipeptides.







Abstract
The N&#8208;arylation of the side chain of histidine by using triarylbismuthines is reported. The reaction is promoted by copper(II) acetate in dichloromethane at 40&#8201;&#176;C under oxygen in the presence of diisopropylethylamine and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline and allows the transfer of aryl groups with substituents at any position of the aromatic ring. The reaction shows excellent functional group tolerance and is applicable to dipeptides where the histidine is located at the N terminus. A histidine&#8208;guided backbone N&#8722;H arylation was observed in dipeptides where the histidine occupies the C terminus.

         <title>Covalent Patterning of 2D MoS2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The patterned 2D MoS2 surface was achieved through covalent functionalization of electron beam lithography (EBL) defined guiding areas. The patterned MoS2 surface displays switchable surface characteristics in a spatially defined manner, confirmed by scanning Raman spectroscopy and PL mapping, which may hold great promise for the development of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electronic and optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
The development of an efficient method to patterning 2D MoS2 into a desired topographic structure is of particular importance to bridge the way towards the ultimate device. Herein, we demonstrate a patterning strategy by combining the electron beam lithography with the surface covalent functionalization. This strategy allows us to generate delicate MoS2 ribbon patterns with a minimum feature size of 2&#8197;&#956;m in a high throughput rate. The patterned monolayer MoS2 domain consists of a spatially well&#8208;defined heterophase homojunction and alternately distributed surface characteristics, which holds great interest for further exploration of MoS2 based devices.

Ball and chain: The Pd8 strings supported by the linear tetraphosphines meso&#8208; and rac&#8208;dpmppm, [Pd8(meso&#8208; or rac&#8208;dpmppm)4(L)2](BF4)4 trap a C60 or C70 fullerene molecule in the central Pd&#8211;Pd junction, exclusively affording the unprecedented metal&#8208;chain&#8208;wired bucky balls, [{Pd4(meso&#8208; or rac&#8208;dpmppm)2(L)}2(C60 or 70)]X4 (L=CH3CN, XylNC; X=TfO, BF4), through chirality&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly.







Abstract
Reactions of Pd8 strings supported by meso&#8208;Ph2PCH2P(Ph)CH2P(Ph)CH2PPh2 (meso&#8208;dpmppm) ligands, [Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(L)2]4+ (L=CH3CN (1), XylNC (2)) with C60 resulted in the exclusive formation of unprecedented metal&#8208;chain&#8208;wired C60 bucky balls, [{Pd4(meso&#8208;dpmppm)2(L)}2(C60)]4+ (L=CH3CN (11), XylNC (12)), in which a C60 fullerene is trapped in the central Pd&#8211;Pd junction, as unambiguously established by spectroscopic, X&#8208;ray crystallographic, and theoretical techniques. The similar reaction of Pd8 strings supported by rac&#8208;dpmppm, [Pd8(rac&#8208;dpmppm)4(CH3CN)2]4+ (3) also afforded a racemic mixture of [{Pd4((R*,R*)&#8208;dpmppm)2(CH3CN)}2(C60)]4+ (13) without scrambling the Pd4 fragments with (R,R)&#8208; and (S,S)&#8208;dpmppm ligands. Consequently, those of enantiopure chiral Pd8 strings, [Pd8((R*,R*)&#8208;dpmppm)4(CH3CN)2]4+, certainly afforded chiral bucky balls of [{Pd4((R*,R*)&#8208;dpmppm)2(CH3CN)}2(C60)]4+ (13RR and 13SS), that exhibit mirror&#8208;image circular dichroism spectra. The reactions of 1 and 2 were also applied for trapping a C70 fullerene to give 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 adducts of [{Pd4(meso&#8208;dpmppm)2(L)}2(C70)]4+ (L=CH3CN (21), XylNC (22)). These results provide useful information for creating a platform to develop dimensionally and chirality controlled metal&#8211;carbon nanocomposite materials.

         <title>Hollow carbon spheres&#8208;modified graphitic carbon nitride for efficient photocatalytic H2 production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel hybrid photocatalyst composed of nano hollow carbon spheres (NCS) and graphitic carbon nitride (CN) curly nanosheets has been prepared by the calcination of NCS precursor and freeze&#8208;dried urea. The optimized photocatalyst exhibits an efficient photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation with the highest H  2  generation rate of 3612.3 &#956;mol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  , leading to an apparent quantum yield of 10.04% at 420 nm, 5 times higher than the widely reported benchmark photocatalyst CN (2.01% AQY). The materials characterization shows that NCS&#8208;modified CN curly nanosheets can promote photoelectron transfer and suppress charge recombination through their special coupling interface and NCS as an electron acceptor, which significantly improves the photocatalytic efficiency. Thus, this study provides a new strategy for the design of highly&#8208;efficient photocatalyst, particularly suitable for polymeric materials to construct a totally metal free photocatalytic structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of N&#8208;Substituents on Photovoltaic Properties of Singly Bay&#8208;Linked Dimeric Perylene Diimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The influence of  N  &#8208;substituents on the photovoltaic properties of singly bay&#8208;linked perylene diimides (diPDIs) was systematically investigated to understand the aromatic&#8211;aliphatic balance, which is beneficial for achieving high device performance in organic photovoltaic (OPV) systems. The synthesis of various  N  &#8208;substituted diPDIs was successfully achieved using a newly developed one&#8208;step procedure, resulting in sufficiently high yields. Detailed investigations of seven variants of diPDIs demonstrated that the primary alkyl substituents, particularly the 2&#8208;ethylhexyl group, induce the self&#8208;organized growth of thin films with high crystallinity. This is beneficial for enhancing the device performance of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) systems. The results presented herein reveal the important roles of alkyl side chains as hydrophobic solubilizing auxiliaries or primary determinants in the control of the active layer nanomorphology. This offers a valuable guideline that is essential for developing high&#8208;performance organic semiconductor materials for future practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Stability of AgIII towards Halides in Organosilver(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unexpectedly robust: We provide theoretical evidence and experimental proof of the unexpected stability of the AgIII&#8722;X bond with every halogen (X=F, Cl, Br and I) in the series of square&#8208;planar organosilver(III) derivatives [PPh4][(CF3)3AgX]. Unimolecular decomposition paths were analyzed by combined theoretical and experimental methods, whereby the two series of linear complexes [CF3AgX]&#8722; and [FAgX]&#8722; were detected. The first silver(III) azide was also prepared, isolated and structurally characterized.







Abstract
The involvement of silver in two&#8208;electron AgI/AgIII processes is currently emerging. However, the range of stability of the required and uncommon AgIII species is virtually unknown. Here, the stability of AgIII towards the whole set of halide ligands in the organosilver(III) complex frame [(CF3)3AgX]&#8722; (X=F, Cl, Br, I, At) is theoretically analyzed. The results obtained depend on a single factor: the nature of X. Even the softest and least electronegative halides (I and At) are found to form reasonably stable AgIII&#8722;X bonds. Our estimates were confirmed by experiment. The whole series of nonradiative halide complexes [PPh4][(CF3)3AgX] (X=F, Cl, Br, I) has been experimentally prepared and all its constituents have been isolated in pure form. The pseudohalides [PPh4][(CF3)3AgCN] and [PPh4][(CF3)3Ag(N3)] have also been isolated, the latter being the first silver(III) azido complex. Except for the iodo compound, all the crystal and molecular structures have been established by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction methods. The decomposition paths of the [(CF3)3AgX]&#8722; entities at the unimolecular level have been examined in the gas phase by multistage mass spectrometry (MSn). The experimental detection of the two series of mixed complexes [CF3AgX]&#8722; and [FAgX]&#8722; arising from the corresponding parent species [(CF3)3AgX]&#8722; demonstrate that the Ag&#8722;X bond is particularly robust. Our experimental observations are rationalized with the aid of theoretical methods. Smooth variation with the electronegativity of X is also observed in the thermolyses of bulk samples. The thermal stability in the solid state gradually decreases from X=F (145&#8201;&#176;C, dec.) to X=I (78&#8201;&#176;C, dec.) The experimentally established compatibility of AgIII with the heaviest halides is of particular relevance to silver&#8208;mediated or silver&#8208;catalyzed processes.

         <title>Non&#8208;conventional Behavior of a 2,1&#8208;Benzazaphosphole: Heterodiene or Hidden Phosphinidene?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a Natural Resonance Theory study, 2,1&#8208;benzazaphosphole exhibits a dualistic behavior and can serve as a heterodiene or a hidden phosphinidene. This intriguing property has been confirmed chemically. It is able to react with established dienophiles via hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, thereby forming new heterocyclic compounds, but it also donates two transition metals as a 4e ligand, thus mimicking a phosphinidene character. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Z. Benk&#337;, L. Dost&#225;l, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101686).

         <title>Ni(II) Precatalysts Enable Thioetherification of (Hetero)Aryl Halides and Tosylates and Tandem C&#8722;S/C&#8722;N Couplings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Competent partners: &#960;&#8208;Allyl&#8211;nickel precatalysts supported by dialkylterphenyl phosphines efficiently couple a wide range of electrophiles including aryl iodides/bromides/chlorides and, for the first time, aryl and alkenyl tosylates with aromatic and aliphatic thiols. In addition, tandem C&#8722;S and C&#8722;N coupling of multi&#8208;electrophile/nucleophile combinations is achieved in a completely chemoselective manner leading to highly functionalized products.

         <title>Design of Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Dynamic Covalent Delivery Systems for Volatile Compounds (Part&#8197;2): Fragrance&#8208;Releasing Cleavable Surfactants in Functional Perfumery Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imine&#8208;based cleavable surfactant profragrances assemble into micelles that allow solubilization of perfume molecules that are not covalently attached to the surfactant. Formulated systems were found to be stable during storage and released a fragrance aldehyde upon hydrolysis while providing a balanced evaporation of co&#8208;solubilized perfumery molecules.







Abstract
Amphiphilic imines prepared by condensation of a hydrophobic fragrance aldehyde with a hydrophilic amine derived from a poly(propylene oxide) and poly(ethylene oxide) diblock copolymer were investigated as cleavable surfactant profragrances in applications of functional perfumery. In water, the cleavable surfactants assemble into micelles that allow solubilization of perfume molecules that are not covalently attached to the surfactant. Dynamic headspace analysis on a glass surface showed that solubilized perfume molecules evaporated in a similar manner in the presence of the cleavable surfactant as compared with a non&#8208;cleavable reference surfactant. Under application conditions, the cleavable surfactant imine hydrolysed to release the covalently linked fragrance aldehyde. The profragrances were stable during storage in aqueous media, and upon dilution showed a blooming effect for the hydrolytical fragrance release and a more balanced performance of a solubilized perfume by retaining the more volatile fragrances and boosting the evaporation of the less volatile fragrances.

         <title>Type&#8208;II Clathrate Na24&#8208;&#948;Ge136 from a Redox&#8208;Preparation Route</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The so far hardly accessible type&#8208;II clathrate Na24&#8208;&#948;Ge136 (&#948;&#8776;2) was obtained in an about 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mass ratio with &#945;&#8208;Ge from Na12Ge17 by redox reaction with benzophenone and subsequent heat treatment of the widely X&#8208;ray amorphous intermediate. The phase is room&#8208;temperature transient, diamagnetic and shows metallic properties as revealed by Knight&#8208;shifted 23Na NMR signals and a Pauli&#8208;paramagnetic contribution to the magnetic susceptibility.







Abstract
The metastable type&#8208;II clathrate Na24&#8208;&#948;Ge136 was obtained from Na12Ge17 by applying a two&#8208;step procedure. At first, Na12Ge17 was reacted at 70&#8201;&#176;C with a solution of benzophenone in the ionic liquid (IL) 1,3&#8208;dibutyl&#8208;2&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) azanide. The IL was inert towards Na12Ge17, but capable of dissolving the sodium salts formed in the redox reaction. By annealing at 340&#8201;&#176;C under an argon atmosphere, the X&#8208;ray amorphous intermediate product was transformed to crystalline Na24&#8208;&#948;Ge136 (&#948;&#8776;2) and &#945;&#8208;Ge in an about 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mass ratio. The product was characterized by X&#8208;ray powder diffraction, chemical analysis, and 23Na solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. Metallic properties of Na24&#8208;&#948;Ge136 were revealed by a significant Knight shift of the 23Na NMR signals and by a Pauli&#8208;paramagnetic contribution to the magnetic susceptibility. At room temperature, Na24&#8208;&#948;Ge136 slowly ages, with a tendency to volume decrease and sodium loss.

         <title>Molecular Cage Assembly by Sn&#8722;O&#8722;Sn Bridging of Di&#8208;, Tri&#8208; and Tetranuclear Organotin Tectons: Extending the Spacing in Double Ladder Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a cooperative effort between research groups from Dortmund (Germany, coat of arms on the left) and Cuernavaca (Morelos, M&#233;xico, coat of arms on the right), novel molecular cages were synthesized and characterized by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art analytical methods and DFT calculations. Among these novel compounds, the spacer&#8208;bridged tetraorganodistannoxane in the centre showing a double&#8208;ladder structure exhibits a record spacing between the opposite tin centres. More information can be found in the Communication by K. Jurkschat, H. H&#246;pfl, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101055).

         <title>Bidentate Disilicate Framework for Bis&#8208;Grafted Surface Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grafting of a platinum precursor bearing a disilicate ligand, &#8722;OSi(OtBu)2OSi(OtBu)2O&#8722;, achieved the selective formation of bis&#8208;grafted surface species on silica supports. The chemical&#8208;shift values of the ancillary ligands were almost identical before and after the grafting, thus suggesting that the coordination sphere around platinum of the grafted species was nearly independent of the type of silica support and the degree of substitution on the disilicate ligand. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8208;C. Choi et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101927).

In this image, a golden compass guides the adventurer's way in an unknown chemical space. The compass leads the structures with one&#8208; and two&#8208;dimensional content towards those with an increased three&#8208;dimensional character. These three&#8208;dimensional compounds rise towards uncharted chemical space leaving the flatland behind, based on the cascade cyclization of alkynyl azides generating indole fused medium&#8208;sized rings.

         <title>Design of Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Dynamic Covalent Delivery Systems for Volatile Compounds (Part&#8197;1): Controlled Hydrolysis of Micellar Amphiphilic Imines in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imines are hydrolytically unstable, but can be stabilized in aqueous media by self&#8208;assembly in micellar structures. Parameters such as pH, concentration, position of the imine function in the amphiphilic structure and relative lengths of the linked hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties affect the stability of the imine bond and can be adapted to form stimuli&#8208;responsive micelles suitable for controlling the release of bioactive volatiles.







Abstract
Despite their intrinsic hydrolysable character, imine bonds can become remarkably stable in water when self&#8208;assembled in amphiphilic micellar structures. In this work, we systematically studied some of these structures and the influence of various parameters that can be used to take control of their hydrolysis, including pH, concentration, the position of the imine function in the amphiphilic structure, relative lengths of the linked hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties. Thermodynamic and kinetic data led us to the rational design of stable imines in water, partly based on the location of the imine function within the hydrophobic part of the amphiphile and on a predictable quantitative term that we define as the total hydrophilic&#8211;lipophilic balance (HLB). In addition, we show that such stable systems are also stimuli&#8208;responsive and therefore, of potential interest in trapping and releasing micellar components on demand.

         <title>Phosphate&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Immolative Linkers for Tuneable Double Cargo Release</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorus&#8208;based self&#8208;immolative linkers activated by light sequentially release two phenolic cargos. Structurally modifying the lactate spacer responsible for self&#8208;immolation allows adjustable cargo release, ranging from minutes to days. The cargo release rate can be additionally tuned by varying the cargos. NMR spectroscopy coupled to UV light illumination enabled us to track and characterize products released during the self&#8208;immolation process. More information can be found in the Full Paper by E. Proch&#225;zkov&#225;, O. Baszczy&#328;ski, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101805).

         <title>Engineered Cyclotides with Potent Broad in Vitro and in Vivo Antimicrobial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cyclotide is turning: By using a topologically modified sequence of protegrin PG&#8208;1, novel cyclotides were engineered with effective broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity against several ESKAPE bacterial strains and clinical isolates. The most active antibacterial cyclotide showed little hemolytic activity and was extremely stable in serum. In addition, this cyclotide was able to provide protection in&#8197;vivo in a murine P. aeruginosa&#8208;induced peritonitis model.







Abstract
The search for novel antimicrobial agents to combat microbial pathogens is intensifying in response to the rapid development of drug resistance to current antibiotic therapeutics. Respiratory failure and septicemia are the leading causes of mortality among hospitalized patients. Here, the development of a novel engineered cyclotide with effective broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity against several ESKAPE bacterial strains and clinical isolates is reported. The most active antibacterial cyclotide was extremely stable in serum, showed little hemolytic activity, and provided protection in&#8197;vivo in a murine model of P. aeruginosa peritonitis. These results highlight the potential of the cyclotide scaffold for the development of novel antimicrobial therapeutic leads for the treatment of bacteremia.

         <title>THE CATALYTIC MECHANISM OF THE RETAINING GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE MANNOSYLGLYCERATE SYNTHASE</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To protect their intracellular proteins, extremophile microorganisms synthesize molecules called compatible solutes. These molecules are the result of the attachment of a small negatively charged molecule to a sugar molecule. It has been found that these molecules, not only protect the microorganism against osmotic stress, as initially thought, but also against other extreme conditions. The observation that these molecules can confer protection against extreme conditions to isolated enzymes from different organisms made them an exciting prospect for potential biotechnological applications. One of the most widespread compatible solute in hyperthermophile organisms is the molecule 2&#8208;O&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;mannosyl&#8208;D&#8208;glycerate (MG). In addition to confer protection to proteins against extreme conditions, MG was found to prevent Alzheimer's &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregation and reduce &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibril formation in Parkinson&#8217;s disease.&#160;
In this work we studied, using computational methods, the catalytic mechanism of the synthesis of MG by the enzyme mannosylglycerate synthase (MGS) from the thermophilic bacteria&#160;  Rhodothermus marinus  . MGS is a promiscuous enzyme, accepting a variety of sugar donors and acceptors. This feature can be used to synthesize other molecules with potential biotechnological applications beyond MG. The unravelling of the catalytic mechanism with atomistic resolution and the associated free energies and electrostatic profiles of the stationary states obtained in the present work will help future investigations to full explore the potential of MGS.</dc:description>

         <title>Dicyano&#8208;Imidazole: A Facile Generation of Pure Blue TADF Materials for OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficiencies of the blue&#8208;emissive devices with imM&#8208;SPAC and imM&#8208;DMAC obtained in this work are the highest among the reported imidazole&#8208;based TADF&#8208;OLEDs, which are 13.8&#8201;% and 13.4&#8201;%, respectively. Both of Commission Internationale de l&#8242;Eclairage (CIE) coordinates are close to the saturated blue region at (0.17, 0.18) and (0.16, 0.19), respectively. Combining these tailor&#8208;made TADF compounds with specific device architectures, electroluminescent (EL) emission from sky&#8208;blue to deep&#8208;blue could be achieved, proving their great potential in EL applications.







Abstract
A series of dicyano&#8208;imidazole&#8208;based molecules with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties were synthesized to obtain pure blue&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The targeted molecules used dicyano&#8208;imidazole with a short&#8208;conjugated system as the electron acceptor to strong intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, and provide a relatively shallow energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). The cyano group was selected to improve imidazole as an electron acceptor due to its prominent electron&#8208;transporting characteristics. Four different electron donors, that is, 9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridine (DMAC), 10H&#8208;spiro(acridine&#8208;9,9&#8217;&#8208;fluoren) (SPAC), and 9,9&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridine (DPAC), were used to alternate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level to tune the emission color further. The crowded molecular structure in space makes the electron donor and acceptor almost orthogonal, reducing the energy gap (&#916;EST) between the first excited singlet (S1) and the triplet (T1) states and introducing significant TADF property. The efficiencies of the blue&#8208;emissive devices with imM&#8208;SPAC and imM&#8208;DMAC obtained in this work are the highest among the reported imidazole&#8208;based TADF&#8208;OLEDs, which are 13.8&#8201;% and 13.4&#8201;%, respectively.

         <title>Azo&#8208;Functionalized Zirconium&#8208;Based Metal&#8722;Organic Polyhedron as an Efficient Catalyst for CO2 Fixation with Epoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel zirconium&#8208;based metal organic polyhedron (MOP) with azo functionality has been synthesized and exhibits high catalytic activity for CO2 fixation. The azo group could enhance the solubility of the MOP as well as being good Lewis base sites to enrich CO2. DFT calculation showed Zr&#8208;AZDA MOP with the Lewis activity of Zr sites could dramatically reduce the energy barrier of CO2 cycloaddition.







Abstract
Chemical fixation of CO2 as C1 source at ambient temperature and low pressure is an energy&#8208;saving way to make use of the green&#8208;house gas, but it still remains a challenge since efficient catalyst with high catalytic active sites is required. Here, a novel monoclinic azo&#8208;functionalized Zr&#8208;based metal&#8722;organic polyhedron (Zr&#8208;AZDA) has been prepared and applied in CO2 fixation with epoxides. The inherent azo groups not only endow Zr&#8208;AZDA with good solubilization, but also act as basic sites to enrich CO2 showing efficient synergistic catalysis as confirmed by TPD&#8208;CO2 analysis. XPS results demonstrate that the Zr active sites in Zr&#8208;AZDA possess suitable Lewis acidity, which satisfies both substrates activation and products desorption. DFT calculation indicates the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step in CO2 cycloaddition could be reduced remarkably (by ca. 60.9&#8201;%) in the presence of Zr&#8208;AZDA, which may rationalize the mild and efficient reaction condition employed (80&#8201;&#176;C and 1&#8197;atm of CO2). The work provides an effective multi&#8208;functional cooperative method for improvement of CO2 cycloaddition.

         <title>The Coordinate Reaction Model: An Obstacle to Interpreting the Emergence of Chemical Complexity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accurate descriptions: Time&#8208;invariant (T1) models are the basis of the molecular description of modern organic chemistry. However, applied to open systems far from equilibrium, they may lead to erroneous interpretations. In such systems, stationary states must be described, in both their stability and evolution (generalized evolution criterion), through irreversibility (time variant, T&#8722;1) by macroscopic systems methods. Even ordinate, abscissa and curves, in reductionistic graphical descriptions; have different meanings.







Abstract
The way chemical transformations are described by models based on microscopic reversibility does not take into account the irreversibility of natural processes, and therefore, in complex chemical networks working in open systems, misunderstandings may arise about the origin and causes of the stability of non&#8208;equilibrium stationary states, and general constraints on evolution in systems that are far from equilibrium. In order to be correctly simulated and understood, the chemical behavior of complex systems requires time&#8208;dependent models, otherwise the irreversibility of natural phenomena is overlooked. Micro reversible models based on the reaction&#8208;coordinate model are time invariant and are therefore unable to explain the evolution of open dissipative systems. The important points necessary for improving the modeling and simulations of complex chemical systems are: a) understanding the physical potential related to the entropy production rate, which is in general an inexact differential of a state function, and b) the interpretation and application of the so&#8208;called general evolution criterion (GEC), which is the general thermodynamic constraint for the evolution of dissipative chemical systems.

         <title>Quantitative Distinction between Noble Metals Located in Mesopores from Those on the External Surface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different approaches to quantitatively distinguish the active sites on the surface of a mesoporous material from those sites located in the pores are compared. Arylphosphine probes and 31P MAS NMR spectroscopy are applied to quantify the introduced noble metals. The most promising method was to selectively fill the pores with an inert (tetraethylorthosilicate) and to subsequently quantify the accessible sites.







Abstract
We compare three methods for quantitatively distinguishing the location of noble metal (NM) particles in mesopores from those found on the external support surface. MCM&#8208;41 and SBA&#8208;15 with NM located in mesopores or on the external surface were prepared and characterized by TEM. 31P MAS NMR spectroscopy was used to quantify arylphosphines in complexes with NM. Phosphine/NM ratios drop from 2.0 to 0.2 when increasing the probe diameter from 1.08 to 1.54&#8197;nm. The reaction between NM and triphenylphosphine (TPP) within 3.0&#8197;nm MCM&#8208;41 pores takes due to confinement effects multiple weeks. In contrast, external NM react with TPP instantly. A promising method is filling the pores by using the pore volume impregnation technique with tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS). TPP loading revealed that 66&#8201;% of NMs are located on the external surface of MCM&#8208;41. The pore filling method can be used in association with any probe molecule, also for the quantification of acid sites.

Circles in a spiral: The synthesis and physical properties of a helical chiral bicyclic hydrocarbon are presented. The design of the Gel&#228;nder architecture is based on a rigid, chiral, room&#8208;temperature&#8208;stable central ortho&#8208;tetraphenylene subunit, which is further developed and twice macrocyclized to provide the target structure. Pure enantiomers are obtained by chromatography with a chiral stationary phase and allow the investigation of the chiroptical properties. Comparison between recorded and simulated CD spectra allows these enantiostable model compounds to be assigned.







Abstract
A new type of &#8220;Gel&#228;nder&#8221; molecule based on a ortho&#8208;tetraphenylene core is presented. The central para&#8208;quaterphenyl backbone is wrapped by a 4,4&#8217;&#8208;di((Z)&#8208;styryl)&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;biphenyl banister, with its aryl rings covalently attached to all four phenyl rings of the backbone. The resulting helical chiral bicyclic architecture consists exclusively of sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms. The target structure was assembled by expanding the central ortho&#8208;tetraphenylene subunit with the required additional phenyl rings followed by a twofold macrocyclization. The first macrocyclization attempts based on a twofold McMurry coupling were successful but low yielding; the second strategy, profiting from olefin metathesis, provided satisfying yields. Hydrogenation of the olefins resulted in a saturated derivative of similar topology, thereby allowing the interdependence between saturation and physico&#8208;chemical properties to be studied. The target structures, including their solid&#8208;state structures, were fully characterized. The helical chiral bicycle was synthesized as a racemate and separated into pure enantiomers by HPLC on a chiral stationary phase. Comparison of recorded and simulated chiroptical properties allowed the enantiomers to be assigned.

         <title>An Electrochemical Route for Special Oxidative Ring&#8208;Opening of Indoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method of electrochemical oxidation cleavage of indole derivatives and reorganization with alcohols to construct a variety of useful o&#8208;amidobenzoate building blocks was developed. The reaction involves a mild and easy handling protocol that occurs without any stoichiometric metals and extra oxidants. N&#8208;unprotected indoles or indoles substituted with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, even free indole could give the desired product, which expanded the substrate range.







Abstract
A novel electrochemical protocol for the oxidative cleavage of indoles has been developed, which o&#64256;ers a simple way to access synthetically useful anthranilic acid derivatives. In undivided cells, a wide variety of indoles and alcohol compounds are examined to a&#64256;ord amide ester aromatics without using extra oxidants and stoichiometric metal catalysts, which avoids the formation of undesired by&#8208;products and exhibits high atom economy. The products we described in this perspective represent a synthetic intermediate in numerous drug molecules and industrial chemical reagents and remarkably show potential application in the future.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Iod(az)olium Salts &#8211; Potent Halogen&#8208;Bond Donors in Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Heterocyclic iod(az)olium salts are introduced as highly potent halogen bonding (XB) organocatalysts reactivity in diverse test reactions based on the activation of halides and neutral species. Especially, N&#8208;methylated, dicationic derivatives outperformed all known monodentate iodine(I) and (III) XB&#8208;donors as well as the strong Lewis acid BF3.







Abstract
This article describes the application of N&#8208;heterocyclic iod(az)olium salts (NHISs) as highly reactive organocatalysts. A variety of mono&#8208; and dicationic NHISs are described and utilized as potent XB&#8208;donors in halogen&#8208;bond catalysis. They were benchmarked in seven diverse test reactions in which the activation of carbon&#8208; and metal&#8208;chloride bonds as well as carbonyl and nitro groups was achieved. N&#8208;methylated dicationic NHISs rendered the highest reactivity in all investigated catalytic applications with reactivities even higher than all previously described monodentate XB&#8208;donors based on iodine(I) and (III) and the strong Lewis acid BF3.

         <title>The Role of Alkali Cation Intercalates on the Electrochemical Characteristics of Nb2CTX MXene for Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different size cations from aqueous salt electrolyte intercalating into layered Nb2CTx electrode in supercapacitor were explored. The extent of interlayer expansion of electrode material varies with the size of the intercalation cations. Na+ ions showed the slowest permeation rate in the spacing between Nb2CTx layers compared to Li+ and K+.







Abstract
The intercalation of cations into layered&#8208;structure electrode materials has long been studied in depth for energy storage applications. In particular, Li+&#8208;, Na+&#8208;, and K+&#8208;based cation transport in energy storage devices such as batteries and electrochemical capacitors is closely related to the capacitance behavior. We have exploited different sizes of cations from aqueous salt electrolytes intercalating into a layered Nb2CTx electrode in a supercapacitor for the first time. As a result, we have demonstrated that capacitive performance was dependent on cation intercalation behavior. The interlayer spacing expansion of the electrode material can be observed in Li2SO4, Na2SO4, and K2SO4 electrolytes with d&#8208;spacing. Additionally, our results showed that the Nb2CTx electrode exhibited higher electrochemical performance in the presence of Li2SO4 than in that of Na2SO4 and K2SO4. This is partly because the smaller&#8208;sized Li+ transports quickly and intercalates between the layers of Nb2CTx easily. Poor ion transport in the Na2SO4 electrolyte limited the electrode capacitance and presented the lowest electrochemical performance, although the cation radius follows Li+&gt;Na+&gt;K+. Our experimental studies provide direct evidence for the intercalation mechanism of Li+, Na+, and K+ on the 2D layered Nb2CTx electrode, which provides a new path for exploring the relationship between intercalated cations and other MXene electrodes.

         <title>Surface Chemistry Impact on the Light Absorption by Colloidal Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>At the size scale at which quantum confinement effects arise in inorganic semiconductors, the materials&#8217; surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio is intrinsically high. This consideration sets surface chemistry as a powerful tool to exert further control on the electronic structure of the inorganic semiconductors. Among the materials that experience the quantum confinement regime, those prepared via colloidal synthetic procedures (the colloidal quantum dots &#8211;and wires and wells, too&#8211;) are prone to undergo surface reactions in the solution phase and thus represent an ideal framework to study the ensemble impact of surface chemistry on the materials&#8217; electronic structure. It is here discussed such an impact at the ground state by using the absorption spectrum of the colloidal quantum dots as a descriptor. The experiments show that the chemical species (the ligands) at the colloidal quantum dot surface induce changes to the optical band gap, the absorption coefficient at all wavelengths, and the ionization potential. These evidences point to a description of the colloidal quantum dot (the ligand/core adduct) as an indecomposable species, in which the orbitals localized on the ligands and the core mix in each other&#8217;s electric field. This description goes beyond conventional models that conceive the ligands on the basis of pure electrostatic arguments (i.e., either as a dielectric shell or as electric dipoles) or as a mere potential energy barrier at the core boundaries.</dc:description>

         <title>Osmaindenes: Synthesis and Reversible Mechanochromism Characteristics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of novel osmaindenes  1  &#8211;  6  bearing different substituents (CF  3  , H, I, Br, OCH  3  , N(Ph)  2  ) has been synthesized by nucleophilic reaction of water with the corresponding aromatic osmanaphthalyne complexes. All osmaindenes  1  &#8211;  6  have been characterized by elemental analysis (EA) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, although the low solubilities of  3  and  4  precluded the accumulation of their  13  C NMR spectra. Osmaindenes  2  ,  3  and  5  have also been characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Subsequently, through solid&#8208;state fluorescence spectroscopy, mechanochromic studies, and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, we found that osmaindenes  1  &#8211;  6  fluoresce at wavelengths in the range 500&#8211;800 nm, while also displaying reversible mechanochromic properties. The solid&#8208;state fluorescence emission of  1  after grinding extends into the near&#8208;infrared region. This research provides new insight into the design and synthesis of metallic materials with excellent mechanochromic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>The stereoselective oxidation of para&#8208;substituted benzenes by a cytochrome P450 biocatalyst.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The serine 244 to aspartate (S244D) variant of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP199A4 was used to expand its substrate range beyond benzoic acids. Substrates, in which the carboxylate group of the benzoic acid moiety is replaced, were oxidised with high activity by the S244D mutant (product formation rates &gt; 60 nmol.(nmol&#8208;CYP) &#8722;1 .min &#8722;1 ) and with total turnover numbers of up to 20,000. Ethyl &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation was more rapid than methyl oxidation, styrene epoxidation and S &#8208;oxidation. The S244D mutant catalysed the ethyl hydroxylation, epoxidation and sulfoxidation reactions with an excess of one stereoisomer (in some instances up to &gt;98%). The crystal structure of 4&#8208;methoxybenzoic acid&#8208;bound CYP199A4 S244D showed that the active site architecture and the substrate orientation were similar to that of the WT enzyme. Overall, this work demonstrates that CYP199A4 can catalyse the stereospecific hydroxylation, epoxidation or sulfoxidation of substituted benzene substrates under mild conditions resulting in more sustainable transformations using this heme monooxygenase enzyme.</dc:description>

         <title>Large Isotope Effects in Organometallic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) is key to understanding reaction mechanisms in many areas of chemistry and chemical biology, including organometallic chemistry. This ratio of rate constants,  k  H  /  k  D  , typically falls between 1&#8208;7. However, KIEs up to 105 have been reported, and can even be so large that reactivity with deuterium is unobserved. We collect here examples of large KIEs across organometallic chemistry, in catalytic and stoichiometric reactions, along with their mechanistic interpretations. Large KIEs occur in proton transfer reactions such as protonation of organometallic complexes and clusters, protonolysis of metal&#8211;carbon bonds, and dihydrogen reactivity. C&#8211;H activation reactions with large KIEs occur with late and early transition metals, photogenerated intermediates, and abstraction by metal&#8208;oxo complexes. We categorize the mechanistic interpretations of large KIEs into the following three types: (a) proton tunneling, (b) compound effects from multiple steps, and (c) semi&#8208;classical effects on a single step. This comprehensive collection of large KIEs in organometallics provides context for future mechanistic interpretation.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Fabrication of Multiple&#160;Dimensional Assemblies from Tryptophan&#8208;Based Racemate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fabricating structural complex assemblies from simple amino acid&#8208;based derivatives is attracting great research interests due to their easy accessibility and preparation. However, the morphological regulation of racemates (an equimolar mixture of enantiomers) were largely overlooked. In this work, through rational modulation of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, we achieved multiple dimensional architectures employing tryptophan&#8208;based racemate (RPWM). Upon assembling, 1D bundled nanofibers, 2D lamellar nanostructure and 3D urchin&#8208;like microflowers could be obtained depending on the solvents used. The corresponding morphology evolutions were successfully illustrated by changing the enantiomeric excess (ee) value. Moreover, for RPWM, uniform 0D nanospheres were formed in H  2  O under 4 &#8451;, which could spontaneously convert into lamella under ambient temperature. Taking advantages of its temperature&#8208;responsive phase change behavior, RPWM assemblies exhibited excellent removal efficiency for organic dye RhB, and could be reused for several consecutive cycles without significant changes in its removal performance. Taken together, it&#8217;s rational to envision that the engineering of racemates assembly pathways can greatly increase the robustness in a wide variety of supramolecular materials and further lead to their blooming versatile applications.</dc:description>

         <title>How Aromatic Fluorination Exchanges the Interaction Role of Pyridine with Carbonyl Compounds: The Pentafluoropyridine&#183;&#183;&#183;Formaldehyde Adduct</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rotational spectrum of the weakly bound complex pentafluoropyridine&#183;&#183;&#183;formaldehyde has been investigated using Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. From the analysis of the rotational parameters of the parent species and of the  13  C and  15  N isotopologues, the structural arrangement of the adduct has been unambiguously established. The full ring fluorination of pyridine has a dramatic effect on its binding properties: It alters the electron density distribution at the &#960;&#8208;cloud of pyridine creating a &#960;&#8208;hole and changing its electron donor&#8208;acceptor capabilities. In the complex, formaldehyde lies above the aromatic ring with one of the oxygen lone pairs, as conventionally envisaged, pointing toward its centre. This lone pair&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;&#8208;hole interaction, reinforced by a weak C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;N interaction, indicates an exchange of the electron&#8208;acceptor roles of both molecules when compared to the pyridine&#183;&#183;&#183;formaldehyde adduct. Tunnelling doublets due to the internal rotation of formaldehyde have also been observed and analysed leading to a discussion on the competition between lone pair&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;&#8208;hole and &#960; &#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; staking interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Functional Interface with Built&#8208;in Catalytic and Self&#8208;oxidation Sites for Highly Stable Lithium Sulfur Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium sulfur (Li&#8208;S) battery has attracted great attention due to its high theoretical energy density. The rapid redox conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) is effective for solving the serious shuttle effect and improving utilization of active materials. The functional design of separator interface with the fast charge transfer and active catalytic sites is desirable for accelerating the conversion of intermediates. Herein, the graphene&#8208;wrapped MnCO3  nanowire (G@MC) was prepared and utilized to engineer the separator interface. G@MC with active Mn2+  sites can effectively anchor the LiPS by forming the Mn&#8208;S chemical bond according to our theoretical calculation results. In addition, the catalytic Mn2+  sites and conductive graphene layer of G@MC could accelerate the reversible conversion of LiPS  via  the spontaneous &#8220;self&#8208;redox&#8221; reaction and the rapid electron transfer in electrochemical process. As a result, the G@MC&#8208;based battery exhibits only 0.038% capacity decay (per cycle) after 1000 cycles at 2.0 C. This work affords new insights for designing the integrated functional interface for stable Li&#8208;S battery.</dc:description>

         <title>Graphene Oxide&#8208;Assisted Covalent Triazine Framework for Boosting Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#960;&#8208;conjugation&#8208;linked CTF&#8208;1/GO hybrid material fabricated by facile low&#8208;temperature condensation of 1,4&#8208;dicyanobenzene in the presence of graphene oxide (GO) exhibited an optimum H2 evolution rate of 2262.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light irradiation, which was 9 times that of pure CTF&#8208;1. This result indicates addition of certain additives, particularly like graphene, could significantly improve the materials&#8242; conductivity, make the crystallinity of the framework itself play a less critical role.







Abstract
Covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) with two&#8208;dimensional structures have exhibited promising visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced H2 evolution performance. However, it is still a challenge to improve their activity. Herein, we report &#960;&#8208;conjugation&#8208;linked CTF&#8208;1/GO for boosting photocatalytic H2 evolution. The CTF&#8208;1/GO hybrid material was obtained by a facile low&#8208;temperature condensation of 1,4&#8208;dicyanobenzene in the presence of GO. The results of photocatalytic H2 evolution indicate that the optimum hybrid, CTF&#8208;1/GO&#8208;3.0, exhibited an H2 evolution rate of 2262.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light irradiation, which was 9 times that of pure CTF&#8208;1. The enhanced photocatalytic performance could be attributed to the fact that GO in CTF&#8208;1/GO hybrids not only acts as an electron collector and transporter like a &#8220;bridge&#8221; to facilitate the separation and transfer of photogenerated charges but also shortens the electron migration path due to its thin sheet layer uniformly distribution over CTF&#8208;1. This work could help future development of novel conjugated CTF&#8208;based composite materials as high&#8208;efficiency photocatalyst for photocatalysis.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Emissive Chromium(0), Molybdenum(0), and Tungsten(0) Complexes in the Solid State at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents emissive Cr(0), Mo(0), and W(0) complexes that contain a bidentate pyridyl&#8208;mesoionic carbene ligand and CO coligands. These systems exhibit dual vis and NIR II emissions at room temperature. The emissive excited triplet states were characterized by temperature&#8208;dependent luminescence and step&#8208;san FTIR spectroscopy in combination with density functional theory. The NIR quantum yield increases from Cr(0) over Mo(0) to W(0), reaching a very high value of 1.4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;3 at room temperature.







Abstract
The development of NIR emitters based on earth&#8208;abundant elements is an important goal in contemporary science. We present here Cr(0), Mo(0), and W(0) carbonyl complexes with a pyridyl&#8208;mesoionic carbene (MIC) based ligand. A detailed photophysical investigation shows that all the complexes exhibit dual emissions in the VIS and in the NIR region. The emissive excited states are assigned to two distinct triplet states by time&#8208;resolved emission and step&#8208;scan FTIR spectroscopy at variable temperature, supported by density functional theory. In particular, the NIR emissive triplet state exhibits unprecedented lifetimes of up to 600&#177;10&#8197;ns and quantum yields reaching 1.7&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;4 at room temperature.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This work presents&lt;/b&gt; emissive Cr(0), Mo(0), and W(0) complexes that contain a bidentate pyridyl-mesoionic carbene ligand and CO coligands. These systems exhibit dual vis and NIR II emissions at room temperature. The emissive excited triplet states were characterized by temperature-dependent luminescence and step-san FTIR spectroscopy in combination with density functional theory. The NIR quantum yield increases from Cr(0) over Mo(0) to W(0), reaching a very high value of 1.4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of NIR emitters based on earth-abundant elements is an important goal in contemporary science. We present here Cr(0), Mo(0), and W(0) carbonyl complexes with a pyridyl-mesoionic carbene (MIC) based ligand. A detailed photophysical investigation shows that all the complexes exhibit dual emissions in the VIS and in the NIR region. The emissive excited states are assigned to two distinct triplet states by time-resolved emission and step-scan FTIR spectroscopy at variable temperature, supported by density functional theory. In particular, the NIR emissive triplet state exhibits unprecedented lifetimes of up to 600&#177;10&#8197;ns and quantum yields reaching 1.7&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature. These are the first examples of Cr(0), Mo(0) and W(0) complexes that emit in the NIR II region.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Making Aromatic Phosphorus Heterocycles More Basic and Nucleophilic: Synthesis, Characterization and Reactivity of the First Phosphinine Selenide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and isolation of a phosphinine selenide was achieved for the first time. The &#963;&#8208;electron donating Me3Si&#8208;substituents significantly increase the energy of the phosphorus lone pair and hence its basicity, making the heterocycle considerably more basic and nucleophilic than the unsubstituted phosphinine C5H5P, as confirmed by the calculated gas&#8208;phase basicities. The novel phosphinine selenides show a distinct reactivity towards dienophiles, Au(I)Cl as well as alcohols.







Abstract
The synthesis and isolation of a phosphinine selenide was achieved for the first time by reacting red selenium with 2,6&#8208;bis(trimethylsilyl)phosphinine. The rather large coupling constant of 1JP,Se=883&#8197;Hz is in line with a P&#8722;Se bond of high s&#8208;character. The &#963;&#8208;electron donating Me3Si&#8208;substituents significantly increase the energy of the phosphorus lone pair and hence its basicity, making the heterocycle considerably more basic and nucleophilic than the unsubstituted phosphinine C5H5P, as confirmed by the calculated gas phase basicities. NBO calculations further reveal that the lone pairs of the selenium atom are stabilized through donor&#8208;acceptor interactions with antibonding orbitals of the aromatic ring. The novel phosphinine selenide shows a distinct reactivity towards hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;butyne, Au(I)Cl as well as iPrOH. Our results pave the way for new perspectives in the chemistry of phosphorus in low coordination.

         <title>Chemistry Platform for the Ultrafast Continuous Synthesis of High&#8208;Quality III&#8211;V Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A III&#8211;V quantum dots (QDs) chemistry platform is presented. III&#8208;nitrides QDs are prepared in short residence times in a one&#8208;step continuous process involving supercritical solvents. InxGa1&#8208;xN QDs fabricated via this platform exhibit strong photoluminescence with continuous bandgap shift towards lower energies measured when increasing indium content. The chemistry platform proposed could be easily transferred to other binary and ternary III&#8211;V systems source.







Abstract
A chemistry platform for the fast continuous synthesis of III&#8211;V quantum dots is demonstrated. III&#8208;nitride QDs are prepared by using short residence times (less than 30&#8197;s) in a one&#8208;step continuous process with supercritical solvents. GaN QDs prepared via this route exhibit strong UV photoluminescence with a structuring of the emission signal at low temperature (5&#8197;K), confirming their high quality. An example of metal site substitution is given with the synthesis of InxGa1&#8208;xN solid solution. A continuous bandgap shift towards lower energies is demonstrated when increasing the indium content with strong photoluminescence signals from UV to visible. The chemistry platform proposed could be easily extrapolated to binary and ternary III phosphides or arsenides with the homologous V source.

         <title>Effectiveness of the Oxygenation over Classical Protonolysis Reactions: A Case of Alkylzinc Complexes Incorporating an Aminoalcoholate Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkylzinc aminoalcoholates have emerged as powerful catalysts in organic synthesis and polymerization processes. Despite extensive research, difficulties in the rational design of these catalytic systems have hitherto been encountered. Most of the major obstacles stem largely from the relatively limited knowledge of the structure&#8208;activity relationship of zinc catalysts. In fact, the key active species are often generated  in situ  via the protonolysis of the alkylzinc precursors. Herein, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the oxygenation over the classical protonolysis in the synthesis of zinc alkylperoxides stabilized by an aminoalcoholate ligand. The controlled oxygenation of a  tert  &#8208;butylzinc complex incorporating a pridinolum (  prinol  ) ligand leads to an&#160;adduct of a (  prinol  )ZnOO  t  Bu moiety with the parent  t  BuZn(  prinol  ) complex and a novel dimer [  t  BuOOZn(  prinol  )]  2  with terminal alkylperoxide groups.&#160;Although sparse examples of heteroleptic adducts of the [RZn(L)]  x  [ROOZn(L)]  y  &#8208;type are known, the reported herein homoleptic [ROOZn(L)]  x  aggregate is unprecedented. Strikingly, comparative studies involving reactions between  t  BuZn(  prinol  ) and  tert  &#8208;butylhydroperoxide or ethanol revealed that the respective seemingly simple zinc alkylperoxides, or zinc alkoxides, respectively, are not accessible via the classical alcoholysis. We believe that these game&#8208;changing results concerning multifaceted chemistry of organozinc aminoalcoholates should pave the way for more rational development of various Zn&#8208;based catalytic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Self&#8208;Assembled Gel Beads for Tunable pH&#8208;Controlled Rosuvastatin Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article describes the fabrication of new pH&#8208;responsive hybrid gel beads combining the polymer gelator calcium alginate with two different low molecular weight gelators (LMWGs) based on 1,3:2,4&#8208;dibenzylidene&#8208;  d  &#8208;sorbitol: pH&#8208;responsive DBS&#8208;COOH and thermally&#8208;responsive DBS&#8208;CONHNH  2  , clearly demonstrating that different classes of LMWG can be fabricated into gel beads using this approach. We also demonstrate that self&#8208;assembled multi&#8208;component gel beads can be formed using different combinations of these gelators. The different gel bead formulations exhibit different responsiveness &#8211; the DBS&#8208;COOH network can disassemble within those beads in which it is present on raising the pH. To exemplify preliminary data for a potential application for these hybrid gel beads, we explored aspects of the delivery of the lipid&#8208;lowering active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) rosuvastatin. The release profile of this statin from the hybrid gel beads is pH&#8208;dependent, with greater release at pH 7.4 than at pH 4.0 &#8211; primary control of this process results from the pKa of the API. The extent of pH&#8208;mediated API release, is also significantly further modified according to gel bead composition. The DBS&#8208;COOH/alginate beads show rapid, highly effective drug release at pH 7.4, while the three&#8208;component DBS&#8208;COOH/DBS&#8208;CONHNH  2  /alginate system shows controlled slow release of the API under the same conditions. These initial results indicate that such gel beads constitute a promising, versatile and easily tuned platform suitable for further development for controlled drug delivery applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential Hydrogen Tunneling in o&#8208;Tolylmethylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>o  &#8208;Tolylmethylene  1  is a metastable triplet carbene that rearranges to  o  &#8208;xylylene  2  even at temperatures as low as 2.7 K via [1,4] H atom tunneling. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopical techniques were used to identify two conformers of  1  (  anti  and  syn  ) in noble gas matrices and in frozen organic solutions. Conformer&#8208;specific kinetic measurements revealed that the rate constants for the rearrangements of the  anti  and  syn  conformers of  1  are very similar. However, the orbital alignment in the  syn  conformer is less favorable for the hydrogen transfer reaction than the orbital configuration in the  anti  conformer. Our spectroscopic and quantum chemical investigations indicate that  anti  1  and  syn  1  rapidly interconvert via efficient quantum tunneling forming a rotational pre&#8208;equilibrium. The subsequent second tunneling reaction, the [1,4] H migration from  anti  1  to  2  , is rate&#8208;limiting for the formation of  2  . We here present an efficient strategy for the study of such tunneling equilibria.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;o  -Tolylmethylene  1  is a metastable triplet carbene that rearranges to  o  -xylylene  2  even at temperatures as low as 2.7 K via [1,4] H atom tunneling. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopical techniques were used to identify two conformers of  1  (  anti  and  syn  ) in noble gas matrices and in frozen organic solutions. Conformer-specific kinetic measurements revealed that the rate constants for the rearrangements of the  anti  and  syn  conformers of  1  are very similar. However, the orbital alignment in the  syn  conformer is less favorable for the hydrogen transfer reaction than the orbital configuration in the  anti  conformer. Our spectroscopic and quantum chemical investigations indicate that  anti  1  and  syn  1  rapidly interconvert via efficient quantum tunneling forming a rotational pre-equilibrium. The subsequent second tunneling reaction, the [1,4] H migration from  anti  1  to  2  , is rate-limiting for the formation of  2  . We here present an efficient strategy for the study of such tunneling equilibria.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Protection of Ag Clusters by Metal&#8208;Oxo Modules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monodisperse and atomically precise Ag nanoclusters have attracted considerable recent research interest. A conventional silver cluster usually consists of a silver metallic kernel and an organic peripheral ligand shell. Nevertheless, the present inevitable problem is the unsatisfied stability of such nanoclusters. In this concept, we will give an introduction to Ag clusters protected by metal&#8208;oxo modules which exhibit enhanced stability and unique properties. Accordingly, three different types of clusters are summarized: (1) Ag clusters protected by mononuclear oxometallates; (2) Ag clusters protected by block&#8208;like metal&#8208;oxo clusters; (3) Ag clusters protected by hollow&#8208;like metal&#8208;oxo clusters. The aim of this concept is to offer possible general guidance and insight into future rational design of more metal&#8208;oxo clusters protected silver clusters or even other coinage metal nanoclusters.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a H  2  O  2  generator, 2e  &#8208;  oxygen reduction reaction active electrocatalyst plays an important role in advanced oxidation process to degrade organic pollutants in sewage. To enhance the tendency of NiCo  2  S  4  towards 2e  &#8208;  reduction reaction, N atoms are doped in its structure and replace S  2&#8208;  . The result implies this weakens the interaction between NiCo  2  S  4  and OOH*, suppresses O&#8208;O bond breaking and enhances H  2  O  2  selectivity. This electrocatalyst also shows photothermal effect. Under photothermal heating, H  2  O  2  produced by oxidation reduction reaction can decompose and release &#183;OH, which degrades organic pollutants with advanced oxidation process. Photothermal effect induced advance oxidation process shows obvious advantages over traditional Fenton reaction, such as wide pH adaptation scope and low secondary pollutant due to its Fe  2+  free character. With Zn as anode, the electrocatalyst as cathode material, Zn&#8208;O  2  battery is assembled. It achieves electricity generation and photothermal effect induced advance oxidation process simultaneously.</dc:description>

         <title>Autotandem Catalysis: Inexpensive and Green Access to Functionalized Ketones by Intermolecular Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Amidoalkynylation/Hydration Cascade Reaction via N&#8208;Acyliminium Ion Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron&#8208;based catalysts were applied in cascade&#8208;type reactions for the synthesis of different carbonyl compounds. The reactions proceeded by a new iron&#8208;catalyzed cascade of alkynylation/hydration by using both the &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;Lewis acid properties of iron salts. The alkynylation reactions of several endo and exocyclic acetoxylactams were achieved with three different catalysts including FeCl  3  .6H  2  O, FeCl  3  , and Fe(OTf)  3  showing the efficiency of &#963;&#8208;Lewis acidity of iron (III) salts in catalyzing the alkynylation reaction. We also demonstrated that the reaction sequence could be shortened by the direct use of hydroxylactams, leading to an environmentally friendly protocol, avoiding the need to perform unnecessary lengthy steps. A combination of the hard/soft iron Lewis acid properties was then used to implement an unprecedented tandem intermolecular alkynylation/intramolecular hydration sequence allowing expedient access to a new carbonyl structures from trivial materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron Binding in the Ferroxidase Site of Human Mitochondrial Ferritin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ferritins are nanocage proteins that store iron ions in their central cavity as hydrated ferric oxide biominerals. In mammals, further the L (light) and H (heavy) chains constituting cytoplasmic maxi&#8208;ferritins, an additional type of ferritin has been identified, the mitochondrial ferritin (MTF). Human MTF (hMTF) is a functional homopolymeric H&#8208;like ferritin performing the ferroxidase activity in its ferroxidase site (FS), in which Fe(II) is oxidized to Fe(III) in the presence of dioxygen. To better investigate its ferroxidase properties, here we performed time&#8208;lapse X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis of hMTF, providing structural evidence of how iron ions interact with hMTF and of their binding to the FS. Transient iron binding sites, populating the pathway along the cage from the iron entry channel to the catalytic center, were also identified. Furthermore, our kinetic data at variable iron loads indicate that the catalytic iron oxidation reaction occurs via a diferric peroxo intermediate followed by the formation of ferric&#8208;oxo species, with significant differences with respect to human H&#8208;type ferritin.</dc:description>

         <title>Electroresponsive Performances of Ecoresorbable Smart Fluids Consisting of Various Plant&#8208;Derived Carrier Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper proposes the fabrication of a new type of electrorheological (ER) fluid with ecoresorbable features as well as excellent electroresponsive performance. The proposed ER fluid consists of biocompatible Mg&#8208;doped silica/titania hollow nanoparticles (ST HNPs) suspended in vegetable oils (canola, grapeseed, olive, and soy). The effects of biodegradable plant&#8208;derived carrier liquids on the ER performance are analyzed. The polarizability and wettability of the fabricated ER fluids are studied. The high polarizability of the nanoparticles contributes to the high electroresponsive performance by inducing electrostatic interactions between the nanoparticles under electric fields, which enables the formation of a rigid and strong fibril structure. A suitable wettability, which represents the favorable interaction between the oil and the nanoparticles, allows the nanoparticles to disperse evenly in the oil and prevents their aggregation, therefore making it easier to form a rigid and strong fibrillar structure under the electric field.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The lithium complexes [(WCA&#8208;NHC)Li(toluene)] of anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes with a weakly coordinating borate moiety (WCA&#8208;NHC, WCA = B(C  6  F  5  )  3  , NHC = IDipp = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) were used for the preparation of silver(I) or copper(I) WCA&#8208;NHC complexes. While the reactions in THF with AgCl or CuCl afforded anionic mono&#8208; and dicarbene complexes with solvated lithium counterions [Li(THF)  n  ]  +  (n = 3, 4), the reactions in toluene proceeded with elimination of LiCl and formation of the neutral phosphine and arene complexes [(WCA&#8208;NHC)M(PPh  3  )] and [(WCA&#8208;NHC)M(  &#951;  2  &#8208;toluene)] (M = Ag, Cu).

         <title>Are Heavy Pnictogen &#8208; &#960; Interactions Really &#8220;&#960; Interactions&#8221; ?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;covalent interactions of heavy pnictogens with &#960;&#8208;arenes play a fundamental role in fields like crystal engineering or catalysis. The strength of such bonds is based on an interplay between dispersion and donor/acceptor interactions, and is generally attributed to the presence of &#960;&#8208;arenes. Computational studies of the interaction between the heavy pnictogens As, Sb and Bi and cyclohexane, in comparison with previous studies on the interaction between heavy pnictogens and benzene, show that this concept probably has to be revised. A thorough analysis of all the different energetic components that play a role in these systems, carried out with state of the art computational methods, sheds light on how they influence one another and the effect that their interplay has on the overall system. Furthermore, the analysis of such interactions leads us to the unexpected finding that the presence of the pnictogen compounds strongly affects the conformational equilibrium of cyclohexane, reversing the relative stability of the chair and boat&#8208;twist conformers, suggesting a possible application of tuneable dispersion energy donors to stabilize the desired conformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Illuminating Protein Phase Separation: Reviewing Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission, Fluorescent Molecular Rotor and Solvatochromic Fluorophore based Probes.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein phase separation process involving protein unfolding, misfolding, condensation and aggregation  etc.  has been associated with numerous human degenerative diseases. The complexity in protein conformational transitions results in multi&#8208;step and multi&#8208;species biochemical pathways upon protein phase separation. Recent progresses in designing novel fluorescent probes have unraveled the enriched details of phase separated proteins and provided mechanistic insights towards disease pathology. In this review, we summarized the design and characterizations of fluorescent probes that selectively illuminate proteins at different phase separated states with a focus on aggregation&#8208;induced emission probes, fluorescent molecular rotors, and solvatochromic fluorophores. Inspired by these pioneering works, a design blueprint was proposed to further develop fluorescent probes that can potentially shed light on the unresolved protein phase separated states in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Turning the Light on Phenols: New Opportunities in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phenols (  I  ) are extremely relevant chemical functionalities in natural, synthetic and industrial chemistry. Their corresponding electron&#8208;rich anions, namely phenolates (  I  ), are characterized by interesting physicochemical properties that can be drastically altered upon light excitation. Specifically, phenolates (  I  ) become strong reducing agents in the excited state and are able to generate reactive radicals from suitable precursors  via  single&#8208;electron transfer processes. Thus, these species can photochemically trigger strategic bond&#8208;forming reactions, including their direct aromatic C&#8208;H functionalization. Moreover, substituted phenolate anions can act as photocatalysts to enable synthetically useful organic transformations. An alternative mechanistic manifold is represented by the ability of phenolate derivatives  I  to form ground state electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes with electron&#8208;poor radical sources. These complementary scenarios have paved the way for the development of a wide range of relevant organic reactions. In this Minireview, we present the main examples of this research field, and give insight on emerging trends in phenols photocatalysis towards richer organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Propelling Hybrid Gels Incorporating an Active Self&#8208;Assembled Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Gelator</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid gel beads based on combining a low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator (LMWG) with a polymer gelator (PG) demonstrate enhanced ability to self&#8208;propel in water, with the LMWG playing an active role. Hybrid gel beads were loaded with ethanol and shown to move in water via &#8216;Marangoni effect&#8217; surface tension changes caused by the expulsion of ethanol &#8211; smaller beads move further and faster than larger beads. Flat shapes of the hybrid gel were cut using a &#8216;stamp&#8217; &#8211; circles moved the furthest while stars showed more rotational movement on their own axis. Comparing hybrid LMWG/PG gel beads with PG&#8208;only beads demonstrated that the LMWG speeds up the beads, enhancing the rate of self&#8208;propulsion. Self&#8208;assembly of the LMWG into a &#8216;solid&#8208;like&#8217; network prevents its leaching from the gel. The LMWG also retains its own unique function &#8211; specifically, remediating methylene blue pollutant dye from basic water as a result of non&#8208;covalent interactions. The mobile hybrid beads accumulate this dye more effectively than PG&#8208;only beads. Self&#8208;propelling gel beads have potential applications in removal/delivery of active agents in environmental or biological settings. The ability of self&#8208;assembling LMWGs to enhance mobility and control removal/delivery, suggests that adding them into self&#8208;propelling systems can add significant value.</dc:description>

         <title>The influence of secondary interactions on the [N&#8208;I&#8208;N]+ halogen bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>[Bis(pyridine)iodine(I)]  +  complexes offer controlled access to halonium ions under mild conditions. The reactivity of such stabilized halonium ions is primarily determined by their three&#8208;center, four&#8208;electron [N&#8208;I&#8208;N]  +  halogen bond. We studied the importance of chelation, strain, steric hindrance and electrostatic interaction for the structure and reactivity of halogen bonded halonium ions by acquiring their  15  N NMR coordination shifts and measuring their iodenium release rates, and interpreted the data with the support of DFT computations. A bidentate ligand stabilizes the [N&#8208;I&#8208;N]  +  halogen bond, decreasing the halenium transfer rate. Strain weakens the bond and accordingly increases the release rate. Remote modifications in the backbone do not influence the stability as long as the effect is entirely steric. Incorporating an electron&#8208;rich moiety close by the [N&#8208;I&#8208;N]  +  motif increases the iodenium release rate. The analysis of the iodine(I) transfer mechanism highlights the impact of secondary interactions, and may provide a handle on the induction of stereoselectivity in electrophilic halogenations.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity and Passivation of Fe Nanoclusters on h&#8208;BN/Rh(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactivity of iron nanocluster arrays on  h&#8208;  BN/Rh(111) was studied using  in situ  high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The morphology and reactivity of the iron nanoclusters (Fe&#8208; NCs) were investigated by CO adsorption. On&#8208;top and hollow/edge sites were determined to be the available adsorption sites on the as&#8208;prepared Fe&#8208;NCs and CO dissociation was observed at 300 K. C&#8208; and O&#8208;precovered Fe&#8208;NCs showed no catalytic activity towards CO dissociation because the hollow/edge sites were blocked by the C and O atoms.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The reactivity of iron nanocluster arrays on  h-  BN/Rh(111) was studied using  in situ  high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The morphology and reactivity of the iron nanoclusters (Fe- NCs) were investigated by CO adsorption. On-top and hollow/edge sites were determined to be the available adsorption sites on the as-prepared Fe-NCs and CO dissociation was observed at 300 K. C- and O-precovered Fe-NCs showed no catalytic activity towards CO dissociation because the hollow/edge sites were blocked by the C and O atoms. Therefore, these adsorption sites were identified to be the most active sites of the Fe-NCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Small&#8208;molecule Diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based Dye for in vivo NIR&#8208;IIa Fluorescence Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic small&#8208;molecule fluorophores with near&#8208;infrared IIa (NIR&#8208;IIa) emission have great potential in pre&#8208;clinical detection and inoperative imaging due to the high&#8208;spatial resolution and deep penetration. However, developments of the NIR&#8208;IIa fluorophores are still facing considerable challenges. In this work, a series of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)&#8208;based fluorophores were designed and synthesized. Subsequently, nanomaterial  T25@F127  with significant NIR&#8208;IIa emission properties was rationally prepared by encapsulating DPP&#8208;based fluorophore  T25  , and was selected for fluorescence angiography and cerebral vascular microscopic imaging with nearly 800 &#956;m penetrating depth and excellent signal&#8208;background ratio of 4.07 and 2.26 (at 250 and 400 &#956;m) , respectively. Furthermore, the nanomaterial  T25@cRGD  with tumor targeting ability can image tiny metastatic tumor on intestine with a small size of 0.3 mm&#215;1.0 mm and high&#8208;spatial resolution (SBR = 3.84). This study demonstrates that the nanomaterials which encapsulated  T25  behave as excellent NIR&#8208;IIa fluorescence imaging agents and have a great potential for  in vivo  biological application.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The reaction of [PtCl  2  (COD)]  (COD = 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene)  with  i  Pr  2  P(C  9  H  8  N) led to the formation of the chlorido complexes,  cis  &#8208;[PtCl  2  {  i  Pr  2  P(C  9  H  8  N)}  2  ] (  1  ) and  trans  &#8208;[PtCl  2  {  i  Pr  2  P(C  9  H  8  N)}  2  ] (  2  ).

         <title>A full flexible NH4+&#160; ion battery based on the concentrated hydrogel electrolyte for enhanced performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonmetal ammonium&#160; NH  4  +  &#160;ions have recently been explored as effective charge carriers in battery systems due to their abundancy, light weight, small hydration shells in water. The research concerning the use of NH  4  +  &#160;ion&#160;redox chemistry&#160;in flexible batteries, is still in its infancy. For the first time, we report a flexible full&#160; NH  4  +  &#160;ion battery (AIB) composed of a concentrated hydrogel electrolyte sandwiched between NH4V3O8&#183;2.9H2O nanobelts cathode and polyaniline (PANI) anode. The hydrogel electrolyte is simply synthesized by using ammonium sulfate, xanthan gum and water. As a reference,&#160;AIB based on the liquid aqueous electrolyte is prepared first, which exhibits a capacity of 121 mAh g&#8208;1&#160; and capacity retention of 95% after 400 cycles at a specific current of 0.1 A g&#160;&#8208;1. The full flexible AIBs are then fabricated using hydrogel electrolytes with varied salt concentrations, to maximize the electrochemical performance. It is found that the battery based on the hydrogel electrolyte prepared from 3 M ammonium sulfate solution shows the best electrochemical performance&#160;i.e., a capacity of 60 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;while maintaining a capacity retention of 88% after 250 cycles at a specific current of 0.1 A g&#160; &#8208;1. Moreover, the flexible AIB retains excellent electrochemical performance when bent at different angles, demonstrating remarkable mechanical strength and flexibility. Therefore, this study sheds new light on the utilization of concentrated hydrogel electrolyte in the AIB chemistry, for future developments of new electrochemical energy storage technology.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Photoaffinity Probes for Live&#8208;Cell MS&#8208;Based Proteomics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a one&#8208;step Ugi reaction protocol for the expedient synthesis of photoaffinity probes for live&#8208;cell MS&#8208;based proteomics. The reaction couples an amine affinity function with commonly used photoreactive groups, and a variety of handle functionalities. Using this technology, a series of pan&#8208;BET selective bromodomain photoaffinity probes were obtained by parallel synthesis. Studies on the effects of photoreactive group, linker length and irradiation wavelength on photocrosslinking efficiency provide valuable insights into photoaffinity probe design. Optimal probes were progressed to MS based proteomics to capture the BET family of proteins from live cells and reveal their potential on&#8208; and off&#8208;target profiles.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We present a one-step Ugi reaction protocol for the expedient synthesis of photoaffinity probes for live-cell MS-based proteomics. The reaction couples an amine affinity function with commonly used photoreactive groups, and a variety of handle functionalities. Using this technology, a series of pan-BET selective bromodomain photoaffinity probes were obtained by parallel synthesis. Studies on the effects of photoreactive group, linker length and irradiation wavelength on photocrosslinking efficiency provide valuable insights into photoaffinity probe design. Optimal probes were progressed to MS based proteomics to capture the BET family of proteins from live cells and reveal their potential on- and off-target profiles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>PdNi/Ni Nanotubes Assembled by Mesoporous Nanoparticles for Efficient Alkaline Ethanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The optimization of structure and composition is essential to improve the performance of catalysts. Herein, mesoporous nanoparticles assembled PdNi/Ni nanotubes (mPdNi/Ni NTs) are successfully fabricated using nickel nanowires as sacrificial template. The combination of nanotubular structure with mesoporous nanoparticle morphology can provide facilitated transfer channels and sufficient active sites, allowing the full contact and reaction between catalysts and reactants. Therefore, the synthesized mPdNi/Ni NTs exhibited superior ethanol oxidation performance to mesoporous Pd nanotubes and commercial Pd black. This study proposes a rational strategy for the development of nanoparticle assembled nanotubes with surface mesoporous morphology, which can greatly improve catalytic performance in various electrocatalytic fields.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis, photophysical, and electrochemical properties of selectively  mono  &#8208;,  bis  &#8208; and  tris  &#8208;dimethylamino&#8208; and trimethylammonium&#8208;substituted  bis  &#8208;triarylborane bithiophene chromophores are presented along with the water solubility and singlet oxygen sensitizing efficiency of the cationic compounds  Cat  1+  ,  Cat  2+  ,  Cat(i)  2+  , and  Cat  3+  . Comparison with the  mono  &#8208;triarylboranes reveals the large influence of the bridging unit on the properties of the  bis  &#8208;triarylboranes, especially those of the cationic compounds. Based on these preliminary investigations, the interactions of  Cat  1+  ,  Cat  2+  ,  Cat(i)  2+  , and  Cat  3+  with DNA, RNA, and DNApore were investigated in buffered solutions. The same compounds were investigated for their ability to enter and localize within organelles of human lung carcinoma (A549) and normal lung (WI38) cells showing that not only the number of charges but also their distribution over the chromophore influences interactions and staining properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterobimetallic lanthanide&#8208;coinage metal compounds featuring possible metal&#8208;metal interactions in the exited state</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterometallic complexes, combining metals at the outer rim of the d&#8208;block, e.g. lanthanides(III) (Ln) and coinage metals(I) (M) are scarcely reported, synthetically challenging and highly interesting in terms of their interaction. In this context, we synthesized heterobimetallic Ln&#8208;M compounds ligated by the amidinate system (N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis[(2&#8208;diphenylphosphino)phenyl]formamidinate, dpfam). The resulting compounds [dpfam  3  LnM][OTf] (Ln = La, Nd and M = Ag, Au) feature a close proximity of the two metal centers and were investigated experimentally by photoluminescence spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. The latter showed rare La&#8208;Au interactions for the first excited state.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Photoswitching in Norbornadiene (NBD)/Quadricyclane (QC) &#8211; Fullerene Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With respect to molecular switches, initializing the quadricyclane (QC) to norbornadiene (NBD) back&#8208;reaction by light is highly desirable. Our previous publication provided a unique solution for this purpose by utilizing covalently bound C60  . In this work, we investigate the fundamental processes within these hybrids. Variation of the linker&#8208;unit connecting the NBD/QC moiety with the fullerene core is used as a tool to tune the properties of the resulting hybrids. Utilizing the Prato reaction two unprecedented NBD/QC &#8208; fullerene hybrids having a long&#8208;rigid and a short&#8208;rigid linker were synthesized. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that this results in an average QC &#8211; C60  distance of up to 14.2 &#197;. By comparing the NBD &#8208; QC switching of these derivatives with the already established one having a flexible linker, valuable mechanistic insights were gained. Most importantly, spatial convergence of the QC moiety and the fullerene core is inevitable for an efficient back&#8208;reaction.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pnictinidenes are an increasingly relevant species in main group chemistry and generally exhibit proclivity for the triplet electronic ground state. However, the elusive singlet electronic states are often desired for chemical applications. We predict the singlet&#8208;triplet energy differences (&#916;EST = ESinglet &#8722; ETriplet) of simple group 15 and 16 substituted pnictinidenes (Pn&#8208;R; Pn = P, As, Sb, or Bi) with highly reliable focal&#8208;point analyses targeting the CCSDTQ/CBS level of theory. The only cases we predict to have favorable singlet states are P&#8208;PH2 (&#8722;3.2 kcal mol&#8208;1) and P&#8208;NH2 (&#8722;0.2 kcal mol&#8208;1). &#916;EST trends are discussed in light of the geometric predictions as well as qualitative natural bond order analysis to elucidate some of the important electronic structure features. Our work provides a rigorous benchmark for the &#916;EST of fundamental Pn&#8208;R moieties and provides a firm foundation for the continued study of heavier pnictinidenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Azo&#8208;Bridged Furoxanylazoles as High&#8208;Performance Energetic Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of novel energetic materials comprising of azo&#8208;bridged furoxanylazoles enriched with energetic functionalities was designed and synthesized. These high&#8208;energy materials were thoroughly characterized by IR and multinuclear NMR (  1  H,  13  C,  14  N) spectroscopy, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The molecular structures of representative amino and azo oxadiazole assemblies were additionally confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and X&#8208;ray powder diffraction. A comparison of contributions of explosophoric moieties into the density of energetic materials revealed that furoxan and 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole rings are the densest motifs while the substitution of the azide and amino fragments on the nitro and azo ones leads to an increase of the density. Azo bridged energetic materials have high nitrogen&#8208;oxygen contents (68.8&#8208;76.9%) and high thermal stability. The synthesized compounds exhibit good experimental densities (1.62&#8208;1.88 g cm  &#8208;3  ), very high enthalpies of formation (846&#8208;1720 kJ mol  &#8208;1  ), and, as a result, excellent detonation performance (detonation velocities 7.66&#8208;9.09 km s  &#8208;1  and detonation pressures 25.0&#8208;37.7 GPa). From the application perspective, the detonation parameters of azo oxadiazole assemblies exceed those of the benchmark explosive RDX, while a combination of high detonation performance and acceptable friction sensitivity of azo(1,2,4&#8208;triazolylfuroxan) make it a promising potential alternative to PETN.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The combination of different nitrogen&#8208;rich heterocycles into a molecule can fine&#8208;tune its energetic performance and physical properties as well as its safety for use in energetic materials. Herein, 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole was incorporated into 1,2,4&#8208;triazole to construct new energetic backbones. 3&#8208;(5&#8208;amino&#8208;1  H  &#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;5&#8208;amine (  5  ) was designed and synthesized.

All derivatives were fully characterized and five of them were further confirmed via X&#8208;ray diffraction. The theoretical calculations, energetic performance, safety, and the main decomposition gaseous products of 1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole&#8208;derived energetic materials were studied. Compound  7  and its dihydroxylammonium salt (  7c  ) exhibited prominent detonation performance comparable to RDX while possessing satisfying thermal stabilities and mechanical sensitivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure Recovery and Recycling of the Used LiCoO2 Cathode Material</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The large number of lithium batteries have been retiring from the market of energy storage. Thus, the recycling of the used electrode materials is becoming urgent. In this study, the industrial machinery processing was used to recover the crystal structure of the waste LiCoO  2  materials with the combination of small&#8208;scale equipment repair technology. The results show that the crystal parameters of the repaired LiCoO  2  material become small, the unit cell volume is reduced, and the crystal structure tends to be stable. The Co&#8208;O bond length of 1.9134 nm, O&#8208;Co&#8208;O bond angle of 94.72&#186;, the (003) interplanar spacing of 0.467 nm indicate the excellent recovery level of the repaired LiCoO  2  . In addition, the electrochemical performance of the repaired LiCoO  2  material is greatly improved, compared with the waste material. The capacity of the repaired electrode material can be maintained at 120 mAh g  &#8208;1  after 100 cycles at the current density of 0.2 C. The promising rate performance of the repaired electrode material demonstrates the stable structure. This research work provides a large&#8208;scale method for the direct recovery of LiCoO  2  with the reduction of unnecessary energy and reagent consumption, which will be beneficial to the environmental protection.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Investigation of a Synthetic Route to Biaryls via the Sigmatropic Rearrangement of Arylsulfonium Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A comprehensive mechanistic investigation was conducted on the coupling reaction of aryl sulfoxides with phenols by means of trifluoroacetic anhydride to yield biaryls. NMR experiments revealed that our previously proposed mechanism, which consists of a cascade of an interrupted Pummerer reaction and a rate&#8208;determining [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement, is reasonable. The electronic effects of the substrates have also been evaluated to elucidate the nature of the rearrangement step. Based on experimental observations and theoretical calculations, we conclude that the rearrangement is highly asynchronous and stepwise rather than concerted when electron&#8208;rich phenols are employed for the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Lateral Metallation and Redistribution Reactions of Sodium Ferrates Containing Bulky 2,6&#8208;Diisopropyl&#8208;N&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)anilide Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkali&#8208;metal&#160;ferrates containing amide groups have emerged as regioselective bases capable of promoting Fe&#8208;H exchanges of aromatic substrates. Advancing this area of heterobimetallic chemistry, a new series of sodium ferrates is introduced incorporating the bulky arylsilyl amido ligand N(SiMe3)(Dipp) (Dipp= 2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3). Influenced by the large steric demands imposed by this amide, transamination of [NaFe(HMDS)3]&#160;(HMDS = N(SiMe3)2) with an excess of HN(SiMe3)(Dipp)&#160;led to the isolation of heteroleptic&#160;[Na(HMDS)2Fe{N(SiMe3)Dipp}]&#8734;&#160;(1) resulting from the exchange of just one&#160;HMDS&#160;&#160;group. An alternative co&#8208;complexation approach, combining the homometallic metal amides [NaN(SiMe3)Dipp] and [Fe{N(SiMe3)Dipp}2] induces lateral metallation of one Me arm from the SiMe3&#160;group in the iron amide furnishing tetrameric&#160;[NaFe{N(SiCH2Me2)Dipp}{N(SiMe3)Dipp}]4&#160;(2). Reactivity studies support that this deprotonation is driven by the steric incompatibility of the single metal amides rather than the basic capability of the sodium reagent. Displaying synergistic reactivity, heteroleptic sodium ferrate&#160;1&#160;can selectively promote ferration of pentafluorobenzene using one of its HMDS arms to give heterotrileptic&#160;[Na{N(SiMe3)Dipp}(HMDS)Fe(C6F5)]&#8734;&#160;(4).&#160;Attempts to deprotonate less activated pyridine led to the isolation of NaHMDS and heteroleptic Fe(II) amide&#160;[(py)Fe{N(SiMe3)Dipp}(HMDS)] (5),&#160;resulting from an alternative redistribution process which is favoured by the Lewis donor ability of this substrate.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on a on the liquid&#8208;crystalline (LC) and luminescent properties of a series of&#160;  N  &#8208;annulated perylenes (  1  &#8208;  4  ) alternating amide and ester groups in their molecular structure. We found that the LC properties of these compounds does not only depends on the number of hydrogen bonding (H&#8208;bonding) units, but also on the relative position of the amide linkers in the molecule. The absence of amide groups in compound&#160;  1  &#160;leads to no LC properties, while the use of four amide groups induces the formation of long temperature range columnar hexagonal phase in compound&#160;  4  . Remarkably, compound&#160;  3,  &#160;bearing two amide groups in the inner part of the structure stabilizes the columnar LC phases better than its structural isomer&#160;  2  , with the amide groups in the outer part of the molecule. In the same direction, we found that only compounds&#160;  1  &#160;and&#160;  2  , with no H&#8208;bonding units in the inner part of the molecule, exhibit luminescence vapochromism upon exposure to organic solvent vapors.</dc:description>
