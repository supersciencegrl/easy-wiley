      <title>Ring&#8208;Closing Olefin Metathesis Catalyzed by Well&#8208;Defined Vanadium Alkylidene Complexes</title>

In modern research, C&#8722;S/N&#8722;S bonds are indispensable in many biological important compounds and pharmaceuticals. Given many advantages (such as inexpensive, environmentally benign, and easy&#8208;handled catalysts or reagents) of iodine and its derivatives, several new strategies, such as oxidation relay strategy, have been greatly developed and accelerated the advancement of this field.

      <dc:description>
Germacrene A shows a unique and interesting chemistry mainly characterised by its reactivity towards acid&#8208;catalysed cyclisations and its thermal lability in a Cope rearrangement to &#946;&#8208;elemene. Similar observations have been made for other germacrenes, suggesting that the high ring strain associated with the 10&#8208;membered ring in these systems may be a strong driving force for the observed reactions leading to much less strained compounds with 6&#8208;membered rings. Germacrene A is of central importance in sesquiterpene biosynthesis and this Review covers the biosynthetic derivatives, the absolute configurations and the natural sources.

Helical Molecular Orbitals&#8212;Hel&#8208;MOs&#8212;have been tailored theoretically through the torsion angle of diphenylbutadiynes. Experimentally, suitable conformations have been locked by the synthesis of cyclic spirobifluorenes.

      <title>Tuning the Molecular Packing of Self&#8208;Assembled Amphiphilic Pt(II) Complexes by Variation of the Hydrophilic Side Chain Length</title>
      <dc:description>Understanding the relationship between molecular design and packing modes constitutes one of the major challenges in self&#8208;assembly and is essential for the preparation of functional materials. Herein, we have achieved high precision control over the supramolecular packing of amphiphilic Pt(II) complexes by systematic variation of the hydrophilic side chain length. A novel approach of general applicability based on complementary X&#8208;ray diffraction and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy has allowed us to establish a clear correlation between molecular features and supramolecular ordering: systematically increasing the side chain length gradually increases the steric demand and reduces the extent of aromatic interactions, inducing a gradual shift in the molecular packing from parallel to a long&#8208;slipped organization. Notably, our findings highlight the necessity of advanced solid&#8208;state NMR techniques to gain structural information for supramolecular systems where single&#8208;crystal growth is not possible. Our work further demonstrates a new molecular design strategy to modulate aromatic interaction strengths and packing arrangements, which may be useful for the engineering of functional materials based on Pt(II) and aromatic molecules.</dc:description>

      <title>A general approach to intermolecular olefin hydroacylation via light induced HAT initiation: an efficient synthesis of long chain aliphatic ketones and functionalized fatty acids</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, an operationally simple, environmentally benign, and effective method for intermolecular radical hydroacylation of unactivated substrates employing photo&#8208;induced hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) initiation is described. The use of commercially available and inexpensive photoinitiators (Ph2CO and NHPI) makes the process attractive. The olefin hydroacylation protocol applies to a wide array of substrates bearing numerous functional groups and many complex structural units. The reaction proves to be scalable (up to 5 g scale). Different functionalized fatty acids, petrochemicals and naturally occurring alkanes are synthesized with this protocol. A radical chain mechanism is implicated for the process.</dc:description>

      <title>Paraoxonase Mimic by a Nanoreactor Aggregate Containing Benzimidazolium Calix and L&#8208;Histidine: Demonstration of the Acetylcholine Esterase Activity</title>
      <dc:description>An anion&#8208;mediated preorganization approach was used to design and synthesize the benzimidazolium&#8208;based calix compound  R1  &#8729;2ClO  4  &#8211;  . X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis revealed that the hydrogen bonding interactions between the benzimidazolium cations and N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) helped  R1  &#8729;2ClO  4  &#8211;  encapsulate DMF molecule(s)A nanoreactor, with  R1  &#8729;2ClO  4  &#8211;  and  L  &#8208;histidine (  L  &#8208;His) as the components, was fabricated using a neutralization method. The nanoreactor could detoxify paraoxon in 30 min.  L  &#8208;His played a vital role in this process. Paraoxonase is a well&#8208;known enzyme used for pesticide degradation. The Ellman&#8217;s reagent was used to determine the percentage inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the presence of the nanoreactor. The results indicated that the nanoreactor inhibited AChE inhibition.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An anion&#8208;mediated preorganization approach was used to design and synthesize the benzimidazolium&#8208;based calix compound  R1  &#8729;2ClO  4  &#8211;  . X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis revealed that the hydrogen bonding interactions between the benzimidazolium cations and N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) helped  R1  &#8729;2ClO  4  &#8211;  encapsulate DMF molecule(s)A nanoreactor, with  R1  &#8729;2ClO  4  &#8211;  and  L  &#8208;histidine (  L  &#8208;His) as the components, was fabricated using a neutralization method. The nanoreactor could detoxify paraoxon in 30 min.  L  &#8208;His played a vital role in this process. Paraoxonase is a well&#8208;known enzyme used for pesticide degradation. The Ellman&#8217;s reagent was used to determine the percentage inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the presence of the nanoreactor. The results indicated that the nanoreactor inhibited AChE inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Preparation of functionalized carbon&#8208;coated cobalt nanoparticles with sulfonated arene derivatives, a study on surface functionalization and stability</title>
      <dc:description>The functionalization of magnetic nanoparticles has been an important field in the last decade due to the versatile applications in catalysis and biomedicine. Generally, a high degree of functionalities on the surface of the nanoparticles is desired. In this study, covalent functionalization of various aromatic sulfonic acids on carbon&#8208;coated cobalt nanoparticles are investigated on surface functionalization yield and stability. The nanoparticles are prepared  via  covalent linkage of an  in situ  generated diazonium on the graphene&#8208;like surface. Adsorption and wash experiments were performed to confirm a covalent bonding of the naphthalene derivatives on the nanoparticle surface. With an increased number of sulfonic acid groups on the aromatic compound a significantly lower loading is observed on the corresponding functionalized nanoparticles. This can be counteracted by a change of nitrite species. With this method, nanoparticles with a high number of sulfonic acid groups can be produced.</dc:description>

      <title>The Cascade Reactions of Indigo with Propargyl Substrates for Heterocyclic and Photophysical Diversity</title>
      <dc:description>
One&#8208;pot domino reactions of indigo with propargyl derivatives produce structurally diverse heterocycles including new pyrazinodiindolodiones, azepinodiindolones, and oxazinoindolones. Mechanistic and DFT studies show propargyl moieties behaving as electrophiles when terminally substituted, thereby competing with leaving groups. Photophysical properties, including transient absorption spectroscopy reveal polarity&#8208;dependent excited state relaxation pathways, fluorescence, and triplet formation. More information can be found in the Full Paper by P.&#8197;A. Keller et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202003662).

      <dc:description>A new mode of aromatic metamorphosis has been developed, which allows thiophenes and their benzo&#8208;fused derivatives to be converted to a variety of exotic heteroles. This transformation involves 1) the efficient generation of key 1,4&#8208;dianions by means of desulfurative dilithiation with lithium powder and 2) the subsequent trapping of the dianions with heteroatom electrophiles in a one&#8208;pot manner.

      <title>Donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adducts: Exploring the effects of ionic character</title>
      <dc:description>The effects of solution&#8208;state dielectric and intermolecular interactions on the degree of charge separation provides a route to understand the switching properties and concentration dependence of donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs). Using solvatochromic analysis of the open form DASA in conjunction with X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and computational theory we analyzed the ionic character of a series of DASAs. First and third generation architectures lead to a higher zwitterionic resonance contribution of the open form and a zwitterionic closed form while second generation architecture poses less charge&#8208;separated open form and neutral closed forms. This can be correlated to equilibrium control and photoswitching solvent compatibility. Due to the high contribution of the zwitterionic resonance form of a first and third generation DASA we demonstrate external control over their switching kinetics by ion concentration, while second generation DASAs are less affected. Importantly, the ionic character of DASAs correlates to the previously observed concentration dependence and is not universal to DASA.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>We have studied the dynamics of the retained species on ZSM&#8208;5 and SAPO&#8208;18 zeolites using a combination of temperature&#8208;programmed desorption/oxidation,  ex situ  analysis and  in situ  FTIR spectroscopic measurements over the entire conversion range, using fixed&#8208;bed and spectroscopic cell reactors, in continuous and discontinuous mode. Our results point to the appropriateness of the combined methodologies to track the interconversion of active into deactivating species. We found a statistically relevant (supported by linear regression and multivariate analysis) association of our observations using the different complementary methodologies. The kinetics of this interconversion depends on the initial conversion (tuned by acidity and space time) and microporous topology, and involve: (i) in the ZSM&#8208;5 catalysts, the diffusion of monocyclic aromatics toward the exterior of the zeolite to form coke and (ii) in the SAPO&#8208;18 catalysts, the obstruction of the cages by aromatics that grow up to tetracyclic aromatics islands.</dc:description>

      <title>Cold resistant nitrogen/sulfur dual&#8208;doped graphene fiber supercapacitors with solar&#8208;thermal energy conversion effect</title>
      <dc:description>Though graphene fiber&#8208;based supercapacitors are promising for wearable electronic devices, low energy density of electrodes and poor cold resistance of aqueous electrolytes limit their wide applications in cold environments. Herein, porous nitrogen/sulfur dual&#8208;doped graphene fibers (NS&#8208;GFs) are synthesized via hydrothermal self&#8208;assembly followed by thermal annealing, exhibiting an excellent capacitive performance of 401 F cm&#8208;3 at 400 mA cm&#8208;3 because of the synergistic effect of heteroatom dual&#8208;doping. The assembled symmetric all&#8208;solid&#8208;state supercapacitor with polyvinyl alcohol/H2SO4/graphene oxide gel electrolyte exhibits high capacitance of 221 F cm&#8208;3 and high energy density of 7.7 mWh cm&#8208;3 at 80 mA cm&#8208;3. Interestingly, solar&#8208;thermal energy conversion of the electrolyte with 0.1 wt% graphene oxide extends operating temperature range of the supercapacitor to 0 oC. Furthermore, the photocatalysis effect of the dual&#8208;doped heteroatoms increases the capacitance of NS&#8208;GFs. At an ambient temperature of 0 oC, the capacitance increases from 0 to 182 F cm&#8208;3 under 1&#8208;sun irradiation because of the excellent solar light absorption and efficient solar&#8208;thermal energy conversion of graphene oxide, preventing the aqueous electrolyte from freezing. The flexible supercapacitor exhibits long cycle life, good bending resistance, reliable scalability, and ability to power visual electronics, showing great potentials for outdoor electronics in cold environments.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Two sterically crowded benzo&#8208;tetrathiafulvalene (BTTF)&#8208;annulated expanded porphyrins (  BTTF7&#8211;F  and  BTTF8  ) have been synthesized.

This finding stands in contrast to what was observed in the previously reported figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight conformer of BTTF&#8208;annulated [28]hexaphyrin &#160; (  BTTF6  ), where typical &#960;&#8208;&#960; * electronic transition from HOMO to LUMO was observed. However, core expansion in  BTTF7&#8211;F  and  BTTF8  makes the oligopyrrole macrocyclic cores relatively more electron deficient, facilitating the effective intramolecular CT process. Comparative electrochemical investigations revealed that the current generated at the oxidative region is directly proportional to the number of TTF units attached with the macrocyclic core. This work demonstrates the control of intramolecular CT process by incremental addition of TTF units to the macrocyclic core. Facile multielectron electrochemical oxidations of these expanded porphyrins suggest that they behave like potential multielectron reservoirs.</dc:description>

      <title>Intermediate valence states in lanthanide compounds</title>
      <dc:description>Over more than 50 years, intermediate valence states in lanthanide compounds have often resulted in unexpected or puzzling spectroscopic and magnetic properties. Such experimental singularities could not be rationalised until new theoretical models involving multiconfigurational electronic ground states and  ab initio  calculations were established. In this minireview, we highlight the different singularities that have been observed among lanthanide complexes, detail the models used to rationalise them and show how such electronic effects may be adjusted depending on energy and symmetry considerations. Understanding and tuning the ground state multiconfigurational behaviour in lanthanide complexes may open new doors to modular and unusual reactivities.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of carbapenems containing peptidoglycan&#8208;mimetics and inhibition of the cross&#8208;linking activity of a transpeptidase of the L,D specificity</title>
      <dc:description>The carbapenem class of &#946;&#8208;lactams has been optimized against Gram&#8208;negative bacteria producing extended&#8208;spectrum &#946;&#8208;lactamases by introducing substituents at position C  2  . Carbapenems are currently investigated for the treatment of tuberculosis since these drugs are potent covalent inhibitors of L,D&#8208;transpeptidases involved in mycobacterial cell wall assembly. We sought to optimize carbapenems for inactivation of these unusual targets by exploiting the nucleophilicity of the C  8  hydroxyl group to introduce chemical diversity. Since &#946;&#8208;lactams are structure analogues of peptidoglycan precursors, the substituents were chosen to increase similarity between the drug and the substrate. Fourteen peptido&#8208;carbapenems were efficiently synthesized. They were more effective than the reference drug, meropenem, due to the positive impact of a phenethylthio substituent introduced at position C  2  but the peptidomimetics added at position C  8  did not further improve activity. Thus, position C  8  can be modified to modulate the pharmacokinetic properties of highly efficient carbapenems.</dc:description>

      <title>Spin state tunes oxygen atom transfer towards FeIVO formation in FeII complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Oxo&#8208;iron(IV) complexes bearing tetradentate ligands have been extensively studied as models for the active oxidants in non heme iron dependent enzymes.

      <title>Benzothiadiazole substituted aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes: two&#8208;photon absorption enhancement for improved optical limiting performances in the SWIR range.</title>
      <dc:description>Aza&#8208;boron dipyrromethenes (aza&#8208;BODIPYs) presenting a benzothiadiazole substitution on upper positions are described. The strong electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of the benzothiadiazole moiety permits to enhance the accepting strength and improve the delocalisation of the aza&#8208;BODIPY core to attain a significant degree of electronic communication between the lower donating groups and the upper accepting groups. The nature of the intramolecular charge transfer is studied both experimentally and theoretically. Linear spectroscopy highlighted the strongly red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission of the synthesized molecules with recorded fluorescence spectra over 1000 nm. Nonlinear optical properties were also investigated. Strong enhancement of the two&#8208;photon absorption of the substituted dyes compared to the unsubstituted one (up to 4520 GM at 1300 nm) results in a ca. 15 &#8208; 20% improvement of the optical power limiting performances. These dyes are therefore a good starting point for further improvement of optical power limiting in the SWIR range.</dc:description>

      <title>Cyclo&#8208;Ketal Xanthene Dyes: A New Class of Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorophores for Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Live Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Newly emerging super&#8208;resolution imaging techniques provide opportunities for precise observations on cellular microstructures. However, they also impose severe demands on fluorophores. Here, we develop a new series of NIR xanthene dyes, named as KRhs, by replacing the 10&#8208;position O of rhodamines with a cyclo&#8208;ketal. KRhs display intense NIR emission peaked at 700 nm with fluorescence quantum yields up to 0.64. More importantly, they, without the aid of any enhancing buffer, exhibit stochastic fluorescence off&#8208;on switches to support time&#8208;resolved localization of single&#8208;fluorophore. KRhs are functionalized into KRh&#8208;MitoFix, KRh&#8208;Mem and KRh&#8208;Halo that demonstrate mitochondria, plasma membrane and fusion protein targeting ability respectively. Consequently, these KRh probes demonstrate straightforward usage for super&#8208;resolution imaging of these targets in live cells. Therefore, KRhs merit future development for fluorescence labeling and super&#8208;resolution imaging in the NIR region.</dc:description>

      <title>Triggering G&#8208;quadruplex conformation&#8208;switching with [7]helicenes</title>
      <dc:description>The dynamic interplay between two types of chiral structures; fully conjugated racemic hetero[7]helicenes and DNA strands prone to fold into G&#8208;quadruplex structures is described. Both the [7]helicenes and the G&#8208;quadruplex DNA structures exist in more than one conformation in solution. We show that the structures interact with and stabilise each other, mutually amplifying and stabilising certain conformations at increased temperatures. The [7]helicene ligands  L1  and  L2  stabilise the parallel conformation of  k&#8208;ras  significantly, whereas hybrid (K  +  ) and antiparallel (Na  +  )  h&#8208;telo  G&#8208;quadruplexes are stabilised upon conformational switching into altered G&#8208;quadruplex conformations. Both  L1  and  L2  induce parallel G&#8208;quadruplexes from hybrid structures (K  +  ) and  L1  induce hybrid G&#8208;quadruplexes from antiparallel conformations (Na  +  ). Enantioselective binding of one helicene enantiomer is observed for helicene ligand  L2  , and VTCD melting experiments are used to estimate the racemisation barrier of the helicene.</dc:description>

The tridentate  N,N,O  ligand coordination observed in their X&#8208;ray crystal structures remains intact and well&#8208;defined in MeCN and CH  2  Cl  2  solution. Reacting  2  with NaSPh affords a non&#8208;heme zinc thiolate complex, [Zn(L)(SPh)] (  4  ), that is relevant to isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS) biomimicry. Cyclic voltammetry studies demonstrate the ligand&#8217;s redox non&#8208;innocence, where phenolate oxidation is the first electrochemical response observed in  K&#8208;L  ,  2  and  4  .

The nucleation of  4  instead is slightly negative dependent on the energy but dependent on the mixing speed, while its growth is mostly independent of any influence. We were able to influence the reaction pathways by seeding the mixture with a small amount of powdery  4  . The formation of  4  is very likely an auto&#8208;catalytic process.  3  instead is metastable. It can be stabilized by energy, which beside mechanochemistry can also be achieved by temperature.

      <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Self&#8208;Sorting Hybrid Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded/Metal&#8208;Coordinated Cage</title>
      <dc:description>We report the self&#8208;assembly of a unique molecular container: hybrid hydrogen&#8208;bonded/metal&#8208;coordinated cage where both hydrogen&#8208;bonding and metal&#8208;coordination form the crucial part of the topology.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We report the self&#8208;assembly of a unique molecular container: hybrid hydrogen&#8208;bonded/metal&#8208;coordinated cage where both hydrogen&#8208;bonding and metal&#8208;coordination form the crucial part of the topology.

      <title>Ni2P interlayer and Mn doping synergistically expedite the HER kinetics of Co2P</title>
      <dc:description>Transition metal phosphide is regarded as one of the most promising candidates to replace noble&#8208;metal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts. Nevertheless, the controllable design and synthesis of transition metal phosphide electrocatalyst with efficient and stable electrochemical performance are still very challenging.

Notably, both the incorporation of Mn and introduction of the Ni  2  P interlayer promote Co atoms to carry more electrons, which is beneficial to reduce the force of the Co&#8208;H bond and optimize the adsorption energy of hydrogen intermediate (&#9474;&#8710;G  H*  &#9474;), thereby making MnCoP/NiP/NF exhibit outstanding HER performance with onset overpotential and Tafel slope as low as 31.2 mV and 61 mV dec  &#8208;1  , respectively in 1 M KOH electrolyte.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Shigella sonnei  surface polysaccharides are well&#8208;established protective antigens against this major cause of diarrhoeal disease. They also qualify as unique zwitterionic polysaccharides (ZPSs) featuring a disaccharide repeating unit made of two 1,2&#8208;  trans  linked rare aminodeoxy sugars, a 2&#8208;acetamido&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;l&#8208;altruronic acid (l&#8208;Alt  p  NAcA) and a 2&#8208;acetamido&#8208;4&#8208;amino&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trideoxy&#8208;d&#8208;galactopyranose (AAT). Herein, the stereoselective synthesis of  S. sonnei  oligosaccharides comprising two and three repeating units is reported for the first time. Several sets of up to seven protecting groups were explored, shedding light on the singular conformational behavior of protected altrosamine and altruronic residues. A disaccharide building block equipped with three distinct  N  &#8208;protecting groups and featuring the uronate moiety already in place was designed to accomplish the iterative high yielding glycosylation at the axial 4&#8208;OH of the altruronate component and achieve the challenging full deprotection step. Key to the successful strategy was the use of a diacetyl strategy whereby the  N  &#8208;acetamido group of the l&#8208;Alt  p  NAcA is masked in the form of an imide.</dc:description>

      <title>Enantioselective cleavage of cyclobutanols through Ir&#8208;catalyzed&#160;C&#8208;C bond activation: Mechanistic and synthetic aspects</title>
      <dc:description>The Ir&#8208;catalyzed conversion of prochiral&#160;  tert  &#8208;cyclo&#173;butanols to&#160; b &#8208;methyl&#8208;substituted ketones proceeds under comparably mild conditions in toluene (45&#8211;110&#176;C) and is particularly suited for the enantio&#173;selective desymmetrization of&#160; b &#8208;oxy&#8208;substituted substrates to give products with a quaternary chirality center with up to 95%&#160;  ee  &#160;using DTBM&#8208;SegPhos as a chiral ligand. Deuteration experi&#173;ments and kinetic isotope effect measurements revealed major mechanistic differences to related Rh(I)&#8208;catalyzed transformations. Supported by DFT calculations we propose the initial formation of an Ir(III) hydride intermediate which then undergoes a&#160; b &#8208;C elimination (C&#8208;C bond activation) prior to reductive C&#8208;H elimination. The computational model also allows the prediction of the stereochemical outcome. The Ir&#8208;catalyzed cyclobutanol cleavage is broadly applicable but fails for substrates bearing strongly coordinating groups. The method is of particular value for the stereo&#8208;controlled synthesis of substituted chromanes related to the tocopherols and other natural products.</dc:description>

      <title>A series of bisamide&#8208;substituted diacetylenes exhibiting terminal alkyl odd&#8208;even parity effect on mechano&#8208;activation for the subsequent photopolymerization property</title>
      <dc:description>Diacetylene derivatives exhibit solid&#8208;state polymerization to polydiacetylene initiated by UV light or &#947;&#8208;ray irradiation. The activation of the photopolymerization highly relies on the monomer diynes arrangement.

The origin of this unique phenomenon was apparently related to the pressure&#8208;sensitive crystalline transition in DAs, but the molecular mechanism remains elusive. To obtain the insight, we herein present a series of DAs with varying terminal alkyl spacer length, and their molecular structural effect on the intermolecular hydrogen bonding and steric repulsion. In pristine states, even&#8208;parity DAs were inactive upon UV irradiation (&#955;=254 nm) unless external pressure was given. By contrast, odd&#8208;parity DAs were easily polymerized upon UV irradiation without pressure application. However, the pressure&#8208;induced crystalline phase transition exhibiting photopolymerization was valid for all DAs regardless of their alkyl spacer length. A systematic investigation revealed that the terminal alkyl spacer length, especially its odd&#8208;even parity plays a key role to determine the intrinsic intermolecular hydrogen bonding nature of DA crystals and resultant molecular packing. In addition, the relevant thermochromic behaviour was also observed from photopolymerized polydiacetylenes.</dc:description>

      <title>An Antimony(III) Fluoride Oxalate With Large Birefringence</title>
      <dc:description>Birefringent materials play a key role in modulating the polarization of light and thus in optical communication as well as the laser techniques and science. Designing new, excellent birefringent materials remains a challenge. In this work, we designed and synthesized the first antimony(III) fluoride oxalate birefringent material, KSb  2  C  2  O  4  F  5  , by a combination of delocalized  &#960;  &#8208;conjugated [C  2  O  4  ]  2&#8208;  groups, stereochemical active Sb  3+  cations, and the most electronegative F element. The [C  2  O  4  ]  2&#8208;  groups are not in an optimal arrangement in the crystal structure of KSb  2  C  2  O  4  F  5  . Remarkably, KSb  2  C  2  O  4  F  5  exhibits a large birefringence (&#916;  n  = 0.170 @546 nm) that is even better than the well&#8208;known commercial birefringent material  &#945;  &#8208;BaB  2  O  4  , whereas the latter features an optimal arrangement of  &#960;  &#8208;conjugated [B  3  O  6  ]  3&#8208;  groups. Based on the first&#8208;principles calculations, this prominent birefringence should be attributed to the alliance of planar  &#960;  &#8208;conjugated [C  2  O  4  ]  2&#8208;  anions, highly distorted SbO  2  F  2  and SbOF  3  polyhedra with stereochemical activity lone pair. Combination of lone pair electrons and  &#960;  &#8208;conjugated systems enables to boost the birefringence to a large extent and will help to develop high&#8208;performance birefringent materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Mechanical modulation of the solid&#8208;state luminescence of tricarbonyl rhenium(I) complexes through the interplay between two triplet excited states</title>
      <dc:description>Mechanoresponsive luminescence (MRL) active materials promise smart devices for sensing, optoelectronics, and security. Herein is the first report on the MRL&#8208;activity of two Re(I) complexes, opening up new opportunities for applications in this field. Both complexes exhibit marked solid&#8208;state luminescence enhancement (SLE) effect. Pristine microcrystalline powders emit in the yellow&#8208;green region, grinding led to an amorphous phase with concomitant emission red&#8208;shift and shrinking of photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields and lifetimes. Quantum chemical calculations revealed the existence of two low&#8208;lying triplet excited states of very close energy levels, i.e. 3IL and 3MLCT, having respectively almost pure intraligand and metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer character. Transition between these states could be promoted by rotation around the pyridyltriazole&#8208;phenylbenzoxazole (pyta&#8208;PBO) bond. In microcrystals, where rotations are hindered, the 3IL state induces prominent PL emission at short wavelengths. Upon grinding, rotation is facilitated and the transition to the 3MLCT state results in a larger proportion of long&#8208;wavelength PL. FTIR spectroscopic analyses and variable temperature PL spectroscopy showed that the opening of vibrational modes favours non&#8208;radiative deactivation of the triplet states in the amorphous phase. In solutions, PL only arises from the 3MLCT state. The same mechanism accounts for the spectroscopic differences observed when passing from crystals to amorphous powders, and then to solutions, clarifying the link between SLE and MRL for these complexes.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Conventional histology is a destructive technique based on the evaluation of 2D slices of a 3D biopsy. By using 3D X&#8208;ray histology these obstacles can be overcome, but their application is still restricted due to the inherently low attenuation properties of soft tissue. In order to solve this problem, the tissue can be stained before X&#8208;ray computed tomography (CT) imaging to enhance the soft tissue X&#8208;ray contrast. Evaluation of brominated fluorescein salts revealed a mutual influence of the number of bromine atoms and the cations applied on the achieved contrast enhancement. The dibromo fluorescein barium salt turned out to be the ideal X&#8208;ray contrast agent, allowing for 3D imaging and subsequent complementing counterstaining applying standard histological techniques.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules in solution generally occurs due to either an enthalpic or an entropic gain; however, designing &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems that simultaneously exhibit enthalpically and entropically favorable self&#8208;assembly behavior is challenging. Herein, we disclose the self&#8208;assembly behavior of tetraazatetrathia[8]circulenes, which is driven by both enthalpy and entropy. A single&#8208;crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction analysis demonstrated that molecules of these tetraazatetrathia[8]circulenes form face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacked dimers&#160; with a 1D columnar structure due to the circularly arranged dipole moments. Importantly, concentration&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent&#160;  1  H NMR spectra revealed that the formation of self&#8208;assemblies of tetraazatetrathia[8]circulenes in chloroform and methanol is favored by both enthalpic and entropic factors. The unique association behavior is due to the presence of sp  2  &#8208;hybridized nitrogen atoms, which weakly coordinate to the hydrogen atoms of these solvents and reduce the&#160; &#960; &#8208;electron density of the circulene cores.</dc:description>

      <title>Boron&#8208;Ligand Cooperation: The Concept and Applications</title>
      <dc:description>The term boron&#8208;ligand cooperation was introduced to describe a specific mode of action by which certain metal&#8208;free systems activate chemical bonds. The main characteristic of this mode of action is that one covalently bound substituent at the boron is actively involved in the bond activation process and changes to a datively bound ligand in the course of the bond activation. Within this review, we reflect on how the term boron&#8208;ligand cooperation evolved and discuss examples of bond activation by boron&#8208;ligand cooperation. We furthermore show that systems that operate via boron&#8208;ligand cooperation can complement the reactivity of classic intramolecular frustrated Lewis pairs and summarize applications of this new concept for metal&#8208;free catalysis.</dc:description>

      <title>Structural and electronic control of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)benzotriazole bidentate ligand in copper chemistry with application to catalysis in the A3 coupling reaction</title>
      <dc:description>We introduce the hybrid bidentate 1&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)benzotriazole (pyb) ligand in well&#8208;characterized 3d&#8208;transition metal catalysis. Specifically, [Cu(II)(OTf)  2  (pyb)  2  ]2(CH  3  CN) (  1  ) enables the synthesis of a wide range of propargylamines, via the A  3  coupling reaction, at room temperature, in the absence of additives. Experimental and high&#8208;level theoretical calculations suggest that the bridging N atom of the ligand imposes exclusive  trans  &#8208;coordination at Cu and allows ligand rotation, while the N atom of the pyridine group modulates charge distribution and flux, thus orchestrating structural and electronic pre&#8208;catalyst control permitting alkyne binding with simultaneous activation of the C&#8211;H bond via a transient Cu(I) species.</dc:description>

      <title>Fluorescent Imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrimidine Compounds as Biocompatible Organic Photosensitizers that Generate Singlet Oxygen: A Potential Tool for Phototheranostics</title>
      <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy has been used to treat a variety of diseases, however there is a continuous search for new biocompatible photosensitizers. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that imidazo[1,2&#8208;  a  ]pyrimidine compounds are able to generate singlet oxygen species, and can act as photosensitizers in the intracellular environment. Our results show that this class of compounds absorbs and emits in the 400&#8208;500 nm region, presents low cytotoxicity in the dark, is efficiently uptaken by cells, is fluorescent in the intracellular medium, and generates singlet oxygen upon irradiation killing cancer cells within 2 h at low concentration (2.0 &#181;M). The imidazo[1,2&#8208;  a  ]pyrimidine compounds are a potential new tool for phototheranostics because they can be simultaneously used for fluorescence imaging and photodynamic therapy.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Photodynamic therapy has been used to treat a variety of diseases, however there is a continuous search for new biocompatible photosensitizers. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that imidazo[1,2&#8208;  a  ]pyrimidine compounds are able to generate singlet oxygen species, and can act as photosensitizers in the intracellular environment. Our results show that this class of compounds absorbs and emits in the 400&#8208;500 nm region, presents low cytotoxicity in the dark, is efficiently uptaken by cells, is fluorescent in the intracellular medium, and generates singlet oxygen upon irradiation killing cancer cells within 2 h at low concentration (2.0 &#181;M). The imidazo[1,2&#8208;  a  ]pyrimidine compounds are a potential new tool for phototheranostics because they can be simultaneously used for fluorescence imaging and photodynamic therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
