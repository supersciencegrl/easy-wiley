         <title>Moisture&#8208;enabled Electricity Generation From a Single&#8208;layer Composite CNT&#8208;Polymer Membrane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work focuses on the development of single&#8208;layer composite membranes containing a hydrophilic polymeric matrix enriched with various types of carbon nanotubes (single&#8208;, double&#8208;, and multi&#8208;walled CNTs), through an environmentally benign process. The membranes hold potential as low&#8208;budget and self&#8208;sustaining energy systems in the field of moisture&#8208;enabled electricity generators (MEGs).








Abstract
Clean and renewable power sources are crucial toward the development of sustainable energy technologies, to address the global energy demand. Moisture&#8208;enabled electricity generators (MEGs) have emerged as promising candidates to harness ambient low&#8208;grade energy stored in the humidity of the atmosphere. In this study, single&#8208;layer composite membranes were developed, consisting of a hydrophilic cross&#8208;linked polymeric matrix of sodium poly(4&#8208;styrene sulfonate&#8208;co&#8208;glycidyl methacrylate) (P(SSNa&#8208;co&#8208;GMA)) and polyacrylic acid (PAA), and incorporating various types of carbon nanotubes (single&#8208;, double&#8208;, and multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes). These composite membranes can spontaneously absorb humidity and display mixed conductivity in a range of relative humidity (RH) environments. The combination of high swelling capacity, hydrophilic surface, and interconnected nanoscale pathways facilitates the formation of a strong ion concentration gradient under humid conditions, leading to higher and more stable voltage output. For example, MEGs based on MWCNTs reaches &#8764;0.65&#160;V. These findings indicate the importance of fine&#8208;tuned morphology and nanotube dispersion in designing efficient MEG devices, as low&#8208;cost and self&#8208;sustaining energy systems.

         <title>Biodegradation of Benzene&#8208;Dicarboxylic Acid Ester Isomers by a Thermally Activated Esterase from Desulfurellaceae Bacterium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The newly identified esterase DeEst catalyzes the hydrolysis of three regioisomers of benzene&#8208;dicarboxylic acid esters. In particular, phthalic acid esters (PAEs) can be converted into phthalic acid (PA). DeEst exhibits thermostability and an uncommon thermal activation effect.








Abstract
Esterases play a crucial role in the degradation of phthalic acid esters (PAEs), the common persistent organic pollutants and endocrine disrupting chemicals. However, only a few esterases for PAEs degradation have been characterized. In this study, a novel esterase from Desulfurellaceae bacterium (DeEst) has been identified. We found its hydrolytic activity toward three regioisomers of benzene&#8208;dicarboxylic acid esters (i.e., diethyl phthalate, diethyl isophthalate, and diethyl terephthalate). Notably, DeEst is capable of hydrolyzing diethyl phthalate and other PAEs to phthalic acid (PA). The biochemical characterization of DeEst was also investigated. DeEst exhibited strong thermal stability and demonstrated an uncommon thermal activation effect, highlighting its considerable potential for practical applications.

The graphical abstract summarizes the review &#8220;Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Strategies for the &#946;&#8208;Arylation of &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids: An Overview&#8221;, highlighting representative Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed methods for the &#946;&#8208;arylation of &#945;&#8208;amino acids. Key mechanistic features, substrate diversity, and synthetic relevance of these transformations are showcased.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H activation has been linked to amino acids for decades. Peptides and &#945;$\alpha $&#8208;amino acids (&#945;&#8208;AAs) have been used as substrates, directing groups (DGs) and ligands, significantly expanding and broadening the definition of metallo&#8208; and organo&#8208;catalysis. This mini&#8208;review focuses on strategies for &#946;&#8208;arylation of &#945;&#8208;AAs involving Pd(II)&#8208;mediated activation of the &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H sigma bond. After a brief introduction in Section 1, strategies exploiting auxiliary bidentate DGs to address the Pd(II)&#8208;mediated C&#9472;H activation are discussed in Section 2. The related Ligand&#8208;controlled processes are treated in Section 3 and Section 4 highlight the most recent atom&#8208;economic developments in peptide late&#8208;stage functionalization (LSF) proceeding via Pd(II)&#8208;mediated &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H activation of a precise &#945;$\alpha $&#8208;AA residue along the peptide sequence.

         <title>Enantioselective Desymmetrization by Chiral Bifunctional H&#8208;Bonding Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective desymmetrization has emerged as a highly efficient and conceptually elegant strategy for the construction of chiral molecules from readily available prochiral substrates. This review focuses on recent developments in organocatalytic desymmetrization reactions, with particular emphasis on approaches involving bifunctional activation through hydrogen bonding.








Abstract
Enantioselective desymmetrization has emerged as an effective method for generating highly enriched chiral molecules from achiral compounds. In recent years, organocatalysis has played an increasingly prominent role in this field, offering metal&#8208;free and environmentally benign alternatives to traditional asymmetric catalysis. This review focuses on organocatalytic approaches in desymmetrization reactions that utilize bifunctional hydrogen activation of the substrate by a chiral organocatalyst. The most common types of chiral bifunctional organocatalysts include cinchona alkaloids and their derivatives, such as thioureas, sulfonamides, and squaramides. The following text provides an overview of the enantioselective desymmetrization methods that have been described to date for meso&#8208;anhydrides, meso&#8208;diols, amines, small heterocyclic rings, and various carbonyl compound derivatives.

         <title>Tailoring Pore Size in Anionic MOFs Toward Enhanced Selective Adsorption of Organic Dye Pollutants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pore size of MOFs can be successfully adjusted by altering the solvent and temperature of the reaction. The adsorption isotherm results of the cationic dye methylene blue show that the maximum adsorption capacity of the optimized MOF increased by approximately 2.45 times.

Organic dye pollutants pose a serious threat to ecosystems and human health, whereas there still exist challenges in efficient and selective adsorption of them due to the difficulty in structure tunability of traditional adsorption materials. Based on the tailorable pore structure of anionic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), the pore size can be optimized to match the dye molecules through a solvothermal control strategy, thereby achieving efficient adsorption. Herein, the pore size of anionic MOFs was modulated by varying solvents and temperature, facilitating high&#8208;performance selective adsorption of cationic dye via a large&#8208;pore size effect. The optimized MOF (Bio&#8208;MOF&#8208;100) of large pore size achieved a methylene blue adsorption capacity is high to 443.01&#160;mg/g, which is approximately 2.45 times higher than that of the MOF (Bio&#8208;MOF&#8208;1) before pore regulation. Using a mixed matrix membrane (MMM) strategy, the optimized MOF was mixed with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) to form a membrane. The membrane is not only portable and recyclable, but also inherits the characteristics of MOFs, enabling selective adsorption of cationic dyes. Its maximum adsorption capacity for methylene blue is 141.78&#160;mg/g. These results provide an example for the design and utility of largely&#8208;pore MOFs for targeted pollutants adsorption.

         <title>Low&#8208; Temperature Transformations in Amorphous Silica Bilayers on Ru(0001) After Crystal&#8208;Glass Transition: Closer Look</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work we report on the ring opening of the silica film as studied by fast&#8208;scanning scanning tunneling microscopy together with density functional calculations. The results reveal the influence of the metal support on the transformation energetics.








Abstract
The crystal&#8208;glass transition concerning silicon dioxide has been a topic of intense research. It has been possible to prepare a bilayer silica film on a metal substrate and study the corresponding transition in real space using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). While the initial trigger of the transition has been identified as a so&#8208;called Stone&#8211;Wales ring&#8208;opening process, which requires rather high energies/temperatures, a question has been, whether there are similar follow&#8208;up processes, which require much less energy and thus rather moderate temperatures. Although observations have been reported using electron microscopy, it remains unclear whether, in this case, the modifications were initiated by the measurement itself. Here, we report on a fast&#8208;scanning STM study, allowing a study in real space and indicating structural transformations at room temperature. The experimental results are supported by demanding density functional calculations, which allow for an understanding of the involved ring structure modifying processes. The calculations also reveal the influence of the metal support on the transformation energetics.

         <title>Enantioselective Catalytic 1,2&#8208;Benzoxazolyl Migration for Tertiary &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Ester Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral Lewis acid and bifunctional squaramide&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent benzilic ester rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;diketones has been developed, enabling the construction of optically active tertiary &#945;&#8208;hydroxy esters with high enantioselectivity and functional group versatility, along with the synthesis of a novel chiral Boox ligand for asymmetric electrocatalysis, while DFT calculations elucidated the hemiketal&#8208;initiated mechanism and key transition states governing enantioselectivity.








Abstract
Asymmetric catalytic rearrangement, particularly the enantioselective benzilic ester rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;diketones, represents a potent synthetic tool for cleaving C&#9472;C bonds to generate optically active tertiary &#945;&#8208;hydroxy esters. However, enantioselective benzilic ester rearrangement involving a 1,2&#8208;heterocycle shift presents significant challenges owing to inadequate enantiomeric differentiation and steric hindrance associated with tertiary alcohols. In this study, we employed chiral Lewis acid and bifunctional squaramide catalysts for enantioconvergent benzilic ester rearrangement, achieving high enantioselectivity in the construction of tertiary alcohols with chemically versatile functional groups and the synthesis of a novel chiral benzoxazole&#8211;oxazoline (Boox) ligand for asymmetric electrocatalysis. DFT calculations elucidated a hemiketal&#8208;initiated reaction mechanism, pivotal 1,2&#8208;heterocycle shift transition states, and catalytic interactions that govern the increased enantioselectivity of the enantioconvergent benzilic ester rearrangement, furnishing crucial insights into the underlying mechanism.

         <title>Double&#8208;Network Soy Protein Adhesives with Enhanced Water Retention and Bonding Strength</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchical dual&#8208;network soy protein adhesive combines chitosan's compliant supramolecular network (hydrogen bonding/electrostatic interactions) for 430% enhanced precure water retention with a stiff covalent crosslinked network formed during curing for 445% improved postcure bonding strength, successfully resolving the traditional trade&#8208;off between these properties in bio&#8208;based adhesives.








Abstract
Developing soy protein adhesives with high water retention and strong bonding strength is essential. Such materials can serve as a sustainable alternative to petroleum&#8208;based formaldehyde adhesives in wood panel manufacturing. However, a trade&#8208;off between precure water retention and postcure bonding strength remains a major challenge, and current strategies rarely achieve simultaneous enhancement of both properties. Inspired by the multi&#8208;enhancement mechanisms of double&#8209;network systems, we established a hierarchical dual&#8209;network adhesive system. It involves the self&#8208;assembly of chitosan into a compliant supramolecular framework via dynamic hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, along with the additional formation of a stiff covalent crosslinked network during curing. This design achieves synergistic optimization of water retention and bonding strength. The &#8220;skeleton&#8211;tentacle&#8221; structure formed by functionalized chitosan significantly enhanced water retention by 430% and was crucial to forming the dual&#8208;network structure, improving wet shear strength by 445% and work of adhesion by 2133%. Additionally, the adhesive exhibited excellent mildew resistance and flame retardancy. The global warming potential was only 1.4&#160;kg CO2 eq, significantly lower than urea&#8211;formaldehyde and phenol&#8211;formaldehyde resins. This design provides a novel approach for developing high&#8208;performance bio&#8208;based adhesives and is expected to advance its practical application.

         <title>Variability of a Non&#8208;Centrosymmetric Tecto&#8208;Borosulfate: Introduction of Various Molecular Cations into BiX[B(SO4)2]4 (X&#160; = &#160;H3O+, NO2+, NH4+, NO+)</title>

         <dc:description>
To date, Bi(H3O)[B(SO)2]4 is only the second structure type containing a 3D anion within borosulfate chemistry. In this contribution three more representatives were synthesized, formally replacing oxonium by the molecular cations nitrosonium, nitronium, and ammonium. The structures crystallize homeotypically to the very first compound. A careful adjustment of the educts even allows mixed representatives.








Abstract
Although the number of borosulfates increased strongly over the past years, structures comprising a 3D anionic framework are still scarce. Herein, with BiX[B(SO4)2]4 (X&#160; = &#160;NH4+, NO2+, NO+) we present three new representatives. The bismuth borosulfates were synthesized under solvothermal condition and crystallize homeotypically to Bi(H3O)[B(SO4)2]4 in the tetragonal space group I4&#175;$\bar 4$ (Nr.82) (a&#160;=&#160;11.827(6) &#8211; 11.908(1) &#197;, c&#160;=&#160;8.1160(2) &#8211; 8.1315(6) &#197;, Z&#160;=&#160;2). Via all vertices connected BS4 supertetrahedra reveal a zeolite type like structure like its found for the tectosilicate K1.14[Mg0.57Si1.43O4] emphasizing their close relationship. Underlining the weak coordination behavior, for the first&#8208;time nitrosonium and nitrosylium cations are introduced into borosulfate chemistry. SHG measurements confirm the absence of an inversion center and show a nonlinear optical response with intensities up to 1.4 times higher than KDP. Furthermore, the titled compounds were characterized thoroughly by both single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and thermal analysis.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Single&#8208;Crystalline Covalent Organic Frameworks: The Use of Modulator for Reversible Bond Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 55, October 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as versatile materials owing to their ordered crystalline structures, tunable topologies, and high surface areas. Accurate structural determination is essential for understanding the correlation between their structural features and physical properties. This review emphasizes recent progress in growing single&#8208;crystalline COFs via modulator&#8208;assisted strategies, enabling SCXRD analysis and expanding their functional applications.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), notable for their well&#8208;organized crystalline structures, varied framework topologies, and large surface areas, have been actively studied for diverse applications. Their distinct properties are related primarily to their crystalline frameworks; therefore, obtaining accurate structural information is important. Notable advances in the structural analysis of COFs using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and Pawley or Rietveld refinement have been made; however, these methods sometimes encounter limitations. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) has been suggested as an alternative technique for obtaining accurate structural information on COFs. However, harvesting COFs of sufficiently high purity and quality, with crystals of sufficient size for SCXRD analysis, is difficult. Significant research on growing single&#8208;crystalline COFs (SC&#8208;COFs) with large crystals using modulators for reversible bond control has recently enabled SCXRD studies. In this review, we introduce various strategies, including molecular design and synthesis methods, for growing SC&#8208;COFs, and highlight several notable examples that leverage precise structural information for specific applications.

         <title>A Potassium Base&#8208;Promoted Intramolecular Enolate&#8211;Olefin Metathesis</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel olefin metathesis, the enolate&#8208;olefin metathesis reaction, in which two double bonds recombine via a four&#8208;membered carbocyclic intermediate (NOT metallacyclobutane intermediate), is developed. The methodology is a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, base&#8208;promoted enolate&#8211;olefin metathesis involving [2&#160;+&#160;2] / retro&#8208;[2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition sequences of 2&#8208;acyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;alkenylbiaryl substrates. This reaction enables the synthesis of a wide range of hydroxy&#8208;substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.








Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are important structures known for their unique properties. Herein, we present a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free method for synthesizing hydroxy&#8208;substituted PAHs using base&#8208;promoted intramolecular enolate&#8208;olefin&#8208;metathesis chemistry. 2&#8208;Acyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;alkenylbiaryl substrates were subjected to [2&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;/retro&#8208;[2&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;cycloaddition sequences to afford functionalized PAH derivatives, including enantiomerically enriched [7]helicenes. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predicted that ionic and radical intermediates are involved in a stepwise process. Various biaryl substrates, including heteroatom&#8208;containing compounds, were successfully converted into the desired PAHs. The developed method also enabled the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;extended arenols, thereby offering a sustainable and efficient alternative to transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed processes.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;stretchable Transparent Hydrogels with Low Hydrophobic and Amphiphilic Monomers Using Asymmetric Crosslinker to Give Low Mechanical Hysteresis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 55, October 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copolymerizing a low&#8208;hydrophobic monomer and an amphiphilic monomer with an asymmetric crosslinker has led to a transparent, highly stretchable hydrogel. Optimizing the monomer concentration and ratio has led to up to a 19.3 swelling ratio and 1300% stretchability, or over 3000% with slightly reduced transparency, with all hydrogels displaying low hysteresis and rapid contraction.








Abstract
Exploring a reasonable network design to develop highly stretchable hydrogels with over 1,000% extension is still a big challenge in the field of hydrogel chemistry and materials. Micellar copolymerization with hydrophobic monomers and surfactants/proteins is a well&#8208;studied approach to provide stretchable hydrogels with hydrophobic association domains as sacrificial bonds when subjected to large deformation, but some limitations, such as dose increase of such monomers and surfactant&#8208;free synthesis have not yet been well considered. In this study, we demonstrate a simple but powerful approach to produce transparent, ultra&#8208;stretchable hydrogels expressing more than 3,000% elongation by surfactant&#8208;free copolymerization of low hydrophobic monomer and amphiphilic monomer. We believe that this result offers wider availability of low hydrophobic groups in various water&#8208;containing polymer materials, including gels, micelles, etc.

         <title>Automation of Multistep Reaction&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis Using Novel Polystyrene&#8208;Coated Magnetic Particles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 55, October 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel magnetic particles were developed to enable automated high&#8208;throughput multistep synthesis on small&#8208;scale. A covalently linked polystyrene shell efficiently protects the encapsulated magnetic iron core to avoid metal release in commonly used solvents, at elevated temperatures and over a broad pH range, thus providing appropriate magnetic properties allowing full automation of multistep reaction sequences.








Abstract
We have developed novel types of polystyrene&#8208;coated magnetic particles for versatile applications in multistep reaction&#8208;based solid&#8208;phase organic synthesis. These particles feature a protective polymer shell that allows them to function under various reaction conditions while maintaining the beneficial properties of traditional polystyrene beads, such as swelling and shrinking in organic solvents. We applied the particles in diverse multistep syntheses, including and combining amide couplings, nucleophilic aromatic substitutions, and Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura couplings at tens of micromole scale. The ferrimagnetic property of the particles enables their reversible immobilization using an external magnetic field, facilitating efficient reagent change cycles through simple aspiration of the separated supernatant liquid. This immobilization principle was applied to particle conditioning, reactions, washing, deprotection, and linker cleavage, allowing for fully automated parallel syntheses in microtiter plates using an automated liquid&#8208;handling system. This platform has already become routine for hit syntheses from various high&#8208;throughput screening campaigns and will enable the efficient production of a wide variety of new compounds by solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Ongoing developments on magnetic particles, reaction conditions, and automated processing will further extend the application range in medicinal chemistry and beyond.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Photoreactions: A Source for Metal&#8208;Polymer Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 55, October 1, 2025. </description>

Photolysis of a mixture containing a photoinitiator, metal salt, and monomers in an aqueous or alcoholic medium yields nanocomposites. We present a straightforward method for their synthesis and demonstrate their application as heterogeneous catalysts.








Abstract
We have developed a one&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot photo&#8208;induced method for synthesizing metal/polymer nanocomposites. This approach utilizes the photolysis of a bis(acyl)phosphane oxide (BAPO) photoinitiator. Two types of radicals are formed. One initiates a radical polymerization while the other acts as a reducing agent in aqueous or alcoholic media. As a result, metal nanoparticles are formed in situ during polymerization and become embedded within the growing polymer matrix. This simultaneous formation and incorporation lead to the direct immobilization of metal centers, yielding stable nanocomposites. In this proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study, we established mechanistic details and characterized the composites. We have evaluated their activity in well&#8208;established catalytic reactions. Here, Pd composites were used for Suzuki coupling, Cu for alkyne&#8208;azide coupling (CuAAC), and Ag for the reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol. The results confirm that the nanocomposites exhibit catalytic activity. Our methodology offers a versatile and easily tunable platform for the synthesis of nanocomposites. Any monomer amenable to radical polymerization can be employed, and a wide range of metal salts can be reduced via the photo&#8208;initiated process. The syntheses are rapid (approximately 10 minutes), require no hazardous solvents or complex reaction conditions, and enable straightforward work&#8208;up.

&lt;p&gt;Photolysis of a mixture containing a photoinitiator, metal salt, and monomers in an aqueous or alcoholic medium yields nanocomposites. We present a straightforward method for their synthesis and demonstrate their application as heterogeneous catalysts.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have developed a one-step, one-pot photo-induced method for synthesizing metal/polymer nanocomposites. This approach utilizes the photolysis of a bis(acyl)phosphane oxide (BAPO) photoinitiator. Two types of radicals are formed. One initiates a radical polymerization while the other acts as a reducing agent in aqueous or alcoholic media. As a result, metal nanoparticles are formed in situ during polymerization and become embedded within the growing polymer matrix. This simultaneous formation and incorporation lead to the direct immobilization of metal centers, yielding stable nanocomposites. In this proof-of-principle study, we established mechanistic details and characterized the composites. We have evaluated their activity in well-established catalytic reactions. Here, Pd composites were used for Suzuki coupling, Cu for alkyne-azide coupling (CuAAC), and Ag for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol. The results confirm that the nanocomposites exhibit catalytic activity. Our methodology offers a versatile and easily tunable platform for the synthesis of nanocomposites. Any monomer amenable to radical polymerization can be employed, and a wide range of metal salts can be reduced via the photo-initiated process. The syntheses are rapid (approximately 10 minutes), require no hazardous solvents or complex reaction conditions, and enable straightforward work-up.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemical Synthesis and Structural Determination of the Inositol Glycan Head of Plant Sphingolipid GIPC in Brassicaceae</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 55, October 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first experimental identification of the IG head structure of naturally occurring plant GIPCs in Brassicaceae was achieved through the chemical synthesis of three hexose&#8208;type IGs containing d&#8208;glucose, d&#8208;galactose, or d&#8208;mannose as the second monosaccharide linked to d&#8208;glucuronic acid&#8208;&#945;(1&#8594;2)&#8208;myo&#8208;inositol. Comparison with synthetic standards using analytical techniques revealed that natural IG from cabbage contains d&#8208;mannose with an &#945;&#8208;glycosidic linkage as the second monosaccharide.








Abstract
Glycosylinositol phosphoceramides (GIPCs), a major class of plant sphingolipids, are key components of the plasma membrane and play important roles in plants. These molecules consist of a ceramide 1&#8208;phosphate tail attached to an inositol glycan (IG) head, which typically contains an d&#8208;glucuronic acid (GlcA)&#8208;&#945;(1&#8594;2)&#8208;myo&#8208;inositol structure. The second monosaccharide linked to the O&#8208;4 position of the GlcA residue differs depending on plant species and cell tissues. In Arabidopsis, the predominant second monosaccharide has been identified as hexose (Hex) using LC&#8208;MS/MS analysis. However, the stereochemistry and anomeric configuration of the Hex have not yet been determined using spectroscopic techniques. In this study, we chemically synthesized three different Hex&#8208;type IGs in which the GlcA residue binds to d&#8208;glucose, d&#8208;galactose, or d&#8208;mannose (Man) as the second monosaccharide. Using the synthetic standards, we determined the IG head structure of naturally occurring GIPCs&#160;isolated from cabbage by using several analytical methods. We successfully confirmed that Hex as the second monosaccharide linked to the GlcA residue is d&#8208;Man with an &#945;&#8208;glycosidic bond.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Ligand Cooperation of Ir(III) Catalysts Bearing a &#946;&#8208;Protic Pyrazole Chelate in Carboxylative Cyclization of Propargylic Amine with CO2</title>

Proton&#8208;responsive C&#8211;N chelating Cp*Ir complexes derived from 3,5&#8208;diphenylpyrazole catalyze the carboxylative cyclization of propargylic amines with CO2. The cyclic urethane product is smoothly released via protonolysis of the alkenyl&#8208;Ir species with the aid of the &#946;&#8208;protic NH unit on pyrazole. Related nonprotic pyrazole analogs and &#945;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;protic complexes are not catalytically active, but they provide access to catalytic intermediate models.








Abstract
Bifunctional iridium complexes having a &#946;&#8208;protic C&#8211;N chelating pyrazole ligand catalyze the carboxylative cyclization of 1&#8208;methylamino&#8208;2&#8208;butyne under atmospheric CO2. This reaction affords a five&#8208;membered cyclic urethane, along with a six&#8208;membered regioisomer. Alkenyliridium(III) complexes as catalytic intermediate models are formed by stoichiometric reaction of related nonprotic pyrazole complexes with 1&#8208;methylamino&#8208;2&#8208;butyne and CO2 in the presence of Ag2O, although the protic pyrazole analog is too unstable to be detected. In particular, the isolable N&#8208;phenylpyrazole&#8208;ligated alkenyliridium(III) complex with a cyclic urethane framework is characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The &#946;&#8208;protic pyrazole ligand would be capable of accelerating protonolysis of the alkenyl carbon&#8211;iridium bond in the key intermediate, releasing the cyclic urethane product, and being responsible for the catalytic function.

Abstract
Within the synergistic gold&#8208;silicon catalysis concept, we have reported here the efficient and highly &#945;&#8208;stereoselective Au&#8208;Si&#8208;catalyzed alkyne transfer from 1&#8208;trimethylsilylalkynes to glycals, at room temperature and at low loading (0.2&#8211;1 mol%). The synthesized and bench&#8208;stable (F5Ph)3PAuNTf2 complex was found instrumental to achieve such C&#8208;alkynylation reaction, through the in situ generation of both trimethylsilyl triflimide and alkynylgold complex from 1&#8208;trimethylsilylalkynes. This coupling has been deployed routinely on a wide combination of glycal donors and as efficiently with either aryl or alkyl 1&#8208;trimethylsilylalkyne aglycons, functionalized or not. This method could also be applied to the synthesis of a pseudo&#8208;C&#8208;disaccharide.
DFT mechanistic investigations confirmed for the first time that alkynylgold species i) exhibit suitable nucleophilic character, even when they carry highly electrophilic ligands, and ii) that they react as &#8220;classical&#8221; organometallics and not through their possible carbenic form in reaction with oxacarbenium electrophiles.

         <title>Supramolecular Protection of Carboxylic Acids via Hydrogen Bonding: Selectivity, Reversibility, and Design Principles</title>

A supramolecular protecting group (sPG) enables selective esterification of monocarboxylic acids in the presence of dicarboxylic acids. A systems chemistry model was used to identify key parameters that govern selectivity, yielding general design principles for sPGs.








Abstract
A supramolecular protecting group (sPG) was developed that can selectively protect dicarboxylic acids, enabling the preferential esterification of monocarboxylic acids. The high selectivity (selectivity factor s&#160;=&#160;72) was achieved through reversible hydrogen bonding and measured under synthetically relevant conditions. This strategy offers an efficient and dynamic alternative to traditional covalent protecting groups. To deepen understanding and optimize the performance of the supramolecular approach, a systems chemistry model was developed, which was validated by the good agreement with experimental results. The computational model was then used to explore parameter space and define selectivity&#8208;limiting factors. The insights gained from the model guided the optimization of reaction conditions and provided general principles for using supramolecular protecting groups (sPGs). This strategy is expected to have broad implications for the development of new synthetic tools for efficient and selective organic chemical transformations in the selective functionalization of complex molecules.

&lt;p&gt;A supramolecular protecting group (sPG) was developed that can selectively protect dicarboxylic acids, enabling the preferential esterification of monocarboxylic acids. The high selectivity (selectivity factor &lt;i&gt;s&#160;&lt;/i&gt;=&#160;72) was achieved through reversible hydrogen bonding and measured under synthetically relevant conditions. This strategy offers an efficient and dynamic alternative to traditional covalent protecting groups. To deepen understanding and optimize the performance of the supramolecular approach, a systems chemistry model was developed, which was validated by the good agreement with experimental results. The computational model was then used to explore parameter space and define selectivity-limiting factors. The insights gained from the model guided the optimization of reaction conditions and provided general principles for using supramolecular protecting groups (sPGs). This strategy is expected to have broad implications for the development of new synthetic tools for efficient and selective organic chemical transformations in the selective functionalization of complex molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Host Cavities Enhance the Photocatalytic Conversion of &#945;&#8208;Terpinene to Ascaridole Under Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>

BODIPY&#8208;functionalized host molecules are effective visible&#8208;light photosensitizers for the conversion of &#945;&#8208;terpinene to ascaridole in the presence of molecular oxygen, providing up to a 28&#8208;fold increase in the rate of conversion depending on the host employed.








Abstract
BODIPY&#8208;functionalized host molecules have been used as effective visible&#8208;light photosensitizers in the conversion of &#945;&#8208;terpinene to ascaridole in the presence of molecular oxygen. Host&#8208;guest interactions enhance the effective local concentration of the substrate and singlet oxygen generated by the photosensitizing host. This results in up to a 28&#8208;fold increase in the rate of conversion depending on the host employed. A tetramethyl BODIPY analogue, in which guest access to the host cavity is blocked, was also employed to confirm that the cavities do indeed enhance substrate turnover. Whilst the latter photocatalyst is more efficient due to the suppression of nonradiative relaxation pathways associated with rotation of the meso&#8208;phenyl substituent, the rate enhancement induced by host&#8208;guest binding is not present. Combined, this provides insight for the future design of enhanced systems.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Glycybridin B, a Pharmacophore Screened Candidate for Tubulin Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 55, October 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discovery and first total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;glycybridin B via a five&#8208;step route utilizing a key chalcone intermediate. Initially identified through a pharmacophore screening as a potential tubulin binder, this natural product serves as a tool compound to explore structure&#8208;activity relationships related to microtubule targeting and anticancer potential.








Abstract
Microtubule&#8208;targeting agents (MTAs) represent a pivotal class of therapeutic compounds designed to disrupt microtubule dynamics, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in malignant cells. Nevertheless, their off&#8208;target effects on healthy, rapidly dividing cells result in significant neurotoxicity and myelosuppression. Ongoing research aims to enhance their specificity and identify novel active scaffolds to minimize adverse effects and fight drug resistance. Searching for new potential tubulin binders with a pharmacophore screening method, we identified glycybridin B as a promising natural product. Here, we report the first total synthesis of this compound via a five&#8208;step route, involving a key chalcone intermediate, along with its biological evaluation.

         <title>Oxidant&#8208;Free Amidation of Aldehydes Enabled by Electrophotocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 55, October 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrophotocatalytic method for C(sp2)&#8211;N bond formation via radical&#8208;polar crossover (RPC)&#8208;HAT catalysis is presented. The mild operating conditions enable functionalization of a wide range of compounds, with electricity as the sole oxidant.








Abstract
Electrophotocatalysis (EPC) is emerging as a powerful tool in organic synthesis, offering unique redox transformations without the need for sacrificial oxidants or reductants. Building on this activation mode, we have developed an electrophotocatalytic method for the direct amidation of aldehydes, utilizing electricity and protons as oxidants and light to generate chlorine radicals for hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). This sustainable approach is compatible with a wide range of aldehydes and nitrogen&#8208;based nucleophiles, performing efficiently under batch conditions and demonstrating scalability with flow technology. The mild reaction conditions, adequate functional group tolerance, and versatility make this EPC protocol particularly suitable for C&#9472;N bond formation, enabling functionalization of diverse organic compounds and facilitating late&#8208;stage modifications in drug development.

         <title>Alkali Metal Complexes of a Phosphine&#8208;Functionalized Cyclooctatetraene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 55, October 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel phosphine&#8722;functionalized COT ligand and its inverse sandwich alkali metal complexes (Na, K, Rb, and Cs) were synthesized and structurally characterized. The polymeric architectures vary with the metal ion and crystallization solvent, with an eight&#8208;membered ring obtained for Rb in benzene. UV&#8722;Vis and photophysical studies reveal luminescent properties.








Abstract
The distinctive electronic properties and wide range of applications of cyclooctatetraene (COT) sandwich complexes make exploring this class of compounds essential. The new phosphine&#8208;functionalized proligand 1,4&#8722;bis(dimethylsilylmethyl)diphenylphosphinecycloocta&#8722;2,5,7&#8722;triene, {C8H8&#8722;1,4&#8722;(Me2SiCH2PPh2)2}, was synthesized by reaction of K2COT with Me2Si(Cl)CH2PPh2 first. Subsequent deprotonation with various alkali metal bases led to a series of alkali metal complexes [M2{C8H6&#8722;1,4&#8722;(Me2SiCH2PPh2)2}] (M&#160;=&#160;Na, K, Rb, Cs). Notably, the crystallization solvent and the alkali metals significantly influenced the polymeric architecture and led to structural diversity of all complexes. For instance, the two phosphine arms either coordinate both to one metal atom, while the other metal ion is uncoordinated, or, in other structures, each metal atom is equally coordinated by just one phosphine function. Additionally, the coordination behavior of the pendant phosphine groups determines the emissive nature of these complexes. In all cases, polymeric structures are formed, in which intermolecular interactions between the COT ring and a metal atom are observed. Additionally, Rb forms a benzene&#8208;bridged eight&#8208;membered polymeric structure [{Rb2(C8H6&#8722;1,4&#8722;(Me2SiCH2PPh2)2) (C6H6)2}8]&#8734;. Additionally, the lighter alkali metals in [M2{C8H6&#8722;1,4&#8722;(Me2SiCH2PPh2)2}] can be exchanged by the heavier congeners by using the corresponding tert&#8722;butoxides.

This study reports the first Ru&#8208;catalyzed ATH of &#945;&#8208;iminophosphonates, enabling the efficient synthesis of chiral &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates. Both acyclic and cyclic substrates are converted in high yields (up to 97%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to&#160;&gt;99:1), offering a practical alternative to conventional AH for accessing phosphorus&#8208;containing chiral amines.








Abstract
A novel Ru&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) strategy has been developed for the efficient synthesis of valuable chiral &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates from readily available &#945;&#8208;iminophosphonates. This method enables the conversion of both acyclic and cyclic substrates in high yields (up to 97%) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to&#160;&gt;99:1), providing a practical entry to phosphorus&#8208;containing chiral amines. Notably, this is the first reported application of ATH to &#945;&#8208;iminophosphonates, offering a robust and operationally convenient alternative to conventional asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) approaches.

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Polyoxometalate Chemistry</title>

An integrative data&#8208;driven approach leveraging AI, computations, and robotic experimentation enables accelerated discovery of polyoxometalates, bridging synthetic unpredictability and paving the way for rational, predictive, and functional cluster chemistry.








Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are nanoscale, structurally versatile metal&#8211;oxo clusters with emerging applications in sustainability, energy, nanoelectronics, and life science technologies. Owing to their structural complexity, some all&#8208;inorganic POMs are often perceived as serendipitous outcomes from self&#8208;assembly processes, which poses challenges for scalable rational design. From this perspective, we therefore examine how the development of POM informatics and, more generally, data&#8208;driven POM exploration can pave the way for the molecular engineering of new POM&#8208;based materials targeting customized applications. In the process, we highlight recent successes in the digitalization of POM chemistry and outline which advanced technologies are necessary for progress in this promising area of&#160;research.

         <title>Cyclopenta&#8208;Fused Polyaromatic Hydrocarbon (CP&#8208;PAH) Radicals: Synthesis, Characterization, and Quantum Chemical Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extending the &#960; system of a fully conjugated framework composed of alternating five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings led to further rare examples of bench&#8208;stable carbon&#8208;centered hydrocarbon radicals. Spectroscopic analysis allowed extensive characterization, which was further supported by computational methods.








Abstract
Two air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable cyclopenta&#8208;fused polyaromatic hydrocarbon (CP&#8208;PAH) radicals with six six&#8208; and three five&#8208;membered rings alternately fused to nonacycles were obtained by ortho fusion in suitably ortho,ortho&#8217;&#8208;substituted dinaphthylfluorenes and subsequent establishment of the conjugation. The radicals were obtained in five consecutive steps with total yields of 38 and 16%, respectively; key steps are Suzuki couplings and cyclizing SEAr reactions. Mesityl substituents at the five&#8208;membered rings ensure the kinetic stability of the radicals. They were characterized by EPR and UV/Vis spectroscopy. Quantum chemical calculations led to simulated UV/Vis/NIR spectra and disclosed further properties like spin densities, aromaticity, and orbital energies. Both radicals are best described with the unpaired electron centered in the outer five&#8208;membered rings. The respective resonance formulas show the largest number of fully intact benzene rings. A possible triradical character was computed to be small in both compounds. The five&#8208;membered rings, especially the central rings show significant antiaromatic character.

         <title>Glutathione&#8208;Triggered Nitrite Release From Organic Nitrites Enhances Nitric Oxide Bioavailability in Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provides a three&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy for the generation of nitrite under physiological conditions, measurement of glutathione levels, and determination of the relative amounts of nitric oxide derived from endogenous and exogenous sources.








Abstract
The conversion of nitrite (NO2&#8722;) to nitric oxide (NO) represents a key pathway for NO generation under ischemic conditions. Therefore, organic nitro compounds capable of releasing nitrite under physiological environments have attracted considerable attention. Here, we demonstrate that simple 4&#8208;nitro&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide derivatives efficiently and almost quantitatively liberate nitrite upon reaction with biological thiols, particularly glutathione (GSH). These compounds function as NO prodrugs, enhancing NO bioavailability in mammalian cells through intracellular nitrite&#8211;to&#8211;NO conversion. Notably, their selectivity toward GSH and the intrinsic fluorescence of the resulting glutathione adducts enable their use as probes for monitoring intracellular GSH levels. Furthermore, cotreatment of endothelial cells with these naphthalimide derivatives and the NO probe DAF&#8208;FM diacetate provides a valuable strategy to distinguish between endogenously produced NO and NO generated via synthetic nitro compound&#8211;derived nitrite release. Together, these findings highlight 4&#8208;nitro&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimides as a promising platform for both NO delivery and real&#8208;time cellular redox sensing.

         <title>An Improved Cysteine&#8208;Based Labeling Strategy for GPCR Structural Dynamics Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a strategy to achieve high specificity cysteine&#8208;based labeling of GPCRs by employing phenylarsine oxide to reversibly protect extracellular labile disulfides. This method efficiently reduces nonspecific labeling and enables receptor sample preparations with controllable disulfide redox states, facilitating further spectroscopic studies on GPCR structural dynamics.








Abstract
Spectroscopic investigations of the dynamic signaling process of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) often require cysteine&#8208;based labeling. However, the presence of a highly conserved but labile disulfide bond in the receptor extracellular domain could result in strong background signals, hindering the application of spectroscopic methods in studying GPCR dynamics. Herein we report an improved strategy for site&#8208;specific labeling of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors by using phenylarsine oxide (PAO) to reversibly protect the conserved disulfide bond. This method can efficiently reduce background signals while maintaining receptor functionality, enabling both fluorophore and 19F labeling for structural dynamics studies of the M2 muscarinic receptor (M2R) by single&#8208;molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). This improved strategy is anticipated to broaden the applicability of cysteine&#8208;based spectroscopic methods for structural dynamics studies of a wider range of GPCRs facing similar challenges.

         <title>Unraveling an Organic Soluble Precursor&#8208;Based Low&#8208;Temperature Synthetic Strategy to Impurity&#8208;Free Pristine and Transition Metal Doped Lead Apatites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a mild, one&#8208;step, low&#8208;temperature hydrothermal synthesis of lead hydroxyapatite (Pb&#8208;HA) and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;doped Pb&#8208;HA using [Pb(&#956;&#8208;dtbp)2]n as the molecular precursor. This method prevents impurity formation, ensures selectivity, and yields paramagnetic TM&#8208;doped Pb&#8208;HA, offering a more efficient alternative to existing approaches.








Abstract
Doping of hydroxyapatites has garnered considerable interest, as it enables the tuning of the material's intrinsic properties. However, synthesizing hydroxyapatites and their doped variants is highly challenging, as the synthesis demands high temperature and complex, multi&#8208;step reaction conditions. Hence, we propose a soft, one&#8208;step synthetic approach to develop single&#8208;phase lead hydroxyapatite (Pb&#8208;HA), Pb10(PO4)6(OH)2, and transition metal&#8208;doped lead hydroxyapatites (TM&#8208;doped Pb&#8208;HA), Pb10&#8208;xMx(PO4)6(OH)2 (x &#8771; 0.5 to 1.0) (M&#160;=&#160;Cu, Co, or Mn) through a low&#8208;temperature hydrothermal decomposition route under neutral conditions. A newly synthesized 1D lead phosphate polymer [Pb(&#956;&#8208;dtbp)2]n (1) (dtbp&#160;=&#160;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphate) has been used as the metal&#8208;organic precursor for different lead phosphate phases by employing both solvothermal and solid&#8208;state thermal decomposition pathways. Hydrothermal decomposition of 1 in the presence of required stoichiometric amounts of an additional lead precursor, PbO, and transition phosphates/metal oxides (MO) at 140 &#176;C gave phase&#8208;pure Pb&#8208;HA and TM&#8208;doped Pb&#8208;HA. The associated magnetic and electronic property analysis revealed that all the synthesized materials display paramagnetic behavior, and they are wide&#8208;gap n&#8208;type semiconductors. More pertinently, this mild, versatile route offers improved control over the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratio compared to existing methods and can be adapted to introduce other divalent transition metals into hydroxyapatite frameworks.

&lt;p&gt;We report a mild, one-step, low-temperature hydrothermal synthesis of lead hydroxyapatite (&lt;b&gt;Pb-HA&lt;/b&gt;) and transition-metal-doped &lt;b&gt;Pb-HA&lt;/b&gt; using [Pb(&#956;-dtbp)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; as the molecular precursor. This method prevents impurity formation, ensures selectivity, and yields paramagnetic TM-doped &lt;b&gt;Pb-HA&lt;/b&gt;, offering a more efficient alternative to existing approaches.

         <title>Shedding Light on Synthetic Autocatalysis: From Conventional Closed&#8208;Shell Chemistries to Overlooked Open&#8208;Shell Occurrences</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Why add another catalyst when the product itself holds the power to catalyze its own formation? Autocatalysis in synthetic chemistry enhances reaction efficiency and uncovers novel catalytic behavior across both closed&#8208;shell and open&#8208;shell systems, expanding reactivity and enabling innovative design strategies.








Abstract
Autocatalysis is a kinetic phenomenon where a reaction product catalyzes its own formation, often leading to sigmoidal reaction profiles and exponential rate acceleration. This process plays a fundamental role in biological systems, for example, in chemistry of the origins of life. Although synthetic reactions are not as widely reported as the biological studies, autocatalysis offers a unique mechanism and high efficiency to organic synthesis. This review highlights diverse synthetic examples in various autocatalytic mechanistic paradigms, including well&#8208;studied examples such as the Soai reaction. We also explore emerging examples in radical&#8208; and photochemistry&#8208;based systems, emphasizing recent advances in auto&#8208;photocatalysis. By exploring examples from different fields, this review aims to highlight the variety and potential of autocatalytic reactions for synthesis. We aim to encourage further research into autocatalysis as a powerful strategy for improving reaction efficiency, revealing new reaction pathways, and inspiring innovative catalytic methodologies.

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Squaraine&#8208;Based NIR Chromofluorogenic Probe for HClO/ClO&#8722; Detection in Environmental Waters and Live&#8208;Cell Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared (696/725&#160;nm), water&#8208;soluble squaraine dye SO3SQ was presented for the chromofluorogenic detection of HClO/ClO&#8722;. SO3SQ detects HClO/ClO&#8722; in 100% PBS system and exhibits visible colorimetric change, high selectivity, pH&#8208;independence and negligible cytotoxicity. SO3SQ is successfully used to detect HClO/ClO&#8722; in environmental water and enables fluorescence imaging of exogenous/endogenous HClO/ClO&#8722; in live HepG2 cells.








Abstract
Hypochlorous acid/hypochlorite (HClO/ClO&#8722;), as critical biological reactive oxygen species (ROS), plays essential roles in numerous physiological and pathological processes. To enable sensitive detection of HClO/ClO&#8722; in environmental water samples and living cells, a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) water&#8208;soluble squaraine&#8208;based chromofluorogenic probe SO3SQ was developed. SO3SQ exhibits good water solubility, NIR detection wavelength (696&#160;nm/725&#160;nm), high selectivity, rapid response time (within seconds), visible colorimetric response, and minimal cytotoxicity. Furthermore, SO3SQ achieved quantitative HClO/ClO&#8722; detection in environmental water samples and realized real&#8208;time fluorescence imaging of exogenous/endogenous HClO/ClO&#8722; in HepG2 cells. This work provides new ideas for the future design of NIR water&#8208;soluble HClO/ClO&#8722; probes, while expanding the application of squaraine dyes as HClO/ClO&#8722; probes.

         <title>Modular Assembly of Macrocyclic Sulfonamides via Consecutive Cascade Ring Expansion Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods for the efficient synthesis of macrocyclic sulfur(IV) compounds are rare. In this manuscript, a versatile strategy for the synthesis of macrocyclic sulfonamides is described using a modular three&#8208;stage protocol, including two consecutive cascade ring expansion reactions. The utility of this modular approach is showcased via the synthesis of a library of 42 diversely functionalized 13&#8208; and 14&#8208;membered macrocyclic sulfonamides.








Abstract
Sulfur(IV) groups and macrocycles are both important motifs in bioactive molecules of significant current interest in medicinal chemistry, but methods for the efficient synthesis of macrocyclic sulfur(IV) compounds are rare. In this manuscript, a modular, versatile strategy for the synthesis of macrocyclic sulfonamides is described, using consecutive ring expansion reactions. First, linear starting materials are assembled from simple building blocks. This is followed by two distinct cascade ring expansion reaction steps performed in sequence. The utility of this modular approach is showcased via the synthesis of a library of 42 diversely functionalized 13&#8208; and 14&#8208;membered macrocyclic sulfonamides. The use of consecutive ring expansions is key to the success of the protocol, ensuring the products are formed in overall good yields without requiring high&#8208;dilution conditions.

         <title>A [3]Rotaxane Containing {Ti7Ga} Rings Linking CuII: Synthesis, Structure, and Spectroscopic Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extended hybrid inorganic&#8208;organic [2]&#8208; and [3]&#8208;rotaxanes are reported based on heterometallic rings with threads that link CuII complexes; the crystal structures are reported, and the solution behavior is investigated by double electron electron resonance spectroscopy methods.








Abstract
We report the synthesis of extended hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic rotaxanes based on (pyCH2NH2CH2CH2py)[TiIV7GaIIIO8(O2CtBu)16] (1) and (pyCH2NH2CH2py)[TiIV7GaIIIO8(O2CtBu)16] (3) building blocks, containing an anionic macrocycle and doubly pyridyl&#8208;terminated secondary ammonium threads. Reaction of 1 and 3 with [Cu(hfac)2] (hfac&#160;=&#160;1,1,1,5,5,5&#8208;hexafluoroacetylacetonate) gives {[Cu(hfac)2]3[1]2} (2) and {[Cu(hfac)2]2[3]} (4), respectively, which are characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The products are controlled by the differing steric demands imposed by the two arms of the thread. The structure of 2 is an extended [3]rotaxane, with two molecules of 1 binding to a central [Cu(hfac)2] molecule via the longer arm of the thread, and two [Cu(hfac)2] units terminating the structure at the shorter arm. The structure of 4, where both arms of the thread are short, is an extended [2]rotaxane terminated by two molecules of [Cu(hfac)2]. The Cu&#8230;Cu&#8230;Cu fragment in 2 is linear, with the central Cu lying on an inversion center and with a separation between the terminal copper ions of 31.3&#160;&#197;. Double Electron&#8208;Electron Resonance (DEER; also known as PELDOR) spectroscopy proves that the [3]rotaxane structure remains intact in solution, detecting both terminal&#8230;center and terminal&#8230;terminal Cu&#8230;Cu interactions, with orientation&#8208;selective measurements demonstrating that there is a rearrangement of the structure at the terminal positions on dissolution.

Reaction of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; with [Cu(hfac)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (hfac&#160;=&#160;1,1,1,5,5,5-hexafluoroacetylacetonate) gives {[Cu(hfac)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;} (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) and {[Cu(hfac)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;]} (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;), respectively, which are characterized by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. The products are controlled by the differing steric demands imposed by the two arms of the thread. The structure of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; is an extended [3]rotaxane, with two molecules of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; binding to a central [Cu(hfac)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] molecule via the longer arm of the thread, and two [Cu(hfac)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] units terminating the structure at the shorter arm. The structure of &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;, where both arms of the thread are short, is an extended [2]rotaxane terminated by two molecules of [Cu(hfac)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]. The Cu&#8230;Cu&#8230;Cu fragment in &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; is linear, with the central Cu lying on an inversion center and with a separation between the terminal copper ions of 31.3&#160;&#197;. Double Electron-Electron Resonance (DEER; also known as PELDOR) spectroscopy proves that the [3]rotaxane structure remains intact in solution, detecting both terminal&#8230;center and terminal&#8230;terminal Cu&#8230;Cu interactions, with orientation-selective measurements demonstrating that there is a rearrangement of the structure at the terminal positions on dissolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unraveling the Ruthenium(VIII)&#8208;Mediated Oxidation of N&#8208;Hydroxy Pyrrolidines to Cyclic Nitrones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation of N&#8208;hydroxy pyrrolidines to cyclic nitrones with ruthenium tetroxide proceeds via a concerted mechanism with a defined two&#8208;electron transfer direction. In 3&#8208;substituted derivatives, regioselectivity is mainly controlled by the steric hindrance of the substituent. Radical or stepwise pathways are ruled out by calculations.








Abstract
The oxidation of N&#8208;hydroxypyrrolidines to cyclic nitrones represents a valuable transformation in organic synthesis due to the synthetic utility of such nitrones. In this work, we present a detailed computational study of the oxidation of five&#8208;membered N&#8208;hydroxylamines using ruthenium tetroxide. Through density functional theory (DFT) calculations complemented by topological analyses of the electron localization function (ELF), we reveal a concerted yet highly asynchronous two&#8208;electron transfer mechanism. No intermediates as energy minima are identified, but the reaction trajectory lies near the borderline between stepwise and concerted pathways. Our findings indicate that regioselectivity in the oxidation process does not correlate with the electronic nature of the substituent at position 3, but is instead governed by steric hindrance effects that modulate the approach of the ruthenium tetroxide moiety. This steric control provides a rational explanation for the modest regioselectivity observed experimentally. Notably, the computational predictions align closely with experimental product distributions, lending strong support to the proposed mechanistic model.

         <title>Balgacyclamide A: Structural Revision of the First Reported Total Synthesis and Evaluation of Oxazoline Synthesis via &#946;&#8208;Hydroxy Amides Dehydrative Cyclization Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic pathway for balgacyclamide A has been developed over 21 synthetic steps with an overall 5% yield. In this route, the absolute stereochemistry via the dehydrative cyclization is established, which helps to shed insight into errors within a previous groups claim of the total synthesis of balgacyclamide A. An epimer was also constructed to further our route via the dehydrative cyclization.








Abstract
A total synthesis of balgacyclamide A was reported for the first time in 2020, however, after multiple epimerization studies of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy amides dehydrative cyclization to access oxazolines, we proposed a configurational reassignment from the previous synthetic pathway. Balgacyclamide A is a macrocyclic hexapeptide with antiparasitic activity against Plasmodium falciparum and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. Chemically, its core contains six amino acids that undergo heterocyclization to form one thiazole and two oxazoline rings. Two of the six amino acids are L&#8208;threonines that play an important role in their synthetic pathway to achieve oxazolines with the right configuration upon epimerization at the &#946;&#8208;carbon. Thus, we investigated the effect of L&#8208;threonine and L&#8208;allothreonine &#946;&#8208;carbon epimerization via the Burgess reagent, diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST), and (NH4)6Mo7O24&#8226;4H2O catalyst to support previous oxazoline synthetic studies. Furthermore, the first total synthesis of balgacyclamide A and an epimer is reported via multiple synthetic key steps that involve a tandem sulfur incorporation, cyclization, and aromatization of the thiazole, and a late&#8208;stage &#946;&#8208;hydroxy amide Walden inversion to access both oxazolines.

         <dc:description>
A quinonoidal dipyrrolyldiketone boron complex with an orthogonally arranged catechol unit in the dianionic form exhibited diradical properties, as observed from the singlet&#8211;triplet energy gaps (&#916;EST) that were modulated by coexisting countercations. &#916;EST values were controlled by the bridging boron moieties in the dianion diradicals.








Abstract
A quinonoidal dipyrrolyldiketone catecholate&#8208;boron complex, with two pyrrole&#8208;quinonemethide moieties bridged by a six&#8208;membered cross&#8208;conjugated unit, was synthesized to modulate the diradical character of the dianion formed upon deprotonation. The dianionic species exhibited near&#8208;infrared absorption and electron spin resonance (ESR) signals, confirming the diradical properties. Variable&#8208;temperature (VT) ESR spectra suggest the thermal excitation from the ground&#8208;state singlet diradical to the triplet diradical, providing singlet&#8211;triplet energy gaps modulated by coexisting cations and bridging boron moieties.

         <title>Enhanced Ring&#8208;Opening Efficiency of Fluorescence Photochromic Switches Based on Benzo[e]&#8208;Fused Dimethyldihydropyrene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorophore&#8208;BDHP conjugates demonstrate enhanced visible&#8208;light photoswitching through effective energy transfer. These robust molecular switches also operate in polymer thin film, facilitating solid&#8208;matrix photoisomerization. The strategy provides a flexible platform for advanced photonic and optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Fluorophores have a significant impact on the photoswitching efficiency of photochromic systems such as azobenzene, dithienylethene, and spiropyrans by facilitating energy transfer processes that modulate the photoisomerization dynamics. In this study, we investigate the effect of side&#8208;chain functionalization of benzo[e]&#8208;fused dimethyldihydropyrene (BDHP) photochromic system with carefully selected fluorophores, namely anthracene and coumarin, on the ring&#8208;opening photoisomerization efficiency to the corresponding cyclophanediene (BCPD) form. The corresponding phenyl and naphthyl derivatives and the unsubstituted parent BDHP were studied as controls. Comprehensive photophysical analyses, including absorption and emission spectroscopy, along with quantum yield measurements, demonstrate efficient energy transfer from the attached fluorophores to the BDHP core, leading to an enhanced BDHP&#8594;BCPD isomerization process. This energy transfer mechanism significantly enhances the photoisomerization efficiency, resulting in more than a twofold increase in the ring&#8208;opening quantum yield compared to the nonfunctionalized BDHP controls. Additionally, the efficiency of photoisomerization of the coumarin&#8208;substituted derivative was extended in the switching studies in embedded solid polymeric matrices with efficient reversible photoisomerization, photostability over multiple switching cycles, and an all&#8208;optical logic gate. These findings demonstrate a promising strategy to improve the performance of the BDHP photochromic systems and their potential applications in molecular logic devices in thin film.

         <title>Coal&#8208;Derived Carbon Support Regulates Interfacial Water Molecules toward Enhanced Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution on Platinum Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Increasing interfacial free H2O accelerates the alkaline HER, yet simple and effective methods remain scarce. This work shows that carbonyl and carboxyl groups on carbon supports greatly increase the ratio of free H2O via forming local hydrogen bondings. Consequently, a functional support derived from bituminous coal renders Pt with high activity and stability.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;supported platinum (Pt) nanoparticles (NPs) are efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) but suffer from suboptimal kinetics in alkaline media. While restructuring interfacial water molecules offers a promising route to enhance alkaline HER, simple and effective strategies remain scarce. Here, we prepared Pt NPs on different carbon supports with varied compositions of oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups (OFGs) and explored the correlation between the HER activity and the OFG composition. Structural analyses confirm negligible effects of the support on the morphology, size, or electronic states of Pt NPs. However, in situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that OFGs, including carbonyl (C&#160;=&#160;O) and carboxyl (COOH) groups increase the proportion of interfacial free water molecules by reorganizing local hydrogen bonding. Meanwhile, a bituminous coal&#8208;derived carbon (bitu@C), featuring abundant OFGs, was developed as a functional support for Pt NPs. The Pt/bitu@C catalyst achieves a mass activity of 1.33 A mgpt&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 100&#160;mV, significantly outperforming commercial carbon&#8208;supported counterparts, while exhibiting enhanced stability. This work highlights the critical role of OFGs in modulating water structures and provides a practical, coal&#8208;derived platform for engineering interfacial water molecules toward efficient alkaline HER kinetics.

         <title>Photoinduced Electron Transfer (PET) as Key to Accelerate the Cycloreversion Reaction of Arylquadricyclanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is demonstrated that the photoinduced cycloreversion of a methoxynaphthylquadricyclane in the presence of suitable photocatalysts gives quantitatively the corresponding norbornadiene. As this photochromic norbornadiene&#8208;quadricyclane cycle has favorable properties for light energy conversion, this method provides a useful tool for the targeted release of stored energy with high temporal and local control.








Abstract
The development of methods for the utilization of sustainable energy resources is an important scientific challenge. In one approach, the conversion and storage of solar light energy as chemical energy in a photoreaction has been established, namely as molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST). In particular, the norbornadiene&#8208;quadricyclane system offers favorable photochemical and physicochemical properties for this purpose. However, the chemical reaction to release the stored energy, i.e., the cycloreversion of the quadricyclane, still requires improvement. In this context, we demonstrate that a fast and controlled cycloreversion of 2&#8208;(5&#8208;(1&#8208;methoxynaphthyl))quadricyclane can be accomplished in a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) reaction. Specifically, we identified 9&#8208;mesityl&#8208;10&#8208;methylacridinium, 9,10&#8208;dicyanoanthracene, and 9&#8208;nitrobenzo[b]quinolizinium as suitable catalysts that initiate the fast cycloreversion of the quadricyclane to the norbornadiene with visible light (420&#160;nm) and with low catalyst loading. At the same time, there is no significant loss of favorable MOST properties, namely half&#8208;life and energy storage density. Thus, this method provides an efficient, complementary tool for the targeted cycloreversion of quadricyclane with high temporal and local control, as required for MOST applications.

         <title>Dipolar Molecular Motor Candidates with Planar Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two prototypes of molecular motors with simultaneous implementation of planar chirality and a permanent dipole have been designed and synthesized in 7 steps with overall yields of 2.8 to 5.5%.








Abstract
Two molecular motor candidates built around ruthenium(II) centers featuring both planar chirality and a permanent dipole have been synthesized in seven steps. These motors incorporate desymmetrized cyclopentadienyl ligands bearing electron&#8208;donating (4&#8208;methoxyphenyl) and electron&#8208;withdrawing (3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl) groups in 1,2 or 1,3 relative positions, to induce strong dipolar moments and asymmetry helpful for unidirectional rotation. Two dipolar pentaarylcyclopentadienyl ligands were synthesized and coordinated to a Ru(II) trisindazolylborate complex functionalized with thioether moieties for surface anchoring. Structural analysis and DFT calculations revealed that dipole moments increase upon complexation, reaching 5.60 D and 4.58 D for the 1,2&#8208;CpAr5[Ru]Tp and 1,3&#8208;CpAr5[Ru]Tp complexes, respectively. Key synthetic challenges, such as low yields in Knoevenagel condensations and side reactions, were addressed through careful modulation of precursors, reaction conditions and cation selection. This study demonstrates the feasibility of integrating permanent dipoles and chirality into molecular motor design, which could offer an enhanced control over motion under STM&#8208;induced electric fields.

         <title>Versatile Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;H Arylation of Fluoroarenes with 2&#8208;Chloropyridine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct C&#9472;H arylation of fluoroarenes with 2&#8208;chloropyridines is enabled by a simple Pd/SPhos system in isopropyl acetate. The method uses inexpensive reactants and shows broad scope and high yields. DFT computations explain reactivity and selectivity. This practical strategy provides general access to fluorinated heteroarenes relevant across pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials science.








Abstract
Direct C&#9472;H arylation of fluoroarenes with 2&#8208;halopyridines remains underexplored, due to the low reactivity of both partners and the reliance on harsh conditions or toxic solvents. Herein, we report a general and sustainable method for the C&#9472;H arylation of fluoroarenes with 2&#8208;chloropyridines using Pd/SPhos as a simple catalytic system in isopropyl acetate. The protocol employs inexpensive starting materials, shows broad functional group tolerance, and delivers a wide range of 2&#8208;(fluorinated aryl)pyridines in up to 90% yield. Substrate scope studies uncovered key substituent effects on both coupling partners, while Density Functional Theory (DFT)&#8208;supported mechanistic analysis rationalized the observed reactivity and chemoselectivity. This research advances sustainable and practical methodologies for the synthesis of complex fluorinated aromatic compounds with potential applications in materials science, agrochemistry, and medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Enhanced Solid&#8208;State Luminescence of Supramolecular Tessellation Assemblies Through F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer From Counterions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work explores how supramolecular tessellation enhances fluorescence quantum yield and induces redshift. Through self&#8208;assembly, it suppresses intramolecular rotation and vibration (RIR) that reduce nonradiative decay, boosting efficiency and shifting emission.








Abstract
The development of straightforward strategies for constructing supramolecular tessellations with enhanced solid&#8208;state luminescence has attracted growing interest in supramolecular chemistry and luminescent materials. Herein, we report the formation of diverse supramolecular tiling patterns by combining electron&#8208;deficient bipyridinium&#8208;based cationic macrocycles with either naphthalene&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate or naphthalene&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonate counterions directly. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals distinct tessellated superstructures assembled from 3,3&#8242;&#8208;bipyridinium macrocycles, stabilized by a network of electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; stacking, and CH&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions. These assemblies exhibit red&#8208;shifted and enhanced solid&#8208;state fluorescence, attributed to F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the macrocycles and their aromatic counterions. Crystallographic and computational studies provide molecular&#8208;level insights into the noncovalent forces governing both the assembly process and luminescence enhancement. This work establishes a facile design strategy for constructing luminescent supramolecular tessellations and offers a deeper understanding of their structure&#8211;property relationships.

         <title>Hole&#8208;Selective Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers Overlaid on NiOx or PEDOT:PSS for Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells &#8211; An Overview of Recent Characterization Methods</title>

         <dc:description>
Successfully applying self&#8208;assembled monolayers with hole&#8208;selectivity for lead&#8208;free tin perovskite solar cells requires judicious investigation with appropriately powerful characterization methods, in addition to efforts in the development of new materials and processing. We herein review the diverse characterization methods, the results obtained through them, and how to interpret those results.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) with high hole&#8208;selectivity have seen growing use in the research realm of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Even though SAMs can be used solely, their hole&#8208;selective performance is amplifiable on a p&#8208;type underlayer such as nickel oxide (NiOx) or poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). This is especially prominent in lead&#8208;free tin&#8208;based PSCs. Herein, we review recent relevant publications on hole&#8208;selective SAMs overlaid on NiOx or PEDOT:PSS for tin PSCs. We first examine the characteristic features of the SAMs introduced in each publication. Since SAMs can affect the surface properties, interfacial properties, and perovskite quality, we focus on how these aspects are characterized and which methods are employed. In particular, the employed methods are various spanning computational simulations, microscopy imaging and electrochemical, spectroscopic, and crystallographic measurements. Through this review, we aim to encourage researchers to explore these aspects and methodologies in future research on hole&#8208;selective SAMs for tin PSCs.

         <title>Decoupling Redox Potentials and Excited State Energies in Substituted Chromium(III) Chromophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox and excited state properties of organic and precious metal CT photocatalysts are strongly entangled. In contrast, redox potentials of polypyridine chromium(III) complexes, that feature purely metal&#8208;centered SF states, are selectively tuned by incremental substituent effects of the CF3 group, while excited state energies and lifetimes remain unaffected. Such precisely designed chromophores provide a unique tool for the systematic investigation of elementary reaction steps relevant to photoredox catalytic cycles.








Abstract
Redox and excited state properties of classical organic and precious metal charge&#8208;transfer (CT) photocatalysts can be tuned by substituent effects&#8212;however, not independently, as redox and chromophore units are strongly entangled. In contrast, substituent effects should selectively address electrochemical properties of photoactive complexes based on metal&#8208;centered spin&#8208;flip (SF) excited states lacking CT character without compromising excited state properties. Yet, detailed structure&#8208;activity relationships for SF chromophores are lacking. We demonstrate that the redox potentials of polypyridine chromium(III) complexes, that feature purely metal&#8208;centered SF states, can be selectively tuned by incremental substituent effects, while the excited state energies and lifetimes remain unaffected. This delivers a unique series of chromophores with identical optical properties, but redox potentials tuned by increments. We believe, that such precisely designed chromophore series provide a unique tool for the systematic investigation of photoredox reactions and recombination processes relevant to photoredox catalytic cycles.

         <title>(2&#8208;Phosphinophenyl)aluminum Dichloride Complexes as Intramolecular Al/P Frustrated Lewis Pairs for Ketone, Ester, and Imine Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three 2&#8208;phosphinophenylaluminum dichloride complexes were synthesized and characterized as novel intramolecular FLPs. These FLP systems exhibit high Lewis acidity and effectively activate challenging substrates including aliphatic ketones, imines, and esters. DFT analysis revealed that strain release and Al&#8211;P dynamics govern their reactivity.








Abstract
(2&#8208;Phosphinophenyl)aluminum dichloride complexes were synthesized and their frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) reactivity was investigated. Selective mono&#8208;substitution of AlCl3 with lithioarenes was achieved by introducing sterically demanding substituents&#8212;tert&#8208;butyl, ethyl, or PCy2&#8212;at the 6&#8208;position of the phenylene linker, effectively suppressing over&#8208;substitution and enabling successful isolation of the target complexes. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopic analyses confirmed the formation of a four&#8208;membered P&#8211;Al&#8211;C&#8211;C core structure. These complexes function as Al/P&#8208;based FLPs capable of activating simple carbonyl and imine compounds, including aliphatic ketones, prop&#8208;2&#8208;ynoate esters, and N&#8208;arylimines. The mechanism of carbonyl activation by these Al/P FLPs was elucidated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclobutane&#8208;Containing Tricyclic &#946;&#8208;Lactams Based on a Saturated Scaffold Enabled by Iron&#8208;catalysed [2&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;Cycloaddition</title>

         <dc:description>
First syntheses of pyrrolidine&#8208;, piperidine&#8208;, and azepane tricyclic &#946;&#8208;lactams based on a saturated scaffold are achieved through an Fe&#8208;pyrimidinediimine&#8208;catalysed [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition of allylamines analogues followed by photo&#8208;induced intramolecular C&#9472;H insertion. The cage&#8208;like &#946;&#8208;lactam scaffolds enable strain&#8208;release access to methylphenidate analogues and expand the three&#8208;dimensional chemical space.








Abstract
Highly saturated, three&#8208;dimensional &#946;&#8208;lactams are valuable motifs in medicinal chemistry, yet general routes to cyclobutane&#8208;fused analogues remain scarce. Here we disclose a concise strategy that delivers pyrrolidine&#8208;, piperidine&#8208;, and azepane&#8208;based tricyclic &#946;&#8208;lactams. A pyrimidinediimine&#8208;iron catalyst first constructs the cyclobutane ring and the N&#8208;heterocycle in one step through an intermolecular [2&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;cycloaddition of allyl amines; a subsequent photochemical intramolecular C&#9472;H insertion then forges the &#946;&#8208;lactam. The major products adopt rigid, cage&#8208;like conformations confirmed for the pyrrolidine series by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Comprehensive conformer sampling (using CREST), DFT&#8208;calculated NMR shifts, and DP4 statistical analysis establish the stereochemistry across the library. Strain&#8208;release opening of the &#946;&#8208;lactam ring furnishes methylphenidate analogues in a single step, underscoring the scaffolds&#8217; synthetic versatility. Comparative studies on the corresponding bicyclic systems highlight the unique three&#8208;dimensionality imparted by the additional cyclobutane ring, further expanding the toolbox for lead&#8208;oriented synthesis.

         <title>Stereoselective Syntheses of Cyclic Microsclerodermin Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six different cyclic microsclerodermin derivatives are obtained from l&#8208;xylose and d&#8208;arabinose via stereoselective Sakurai allylations and photochemical Arndt&#8208;Eistert homologations.








Abstract
Starting from l&#8208;xylose and d&#8208;arabinose, six different cyclic microscleroderma derivatives were successfully obtained. Key steps of the syntheses are, on the one hand, Sakurai allylations, whose stereochemical course depends on the Lewis acid used, and on the other hand, photochemical Wolff rearrangements in the presence of complex aminofuranosides. Finally, aromatic side chains were introduced via cross metathesis.

         <title>The N&#8208;Bromo&#8208;Hammick Intermediate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectroscopic and computational analysis uncovers the &#963;2&#963;*0 electronic structure of the N&#8208;bromo&#8208;Hammick intermediate, a singlet N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene isolated in solid neon, whose back&#8208;isomerization to bromopyridine proceeds via a planar transition state.








Abstract
We report the characterization of bromopyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, the N&#8208;bromo&#8208;Hammick intermediate, isolated in solid neon at 4.4&#160;K. Computations (B2PLYP, NEVPT2), IR, and UV/vis spectroscopy characterize this intermediate as a singlet carbene with a vacant &#963;*&#8208;type frontier orbital. This unusual electronic structure (&#963;2&#963;*0) allows the carbene to isomerize to its more stable pyridine tautomer via a planar transition state, avoiding the deviation from planarity seen in other singlet carbenes. The compound's reaction with molecular hydrogen faces a minor but prohibitive barrier (8.4&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1) at the low temperatures of the experiment.

         <title>Hydrogen Bond Reformation in Tetracarboxylic Acid&#8208;Based Organic Frameworks with Square Lattice Topology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural transformation in hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) via bond cleavage and reformation is highlighted. Sql&#8208;type HOFs composed of tetracarboxylic acids bearing 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxy&#8208;o&#8208;terphenyl moieties are shown to be particularly prone to H&#8208;bond reformations. Analysis of molecular conformation and crystal packing provides design insights for controlling H&#8208;bond reformation, guiding the development of dynamic porous materials.








Abstract
The weak and reversible nature of hydrogen bonds endows porous materials with structural flexibility. In this article, we highlight structural transformations involving the cleavage and reformation of hydrogen bonds&#8212;termed H&#8208;bond reformation. To enable control over H&#8208;bond reformation through molecular design, we examine and discuss key structural features. Particular attention is given to tetracarboxylic acids bearing 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxy&#8208;o&#8208;terphenyl moieties as scaffolds for inducing H&#8208;bond reformation. These insights are expected to guide the rational design of dynamic porous materials with tunable properties and stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior.

         <title>Coordination Chemistry of Phosphinidene Stabilized by Mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic Carbene and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Abnormal N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;stabilized phosphinidene, a class of low&#8208;valent phosphorus compounds, has been recently stabilized by an isolated abnormal NHC. However, its coordination chemistry with various metal ions remained unexplored. Herein, we have explored the coordination chemistry of a mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphinidene (mNHP,1), stabilized by an abnormal N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (aNHC) with various metals (Cu, Zn, and Sn) to afford trimetallic, bimetallic, and monometallic complexes, respectively. All these complexes were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. We have also explored the catalytic activity of one of these complexes for alkynylation of trifluoromethyl ketones and found that mNHP (1)&#8208;bound trimetallic Cu&#8208;complex is an excellent catalyst for this reaction with up to 97% isolated yield under low catalyst loading (3 mol%).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NMR evidence shows that tin(IV) chloride complexes with N,N&#8217;&#8208;bidentate sulfur diimide (SDI) ligands exist in a concentration&#8208;dependent equilibrium with acetonitrile, favoring displacement of SDI in dilute solutions. Voltammetry of only the bis&#8208;acetonitrile adduct shows deposition of tin(0) metal upon reduction, which seems to be suppressed in the presence of SDI, suggesting that SDIs may operate as redox&#8208;active ligands.








Abstract
A series of Sn(IV) chloride complexes with sulfur diimide (SDI, R&#8208;NSN&#8208;R) ligands are presented, including structural characterization of first&#8208;in&#8208;class complexes of bidentate diaryl&#8208;SDIs, [SnCl4{&#954;2&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;S(NAr)2}] (Ar&#160;=&#160;4&#8208;X&#8208;C6H4&#8208;), and an oxygen&#8208;coordinated sulfinylamine, [SnCl4{&#954;1&#8208;O&#8208;OSNPh}2]. As part of the comprehensive experimental and DFT computational investigation, 119Sn NMR analysis revealed a dynamic exchange equilibrium in acetonitrile between SDI ligands and solvent, providing insight into their complicated solution&#8208;state chemical and electrochemical behavior. Voltammetric experiments show that, despite this dynamic equilibrium, the SDI ligands appear to suppress typical Sn(IV) reduction pathways. While tentative due to the complex behavior, this suggests that SDIs are functioning as redox&#8208;active (RA) ligands. In conjunction with our previous systematic characterization of diaryl&#8208;SDIs, these findings highlight their potential as an easily derivatized and highly redox&#8208;tunable category of RA ligand and emphatically warrant further investigation.

         <title>Pomegranate&#8211;Like Nano&#8208;Confined Silicon Inside Conductive Carbon Black as Anode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
We report a new strategy to prepare a pomegranate&#8208;like nano&#8208;confined silicon&#8208;carbon composites with excellent performance through a combination of wet chemical reduction methods and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique. The Si/XC@C&#8208;0.2 electrode exhibited a capacity retention rate of 157.7% after 400 cycles at a current density of 1 A g&#8722;1, while the Si/XC@C&#8208;0.5 electrode achieved the highest capacity after 400 cycles, reaching 835&#160;mA h g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Si materials possess a high theoretical specific capacity when used as anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Si/C composites mitigate volume expansion and enhance conductivity, thus achieving improved electrochemical performance in LIBs. Herein, we report a new strategy for preparing pomegranate&#8208;like Si/C nanocomposites based on low&#8208;cost, readily available conductive carbon black (XC) by using a combination of wet chemical reduction and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques. The preparation first involves a facile wet chemical approach to controlled hydrolysis of SiCl4 within XC. Subsequently, the obtained SiO2/XC precursor is reduced to highly crystalline Si particles within XC (Si/XC) using a novel ionic liquid&#8208;magnesium reduction system, avoiding unwanted byproducts associated with conventional high&#8208;temperature magnesium reduction. Finally, a pomegranate&#8208;like Si/XC composite is coated with an outer carbon layer via CVD, forming a nano&#8208;confined Si/C structure. The composites exhibit excellent reversible capacity and good cycle stability in LIBs. At 1 A g&#8722;1 after 400 cycles, the Si/XC@C&#8208;0.5 composite delivered the highest specific capacity of 835&#160;mA h g&#8722;1, exhibiting a capacity retention rate of 121% compared to the first cycle after activation (688&#160;mA h g&#8722;1). This work provides reproducible and scalable means to prepare high&#8208;performance Si/C composites for LIBs.

         <title>Synthesis of Fully Exposed Pt Nanoparticles on a 2D Mesoporous Graphitic Nanocarbon Framework for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a novel 2D mesoporous graphitic nanocarbon framework (MGF) is synthesized through chemical etching of 2D Fe3O4 nanocube superlattices (Fe3O4 NCSLs) and subsequent high&#8208;temperature graphitization. MGF possesses large specific surface area, open porous architecture, and high graphitization degree, making it an excellent platform for constructing Pt&#8208;based ORR electrocatalysts. The resulting Pt@MGF catalyst&#160;exhibits superior ORR activity and durability over commercial Pt/C catalysts.








Abstract
The durability of proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells is often compromised by the corrosion of carbon supports in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) cathodes under harsh operating conditions, including high oxygen concentration, elevated humidity, low pH, and high potentials. To overcome this limitation, we report the synthesis of a 2D mesoporous graphitic nanocarbon framework (MGF) via chemical etching and high&#8208;temperature graphitization. The resulting MGF features a monolayer, highly ordered nanoframe architecture that offers enhanced structural stability and conductivity. Leveraging these structural advantages, we designed fully exposed Pt nanoparticles anchored on the MGF (Pt@MGF) as a model system to investigate the interplay between graphitization degree, pore architecture, and electrocatalytic performance. Among the variants, Pt@MGF&#8208;1200, synthesized at 1200&#160;&#176;C, demonstrates optimized mesopore confinement and strong Pt&#8211;carbon interactions. This results in superior electrochemical durability and ORR activity, positioning Pt@MGF&#8208;1200 as a promising alternative to conventional Pt/C catalysts.

         <title>Products of the Phenyl Radical (C6H5, X2A1) &#8211; Acetylene (C2H2, X1&#931;g+) Reaction in the 800&#8208;1,200&#160;K Temperature Range</title>

         <dc:description>
A pulsed high&#8208;temperature microreactor coupled with VUV PI Re&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS was used to study the C6H5&#160;+&#160;C2H2 reaction via the HACA mechanism. Key products (C4H4, C6H5, C6H5C2H, C10H8, etc.) were detected in a molecular beam. At 800&#8211;1200&#160;K and 100&#8211;600&#160;Torr, the main products were phenylacetylene (C6H5C2H) and naphthalene (C10H8), supporting HACA dominance. Temperature and pressure trends align with theoretical predictions.








Abstract
A pulsed flow high&#8208;temperature microreactor in tandem with vacuum ultraviolet photoionization (VUV PI) reflectron time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry (Re&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS) was employed to determine branching ratios of key product channels of the reaction of the phenyl radical (C6H5) with acetylene (C2H2) highlighting the role of the Hydrogen Abstraction &#8211; C2H2 Addition (HACA) mechanism at temperatures of 800&#8211;1,200&#160;K. Temporal profiles of m/z&#160;=&#160;26 (C2H2+), 30 (NO+), 52 (C4H4+), 77 (C6H5+), 78 (C6H6+), 102 (C6H5C2H+), 103 (C6H5C2H2+), 107 (C6H5NO+), 128 (C10H8+), and 154 (C12H10+) were recorded and characterized within a molecular beam. From the time profiles of the ion signals and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) calculations in the transient mode, zones of the molecular beam corresponding to the open valve duration time were identified. The gas velocity along the microreactor tube axis with the opened valve is strongly influenced by the backing pressure (p) in front of the nozzle and appears to be subsonic for p = 100&#160;Torr and supersonic for p &#8805; 300&#160;Torr. The main quantified finding is that phenylacetylene (C6H5C2H) constitutes the dominant product, accounting for up to 91% of consumed phenyl radicals at 1,200&#160;K, whereas naphthalene (C10H8) formation is favored at lower temperatures and higher pressures, peaking at the yield of 53% (800&#160;K, 300&#160;Torr). The observed temperature and pressure dependence of naphthalene and phenylacetylene yields are consistent with the HACA mechanism.

         <title>Tautomerism&#8208;Coupled Self&#8208;Assembly and Transformations of Iminopyrrole Metallacages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four metallacages with varying size, symmetry, and nuclearity were formed via the self&#8208;assembly of 2,5&#8208;diformylpyrrole, tren, and zinc(II) acetate. Tautomerization of the key diiminopyrrole motif to iminoaminoazafulvene altered the assemblies&#8217; properties. Stimuli&#8208;induced, partially reversible interconversions between bi&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, and dodecanuclear cages revealed their dynamic nature.








Abstract
Four discrete metallacages were obtained from the condensation of 2,5&#8208;diformylpyrrole and tren in the presence of Zn(II). The structures differed in nuclearity, size, and symmetry, with the number of templating cations playing a key role in defining the properties of the architecture. The diiminopyrrole coordination motif, a fundamental structural feature of assemblies, undergoes tautomerization in certain cases, yielding an iminoaminoazafulvene, which alters the assembly. The controlled interconversion between bi&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, and dodecanuclear cages was achieved through simple stimuli, highlighting the dynamic nature of these assemblies.

         <title>Terminal Selective Arylation of Inert Alkanes via Radical&#8208;Organometallic Crossover</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selectivity is an essential part of organic synthesis and key to synthetic efficiency. However, selectivity is challenging to achieve in hydrocarbon molecules. Herein we report a mild and direct method that combines photo&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (photo&#8208;HAT) and nickel&#8208;catalyzed organometallic chainwalking chemistry to give the first highly linear selective arylation reaction starting from inert alkanes.








Abstract
Selectivity is an essential part of organic synthesis and key to synthetic efficiency, where it can help reduce energy requirements for product separation, purification, and disposal of low value by&#8208;products. However, selectivity is challenging to achieve in hydrocarbon molecules, with C&#9472;H functionalization of alkanes almost invariably leading to a complex mixture of products favoring branched isomers and linear selectivity remaining elusive. Herein we report a mild and direct method that combines photo&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (photo&#8208;HAT) and nickel catalyzed organometallic chainwalking chemistry to give the first highly linear selective arylation reaction starting from inert alkanes. Key to success is crossover from a radical to organometallic chainwalking mechanism permitted by a monodentate lutidine ligand, allowing an unselective photo&#8208;HAT step to be funneled regioconvergently to form the linear arylation product for a variety of alkanes. This result is in sharp contrast to the unselective formation of branched products using bidentate ligands and demonstrates monodentate heterocycles to be a privileged ligand class for selective C&#9472;H functionalization. Preliminary mechanistic experiments are consistent with the radical&#8208;organometallic crossover mechanism and support it as an important step toward controllable and selective functionalization of simple hydrocarbons.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Membranes: Emerging Nanofluidic Platforms for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advances in HOF membranes for gas separation. In addition to covering fabrication methods of HOF membranes, this review highlights key characteristics that determine separation performance. Progress in challenging gas separations is deeply discussed, followed by an analysis of current limitations and future research directions for next&#8208;generation membrane development.








Abstract
The development of efficient and sustainable gas separation technologies is crucial for addressing global challenges in energy and the environment. Membrane separation technology, as an innovative, energy&#8208;saving, and highly efficient approach, offers an effective solution to these challenges. High&#8208;performance membranes materials serve as the core component enabling advanced and efficient membrane separation. Notably, hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) represent an emerging class of crystalline porous membrane materials formed through intermolecular hydrogen bonds between organic or metal&#8208;organic building units. The unique advantages of these materials, including moderate synthesis conditions, high crystallinity, and easy repairability and renewability, make them ideal porous membrane materials. This review comprehensively examines recent advances in HOF gas separation membranes. We objectively outline fabrication approaches and material design principle, including development prospects and preparation techniques for HOF separation membranes. We then systematically evaluate the current application status of HOF membranes in gas separation. Finally, future application potentials are projected, and challenges to be addressed in HOF gas separation are discussed.

         <title>Assembly&#8208;Sized&#8208;Controlled Chirality: Increase from Single Molecule to Micrometer Scale Enhances Chiroptical Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We envision a series of chiroptical materials based on highly emissive chiral dye DCS&#8208;Chol in multiple states of solution, powder, aggregate, gel, thin film, and liquid crystal (LC) encapsulation, the |glum| value in LC encapsulation was even amplified 491&#8208;fold, indicating a positive correlation between aggregate/assembly size and chiroptical activity.








Abstract
Achieving a high dissymmetry factor is a major challenge in the field of chiroptical activity. Notably, there is no systematic theory, from the perspective of assembly size, for achieving highly dissymmetric chiroptical materials. Here, we envision a highly emissive fluorophore DCS&#8208;Chol in multiple states, by covalently linking fluorescent dicyanodistyrylbenzene (DCS) with chiral cholesterol (Chol). DCS&#8208;Chol has a superb fluorescence quantum yield (36&#8211;74%) as a solution, powder, aggregate, gel, thin film, and liquid crystal (LC) encapsulation due to the locally excited transition. Interestingly, the successive increase in size of DCS&#8208;Chol aggregates/assemblies from single molecule to LC encapsulated state (105&#160;nm) was accompanied by amplification of circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence, indicating a positive correlation between aggregate/assembly size and chiroptical activity. In this work, a mechanism has been roundly proposed for the occurrence and amplification of chiroptical activity from the perspective of assembly size.

         <title>Recent Advances on the Electrosynthesis of H2O2 Through Two&#8208;Electron Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively overviews the electrochemical synthesis of H2O2 via anodic water oxidation, focusing on recent advances in catalyst design, mechanism studies, device fabrication and applications. Finally, the existing challenges and future perspectives in this emerging field are discussed.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an eco&#8208;friendly oxidant with broad industrial applications, including wastewater treatment and paper bleaching. Despite the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process is the dominant method for H2O2 production, there is a growing interest in direct electrochemical synthesis as a greener production method. Electrochemical synthesis, leveraging renewable energy and abundant resources, offers a promising alternative for on&#8208;site H2O2 production. This review focuses on advancements in the two&#8208;electron water oxidation reaction (2e&#8722; WOR) for H2O2 synthesis, covering the reaction mechanisms, catalyst development, and reactor designs. In particular, this review emphasizes the importance of understanding reaction mechanisms on guiding the electrocatalyst design. At the same time, this review highlights challenges in indirect H2O2 through tuning the electrolyte ions, like the carbonate or bicarbonate electrolytes, and the need for a comprehensive understanding of the electrolyte ion mediation pathways to guide the development of accurate theoretical models for predicting catalyst performance.

         <title>Batch Synthesis of Primaquine Diphosphate Anti&#8208;Malarial Drug</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
According to the WHO, a child under the age of five dies every 2 minutes from malaria in Africa. It is therefore paramount that access and availability of anti&#8208;malarial drugs must be improved. We report a process for the synthesis of Primaquine Diphosphate, where key intermediates were obtained in a much shorter reaction time compared to processes reported in literature.








Abstract
An improved three&#8208;step synthesis route toward Primaquine Diphosphate is reported herein. The anti&#8208;malarial drug was obtained via n&#8208;alkylation of readily available potassium phthalimide, followed by reductive amination and room temperature methylaminolysis&#8208;assisted phthalimido deprotection of the key intermediates to furnish Primaquine Diphosphate in 47% overall isolated yield.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Conducting Amorphous Alumina Electrolytes for Low&#8208;Temperature Ceramic Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton&#8208;conducting amorphous alumina electrolyte derived from &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 and &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 showing disordered atomic configuration with multiple fast&#8208;ion pathways, achieving ionic conductivity of 0.08&#8211;0.12 S/cm at 480&#8211;540&#160;&#176;C for solid oxide fuel cell applications.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance electrolytes enabling rapid ionic transport represents a critical pathway for operational temperature reduction in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). This study introduces amorphous alumina (AlOx) as a novel electrolyte material, systematically investigating its structural characteristics and charge transport mechanisms through comparative analysis with crystalline alumina (&#945;&#8208;Al2O3, &#947;&#8208;Al2O3) and conventional gadolinium&#8208;doped ceria (GDC). It is found that AlOx possesses a notable enrichment of oxygen vacancy concentration. Its unique disordered atomic configuration plays a vital role in facilitating multiple pathways to enable fast ionic transport, resulting in high ionic conductivity of 0.08&#8211;0.12 S/cm at 480&#8211;540&#160;&#176;C, as evidenced by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), which is one order of magnitude superior to its crystalline counterpart. When implemented in symmetrical SOFC configurations, the AlOx electrolyte demonstrates unprecedented power density of 677&#160;mW/cm2 at 540 &#176;C. Further distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analysis confirms the predominance of protonic conduction pathways in AlOx while providing discernment of its electrochemical sub&#8208;processes. This work thus provides a new advanced electrolyte for low&#8208;temperature SOFCs while providing insights into amorphous ceramic.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free PMS Activation by Heterocycle Porous Aromatic Frameworks for Contaminant Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PAF&#8208;146, a porous aromatic framework containing N and S atoms, as a metal&#8208;free catalyst for PMS&#8208;mediated environmental remediation, demonstrates excellent RhB degradation performance through both radical and nonradical pathways.








Abstract
Heteroatoms in heterocycles significantly modify the redox properties of the catalysts, thus exhibiting high efficiency, environmental friendliness, and applicability in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) without metals. Therefore, a porous aromatic framework (PAF&#8208;146) rich in N and S atoms was synthesized from heterocycle building units and exhibited excellent stability. Benefiting from the stability and catalytic activity of PAF&#8208;146, it demonstrated a catalytic performance of degrading 99.7% of Rhodamine B (RhB) within 20&#160;minutes, with a reaction rate constant 95 times higher than that of pristine PAF without N and S atoms. Moreover, PAF&#8208;146 exhibited good resistance to interference from anions, different aquatic environments, and humic acid (HA). The strongly electronegative N and S atoms in PAF&#8208;146 initiated the redistribution of charge density, resulting in positively charged adjacent C atoms. Peroxymonosulfate (PMS) underwent a nucleophilic addition reaction on these C atoms, triggering electron transfer and ultimately leading to the formation of 1O2 and O2&#8226;&#8722;. It was revealed that PAF&#8208;146 achieved efficient degradation of RhB through a combination of radical and nonradical pathways. Our work provides guidance for the development of efficient metal&#8208;free catalysts with abundant catalytic sites for PMS&#8208;activation in environmental remediation.

         <title>Synthesis of the Soft Lewis Superacid Tris(4&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorophenyl)borane B(C6F4Br)3 via C&#8210;Ag to C&#8210;B Transmetalation</title>

         <dc:description>
The soft Lewis acid B(C6F4Br)3 was synthesized via transmetalation from AgC6F4Br, and its Lewis acidity was assessed via DFT calculations and experimental methods, indicating an increased acidity compared to B(C6F5)3. The presence of bromine atoms is expected to facilitate structural analysis of Lewis acid&#8208;base adducts of B(C6F4Br)3 by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction in the future.








Abstract
The Lewis acid tris(4&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorophenyl)borane B(C6F4Br)3 was synthesized via transmetalation from BBr3 and AgC6F4Br. The latter was prepared from 1,4&#8208;C6F4BrSiMe3 with AgF and crystallized as a toluene solvate [2(AgC6F4Br)4&#8226;7.46(toluene)]. The solid&#8208;state structure of free B(C6F4Br)3 and its Lewis base adducts with EtCN, H2O, and POEt3 was determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. DFT calculations show that B(C6F4Br)3 has approximately 1% higher fluoride and hydride ion affinities (FIA and HIA) than tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane B(C6F5)3. Similarly, the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method indicates an increase in Lewis acidity of 2%, whereas IR spectroscopy of the CD3CN adducts reveals a slightly lower &#7805;(CN) vibration for B(C6F4Br)3. The presence of bromine atoms is expected to facilitate structural analysis of Lewis acid&#8208;base adducts of B(C6F4Br)3 by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction in the future.

         <title>Catalyst Design and Mechanistic Insights for Non&#8208;Thermal Plasma Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we systematically explore the enhancement pathways of plasma&#8208;assisted ammonia synthesis and deeply analyze the unique mechanism of action of various catalyst design strategies, such as shielding protection, defect engineering, local electric field enhancement, and antenna/size effect, in the plasma&#8208;assisted ammonia synthesis system. Based on the latest research progress in plasma ammonia synthesis, we comprehensively evaluate the technological routes of emerging plasma ammonia synthesis systems and suggest feasible directions for future research in this field.








Abstract
Hydrogen storage technology based on ammonia carriers is a key part of the transition from fossil fuels to low&#8208;carbon energy sources. However, the high energy consumption and high carbon path dependency of the traditional ammonia industry are the core challenges constraining the development of current technologies. In this review, we focus on the core advantages of low&#8208;temperature plasma chemistry in ammonia synthesis, including mild conditions, environmental friendliness, flexibility, and controllability. We then propose a powerful approach for transitioning traditional ammonia synthesis technology in a sustainable direction. Firstly, we systematically sort out the time evolution of the plasma ammonia synthesis reactor and elucidate the mode of action of plasma&#8208;assisted ammonia synthesis. In particular, we provide an in&#8208;depth analysis of design optimization strategies for plasma catalysts to explore key catalytic mechanisms in ammonia synthesis systems. Finally, we evaluate the performance index of the existing plasma ammonia synthesis system and suggest feasible directions for future research to further improve the energy efficiency of the technology, promoting the development of the ammonia production process in a more sustainable and advanced direction.

         <title>GCI&#8208;Based Affinity Screening of Synthetic Oligomannosides toward Concanavalin A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes the development of a reliable GCI method for the affinity determination of neo&#8208;glycoproteins toward concanavalin A (ConA), a model lectin. The final goal is to investigate multivalent carbohydrate&#8211;lectin interactions.








Abstract
Herein, we report the first application of grating&#8208;coupled interferometry (GCI) to quantify the binding affinity of synthetically defined mannose&#8208;based neo&#8208;glycoproteins to Concanavalin A (ConA), a model lectin for carbohydrate recognition. Mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;saccharides were conjugated to carrier proteins to create multivalent ligands in a structurally defined yet heterogeneous format. Unlike free sugars, which can interact with lectins in multiple orientations, conjugation constrains sugar presentation and provides a more realistic proxy of how glycans are encountered in glycoconjugates. This approach enabled a systematic comparison of sugar epitopes, confirming that Man(&#945;1,2)Man motif shows stronger binding than Man(&#945;1,6), and that the trisaccharide displays the highest affinity. Notably, the multivalent display of these relatively simple sugar motifs resulted in affinities comparable to or higher than those of natural glycoproteins, highlighting the contribution of valency and presentation rather than glycan complexity. Dissociation constants measured by GCI are consistent with literature values obtained by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and other methods, confirming the reliability of this platform. This work establishes GCI as a reliable tool for affinity profiling of glycoconjugates and highlights the value of a simple and reproducible screening strategy for evaluating structure&#8211;affinity relationships of glycans in a presentation format closer to their intended applications.

         <title>Copper(II) Complexes with Schiff Bases Derived from 2&#8208;Pyridinecarbaldehyde N&#8208;Oxide and Amino Acids: Studies on DNA, BSA Binding, Nuclease Activity, and Cytotoxicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of Schiff&#8208;base ligands obtained by a condensation of an N&#8208;oxide aldehyde and amino acids is introduced. Synthesis and structures of their copper(II) complexes with promising biological activities including anticancer properties are described.








Abstract
Synthesis of the first example of metal complexes containing Schiff&#8208;base ligands derived from amino acids and aldehyde with N&#8208;oxide functionality is presented. Five copper(II) complexes with the compositions [Cu(L1)(H2O)(OAc)]&#8901;H2O (1), [Cu3(L2)2Cl4(H2O)2] (2), [Cu4(L2)2Cl6(MeOH)2] (3), [Cu2(L3)Cl3(H2O)] (4), and [Cu3(L3)2Cl3(H2O)3]Cl (5) (where anionic ligands L1 &#8211; L3 are Schiff bases obtained by condensation of 2&#8208;pyridinecarbaldehyde N&#8208;oxide with 2&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (HL1), &#946;&#8208;alanine (HL2), and 3&#8208;aminobutanoic acid (HL3)) were prepared by template synthesis and fully crystallographically characterized. Complexes 1 &#8211; 4 were examined for DNA interactions, competitive studies with EB&#8208;DNA, viscosity measurements, DNA cleavage studies, cytotoxicity studies, interactions with bovine serum albumin (BSA), and theoretical docking studies. The studied complexes bind to the helix through a nonintercalative binding mode; the interaction of complexes with ctDNA is predominantly via intercalation, while viscosity measurements indicate mostly groove binding. DNA cleavage studies revealed the highest cleavage activity for&#160;complex 1. The MTT assay on three human cell lines shows the highest cytotoxic effect for complex 1 against HepG2 (human liver cancer cell line). Experimental interaction of studied complexes with BSA indicates an intermediate binding strength between complexes and albumin, while theoretical docking studies identify possible binding sites of complexes within the BSA.

&lt;p&gt;A new type of Schiff-base ligands obtained by a condensation of an N-oxide aldehyde and amino acids is introduced. Synthesis and structures of their copper(II) complexes with promising biological activities including anticancer properties are described.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthesis of the first example of metal complexes containing Schiff-base ligands derived from amino acids and aldehyde with N-oxide functionality is presented. Five copper(II) complexes with the compositions [Cu(L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)(OAc)]&#8901;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), [Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), [Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(MeOH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), [Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)] (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;), and [Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;) (where anionic ligands L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &#8211; L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; are Schiff bases obtained by condensation of 2-pyridinecarbaldehyde N-oxide with 2-aminoisobutyric acid (HL&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;), &#946;-alanine (HL&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and 3-aminobutanoic acid (HL&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)) were prepared by template synthesis and fully crystallographically characterized. Complexes &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; &#8211; &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; were examined for DNA interactions, competitive studies with EB-DNA, viscosity measurements, DNA cleavage studies, cytotoxicity studies, interactions with bovine serum albumin (BSA), and theoretical docking studies. The studied complexes bind to the helix through a nonintercalative binding mode; the interaction of complexes with ctDNA is predominantly via intercalation, while viscosity measurements indicate mostly groove binding. DNA cleavage studies revealed the highest cleavage activity for&#160;complex &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;. The MTT assay on three human cell lines shows the highest cytotoxic effect for complex &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; against HepG2 (human liver cancer cell line). Experimental interaction of studied complexes with BSA indicates an intermediate binding strength between complexes and albumin, while theoretical docking studies identify possible binding sites of complexes within the BSA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Promoted Acceptor&#8208;less Dehydrogenation of a Germane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chloride abstraction from half&#8208;sandwich ruthenium complexes leads to the generation of stable, but highly reactive, dinitrogen and triflate complexes that can activate Ge&#9472;H bonds. Reaction of the activated ruthenium complexes with GeH2Ph2leads to elimination of dihydrogen and formation of triflate&#8208;stabilized metallogermylenium complexes.








Abstract
The transition metal&#8208;mediated activation of element&#8211;hydrogen bonds is an important goal for the preparation of commodity chemical compounds and novel materials. Here a facile route to the activation of germanium&#8208;hydrogen bonds, based on the spontaneous elimination of dihydrogen, is reported. This represents a mechanistic divergence from the established methods for Ge&#9472;H bond cleavage. The novel complexes [Ru(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)(OTf)(PPh3)2] and [{Ru(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)(dppe)}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)]OTf2 are central to the success of this route. These crystalline species may be prepared in high yield and are highly effective sources of the 16&#8208;electron [Ru(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)(P)2]+ fragment. Both complexes react with GeH2Ph2 to eliminate H2 and afford [Ru(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)(GePh2OTf)(P)2] [(P)2&#160;=&#160;2 PPh3, dppe], which is best described as a triflate&#8208;stabilized metallogermylenium complex. Different species are observed on initial treatment of [Ru(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)(OTf)(PPh3)2] or [{Ru(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)(dppe)}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)]OTf2 with GeH2Ph2. In the dppe case, a &#963;&#8208;germane complex is identified, which is proposed to undergo spontaneous elimination of H2: a key step in the double Ge&#9472;H bond activation, promoted by the sterically demanding half&#8208;sandwich ruthenium complexes. This represents a distinct pathway for Ge&#9472;H bond activation when compared to the established routes, such as deprotonation by a basic hydrocarbyl ligand or oxidative addition, leading the way to new pathways to functionalize organogermanium compounds.

         <title>pH&#8211;Dependent Luminescence of Self&#8211;Assembly Tb3+ Complexes with Photosensitizing Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amphiphilic lanthanide complex with photosensitizer units forms stable self&#8208;assemblies in aqueous ethanol (20&#160;wt.% EtOH). The pyridyl group effectively works as both a photoantenna and a proton acceptor. Self&#8208;assemblies of the Tb3+ complex exhibit pH&#8211;dependent luminescence under weakly basic conditions, rendering it promising for biological applications.








Abstract
Luminescent metal complexes in aqueous solution have been attracting substantial interest as chemical and biological sensors. In this study, aiming to develop lanthanide complexes that exhibit bright luminescence in aqueous media, we designed and synthesized new amphiphilic ligands based on ethylenediamine with two aromatic groups and two cholesteryl groups, which act as photosensitizers and hydrophobic moieties, respectively. In particular, the Tb3+ complex of a pyridyl&#8208;substituted ligand showed an intense green emission that stems from the efficient energy transfer from the excited pyridyl groups to the Tb center in ethanol. In aqueous media, the Tb3+ complexes self&#8208;assembled into nanoparticles with diameters of around 40&#160;nm, which show pH&#8211;dependent luminescence in the pH range of 6.0&#8211;8.5 ascribable to protonation of the coordinated pyridyl groups. These findings demonstrate the potential of aggregates of photosensitized lanthanide complexes as sensors under weakly alkaline conditions.

Tuning unusual energy and eT processes in a bis(acridinium&#8208;Zn(II) porphyrin)&#8208;tetrapyridyl porphyrin host&#8208;guest complex.








Abstract
The 1:1 complex of a bis(acridinium&#8208;Zn(II)porphyrin) host and a tetrapyridyl free&#8208;base porphyrin guest shows a remarkable interplay of energy and electron transfer (eT) processes, finely tuned by the solvent polarity or the selection of the photoexcited component. A more polar environment (CH2Cl2) favors uncommon parallel intramolecular and intermolecular eT processes, while in an apolar solvent (toluene) the intermolecular eT process is hampered. Notably, the apolar environment also enables a rare energy transfer process from the porphyrin guest toward the charge&#8208;transfer emissive state of the tweezer host. In total, no less than four different excited states were probed, which can be sketched by an inverted pyramid diagram highlighting directional path selection.

         <title>Toward Organic Mimics of Metallic Nanoparticles: Tuning and Enhancing Fluorescence in Binary Dye&#8208;Based Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binary Fluorescent Organic Nanoparticles (&#1074;FONs) are made from two optically complementary polar and polarizable dyes (energy donor D and acceptor A). Core&#8208;shell &#1074;FONs exhibit Nano Interfacial Emission Enhancement (NIEE), i.e. an enhanced fluorescence quantum yield and a blueshifted emission, compared to alloy &#1074;FONs of identical composition&#8208;but devoid of core&#8208;shell topology. The NIEE effect is found to increase with the donor&#8208;to&#8208;acceptor ratio.








Abstract
A key characteristic of binary metallic nanoparticles is the extreme tuneability of their optical properties through small changes in their composition and structure. Organic mimics of such binary metallic nanoparticles with similar properties would be of major interest. Here, we present Binary Fluorescent Organic Nanoparticles (hereafter termed &#1074;FONs) made from two structurally similar but optically complementary polar and polarizable dyes (PPDs) (i.e., energy donor D and energy acceptor A) as such potential mimics. We designed dye&#8208;based core&#8208;shell and alloy &#1074;FONs with varying composition (i.e., D versus A content) and investigated their fluorescence properties. In both core&#8208;shell and alloy &#1074;FONs, the donor dyes efficiently harvest energy&#8211;through F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)&#8211;resulting in substantial brightness values (up to 1.3 108 M&#8722;1cm&#8722;1 per nanoparticle). However, &#1074;FONs' luminescence properties were found to strongly depend on their nanostructuration. Core&#8208;shell &#1074;FONs exhibit a Nano Interfacial Emission Enhancement (NIEE) effect, consisting in a blue&#8208;shifted fluorescence and enhanced FRET&#8208;mediated fluorescence quantum yield, compared to alloy &#1074;FONs of identical composition&#8211;but devoid of a core&#8208;shell topology. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time that the extent of this NIEE effect directly depends on &#1074;FONs composition, and increases with the D/A ratio. Furthermore, bioimaging in live cells reveals that &#1074;FONs retain their binary nature and unique fluorescence properties in cellular environments.

&lt;p&gt;Binary Fluorescent Organic Nanoparticles (&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;&#1074;FONs&lt;/span&gt;) are made from two optically complementary polar and polarizable dyes (energy donor D and acceptor A). Core-shell &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;&#1074;FONs&lt;/span&gt; exhibit Nano Interfacial Emission Enhancement (NIEE), i.e. an enhanced fluorescence quantum yield and a blueshifted emission, compared to alloy &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;&#1074;FONs&lt;/span&gt; of identical composition-but devoid of core-shell topology. The NIEE effect is found to increase with the donor-to-acceptor ratio.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key characteristic of binary metallic nanoparticles is the extreme tuneability of their optical properties through small changes in their composition and structure. Organic mimics of such binary metallic nanoparticles with similar properties would be of major interest. Here, we present Binary Fluorescent Organic Nanoparticles (hereafter termed &#1074;FONs) made from two structurally similar but optically complementary &lt;i&gt;polar and polarizable dyes (PPDs)&lt;/i&gt; (i.e., energy donor D and energy acceptor A) as such potential mimics. We designed dye-based core-shell and alloy &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;&#1074;FONs&lt;/span&gt; with varying composition (i.e., D versus A content) and investigated their fluorescence properties. In both core-shell and alloy &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;&#1074;FONs&lt;/span&gt;, the donor dyes efficiently harvest energy&#8211;through F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)&#8211;resulting in substantial brightness values (up to 1.3 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; per nanoparticle). However, &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;&#1074;FONs&lt;/span&gt;' luminescence properties were found to strongly depend on their nanostructuration. Core-shell &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;&#1074;FONs&lt;/span&gt; exhibit a Nano Interfacial Emission Enhancement (NIEE) effect, consisting in a blue-shifted fluorescence and enhanced FRET-mediated fluorescence quantum yield, compared to alloy &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;&#1074;FONs&lt;/span&gt; of identical composition&#8211;but devoid of a core-shell topology. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time that the extent of this NIEE effect directly depends on &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;&#1074;FONs&lt;/span&gt; composition, and increases with the D/A ratio. Furthermore, bioimaging in live cells reveals that &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;&#1074;FONs&lt;/span&gt; retain their binary nature and unique fluorescence properties in cellular environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

An angelic figure holds a dinuclear dinitrosyl iron complex (DNIC) formed from {Fe(NO)2}10 and {Fe(NO)2}&#8313; mononuclear precursors. With its rare &#956;&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;FBF3 bridge and stabilization by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, the complex symbolizes the delicate balance of redox and structural forces in coordination chemistry.








Abstract
Reaction of a {Fe(NO)3}10 trinitrosyl iron complex with a mononuclear {Fe(NO)2}10 dinitrosyl iron complex furnishes a dinuclear dinitrosyl iron complex, [(NO)2(IMes)Fe(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;FBF3)Fe(IMes)(NO)2] (3) (IMes&#160;=&#160;1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals an unprecedented &#956;&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;FBF3&#8722; bridge that links two [Fe(NO)2] motifs, giving an Fe&#8230;.Fe separation of 3.45&#160;&#197;. Nonclassical C&#9472;H&#8230;F contacts (3.21 &#8211; 3.61&#160;&#197;) between the mesityl methyl groups of the IMes and the nonbridging fluorine atom cradle the anion and create a pseudo&#8208;tridentate environment that stabilizes the mixed&#8208;valent core. Infrared spectroscopy exhibits four &#957;(NO) bands at 1778, 1736, 1715, and 1682 cm&#8722;1, inferring the presence of two electronically different {Fe(NO)2} units, whereas 77&#160;K EPR spectroscopy gives a rhombic signal with gavg&#160;=&#160;2.109, diagnostic of an s&#160;=&#160;1/2 species in complex 3.

         <title>Reactivity of Square Planar Pt(II) Complexes Toward Acidic Moieties as H+, M+, and [ML]+ (M&#160;=&#160;Ag, Au)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the fact that Pt(II) in square&#8208;planar complexes exhibits Lewis basic properties toward electrophilic species (E&#8314;), the presence of oxygen atoms acting as competing Lewis basic sites leads to the formation of Pt&#9472;O&#9472;E&#8314;&#9472;O&#9472;Pt or Pt&#9472;O&#9472;E&#8314; type complexes, in which no direct metal&#8211;metal bonds are observed. The formation of analogous species with either H&#8314; or [M&#8211;L]&#8314; fragments can be connected to the concept of isolobality between these electrophilic entities.








Abstract
The Lewis base (LB) properties of the d8 Pt(II) are manifested in the formation of Pt&#8594;E species, where E are electrophiles such as acidic hydrogens or metal cations. Thus, the reactions of [Pt(CNC)(dmso)] (CNC&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;di(phen&#8208;2&#8208;ide)&#8208;pyridine) toward PPh2(C6H4&#8208;o&#8208;COOH) or PPh2(C6H4&#8208;o&#8208;OH) produce complexes [Pt(CNC&#8208;H){PPh2(C6H4&#8208;o&#8208;COO)}] (1) and [Pt(CNC&#8208;H){PPh2(C6H4&#8208;o&#8208;O)}] (2). Their X&#8208;ray structures confirm the proton transfer from the OH at the phosphane to one of the phenylene rings of the CNC ligand. Then, the deprotonated oxygen occupies the vacant site. It is proposed that the transfer starts with a hydrogen bond (Pt&#8594;H) which evolves to the final products favored by the planar nature of the CNC ligand. 1 and 2 react with Ag+ and [M(PPh3)]+ (M&#160;=&#160;Ag, Au) giving rise to complexes without Pt&#9472;M bonds, but O&#9472;M or O&#9472;Ag&#9472;O instead. Their structures reveal that the oxygen atoms present in 1 and 2 advantageously compete with the Pt as the donor entity for the incoming acidic metal. Moreover, dinuclear complexes with O&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O systems structurally analogous to the O&#9472;Ag&#9472;O have been prepared and characterized. They reinforce the idea of resemblance of the proton and cations such as Ag+, Au+, [AgL]+, and [AuL]+ as Lewis acidic moieties, which is consistent with the concept of isolobality.

         <title>Ultrafine Pd Nanoparticles on Triphenylphosphine&#8208;Covalent Organic Framework for Dual Photo/Thermal Catalysis of Scalable C&#8208;C/C&#8208;N Cross&#8208;Couplings</title>

         <dc:description>
This study develops a phosphine&#8208;functionalized COF&#8208;supported ultrafine Pd nanoparticle catalyst (TyPPc&#8208;P@Pd NPs). It enables efficient thermal and photocatalytic C&#8208;C/C&#8208;N cross&#8208;couplings, including with less reactive aryl chlorides, demonstrating high activity, broad applicability, excellent stability, and recyclability for sustainable synthesis.








Abstract
The development of highly active and reusable heterogeneous catalysts for scalable organic synthesis remains a critical challenge. Here, a covalent organic framework (TyPPc&#8208;COF) with aldehyde residues was synthesized and post&#8208;modified with triphenylphosphine ligands to construct TyPPc&#8208;P&#8208;COF. Subsequently, ultrafine Pd nanoparticles (2.73&#160;nm) were uniformly anchored onto TyPPc&#8208;P&#8208;COF via phosphine&#8208;Pd coordination. The resultant TyPPc&#8208;P@Pd NPs exhibit dual&#8208;mode catalytic functionality: In C&#8208;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving aryl iodides, this catalyst demonstrates excellent performance under both thermal catalytic conditions (50&#160;mg catalyst, TOF&#160;=&#160;1060 h&#8722;1) and photocatalytic conditions (30&#160;mg catalyst, TOF&#160;=&#160;1780 h&#8722;1), achieving gram&#8208;scale yields (&gt;80%). Notably, under both photocatalytic and thermal catalytic conditions, this catalyst also efficiently catalyzes Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura, Heck, and Sonogashira C&#8208;C coupling reactions involving aryl bromides and aryl chlorides, which typically exhibit lower activity. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that light irradiation can effectively extend catalytic functionality to C&#8208;N bond formation. Stability tests revealed negligible Pd leaching/aggregation after multiple cycles, confirming structural robustness. This work provides a general strategy for designing COF@MNPs merging high activity, recyclability, and environmental compatibility, advancing sustainable organic synthesis.

Notably, under both photocatalytic and thermal catalytic conditions, this catalyst also efficiently catalyzes Suzuki-Miyaura, Heck, and Sonogashira C-C coupling reactions involving aryl bromides and aryl chlorides, which typically exhibit lower activity. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that light irradiation can effectively extend catalytic functionality to C-N bond formation. Stability tests revealed negligible Pd leaching/aggregation after multiple cycles, confirming structural robustness. This work provides a general strategy for designing COF@MNPs merging high activity, recyclability, and environmental compatibility, advancing sustainable organic synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Carbon Dots as Nano&#8208;Photocatalysts: A Green Tool for Indole and Heteroarenes Alkylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nano&#8208;photocatalytic method for the functionalization of indoles and heteroarenes is reported. The reaction is promoted by the photocatalytic activity of carbon nanodots, which was thoroughly investigated by mechanistic studies to determine the reaction mechanism. The developed procedure allowed for the preparation of alkylated heteroarenes with good yields (up to 88%), with good functional group tolerance, with the possibility to recycle the nanocatalysts up to 5 times without hindering the reaction outcomes.








Abstract
Taking into account the hurdles of climate change and environmental pollution, through the years, the development of sustainable protocols in catalysis stands as a cornerstone to answer those issues. Carbon dots (CDs) have recently proven to be efficient in various types of catalysis, including photocatalytic reactions, while being a green and economic alternative for metal catalysts. In this paper, we present a new catalytic system for the photoredox functionalization of indoles and heteroarenes derivatives based on CDs as nano&#8208;photocatalysts. This reaction, based on the cooperation between our catalyst and 2,6&#8208;lutidine, shows the ability to functionalize these compounds up to 88%, it is effective on 1&#160;mmol scale, and shows a recyclability potential at least to 5 cycles. This system also demonstrated the capacity of obtaining rare types on indoles, having two electron withdrawing groups (EWG), both on the carbon 2 (C2) and carbon 3 (C3). Furthermore, careful studies led to the partial resolution of the mechanism, and to explanations on the regioselectivity of the reaction, which has been studied through the nature of both reagents and substrates, but also through the light's wavelength used in the reaction.

         <title>Oxidant&#8208;Triggered Bioconjugation Chemistry: Expanding the Landscape of Ligandable Lysine Residues in the Proteome</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The development of covalent drugs targeting lysine residues represents a transformative frontier in chemical biology and drug discovery. Despite the abundance of lysine (5.6% of proteomic residues) and its functional versatility, exploration has been hindered by the lack of robust methods to profile its reactivity and ligandability. This work introduces a new oxidant&#8208;triggered bioconjugation platform that enables global mapping of lysine residues, and reveals over 7,000 covalently modifiable sites. By leveraging hydroxamic acid probes activated by soluble and low&#8208;toxicity sodium periodate (NaIO4), this strategy overcomes the limitations of traditional electrophiles and provides insights into the role of lysines in protein function and disease. The platform can be applied to kinase profiling, cancer target discovery, and covalent inhibitor development, offering a potential strategy for addressing &#8220;undruggable&#8221; proteins.
