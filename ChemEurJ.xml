         <title>Targeted Endoperoxides Delivering Singlet Oxygen to Cancer Cell Mitochondria: Exploration of the Therapeutic Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled and targeted generation of singlet oxygen in tumor tissues is poised to evolve into a viable therapeutic approach for cancer which does not require light or oxygen.







Abstract
The clinical practice of photodynamic therapy of cancer (PDT) is mostly limited to superficial types of cancer. The major reason behind this limited applicability is the need for light in the photogeneration of ROS, and in particular singlet oxygen. In order to circumvent this major roadblock, we designed and synthesized naphthalene&#8208;derived endoperoxides with mitochondria targeting triphenylphosphonium moieties. Here, we show that these compounds release singlet oxygen by thermal cycloreversion, and initiate cell death with IC50&lt;10&#8197;&#956;M in cancer cell cultures. The mouse 4T1 breast tumor model study, where the endoperoxide compound was introduced intraperitoneally, also showed highly promising results, with negligible systemic toxicity. Targeted delivery of singlet oxygen to cancer cell mitochondria could be the breakthrough needed to transform Photodynamic Therapy into a broadly applicable methodology for cancer treatment by keeping the central tenet and discarding problematic dependencies on oxygen or external light.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Corannulene Flanked N&#8208;heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) Precursors and Preparation of Their Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the mechanosynthesis of novel corannulene&#8208;flanked imidazolium bromide NHC precursors. The proposed approach is benchmarked against conventional solution&#8208;based methods using green metrics and energy consumption parameters, showcasing ball&#8208;milling as a greener and more energy&#8208;efficient technique. In addition, the new compounds are demonstrated to be robust ligands for transition metals using ligand substitution reactions as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept.







Abstract
The synthesis of new compounds is an important pillar for the advancement of the field of chemistry and adjacent fields. In this regard, over the last decades huge efforts have been made to not only develop new molecular entities but also more efficient sustainable synthetic methodologies due to the increasing concerns over environmental sustainability. In this context, we have developed synthetic routes to novel corannulene flanked imidazolium bromide NHC precursors both in the solid&#8208;state and solution phases. Our work presents a comprehensive comparative study of mechanochemical routes and conventional solution&#8208;based methods. Green metrics and energy consumption comparison were performed for both routes revealing ball&#8208;milling generation of these compounds to be an environmentally greener technique to produce such precursors compared to conventional solvent&#8208;based methods. In addition, we have demonstrated proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of the herein reported corannulene flanked NHCs to be robust ligands for transition metals and their ligand substitution reactions.

         <title>Mesoionic Janus&#8208;Type Dicarbene: Complexes, Adducts, and Catalytic Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal and main group adducts of the first mesoionic Janus&#8208;type N&#8208;heterocyclic dicarbene (diNHC) are thoroughly described in terms of their preparations, characterizations, and electronic properties. In addition, a preliminary catalytic study of its dipalladium complex in the sequential C2&#8208; and C5&#8208;arylation of 1&#8208;methylpyrrole affording non&#8208;symmetrical 2,5&#8208;diarylpyrroles is included.







Abstract
The preparations of homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;bimetallic complexes as well as thiourea and selenourea derivatives of a mesoionic Janus&#8208;type N&#8208;heterocyclic dicarbene (diNHC) are reported. Analogues of its monocationic intermediate NHC have also been obtained for comparison. Using the main group adducts, the &#960;&#8208;acceptor properties of both NHCs were determined using low temperature 77Se NMR spectroscopy completing their stereoelectronic profiling. Moreover, catalytic investigations reveal that the mesoionic dipalladium Janus&#8208;diNHC complex can be used in the sequential C2&#8208; and C5&#8208;arylation of 1&#8208;methylpyrrole for the preparation of non&#8208;symmetrical 2,5&#8208;diarylpyrroles.

         <title>Wittig Reaction in Deep Eutectic Solvents: Expanding the DES Toolbox in Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wittig reaction was performed in Deep Eutectic Solvents with high yields, wide scope, facile TPPO (triphenyl phosphine oxide) removal and scalability of the process.







Abstract
Wittig reaction between substituted phosphonium salts and (hetero)aromatic and alkyl carbonyl compounds in Deep Eutectic Solvents has been developed under a scalable and friendly protocol. Highly efficient reactions were successfully run with a wide range of bases including organic (DBU, LiTMP, t&#8208;BuOK) and inorganic (NaOH, K2CO3) ones in ChCl/Gly 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 (mol/mol) as solvent under mild conditions, at room temperature and under air. The proposed protocol was applied to a wide range of substrates, including (hetero)aromatic aldehydes with substituents as halogens (I, Br, Cl), EDG (alkoxy, methyl), EWG (NO2, CF3) or reactive groups as CN, esters, and ketones. Vinylic, alkynyl and cycloalkyl, alicyclic and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes can also be used. Highly electrophilic ketones gave good yields. The diastereoselectivity of the reaction is in complete agreement with the E/Z ratio predictable under traditional conditions. We demonstrated that the protocol is scalable to 2&#8197;g (5&#8197;mmol) of phosphonium salt, furthermore the proposed workup protocol allows to remove TPPO without need of additional chromatographic purification.

         <title>Monomeric Fe(III)&#8208;Hydroxo and Fe(III)&#8208;Aqua Complexes Display Oxidative Asynchronous Hydrogen Atom Abstraction Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents the lipoxygenase&#8208;like activity of monomeric [FeIII(L5R)(OH)]1+ and [FeIII(L5R)(OH2)]2+ complexes (R=OMe, H, Cl, NO2), employing linoleic acid as a substrate. The rate&#8208;limiting step involves hydrogen atom transfer from linoleic acid to the &#8220;FeIII&#8722;OH&#8220;/&#8221;FeIII&#8722;OH2&#8220; complexes via an oxidative asynchronous concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer (CPET) pathway. The higher degree of asynchronicity in CPET within aqua complexes enhances the rate by approximately five&#8208;fold compared to hydroxo analogs.







Abstract
This paper presents the synthesis and characterization of a series of novel monomeric aqua&#8208;ligated iron(III) complexes, [FeIII(L5R)(OH2)]2+ (R=OMe, H, Cl, NO2), supported by an amide&#8208;containing pentadentate N5 donor ligand, L5R [HL5R=2&#8208;(((1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methyl)(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;methyl)amino)&#8208;N&#8208;(5&#8208;R&#8208;quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)acetamide]. The complexes were characterized by various spectroscopic and analytical techniques, including electrochemistry and magnetic measurements. The Fe(III)&#8208;hydroxo complexes, [FeIII(L5R)(OH)]1+, were generated in&#8197;situ by deprotonating the corresponding aqua complexes in a pH ~7 aqueous medium. In another way, adding one equivalent of a base to a methanolic solution of the Fe(III)&#8208;aqua complexes also produced the Fe(III)&#8208;hydroxo complexes. The study uses linoleic fatty acid as a substrate to explore the hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) reactivity of both hydroxo and aqua complexes. The investigation highlights the substitution effect of the L5R ligand on reactivity, revealing a higher rate when an electron&#8208;withdrawing group is present. Hammett analyses and(or) determination of the asynchronicity factor (&#951;) suggest an oxidative asynchronous concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer (CPET) pathway for the HAA reactions. Aqua complexes exhibited a higher asynchronicity in CPET, resulting in higher reaction rates than their hydroxo analogs. Overall, the work provides insights into the beneficial role of a higher imbalance in electron&#8208;transfer&#8208;proton&#8208;transfer (ET&#8208;PT) contributions in HAA reactivity.

&lt;p&gt;This paper presents the lipoxygenase-like activity of monomeric [Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(L&lt;sup&gt;5R&lt;/sup&gt;)(OH)]&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt; and [Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(L&lt;sup&gt;5R&lt;/sup&gt;)(OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; complexes (R=OMe, H, Cl, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), employing linoleic acid as a substrate. The rate-limiting step involves hydrogen atom transfer from linoleic acid to the &#8220;Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;OH&#8220;/&#8221;Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8220; complexes &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; an oxidative asynchronous concerted proton-electron transfer (CPET) pathway. The higher degree of asynchronicity in CPET within aqua complexes enhances the rate by approximately five-fold compared to hydroxo analogs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper presents the synthesis and characterization of a series of novel monomeric aqua-ligated iron(III) complexes, [Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(L&lt;sup&gt;5R&lt;/sup&gt;)(OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (R=OMe, H, Cl, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), supported by an amide-containing pentadentate N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; donor ligand, L&lt;sup&gt;5R&lt;/sup&gt; [HL&lt;sup&gt;5R&lt;/sup&gt;=2-(((1-methyl-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-imidazol-2-yl)methyl)(pyridin-2-yl-methyl)amino)-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(5-&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-quinolin-8-yl)acetamide]. The complexes were characterized by various spectroscopic and analytical techniques, including electrochemistry and magnetic measurements. The Fe(III)-hydroxo complexes, [Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(L&lt;sup&gt;5R&lt;/sup&gt;)(OH)]&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt;, were generated &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; by deprotonating the corresponding aqua complexes in a pH ~7 aqueous medium. In another way, adding one equivalent of a base to a methanolic solution of the Fe(III)-aqua complexes also produced the Fe(III)-hydroxo complexes. The study uses linoleic fatty acid as a substrate to explore the hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) reactivity of both hydroxo and aqua complexes. The investigation highlights the substitution effect of the L&lt;sup&gt;5R&lt;/sup&gt; ligand on reactivity, revealing a higher rate when an electron-withdrawing group is present. Hammett analyses and(or) determination of the asynchronicity factor (&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;) suggest an oxidative asynchronous concerted proton-electron transfer (CPET) pathway for the HAA reactions. Aqua complexes exhibited a higher asynchronicity in CPET, resulting in higher reaction rates than their hydroxo analogs. Overall, the work provides insights into the beneficial role of a higher imbalance in electron-transfer-proton-transfer (ET-PT) contributions in HAA reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based Ion&#8208;Pair Recognition for Encapsulation of a Stilbazolium&#8208;Type Dye with Enhanced Photophysical Properties and Nonlinear Optical Activity</title>

         <dc:description>
A pillar[5]arene is used as an ion&#8208;pair receptor for the modulation of both the crystalline&#8208;state packing and photophysical properties of a dye guest. The host&#8722;guest complex cocrystals formed from this pillar[5]arene receptor and the dye guest not only show enhanced solid&#8208;state photoluminescence quantum yields compared to dye crystals, but also possess second harmonic generation activity.







Abstract
Constructing organic composite materials through molecular recognition has emerged as an important theme in materials science. Here we report an ion&#8208;pair recognition system involving the use of a propoxylated pillar[5]arene (PrP5) to modulate the solid&#8208;state photophysical properties of dye trans&#8208;4&#8217;&#8208;(dimethylamino)&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;stilbazolium hexafluorophosphate (DMASP). Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveals that the dye guest DMASP is encapsulated by PrP5 to form a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8722;guest complex 2PrP5&#11815;DMASP in the crystalline state. The macrocyclic skeleton of PrP5 imposes restrictions on the intramolecular motions of the dye guest, leading to a significant enhancement of its fluorescence emission. Additionally, within the 2PrP5&#11815;DMASP complex crystal structure, DMASP molecules are found to display two possible opposite orientations in the one&#8208;dimensional channels formed by PrP5 molecules. This arrangement is believed to alter the overall solid&#8208;state packing structure of DMASP, thereby activating its nonlinear optical activity. This work not only reports a novel ion&#8208;pair molecular recognition system based on pillararenes but also provides valuable insights into the modulation of the crystalline state photophysical properties of organic dyes via cocrystal engineering.

         <title>The Influence of Disulfide, Thioacetal and Lanthionine&#8208;Bridges on the Conformation of a Macrocyclic Peptide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Does the bridge matter? We have compared the solution conformations of lanthionine, disulfide and thioacetal&#8208;bridged cyclic analogues of angiotensin(1&#8211;7). Despite the different bridging structures, the major conformations are found to be conserved for the macrocyclic core.







Abstract
Cyclisation of peptides by forming thioether (lanthionine), disulfide (cystine) or methylene thioacetal bridges between side chains is established as an important tool to stabilise a given structure, enhance metabolic stability and optimise both potency and selectivity. However, a systematic comparative study of the effects of differing bridging modalities on peptide conformation has not previously been carried out. In this paper, we have used the NMR deconvolution algorithm, NAMFIS, to determine the conformational ensembles, in aqueous solution, of three cyclic analogues of angiotensin(1&#8211;7), incorporating either disulfide, or non&#8208;reducible thioether or methylene thioacetal bridges. We demonstrate that the major solution conformations are conserved between the different bridged peptides, but the distribution of conformations differs appreciably. This suggests that subtle differences in ring size and bridging structure can be exploited to fine&#8208;tune the conformational properties of cyclic peptides, which may modulate their bioactivities.

Abstract
Complex oxides Eu2MeO6 (Me&#8211;Mo, W), Eu2W2O9 were obtained by a solid&#8208;phase reaction between binary oxides. The thermodynamic and kinetic mechanisms of the reaction processes were established using a variety of physical&#8208;chemical methods. All compounds obtained in this work crystallize in the low&#8208;symmetry monoclinic system, forming complex framework structures, which determine a set of very valuable physical&#8208;chemical properties. Comparison of experimental Kubelka&#8208;Munk functions and DFT&#8208; calculated absorption spectra shows adequate agreement and reveals the origin of the fundamental absorption. In addition, the deficiency in DFT calculations in the part of mutual contribution of CTBs of Mo&#8722;O and W&#8722;O, from one side, and Eu&#8722;O contributions, from the other side, is reported. Calculations of absorption spectra are shown to be superior to band structure analysis in the determination of optical band gaps. Additionally, luminescent properties of Eu2MeO6 and Eu2W2O9 compounds were investigated. These studies provide a better understanding of the electronic and optical properties of the compounds Eu2MeO6 and Eu2W2O9, along with their potential applications in various areas.

Abstract
We described a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed atom economic and selective hydroamination&#8208;cyclization of alkynyl&#8208;tethered quinazolinones to prepare a variety of indole&#8208;fused pyrazino[1,2&#8208;a]quinazolinones in good to excellent yields ranging from 39&#8201;%&#8211;99&#8201;% under mild reaction conditions. Control experiments revealed that coordination&#8208;directed method of quinazolinone moiety with copper(I) was important for the selective hydroamination&#8208;cyclization of alkynes at the N1&#8208;atom instead of N3&#8208;atom of quinazolinone. The reaction could be easily performed at gram scales and some prepared indole&#8208;fused pyrazino[1,2&#8208;a]quinazolinones with donating groups on the indole moiety showed a distinct fluorescence emission wavelength with blue shift under the acid conditions.

&lt;p&gt;We described a copper(I)-catalyzed atom economic and selective hydroamination-cyclization of alkynyl-tethered quinazolinones to prepare a variety of indole-fused pyrazino[1,2-a]quinazolinones in good to excellent yields ranging from 39&#8201;%&#8211;99&#8201;% under mild reaction conditions. Control experiments revealed that coordination-directed method of quinazolinone moiety with copper(I) was important for the selective hydroamination-cyclization of alkynes at the N1-atom instead of N3-atom of quinazolinone. The reaction could be easily performed at gram scales and some prepared indole-fused pyrazino[1,2-a]quinazolinones with donating groups on the indole moiety showed a distinct fluorescence emission wavelength with blue shift under the acid conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Dynamics in Segregated Donor&#8208;Acceptor Stacks Versus a Peri&#8208;Bisdonor&#8208;Acceptor System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Delocalized excitation in the segregated stacks of the naphthalenemonoimide&#8208;perylene based donor&#8208;acceptor system (NI&#8208;Pe) is reported. In the monomer of the fork&#8208;shaped bisdonor&#8208;acceptor system (NI&#8208;Pe2) with intrinsic close&#8208;stacked perylene donors, a long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated (CS) state is observed in non&#8208;polar solvents. The CS state involves a delocalized perylene dimer radical cation engendered by the peri&#8208;perylene interactions in NI&#8208;Pe2.







Abstract
The investigation of impact of through&#8208;space/through&#8208;bond electronic interaction among chromophores on photoexcited&#8208;state properties has immense potential owing to the distinct emergent photophysical pathways. Herein, the photoexcited&#8208;state dynamics of homo&#8208;sorted &#960;&#8208;stacked aggregates of a naphthalenemonoimide and perylene&#8208;based acceptor&#8208;donor (NI&#8208;Pe) system and a fork&#8208;shaped acceptor&#8208;bisdonor (NI&#8208;Pe2) system possessing integrally stacked peri&#8208;substituted donors was examined. Femtosecond transient absorption (fsTA) spectra of NI&#8208;Pe monomer recorded in chloroform displayed spectroscopic signatures of the singlet state of Pe; 1Pe*, the charge&#8208;separated state; NI&#8722;&#8901;&#8208;Pe+&#8901;, and the triplet state of Pe; 3Pe*. The examination of ultrafast excited&#8208;state processes of NI&#8208;Pe aggregate in chloroform revealed faster charge recombination (

         <title>Photoinduced Transition&#8208;Metal and External Photosensitizer Free Benzylic Fluorination of Unactivated Alkylarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalytic monofluorination of unactivated alkylarenes, potentially initiated via a single&#8208;electron transfer, offers a highly efficient and selective pathway with excellent substrate compatibility, enabling the scale&#8208;up synthesis of pharmaceutical molecules. Omitting transition&#8208;metal catalysts and photosensitizers simplifies late&#8208;stage drug modification and the purification process.







Abstract
A green and efficient protocol for the direct monofluorination of unactivated alkylarenes under visible&#8208;light irradiation has been developed, without any extraneous transition&#8208;metal catalysts or photosensitizers. This method is compatible with a broad spectrum of functional groups, including carboxylic and alcoholic scaffolds, under mild reaction conditions. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis of a fluorine&#8208;containing pharmaceutical analogue was successfully executed, underscoring the strategy's reliability and practicality. Furthermore, mechanistic studies suggest that a single&#8208;electron transfer mechanism might be responsible for the generation of the benzylic radicals in initiation step.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Catalytic Metal&#8208;Based Homogeneous&#8208;Heterogeneous Systems in Organic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this concept article we provide examples where metal&#8208;based homogeneous and heterogeneous multi&#8208;catalytic systems cooperate to provide advantages over conventional catalytic systems, such as higher compatibility or increased sustainability. This simple, yet powerful strategy has an untapped potential to address important challenges in organic chemistry.







Abstract
The combination of metal&#8208;based homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts in the same reaction media is a powerful, yet relatively unexplored approach in organic chemistry. This strategy can address important limitations associated with purely homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysis such as the incompatibility of different catalytic species in solution, or the limited tunability of solid catalysts, respectively. Moreover, the facile reusability of the solid catalyst, contributes to increase the overall sustainability of the process. As a result, this semi&#8208;heterogeneous multi&#8208;catalytic approach has unlocked significant advances in organic chemistry, improving existing reactions and even enabling the discovery of novel transformations, exemplified by the formal alkane metathesis. This concept article aims to showcase the benefits of this strategy through the exploration of diverse relevant examples from the literature, hoping to spur research on new metal&#8208;based homogeneous&#8208;heterogeneous catalyst combinations that will result in reactivity challenging to achieve by conventional homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysis alone.

         <title>Exploring the Esterase Catalytic Activity of Minimalist Heptapeptide Amyloid Fibers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The esterase activity of minimalist amyloid fibers, made up of seven&#8208;residue peptides IHIHIHI and IHIHIQI, is examined using computational techniques. Contrary to initial assumptions, computational simulations reveal that the twist angle of the fiber is not notably influenced by the sixth residue, the reduction in the energy barrier when Gln is present being attributed to the formation of hydrogen bonds with the substrate.







Abstract
This paper investigates the esterase activity of minimalist amyloid fibers composed of short seven&#8208;residue peptides, IHIHIHI (IH7) and IHIHIQI (IH7Q), with a particular focus on the role of the sixth residue position within the peptide sequence. Through computational simulations and analyses, we explore the molecular mechanisms underlying catalysis in these amyloid&#8208;based enzymes. Contrary to initial hypotheses, our study reveals that the twist angle of the fiber, and thus the catalytic site's environment, is not notably affected by the sixth residue. Instead, the sixth residue interacts with the p&#8208;nitrophenylacetate (pNPA) substrate, particularly through its &#8722;NO2 group, potentially enhancing catalysis. Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations of the reaction mechanism suggest that the polarizing effect of glutamine enhances catalytic activity by forming a stabilizing network of hydrogen bonds with pNPA, leading to lower energy barriers and a more exergonic reaction. Our findings provide valuable insights into the intricate interplay between peptide sequence, structural arrangement, and catalytic function in amyloid&#8208;based enzymes, offering potentially valuable information for the design and optimization of biomimetic catalysts.

         <title>A Hydrogen Bonded Non&#8208;Porous Organic&#8208;Inorganic Framework for Measuring Cysteine in Blood Plasma and Endogenous Cancer Cell</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reports the synthesis of a non&#8208;luminescent one&#8208;dimensional hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic&#8208;inorganic framework (HOIF) of Cu(II) and its affinity studies with cysteine. Cysteine measurement by HOIF has been validated using a commercial dye, &#8220;Cysteine Green&#8221;. The probe is suitable for measuring cysteine in plasma and bio&#8208;imaging endogenous cysteine in cancer cells.







Abstract
An imbalance in cysteine (Cys) levels in the cells and plasma has been identified as the risk indicator for various human diseases. The structural similarity of cysteine with its congener homocysteine and glutathione offers challenges in its measurement. Herein, we report a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic&#8208;inorganic framework of Cu(II) (HOIF) for the selective detection of cysteine over other biothiols. The non&#8208;fluorescent HOIF showed 12&#8208;fold green emission in the presence of cysteine.

&lt;p&gt;This article reports the synthesis of a non-luminescent one-dimensional hydrogen-bonded organic-inorganic framework (HOIF) of Cu(II) and its affinity studies with cysteine. Cysteine measurement by HOIF has been validated using a commercial dye, &#8220;Cysteine Green&#8221;. The probe is suitable for measuring cysteine in plasma and bio-imaging endogenous cysteine in cancer cells.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An imbalance in cysteine (Cys) levels in the cells and plasma has been identified as the risk indicator for various human diseases. The structural similarity of cysteine with its congener homocysteine and glutathione offers challenges in its measurement. Herein, we report a hydrogen-bonded organic-inorganic framework of Cu(II) (HOIF) for the selective detection of cysteine over other biothiols. The non-fluorescent HOIF showed 12-fold green emission in the presence of cysteine. The monomeric unit of HOIF is stabilized via intermolecular hydrogen bonds, resulting in a non-porous network structure. Non-interference from homocysteine, glutathione, and other competitive bio-analytes revealed explicit affinity of HOIF for cysteine. Fluorimetric titration showed a wide working concentration window (650&#8197;nM&#8211;800&#8197;&#956;M) for measuring cysteine in an aqueous medium. The mechanistic investigation involving HRMS, EPR, and UV-vis spectroscopic studies revealed the decomplexation of HOIF with Cys, resulting in a fluorescence turn-on response from the luminescent ligand. Validation using a commercial dye, &#8220;Cysteine Green&#8221;, confirmed the prospect of HOIF for early diagnostic purposes. Utilizing the fluorescence turn-on property of HOIF in the presence of cysteine, we measured cysteine quantitatively in the blood plasma samples. Bio-imaging of endogenous cysteine in cancer cells indicated the ability of HOIF to monitor the intracellular cysteine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reproducible Green Syntheses Using Hybrid Sol&#8208;Gel Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aiming to contribute to eradicate a certain naivet&#233; common to many research chemists specializing in green chemistry and catalysis, this study illustrates through selected examples of reproducible green syntheses using hybrid sol&#8208;gel catalysts from doctoral theses and research articles published between 2013 and early 2024, how said catalysts have been applied to a number industrially relevant green synthetic methods.







Abstract
Referring to selected examples of reproducible green syntheses using hybrid sol&#8208;gel catalysts of the SiliaCat series from different doctoral theses and research works published between 2015 and early 2024, this study briefly illustrates how said catalysts have been applied in a number of green synthetic methods of significant industrial relevance. This shows evidence that the nanochemistry &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; sol&#8208;gel approach based on catalytic species entrapped in organically modified silicas as effective and versatile heterogeneous catalysts developed between the late 1990s and 2010 has succeeded. Subsequent developments will show how the use of said materials in automated syntheses, supplying data to machine learning algorithms actually leads to faster and cheaper optimization of the reaction conditions. Said progress ultimately will further accelerate industrial uptake of heterogeneous catalysis under flow in the fine chemical industry whose reluctance to change processes was due to the need to replace financially amortized (and expensive) production plants.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fluorination of the central ring of 1,3,5&#8208;benzene&#8208;tris&#8208;(meta&#8208;benzoate) (referred to as BTMB) leads to a twisted tritopic linker which reacts with copper(II) ions to assemble into octahedral (pseudospherical) metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) with paddle wheel units at their vertices. In this work, the different sphere packings of these MOCs are explored in detail together with their material properties, which closely resemble those of copper&#8208;based metal organic frameworks (MOFs). Theoretical investigations of the linkers are carried out to analyze the energetic barrier imposed by the fluorine substituents to form the observed atropisomers.</dc:description>

         <title>From Meteorite to Life&#8217;s Building Blocks: A possible Electrochemical Pathway to Amino Acids and Peptide Bonds.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study explores the electrochemical properties of the carbonaceous Allende CV3 meteorite, focusing on its potential as a Fe&#8208;based catalyst derived from Mackinawite iron sulfide for electrocatalytic reactions facilitating nitrogen (N2) fixation into ammonia. Through comprehensive analysis, we not only monitored the evolution of key compounds such as CN&#8208;, sulfur/H2S, H2 and carbonyl compounds, but also identified potential reagent carriers, indicating significant implications for the Strecker synthesis of amino acids in space environments. Initial examination revealed the presence of polypeptides, notably sequences including trimer Gly3, pentamer Gly3&#8208;Ala2, and hexamer Gly4&#8208;(HO&#8208;Gly)2. These discoveries greatly enhance our understanding of astrobiological chemistry, offering valuable insights into prebiotic processes and the potential presence of life&#8208;building blocks throughout the universe.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic&#8208;Structure Interpretation: How Much Do We Understand Ce L3 XANES?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 46, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article provides a brief overview of how Ce L3 XANES spectroscopy, especially in HERFD mode, can be utilized to investigate the electronic structure in cerium systems in a highly sophisticated manner. It addresses key questions relevant to chemists, material scientists and physicists, particularly regarding the oxidation state, ground&#8208;state configuration, electron occupation, and local structure near the Ce atom.







Abstract
Historically, cerium has been attractive for pharmaceutical and industrial applications. The cerium atom has the unique ability to cycle between two chemical states (Ce(III) and Ce(IV)) and drastically adjust its electronic configuration: [Xe] 4f15d16s2 in response to a chemical reaction. Understanding how electrons drive chemical reactions is an important topic. The most direct way of probing the chemical and electronic structure of materials is by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) or X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (XANES) in high energy resolution fluorescence detection (HERFD) mode. Such measurements at the Ce L3 edge have the advantage of a high penetration depth, enabling in&#8208;situ reaction studies in a time&#8208;resolved manner and investigation of material production or material performance under specific conditions. But how much do we understand Ce L3 XANES? This article provides an overview of the information that can be extracted from experimental Ce L3 XAS/XANES/HERFD data. A collection of XANES data recorded on various cerium systems in HERFD mode is presented here together with detailed discussions on data analysis and the current status of spectral interpretation, including electronic structure calculations.

         <title>The Diversity and Evolution of Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acid Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 46, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The number and complexity of chiral Br&#248;nsted acids are dramatically increasing, ultimately leading to unique generations of catalysts with enhanced reaction capabilities. In this concept article, we discuss how the approach to optimizing these structures have transitioned from foundational structural tuning to a function&#8208;driven approach.







Abstract
The chemical space of chiral Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts is defined by quantity and complexity, reflecting the diverse synthetic challenges confronted and the innovative molecular designs introduced. Here, we detail how this successful outcome is a powerful demonstration of the benefits of utilizing both local structure searches and a comprehensive understanding of catalyst performance for effective and efficient exploration of Br&#248;nsted acid properties. In this concept article we provide an evolutionary overview of this field by summarizing the approaches to catalyst optimization, the resulting structures, and functions.

         <title>Is the E/Z Iminium Ratio a Good Enantioselectivity Predictor in Iminium Catalysis?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 46, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article describes using mass spectrometry and ion mobility to determine the isomer ratio of organocatalyst iminium ions. These ions are involved in the enantioselective addition of nucleophiles to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. The isomer ratio, referred to as the &#8242;enantioselective potential&#8242;, is then compared with two reactions to evaluate its ability to predict enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Developing new enantioselective reactions is an important part of chemical discovery but requires time and resources to test large arrays of potential reaction conditions. New techniques are required to analyse many different reactions quickly and efficiently. Mass spectrometry is a high&#8208;throughput method; when combined with ion&#8208;mobility spectrometry, this technique can monitor diastereomeric reaction intermediates and thus be a handle to study enantioselective reactions. Through this technique and others, it was noted before that in the organocatalytic 1,4&#8208;addition to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, the abundance of initial diastereomeric intermediates correlates strongly to that of the final enantiomeric products. This work determines isomeric abundance for various catalysts and aldehydes and uses it to predict the enantiomeric excess of two control reactions. The prediction matches well for one reaction but does not predict the obtained results for the second. This finding confirms that the E/Z ratio of the iminium intermediates can be used as a predictor for some reactions, but the kinetics of the following steps can dramatically change the true enantioselectivity.

Mass spectrometry is a high-throughput method; when combined with ion-mobility spectrometry, this technique can monitor diastereomeric reaction intermediates and thus be a handle to study enantioselective reactions. Through this technique and others, it was noted before that in the organocatalytic 1,4-addition to &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated aldehydes, the abundance of initial diastereomeric intermediates correlates strongly to that of the final enantiomeric products. This work determines isomeric abundance for various catalysts and aldehydes and uses it to predict the enantiomeric excess of two control reactions.

         <title>A Schottky/Z&#8208;Scheme Hybrid for Augmented Photocatalytic H2 and H2O2 Production</title>

The MCNRBO Schottky/Z&#8208;scheme ternary hybrid possessing shortened charge transfer resistance along with improved separation efficiency and abundant charged species demonstrated stupendous photocatalytic H2 and H2O2 production.







Abstract
The prodigious employment of fossil fuels to conquer the global energy demand is becoming a dreadful threat to the human society. This predicament is appealing for a potent photocatalyst that can generate alternate energy sources via solar to chemical energy conversion. With this interest, we have fabricated a ternary heterostructure of Ti3C2 nanosheet modified g&#8208;C3N4/Bi2O3 (MCNRBO) Z&#8208;scheme photocatalyst through self&#8208;assembly process. The morphological analysis clearly evidenced the close interfacial interaction between g&#8208;C3N4 nanorod, Bi2O3 and Ti3C2 nanosheets. The oxygen vacancy created on Bi2O3 surface, as suggested by XPS and EPR analysis, supported the Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction formation between g&#8208;C3N4 nanorod and Bi2O3 nanosheets. The collaborative effect of Z&#8208;scheme and Schottky junction significantly reduced charge transfer resistance promoting separation efficiency of excitons as indicated from PL and EIS analysis. The potential of MCNRBO towards photocatalytic application was investigated by H2O2 and H2 evolution reaction. A superior photocatalytic H2O2 and H2 production rate for MCNRBO is observed, which are respectively around 5 and 18 folds higher as compared to pristine CNR nanorod. The present work encourages for the development of a noble, eco&#8208;benign and immensely efficient dual heterojunction based photocatalyst, which can acts as saviour of human society from energy crisis.

A family of stable pyridyl&#8208;substituted nitronyl nitroxides was synthesized. Magneto&#8208;structural correlations were established by XRD, magnetochemistry and quantum chemical calculations. Low&#8208;temperature XRD revealed phase transitions.







Abstract
A series of pyridyl&#8208;substituted nitronyl nitroxides was synthesized and structurally characterized. A comprehensive magnetochemical and quantum chemical study of extended raw of the nitroxides with different substituents R in the pyridine fragment was performed. It was shown, that temperature&#8208;dependent magnetic properties are determined by the short contacts between nitroxide groups of adjacent molecules as well as between nitroxide group and methyl substituents in the pseudo axial positions of imidazoline fragments. Quantum chemistry allows to select the appropriate model of exchange cluster for analysis of experimental magnetic data and evaluation of the exchange interaction parameters. For NN&#8211;PyCl the &#8220;order&#8208;disorder&#8221; transition was detected by means of low temperature XRD. The difference in the experimental and calculated exchange interaction energies may serve as an indicator of temperature&#8208;induced structural rearrangements. For instance, for methyl substituted nitronyl nitroxide NN&#8208;PyMe structural transformations and significant changes in exchange interaction energies were observed.

         <title>Expanding the &#960;&#8208;system of Fatty Acid&#8208;Anion Transporter Conjugates Modulates Their Mechanism of Proton Transport and Mitochondrial Uncoupling Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 46, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper we introduce a second phenyl substituent to the aryl urea scaffold and evaluate the proton transport mechanisms and mitochondrial uncoupling actions of these compounds against their monoarylated analogues. Notably, incorporation of meta&#8208; but not para&#8208;linked proximal rings enhanced proton transport and mitochondrial uncoupling actions in MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells, consistent with improved charge delocalisation by the urea anion binding group to produce membrane&#8208;permeable complexes.







Abstract
Mitochondrial uncoupling by small molecule protonophores is a promising strategy for developing novel anticancer agents. Recently, aryl urea substituted fatty acids (aryl ureas) were identified as a new class of protonophoric anticancer agents. To mediate proton transport these molecules self&#8208;assemble into membrane&#8208;permeable anionic dimers in which intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the carboxylate and aryl&#8208;urea anion receptor delocalise the negative charge across the aromatic &#960;&#8208;system. In this work, we extend the aromatic &#960;&#8208;system by introducing a second phenyl substituent to the aryl urea scaffold and compare the proton transport mechanisms and mitochondrial uncoupling actions of these compounds to their monoaryl analogues. It was found that incorporation of meta&#8208;linked phenyl substituents into the aryl urea scaffold enhanced proton transport in vesicles and demonstrated superior capacity to depolarise mitochondria, inhibit ATP production and reduce the viability of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 breast cancer cells. In contrast, diphenyl ureas linked through a 1,4&#8208;distribution across the phenyl ring displayed diminished proton transport activity, despite both diphenyl urea isomers possessing similar binding affinities for carboxylates. Mechanistic studies suggest that inclusion of a second aryl ring changes the proton transport mechanism, presumably due to steric factors that impose higher energy penalties for dimer formation.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Sulfoxide&#8208;Functionalized N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ruthenium Complexes: An Experimental and Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 46, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diastereoselective synthesis: A new family of sulfoxide&#8208;functionalized NHCs was created by a simple oxidation protocol from thioether&#8208;NHC. Associated with Ru(p&#8208;cymene), these NHC&#8208;SO ligands allow the formation of a single diastereomer in the form of an enantiomeric couple. This interesting selectivity is discussed by means of DFT calculations and experiments.







Abstract
The synthesis of sulfoxide&#8208;functionalized NHC ligand precursors were carried out by direct and mild oxidation from corresponding thioether precursors with high selectivity. Using these salts, a series of cationic [Ru(II)(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)(NHC&#8208;SO)Cl]+ complexes were obtained in excellent yields by the classical Ag2O transmetallation route. NMR analyses suggested a chelate structure for the metal complexes, and X&#8208;ray diffractometry studies of complexes 4&#8201;b, 4&#8201;c, 4dBArF and 4&#8201;e unambiguously confirmed the preference for the bidentate (&#954;2&#8208;C,S) coordination mode of the NHC&#8208;SO ligands. Interestingly, only one diastereomer, in the form of an enantiomeric pair, was observed both in 1H NMR and in the solid state for the complexes.

     alt="Diastereoselective Synthesis of Sulfoxide-Functionalized N-Heterocyclic Carbene Ruthenium Complexes: An Experimental and Computational Study"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diastereoselective synthesis: A new family of sulfoxide-functionalized NHCs was created by a simple oxidation protocol from thioether-NHC. Associated with Ru(p-cymene), these NHC-SO ligands allow the formation of a single diastereomer in the form of an enantiomeric couple. This interesting selectivity is discussed by means of DFT calculations and experiments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of sulfoxide-functionalized NHC ligand precursors were carried out by direct and mild oxidation from corresponding thioether precursors with high selectivity. Using these salts, a series of cationic [Ru(II)(&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-p&lt;/i&gt;-cymene)(NHC-SO)Cl]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; complexes were obtained in excellent yields by the classical Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O transmetallation route. NMR analyses suggested a chelate structure for the metal complexes, and X-ray diffractometry studies of complexes &lt;b&gt;4&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;4&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;4d&lt;sub&gt;BArF&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;4&#8201;e&lt;/b&gt; unambiguously confirmed the preference for the bidentate (&#954;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-&lt;i&gt;C,S&lt;/i&gt;) coordination mode of the NHC-SO ligands. Interestingly, only one diastereomer, in the form of an enantiomeric pair, was observed both in &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR and in the solid state for the complexes. DFT calculations showed a possible intrinsic energy difference between the two pairs of diastereomer. The calculated energy barriers suggested that inversion of the sulfoxide is only plausible from the higher energy diastereomer together with bulky substituents. Inverting the configuration at the Ru center instead shows a lower and accessible activation barrier to provide the most stable diastereomer through thermodynamic control, consistent with the observation of a single species by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR as a pair of enantiomers. All these complexes catalyse the &#946;-alkylation of secondary alcohols. Complex &lt;b&gt;4d&lt;sub&gt;PF6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; bearing an NHC-functionalised &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-Ad group has been further studied with different primary and secondary alcohols as substrates, showing high reactivity and high to moderate &#946;-ol-selectivities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Norbornadiene&#8208;Quadricyclane Photoswitches with Enhanced Solar Spectrum Match</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 46, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Norbornadiene absorbs in the UV region making it unsuitable for molecular solar thermal energy storage. A new series of visible light&#8208;absorbing norbornadienes were synthesized and evaluated. The strategy displayed a pronounced solar spectrum match pushing absorption onset to 595&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Herein, we report monomeric and dimeric norbornadiene&#8208;quadricyclane molecular photoswitch systems intended for molecular solar thermal applications. A series of six new norbornadiene derivatives conjugated with benzothiadiazole as the acceptor unit and dithiafulvene as the donor unit were synthesized and fully characterized. The photoswitches were evaluated by experimentally and theoretically measuring optical absorption profiles and thermal conversion of quadricyclane to norbornadiene. Computational insight by density functional theory calculations at the M06&#8208;2X/def2&#8208;SVPD level of theory provided geometries, storage energies, UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra, and HOMO&#8208;LUMO levels that are used to describe the function of the molecular systems. The studied molecules exhibit absorption onset ranging from 416&#8197;nm to 595&#8197;nm due to a systemic change in their donor&#8208;acceptor character. This approach was advantageous due to the introduction of benzothiadiazole and the dimeric nature of molecular structures. The best&#8208;performing system has a half&#8208;life of 3&#8197;days with quantum yields over 50&#8201;%.

         <title>Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Construction of Stereochemical Arrays Exploiting Non&#8208;Classical Hydrogen Bonding in Enolborates</title>

Arrays bearing contiguous stereocenters are generated by a copper&#8208;catalyzed reductive aldol reaction. Cyclic, acyclic, fused and spirocyclic aldols were prepared with excellent yields, diastereoselectivities, and in some cases, enantioselectivities. DFT calculations reveal that the transition state for the enolborate aldol is stabilized by non&#8208;classical hydrogen bonding interactions.







Abstract
We report a copper&#8208;catalyzed reductive aldol addition to aldehydes and ketones, with pinacolborane as stoichiometric reductant, that results in the generation of stereodefined syn&#8208;aldol products. Cyclic, acyclic, fused and spirocyclic aldols bearing contiguous stereocenters are obtained with excellent yields and diastereoselectivities. Moreover, enantioselective reactions could be carried out with cycloalkenones to deliver aldols bearing three contiguous stereocenters and with up to 98&#8201;% ee. Computations reveal that the enolborate intermediate undergoes the syn&#8208;aldol reaction via a twist&#8208;boat transition state that is stabilized by non&#8208;classical hydrogen bonding interactions.

This study shows how intermolecular interactions in a solid can deform a seemingly rigid molecule. It is one of the rare cases where a series of structural determinations in the crystalline phase and a highly reliable structural determination in the gaseous state by electron diffraction are available. As a heavy element containing structure of a free molecule it can also serve as a reference for the evaluation and development of quantum chemical methods.







Abstract
The geometric and electronic structure of [Hg(o&#8208;C6F4)]3 (1) in the gas phase, i.&#8201;e. free of intermolecular interactions, was determined by a synchronous gas&#8208;phase electron diffraction/mass spectrometry experiment (GED/MS), complemented by quantum chemical calculations. 1 is stable up to 498&#8197;K and the gas phase contains a single molecular form: the trimer [Hg(o&#8208;C6F4)]3. It has a planar structure of D3h symmetry with a Hg&#8211;C distance of 2.075(5)&#8197;&#197; and a Hg&#8211;Hg distance of 3.614(7)&#8197;&#197; (both rh1). Structural differences between the crystalline and gaseous state have been analyzed. Different DFT functional&#8208;basis combinations were tested, demonstrating the importance to consider the relativistic effects of the mercury atoms. The combination PBE0/MWB(Hg),cc&#8208;pVTZ(C,F) turned out to be the most appropriate for the geometry optimization of such organomercurials. The electronic structure of 1, the nature of the chemical bonding in C&#8722;Hg&#8722;C fragments and the nature of the Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg interactions have been analyzed in terms of the Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) and Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) approaches. The influence of the nature of halogen substitution on the structure of the molecules in the series [Hg(o&#8208;C6H4)]3, [Hg(o&#8208;C6F4)]3, [Hg(o&#8208;C6Cl4)]3, [Hg(o&#8208;C6Br4)]3 was also analyzed.

         <title>Photoredox Catalysis by 21&#8208;Thiaporphyrins: A Green and Efficient Approach for C&#8722;N Borylation and C&#8722;H Arylation</title>

The photocatalytic C&#8722;N borylation and het&#8208;arylation of anilines is reported using 21&#8208;thiaporphyrins. The method is versatile and a series of heterobiaryls and aryl boronic esters are prepared in decent yields (up to 88&#8201;%) with only 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of 21&#8208;thiaporphyrin catalyst under blue light. DFT studies suggest that 21&#8208;thiaporphyrin donates electron to the substrate and undergo oxidative quenching pathway during the reaction.







Abstract
Photoredox catalysis provides a green and sustainable alternative for C&#8722;H activation of organic molecules that eludes harsh conditions and use of transition metals. The photocatalytic C&#8722;N borylation and C&#8722;H arylation mostly depend on the ruthenium and iridium complexes or eosin Y and the use of porphyrin catalysts is still in infancy. A series of novel 21&#8208;thiaporphyrins (A2B2 and A3B type) were synthesized having carbazole/phenothiazine moieties at their meso&#8208;positions and screened as catalysts for C&#8722;N borylation and C&#8722;H arylation. This paper demonstrates the 21&#8208;thiaporphyrin catalyzed C&#8722;N borylation and het&#8208;arylation of anilines under visible light. The method utilizes only 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of 21&#8208;thiaporphyrin catalyst under blue light for the direct C&#8722;N borylation and het&#8208;arylation reactions. A variety of substituted anilines were used as source for expensive and unstable aryl diazonium salts in the reactions. The heterobiaryls and aryl boronic esters were obtained in decent yields (up to 88&#8197;%). Versatility of the 21&#8208;thiaporphyrin catalyst was tested by thiolation and selenylation of anilines under similar conditions. Mechanistic insight was obtained from DFT studies, suggesting that 21&#8208;thiaporphyrin undergo an oxidative quenching pathway. The photoredox process catalyzed by 21&#8208;thiaporphyrins offers a mild, efficient and metal&#8208;free alternative for the formation of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;S, and C&#8722;Se bonds in aryl compounds; it can also be extended to borylation reaction.

         <title>Advancing Nitrile&#8208;Aminothiol Strategy for Dual and Sequential Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 46, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrile&#8208;aminothiol chemistry for one&#8208;pot bioconjugation is reported, highlighting its versatility and efficiency. This method enables dual, sequential, and orthogonal bioconjugation, facilitating multiple modifications in a single reaction. The approach simplifies complex biochemical processes, providing a streamlined and effective solution for advanced bioconjugation applications in research and development.







Abstract
Nitrile&#8208;aminothiol conjugation (NATC) stands out as a promising biocompatible ligation technique due to its high chemo&#8208;selectivity. Herein we investigated the reactivity and substrate scope of NAT conjugation chemistry, thus developing a novel pH dependent orthogonal NATC as a valuable tool for chemical biology. The study of reaction kinetics elucidated that the combination of heteroaromatic nitrile and aminothiol groups led to the formation of an optimal bioorthogonal pairing, which is pH dependent. This pairing system was effectively utilized for sequential and dual conjugation. Subsequently, these rapid (&#8776;1&#8197;h) and high yield (&gt;90&#8201;%) conjugation strategies were successfully applied to a broad range of complex biomolecules, including oligonucleotides, chelates, small molecules and peptides. The effectiveness of this conjugation chemistry was demonstrated by synthesizing a fluorescently labelled antimicrobial peptide&#8208;oligonucleotide complex as a dual conjugate to imaging in live cells. This first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind sequential NATC approach unveils unprecedented opportunities in modern chemical biology, showcasing exceptional adaptability in rapidly creating structurally complex bioconjugates. Furthermore, the results highlight its potential for versatile applications across fundamental and translational biomedical research.

A series of Ni bis&#8208;1,1&#8208;dithiolate complexes provide the basis for a spectroscopic and computational study that tracks the substituent electronic effects with the observed properties through 13C NMR chemical shifts and electronic spectra. The underlying redox innocence of the ligand is established and contrasted with its dithiolene isomers.







Abstract
A series of homoleptic Ni bis&#8208;1,1&#8208;dithiolates, [Ni(S2C2RR&#8242;)2]2&#8722; (R=CN, R&#8242;=CN, CO2Et, CONH2, Ph, Ph&#8208;4&#8208;Cl, Ph&#8208;4&#8208;OMe, Ph&#8208;4&#8208;NO2, Ph&#8208;3&#8208;CF3, Ph&#8208;4&#8208;CF3, Ph&#8208;4&#8208;CN; R=NO2, R&#8242;=H; R=R&#8242;=CO2Et) have been synthesized from the reaction of the alkali metal salt of the ligand and nickel chloride, and isolated as tetraphenylphosphonium or tetrabutylammonium salts. The complexes were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, and infrared (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electronic absorption spectroscopies. The molecular structures show a rigidly square planar Ni(II) center linking two four&#8208;membered chelate rings whose dimensions are constant across the series. The electronic effect of the ligand substituent is revealed in the 13C NMR and electronic spectra, and corroborated by density functional calculations. Electron withdrawing groups deshield the low&#8208;field CS2 resonance, and the signature charge transfer band in the visible region is red&#8208;shifted. These observables have been accurately reproduced computationally, and revealed the Ni contribution to the ground state diminishes with decreasing electron withdrawing capacity of the ligand substituent. In contrast to 1,2&#8208;dithiolates, the redox inactivity afforded by 1,1&#8208;dithiolates stems from the smaller chelate ring and substantially reduced sulfur content that is key to stabilizing the radical form.

         <title>Masking the Bioactivity of Hydroxamic Acids by Coordination to Cobalt: Towards Bioreductive Anticancer Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 46, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By coordinating the anticancer drug vorinostat to a Co(III) center, the antiproliferative activity of the bioactive molecule is diminished by two orders of magnitude. The low bioactivity could be related to the marginal uptake of the Co&#8208;vorinostat complexes into cancer cells.







Abstract
The clinical use of many potent anticancer agents is limited by their non&#8208;selective toxicity to healthy tissue. One of these examples is vorinostat (SAHA), a pan histone deacetylase inhibitor, which shows high cytotoxicity with limited discrimination for cancerous over healthy cells. In an attempt to improve tumor selectivity, we exploited the properties of cobalt(III) as a redox&#8208;active metal center through stabilization with cyclen and cyclam tetraazamacrocycles, masking the anticancer activity of SAHA and other hydroxamic acid derivatives to allow for the complex to reach the hypoxic microenvironment of the tumor. Biological assays demonstrated the desired low in&#8197;vitro anticancer activity of the complexes, suggesting effective masking of the activity of SAHA. Once in the tumor, the bioactive moiety may be released through the reduction of the CoIII center. Investigations revealed long&#8208;term stability of the complexes, with cyclic voltammetry and chemical reduction experiments supporting the design hypothesis of SAHA release through the reduction of the CoIII prodrug. The results highlight the potential for further developing this complex class as novel anticancer agents by masking the high cytotoxicity of a given drug, however, the cellular uptake needs to be improved.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clinical use of many potent anticancer agents is limited by their non-selective toxicity to healthy tissue. One of these examples is vorinostat (SAHA), a pan histone deacetylase inhibitor, which shows high cytotoxicity with limited discrimination for cancerous over healthy cells. In an attempt to improve tumor selectivity, we exploited the properties of cobalt(III) as a redox-active metal center through stabilization with cyclen and cyclam tetraazamacrocycles, masking the anticancer activity of SAHA and other hydroxamic acid derivatives to allow for the complex to reach the hypoxic microenvironment of the tumor. Biological assays demonstrated the desired low &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; anticancer activity of the complexes, suggesting effective masking of the activity of SAHA. Once in the tumor, the bioactive moiety may be released through the reduction of the Co&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; center. Investigations revealed long-term stability of the complexes, with cyclic voltammetry and chemical reduction experiments supporting the design hypothesis of SAHA release through the reduction of the Co&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; prodrug. The results highlight the potential for further developing this complex class as novel anticancer agents by masking the high cytotoxicity of a given drug, however, the cellular uptake needs to be improved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Phosphanyl Phosphagermene and its Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 46, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a phosphanyl phosphagermene described. Two principal reactivity modes were observed for this novel compound. On the one hand, it reacts as a geminal frustrated Lewis pair towards CO2 and nitriles. By contrast, with amines and metal complexes, the P=Ge double bond reacts in 1,2&#8208;addition reactions.







Abstract
Reaction of a nucleophilic germylene Ge[CH(SiMe3)2]2 with the phosphanyl phosphaketene [{(H2C)(NDipp)}2P]PCO induces decarbonylation to form a phosphanyl phosphagermene [{(H2C)(NDipp)}2P]P=Ge[CH(SiMe3)2]2 (1; Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropyl&#8208;phenyl). Addition of CO2 or MeCN to 1 results in [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reactions to afford five&#8208;membered heterocycles. This mode of reactivity is reminiscent of that observed for frustrated Lewis pairs, with the pendant phosphanyl group acting as a base and the germanium center as a Lewis acid. Contrastingly, 1,2&#8208;addition across the P=Ge bond was observed when using ammonia, small primary amines (NH2nP), or metal complexes (e.&#8201;g. Au(PPh3)Cl and ZnEt2). These latter reactions allow for the one&#8208;step synthesis of metal phosphide complexes.

The Pd&#8208;catalysed decarboxylative asymmetric allylic alkylation (DAAA) has been developed for sterically hindered benzofuran&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;one derived &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto esters. The key step in the substrate synthesis employed previously developed Pb&#8208;mediated &#945;&#8208;arylation. A substrate scope of 17 examples of DAAA showed that substrates containing a di&#8208;ortho substitution pattern on the aryl ring as well as naphthyl&#8208;containing substrates gave rise to highest enantioselectivities of up to 96&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
The Pd&#8208;catalysed decarboxylative asymmetric allylic alkylation (DAAA) has been applied to the enantioselective synthesis of sterically hindered benzofuran&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;one&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto esters employing the (R,R)&#8208;ANDEN phenyl Trost ligand. A range of substrates were synthesised, employing previously developed aryllead triacetate methodology to install various aryl groups. The resulting &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;allyl benzofuran&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;one DAAA products were obtained in moderate to high yields and in enantioselectivities of up to 96&#8201;% ee, with the best results observed for substrates containing a di&#8208;ortho&#8208;substitution pattern on the aryl ring as well as naphthyl&#8208;containing substrates.

         <title>Spectroscopic Manifestations of (Anti)Aromaticity in Oxidized and Reduced Porphyrin and Norcorrole</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 46, August 19, 2024. </description>

Spectroelectrochemical studies of porphyrin and norcorrole reveal how the vis&#8208;NIR spectra report (anti)aromaticity, which switches upon oxidation and reduction. In contrast, the IR spectra are less informative.







Abstract
Aromaticity and antiaromaticity are foundational principes in organic chemistry, regularly invoked to explain stability, structure, and magnetic and electronic properties. There are ongoing challenges in assigning molecules as aromatic or antiaromatic using optical spectroscopy. Here we report spectroelectrochemical and computational analyses of porphyrin (18&#960; neutral, aromatic) and norcorrole (16&#960; neutral, antiaromatic), and their oxidized (16&#960; porphyrin dication) and reduced (norcorrole 18&#960; dianion) forms. Our results show that while the visible spectra are characteristic of (anti)aromaticity consistent with H&#252;ckel's rules, the IR spectra are much less informative, owing to the relative rigidity of norcorrole. The results have implications for the assignment of (anti)aromaticity in both ground&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectra.

         <title>Unveiling the Reactivity of Part Per Million Levels of Cobalt&#8208;Salen Complexes in Hydrosilylation of Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 46, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient strategy is developed for the synthesis of organosilicon compounds and corresponding secondary alcohols through the hydrosilylation of ketones utilizing ppm levels of inexpensive Cobalt&#8208;Salen complex. The developed reaction protocol features a broad substrate scope coupled with good selectivity, excellent turnover number (up to 2,00,000), applicability in gram scale synthesis and mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
A series of air&#8208;stable cobalt(III)salen complexes Co&#8208;1 to Co&#8208;4 have been synthesized and employed in the hydrosilylation of ketones. Notably, the most intricately tailored Co&#8208;3 pre&#8208;catalyst exhibited exceptional catalytic activity under mild reaction conditions. The developed catalytic hydrosilylation protocol proceeded with an unusual ppm level (5&#8197;ppm) catalyst loading of Co&#8208;3 and achieved a maximum turnover number (TON) of 200,000. A wide variety of aromatic, aliphatic, and heterocyclic ketones encompassing both electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents were successfully transformed into the desired silyl ethers or secondary alcohols in moderate to excellent yields.

An acridone&#8208;based ligand with rotatable isoquinoline donor arms shows high versatility to create multiple types of assemblies. From a homoleptic mesocate and helicate to heteroleptic cages, it can also lead to the formation of an unprecedented six&#8208;jagged Pd6L12 ring in the solid state.







Abstract
Molecular building blocks, capable of adopting several strongly deviating conformations, are of particular interest in the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assemblies. The pronounced structural flexibility of a short acridone&#8208;based bridging ligand, equipped with two monodentate isoquinoline donors, is herein exploited to assemble a surprisingly diverse series of coordination&#8208;driven Pd(II) architectures. First, it can form a highly twisted Pd2L4 helicate, transformable into the corresponding mesocate, controlled by temperature, counter anion and choice of solvent. Second, it also allows the formation of heteroleptic cages, either from a mix of ligands with Pd(II) cations or by cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformation from homoleptic assemblies. Here, the acridone&#8208;based ligand tolerates counter ligands that carry their donors either in a diverging or converging arrangement, as it can rotate its own coordination sites by 90&#176; and structurally adapt to both situations via shape complementarity. Third, by a near 180&#176; rotation of only one of its arms, the ligand can adopt an S&#8208;shape conformation and form an unprecedented C6h&#8208;symmetric Pd6L12 saw&#8208;toothed six&#8208;membered ring.

A &#8216;two&#8208;point&#8217; metal&#8208;ligand coordination approach has been developed to construct a multimodular donor&#8208;acceptor conjugate featuring &#960;&#8208;connected bis zinc porphyrin&#8208;bisstrylBODIPY and bipyridine functionalized fulleropyrrolidine. Upon full characterization of this conjugate by a suite of physico&#8208;chemical and time&#8208;dependent DFT studies, occurrence of ultrafast energy transfer from excited zinc porphyrin to bisstrylBODIPY and electron transfer involving C60 in the conjugate is demonstrated using femtosecond pump&#8208;probe technique.







Abstract
Structurally well&#8208;defined self&#8208;assembled supramolecular multi&#8208;modular donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates play a significant role in furthering our understanding of photoinduced energy and electron transfer events occurring in nature, e.&#8201;g., in the antenna&#8208;reaction centers of photosynthesis and their applications in light energy harvesting. However, building such multi&#8208;modular systems capable of mimicking the early events of photosynthesis has been synthetically challenging, causing a major hurdle for its growth. Often, multi&#8208;modularity is brought in by combining both covalent and noncovalent approaches. In the present study, we have developed such an approach wherein a &#960;&#8208;extended conjugated molecular cleft, two zinc(II)porphyrin bearing bisstyrylBODIPY (dyad, 1), has been synthesized. The binding of 1 via a &#8216;two&#8208;point&#8217; metal&#8208;ligand coordination of a bis&#8208;pyridyl fulleropyrrolidine (2), forming a stable self&#8208;assembled supramolecular complex (1&#8201;:&#8201;2), has been established. The self&#8208;assembled supramolecular complex has been fully characterized by a suite of physico&#8208;chemical methods, including TD&#8208;DFT studies. From the established energy diagram, both energy and electron transfer events were envisioned. In dyad 1, selective excitation of zinc(II)porphyrin leads to efficient singlet&#8208;singlet excitation transfer to (bisstyrly)BODIPY with an energy transfer rate constant, kEnT of 2.56&#215;1012&#8197;s&#8722;1. In complex 1&#8201;:&#8201;2, photoexcitation of zinc(II)porphyrin results in ultrafast photoinduced electron transfer with a charge separation rate constant, kCS of 2.83&#215;1011&#8197;s&#8722;1, and a charge recombination rate constant, kCR of 2.51&#215;109&#8197;s&#8722;1. For excitation at 730&#8197;nm corresponding to bisstyrylBODIPY, similar results are obtained, where a biexponential decay yielded estimated values of kCS 3.44&#215;1011&#8197;s&#8722;1 and 2.97&#215;1010&#8197;s&#8722;1, and a kCR value of 2.10&#215;1010&#8197;s&#8722;1. The newly built self&#8208;assembled supramolecular complex has been shown to successfully mimic the early events of the photosynthetic antenna&#8208;reaction center events.

The silyloxy&#8208;substituted carbons of 1,4&#8208;bis(silyloxy)&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclopentadienes prepared from 2,2&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclopentanediones exhibit unique reactivities. Despite being sterically hindered, one of these carbons attacks on the carbocation generated at the &#948;&#8208;position to form a 4,5&#8208;cis&#8208;fused ring skeleton. Subsequent skeletal rearrangement of the bicyclic core produces the corresponding 2&#8208;silyloxy&#8208;2&#8208;norbornen&#8208;7&#8208;one.







Abstract
We describe a method for the synthesis of various 2&#8208;silyloxy&#8208;2&#8208;norbornen&#8208;7&#8208;ones by exploiting the specific reactivity of the 1,4&#8208;bis(silyloxy)&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclopentadiene framework, which is generated by the silylation of a 2,2&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclopentanedione bearing a picolinoyloxy group at the 2&#8242; position of its C&#8208;2 side chain. The release of the acyloxy group during the reaction generates carbocations that are then attacked by silyloxy&#8208;substituted carbons in the 1,4&#8208;bis(silyloxy)&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclopentadiene moiety skeleton, forming a 4,5&#8208;cis&#8208;fused ring skeleton. Skeletal rearrangement of the bicyclic core results in the formation of the corresponding 2&#8208;silyloxy&#8208;2&#8208;norbornen&#8208;7&#8208;one. This novel transformation of 1,3&#8208;cyclopentanedione moieties can be used to synthesise other cyclopentenone&#8208;fused bicyclic frameworks.

         <title>Structural Flexibility is a Decisive Factor in FLP Dihydrogen Cleavage with Tetrahedral Lewis Acids: A Silane Case Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 46, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Why is dihydrogen activation with frustrated Lewis pairs based on tetrahedral Lewis acids that intricate? This study answers the question by means of a statistical analysis of an ensemble of &lt;1500 encounter complexes. It reveals that the formation of &#8220;active&#8221; EC is far less likely for tetrahedral Lewis acids compared to trigonal Lewis acids, slowing down dihydrogen splitting despite similar transition state energies.







Abstract
Dihydrogen activation is the paradigmatic reaction of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs). While trigonal&#8208;planar Lewis acids have been well established in this transformation, tetrahedral Lewis acids are surprisingly limited. Indeed, several cases were computed as thermodynamically and kinetically feasible but exhibit puzzling discrepancies with experimental results. In the present study, a computational investigation of the factors influencing dihydrogen activation are considered by large ensemble sampling of encounter complexes, deformation energies and the activation strain model for a silicon/nitrogen FLP and compared with a boron/phosphorous FLP. The analysis adds the previously missing dimension of Lewis acids&#8217; structural flexibility as a factor that influences preexponential terms beyond pure transition state energies. It sheds light on the origin of &#8220;overfrustration&#8221; (defined herein), indicates structural constraint in Lewis acids as a linchpin for activation of weak donor substrates, and allows drawing a more refined mechanistic picture of this emblematic reactivity.

         <title>Chemical Predictive Modelling and Natural Product&#8208;based Divergent Synthesis &#8211; Design of Type B PPAPs with Nanomolar Activities against MRSA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 46, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In response to antibiotic resistance, a late&#8208;stage divergent synthesis approach was used to synthesize 30 new type B PPAPs for SAR studies against MRSA. AI&#8208;trained 3D&#8208;QSAR models based on cellular assay data, were used to screen a virtual compound, and the 20 most promising candidates were synthesized. Significant anti&#8208;MRSA activity at nanomolar concentration was demonstrated by these novel PPAPs.







Abstract
In response to the pressing global challenge of antibiotic resistance, time efficient design and synthesis of novel antibiotics are of immense need. Polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols (PPAP) were previously reported to effectively combat a range of gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Although the exact mode of action is still not clear, we conceptualized a late&#8208;stage divergent synthesis approach to expand our natural product&#8208;based PPAP library by 30 additional entities to perform SAR studies against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Although at this point only data from cellular assays are available and understanding of molecular drug&#8208;target interactions are lacking, the experimental data were used to generate 3D&#8208;QSAR models via an artificial intelligence training and to identify a common pharmacophore model. The experimentally validated QSAR model enabled the estimation of anti&#8208;MRSA activities of a virtual compound library consisting of more than 100,000 in&#8208;silico generated B PPAPs, out of which the 20 most promising candidates were synthesized. These novel PPAPs revealed significantly improved cellular activities against MRSA with growth inhibition down to concentrations less than 1&#8197;&#956;m.

The rhodium/Me&#8208;ferrocelane&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric intramolecular hydroalkoxylation of allenyl alcohols is reported. It provides selective access to 5&#8208;, 6&#8208; and 7&#8208;membered cyclic allyl ethers, scaffolds found in a large variety of pharmaceutical interesting and bioactive (natural) products. The gram scale preparation and functionalizations of the thus obtained product were demonstrated. Finally, we applied our novel method in a 2nd generation total synthesis of (R,R,R)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;tocopherol improving the overall efficiency significantly (9 steps in total and 38&#8201;% yield for chiral chromane building block).







Abstract
We report herein of a novel, enantioselective and rhodium&#8208; catalyzed cyclisation of allenyl alcohols towards chiral &#945;&#8208;vinylic, cyclic ethers employing a rhodium/(R,R)&#8208;Me&#8208;ferrocelane catalyst. The corresponding chiral cyclic products were obtained in general high yields and enantioselectivities. The synthetic value of our obtained products was further exemplified by transformations of the allylic ether function. Furthermore, applying our newly developed method in our previously reported route towards the total synthesis of (R,R,R)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;tocopherol, we accomplished a significantly improved 2nd generation synthesis of the chromane building providing a total number of 13 steps and an overall total yield of 27&#8201;%.

         <title>Highly Efficient Quenching of Singlet Oxygen by DNA Origami Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 46, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by DNA origami nanostructures is investigated in an antimicrobial photodynamic therapy setting, using light irradiation of methylene blue to generate a mixture of radicals and singlet oxygen. DNA origami nanostructures are found to be vastly superior to genomic double&#8208;stranded DNA and established ROS scavengers in protecting the bacteria from ROS&#8208;induced damage.







Abstract
DNA origami nanostructures (DONs) are able to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) and their scavenging efficiency toward ROS radicals was shown to be comparable to that of genomic DNA. Herein, we demonstrate that DONs are highly efficient singlet oxygen quenchers outperforming double&#8208;stranded (ds) DNA by several orders of magnitude. To this end, a ROS mixture rich in singlet oxygen is generated by light irradiation of the photosensitizer methylene blue and its cytotoxic effect on Escherichia coli cells is quantified in the presence and absence of DONs. DONs are found to be vastly superior to dsDNA in protecting the bacteria from ROS&#8208;induced damage and even surpass established ROS scavengers. At a concentration of 15&#8197;nM, DONs are about 50&#8201;000 times more efficient ROS scavengers than dsDNA at an equivalent concentration. This is attributed to the dominant role of singlet oxygen, which has a long diffusion length and reacts specifically with guanine. The dense packing of the available guanines into the small volume of the DON increases the overall quenching probability compared to a linear dsDNA with the same number of base pairs. DONs thus have great potential to alleviate oxidative stress caused by singlet oxygen in diverse therapeutic settings.

         <title>Redox Active Ligands for Catalyzing the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 46, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single reduction of boron subphthalocyanines and antimony corroles is sufficient for the conversion of protons to hydrogen in a catalytic process that involves only the macrocyclic ligands in the redox events. The proton&#8208;activation step involves the peripheral N and meso&#8208;C atoms of the former and latter complexes, respectively.







Abstract
Boron subphthalocyanines with chloride and fluoride axial ligands and three antimony complexes chelated by corroles that differ in size and electron&#8208;richness were examined as electrocatalysts for reduction of protons to hydrogen. Experiment&#8208; and computation&#8208;based investigations revealed that all redox events are ligand&#8208;centered and that the meso&#8208;C of the corroles and the peripheral N atoms of the subphthalocyanines are the largely preferred proton&#8208;binding sites.

         <title>Tuning the Flavin Core via Donor Appendage for Selective Subcellular Bioimaging and PDT Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 46, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a novel design around flavin core skeleton incorporating a methoxy&#8208;naphthyl appendage is reported. The novel flavin entity was found to be highly emissive probe for selective lysosome bioimaging application. Furthermore, photosensitization capability of the mNF was evaluated for photodynamic therapy application against the B16 skin cancer cells.







Abstract
Herein, we report a novel flavin analogue as singular chemical component for lysosome bioimaging, and inherited photosensitizer capability of the flavin core was demonstrated as a promising candidate for photodynamic therapy (PDT) application. Fine&#8208;tuning the flavin core with the incorporation of methoxy naphthyl appendage provides an appropriate chemical design, thereby offering photostability, selectivity, and lysosomal colocalization, along with the aggregation&#8208;induced emissive nature, making it suitable for lysosomal bioimaging applications. Additionally, photosensitization capability of the flavin core with photostable nature of the synthesized analogue has shown remarkable capacity for generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) within cells, making it a promising candidate for photodynamic therapy (PDT) application.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report a novel flavin analogue as singular chemical component for lysosome bioimaging, and inherited photosensitizer capability of the flavin core was demonstrated as a promising candidate for photodynamic therapy (PDT) application. Fine-tuning the flavin core with the incorporation of methoxy naphthyl appendage provides an appropriate chemical design, thereby offering photostability, selectivity, and lysosomal colocalization, along with the aggregation-induced emissive nature, making it suitable for lysosomal bioimaging applications. Additionally, photosensitization capability of the flavin core with photostable nature of the synthesized analogue has shown remarkable capacity for generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) within cells, making it a promising candidate for photodynamic therapy (PDT) application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Front Cover: Unique Reactivity of the 1,4&#8208;Bis(silyloxy)&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclopentadiene Moiety: Application to the Synthesis of 7&#8208;Norbornanone Derivatives (Chem. Eur. J. 46/2024)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 46, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover illustrates the unique transformation of 1,3&#8208;cyclopentanedione by using silylating reagents in a manner analogous to alchemy. Although a carbonyl carbon does not generally show nucleophilicity, our developed reaction system enables the carbonyl carbon in the 1,3&#8208;cyclopentadione motif to behave as a nucleophile. This technique led to success in a cyclization to form a cyclobutane ring, and the resulting bicyclic compound was subsequently transformed into a 7&#8208;norbornanone derivative by skeletal rearrangement. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Ikeuchi, K. Tanino, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401908).

The Cover Feature shows the Samuel Beckett bridge and the Convention Centre Dublin beside the river Liffey. The Convention Centre is the venue for the 9th EuChemS Congress being held in July 2024. The chemistry scheme shows a racemic &#946;&#8208;keto allyl ester and the two diastereomeric transition states, the one on top leading to the preferred enantiomer (98&#8201;%) and the one on the bottom leading to the disfavoured enantiomer (2&#8201;%). The image captures the mirror effect as the Convention Centre has its mirror image blurred on the river Liffey. More information can be found in the Research Article by P.&#8197;J.

         <title>Cover Feature: Highly Efficient Quenching of Singlet Oxygen by DNA Origami Nanostructures (Chem. Eur. J. 46/2024)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 46, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The scavenging of singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen species by DNA origami nanostructures is explored in an antimicrobial photodynamic therapy setting. While genomic double&#8208;stranded DNA is a poor quencher of singlet oxygen, folding it into DNA origami nanostructures results in a drastically increased singlet oxygen quenching efficiency. DNA origami nanostructures thus have great potential to alleviate the oxidative stress caused by singlet oxygen in diverse therapeutic settings. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Keller and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202402057).

         <title>Evolutionary Abilities of Minimalistic Physicochemical Models of Life Processes</title>

Autocatalytic cycles constituted solely of unstable chemical intermediates (represented with asterisks) can in principle exist in a state of Dynamic Kinetic Stability (DKS). These Emerging Autonomous Systems (EASs) feature properties of living organisms and can emerge as well as they can &#8220;die&#8221;. They may constitute primordial systems able to initiate a process of selection anticipating natural selection.







Abstract
The ability of living organisms to persist, grow, evolve and invade environments seemingly challenges physical laws. Emerging Autonomous Systems representing autocatalytic cycles constituted of energized components in a state of Dynamic Kinetic Stability feature some of these properties. These simple theoretical models can grow, can be transferred but need an initiation to emerge and can collapse. Moreover, they can undergo kinetic selection in a way consistent with Darwinian behaviour, though they lack the ability to undergo change. The mere existence of these systems and their open&#8208;ended growth potential are proposed to constitute a transmissible factor of a non&#8208;coded kind. The onset and selection of epigenetic factors may therefore have preceded that of genetic polymers. Here is addressed the question of how these systems may arise from the diversity exhibited by abiotic organic matter, sometimes associated with intractable mixtures, which may actually be useful in providing initiators. The Darwinian description of evolution may therefore be merged without critical discontinuity within an origin scenario. Accordingly, such a theory would rests solely on physicochemical laws beginning with the potential of emerging autonomous systems to compete and invade the space dimension, and to further develop along other available dimensions including variability and, possibly, cognition.

         <dc:description>
Boron difluoride (BF2) complexes with asymmetrical N,N&#8217;&#8208;bidentate ligands have demonstrated fascinating properties and found broad applications in various fields. They are generally constructed in two steps: ligand formation, followed by boron complexation. Herein, we categorize BF2 complexes based on the key synthetic strategies that have been applied in the ligand formation steps.







Abstract
Boron difluoride (BF2) complexes with asymmetrical N,N&#8217;&#8208;bidentate ligands have received increasing attention due to their fascinating properties and broad applications. They are generally constructed in two steps: ligand formation, followed by boron complexation. This review focuses on categorizing these BF2 complexes based on the key synthetic strategies that have been applied in the ligand formation steps. The post&#8208;functionalization, properties and applications of different types of BF2 complexes are presented. Their challenges and opportunities are also discussed. This should help the future rational design and synthesis of BF2 complexes with intriguing properties and practical applications.

         <title>Quantitative Reactivity Models for Oxidative Addition to L2Pd(0): Additional Substrate Classes, Solvents, and Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantitative molecular structure&#8208;reactivity models are useful for generating predictions to guide synthesis design, and in formulating and testing mechanistic hypotheses. We report an expanded multivariate linear regression (MLR) model for the rate of (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halide oxidative addition to L2Pd(0), here exemplified by Pd(PCy3)2. This builds on a prior model from our group, with additional substrate classes (aryl chlorides and iodides) and reaction solvents (THF, toluene, THF/DMF mixture). Overall solvent effects across the entire substrate set are minimal under these conditions, enabling a unified MLR model without introduction of new molecular descriptors beyond the original five. Examining the mechanistic origin of the two molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) descriptors led to generation of a simpler, four descriptor model that is suitable for aryl halides, but not for 2&#8208;halopyridines. Using this model we identified a mechanistic outlier, 2&#8208;pyridyl triflate, which undergoes a nucleophilic displacement oxidative addition that does not involve the adjacent nitrogen atom. Finally, we discuss the relationship between C&#8211;X bond strength and oxidative addition rates, and compare the intrinsic bond strength index (IBSI) to bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE) as a bond strength descriptor.</dc:description>

         <title>Interrogating Explicit Solvent Effects on the Mechanism and Site&#8208;Selectivity of Aryl Halide Oxidative Addition to L2Pd(0)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a study of solvent effects on the rate, selectivity, and mechanism of (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halide oxidative addition to Pd(PCy3)2 as an exemplar of L2Pd(0) species. First, 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;aminopyridine is observed to undergo faster oxidative addition in toluene compared to more polar solvents, which is not consistent with the trend we observe with many other 2&#8208;halopyridines. We attribute this to solvent basicity hydrogen&#8208;bonding (pKHB) between solvent and substrate. Greater hydrogen&#8208;bond donation from the substrate leads to a more electron&#8208;rich aromatic system, and therefore slower oxidative addition. We demonstrate how this affects rate and site&#8208;selectivity for hydrogen&#8208;bond donating substrates. Second, electron&#8208;deficient multihalogenated pyridines exhibit improved site&#8208;selectivity in polar solvents, which we attribute to different C&#8211;X sites undergoing oxidative addition by two different mechanisms. The C&#8211;X site that favours the more polar nucleophilic displacement transition state is preferred over the site that favours a less&#8208;polar 3&#8208;centered transition state. Finally, (hetero)aryl triflates consistently undergo faster oxidative addition in more polar solvents, which we attribute to highly polar nucleophilic displacement transition states. This leads to improved site&#8208;selectivity for C&#8211;OTf oxidative addition, even in the presence of highly reactive 2&#8208;pyridylhalides.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Method to Obtain Functionalised &#951;6&#8208;Bound Arenes in Ru(II) and Os(II) Half&#8208;Sandwich Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Half&#8208;sandwich Ru(II)&#8208; and Os(II)&#8208;arene complexes have great potential for catalytic and biological applications. The possibility of fine&#8208;tuning their chemical reactivity by including modifications in the ligands around the metal adds to their many advantages. However, structural modifications at the n6&#8208;bound arene have had significant synthetic limitations, particularly in the design of Os(II)&#8208;tethered complexes. For the first time, we have employed a practical C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp2) coupling to obtain 28 new Ru(II) and Os(II) &#951;6&#8208;arene half&#8208;sandwich complexes with a wide variety of arene functionalities, including those that enable the formation of tether rings, such as quinoline and coumarin. The introduction of novel functional groups at the arene in Ru(II)&#8208; and Os(II) half&#8208;sandwich complexes can broaden the synthetic scope of this type of organometallic complexes, and help to take full advantage of their structural diversity, especially in intracellular catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>NMR screen reveals the diverse structural landscape of a G&#8208;quadruplex library</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>G&#8208;quadruplexes are noncanonical nucleic acid structures formed by stacked guanine tetrads.&#160;Despite their functional and structural diversity, a single consensus model is typically used to describe sequences with the potential to form G&#8208;quadruplex structures. We are interested in developing more specific sequence models for G&#8208;quadruplexes. In previous work, we functionally characterized each sequence in a 496&#8208;member library of variants of a monomeric reference G&#8208;quadruplex for the ability to bind GTP, promote a model peroxidase reaction, generate intrinsic fluorescence, and to form multimers. Here we used NMR to obtain a broad overview of the structural features of this library. After determining the&#160;1H NMR spectrum of each of these 496 sequences, spectra were sorted into multiple classes, most of which could be rationalized based on mutational patterns in the primary sequence. A more detailed screen using representative sequences provided additional information about spectral classes, and confirmed that the classes determined based on analysis of&#160;1H NMR spectra are correlated with functional categories identified in previous studies. These results provide new insights into the surprising structural diversity of this library. They also show how NMR can be used to identify classes of sequences with distinct mutational signatures and functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Neutral Adducts of Molybdenum Hexafluoride Structure and Bonding in MoF6(NC5H5) and MoF6(NC5H5)2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first Lewis acid base adducts of MoF6 and an organic base have been synthesized, i.e., MoF6(NC5H5) and MoF6(NC5H5)2. These adducts are structurally characterized with X&#8208;ray crystallography, showing that both adducts adopt capped trigonal prismatic structures. The MoF6(NC5H5) and MoF6(NC5H5)2 adducts are fluxional on the NMR time scale at room temperature. Two different fluorine environments could be resolved by 19F NMR spectroscopy at &#8211;80 &#176;C for the 1:2 adduct, MoF6(NC5H5)2, whereas MoF6(NC5H5) remains fluxional at that temperature. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations aide the assignment of the infrared and Raman spectra. Natural Bond Order and Molecular Electrostatic Potential analyses elucidate the structures and properties of the MoF6 pyridine adducts. Regions of significantly higher molecular electrostatic potential, i.e., &#963;&#8208;holes, in trigonal prismatic compared to octahedral MoF6 rationalize the capped trigonal prismatic geometry of the adducts. Whereas MoF6(NC5H5) is stable at room temperature under exclusion of moisture, MoF6(NC5H5)2 decomposes at 60 &#176;C in pyridine solvent, and the solid slowly decomposes at room temperature after 24 h.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Method for the Selective Synthesis of Amides and N&#8208;Acylureas from Carboxylic Acids and Thioureas</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we developed a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven method for the selective synthesis of amides and N&#8208;acylureas from carboxylic acids and thioureas. This protocol was featured as avoidance of additional oxidants and transition metal catalysts, simple manipulations, low cost, broad substrate scope, and good functional group tolerance. As only oxygen serves as the oxidation reagent, this method provides a promising synthesis candidate for the formation of N&#8208;aryl amides and N&#8208;acylureas, including late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex pharmaceutical molecules and biologically active molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Cyclic Hydrogen Bonding to Suppress Side Reactions and Dendrite Formation on Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high electrochemical reactivity of H2O molecules and zinc metal results in severe side reactions and dendrite formation on zinc anodes. Here we demonstrate that these issues can be addressed by using N&#8208;hydroxymethylacetamide (NHA) as additives in 2 M ZnSO4 electrolytes. The addition of NHA molecules, acting as both a hydrogen bond donor and acceptor, enables the formation of cyclic hydrogen bonding with H2O molecules. This interaction disrupts the existing hydrogen bonding networks between H2O molecules, hindering proton transport, and containing H2O molecules within the cyclic hydrogen bonding structure to prevent deprotonation. Additionally, NHA molecules show a preference for adsorption on the (101) crystal surface of zinc metal. This preferential adsorption reduces the surface energy of the (101) plane, facilitating the homogeneous Zn deposition along the (101) direction. Thus, the NHA enables Zn||Zn symmetric cell with a cycle lifespan of 1100 hours at 5 mA cm&#8722;2 and Zn||Cu asymmetric cell with a high Coulombic efficiency over 99.5%. Moreover, the NHA&#8208;modified Zn||AC zinc ion hybrid capacitor is capable of sustaining 15000 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1. This electrolyte additive engineering presents a promising strategy to enhance the performance and broaden the application potential of zinc metal&#8208;based energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies and Applications for Supramolecular Protein Self&#8208;assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular chemistry achieves higher&#8208;order molecular self&#8208;assembly through non&#8208;covalent interactions. Utilizing supramolecular methods to explore the polymorphism of proteins, the building blocks of life, from a "bottom&#8208;up" perspective is essential for constructing diverse and functional biomaterials. In recent years, significant progress has been achieved in the design strategies and functional applications of supramolecular protein self&#8208;assembly, becoming a focal point for researchers. This paper reviews classical supramolecular strategies driving protein self&#8208;assembly, including electrostatic interactions, metal coordination, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, host&#8208;guest interactions, and other mechanisms. We discuss how these supramolecular interactions regulate protein assembly processes and highlight protein supramolecular assemblies' unique structural and functional advantages in constructing artificial photosynthetic systems, protein hydrogels, bio&#8208;delivery systems, and other functional materials. The enormous potential and significance of supramolecular protein materials are elucidated. Finally, the challenges in preparing and applying protein supramolecular assemblies are summarized, and future development directions are projected.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold Meets Selenium: Dual Activation of Selenium&#8208;Containing Propargyl Alcohols Towards the Synthesis of 2H&#8208;Chromenes and Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of seleno&#8208;substituted chromenes from selenoalkynes and phenols. In this cascade reaction, the applied gold catalyst not only functions as a p&#8208;acid, but also as a Lewis acid, enabling the propargylic substitution in the first step to connect the oxygen carbon bond. Under the optimal reaction condition a total of 26 chromenes were accessible by this modular access. During scale up experiments, the hydrolysis of the vinylselenium substructure to the corresponding chromenones was observed. By revisiting the electron&#8208;rich starting materials, four chromenones were produced following a one&#8208;pot reaction using a single gold catalyst. To better understand the interaction of gold and selenium, a series of nuclear magnetic resonance studies and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry studies were performed, which led to the proposal of a mechanism for this transformation</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Basal and Prismatic Planes of Graphitic Materials for Metal Single Atom and Subnanometer Cluster Stabilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The detection of small quantities of metal clusters in single atom catalysts remains a challenge even when combining electron microscopy (EM), X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results obtained demonstrate that Rh single atoms are mainly present on materials presenting prismatic surface, and that catalysis itself constitutes a valuable tool for the characterization of these materials.







Abstract
Supported metal single atom catalysis is a dynamic research area in catalysis science combining the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. Understanding the interactions between metal single atoms and the support constitutes a challenge facing the development of such catalysts, since these interactions are essential in optimizing the catalytic performance. For conventional carbon supports, two types of surfaces can contribute to single atom stabilization: the basal planes and the prismatic surface; both of which can be decorated by defects and surface oxygen groups. To date, most studies on carbon&#8208;supported single atom catalysts focused on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons, which, unlike classic carbon materials, have a fairly well&#8208;defined chemical environment. Herein we report the synthesis, characterization and modeling of rhodium single atom catalysts supported on carbon materials presenting distinct concentrations of surface oxygen groups and basal/prismatic surface area. The influence of these parameters on the speciation of the Rh species, their coordination and ultimately on their catalytic performance in hydrogenation and hydroformylation reactions is analyzed. The results obtained show that catalysis itself is an interesting tool for the fine characterization of these materials, for which the detection of small quantities of metal clusters remains a challenge, even when combining several cutting&#8208;edge analytical methods.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report that excellent porous carbon materials are obtained by modulating different proportions of coal tar pitch and nano&#8208;calcium carbonate powder (CTP&#8722;X). CTP&#8208;2 exhibits excellent cycling and multiplication performance when used as an anode for LIBs, and is expected to be used as an electrode material for the next generation LIBs.







Abstract
Because of its high specific capacity and superior rate performance, porous carbon is regarded as a potential anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, porous carbon materials with wide pore diameter distributions suffer from low structural stability and low electrical conductivity during the application process. During this study, the calcium carbonate nanoparticle template method is used to prepare coal tar pitch&#8208;derived porous carbon (CTP&#8722;X). The coal tar pitch&#8208;derived porous carbon has a well&#8208;developed macroporous&#8208;mesoporous&#8208;microporous hierarchical porous network structure, which provides abundant active sites for Li+ storage, significantly reduces polarization and charge transfer resistance, shortens the diffusion path and promotes the rapid transport of Li+. More specifically, the CTP&#8208;2 anode shows high charge capacity (496.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1), excellent rate performance (413.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1), and high cycling stability (capacity retention rate of about 100&#8201;% after 1,000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). The clean and eco&#8208;friendly large&#8208;scale utilization of coal tar pitch will facilitate the development of high&#8208;performance anodes in the field of LIBs.

         <title>Active Site Environment and Reactivity of Copper&#8208;A&#946; in Membrane Mimetic SDS Micellar Environment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper interacts with A&#946; peptides in membrane&#8208;mimicking SDS micellar environments, forming Cu&#8208;A&#946; complexes that induce higher hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Moreover, we observe an increased oxidation rate of neurotransmitter such as dopamine in the presence of H2O2 by Cu&#8208;A&#946; complexes.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the abnormal aggregation of amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) peptide in extracellular deposits generated upon proteolysis of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP). While copper (Cu(II)) binds to A&#946; in soluble oligomeric and aggregated forms, its interaction with membrane&#8208;bound A&#946; remains elusive. Investigating these interactions is crucial for understanding AD pathogenesis. Here, utilizing SDS micelles as a simplified membrane mimic, we focus on elucidating the interplay between membrane&#8208;anchored A&#946; and copper, given their pivotal roles in AD. We employed spectroscopic techniques including UV, CD, and EPR to characterize the active site of Cu&#8208;A&#946; complexes. Our findings demonstrate that copper interacts with A&#946; peptides in membrane&#8208;mimicking micellar environments similarly to aqueous buffer solutions. Cu&#8208;A&#946; complexes in this medium also induce higher hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, potentially contributing to AD&#8208;related oxidative stress. Moreover, we observe an increased oxidation rate of neurotransmitter such as dopamine by Cu&#8208;A&#946; complexes. These results enhance our understanding of Cu&#8208;A&#946; interactions in AD pathology and offer insights into potential therapeutic interventions targeting this interaction.

         <title>Thiolated Cyanines Appended to Partially Pegylated Gold Nanoparticles for Fluorescence Quenching of Two&#8208;Channel Photothermal Inks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyanine dyes equipped with a thiolated bridge are non&#8208;fluorescent when grafted on partially&#8208;pegilated Au nanoparticles. The cyanine/AuNP pegilated hybrids can be dissolved in water/alcohol mixtures to give nanoinks, whose printouts display two photothermally responsive absorption bands, that give different T increases when laser&#8208;irradiated.







Abstract
Following a new approach, we prepared a nanoink with two separate photothermally responsive absorption bands. One is the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) absorption of gold nanoparticles (AuNP, d=17&#8197;nm), the second is the absorption band of two cyanine (Cy) dyes, Cy7&#8208;C6 or Cy7&#8208;C11, grafted to the AuNP surface through thiolated bridges of different lengths: the close proximity to the Au surface induces full quenching of the Cy fluorescence, resulting in thermal relaxation on irradiation. Attempts to full coat AuNP with the lipophilic Cy7&#8208;C6 and Cy7&#8208;C11 lead to precipitation from aqueous solutions. We thus prepared AuNP with partial pegylation (30, 50, or 70&#8201;%), using a long chain thiol&#8208;terminated PEG bearing a &#8208;COOH function. Addition until saturation of either Cy7&#8208;C6 or Cy7&#8208;C11 to the partially pegylated AuNP gave the AuNP@Cy/PEGX% hybrids (X=30, 50, 70) that are stable in water and in the water/alcohol mixtures used to prepare the nanoinks. Further overcoating of AuNP@Cy7&#8208;C6/PEG50&#8201;% with PAH (polyallylamine hydrochloride) avoids LSPR hybridization in the dry nanoink printouts, that present two separate bands. When irradiated with laser sources near their absorption maxima, the printouts of the AuNP@Cy7&#8208;C6/PEG50&#8201;%@PAH nanoink respond on two channels, giving different temperature increases depending on the irradiation wavelengths. This enhances the potentiality of use of these nanoinks for photothermal anticounterfait printouts, making more difficult to reproduce the correct &#916;T vs &#955;irradiation output.

         <title>A Novel Fluorescent Gemcitabine Prodrug That Follows a Nucleoside Transporter&#8208;Independent Internalization and Bears Enhanced Therapeutic Efficacy With Respect to Gemcitabine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescent prodrug, named GF, based on gemcitabine and 5(6)&#8208;carboxyfluorescein was developed in a single step. GF follows a nucleoside transporter&#8208;independent endocytosis internalization mechanism, surpassing a key resistance mechanism against gemcitabine. Its pharmacokinetic profile and drug release efficiency were evaluated in mice, and eventually its visualization was achieved in zebrafish and its tumor inhibition was monitored in A549 xenografted mice.







Abstract
The multiplexity of cancer has rendered it the second leading cause of mortality worldwide and theragnostic prodrugs have gained popularity in recent years as a means of treatment. Theragnostic prodrugs enable the simultaneous diagnosis and therapy of tumors via high&#8208;precision real&#8208;time drug release monitoring. Herein, we report the development of the small theragnostic prodrug GF, based on the nucleoside anticancer agent gemcitabine and the fluorescent dye 5(6)&#8208;carboxyfluorescein. We have successfully demonstrated its efficient internalization in tumor cells, showing localization throughout both the early and late endocytic pathways. Its mechanism of cell internalization was evaluated, confirming its independence from nucleoside transporters. Its cellular localization via confocal microscopy revealed a clathrin&#8208;mediated endocytosis mechanism, distinguishing it from analogous compounds studied previously. Furthermore, GF exhibited stability across various pH values and in human blood plasma. Subsequently, its in&#8197;vitro cytotoxicity was assessed in three human cancer cell lines (A549, U87 and T98). Additionally, its pharmacokinetic profile in mice was investigated and the consequent drug release was monitored. Finally, its in&#8197;vivo visualization was accomplished in zebrafish xenotransplantation models and its in&#8197;vivo efficacy was evaluated in A549 xenografts. The results unveiled an intriguing efficacy profile, positioning GF as a compelling candidate warranting further investigation.

         <title>Contact Electrification as an Emerging Strategy for Controlling the Performance of Metal Nanoparticle Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As modern technology enters the era of nanomaterials, the contact electrification, as a classic physical phenomenon, brings new ideas for studying the interactions between metal nanoparticles. The study of contact electrification phenomenon by classical theory shows that the Fermi level of materials before and after contact changes. This conclusion is further confirmed by modern characterization techniques, and this change in the Fermi level of materials is reflected in the field of catalysis, which can regulate the performance of catalysts in catalytic reactions.







Abstract
Contact electrification (CE) is an emerging strategy for controlling the performance of metal nanoparticle (NP) catalysts.

     alt="Contact Electrification as an Emerging Strategy for Controlling the Performance of Metal Nanoparticle Catalysts"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As modern technology enters the era of nanomaterials, the contact electrification, as a classic physical phenomenon, brings new ideas for studying the interactions between metal nanoparticles. The study of contact electrification phenomenon by classical theory shows that the Fermi level of materials before and after contact changes. This conclusion is further confirmed by modern characterization techniques, and this change in the Fermi level of materials is reflected in the field of catalysis, which can regulate the performance of catalysts in catalytic reactions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contact electrification (CE) is an emerging strategy for controlling the performance of metal nanoparticle (NP) catalysts. The underlying physical principle of this control is the sensitivity of the Fermi level to metal-metal contacts. This change in electronic structure has a direct impact on surface properties and chemical reactivity. The concept article briefly introduces the basic theory of CE and its relationship to catalytic performance. We then highlight selected recent examples of advances in the preparation of hybrid metal NP assemblies, experimental techniques for characterizing CE, and finally applications of CE for altering catalytic performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This report presents an environmentally benign synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazines through an iodide&#8208;catalyzed electro&#8208;oxidative skeletal editing of 3&#8208;aminoindazoles. The method uses electrochemically generated reactive iodide species without involving any transition metal catalysts and peroxides. This mild reaction protocol exhibits a wide substrate scope with brad synthetic applicability. Detailed mechanistic studies elucidate a N&#8208;centered [1,2]&#8208;rearrangement as the key reaction step.







Abstract
This report describes an environmentally benign synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazines through an iodide&#8208;catalyzed electro&#8208;oxidative N&#8208;centered [1,2]&#8208;rearrangement of 3&#8208;aminoindazoles. The developed method demonstrates the activation of heteroatoms via electrochemically generated reactive iodide species without using any metal catalysts and peroxides. The protocol features practical and mild reaction conditions and displays a wide substrate scope. Various mechanistic experiments and cyclic voltammetric studies have been instrumental in elucidating the reaction mechanism, operating via a skeletal rearrangement of 3&#8208;aminoindazoles.

         <title>Gold Nanoclusters Whose Photoluminescent Properties are Dynamically Tunable by Modulating the Assembly Pathway Complexity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Gold nanoclusters (DPT&#8208;AuNCs) could self&#8208;assembles into two distinct aggregation structures in MeOH/water mixed solvent, exhibiting pathway complexity with different photoluminescent property. DPT&#8208;AuNCs firstly assembles into non&#8208;luminescent nanofibers (kinetically controlled), which further transforms into strongly luminescent microflowers (thermodynamically controlled).







Abstract
Modulating the assembly pathway is an indispensable strategy for optimizing the performance of optical materials. However, implementing this strategy is nontrivial for metal nanocluster building blocks, due to the limited functional modification of nanoclusters and complexity of their emission mechanism. In this report, we demonstrate that a gold nanocluster modified by 4,6&#8208;diamino&#8208;2&#8208;pyrimidinethiol (DPT&#8208;AuNCs) self&#8208;assembles into two distinct aggregation structures in methanol (MeOH)/water mixed solvent, thus exhibiting pathway complexity. Kinetic studies show that DPT&#8208;AuNCs firstly assembles into non&#8208;luminescent nanofibers (kinetically controlled), which further transforms into strongly luminescent microflowers (thermodynamically controlled). In&#8208;depth analysis of the assembly mechanism reveals that the transformation of aggregation structures involves the disassembly of nanofibers and a subsequent nucleation&#8208;growth process. Temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and infrared (IR) measurements reveal that inter&#8208;cluster hydrogen bonding bridged by solvent molecules and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction are the key factors for emission enhancement. The photoluminescent property of DPT&#8208;AuNCs can be controlled by varying the cosolvent in water, enabling DPT&#8208;AuNCs to distinguish different kind of alcohols, particularly the isomerism n&#8208;propanol (NPA) and isopropanol (IPA). Additionally, the addition of seeds effectively regulate the assembly kinetics of DPT&#8208;AuNCs. This study advances our understanding of assembly pathways and improves the luminescent performance of nanoclusters (NCs).

         <title>Searching for &#8220;Greener&#8221; Bioequivalents of CF3 to Lower its Environmental Impact</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Considering concerns on the negative environmental effects of CF3 containing compounds, we searched for &#8220;greener&#8221; alternatives. We found &#8722;I as the best alternative since it is equivalent in all aspects studied, size, electronic and lipophilic, followed by &#8722;F, &#8208;cyclo&#8208;Pr, &#8722;2&#8208;oxetyl, &#8722;SF5 and &#8722;SCH3. We suggest using these functionalities as an alternative to &#8722;CF3 in the preparation of new therapies.







Abstract
Considering the broad use of the trifluoromethyl functional group (&#8722;CF3) in medicinal chemistry and taking into account the recent concerns on the negative environmental effects of CF3 containing compounds, we are searching for &#8220;greener&#8221; alternatives. Thus, different chemical groups (i.&#8201;e. iodide, fluoride, cyclopropyl, isopropyl, cyclobutyl, 3&#8208;oxetyl, 2&#8208;oxetyl, methylsulfide, pentafluorosulfide, methylsulfonyl and sulfonamide) have been considered as potential bioequivalents of &#8722;CF3 aiming to use them in compounds with therapeutic interest instead of the polyfluoride functionality. Different structural (molecular surface and volume) and physicochemical (electronic and lipophilic) aspects of the bioequivalent functionalities proposed have been theoretically calculated and compared to those of &#8722;CF3. Additionally, the corresponding phenyl derivatives carrying these functionalities have been purchased or prepared and their experimental lipophilicity (i.&#8201;e. LogP) measured using shake&#8208;flask experiments and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy.

         <title>Stereochemically Active Lone Pairs Stabilizing Intrinsic Vacancy Defects in Thermoelectric InTe</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoelectric InTe exhibits significant structural disorder in the form of In+ vacancies. Using 3D&#8208;&#916;PDF informed Monte&#8208;Carlo simulations we reveal the local structure associated with these defects. This structure allows the local expression of stereochemically active lone pairs with an associated electronic energy gain, which is proposed to be a driving force for the formation of the intrinsic vacancy defects.







Abstract
Harvesting waste heat efficiently with thermoelectric energy conversion requires materials with low thermal conductivity. Recently, it was demonstrated how dynamic lone pair expression in thermoelectric InTe is responsible for giant anharmonicity leading to a very low lattice thermal conductivity. InTe also contains correlated disorder of intrinsic defects due to vacancies, and this contributes to additional lowering of the thermal conductivity. Here we use the three&#8208;dimensional difference pair distribution function (3D&#8208;&#916;PDF) to analyze 25&#8197;K single crystal diffuse X&#8208;ray scattering from InTe to unravel the local defect structure, and propose a microscopic structural model. Extended off&#8208;centering of In+ ions induced by vacancies allows for the local expression of stereochemically active lone pairs. The associated electronic stabilization is proposed to be a driving force for the formation of In+ vacancy defects in InTe.

         <title>Electrochemical Decarboxylative Cross&#8208;Coupling with Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct electrochemical decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling with nucleophiles has been developed for the synthesis of structurally diverse fluoride, alcohol, ether, ester, and amine products. This strategy takes advantage of the ready availability of these building blocks from commercial libraries, as well as the mild and oxidant&#8208;free conditions provided by the electrochemical system.







Abstract
Decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reactions are powerful tools for carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds formation, but typically require pre&#8208;activated carboxylic acids as substrates or heteroelectrophiles as functional groups. Herein, we present an electrochemical decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling of carboxylic acids with structurally diverse fluorine, alcohol, H2O, acid, and amine as nucleophiles. This strategy takes advantage of the ready availability of these building blocks from commercial libraries, as well as the mild and oxidant&#8208;free conditions provided by electrochemical system. This reaction demonstrates good functional&#8208;group tolerance and its utility in late&#8208;stage functionalization.

&lt;p&gt;Direct electrochemical decarboxylative cross-coupling with nucleophiles has been developed for the synthesis of structurally diverse fluoride, alcohol, ether, ester, and amine products. This strategy takes advantage of the ready availability of these building blocks from commercial libraries, as well as the mild and oxidant-free conditions provided by the electrochemical system.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decarboxylative cross-coupling reactions are powerful tools for carbon-heteroatom bonds formation, but typically require pre-activated carboxylic acids as substrates or heteroelectrophiles as functional groups. Herein, we present an electrochemical decarboxylative cross-coupling of carboxylic acids with structurally diverse fluorine, alcohol, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, acid, and amine as nucleophiles. This strategy takes advantage of the ready availability of these building blocks from commercial libraries, as well as the mild and oxidant-free conditions provided by electrochemical system. This reaction demonstrates good functional-group tolerance and its utility in late-stage functionalization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Hybridization of Polymers with Metal Oxide Clusters for the Design of Non&#8208;Fluorinated Proton Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cost&#8208;effective composite non&#8208;fluorinated proton exchange membranes (PEMs) with excellent overall performance are essential to realize the economical and efficient fabrication of fuel cells. Herein, we briefly discuss on design strategy, research progress, and application prospects of PEMs based on the polymer composites of nanoscale metal oxide clusters.







Abstract
As the key component of various energy storage and conversion devices, proton exchange membranes (PEMs) have been attracting significant interest. However, their further development is limited by the high cost of perfluorosulfonic acid polymers and the poor stability of acid&#8208;dopped non&#8208;fluorinated polymers. Recently, a new group of PEMs has been developed by hybridizing polyoxometalates (POMs), a group of super acidic sub&#8208;nanoscale metal oxide clusters, with polymers. POMs can serve simultaneously as both proton sponges and stabilizing agents, and their complexation with polymers can further improve polymers&#8217; mechanical performance and processability. Enormous efforts have been focused on studying supramolecular complexation or covalent grafting of POMs with various polymers to optimize PEMs in terms of cost, mechanical properties and stabilities. This concept summarizes recent advances in this emerging field and outlines the design strategies and application perspectives employed for using POM&#8208;polymer hybrid materials as PEMs.

Cp&#8722;M&#8722;M&#8242;&#8208;Nacnac complexes (M=Be, Mg, Ca, Zn, Cd, Hg) are predicted to exhibit electron&#8208;sharing covalent metal&#8208;metal bonds with a [MM&#8242;]2+ core. QTAIM predicts non&#8208;nuclear attractors (NNAs) with substantial electron density in the BeBe, MgMg, and CaCa complexes, suggesting that these metal&#8208;metal bonds also retain significant metallic character that can be associated with reducing reactivity.

Abstract
Bimetallic CpMM'Nacnac molecules with group 2 and 12 metals (M=Be, Mg, Ca, Zn, Cd, Hg) that contain novel metal&#8208;metal bonding have been investigated in a theoretical study of their molecular and electronic structure, thermodynamic stability, and metal&#8208;metal bonding. In all cases the metal&#8208;metal bonds are characterized as electron&#8208;sharing covalent single bonds from natural bond orbital (NBO) and energy&#8208;decomposition analysis with natural orbitals of chemical valence (EDA&#8208;NOCV) analysis. The sum of [MM&#8242;] charges is relatively constant, with all complexes exhibiting a [MM&#8242;]2+ core. Quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analysis indicates the presence of non&#8208;nuclear attractors (NNA) in the metal&#8208;metal bonds of the BeBe, MgMg, and CaCa complexes. There is substantial electron density (0.75&#8211;1.33&#8197;e) associated with the NNAs, which indicates that these metal&#8208;metal bonds, while classified as covalent electron&#8208;sharing bonds, retain significant metallic character that can be associated with reducing reactivity of the complex. The predicted stability of these complexes, combined with their novel covalent metal&#8208;metal bonding and potential as reducing agents, make them appealing targets for the synthesis of new metal&#8208;metal bonds.

         <title>Narrowband Blue Circularly Polarized Luminescence Emitter Based on BN&#8208;Doped Benzo[6]helicene with Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two 1,4&#8208;azaborinine [6]helicenes, H[6]BN1 and H[6]BN2, exhibit blue fluorescence with narrow FWHMs below 31&#8197;nm and high PLQY up to 92&#8201;%. Desirable circularly polarized luminescence with glum reaching 4~5&#215;10&#8722;4 and good configurational stability are relized for H[6]BN1 and H[6]BN2. Mechanochromism occurs between H[6]BN1&#8242;s crystalline and amorphous states by modulationg &#960;&#8208;&#960; intermolecular interanctions. An turquoise OLED based H[6]BN1 is manufactured with the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 3.18&#8201;%.







Abstract
Boron&#8208;doped helicenes, known for their unique electronic and photophysical properties, are of great interest for numerous applications. This research introduces two new azabora[6]helicenes, H[6]BN1 and H[6]BN2, synthesized through an efficient method. These molecules have boron and nitrogen atoms in opposing positions, enhancing their distinctive attributes. Both helicenes show excellent emission properties, with H[6]BN1 and H[6]BN2 exhibiting narrowband blue fluorescence and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), achieving glum values of 4~5&#215;10&#8722;4 which is beneficial for chiroptical applications. The addition of a donor group, 3, 6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole, in H[6]BN2 improves luminescence, likely due to enhanced molecular orbital overlap and electron delocalization. H[6]BN1&#8242;s needle&#8208;like single crystals exhibit mechanochromism, changing luminescent color from yellow to green under mechanical stress, which is promising for stimulus&#8208;responsive materials. In conclusion, this study presents a novel class of BN[6]helicenes with superior chiroptical properties. Their combination of electronic features and mechanochromism makes them ideal for advanced chiroptical materials, expanding the potential of helicene&#8208;based compounds and offering new directions for the synthesis of molecules with specific chiroptical characteristics.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Cross&#8208;Plane Conductance of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cross&#8208;plane break junction (XPBJ) measurement results of pyrene derivatives confirm that hydrogenation reduces conductance, while conductance of pyrene derivatives increased after substitution by both electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. It is found that only the trend of decreasing conductance for hydro&#8208;pyrene was consistent with the change in aromaticity.







Abstract
In the cross&#8208;plane single&#8208;molecule junctions, the correlation between molecular aromaticity and conductance remained puzzling. Cross&#8208;plane break junction (XPBJ) provides new insight into understanding the role of aromaticity and conjugation to molecules on charge transport through the planar molecules. In this work, we investigated the modulation of cross&#8208;plane charge transport in pyrene derivatives by hydrogenation and substituents based on the XPBJ method that differs from those used in&#8208;plane transport. We measured the electrical conductance of the hydrogenated derivatives of the pyrenes and found that hydrogenation reduces conductance, and the fully hydrogenated molecule has the lowest conductance. Conductance of pyrene derivatives increased after substitution by both electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. By calculating, the trend in decreased conductance of hydrogenated pyrene was found to be consistent with the change in aromaticity. Electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents reduce the aromaticity of the molecule and narrow the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap, while electron&#8208;donating groups increase the aromaticity but also narrow the gap. Our work reveals the potential of fine&#8208;tuning the structure of the pyrene molecule to control the cross&#8208;plane charge transport through the single&#8208;molecule junctions.

         <title>Consequences of the Pb&#8208;S bond formation for lead halide perovskites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lead halide perovskites are structurally not stable due to their ionic bonds. Using sulfur agents in the crystal growth improves the stability and performance of the photovoltaic and light&#8208;emitting devices. In this theoretical work, we use a small toy S&#8208;radical in place of A cation in the bulk of lead iodide perovskite, and highlight the significance of the Pb&#8208;S covalent&#8208;double&#8208;bond formation for: the charge redistribution on the neighboring bonds that also turn to be covalent, phase transformation to a stable non&#8208;perovskite structure, and superior optoelectronic properties. The chemical analysis was performed with the Quantum Theory of Atoms In Molecules (QTAIM) and Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions (NCI) index. Excitonic properties were obtained from the solution of ab initio Bethe&#8208;Salpeter equation. Presence of the spin&#8208;orbit coupling triggers an interplay between the Frenkel and charge&#8208;transfer multiexcitons, switching between the photovoltaic and laser applications. Multiexcitons obey the exciton&#8208;fission preconditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme Fueled Dissipative Self&#8208;assembly of Guanine Functionalized Molecules and Their Cellular Behaviour</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Generally, an esterase lipase enzyme can hydrolyze specific substrates called esters in an aqueous solution. Herein, we investigate how a G&#8208;quadruplex self&#8208;assembly affects the hydrolysis equilibrium in reverse. The biocatalyst, lipase, activates the individual building&#8208;blocks through fuel consumption, causing them to undergo a higher degree of self&#8208;organization into nanofibers within spheres. We have synthesized five peptide&#8208;lipid&#8208;conjugated guanine base functionalized molecules to explore how the equilibrium can be shifted through reverse hydrolysis. Among these, NAC5 self&#8208;assembled into a G&#8208;quadruplex structure which has been confirmed by various spectroscopic techniques. The wide&#8208;angle powder XRD, ThT dye binding assay and circular dichroism study is carried out to support the presence of the G&#8208;quadruplex structure. The biocatalytic formation of nanofibers enclosed spheres is analyzed using CLSM, FE&#8208;SEM and HR&#8208;TEM experiments. Additionally, we assess the biocompatibility of the enzyme fueled dissipative self&#8208;assembled fibers enclosed spheres, as they have potential applications as a biomaterial in protocells. MTT assay is performed to check the cytotoxicity of G&#8208;quadruplex hydrogel, using HEK 293 and McCoy cell lines for viability assessment. Finally, the utility of the novel NAC5 hydrogel as a wound repairing biomaterial is demonstrated by cell migration experiment in a scratch assay.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;medical applications of inorganic medicines. A switch based on mechanistic knowledge</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metals have been used in medicine for centuries. However, it was not until much later that the effects of inorganic drugs could be rationalized from a mechanistic point of view. Today, thanks to the technologies available, this approach has been functionally developed and implemented. It has been found that there is probably no single biological target for the pharmacological effects of most inorganic drugs. Herein, we present an overview of some integrated and multi&#8208;technique approaches to elucidate the molecular interactions underlying the biological effects of metallodrugs. On this premise, selected examples are used to illustrate how the information obtained on metal&#8208;based drugs and their respective mechanisms can become relevant for applications in fields other than medicine. For example, some well&#8208;known metallodrugs, which have been shown to bind specific amino acid residues of proteins, can be used to solve problems related to protein structure elucidation in crystallographic studies. Diruthenium tetraacetate can be used to catalyze the conversion of hydroxylamines to nitrones with a high selectivity when bound to lysozyme. Finally, a case study is presented in which an unprecedented palladium/arsenic&#8208;mediated catalytic cycle for nitrile hydration was discovered thanks to previous studies on the solution chemistry of the anticancer compound arsenoplatin&#8208;1 (AP&#8208;1).</dc:description>

         <title>A Computational Study of Reactions with Boric Acid Aimed to Promote the Utilization of Lignin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For exploring the reaction between the hydroxyl groups of lignin and boric acid under the alkaline condition, we study three proposed mechanisms for the formation of the anionic borate diester (ABDE) using the salicyl alcohol anion as the model compound by the density functional theory. ABDE has high flame retardancy and is a potentially practical application of lignin. The catalysis of sodium cation is found to enhance the deprotonation of the water cluster. The deprotonated product, hydroxide anion, is essential to the critical step, which is the cleavage of B&#8722;O bonds of the boric acid molecule, in reaction mechanisms. The energy profiles of the mechanisms show that the reaction between lignin and boric acid may start from the hydroxymethyl moieties of lignin since it requires less energy for the aforementioned critical step than from the phenol moieties of lignin. Moreover, the hydroxide anions compete with the hydroxymethyl groups in lignin for the formation of B&#8722;O bonds by forming tetrahydroxyborate anion (TBA) which requires very high activation energies to further react to the desired product ABDE. The optimal condition is to enhance the catalytic effect of sodium cations and meanwhile to control the formation of TBA.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzo&#8208;fused BOPAM Fluorophores: Synthesis, Post&#8208;functionalization, Photophysical Properties, and Acid Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel category of asymmetric boron chromophores with the attachment of two BF2 moieties denoted as BOPAM, has been successfully synthesized via a one&#8208;pot three&#8208;step reaction starting from N&#8208;phenylbenzothioamide. This synthetic route results in the production of [a] and [b]benzo&#8208;fused BOPAMs along with post&#8208;functionalization of the [a]benzo&#8208;fused BOPAMs. The photophysical properties of these compounds have been systematically investigated through steady&#8208;state absorption and fluorescence emission measurements in solvents at both ambient and cryogenic temperatures, as well as in the solid state. Computational methods have been employed to elucidate the emissive characteristics of the benzo&#8208;fused BOPAMs, revealing distinctive photophysical attributes, including solvent&#8208;dependent fluorescence intensity. Remarkably, certain BOPAM derivatives exhibit noteworthy photophysical phenomena, such as the induction of off&#8208;on fluorescence emission under specific solvent conditions and the manifestation of intermolecular charge transfer states in solid&#8208;state matrices. Through post&#8208;functionalization strategies involving the introduction of electron&#8208;donating groups onto the [a]benzo&#8208;fused BOPAM scaffold, an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) pathway is activated, leading to substantial fluorescence quenching via non&#8208;radiative decay processes. Notably, one [a]benzo&#8208;fused BOPAM variant exhibits a pronounced fluorescence enhancement upon exposure to acidic conditions, thereby underscoring its potential utility in pH&#8208;sensing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>LOW&#8208;TEMPERATURE SYNTHESIS OF GeTe NANOPARTICLES</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoparticles can offer an alternative approach to fabricate phase&#8208;change materials. The chemical synthesis of GeTe nanoparticles using organometallic precursors exploits high&#8208;boiling solvents and relatively high temperatures (close or even above crystallization temperatures), as reported in the available literature. The aim of this work is the preparation of GeTe nanoparticles by a low&#8208;temperature synthetic method exploiting new organometallic precursors and common organic solvents. Indeed, different preparation methods and characterization of GeTe nanoparticles is discussed. The characterization of the prepared nanomaterial was performed on the basis of X&#8208;ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, laser ablation time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry, Raman scattering spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering. The results show that the low&#8208;temperature synthetic route leads to amorphous GeTe nanoparticles. Exploited organometallic precursor is stabilised by neutral ligand which can be isolated after the reaction and repeatedly used for further reactions. Furthermore, GeTe nanoparticle size can be tuned by the conditions of the synthesis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>accurately synthesizing coordination&#8208;driven metal&#8208;organic cages with customized shape and cavity remain a great challenge for chemists. In this work, a bottom&#8208;up step&#8208;wise coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly approach was put forward. Employing this strategy, three terpyridyl heterometallic&#8208;organic truncated tetrahedral cages with different sizes and cavity were precisely synthesized. Firstly, the coordination of tripodal organic ligands with Ru2+ afforded dendritic metal&#8208;organic ligands L1&#8208;L3. Then the Ru building blocks complexed with Fe2+ and shrunk to form the desired heterometallic&#8208;organic cages (C1&#8208;C3). These discrete heterometallic&#8208;organic supramolecular cages were fully characterized and displayed the large and open cavities varied from 7205 &#197;3 to 9384 &#197;3. Notably, these cages&#160;could not be directly constructed by single&#8208;step assembly process using initial organic ligands or dimeric metal&#8208;organic ligands, indicative of the irreplaceability of a bottom&#8208;up step&#8208;wise assembly strategy for size&#8208;customized architectures. This work paves a new way for precisely constructing metal&#8208;organic cages with well&#8208;defined cavities.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystallography reveals metal&#8208;triggered restructuring of &#946;&#8208;hairpins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal binding to &#946;&#8208;sheets occurs in many metalloproteins and is also implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. De novo designed metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;sheets have been pursued as models and mimics of these proteins. However, no crystal structures of canonical &#946;&#8208;sheet metallopeptides have yet been obtained, in stark contrast to many examples for &#593;&#8208;helical metallopeptides, leading to a poor understanding for their chemistry. To address this, we have engineered tryptophan zippers, stable 12&#8208;residue &#946;&#8208;sheet peptides, to bind Cu(II) ions and obtained crystal structures through single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD). We find that metal binding triggers several unexpected supramolecular assemblies that demonstrate the range of higher&#8208;order structures available to metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;sheets. Overall, these findings underscore the importance of crystallography in elucidating the rich structural landscape of metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;sheet peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Molecular Scalpel for Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Nanosheet: Design Strategies and Recent Progress</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;organic nanosheets (MONs) have attracted continued attention in the field of advanced functional materials. Their nanoscale thickness, high surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, and abundant accessible active sites, are superior advantages compared with their 3D bulk counterparts. Bioinspired molecular scalpel strategy is a promising method for the creation of 2D MONs, and may solve the current shortcomings of MONs synthesis. This review aims to provide a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art overview of molecular scalpel strategies and share the results of current development to provide a better solution for MONs synthesis. Different types of molecular scalpel strategies have been systematically summarized. Both mechanisms, advantages and limitations of multiform molecular scalpel strategies have been discussed. Besides, the challenges to be overcome and the question to be solved are also introduced.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast and Efficient sensing of Drugs in Water Using Self&#8208;Assembling D&#8208;Glucamine functionalized Naphthalenediimide and 1,8&#8208;Naphthalimide Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fast and sensitive quantification of drugs as emerging pollutants in water bodies is a pressing need in contemporary society, to prevent serious environmental concerns that could negatively impact on human health. This explains the surge of interest in this field, and the need to identify highly selective sensing systems. Addressing this issue, in this work we synthesized two D&#8208;glucamine functionalized fluorophores bearing self&#8208;assembling cores, as 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide and naphthalene diimide. We studied their self&#8208;assembly in water solution, and characterized the aggregated formed by determining their stability constant, their morphology and size by scanning electron microscopy, resonance light scattering and dynamic light scattering, as well their solid&#8208;state emission ability. Then, we studied their sensing ability, in water, towards pharmaceutically active compounds such as ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, carbamazepine and diclofenac sodium salt, by fluorescence investigation. Data collected show that the self&#8208;assembling ability is significantly affected by the fluorophore structure, which in turn also determines sensing ability. In particular, the naphtalene diimide&#8208;based probe was the most sensitive, with LOD as low as 0.01 mM in the presence of nalidixic acid, which is in line and competitive with more complex sensing systems, recently reported in the literature.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Geometry Enhancing the Intersystem Crossing and Photosensitive Efficiency of Spiro Organoboron Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Based on the reported spiro organoboron compounds (PS1 and PS2 as potent 1O2 sensitizers), several new organoboron molecules (PS4&#8722;PS9) were constructed through structural modification, and their low&#8208;lying excited states and photophysical properties have been explored by density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations. The predicted effective intersystem crossing (ISC) processes arise from the S1&#8594;T2 transition for PS4&#8722;PS6 and the S1&#8594;T4 transition for PS1, and corresponding KISC rate constants reach the order of magnitude of 109 (s&#8208;1). The organoboron compounds with a (N, N) chelate acceptor are predicted to exhibit relatively higher ISC efficiency than those bearing a (N, O) acceptor, and the planar C3NBN ring and the orthogonal configuration between the donor and acceptor moieties are responsible for the ISC rate enhancement. Importantly, the geometric features of the lowest singlet excited state (S1) for these compounds play a decisive role in their photosensitive efficiency. The present results provide a basis for better understanding of the photosensitivity of these spiro organoboron compounds and the structural modification effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure Elucidation of Pharmaceutically Relevant Compounds within Pyrene&#8208;based Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) is the preferred and most accurate technique for determining molecular structures. However, it can present challenges when dealing with specific small molecules and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), as many do not form quality crystals without coformers or can be unstable. In this study, we introduce tetrakis(guanidinium) pyrenetetrasulfonate (G4PYR), a robust guanidinium&#8208;organosulfonate (GS) framework that efficiently encapsulates small molecules and APIs rich in functional groups. The hydrogen bonding frameworks formed by G4PYR display well&#8208;ordered structures with predictable pyrene&#8208;pyrene distances, making them ideally suited for targeting arene&#8208;based APIs with pendant groups. Successful encapsulation of various guests, including benzaldehyde, benzamide, and arenes containing multiple hydrogen bond donors and acceptors like uracil and thymine, was achieved. Furthermore, we successfully encapsulated important pharmaceutical and biologically relevant compounds, such as lidocaine, ropinirole, adenosine, thymidine, and others. Notably, we present a workflow for investigating host&#8208;guest complex formation using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and high throughput experimentation.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation and Electrochemical Applications of Magn&#233;li Phase Titanium Suboxides: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magn&#233;li phase titanium suboxides (M&#8208;TSOs) belong to a type of sub&#8208;stoichiometric titanium oxides based on the crystal structure of rutile TiO2. They possess a unique shear structure, granting them exceptional electrical conductivity and corrosion resistance. These two advantages are crucial for electrode materials in electrochemistry, hence the significant interest from numerous researchers. However, the preparation of M&#8208;TSOs is uneconomic due to high temperature reduction and other complex synthesis process, thus limiting their practical application in electrochemical fields. This review delves into the crystal structure, properties, and synthesis methods of M&#8208;TSOs, and touches on their applications as electrocatalysts in wastewater treatment and electrochemical water splitting. Furthermore, it highlights the research challenges and potential future research directions in M&#8208;TSOs.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantum Information Patterns Between Atoms in a Molecule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantum information theory provides a powerful toolbox of descriptors that characterize many&#8208;electron systems based on quantum information patterns between open quantum systems. Despite the wealth of insights gained in the con&#8208; densed matter community, the use of these descriptors to study interactions between atoms in a molecule remains limited. In this study, we develop a quantum information framework for molecules that characterizes the quantum in&#8208; formation patterns between quantum atoms as defined in the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules. We show that quantum information analyses capture key properties of quantum atoms and how they interact with their molec&#8208; ular environment. Additionally, we show that the presence of bond critical points can remain invariant despite large changes in the quantum information patterns between the quantum atoms. Our findings indicate that quantum infor&#8208; mation theory can shed a new light on molecular electronic structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization Strategies of Lithium Metal Anode Toward Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries are considered as a most promising rechargeable lithium metal batteries because of their high energy density and low cost. However, the Li&#8208;S batteries mainly suffer the capacity decay issue caused by the shutting effect of lithium polysulfides and the safety issues arising from the Li dendrites formation. This review outlines the current issues of Li&#8208;S batteries. Furthermore, we comprehensively summarized the challenges encountered by Li anode in Li&#8208;S batteries, such as the heterogeneous deposition of the Li anode, the unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer, and volume expansion. Moreover, research progresses in the stabilization strategies of Li anodes (physical approaches, optimization of electrolyte, surface protection layer, and design of current collector) is discussed in detail. Lastly, the remaining challenges and future research directions of Li metal anode stabilization in Li&#8208;S batteries are also present.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of Mesoporous ZnFe2O4@g&#8208;C3N4Heterojunctions for Environmental Remediation and Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mesoporous catalysts with a high specific surface area, accessible pore structures, and appropriate band edges are desirable for optimal charge transfer across the interfaces, suppress electron&#8208;hole recombination, and promote redox reactions at the active sites. The present study demonstrates the rational design of mesoporous ZnFe2O4@g&#8208;C3N4&#160;magnetic nanocomposites (MNCs) with different pore sizes and pore volumes following a combination of facile thermal itching and thermal impregnation methods. The MNCs preserve the structural, morphological, and physical attributes of their counterparts while ensuring their effectiveness and superior catalytic capabilities. The morphological analysis confirms the successful grafting and confinement of ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles&#160;with the polymeric g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets to form heterojunctions with numerous interfaces. The MNCs possess uniformly distributed small mesopores (pore size &lt;4 nm), ample active sites, and a high specific surface area of 62.50 m2/g. The mesoporous ZnFe2O4@g&#8208;C3N4&#160;notably improve hydrogen evolution rate and methylene blue&#160;dye degradation. The optimal loading weight of ZnFe2O4 is 20%, in which the MNCs display the highest hydrogen evolution rate of 1752 &#181;molg&#8208;1h&#8208;1 and photo&#8208;Fenton dye degradation rate constants of 0.147 min&#8722;1, upon solar&#8208;light illumination. Furthermore, the photocatalysts demonstrate recyclability over five consecutive cycles, confirming their stability, while easy separation using a simple magnet underscores practical utility.</dc:description>

         <title>Air and Water Stable Bicyclic (alkyl)(amino)Carbene Stabilized Phosphenium Cation: Reactivity and Selective Fluoride Ion Affinity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and reactivity of an air and water stable Bicyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (BICAAC) stabilized phosphenium cation (1) is reported. Air and water stable phosphenium cation are rare in the literature. Compound 1 is obtained by reaction of BICAAC with Ph2PCl in THF followed by anion exchange with LiOTf. The reduction and oxidation of 1 yielded corresponding &#945;&#8208;radical phosphine species (2) and BICAAC stabilized phosphenium oxide (3) respectively. All compounds are well characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. The Lewis acidity of compounds 1 and 3 are determined by conducting fluoride ion affinity experiments using UV&#8208;Vis spectrophotometry and multinuclei NMR spectroscopy. Compounds 1 and 3 exhibited selective binding to fluoride anion but did not interact with other halides (Cl&#8208; and Br&#8208;). Quantum chemical calculations were performed to understand the structure and nature of bonding interactions in these compounds, as well as to comprehend the specific bonding affinity to fluoride over other halide ions.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a microwave promoted tandem reaction of free primary arylamines with diazo compounds in water for clean synthesis of 2,2&#8208;disubstituted 3&#8208;oxindoles is present. Water plays important roles in the whole cascade process: O&#8208;H insertion to diazo, air oxidation, ortho C&#8208;H functionalization, cyclization and 1,2&#8208;ester migration. In particular, water plays a mediation role in the site selective ortho&#8208;C&#8208;H addition.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in DNA&#8208;Based Nanoprobes for In vivo MiRNA Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a post transcriptional regulator of gene expression, miRNA is closely related to many major human diseases, especially cancer. Therefore, its precise detection is very important for disease diagnosis and treatment. With the advancement of fluorescent dye and imaging technology, the focus has shifted from in vitro microRNAs (miRNA) detection to in vivo miRNA imaging. This concept review summarizes signal amplification strategies including DNAzyme catalytic reaction, hybrid chain reaction (HCR), catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) to enhance detection signal of lowly expressed miRNAs; external stimuli of ultraviolet (UV) light or near&#8208;infrared region (NIR) light, and internal stimuli such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), glutathione (GSH), protease and cell membrane protein to prevent nonspecific activation for the avoidance of false positive signal; and the development of fluorescent probes with emission in NIR for in vivo miRNA imaging; as well as rare earth nanoparticle based the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) nanoprobes with excellent tissue penetration and depth for in vivo miRNA imaging. The concept review also indicated current challenges for in vivo miRNA imaging including the dynamic monitoring of miRNA expression change and simultaneous in vivo imaging of multiple miRNAs.</dc:description>

This concept review summarizes signal amplification strategies including DNAzyme catalytic reaction, hybrid chain reaction (HCR), catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) to enhance detection signal of lowly expressed miRNAs; external stimuli of ultraviolet (UV) light or near-infrared region (NIR) light, and internal stimuli such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), glutathione (GSH), protease and cell membrane protein to prevent nonspecific activation for the avoidance of false positive signal; and the development of fluorescent probes with emission in NIR for in vivo miRNA imaging; as well as rare earth nanoparticle based the second near-infrared window (NIR-II) nanoprobes with excellent tissue penetration and depth for in vivo miRNA imaging. The concept review also indicated current challenges for in vivo miRNA imaging including the dynamic monitoring of miRNA expression change and simultaneous in vivo imaging of multiple miRNAs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lewis Acid Regulation Strategy for Constructing D&#8208;A&#8208;A Covalent Organic Frameworks with Enhanced Photocatalytic Organic Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to their excellent photoelectric properties, donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) type photocatalytic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted significant research interest in recent years. However, the limited D&#8211;A structural units of existing COFs restrict the development of novel and efficient photocatalytic COF materials. To solve this problem, we developed a series of D&#8211;A&#8211;A&#8208;type COFs utilizing a Lewis acid regulation strategy, in which Lewis acids act as the coordination centers, and pyridine and cyano groups act as ligands. Lewis acid sites in COFs serve as electron acceptors, facilitating the separation and transfer of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs. This process is crucial for photocatalysis because it significantly increases the efficiency of the catalytic reaction by reducing the recombination rate of charge carriers. The developed Lewis acid&#8208;activated D&#8211;A&#8211;A COFs efficiently catalyzed the hydroxylation of various phenylboronic acid compounds under visible light. The developed catalysts are expected to contribute to increasing the fabrication efficiency of industrially important organic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating the Topologies and Photoresponsive Properties of Lanthanum&#8208;organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) show potential application in many domains, in which photochromic MOFs (PMOFs) have received enormous attention. Researchers mainly utilize photoactive ligands to build PMOFs. Recently, the mixed electron donating and accepting ligands strategies have also been used to construct PMOFs driven by the electron transfer between nonphotochromic moieties. However, the potential interligand competition inhibits the formation of PMOFs. Therefore, the exploration of single&#8208;ligand&#8208;guided assembly is conductive for building PMOFs. Considering the existing electron accepting and donating role of pyridyl and carboxyl, the pyridinecarboxyate derived from the fusion of pyridyl and carboxyl units may serve as single ligand to yield PMOFs. In this work, the coordination assembly of bipyridinedicarboxylate (2,2'&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;4,4'&#8208;dicarboxylic acid, H2bpdc; 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;2,9&#8208;dicarboxylic acid, H2pda) and LaCl3 generate two PMOFs, [La(bpdc)(H2O)Cl] (1) and [La(pda)(H2O)2Cl]&#183;2H2O (2). Both complexes feature dinuclear lanthanum as building blocks with differences in the connecting number of likers, in which 1 has (4,8)&#8208;connected topology and 2 exhibits sql topology. Their structural differences result in the diversities of photoresponsive functionalities. Compared with reported PMOFs built from photoactive ligands and mixed ligands, this study provides new available categories of single ligand for generating PMOFs and tuning the structure and photoresponsive properties via ligand substitution and external photostimulus.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent triazine&#160;frameworks (CTFs) are promising heterogeneous photocatalyst candidates owing to their excellent stability, conjugacy, and tunability. In this study, a series of CTFs decorated with different substituents (H, MeO, and F) were synthesised and utilised as photocatalysts for C&#8208;H activation reactions. The corresponding optoelectronic properties could be precisely regulated by the electronic effects of different substituents in the nanopore channels of the CTFs; these CTFs were effective photocatalysts for C&#8208;H activation in organic synthesis due to their unique structures and optoelectronic properties. Methoxy&#8208;substituted CTF (MeO&#8208;CTF) exhibited extraordinary catalytic performance and reusability in C&#8208;H functionalization by constructing an electronic donor&#8208;acceptor system, achieving the highest yield in the photocatalytic C3&#8208;H hydroxylation of 2&#8208;phenylimidazole[1,2&#8208;&#945;]pyridine. This strategy provides a new scaffold for the rational design of CTFs as efficient photocatalysts for organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Lysozyme Immobilization on Enzymatic Cellulose Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanostructured materials represent promising substrates for biocatalysts immobilization and activation. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), accessible from waste and/or renewable sources, are sustainable and biodegradable, show high specific surface area for anchoring a high number of enzymatic units, and high thermal and mechanical stability. In this work, we present a holistic enzyme&#8208;based approach to functional antibacterial materials by bioconjugation between the lysozyme from chicken egg white and enzymatic cellulose nanocrystals. The neutral CNCs were prepared by endoglucanase hydrolysis from Avicel. We explore the covalent immobilization of lysozyme on the enzymatic CNCs and on their TEMPO oxidized derivatives (TO&#8208;CNCs), comparing immobilization yields, materials properties, and enzymatic activities. The materials were characterized by X&#8208;ray diffractometry (XRD), attenuated total reflectance Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;FTIR), bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay, field&#8208;emission scanning electron microscopy (FE&#8208;SEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). We demonstrate the higher overall efficiency of the immobilization process carried out on TO&#8208;CNCs, based on the success of covalent bonding and on the stability of the isolated biocojugates.</dc:description>

         <title>Expedited Proton Relay in Enzyme&#8208;Inspired Cobaloximes Facilitate Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We illustrate the oxygen&#8208;tolerant and benign nature of active bio&#8208;inspired cobaloxime complexes featuring the axial coordination with imidazole or histidine. These complexes provide efficient chemical transformations like amine synthesis. This transformation is complemented by concur&#8208;rent evolution of H2 through synergistic utilization of a photocatalyst and a cobaloxime&#8208;based catalyst.







Abstract
Developing a water&#8208;soluble, oxygen&#8208;tolerant, and acid&#8208;stable synthetic H2 production catalyst is vital for renewable energy infrastructure. To access such an effective catalyst, we strategically incorporated enzyme&#8208;inspired, multicomponent outer coordination sphere elements around the cobaloxime (Cl&#8722;Co&#8722;X) core with suitable axial coordination (X). Our cobaloximes with axial imidazole or L&#8208;histidine coordination in photocatalytic HAT including the construction of anilines via a non&#8208;canonical cross&#8208;coupling approach is found superior compared to commonly used cobaloxime catalysts. The reversible Co(II)/Co(I) process is influenced by the axial N ligand's nature. Imidazole/L&#8208;histidine with a higher pKa promptly produces H2 upon irradiation, leading to the improved reactivity compared to previously employed axial (di)chloride or pyridine analogue.

&lt;p&gt;We illustrate the oxygen-tolerant and benign nature of active bio-inspired cobaloxime complexes featuring the axial coordination with imidazole or histidine. These complexes provide efficient chemical transformations like amine synthesis. This transformation is complemented by concur-rent evolution of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through synergistic utilization of a photocatalyst and a cobaloxime-based catalyst.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing a water-soluble, oxygen-tolerant, and acid-stable synthetic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production catalyst is vital for renewable energy infrastructure. To access such an effective catalyst, we strategically incorporated enzyme-inspired, multicomponent outer coordination sphere elements around the cobaloxime (Cl&#8722;Co&#8722;X) core with suitable axial coordination (X). Our cobaloximes with axial imidazole or L-histidine coordination in photocatalytic HAT including the construction of anilines &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; a non-canonical cross-coupling approach is found superior compared to commonly used cobaloxime catalysts. The reversible Co(II)/Co(I) process is influenced by the axial N ligand's nature. Imidazole/L-histidine with a higher pKa promptly produces H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; upon irradiation, leading to the improved reactivity compared to previously employed axial (di)chloride or pyridine analogue.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Impact of Weak Organic Acids as Coagulants on Tailoring the Properties of Cellulose Aerogel Beads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that the physical and microstructural properties of cellulose aerogel beads can be tailored by using weak organic acids such as acetic acid (HAc), lactic acid (HLac) or citric acid (HCit) as coagulants. In comparison to strong hydrochloric acid (HCl), organic acids in the regeneration bath produced densely packed nanofibrillar network and large volume of mesoporous structure.







Abstract
Tailoring the properties of cellulose aerogel beads was investigated in the present study by using weak organic acids as coagulants. Three different weak acids were specifically chosen, acetic acid, lactic acid and citric acid. For comparative studies, a strong acid, hydrochloric acid was examined. The production of aerogel beads by conventional dropping technique was controlled and optimized for weak acids. Aerogels were characterized by density analyses, scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption&#8211;desorption analysis, X&#8208;ray powder diffractometry and IR spectroscopy. In common, all the aerogel beads showed interconnected nanofibrillar network, high specific surface area, high pore volume, high porosity and meso&#8208; and macroporous structure. In particular, when the weakest acid (acetic acid) was used as coagulant in the regeneration bath, the lowest shrinkage was observed. As a result, the cellulose aerogel beads produced from acetic acid showed the highest values of specific surface area (423&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1) and pore volume (3.6&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1). The porous structure can be tuned by the choice of regeneration bath, which has either strong acid or a high concentration of weak acid. The aerogel beads were pure and showed cellulose II crystallinity. Hence this study paves an alternative path way to tailor the properties of cellulose aerogel beads.

         <title>Pillar[n]arene&#8208;Based Fluorescence Turn&#8208;On Chemosensors for the Detection of Spermine, Spermidine, and Cadaverine in Saline Media and Biofluids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research delves into the critical role of fast and efficient polyamine detection utilizing self&#8208;assembled, fluorescent chemosensors based on sulfonated pillar[5]arene as host and diazapyrene indicator dyes. Polyamine&#8208;selective and spermine&#8208;selective host&#8208;guest pairs are introduced. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the developed chemosensors in biofluids like human urine and saliva, offering promising advancements in biomedical diagnostics.







Abstract
Polyamines are essential analytes due to their critical role in various biological processes and human health in general. Due to their role as regulators for cell growth and proliferation (putrescine and spermine), as neuroprotectors, gero&#8208;, and cardiovascular protectors (spermidine), and as bacterial growth indicators (cadaverine), rapid, simple, and cost&#8208;effective methods for polyamine detection in biofluids are in demand. The present study focuses on the development and investigation of self&#8208;assembled and fluorescent host&#8901;dye chemo&#8208;sensors based on sulfonated pillar[5]arene for the specific detection of polyamines. Binding studies, as well as stability and functionality assessments of the turn&#8208;on chemosensors for selective polyamine detection in saline and biologically relevant media, are shown. Furthermore, the practical applicability of the developed chemo&#8208;sensors is demonstrated in biofluids such as human urine and saliva.

         <title>Synthesis of Adhesive Polyrotaxanes through Sequential Self&#8208;Assembly via Supramolecular Interactions and Dynamic Covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly is an effective approach to construct complicated structures. Polyrotaxanes (PRs) as one of the typical polymer types with complex structure, own interlocked structures and dynamic components, in which it results in unique characteristics and functions. Currently, the synthesis of which involves covalent reactions to hinder the development of polyrotaxanes. Herein, we employed supramolecular interactions as well as dynamic covalent bonds to synthesize PRs by sequential self&#8208;assembly. First, we prepared M1 possessing two diamine structures and M2 of a bisammonium salt with two dibenzylammonium (DBA) units modified by two stoppers at its ends, then M1 and M2 self&#8208;assembled into supramolecular polymers stemming from hydrogen bonding of [N+&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O] under high concentrations. After adding 2,6&#8208;pyridinedicarboxaldehyde (M3), the imine bond formation enabled the generation of macrocycles, transforming supramolecular polymers into PRs. Besides, the solution of polyrotaxanes was applied as the adhesive for diverse hard and soft materials. This strategy provides an important approach for synthesizing PRs, accelerating the advances of mechanically interlocked polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Cocatalyst Engineering in Metal&#8208;Semiconductor Hybrid Photocatalysts Achieves a Fivefold Enhancement of Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study explores the optimal morphology of photochemical hydrogen evolution catalysts in a one&#8208;dimensional system. Systematic engineering of metal tips on precisely defined CdSe@CdS dot&#8208;in&#8208;rods is conducted to exert control over morphology, composition, and both factors. The outcome yields an optimized configuration, a Au&#8208;Pt core&#8208;shell structure with a rough Pt surface (Au@r&#8208;Pt), which exhibits a remarkable fivefold increase in quantum efficiency, reaching 86% at 455 nm and superior hydrogen evolution rates under visible and AM1.5G irradiation conditions with prolonged stability. Kinetic investigations using photoelectrochemical and time&#8208;resolved measurements demonstrate a greater extent and extended lifetime of the charge&#8208;separated state on the tips as well as rapid water reduction kinetics on high&#8208;energy surfaces. This approach sheds light on the critical role of cocatalysts in hybrid photocatalytic systems for achieving high performance.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Noninvasive control over the reversible generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) has found the enormous practical implications in the field of biomedical science. However, metal&#8208;free pure organic emitters, connected with a photoswitch, capable of generating &#8220;on&#8208;demand&#8221; 1O2 via triplet harvesting remain exceedingly rare; therefore, the utilization of these organic materials for the reversible control of singlet oxygen production remains at its infancy.&#160;Herein, an ambient triplet mediated emission in quinoline&#8208;dithienylethene (DTE)&#8208;core&#8208;substituted naphthalene diimide (cNDI) derivative is unveiled via delayed fluorescence. The quinoline&#8208;DTE&#8208;cNDI triad displayed enhanced photoswitching efficiency via double FRET mechanism.&#160;&#160;It was found to have direct utilization in controlled photosensitized organic transformations via efficient generation of singlet oxygen (yield &#934;&#916; ~ 0.73). The designed molecule exhibits a long&#8208;lived emission (&#964; &#8764; 1.1 &#956;s) and very small singlet&#8208;triplet splitting (&#916;SET) of 0.13 eV empowering it to display delayed fluorescence. Comprehensive steady state and time&#8208;resolved emission spectroscopy (TRES) analyses along with DFT calculations offer detailed understandings into the excited&#8208;state manifolds of organic compound and energy transfer (ET) pathways involved in 1O2 generation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we report an efficient strategy towards the synthesis of amino acid substituted isoquinoline derivatives&#160;via&#160;reaction of unprotected amino acid/amino acid ester/amino acid based drugs with 2&#8208;(2&#8208;oxo&#8208;2&#8208;aryl/alkylethyl)benzonitrile under metal&#8208;free conditions. The developed protocol is highly simple and shows functional group tolerance to provide corresponding novel amino acid substituted isoquinolines in aqueous medium. The applicability of the reaction is an easier modification of well&#8208;known drugs and successfully extended to gram&#8208;scale synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Steric Engineering of Rotaxane Catalysts: Benefits and Limits of Using the Mechanical Bond in Catalyst Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanical bond is emerging as a novel design element in catalyst development. Here, we report a series of 1,1&#180;&#8209;binaphthyl&#8208;2,2&#180;&#8208;diol (BINOL) based catalysts in which the number of interlocked macrocycles is varied. Unsurprisingly, the macrocycles have a profound steric influence on the catalytic performance of these molecules. However, in the enantioselective transformations examined, the macrocycles are detrimental to catalyst stereoselectivity whereas in lactide polymerization, they increase the molecular weight of the polymeric product.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyanide Linkage Isomerization Induced by Cobalt Oxidation&#8208;State Changes at a Co&#8208;Fe Prussian&#8208;Blue Analogue/ZnO Interface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the interfacial composition in heterostructures is crucial for tailoring heterogenous electrochemical and photoelectrochemical processes. This work aims to elucidate the structure of a series of Co&#8208;Fe Prussian blue analogue modified ZnO (PBA/ZnO) electrodes with interface&#8208;sensitive vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy. Our measurements revealed, for the first time, a cyanide linkage isomerism at the PBA/ZnO interface, when the composite is fabricated at elevated temperatures. In situ VSFG spectro&#8208;electrochemistry measurements correlate the CoII&#10141;CoIII oxidation with the flip of the bridging CN ligand from Co&#8208;NC&#8208;Fe coordination mode to a Co&#8208;CN&#8208;Fe one.&#160; Photoluminescence measurements and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that this unprecedented linkage isomerism originates from surface defects, which act as oxidation sites for the PBA. The presence of such surface defects is correlated with the fabrication temperature for PBA/ZnO. Thus, this contribution identifies the interplay between the surface states of the ZnO substrates and the chemical composition of PBA at the ZnO surface, suggesting an easily accessible approach to control the chemical composition of the interface.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report on dual, light&#8208;responsive and redox&#8208;active foldamers that demonstrate reversible and robust stimuli&#8208;induced behaviour. Herein, UV/Vis, 1H NMR and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry have been used to establish the reversibility and highly robust nature of the light&#8208; and redox&#8208;driven behaviour of these new foldamers with minimal levels of fatigue observed even upon multiple cyclic treatments with irradiative/non&#8208;irradiative and oxidative/reductive conditions. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept work paves the way towards the creation of novel stimuli&#8208;responsive foldamers of increasing sophistication capable of demonstrating reversible and robust responses to multiple distinct stimuli.</dc:description>

         <title>Conjugated Coordination Nanosheets with Molecular Rotors for Pseudocapacitors: Nanoarchitectonics and Enhanced Performance.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;level pseudocapacitive materials require incorporations of significant redox regions into conductive and penetrable skeletons to enable the creation of devices capable of delivering high power for extended periods. Coordination nanosheets (CNs) are appealing materials for their high natural electrical conductivities, huge explicit surface regions, and semi&#8208;one&#8208;layered adjusted pore clusters. Thus, rational design of ligands and topological networks with desired electronic structure is required for the advancement in this field. Herein, we report three novel conjugated CNs (RV&#8208;10&#8208;M, M = Zn, Ni, and Co), by utilizing the full conjugation of the terpyridine&#8208;attached flexible tetraphenylethylene (TPE) units as the molecular rotors at the center. We prepare binder&#8208;free transparent nanosheets supported on Ni&#8208;foam with outstanding pseudocapacitive properties via a hydrothermal route followed by facile exfoliation. Among three CNs, the high surface area of RV&#8208;10&#8208;Co facilitates fast transport of ions and electrons and could achieve a high specific capacity of 670.8 C/g (1677 F/g) at 1 A/g current density. Besides, the corresponding flexible RV&#8208;10&#8208;Co possesses a maximum energy density of 37.26 Wh kg&#8208;1 at a power density of 171 W kg&#8208;1 and 70% capacitance retention even after 1000 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a Multi&#8208;Stimulus Responsive RGB Fluorescent Organic Molecule based on Dark Through&#8208;Bond Energy Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, a novel multi&#8208;stimulus responsive RGB fluorescent organic molecule, RTPE&#8208;NH2, was designed and synthesized based on the combination of aggregation&#8208;induced emission tetraphenylethylene (TPE) luminophore and acid&#8208;responsive fluorescent molecular switch Rhodamine B. RTPE&#8208;NH2 exhibits aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior, as well as UV irradiation&#8208;stimulus and acid&#8208;stimulus responsive fluorescence properties. It could emit orange&#8208;red (R), green(G), and blue(B) light in both solution and PMMA film under 365 nm excitation. The dark through&#8208;bond energy transfer (DTBET) mechanism was proposed and supported by control experiments and TD&#8208;DFT calculations. The synthesis and application of RTPE&#8208;NH2 could accelerate the development of organic smart materials with high sensitivity and excellent optical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Corrin Ring Modifications Reveal the Chemical and Spatial Requirements for the B12&#8208;btuB Riboswitch Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To find the structural requirements of a B12&#8208;derivative to bind and switch the btuB riboswitch we derivatised the corrin sidechains b and e as well as the apical ligand. While modifications at the sidechains have a large impact on the riboswitch, introduction of an apical adenosyl&#8208;ligand restores the riboswitch fold.







Abstract
The btuB riboswitch is a regulatory RNA sequence controlling gene expression of the outer membrane B12 transport protein BtuB by specifically binding coenzyme B12 (AdoCbl) as its natural ligand. The B12 sensing riboswitch class is known to accept various B12 derivatives, leading to a division into two riboswitch subclasses, dependent on the size of the apical ligand. Here we focus on the role of side chains b and e on affinity and proper recognition, i.&#8201;e. correct structural switch of the btuB RNA, which belongs to the AdoCbl&#8208;binding class I. Chemical modification of these side chains disturbs crucial hydrogen bonds and/or electrostatic interactions with the RNA, its effect on both affinity and switching being monitored by in&#8208;line probing. Chemical modifications at sidechain b of vitamin B12 show larger effects indicating crucial B12&#8208;RNA interactions. When introducing the same modification to AdoCbl the influence of any side&#8208;chain modification tested is reduced. This renders the impact of the adenosyl&#8208;ligand for B12&#8208;btuB riboswitch recognition clearly beyond the known role in affinity.

         <title>Towards Sustainable Materials: A Review of Acylhydrazone Chemistry for Reversible Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the advancements in acylhydrazone dynamic chemistry within reversible polymers and its various applications in materials chemistry. Additionally, it investigates the potential for polymer reprocessing and recycling to support the circular economy.







Abstract
Transitioning towards a circular economy, extensive research has focused on dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs) to pave the way for more sustainable materials. These bonds enable debonding and rebonding on demand, as well as facilitating end&#8208;of&#8208;life recycling. Acylhydrazone/hydrazone chemistry offers a material with high stability under neutral and basic conditions making it a promising candidate for materials research, though the material is susceptible to acid degradation. However, this degradation under acidic conditions can be exploited, making it widely applicable in self&#8208;healing and biomedical fields, with potential for reprocessing and recycling. This review highlights studies exploring the reversibility of acylhydrazone/hydrazone bonds in various polymers, altering their properties, and utilizing them in applications such as self&#8208;healing, reprocessing, and recycling. The review also focuses on how the mechanical properties are affected by the presence of dynamic linkages, and methods to improve the mechanical performance.

         <title>Proton Conducting Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) via Post Synthetic Transmetallation and Water Induced Structural Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bimetallic MOFs are demonstrated to exhibit transmetallation via post synthetic modifications. The green crystals of Cu&#8208;MOF convert to blue crystals via single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation as the coordinated DMA is exchanged with water. These MOFs exhibit notable proton conductivities ranging from 10&#8722;3 to 10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 under variable temperatures and humidity levels.







Abstract
Post Synthetic Modification (PSM) of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) is a crucial strategy for developing new MOFs with enhanced functional properties compared to their parent one. PSM can be accomplished through various methods:1) modification of organic linkers; 2) exchange of metal ions or nodes; and 3) inclusion or exchange of solvent/guest molecules. Herein, PSM of bimetallic and monometallic MOFs containing biphenyl dinitro&#8208;tetra&#8208;carboxylates (NCA) are demonstrated. The tetra carboxylate NCA, produces monometallic Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 and Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 and bimetallic CoZn&#8208;MOF in solvothermal reactions with the corresponding metal salts. The CoZn&#8208;MOF undergoes post&#8208;synthetic transmetallation with Cd(NO3)2 and Cu(NO3)2 in aqueous solution to yield Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 and Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;2, respectively. Additionally, green crystals of Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 found to undergo a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation to blue crystals of Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;3 upon dipped into water at room temperature. These MOFs demonstrate notable proton conductivities ranging from 10&#8722;3 to 10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 under variable temperatures and humidity levels. Among them, Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;3 achieves the highest proton conductivity of 1.36&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 90&#8201;&#176;C and 98&#8201;% relative humidity, attributed to its continuous and extensive hydrogen bonding network, which provides effective proton conduction pathways within the MOF. This work highlights a convenient strategy for designing proton&#8208;conducting MOFs via post&#8208;synthetic modification.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Itaconic Acid Derivatives via Chemodivergent Single and Double Carboxylation of Allenes with CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Allenoates prove competence in the synthesis of itaconic acid derivatives and tri&#8208;carboxylated compounds via site&#8208;selective electrochemical fixation of one or two molecules of CO2 (yields up to 87&#8201;%). Complete chemodivergency is realized via dedicated electrolytic conditions optimization.







Abstract
Leveraging electrochemistry, a new synthesis of non&#8208;natural derivatives of itaconic acid is proposed by utilizing carbon dioxide (CO2) as a valuable C1 synthon. An electrochemical cross&#8208;electrophile coupling between allenoates and CO2 was targeted, allowing for the synthesis of both mono&#8208; and di&#8208;carboxylation products in a catalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free environment (yields up to 87&#8201;%, 30 examples). Elaboration of the model mono&#8208;carboxylation product, and detailed cyclovoltammetric, as well as mechanistic analyses complete the present investigation.

         <title>Borospherene in the Nanohoop: Complexation and Aromaticity of Neutral and Dioxidized Cycloparaphenylene Supramolecules with B40 and C60 Fullerenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[9]&#8208; and [10]&#8208;Cycloparaphenylenes encapsulate borospherene B40 forming host&#8208;guest complexes with comparable complexation energy to carbon fullerenes, exhibiting double host&#8208;guest aromaticity at the dioxidized state.







Abstract
Supramolecular complexes of carbon nanohoops with fullerenes play a key role for the design of novel nanomaterials with technological applications. Herein we investigate with density functional theory (DFT) methods the capability of neutral and dioxidized cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) to encapsulate all&#8208;boron fullerene B40. Our results show that [9]CPP and [10]CPP are feasible host candidates to encapsulate B40 displaying comparable complexation energies with the all&#8208;carbon analog [10]CPP&#8835;C60. Upon dioxidation the host&#8208;guest interactions are not affected, whereas the positive charge is delocalized on the CPPs leading to global aromatic character of the hosts. Consequently, the dicationic complexes [n]CPP2+&#8835;B40 and [10]CPP2+&#8835;C60 display augmented global shielding cones that strongly shield the guests, as manifested by large upfield shifts in 11B&#8208;NMR and 13C&#8208;NMR signals. Hence, CPP complexes with carbon fullerenes can be extended borospherene B40 host&#8208;guest complexes, as well as to doubly oxidized species stabilized by global host aromaticity, expanding our understanding of carbon nanohoop complexes to boron&#8208;based fullerenes.

         <title>Achieving Non&#8208;Interfacial Blocking Zinc Ion Transport Based on MOF Derived Manganese Oxides and Amorphous Carbon Hybrid Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Base on the combination of co&#8208;precipitation method and carbonization, the architecture of non&#8208;interfacial blocking manganese oxides and amorphous carbon hybrid materials are synthesized. MOF&#8208;derived hybrid electrodes obtained a specific capacity of 132.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and it still has a specific capacity of 105&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for 2000 cycles. In addition, the electrode reaction mechanism of MOF&#8208;derived hybrid electrodes in ZIBs is analyzed by ex&#8208;situ XRD and in&#8208;situ Raman tests and the model battery is assembled to present practical possibilities. This study provides an innovation strategy for efficient electron ion transport of Mn&#8208;based materials, and offers a route to the practical electrode of ZIBs.







Abstract
How to coordinate electron and ion transport behavior across scales and interfaces within ion battery electrodes? The exponential increase in surface area observed in nanoscale electrode materials results in an incomprehensibly vast spatial interval. Herein, to address the problems of volume expansion, dissolution of cathode material, and the charge accumulation problem existing in manganiferous materials for zinc ion batteries, metal organic framework is utilized to form the architecture of non&#8208;interfacial blocking ~10&#8197;nm Mn2O3 nanoparticles and amorphous carbon hybrid electrode materials, demonstrating a high specific capacity of 361&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and excellent cycle stability of 105&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles under 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The uniform and non&#8208;separated disposition of Mn and C atoms constitutes an interconnected network with high electronic and ionic conductivity, minimizing issues like structural collapse and volume expansion of the electrode material during cycling. The cooperative insert mechanism of H+ and Zn2+ are analyzed via ex&#8208;situ XRD and in&#8208;situ Raman tests. The model battery is assembled to present practical possibilities. The results indicate that MOF&#8208;derived carbonization provides an effective strategy for exploring Mn&#8208;based electrode materials with high ion and electron transport capacity.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Breaking and Symmetry&#8208;Retaining Morphological Evolution of the Single Crystals of Cyclodextrin Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing lower symmetry elements (&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrins and &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins) into a high symmetry system (&#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework), two different morphology evolution paths have been realized, representing symmetry&#8208;retaining and symmetry&#8208;breaking, respectively.







Abstract
The morphological symmetry&#8208;retaining and symmetry&#8208;breaking of single crystals of the &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin metal&#8208;organic framework have been achieved via introducing lower symmetric &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrins and &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins, respectively. &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrins led to a morphological evolution with retained symmetry from cubic to rhombic dodecahedra, while &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins resulted in the original cubic crystal missing a vertex angle presenting symmetry&#8208;breaking behavior. The crystal structures of rhombic dodecahedra and angle&#8208;deficient crystals were confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallography, and the mechanisms underlying the morphological transformation evolution were further analyzed. Our work not only provides a rare case realizing two different paths of morphological evolution in one system, but also encourages future efforts towards the evolution of artificial crystal systems in a natural way.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic capsid&#8208;like nanoshells (CLNs) were prepared through the solution self&#8208;assembly of poly (&#946;&#8208;phenethyl&#8208;L&#8208;aspartate) homopolypeptide (PPLA). The formation of CLNs follows an aggregation&#8208;fusion process, where the molecular flexibility of PPLA is crucial for the arrangement and fusion of subunits (SSA). These findings offer new perspectives for a deeper understanding of the formation pathways of CLNs derived from synthetic polymers.







Abstract
The preparation of capsid&#8208;like nanoshells and the elucidation of their formation pathways are crucial for the application potential of capsid&#8208;like nanomaterials. In this study, we have prepared biomimetic capsid&#8208;like nanoshells (CLNs) through the solution self&#8208;assembly of poly (&#946;&#8208;phenethyl&#8208;L&#8208;aspartate) homopolypeptide (PPLA). The formation of CLNs is governed by an aggregation&#8208;fusion mechanism. Initially, PPLA molecules self&#8208;assemble into small spherical assemblies as subunits and the initial nuclei are formed through fusing some subunits. Subsequently, additional subunits rapidly fuse onto these nuclei, leading to the growth of full or partial CLNs during the growth phase. Moreover, the suitable condition benefiting CLNs formation is clarified by a morphological phase diagram based on the initial PPLA concentration against water content. Molecular&#8208;level measurements suggest that the molecular flexibility of PPLA is a key factor in the arrangement and fusion of subunits for the formation of CLNs. These findings offer new perspectives for a deeper understanding of the formation pathways of capsid&#8208;like nanoshells derived from synthetic polymers.

         <title>Structural Deformations in Cucurbit[n]urils: Analysis, Host&#8208;Guest Dependence, and Automated Ellipticity Measurements using ElliptiCB[n]</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n]s) are cyclic macrocycles with rich host&#8208;guest chemistry. In many cases, guest binding in CB[n]s results in structural deformations. Unfortunately, measuring such deformations remains a major challenge, with only a handful of manual estimations reported in the literature. To address this challenge, we have developed the public program ElliptiCB[n], which is available on GitHub, that provides a robust and automated method for measuring the elliptical deformations in CB[n] hosts. We outline the development and validation of this approach, apply ElliptiCB[n] to measure to the ellipticity of the 1113 available CB[n] structures from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD), and directly investigate the structural deformations of CB[5], CB[6], CB[7], CB[8], and CB[10]. We also report the general landscape of accessible CB[n] elliptical deformations and compare ellipticity distributions across CB[n] hosts and host&#8208;guest complexes. We found that in almost all cases guest binding significant impacts the distribution of host ellipticity distributions and that ellipticity distributions are dissimilar across host&#8208;guest complexes of differently sized CB[n]s. We anticipate that this work will provide a useful approach for understanding of the flexibility of CB[n] hosts and will also enable future measurement and standardization of ellipticity measurements of CB[n]s.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunning the electronic properties of bridged dithienyl&#8208;, difuryl&#8208;, dipyrrolyl&#8208;vinylene as precursors of small bandgap conjugated polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optoelectronic properties of linear &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers/oligomers are of great importance for the fabrication of organic photonic and electronic devices. To this end, the &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers/oligomers need to meet both optoelectronic and key structural properties in order to fulfill their implementation as active components. In particular, they need to possess low bandgap and high thermal, conformational, and photochemical stabilities. So far, several strategies have been developed to attain such requirements including the covalent and non&#8208;covalent rigidification concepts of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. On the basis of these findings, we describe herein the theoretical studies of novel series of covalently bridged derivatives demonstrating the benefits of the strategy. Comparison of these derivatives with compounds previously described in the literature highlights enhanced optoelectronic properties and behaviors that would be beneficial for the construction and development of new linear &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>The Key to MOF Membrane Fabrication and Application: the Trade&#8208;off between Crystallization and Film Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), owing the merits of ordered and tailored channel structures in the burgeoning crystalline porous materials, have demonstrated significant promise in construction of high&#8208;performance separation membranes. However, precisely because this crystal structure with strong molecular interaction in their lattice provides robust structural integrity and resistance to chemical and thermal degradation, crystalline MOFs typically exhibit insolubility, infusibility, stiffness and brittleness, and therefore their membrane&#8208;processing properties are far inferior to the flexible amorphous polymers and hinder their subsequent storage, transportation, and utilization. Hence, focusing on film&#8208;formation and crystallization is the foundation for exploring the fabrication and application of MOF membranes. In this review, the film&#8208;forming properties of crystalline MOFs are fundamentally analyzed from their inherent characteristics and compared with those of amorphous polymers, influencing factors of polycrystalline MOF membrane formation are summarized, the trade&#8208;off relationship between crystallization and membrane formation is discussed, and the strategy solving the film formation of crystalline MOFs in recent years are systematically reviewed, in anticipation of realizing the goal of preparing crystalline membranes with optimized processability and excellent performance.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Difunctionalizations of alkenes represent one of the most straightforward protocols to build molecular complexity due to the simultaneous construction of two vicinal bonds cross &#960;&#8208;bond of alkenes. It is extremely attractive yet challenging to control the stereochemistry outcome of this event. Over the past years, visible&#8208;light and Ni&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric difunctionalizations of alkenes provide an environmental benign and promising solution for the construction of saturated carbon centers with the control of regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. In this Concept, the initiative and progress of regio&#8208; and enantioselective difunctionalizations of alkenes enabled by visible&#8208;light and nickel catalysis has been summarized. Moreover, further efforts and directions for the development of visible&#8208;light mediated Ni&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric difunctionalizations of alkenes has been discussed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>New cobalt(II)&#8208;based complexes with [N2O2] coordination formed by two bis&#8208;chelate ligands were synthesized and characterized by a multi&#8208;technique approach.

         <title>Revisiting the Mechanism of Asymmetric Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Carbo&#8208;Carboxylation with CO2: The Additives Affect the Product Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT methods were used to revisit the mechanism of the Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive carbo&#8208;carboxylation of alkenes with CO2. Our results indicate that zinc salts can alter the product selectivity, whereas Mg(II) and Li(I) salts activate CO2 during C&#8722;CO2 bond formation.







Abstract
The mechanistic details of the asymmetric Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive cyclization/carboxylation of alkenes with CO2 have been revisited using DFT methods. Emphasis was put on the enantioselectivity and the mechanistic role of Lewis acid additives and in&#8197;situ formed salts. Our results show that oxidative addition of the substrate is rate&#8208;limiting, with the formed Ni(II)&#8208;aryl intermediate preferring a triplet spin state. After reduction to Ni(I), enantioselective cyclization of the substrate occurs, followed by inner sphere carboxylation. Our proposed mechanism reproduces the experimentally observed enantiomeric excess and identifies critical C&#8722;H/O and C&#8722;H/N interactions that affect the selectivity. Further, our results highlight the beneficial effect of Lewis acids on CO2 insertion and suggest that in&#8197;situ formed salts influence if the 5&#8208;exo or 6&#8208;endo product will be formed.

         <title>Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reaction via Vinylidene Ortho&#8208;Quinone Methides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A review of chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reaction via VQMs with emphasis on methodology innovation and mechanistic rationale is summarized. The remained challenges and opportunities for potential breakthroughs in this area are also presented.







Abstract
Vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methides (VQMs) have been proven to be versatile and crucial intermediates in the catalytic asymmetric reaction in last decade, and thus have drawn considerable concentrations on account of the practical application in the construction of enantiomerically pure functional organic molecules. However, in comparison to the well established chiral Br&#248;nsted base&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reaction via VQMs, chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction is rarely studied and there is no systematic summary to date. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in the chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reaction via VQMs according to three types of reactions: a) intermolecular asymmetric nucleophilic addition to VQMs; b) intermolecular asymmetric cycloaddition of VQMs; c) intramolecular asymmetric cyclization of VQMs. Finally, we put forward the remained challenges and opportunities for potential breakthroughs in this area.

         <title>Redox Behaviour and Redox Potentials of Dyes in Aqueous Buffers and Protic Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active protic ionic liquids hold promise as low&#8208;cost, high energy density electrolytes for redox flow batteries. Their redox behaviour is similar to parent salts in pH&#8208;neutral aqueous buffer, although they may undergo different side reactions. In this work, fortuitous side&#8208;reactions yield quinone&#8208;imines which display promising electrochemistry for flow battery applications.







Abstract
Organic dyes hold promise as inexpensive electrochemically&#8208;active building blocks for new renewable energy technologies such as redox&#8208;flow batteries and dye&#8208;sensitised solar cells, especially if they display high oxidation and/or low reduction potentials in cheap, non&#8208;flammable solvents such as water or protic ionic liquids. Systematic computational and experimental characterisation of a representative selection of acidic and basic dyes in buffered aqueous solutions and propylammonium formate confirm that quinoid&#8208;type mechanisms impart electrochemical reversibility for the majority of systems investigated, including quinones, fused tricyclic heteroaromatics, indigo carmine and some aromatic nitrogenous species. Conversely, systems that generate longlived radical intermediates &#8211; arylmethanes, hydroquinones at high pH, azocyclic systems &#8211; tend to display irreversible electrochemistry, likely undergoing ring&#8208;opening, dimerisation and/or disproportionation reactions.

         <title>Improving Molecular&#8208;Dynamics Simulations for Solid&#8211;Liquid Interfaces with Machine&#8208;Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have summarized the evolution of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), introduced some interesting examples applied at solid&#8208;liquid interfaces, and finally posed some prospects for the current challenge of MLIPs.







Abstract
Emerging developments in artificial intelligence have opened infinite possibilities for material simulation. Depending on the powerful fitting of machine learning algorithms to first&#8208;principles data, machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) can effectively balance the accuracy and efficiency problems in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, serving as powerful tools in various complex physicochemical systems. Consequently, this brings unprecedented enthusiasm for researchers to apply such novel technology in multiple fields to revisit the major scientific problems that have remained controversial owing to the limitations of previous computational methods. Herein, we introduce the evolution of MLIPs, provide valuable application examples for solid&#8211;liquid interfaces, and present current challenges. Driven by solving multitudinous difficulties in terms of the accuracy, efficiency, and versatility of MLIPs, this booming technique, combined with molecular simulation methods, will provide an underlying and valuable understanding of interdisciplinary scientific challenges, including materials, physics, and chemistry.

         <title>In Situ Generation and High Bioresistance of Trityl&#8208;based Semiquinone Methide Radicals Under Anaerobic Conditions in Cellular Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ quantitative generation of trityl&#8208;based semiquinone methide radical OXQM&#8901; in cellular systems has been achieved from the quinone methide OXQM under anaerobic conditions. OXQM&#8901; with an EPR single line signal at physiological pH exhibits unprecedented high stability against bioreduction and thus shows great application potential in in&#8208;cell magnetic resonance&#8208;related techniques.







Abstract
Bioreduction of spin labels and polarizing agents (generally stable radicals) has been an obstacle limiting the in&#8208;cell applications of pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). In this work, we have demonstrated that two semiquinone methide radicals (OXQM&#8901; and CTQM&#8901;) can be easily produced from the trityl&#8208;based quinone methides (OXQM and CTQM) via reduction by various reducing agents including biothiols and ascorbate under anaerobic conditions. Both radicals have relatively low pKa's and exhibit EPR single line signals at physiological pH. Moreover, the bioreduction of OXQM in three cell lysates enables quantitative generation of OXQM&#8901; which was most likely mediated by flavoenzymes. Importantly, the resulting OXQM&#8901; exhibited extremely high stability in the E.coli lysate under anaerobic conditions with 76&#8208; and 14.3&#8208;fold slower decay kinetics as compared to the trityl OX063 and a gem&#8208;diethyl pyrrolidine nitroxide, respectively. Intracellular delivery of OXQM into HeLa cells was also achieved by covalent conjugation with a cell&#8208;permeable peptide as evidenced by the stable intracellular EPR signal from the OXQM&#8901; moiety. Owing to extremely high resistance of OXQM&#8901; towards bioreduction, OXQM and its derivatives show great application potential in in&#8208;cell EPR and in&#8208;cell DNP studies for various cells which can endure short&#8208;term anoxic treatments.

         <title>ABNOH&#8208;Linked Nucleotides and DNA for Bioconjugation and Cross&#8208;linking with Tryptophan&#8208;Containing Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactive probes based on ABNOH&#8208;linked nucleotides, oligonucleotides or DNA were designed and synthesized for specific cross&#8208;linking and bioconjugation with tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides and proteins.







Abstract
Reactive N&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;9&#8208;azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (ABNOH) linked 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine 5&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;mono&#8208; and triphosphates were synthesized through a CuAAC reaction of ABNOH&#8208;PEG4&#8208;N3 with 5&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;dUMP or &#8208;dUTP. The modified triphosphate was used as substrate for enzymatic synthesis of modified DNA probes with KOD XL DNA polymerase. The keto&#8208;ABNO radical reacted with tryptophan (Trp) and Trp&#8208;containing peptides to form a stable tricyclic fused hexahydropyrrolo&#8208;indole conjugates. Similarly modified ABNOH&#8208;linked nucleotides reacted with Trp&#8208;containing peptides to form a stable conjugate in the presence but surprisingly even in the absence of NaNO2 (presumably through activation by O2). The reactive ABNOH&#8208;modified DNA probe was used for bioconjugations and crosslinking with Trp&#8208;containing peptides or proteins.

         <title>Lyso&#8208;H2S: A Mycophenolic Acid&#8208;Derived Probe for Ultra&#8208;Low Toxicity, Intracellular H2S Detection, and Zebrafish Model Validation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the MPA scaffold&#8208;inspired fluorescent probe Lyso&#8208;H2S that allows H2S detection with an LOD of 41.8&#8197;nM. It is a highly sensitive and selective fluorescent probe that detects H2S in lysosomes based on the PET+ ESIPT sensing mechanism. The probe allows for real&#8208;time monitoring of H2S in vivo, particularly in the intestine and gallbladder of a zebrafish. Lyso&#8208;H2S was successfully employed in the endogenous and exogenous imaging of H2S in living cells.







Abstract
In several biological processes, H2S is known to function as an endogenous gaseous agent. It is very necessary to monitor H2S and relevant physiological processes in&#8197;vivo. Herein, a new type of fluorophore with a reliable leaving group allows for excited&#8208;state intramolecular transfer characteristics (ESIPT), inspired by mycophenolic acid. A morpholine ring was connected at the maleimide position of the probe to target the lysosome. Subsequently, the dinitrophenyl group known for a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) effect, was connected to allow for an effective &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; probe Lyso&#8208;H2S. Lyso&#8208;H2S demonstrated strong selectivity towards H2S, a large Stokes shift (111&#8197;nm), and an incredibly low detection limit (41.8&#8197;nM). The imaging of endogenous and exogenous H2S in living cells (A549&#8197;cell line) was successfully achieved because of the specificity and ultra&#8208;low toxicity (100&#8201;% cell viability at 50&#8197;&#956;M concentration of Lyso&#8208;H2S.) Additionally, Lyso&#8208;H2S was also employed to visualize the activity of H2S in the gallbladder and intestine in a living zebrafish model. This is the first report of a fluorescent probe to track H2S sensing in specific organ systems to our knowledge.

         <title>Elucidating the Mechanism of Efficient Eu(III) and Yb(III) Sensitisation from a Re(I) Tetrazolato Triangular Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triangular assembly featuring three Re(I) and three Eu(III) centres displays an unprecedented sensitisation efficiency, around 90&#8201;%, whereby the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligang charget transfer excited state of the Re(I) complex acts as a sensitiser for the Eu(III) emission. Spectroscopic investigation reveals that the sensitisation proceeds via a thermally activated two&#8208;step mechanism involving the bridging terpyridine ligand, and provides new insights for the design of d&#8208;f assemblies with efficient luminescent properties.







Abstract
The reaction of Re(CO)5Br with deprotonated 1H&#8208;(5&#8208;(2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine)pyrid&#8208;2&#8208;yl)tetrazole yields a triangular assembly formed by tricarbonyl Re(I) vertices. Photophysical measurements reveal blue&#8208;green emission with a maximum at 520&#8197;nm, 32&#8201;% quantum yield, and 2430&#8197;ns long&#8208;lived excited state decay lifetime in deaerated dichloromethane solution. Coordination of lanthanoid ions to the terpyridine units red&#8208;shifts the emission to 570&#8197;nm and also reveals efficient (90&#8201;%) and fast sensitisation of both Eu(III) and Yb(III) at room temperature, with a similar rate constant kET on the order of 107&#8197;s&#8722;1. Efficient sensitisation of Eu(III) from Re(I) is unprecedented, especially when considering the close proximity in energy between the donor and acceptor excited states. On the other hand, comparative measurements at 77&#8197;K reveal that energy transfer to Yb(III) is two orders of magnitude slower than that to Eu(III). A two&#8208;step mechanism of sensitisation is therefore proposed, whereby the rate&#8208;determining step is a thermally activated energy transfer step between the Re(I) centre and the terpyridine functionality, followed by rapid energy transfer to the respective Ln(III) excited states. At 77&#8197;K, the direct Re(I) to Eu(III) energy transfer seems to proceed via a ligand&#8208;mediated superexchange Dexter&#8208;type mechanism.

         <title>Aromaticity in the Spectroscopic Spotlight of Hexaphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through TD&#8208;DFT calculations, aromaticity descriptors, and chemical compound space maps, we connected the spectroscopic fingerprints of functionalized hexaphyrins to the macrocycle's aromaticity. While the intensity of the Q&#8208;band in the NIR region is well described by (&#916;HOMO&#8211;&#916;LUMO)2 and not by their aromaticity descriptors, highly planar and hexaphyrin structures showing large aromaticity and antiaromaticity exhibit an intense B&#8208;band.







Abstract
Spectroscopic properties are commonly used in the experimental evaluation of ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state aromaticity in expanded porphyrins. Herein, we investigate if the defining photophysical properties still hold for a diverse set of hexaphyrins with varying redox states, topologies, peripheral substitutions, and core&#8208;modifications. By combining TD&#8208;DFT calculations with several aromaticity descriptors and chemical compound space maps, the intricate interplay between structural planarity, aromaticity, and absorption spectra is elucidated. Our results emphasize that the general assumption that antiaromatic porphyrinoids exhibit significantly attenuated absorption bands as compared to aromatic counterparts does not hold even for the unsubstituted hexaphyrin macrocycles. To connect the spectroscopic properties to the hexaphyrins&#8217; aromaticity behaviour, we analyzed chemical compound space maps defined by the various aromaticity indices. The intensity of the Q&#8208;band is not well described by the macrocyclic aromaticity. Instead, the degeneracy of the frontier molecular orbitals, the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, and the |&#916;HOMO&#8211;&#916;LUMO|2 values appear to be better indicators to identify hexaphyrins with enhanced light&#8208;absorbing abilities in the near&#8208;infrared region. Regions with highly planar hexaphyrin structures, both aromatic and antiaromatic, are characterized by an intense B&#8208;band. Hence, we advise using a combination of global and local aromaticity descriptors rooted in different criteria to assess the aromaticity of expanded porphyrins instead of solely relying on the absorption spectra.

         <title>Stereoselective Crystallization of Chiral Pharmaceuticals Aided by Cellulose Derivatives through Helical Pattern Matching</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel design principle of helical pattern matching between the polymeric additives and the crystal surfaces are proposed for the stereoselective crystallization of chiral pharmaceuticals. A novel design principle of helical pattern matching between polymeric additives and crystal surfaces is proposed for the stereoselective crystallization of chiral pharmaceuticals. This method, demonstrated with nimodipine, guaifenesin, and phenyl lactic acid, achieves high enantiomeric purity, highlighting a new strategy for using natural biomolecules in chiral recognition and resolution.







Abstract
Stereoselective inhibition aided by &#8220;tailor&#8208;made&#8221; polymeric additives is an efficient approach to obtain enantiopure compounds through conglomerate crystallization. The chemical and configurational match between the side groups of polymers and the molecules of undesired enantiomer is considered to be a necessary condition for successful stereoseparation. Whereas in this contribution, we present an effective resolution of chiral pharmaceuticals by using cellulose acetates as the additives, which stereoselectively reside on the specific crystal faces of one enantiomer and inhibit its crystal nucleation and growth through helical pattern and supramolecular interaction complementarity. An investigation of nimodipine serves as a case study to highlight the novelty of this strategy wherein R&#8208;crystals exhibiting an impressive enantiomeric excess value of 97&#8201;% can be attained by employing a mere 0.01&#8197;wt&#8201;% cellulose acetate. Guaifenesin and phenyl lactic acid are also well&#8208;resolved by utilizing this methodology. Our work not only brings about a brand&#8208;new design strategy for &#8220;tailor&#8208;made&#8221; additives, but will also promote the further exploration of the endless potential for utilizing natural biomolecules in chiral recognition and resolution.

         <title>Hollow CeO2&#8208;Based Nanozyme with Self&#8208;Accelerated Cascade Reactions for Combined Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CeO2@ICG@GOx@HA nanozyme with self&#8208;accelerated cascade reactions achieve combined tumor treatment including photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, chemodynamic therapy and starvation therapy. CeO2@ICG@GOx@HA nanoplatform with negligible systemic toxicity not only overcomes the defects of natural enzymes and single&#8208;modal tumor therapy, but also provides an ideal combinational therapeutic treatment for tumor therapy with high efficiency.







Abstract
Nanozymes have obvious advantages in improving the efficiency of cancer treatment. However, due to the lack of tissue specificity, low catalytic efficiency, and so on, their clinical applications are limited. Herein, the nanoplatform CeO2@ICG@GOx@HA (CIGH) with self&#8208;accelerated cascade reactions is constructed. The as&#8208;prepared nanozyme shows the superior oxidase (OXD)&#8208;like, superoxide dismutase (SOD)&#8208;like, catalase (CAT)&#8208;like and peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like activities. At the same time, under 808&#8197;nm near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation, the photodynamic and photothermal capabilities are also significantly enhanced due to the presence of indocyanine green (ICG). We demonstrate that the nanozyme CIGH can efficiently accumulate in the tumor and exhibit amplified cascade antitumor effects with negligible systemic toxicity through the combination of photodynamic therapy (PDT), photothermal therapy (PTT), chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and starvation therapy. The nanozyme prepared in this study provides a promising candidate for catalytic nanomedicines for efficient tumor therapy.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review emphasizes the significant advancements made in the precise synthesis of MXenes, which is crucial for tailoring the properties of MXenes to suit specific applications. Furthermore, the review highlights the immense potential of MXene&#8208;based materials for carbon capture applications.







Abstract
MXenes, a class of two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, have garnered significant attention due to their remarkable potential for energy storage, electrocatalysis, and gas separation applications. The fabrication processes of MXene involve building up the MXene structure from constituent elements and the selective elimination of M&#8722;A bonds from the precursor MAX. However, considerable efforts are still required to design and develop efficient MXene&#8208;based technologies. This review article aims to briefly analyse the synthesis methods employed for MXene production, ranging from direct synthesis and conventional chemical wet etching approach to the more recent molten salt etching technique. The review highlights the advancements made in achieving precise control over the terminal groups, which is paramount for tailoring the properties of MXenes for specific applications. Furthermore, the potential of MXene&#8208;based materials for carbon capture applications, particularly in developing advanced adsorbents, is emphasized. The in&#8208;depth examination of MXene synthesis techniques and their implications for carbon capture applications provides a solid foundation for developing and optimizing these promising materials.

         <dc:description>
The concept described the development of a chiral acetal&#8208;based stereo&#8208;controlled degradable polymer, which was prepared via living cascade enyne metathesis polymerization with the controlled addition of highly stereodefined N,O&#8208;acetal&#8208;containing enyne monomers from Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroamination of alkoxyallene and ring&#8208;closing metathesis.







Abstract

         <title>A Phosphoramidate Prodrug Platform: One&#8208;Pot Amine Functionalization of Kinase Inhibitors with Oligoethylene Glycol for Improved Water&#8208;Solubility</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot approach is employed for the transformation of three different kinase inhibitors into oligoethylene glycol&#8208;functionalized prodrugs. These prodrugs exhibit superior solubility in water and improved cell uptake in HeLa cells. The phosphoramidate&#8208;based promoiety provides a universal platform for drugs with amine groups, enabling acid&#8208;catalyzed drug release within target cells.







Abstract
Small molecular kinase inhibitors play a key role in modern cancer therapy. Protein kinases are essential mediators in the growth and progression of cancerous tumors, rendering involved kinases an increasingly important target for therapy. However, kinase inhibitors are almost insoluble in water because of their hydrophobic aromatic nature, often lowering their availability and pharmacological efficacy. Direct drug functionalization with polar groups represents a simple strategy to improve the drug solubility, availability, and performance. Here, we present a strategy to functionalize secondary amines with oligoethylene glycol (OEG) phosphate using a one&#8208;pot synthesis in three exemplary kinase inhibiting drugs Ceritinib, Crizotinib, and Palbociclib. These OEG&#8208;prodrug conjugates demonstrate superior solubility in water compared to the native drugs, with the solubility increasing up to 190&#8208;fold. The kinase inhibition potential is only slightly decreased for the conjugates compared to the native drugs. We further show pH dependent hydrolysis of the OEG&#8208;prodrugs which releases the native drug. We observe a slow release at pH&#8197;3, while the conjugates remain stable over 96&#8197;h under physiological conditions (pH&#8197;7.4). Using confocal microscopy, we verify improved cell uptake of the drug&#8208;OEG conjugates into the cytoplasm of HeLa cells, further supporting our universal solubility approach.

         <title>The Unimolecular Decomposition Mechanism of Trimethyl Phosphate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double imaging photoelectron photo&#8208;ion coincidence spectroscopy using vacuum ultraviolet synchrotron radiation reveals the thermal decomposition mechanism of trimethyl phosphate, a fire&#8208;retardant additive candidate of lithium&#8208;ion battery electrolytes. A dimethyl ether production channel was confirmed by thermolysis experiments and quantum chemical calculations. This fundamental understanding can help the development of a chemical kinetic model and the design of better fire suppressants.







Abstract
Trimethyl phosphate (TMP), an organophosphorus compound (OPC), is a promising fire&#8208;retardant candidate for lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) electrolytes to mitigate fire spread. This study aims to understand the mechanism of TMP unimolecular thermal decomposition to support the integration of a TMP chemical kinetic model into a LIB electrolyte surrogate model. Reactive intermediates and products of TMP thermal decomposition were experimentally detected using vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) synchrotron radiation and double imaging photoelectron photoion coincidence (i2PEPICO) spectroscopy. Phosphorus&#8208;containing intermediates such as PO, HPO and HPO2 were identified. Sampling effects could successfully be obviated thanks to photoion imaging, which also showed evidence for isomerization reactions upon wall collisions in the ionization chamber. Quantum chemical calculations performed for the unimolecular decomposition of TMP revealed for the first time that isomerization channels via hydrogen and methyl transfer (barrier heights of 65.9 and 72.6&#8197;kcal/mol, respectively) are the lowest&#8208;energy primary steps of TMP decomposition followed by CH3OH/CH3/CH2O or dimethyl ether (DME) production, respectively. We found an analogous DME production channel in the unimolecular decomposition of dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP), another important OPC fire&#8208;retardant additive with a similar molecular structure to TMP, which are not included in currently available chemical kinetic models.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Petasis reaction is a powerful multi&#8208;component method for the construction of highly functionalized amines. However, this transformation is limited in that it requires a directing group on the aldehyde component and asymmetric reports are scarce. This Concept highlights key strategies for asymmetric and non&#8208;directed Petasis reactions and suggests areas in the field where further methodology advancement is needed.







Abstract
The Petasis reaction is a multicomponent reaction of aldehydes, amines and organoboron reagents and is a useful method for the construction of substituted amines. Despite the significant advancement of the Petasis reaction since its invention in 1993, strategies for asymmetric and non&#8208;directed Petasis reactions remain limited. To date, there are very few catalytic asymmetric Petasis reactions and almost all asymmetric reports employ a chiral auxiliary. Likewise, the aldehyde component often requires a directing group, ultimately limiting the reaction's scope. In this Concept, key methods for asymmetric and non&#8208;directed Petasis reactions are discussed, focusing on how these conceptual advances can be applied to solve long&#8208;standing gaps in the Petasis literature.

         <title>Clathrate Hydrates as a Kind of Promising Ice Nanoreactors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clathrate hydrates possess a variety of unique features, including the confinement effect of H&#8208;bonding nanocages, H&#8208;bond catalysis and proton/hydrogen sources, ability to enhance molecules&#8217; electron&#8208;binding and stabilizing the trapped electrons, which make clathrate hydrate promising nanoreactors.







Abstract
Since their discovery, clathrate hydrates (CHs) have received great attention both from theoretical and experimental aspects due to their great potential for gas storage and prospective applications as icy crystal materials. However, there has been limited research on the decomposition, reduction or other reactions of gases enclosed in CHs. Thanks to their unique hydrogen bonding network and cavity structures, CHs can serve as the promising nanoreactors to achieve chemical conversions, e.&#8201;g. reducing greenhouse gases. In this review&#8208;type article, we characterize the potential performance of such CHs nanoreactors by discussing their multiple functions including important roles of hydrogen bonds in CHs, e.&#8201;g. the confinement effect and proton source, and then discuss the enhanced electron&#8208;binding ability of guest molecules and the structures and properties of trapped electrons in the stacked nanocages, which contribute to our understanding of chemical reactions occurring in CHs. Finally, we provide detailed analyses of representative reaction mechanisms underwent in CH nanoreactors and effective calculational and molecular dynamics simulation methods. This review&#8208;type article aims to provide a detailed summary about the functional characteristics of CHs and reactivity in CHs, which make CHs a kind of promising icy nanoreactors.

         <title>Cationic or Neutral: Dependence of Photophysical Properties of Bis&#8208;alkynylphosphonium Pt(II) Complexes on Ancillary Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A alkynylphosphonium salts with different linker between donor and acceptor groups was used to synthesize two series of trans&#8208;bis&#8208;alkynylphosphonium Pt(II) complexes with different ancillary ligands (triphenylphosphine, P series, and cyanide, CN series). The nature of the ancillary ligand manages the overall charge and emission properties of the complexes obtained. In addition, the variation of the linker in alkynylphosphonium ligands allows fine&#8208;tuning the luminescence wavelength. Dicationic series P is unstable in solution under UV excitation, whereas in the solid state, these complexes are the first example of phosphorescent trans&#8208;phosphine&#8208;bis&#8208;alkynyl Pt(II) compounds. Neutral series CN demonstrates bright emission in solution, including dual emission for 2CN complex with biphenyl linker in alkynylphosphonium ligands. However, in the solid state for the CN series drastic decrease in the emission quantum yield compared to the P series was observed. DFT calculations reveal the complicated emission nature for the both P and CN series with various contributions of 3ILCT, 3LLCT and 3MLCT states. However, in the naphthyl&#8208;containing derivatives 3P and 3CN, the dominating 3LC character with some admixture of CT states is postulated.</dc:description>

         <title>Tripodal BODIPY&#8208;Tagged and Functional Molecular Probes: Synthesis, Computational Investigations and Explorations by Multiphoton Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on new and conjugatable tripodal compounds which open up the possibility for multiplexing with BODIPY tags for studies by confocal microscopy and 2P FLIM with structural and photochemical predictions underpinned by TD&#8208;DFT calculations.







Abstract
A range of novel BODIPY derivatives with a tripodal aromatic core was synthesized and characterized spectroscopically. These new fluorophores showed promising features as probes for in&#8197;vitro assays in live cells and offer strategic routes for further functionalization towards hybrid nanomaterials. Incorporation of biotin tags facilitated proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept access to targeted bioconjugates as molecular probes. Computational explorations using DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations identified the most stable tripodal linker conformations and predicted their absorption and emission behavior. The uptake and speciation of these molecules in living prostate cancer cells was imaged by single&#8208; and two&#8208;photon excitation techniques coupled with two&#8208;photon fluorescence lifetime imaging (2P FLIM).

         <title>Unraveling the Source of Self&#8208;Induced Diastereomeric Anisochronism&#160;in Chiral Dipeptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mastering of analytical methods for accurate quantitative determinations of enantiomeric excess is a crucial aspect in asymmetric catalysis, chiral synthesis, and pharmaceutical applications. In this context, the phenomenon of Self&#8208;Induced Diastereomeric Anisochronism&#160;(SIDA) can be exploited in NMR spectroscopy for accurate determinations of enantiomeric composition, without using a chiral auxiliary that could interfere with the spectroscopic investigation. This phenomenon can be particularly useful for improving the quantitative analysis of mixtures with low enantiomeric excesses, where direct integration of signals can be tricky.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mastering of analytical methods for accurate quantitative determinations of enantiomeric excess is a crucial aspect in asymmetric catalysis, chiral synthesis, and pharmaceutical applications. In this context, the phenomenon of Self-Induced Diastereomeric Anisochronism&#160;(SIDA) can be exploited in NMR spectroscopy for accurate determinations of enantiomeric composition, without using a chiral auxiliary that could interfere with the spectroscopic investigation. This phenomenon can be particularly useful for improving the quantitative analysis of mixtures with low enantiomeric excesses, where direct integration of signals can be tricky. Here, we describe a novel analysis protocol to correctly determine the enantiomeric composition of scalemic mixtures and investigate the thermodynamic and stereochemical features at the basis of SIDA. Dipeptide derivatives were chosen as substrates for this study, given their central role in drug design. By integrating the experiments with a conformational stochastic search that includes entropic contributions, we provide valuable information on the dimerization thermodynamics, the nature of non-covalent interactions leading to self-association, and the differences in the chemical environment responsible for the anisochrony, highlighting the importance of different stereochemical arrangement and tight association for the distinction between homochiral and heterochiral adducts.

         <dc:description>The difunctionalization of alkenes represents a powerful tool to incorporate two functional groups into the alkene bones for increasing molecular complexity and has been widely utilizations in chemical synthesis. Upon the catalysis of the green, sustainable, mild photo&#8208;/electrochemistry technologies, much attentions have been attracted to the development of new tactics for the transformations of the important alkene and alkane feedstocks driven by C&#8208;H radical functionalization.

         <title>Pnictogen&#8208;Assisted Self&#8208;Assembly As A Means To Study Mediated Thiol/Disulfide Exchange in Supramolecular Dynamic Covalent Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiol&#8208;disulfide interchange has been an active field of study for biochemists and physical organic chemists alike due to its prevalence within biological systems and fundamentally interesting dynamic nature. More recently, efforts have been made to harness the power of this reversible reaction to make self&#8208;assembling systems of macrocyclic and cage&#8208;like molecules. However, less effort has focused on the fundamental study of isolating these assemblies and analyzing the factors that control the assembly and sorting of these emerging cyclic systems. We have shown previously that pnictogen&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly enables formation of discrete disulfide macrocycles and cages without competition from polymer formation for a wide variety of alkyl thiols. Herein we report the expansion of these methods to form disulfide macrocycles from aryl thiol containing ligands, allowing access to previously unreported molecules. More importantly, the development of this new self&#8208;assembly chemistry allows for a comparison of aryl vs alkyl disulfide exchange and self&#8208;assembly. These studies complement classical physical organic and chemical biology studies on the kinetics and thermodynamics of aryl thiol oxidation to disulfides, and we show that this self&#8208;assembly method revises some prevailing wisdom from these key classical studies by providing new product distributions and new isolable products in cyclic disulfide formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Triphenylamine&#8208;based D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A Systems for Efficient Ternary WORM Memory Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The resistive switching memory behaviour of D&#8722;A architectured triphenylamine&#8208;based small organic molecules has been investigated. Conversion from binary to ternary WORM memory is achieved through fine&#8208;tuning substituents on the D&#8722;A system, which paves the way for the strategic design of molecules for developing highly efficient data storage systems.







Abstract
The impact of various substituent moieties on the molecular framework of a conjugated D&#8722;A system in resistive switching memory property has been scrutinized through an array of novel D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A molecules. The synthesized molecules with triphenylamine (TPA) as the electron donor and dicyanovinylindanone (IC) as the electron acceptor demonstrated substantial non&#8208;volatile WORM (Write&#8208;Once Read&#8208;Many) memory behaviour with appreciable ON/OFF current ratios up to 105 and a lowest recorded threshold voltage of &#8722;0.80&#8197;V. The well&#8208;balanced combination of these potent electron donating and accepting units culminated in exceptional intramolecular charge transfer interactions and minimal band gap values (1.82&#8211;2.31&#8197;eV) for the molecules, as demonstrated by photophysical and electrochemical investigations. These factors, coupled with the thin&#8208;film morphological studies, corroborated the superior performance of the fabricated devices. A longer retention time of 2000s and an endurance of 100 cycles mark the substantial stability of the memory devices. Moreover, conversion from binary to ternary WORM memory was achieved by the effective tuning of the electronic properties of the D&#8722;A systems by various substituent moieties. Molecular simulation studies revealed that the resistive switching phenomenon arises from a synergistic interplay of charge transfer and charge trapping processes within these D&#8722;A systems.
