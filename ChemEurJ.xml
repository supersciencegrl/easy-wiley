         <title>High&#8208;Valent Nickel Complexes Supported by a Functionalized PC(sp3)P Pincer Ligand: Properties and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article presents the synthesis and characterization of a series of robust high&#8208;valent organometallic nickel complexes stabilized by a functionalized PC(sp&#179;)P pincer ligand. Notably, the nickel center, covalently confined within the three&#8208;dimensional ligand framework, exhibits predictable coordination and redox behavior, coupled with remarkable stability across oxidation states +2, +3, and +4. These states were found to interconvert via one&#8208;electron transfer reactions. Among these complexes, the Ni(III)&#8208;PC(sp&#179;)P species was identified as an efficient catalyst for the mild and selective hydrosilylation of alkenes, operating through a non&#8208;oxidative mechanism that, in some cases, leads to the formation of vinyl silanes and polysilylated products. We demonstrated that, contrary to a widely accepted concept, high&#8208;valent metals can serve as viable candidates for hydrogenation catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Step&#8208;by&#8208;Step Self&#8208;Assembly of a Double&#8208;Walled Knotted Cage With Increasing Topological Complexity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two distinct intermediates with unique topologies were sequentially formed during the self&#8208;assembly of a double&#8208;walled knotted cage. These topological transformations, which are kinetically forbidden without the reversibility of coordination bonds, allow each intermediate to possess sufficiently long residence times for isolation and enable detailed time&#8208;resolved observation of multistep spontaneous transformations






.

Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly process of a double&#8208;walled cage formed from a semiflexible tripodal ligand and a Pd(II) 90&#8208;degree block was tracked by NMR and x&#8208;ray analysis. At least two intermediate structures with distinct topologies were observed prior to the formation of the final double&#8208;walled cage. By optimizing the self&#8208;assembly conditions (e.g., time, solvent, and concentration), these topological intermediates were successfully isolated and analyzed by x&#8208;ray crystallography. They are considered crucial metastable structures that navigate the shortest pathway to the final structure, demonstrating the critical role of molecular topology in guiding and controlling the kinetics of metal&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of the Photochemical Properties of Heterocyclic Hemiindigos</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis enabled the synthesis of a series of 16 novel heterocyclic hemiindigos. From this series, four compounds proved to be very interesting green and red&#8208;light&#8208;responsive hemiindigo photoswitches. The influence of heterocyclic moiety of these compounds on the absorption profiles, stability of isomers, and photoswitching properties are discussed and compared with a theoretical study.








Abstract
This study reports a series of novel heterocyclic hemiindigos (Het&#8208;HI) synthesized via the condensation of indoxyl acetate with various heteroaromatic aldehydes. The influence of electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor heterocycles on the photochemical and photophysical properties of these compounds has been investigated. Our findings reveal that several Het&#8208;HIs exhibit noteworthy photoswitching behavior, including enhanced absorption at the visible region. Notably, certain derivatives respond efficiently to green and red light, achieving good conversions to the metastable E&#8208;isomer and displaying prolonged half&#8208;lives of up to 53 days in a polar solvent. The results highlight the potential of these photoswitches for applications in molecular devices and responsive materials.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom catalysts are vital for the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides due to their&#160;Lewis acidic sites. This concept provides a concise perspective on the advancements of single&#8208;atom catalysts for CO2 cycloaddition reactions, focusing on the mechanism and catalytic driven forces. Moreover, we examine prospective advancements in the sustainable production of cyclic carbonates through CO2 cycloaddition.








Abstract
The conversion of CO2 and epoxides into cyclic carbonates represents a promising strategy for CO2 utilization and valorization, with applications spanning pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, polymer manufacturing, and energy storage. This concept article provides a concise perspective on the advancements in CO2 cycloaddition reactions catalyzed by single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), encompassing photocatalysis, thermocatalysis, and photothermal catalysis. Despite significant progress in the field, challenges such as limited catalytic activity and low stability of SACs under reaction conditions remain significant obstacles to industrial implementation. Mechanistic insights into active species are emphasized to enable the rational design and optimization of catalytic systems. In addition, key industrial challenges, such as the elimination of co&#8208;catalysts, scalability limitations, and the development of cost&#8208;effective production methods, are critically examined. By bridging fundamental research and practical applications, this concept article seeks to guide future advancements in the sustainable production of cyclic carbonates through CO2 cycloaddition.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Difunctionalization of olefins serves as the workhorse for rapid creation of molecular complexity from simple feedstocks. However, these reactions are mostly restricted to the 1,2&#8208;variant, with higher homologations being attempted to a much lesser extent. Radical translocation strategies serve as an escape from the traditional 1,2&#8208;strategies, providing a means for achieving distant functionalizations that are otherwise difficult to access. Herein, we disclose visible light&#8208;mediated strategies for the accessing of 1,3&#8208;, 1,4&#8208;, 1,5&#8208;, and 1,6&#8208;aminophosphonates via combination of various radical shifting methods. In addition, the aminophosphorylation of &#963;&#8208;bonds was also achieved, leading to 1,3&#8208;aminophosphorylated cyclobutanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Dense Li deposition and enhanced flame&#8208;retardant enabled by localized strong ion&#8208;dipole interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Uncontrolled lithium (Li) deposition can lead to the formation of dendrites and "dead" Li, accelerating the degradation of cycling stability and safety performance in lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, we propose a strategy to achieve dense Li deposition and flame&#8208;retardant by designing an electrolyte based on localized strong ion&#8208;dipole (LSID) interactions. The strong ion&#8208;dipole interactions between the multiple&#8208;dipole solvent (G4), NO3&#8208;, FSI&#8208; and Li+ promote the formation of Li+ primary solvation sheaths for stabilizing Li deposition behavior. While the weak dipole fluorine&#8208;containing diluent (TTE) is distributed in the secondary solvation sheath due to weak ion&#8208;dipole interactions of Li+&#8208;TTE to improve interfacial wettability and flame retardancy due to preferential separation. Consequently, the localized strong ion&#8208;dipole interactions strategy in the designed electrolyte successfully achieves a Coulombic efficiency of more than 99% for Li||Cu cells, and ultrathin Li&#8208;matched Li||LFP and Li||NCM523 cells also demonstrate excellent cycling stability, as well as an improved safety performance of LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Directional Macrocycle Transport, Release and Recapture enabled by a Rotaxane Transporter</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A transporter for a directional macrocycle transport, release and recapture was constructed. This was achieved using a rotaxane featuring a dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 macrocycle, dibenzylammonium (DBA)/methyl triazolium (MTA) stations on the thread and anthracene/triisopropylsilyl&#8208;acetylene stoppers, respectively. In the protonated rotaxane, the macrocycle primarily resides on the DBA station, followed by directional shuttling to the MTA station upon treatment with base. Addition of fluoride as an additional chemical input cleaves the triisopropylsilyl stopper, leading to release of the macrocycle and the half&#8208;thread into solution. The released macrocycle can be recaptured by protonation, and the mechanical bond can be reestablished via CuAAC click reaction, enabled by the terminal acetylene unit on the half&#8208;thread. This generates an elongated second generation rotaxane transporter, which was used for a second cycle of directional macrocycle transport and release, proving the possibility of an iterative operation of the rotaxane&#8208;transporter in this molecular design.</dc:description>

         <title>Utilization of a Chelating Bis[(dialkylamino)cyclopropenimine] to Isolate a Series of Heavier Zero&#8208;Valent Group 14 Tetracarbonyl Iron Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the utilization of the ethylene&#8208;bridged bis[(dialkylamino)cyclopropenimine] (bisCPI) ligand, LCPI, to give access to new main&#8208;group E(II) halide complexes (E = Ge, Sn, Pb; 1, 2, 3). Subsequent reduction with Collman&#8217;s reagent (Na2Fe(CO)4 &#8226; dioxane) enables the isolation of a series of monoatomic zero&#8208;valent tetrylone&#8208;tetracarbonyl iron complexes, (LCPI)E(Fe(CO)4 (E = Ge (4), Sn (5), Pb (6)). Compounds 4 &#8208; 6 were reacted further with iron pentacarbonyl to yield the bis&#8208;tetracarbonyl iron complexes (LCPI)E[(Fe(CO)4]2 (E = Ge (7), Sn (8), Pb (9)). The electronic structure of these complexes was studied by 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and computationally by density functional theory calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>TiNiSi&#8208;Type ALiAu (A = Ca, Sr, Ba, Eu, Yb) Compounds: Alternative Use of &#8220;Excess&#8221; Electrons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excess electrons distinguish the bonding in ALiAu (A = Yb, Ca, Eu, Sr, Ba), a new series of intermetallic compounds crystallizing in TiNiSi type. According to bonding analysis, these metallic phases are classified as aurides containing polycations with multiatomic bonding between A, Li, and Au






.

Abstract
New TiNiSi&#8208;type compounds ALiAu (A = Ca, Sr, Ba, Eu, Yb) were obtained in the form of mm&#8208;sized single crystals by high&#8208;temperature centrifugation&#8208;aided filtration from lithium melt. They are the first examples of TiNiSi&#8208;type representatives containing Li and a transition metal. The metallic phases show paramagnetic (Ca) or diamagnetic (Sr, Ba, Yb) behavior or antiferromagnetic ordering below 19 K (Eu). A new structural description is based on a hexagonal close packing with A occupying all octahedral and Li occupying half of the tetrahedral voids in an ordered fashion. Chemical bonding analysis supports the structural description and reveals the formation of eight&#8208;atomic stella&#8211;quadrangula bonds pinned on the empty tetrahedral holes, a bonding picture known from elemental metals.

         <title>The Dinuclear Zirconocene Complex [(Cp2Zr)2(&#956;&#8208;Me)(&#956;&#8208;C2Ph)] as a Platform for Small Molecule Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reported dinuclear zirconocene alkynyl methyl complex represents a multifaceted platform for the activation of small molecules. While reduction reactions furnish unusual di&#8208; and trinuclear hydride complexes, reactions with nitriles result in coordination and reduction of the substrate. Detailed structural and computational analysis gives insights into the structure and bonding of these species.








Abstract
The dinuclear title compound [(Cp2Zr)2(&#956;&#8208;Me)(&#956;&#8208;C2Ph)] 5 was prepared from a zirconocene alkynyl methyl complex and Rosenthal's zirconocene source [Cp2Zr(py)(&#951;2&#8208;Me3SiC2SiMe3)] in a formal comproportionation reaction. This complex shows catalytic activity for the dehydrocoupling of amine boranes, with a dinuclear hydride&#8208;bridged alkynyl complex 6 being formed as a catalytically relevant species. The structure of this complex was confirmed for the first time by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. The reaction of complex 5 with hydrogen results in hydrogenation of the alkynyl ligand, yielding a highly labile trinuclear hydride&#8208;bridged complex as a possible intermediate of zirconocene dihydride/ethylbenzene formation. This complex shows an unusual distorted planar tetracoordinate environment at the central carbon atom positioned between the three Zr centers. The reaction of complex 5 with 2&#8208;cyanopyridine and acetonitrile is characterized by a reduction of the substrates. The herein reported reactivity of complex 5 demonstrates the remarkable potential of well&#8208;established dinuclear zirconocenes to stabilize unusual bond situations, which were analyzed comprehensively using spectroscopic, structural, and computational methods.

&lt;p&gt;The dinuclear title compound [(Cp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Zr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-Me)(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ph)] &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; was prepared from a zirconocene alkynyl methyl complex and Rosenthal's zirconocene source [Cp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Zr(py)(&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)] in a formal comproportionation reaction. This complex shows catalytic activity for the dehydrocoupling of amine boranes, with a dinuclear hydride-bridged alkynyl complex &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; being formed as a catalytically relevant species. The structure of this complex was confirmed for the first time by single-crystal X-ray analysis. The reaction of complex &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; with hydrogen results in hydrogenation of the alkynyl ligand, yielding a highly labile trinuclear hydride-bridged complex as a possible intermediate of zirconocene dihydride/ethylbenzene formation. This complex shows an unusual distorted planar tetracoordinate environment at the central carbon atom positioned between the three Zr centers. The reaction of complex &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; with 2-cyanopyridine and acetonitrile is characterized by a reduction of the substrates. The herein reported reactivity of complex &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; demonstrates the remarkable potential of well-established dinuclear zirconocenes to stabilize unusual bond situations, which were analyzed comprehensively using spectroscopic, structural, and computational methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulation of Optical and Electrochemical Properties of Cu(I) Alkynyl Clusters by Carboxylic Acid Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inclusion of carboxylic acid ligands significantly impacts the structural arrangement of the metal core in Cu(I) alkynyl clusters, thereby affecting their fluorescence properties. Furthermore, the incorporation of ferrocene into these clusters has been noted to induce modifications in the electrochemical performance of the Cu(I) alkynyl clusters.








Abstract
Surface ligands play a pivotal role in the functional design of atomically precise Cu(I) nanoclusters. They act as protective agents, ensuring the stability of the Cu(I) clusters, while also influencing their structure and properties. This study delves into the synthesis, structure, and properties of innovative Cu(I) nanoclusters co&#8208;stabilized by carboxylic acid and alkynyl ligands. The findings reveal that these surface ligands wield a significant impact on the cluster's structure and can even modulate the luminescent characteristics of the Cu(I) alkynyl clusters. Moreover, density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations shed light on how different carboxylic acid ligands affect the UV&#8208;visible absorptivity of paired Cu(I) clusters. In addition, ferrocene carboxylic acids were employed as protective ligands to impart electrochemical properties to the Cu(I) clusters. This research presents an effective methodology for synthesizing atomically precise Cu(I) clusters shielded by carboxylic acid ligands.

         <title>Supramolecular Matter Through Crystal Engineering: Covalent Bond Formation to Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular chemistry can transform organic synthesis by revealing that crystalline materials are not static but rather dynamic environments for controlled covalent bond formations and manipulations. This review focuses on how supramolecular chemistry can be developed to direct molecular synthesis in the organic solid state, directing reliable C&#8208;C bond formations to enable transformations difficult or impossible in solution. Special attention is given to post&#8208;synthetic modifications that serve to broaden the functional scope of solid&#8208;state reactivity allowing organic crystals to be developed as molecular flasks and a form of supramolecular matter.

         <title>Multifunctional Alternating Copolymer Nanoflower Iodine Hosts for Long&#8208;Term Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) batteries are considered to be potential energy storage systems due to their safety, environmental friendliness and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the shuttle effect of polyiodide leads to cathode active mass loss and anode Zn corrosion, which greatly reduces the cycle life of Zn&#8208;I2 batteries. Herein, we report an N&#8208;modified alternating copolymer nanoflower composite (NH&#8208;NFs&#8208;PDA) as a new type of iodine host candidate to effectively inhibit the polyiodide shuttle effect in Zn&#8208;I2 battery. As a result, the NH&#8208;NFs&#8208;PDA/I2&#8208;based Zn&#8208;I2 battery demonstrates a high specific capacity of 185.42 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1 A g&#8208;1, with a coulombic efficiency of 99%. Moreover, it exhibits excellent cycling stability, achieving 10000 cycles at 10 A g&#8208;1 with an average capacity decay rate of only 0.0008% per cycle, ranking it among the best&#8208;performing polymeric host&#8208;based Zn&#8208;I&#8322; batteries in the literature. Density functional theory (DFT) and in&#8208;situ ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV&#8208;Vis) measurements illustrate the impressive suppression of polyiodide shuttle effect comes from the strong interaction between N&#8208;modification enhanced polyhydroxy sites in NH&#8208;NFs&#8208;PDA and polyiodide. This work may shed new light on the design of advanced polymeric iodine hosts in Zn&#8208;I&#8322; batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Chalcogen Vacancies as Key Drivers of Distinct Physicochemistry in MoS2, MoSe2, and MoTe2 for Selective Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals that chalcogen vacancies not only enhance the surface reactivity of Mo&#8208;based TMD monolayers &#8211; MoS2, MoSe2, and MoTe2 &#8211; but also amplify differences in their physicochemical properties, leading to distinct surface interactions. This effect originates from the intrinsic characteristics of Mo&#8211;X bonding in these monolayers.







Abstract
The catalytic performance of Mo&#8208;based transition&#8208;metal&#8208;dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers is intrinsically tied to their physicochemical properties. However, the limited chemical diversity among these materials constrains their versatility for key catalytic processes, including carbon dioxide (CRR), nitrogen (NRR), and oxygen (ORR) reduction reactions. This study employs density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the impact of chalcogen vacancies on the properties of 

MoS2

 ${{\rm{MoS}}_2 }$



, 

MoSe2

 ${{\rm{MoSe}}_2 }$



, and 

MoTe2

 ${{\rm{MoTe}}_2 }$



, focusing on the adsorption behaviors of CO, NO, and 

NO2

 ${{\rm{NO}}_2 }$



. The findings reveal that chalcogen vacancies not only enhance surface reactivity but also impart distinctive physicochemical characteristics to each TMD. These effects arise from intrinsic bonding differences, resulting in distinct charge availability at exposed Mo atoms and variations in vacancy dimensions, which shape specific surface interactions. Hence, while adsorption differences between pristine surfaces are generally negligible for catalysis, vacancies amplify them by over an order of magnitude, resulting in pronounced material&#8208;specific behaviors. Moreover, varying vacancy dimensions affect how species incorporate into defects, further enhancing the differences. These characteristics unlock substantial potential of TMD sheets for distinct surface chemistries, transforming them from relatively similar to markedly different as defect density rises. Consequently, our findings provide insights for tailoring these materials toward applications in electro&#8208; and photocatalysis.

Bioorthogonal functionalization in the minor groove of DNA with 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine as target is performed. Cyclopropene and heptene embedded in 2&#8208;amino protecting groups serve as dienophiles and 3,6&#8208;dipyridyl&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine as diene in inverse&#8208;electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder reactions. Pyridazine adducts attached to the 2&#8208;position of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine by a long linker are well&#8208;accomodated in the minor groove of DNA.








Abstract
Bioorthogonal functionalization in the minor groove of DNA with protected 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA, 1) as a target site is described. Cyclopropene and heptene as part of 2&#8208;aminoacyl protecting groups served as dienophiles in inverse&#8208;electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder (iEDDA) reactions with 3,6&#8208;dipyridyl&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine as diene. For the purpose, bis&#8208;protection of 1 with cyclopropenyl and heptenoyl groups was conducted. Selective removal of the 6&#8208;amino protecting groups gave mono&#8208;protected 1. 2&#8208;Amino&#8208;dA pyridazine conjugates were accessed by iEDDA cycloaddition with tetrazine. Second order rate constants disclosed faster reaction kinetics for cyclopropenyl than for heptenoyl 2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA. To access protected oligonucleotides, phosphoramidites prepared from bis&#8208;protected 2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA were used in standard solid&#8208;phase synthesis. 2&#8208;Amino protecting groups were retained using mild deprotection conditions. Hybridization experiments disclosed increased duplex stability when protected 2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA&#8208;dT pairs replaced 1&#8208;dT pairs. Mismatch discrimination of cyclopropenyl and heptenoyl 2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA was superior to 2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA. iEDDA reactions on protected oligonucleotides furnished oligonucleotide pyridazine conjugates. In base pairs with dT, 2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA pyridazine conjugates connected by a short rigid cyclopropenyl ring led to reduced thermal stability, whereas pyridazine conjugates attached by a long flexible linker retained duplex stability. The findings of this investigation pave the way for functionalization and labelling in the minor groove of DNA using copper free iEDDA cycloaddition.

         <title>Integration of Ultrasmall Pt Clusters With Silanol Groups in Pure Silica Zeolites for Robust Formaldehyde Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafine Pt nanoclusters encapsulated within silicalite&#8208;1 zeolite were synthesized for formaldehyde oxidation at room temperature. The synergistic effect of Pt and adjacent silanol nests plays a key role in enhancing catalytic activity. The catalyst achieves complete formaldehyde removal even at 0.1 wt% Pt loading, with exceptional stability and water resistance, making it a promising solution for indoor air purification.








Abstract
Formaldehyde (HCHO) is a major indoor air pollutant that poses serious health risks. Catalytic oxidation of HCHO to CO2 and H2O at room temperature offers an efficient solution. Supported Pt nanoparticles are the most efficient catalysts, but challenges such as high cost and water resistant, limit their widespread application. Herein, we employ a ligand&#8208;protected direct hydrogen reduction strategy to encapsulate ultrafine Pt clusters within hydrophobic silicalite&#8208;1 zeolite. Cs&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, x&#8208;ray absorption, and solid nuclear magnetic resonance measurements confirmed that the Pt clusters are stabilized within zeolite channels by adjacent silanol groups. The optimized Pt@S&#8208;1&#8208;400H catalyst achieved complete HCHO removal at room temperature, with even low Pt loading of 0.1 wt%, affording a high specific activity of 171.9 molHCHO&#183;molPt&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1, representing the top level among all state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt&#8208;based catalysts. Significantly, the hydrophobic nature of silicalite&#8208;1 ensures excellent water resistance and long&#8208;term stability for the Pt@S&#8208;1&#8208;400H catalyst. In situ infrared spectroscopy reveals that silanol sites facilitate HCHO adsorption and the formation of formate intermediates. The synergistic effect between Pt clusters and adjacent silanol sites enhances the HCHO oxidation performance. The simple and cost&#8208;effective approach, combined with its excellent activity and stability, holds significant potential for effectively eliminating indoor pollutants in practical applications.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence Inversion Induced by Achiral Dyes in Organogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular assembly strategy is widely applied to develop circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials, especially for centrally chiral system. The CPL sign of supramolecular gels based on centrally chiral compound is generally regulated by employing the opposite chiral enantiomers. However, controlling CPL signals by regulating interaction model between achiral fluorophore with chiral gelator, accompanied by the adjustment of the emission wavelength, remains challenging. Herein, we have developed binary supramolecular gels based on achiral cyanostilbene derivatives and a chiral gelator. Two binary supramolecular gels have displayed achiral fluorophore&#8208;induced CPL sign inversion, attributing to the hydrogen bonding interaction between the carboxyl group of two fluorophores and the amino group of chiral gelator. This work reveals a rational approach to the design of CPL material with tunable CPL sign.</dc:description>

         <title>A Lewis Base&#8208;Free Trialumane: Enhanced Electrophilicity Based on Consecutive Vacant Orbitals Over Three Aluminum Atoms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Lewis base&#8208;free trialumane having a 2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl (Tip) substituent was synthesized by a reaction of alumanyl anion with TipAlBr2. The structure, bonding, and electronic properties of the Tip&#8208;substituted trialumane were estimated by NMR spectra, X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, DFT calculations, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra, and electrochemical study to reveal its two consecutive Al&#8211;Al covalent bonds and overlapped vacant orbitals of three Al atoms. Chemical reduction of Tip&#8208;substituted trialumane gave a series of alumanyl anions via the cleavage of the Al&#8211;Al bonds. This study shows the low&#8208;lying characteristic LUMO that consists of vacant orbitals of three Al atoms in the base&#8208;free trialumane.</dc:description>

         <title>Bis(dipyrrinate) Based Bis(germylenes): Synthesis, Reactivity, and UV&#8208;Vis Spectroscopic Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first examples of air and water stable bis(germylenes) 5&#8211;9 and bis(germacarbonyl) compounds 10&#8211;12 are reported. Bis(germylene monochloride) 5 is isolated by starting from bis(dipyrromethene) 4, which in turn has been synthesized by oxidizing bis(dipyrromethane) 3 using DDQ. Terephthaldehyde 1 and mesityl pyrrole 2 were the precursors for compound 3.

         <title>Catechol&#8208;functionalized Covalent Organic Framework: Synthesis, Characterization and Metal&#8208;free Organocatalyst for CO2 Fixation under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) incorporating hydrogen bond donor (HBD) moieties show great promise for heterogeneous catalyst for CO2 cycloaddition. In this work, a catechol&#8208;functionalized COF (BL&#8208;TF&#8208;COF) was constructed via Schiff&#8208;base condensation under solvothermal conditions, which was characterized using PXRD, FT&#8208;IR, solid&#8208;state 13C NMR, SEM, HR&#8208;TEM, DRS and CV. BL&#8208;TF&#8208;COF presents high crystallinity, large BET surface area (523 m2 g&#8208;1) and remarkable chemical stability, along with abundant hydroxyl functional groups distributed on the pore wall. This framework shows a CO2 adsorption capacity up to 88 mg g&#8208;1 at 273 K and 1 bar. The binding locations of the adsorption of CO2 over BL&#8208;TF&#8208;COF was studied by grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations. BL&#8208;TF&#8208;COF displays remarkable catalytic performance for the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides under mild conditions. Under the condition of the epichlorohydrin/tetrabutylammonium bromide/BL&#8208;TF&#8208;COF molar ratio of 10210:630:4, the system achieved 62.5% substrate conversion at 25&#176;C under atmospheric CO2 pressure (1 bar) within 48 h. Mechanistic insights into epoxide adsorption and activation processes were investigated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Switchable Rings and Chains in Dynamic Covalent Imine Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of a visible&#8208;light switchable azobenzene A with aliphatic diamines X of variable chain lengths gives access to various macrocyclic isomers. While diamines with even numbers of methylene groups exclusively create Z,Z&#8208;A2X2&#8208;type macrocycles, both Z,Z&#8208; and E,E&#8208;A2X2&#8208;type macrocycles are accessible starting from odd&#8208;numbered diamines. This study gives a deepened overview of the accessibility of macrocyclic isomers governed by a rational even&#8211;odd alteration of simple diamines.








Abstract
The self&#8208;assembliy of red&#8208;light switchable, functionalised ortho&#8208;difluoroazobenzene isomers E&#8208;/Z&#8208;A with aliphatic diamines exhibits an alternating match/mismatch behaviour depending on the diamine's chain length. While even&#8208;numbered diamines exclusively form imine macrocycles with the Z&#8208;configured azobenzene isomer, odd&#8208;numbered diamines form photoswitchable, defined macrocycles. The formation of Z,Z&#8208;A2X2&#8208;type macrocycles was demonstrated with butane&#8208;1,4&#8208; (B) and hexane&#8208;1,6&#8208;diamine (H), while additionally E,E&#8208;A2X2&#8208;type macrocycles were obtained with propane&#8208;1,3&#8208; (Pr), pentane&#8208;1,5&#8208;diamine (Pe), and diethylene glycol bisamine (O), validated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures of E,E&#8208;A2Pr2 and E,E&#8208;A2O2. The observed reactivity differences arise from the preferred conformations of the flexible diamines in solution, which alternate predictably with odd and even numbers of methylene groups, investigated by 19F&#8208;DOSY NMR experiments, MALDI&#8208;MS measurements, and UV/Vis spectroscopy. These findings provide detailed insight into photoresponsive self&#8208;assembled systems and highlight the potential of azobenzenes in dynamic covalent chemistry, offering new opportunities for controlling structure and function in adaptive materials.

         <title>Mediated Electrochemical Oxidation of Nucleosides to Their 5&#8242;&#8208;Carboxylic Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sweet oxidation method: A mediated electrochemical oxidation method has been developed that enables selective oxidation of the nucleosides and ribosugars to afford the 5&#8242;&#8208;carboxylic acid derivatives. The method tolerates each of the nucleobases and various protecting group variations.








Abstract
Nucleoside 5&#8242;&#8208;carboxylic acids are important synthetic targets, but most existing methods to access these compounds use (super)stoichiometric chemical oxidants to oxidize the primary alcohol. The present study introduces an aminoxyl&#8208;mediated electrochemical method for oxidation of nucleosides and ribosugars to afford their 5&#8242;&#8208;carboxylic acid derivatives. The optimized conditions employ 4&#8208;acetamido&#8208;2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine 1&#8208;oxyl (ACT) as the aminoxyl mediator in a water/acetonitrile solvent mixture with tetraethylammonium bicarbonate or monohydrogen phosphate as a base within an undivided electrolysis cell. The reaction tolerates diverse functionality at the nucleobase and sugar positions and is showcased in the oxidation of 10 different substrates, including a 10 g scale oxidation of 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;methylcytidine.

         <title>Polyacrylamide&#8208;Grafted MXenes Prepared via On&#8208;Surface Polymerization Demonstrated Enhanced Aqueous Dispersion and Colloidal Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a novel type of two&#8208;dimensional materials, MXenes demonstrated great potentials for biomedical applications due to their excellent photothermal and photodynamic properties. However, their exposed unmodified surface cannot ensure sufficient stability for MXene in biological environment. Here, we developed an efficient method to modify the surface of MXenes in aqueous medium. A water&#8208;soluble initiator was designed and covalently anchored onto MXene surfaces, which was used to initiate copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed atom transfer radical polymerization to introduce a layer of water soluble polyacrylamide on MXene surfaces (PAM&#8208;MXenes). Impressively, it was found that the grafting of the polymer layer on MXene surfaces greatly enhanced the colloidal stability of modified MXenes which keep well dispersed in cell culture medium for over 7 days and for over one month in water without aggregation or sedimentation. Furthermore, their photothermal properties were not influenced as the PAM&#8208;MXenes demonstrated uncompromised heat&#8208;generating capacities upon irradiation at 808 nm nor did they cause marked toxicity to cells. This was the first reported example of directly growing polymer chains from the MXene surfaces. Thus, our work provided an effective approach to ameliorate the surface properties of MXene materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Organization of Carbohydrate&#8208;Derived Amphiphilic Compounds: Insights into Their Supramolecular Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and complete characterization of two carbohydrate&#8208;derived amphiphiles are described. Dynamic light scattering and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering confirmed the formation of reverse micelles with low polydispersity indices in two biocompatible solvents, while in toluene, reverse vesicles were detected.








Abstract
This study describes the synthesis and self&#8208;assembly properties of two sugar&#8208;derived surfactants constructed by click reaction from readily accessible building blocks. After structural characterization, their self&#8208;assembly processes were studied in two biocompatible solvents, isopropyl myristate and methyl laurate, as well as in toluene. Detailed experiments by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) confirmed the formation of reverse micelles (RMs). The findings reveal the formation of spherical aggregates with low polydispersity indices, indicating a high degree of size uniformity. SAXS analysis further demonstrated that these aggregates possess a smooth and well&#8208;defined RMs&#8208;nonpolar solvent interface. Notably, the system in toluene as the non&#8208;polar phase exhibited a unique behavior, suggesting distinct structural characteristics that differ from those observed in the biocompatible solvents. A low&#8208;resolution structural model revealed that the aggregates contain an internal gap compatible with a reverse vesicle consisting of a bilayer of amphiphile with the hydrophilic heads pointing towards the interior and the exterior of the bilayer with toluene on both sides of the bilayer. In summary, this study explores the self&#8208;assembly characteristics of sugar&#8208;based surfactants in non&#8208;polar environments that mimic biological membranes. The findings highlight the significant potential of these surfactants in supramolecular chemistry and glycobiology.

&lt;p&gt;This study describes the synthesis and self-assembly properties of two sugar-derived surfactants constructed by click reaction from readily accessible building blocks. After structural characterization, their self-assembly processes were studied in two biocompatible solvents, isopropyl myristate and methyl laurate, as well as in toluene. Detailed experiments by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) confirmed the formation of reverse micelles (RMs). The findings reveal the formation of spherical aggregates with low polydispersity indices, indicating a high degree of size uniformity. SAXS analysis further demonstrated that these aggregates possess a smooth and well-defined RMs-nonpolar solvent interface. Notably, the system in toluene as the non-polar phase exhibited a unique behavior, suggesting distinct structural characteristics that differ from those observed in the biocompatible solvents. A low-resolution structural model revealed that the aggregates contain an internal gap compatible with a reverse vesicle consisting of a bilayer of amphiphile with the hydrophilic heads pointing towards the interior and the exterior of the bilayer with toluene on both sides of the bilayer.

         <title>Photoinduced Stable Circularly Polarized Luminescent Radicals From a Triphenylamine&#8208;Attached Planar Chiral Pillar[5]arene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoinduced organic radicals with unique luminescent properties are highly sought&#8208;after due to their important prospects in synthetic chemistry and materials science. However, the current development of organic free radicals, including photoinduced ones, is significantly limited and faces challenges related to stability and poor luminescence behavior. Taking advantage of the photoelectric activity of triarylamine, we herein describe an unusual luminescent radical, which can be rapidly generated by UV&#8208;irradiation of a solid&#8208;state triarylamine&#8208;functionalized &#960;&#8208;conjugated pillar[5]arene (EtP5NN) in air, accompanied by luminescent color switching from bluish&#8208;violet to sky&#8208;blue. The persistent radicals within EtP5NN with a half&#8208;life of 12.7 hours suggest that the pillar[5]arene&#8208;skeleton straightforwardly improves the stability of radicals. The sterically bulky triarylamine groups inhibits the racemization of planar chiral pillar[5]arene, and allows the optical resolution of this system. The enhancement of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is triggered by UV&#8208;irradiation of the enantiomers (pS/pR&#8208;EtP5NN) in the solid state.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular dynamics of high&#8208;pressure liquid water: Going from ambient to near&#8208;critical temperatures.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The properties of high&#8208;pressure liquid water were investigated along the isobar of 25 MPa and in the temperature range 298.15&#8208;623.15 K using classical molecular dynamics simulations. Particular attention has been given to the changes in the local structural and related dynamic properties of liquid water. The results obtained have revealed noticeable changes in the shape of the calculated radial distribution functions, as well as the existence of local extrema or crossovers in several structural descriptors and entropic quantities at temperatures around 423.15 K and 498.15 K, where also significant changes in the hydrogen bond network of liquid water have also been observed. The temperature dependence of translational, reorientational and hydrogen bond dynamics of liquid water has also been investigated by calculating the translational self&#8208;diffusion and the corresponding O&#8208;H vector Legendre reorientational correlation times and hydrogen bond lifetimes. The corresponding activation energies for each investigated relaxation process have also been presented and discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>In Pursuit of Carbon Neutrality: Progresses and Innovations in Sorbents for Direct Air Capture of CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct air capture (DAC) is of immense current interest, as a means to facilitate CO2 capture at low concentrations (~400 ppm) directly from the atmosphere, with the aim to address global warming caused by excessive anthropogenic CO2 production. Traditionally, DAC of CO2 has relied on amine scrubbing and metal carbonate /hydroxide solutions. However, recent years have seen notable progress in DAC sorbents, with key advancements aimed at improving efficiency, capacity, and regenerability while reducing energy consumption. This review delivers an exhaustive analysis of contemporary developments in DAC sorbents, addressing the innovations in material design and consequent performance enhancement. The limitations of the sorbents have also been discussed, with future perspectives for improving sustainable CO2 capture strategies. We anticipate that this overview will help lay the groundwork for further development and largescale implementation of sustainable sorbents and cutting&#8208;edge technologies towards attaining carbon neutrality.</dc:description>

         <title>Ab Initio Study on Doped Cu138X2 Nanoparticles with dispersed surface active sites for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit significant potential in electrocatalysis owing to their tunable electronic structure and abundant surface&#8208;active sites. However, the multifaceted complexity of Cu&#8208;based nanoparticles induced by heteroatom dopants fundamentally limits our ability to decipher the nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia electroreduction (NO3RR) mechanism, creating a critical knowledge gap that obstructs the targeted engineering of advanced catalysts with atomic precision. In this study, we employed first&#8208;principles calculations to design a series of highly surface&#8208;dispersed transition metal&#8208;doped Cu138X2 (X = Ag, Au, Pd, Zn) bimetallic electrocatalysts for nitrate reduction to ammonia, based on the structure of Cu140 NPs. Theoretical analysis revealed that Cu138Au2 exhibits significant advantages in NO3RR, with a remarkably low limiting potential of &#8208;0.20 eV. Additionally, significant energy barriers were observed for the formation of by&#8208;products NO and NO2 on Cu138Au2, ensuring high selectivity towards ammonia. For Cu&#8208;based catalysts, we propose that the *NO2 &#8594; *HNO2 step is critical and can serve as a descriptor for rapid screening of Cu&#8208;based catalysts. This study not only provides important insights into the research of Cu NPs as NO3RR electrocatalysts but also establishes a theoretical foundation for enhancing their catalytic performance through surface modification or compositional tuning.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8220;Living Detergents&#8221;: An In Situ Detergent Tailoring Strategy for Efficient Membrane Protein Stabilization and Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Detergents are essential molecular tools for membrane protein (MP) research, yet traditional detergents with static properties often fail to address the diverse and evolving needs of MP studies. To this end, this study introduces &#8220;living detergents&#8221;, an innovative class of detergents equipped with functional tags that enable biorthogonal modifications with externally introduced structural elements. This approach allows for not only the parallel generation of new detergents, but also in situ tuning of MP samples within freshly formed detergents. The efficacy of this strategy was demonstrated through the rapid identification of optimal detergents for high&#8208;quality electron microscopy studies of A2AAR. Overall, this flexible and robust platform enables efficient tailoring of detergents, advancing the exploration of detergent structure&#8208;function relationships in MP research and opening pathways for more specialized solutions for diverse experimental demands.</dc:description>

         <title>A Self&#8208;Sustaining Supramolecular (Auto)Photocatalysis via the Synthesis of N&#8208;Vinylacetamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efforts to enhance photocatalysts prioritize improving their accessibility and practicality in photocatalytic applications. Supramolecular (auto)photocatalysis, which exploits transient self&#8208;assembled complexes, facilitates visible light&#8208;driven reactions, with autocatalytic systems promoting sustainable and atom&#8208;economical processes. In this study, the photocatalyst Mes&#8208;Acr&#8208;MeClO4, typically active under blue light, formed a dark red charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complex with N&#8208;bromoacetamide (NBA) in the presence of K2CO3 in DCE, enabling green&#8208;light photocatalysis. This self&#8208;assembled CT complex initiated an auto&#8208;photocatalytic process via two&#8208;photon absorption, generating an N&#8208;centered radical that drove anti&#8208;Markovnikov, syn&#8208;periplanar addition to phenylacetylene, achieving exclusive Z&#8208;selective formation of (Z)&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;phenylvinyl)acetamide. Interestingly, the product itself functioned as a potent green&#8208;LED photocatalyst (&#955;em ~518 nm, &#964; ~10 ns), driving its own synthesis with added terminal alkynes. With 100% atom economy, this work highlights a system chemistry approach, showcasing a highly efficient, self&#8208;sustaining catalytic process that advances green and sustainable synthetic strategies. This protocol emphasizes sustainability with an outstanding E&#8208;factor of 11.15, reflecting minimal waste production (11.15 kg per 1 kg of product) and demonstrating a strong commitment to green chemistry principles.</dc:description>

         <title>Homogeneous Coating of Al&#8208;Doped Spinel Oxides on Ni Mesh for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Industrial alkaline water electrolysis requires catalyst electrode with high alkaline resistance and scalability due to the high alkaline concentration, frequent gas desorption, and high hydrogen production power involved. However, most high&#8208;performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are poorly adhered to conductive substrates, such as nickel foam or carbon paper, leading to detachment and performance degradation under harsh industrial conditions. Here, we report a simple and scalable strategy of "immersion&#8211;infrared drying&#8211;calcination" to fabricate Al&#8208;doped spinel oxides in situ grown on mechanically robust Ni mesh. By further simple cation substitution, we effectively modulate the metal&#8211;oxygen bond length in the octahedral center and the valence state of active sites, significantly enhancing OER activity. Electrochemical tests (1 M KOH, 25 &#176;C) show that NiAl0.5Co1.5O4 exhibits excellent performance with an overpotential of 234 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2. Remarkably, under industrial conditions (6 M KOH, 60 &#176;C), it achieves an overpotential of only 448 mV at a current density of 400 mA cm&#8208;2, which is superior to that of commercial Raney Ni catalysts. Moreover, the scalable electrode demonstrates excellent resistance to concentrated alkaline solutions and high current densities.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>1&#8208;Indanone derivatives are efficiently synthesized via a radical cyclization reaction of 1,6&#8208;enynes, using TBHP as both oxidant and reactant, in the presence of Cu(I) as the catalyst and 4&#8208;methyl benzoic acid as the cocatalyst. Notably, in the absence of 4&#8208;methyl benzoic acid, the reaction undergoes a dramatic shift in product selectivity, yielding 1H&#8209;cyclopropa[b]naphthalene&#8208;2,7&#8208;diones exclusively under the same conditions, with Cu(I) acting as the sole catalyst. This transformation offers key advantages, including operational simplicity, cost&#8208;effective and readily available materials, scalability to gram quantities, and compatibility with a wide range of functional groups.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The colors of substances and emission are determined by the width of the energy gap between frontier molecular orbitals. In general, significant structural transformation or chemical modification is essential to tune the energy gap. Herein, we reveal a hypervalent silicon compound can form both square pyramidal (SP) and trigonal bipyramidal (TBP) geometries and demonstrate a novel technique to modulate the energy gap of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system. The energy gap in the TBP geometry is narrower than that in the SP geometry owing to stronger contribution of a polarized three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8208;4e) bond and a nitrogen&#8211;silicon (N&#8722;Si) coordination, and the geometries are changeable by external stimuli such as photoirradiation and temperature variations. Correspondingly, the emission bands in the orange (&#955;PL = 640 nm) and yellow (&#955;PL = 579 nm) regions were observed from the TBP geometry at room temperature and the SP geometry at &#8722;196 &#176;C, respectively. Furthermore, the geometry can be fixed to the TBP geometry by introducing bulky substituents at silicon. These mechanisms are experimentally and theoretically clarified in detail. Our findings described here are expected to be a novel molecular design for creating stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Self&#8208;Ion Exchange Mechanism in Na2Mn3O7 for Enhanced Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work investigates the Mn&#8208;based cathode material Na2Mn3O7, synthesized using a sol&#8211;gel method. A self&#8208;ion exchange reaction in Na2Mn3O7 drives the phase transition to ZnMn3O73H2O before electrochemical cycling in ZnSO4&#8211;based electrolyte. The resulting hydrated ZnMn3O7&#183;3H2O phase incorporates Zn2+ ions and H2O molecules, stabilizing the lattice and improving Zn&#8208;ion battery performance with a reversible capacity of &#8764;240 mAhg&#8722;1.








Abstract
Manganese&#8208;based cathode materials have attracted significant interest in zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) due to their high theoretical capacity, affordability, and environmentally friendly nature. Recently, Na2Mn3O7 (NMO) has emerged as a promising electrode material for ZIBs owing to its unique triclinic crystal structure, which consists of infinite parallel [Mn3O7]2&#8315; layers. This layered framework includes a vacancy at one of the seven Mn sites, which plays a crucial role in facilitating the insertion and accommodation of incoming Zn2+ ions. This structural feature allows for efficient zinc intercalation, transforming NMO into a Zn&#8211;Mn&#8208;based system electrochemically. In this study, the focus is on investigating the mechanism of self&#8208;ion exchange occurring in NMO, utilizing an electrolyte composed of 2&#160;M ZnSO4 and 0.1&#160;M MnSO4, exhibiting a reversible capacity of &#8764;240 mAh g&#8722;1 at a C/10 rate with a Coulombic efficiency of &#8764;99%. The self&#8208;ion exchange mechanism and structural changes during the battery operation were investigated using ex&#8208;situ x&#8208;ray diffraction and x&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. The reversible phase transformations between hydrated and partially dehydrated states suggest a robust mechanism for Zn2+ ion insertion and extraction, contributing to the stability and performance of the Zn&#8211;Mn electrode material in ZIB applications.

In this study, the focus is on investigating the mechanism of self-ion exchange occurring in NMO, utilizing an electrolyte composed of 2&#160;M ZnSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and 0.1&#160;M MnSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, exhibiting a reversible capacity of &#8764;240 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a C/10 rate with a Coulombic efficiency of &#8764;99%. The self-ion exchange mechanism and structural changes during the battery operation were investigated using ex-situ x-ray diffraction and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. The reversible phase transformations between hydrated and partially dehydrated states suggest a robust mechanism for Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion insertion and extraction, contributing to the stability and performance of the Zn&#8211;Mn electrode material in ZIB applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Backboned Polymers: A New Concept for Thermoelectric Materials</title>

MBPs, with a unique backbone entirely composed of bonded metal atoms, offer promising quantum confinement that enhances electrical conductivity while reducing thermal conductivity. This Concept highlights their potential for the advanced thermoelectric materials, with recent progress, challenges, and future directions discussed.







Abstract
Thermoelectric materials, capable of directly converting heat into electricity, offer significant potential for advancing renewable energy solutions. However, conventional thermoelectric materials, typically based on bulky structures, are constrained by the thermoelectric transport paradox. Metal&#8208;backboned polymers, emerging as one&#8208;dimensional materials designed at the single atom level, offer quantum confinement that enhances electrical conductivity while reducing thermal conductivity, potentially overcoming the above limitations. Herein, we explore the potential of metal&#8208;backboned polymers for the development of highly efficient thermoelectric materials, including their synthesis, structural advantages, potential applications and recent advancements. Moreover, current challenges and promising directions for further advancing their performance and applicability in eco&#8208;friendly energy technologies are also discussed.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution Molecular&#8208;Dynamics Simulations of the Pyruvate Kinase Muscle Isoform 1 and 2 (PKM1/2)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 20, April 4, 2025. </description>

Producing more than 6&#8197;&#956;s of cumulated simulation time with the AMOEBA polarizable force field, we determined key structural properties of the PKM2 (catalytic, FBP and TEPP) and PKM1 enzymes binding sites to determine new cryptic pockets for further antiviral/antitumoral drug design.







Abstract
Glucose metabolism plays a pivotal role in physiological processes and cancer growth. The final stage of glycolysis, converting phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) into pyruvate, is catalyzed by the pyruvate kinase (PK) enzyme. Whereas PKM1 is mainly expressed in cells with high energy requirements, PKM2 is preferentially expressed in proliferating cells, including tumor cells. Structural analysis of PKM1 and PKM2 is essential to design new molecules with antitumoral activity. To understand their structural dynamics, we performed extensive high&#8208;resolution molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using adaptive sampling techniques coupled to the polarizable AMOEBA force field. Performing more than 6&#8197;&#956;s of simulation, we considered all oligomerization states of PKM2 and propose structural insights for PKM1 to further study the PKM2&#8208;specific allostery. We focused on key sites including the active site and the natural substrate Fructose Bi&#8208;Phosphate (FBP) fixation pocket. Additionally, we present the first MD simulation of biologically active PKM1 and uncover important similarities with its PKM2 counterpart bound to FBP. We also analysed TEPP&#8208;46&#8217;s fixation, a pharmacological activator binding a different pocket, on PKM2 and highlighted the structural differences and similarities compared to PKM2 bound to FBP. Finally, we determined potential new cryptic pockets specific to PKM2 for drug targeting.

         <title>Structural Characteristics of a Partially Planarized Triarylmethyl Cation with Unsymmetrical Push&#8211;Pull Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 20, April 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We achieved for the first time the synthesis and isolation of the push&#8211;pull&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;cation salts with sufficient stability. The unique feature is not limited to the structure. We found that the &#960;&#8208;cation salt with planar anion exhibits panchromatic absorption in the solid state accompanying a near&#8208;infrared absorption with a &#955;onset value of 1030&#8197;nm.







Abstract
We report the physical properties of a new class of triarylmethyl&#8208;based carbocations containing both an electron&#8208;donating diphenyl ether moiety and an electron&#8208;accepting carbonyl group with a helical plane framework. Their unique packing patterns were clarified by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, which depend on the counter anions to influence their photophysical properties in the solid states. Notably, the interactions between &#960;&#8208;cation species and planar anion species lead to a unique panchromatic property, accompanying a near&#8208;infrared absorption with a &#955;onset value of 1030&#8197;nm, which can be assigned to intermolecular charge transfer transition. We found that the &#960;&#8208;cation species with planar anion formed cation dimers, being stacked in opposite directions. The two cation molecules are flanked by two anions on both the top and bottom side. Pair interaction energy decomposition analysis (PIEDA) calculations imply that the origins of the unique packing patterns of the &#960;&#8208;cations originate from the electrostatic forces of four neighbouring &#960;&#8208;anion species.

         <title>Computational Study of Alkyne&#8208;Acid Cycloisomerization in Gold&#8208;Functionalized Resorcinarene Cavitand</title>

         <dc:description>
The binding and cycloisomerization of acetylenic acids to give the corresponding &#947;&#8208;lactones in a gold&#8208;functionalized resorcinarene&#8208;based cavitand are studied by means of density functional theory calculations. The reaction mechanism and selectivity are investigated for substrates with different substituents to assess the size&#8208;reactivity relationships. The influence of the cavitand walls on the reactivity and selectivity is examined using a stripped&#8208;down model.







Abstract
Herein, we report density functional theory calculations to investigate the reaction mechanism and the selectivity of the cycloisomerization of alkynoic acids inside a gold&#8208;functionalized resorcinarene&#8208;based cavitand. This cavitand has experimentally been shown to catalyze the cycloisomerization of a number of substituted alkynoic acids to give the corresponding &#947;&#8208;lactones. Three representative substrates, with different substitution patterns, are considered in the calculations, and for each of them, the geometries and energies of various binding modes are first characterized. Next, the cycloisomerization reaction mechanism is evaluated, which is shown to consist of an intramolecular addition of the carboxylic acid to the gold&#8208;activated alkyne triple bond, followed by a protodeauration step. Both 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig and 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclizations were considered, leading to &#947;&#8208; or &#948;&#8208;lactones, respectively, and the involvement of the triflate counterion in the cyclization step is discussed. Finally, the influence of the cavitand walls on the reactivity is evaluated by using a model catalyst in which the walls were removed.

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of Saturated Bioisosteres of Ortho&#8208;Substituted Benzenes by Artificial Photoenzyme</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 20, April 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of saturated bioisosteres of ortho&#8208;disubstituted benzenes was reported by the artificial photoenzyme harboring a genetic incorporated photosensor under the light with several examples after the directed evolution. Our work provides a biocatalytic strategy for the synthesis of saturated bioisosteres of ortho&#8208;disubstituted benzenes and expands the utility of artificial photoenzyme for abiological reactions.







Abstract
Saturated bioisosteres of ortho&#8208;substituted benzenes are of significant interest due to their enhanced pharmacokinetic properties, such as improved metabolic stability and reduced toxicity, making them valuable in drug design and development. However, efficient synthesis of them remains a challenge in organic chemistry. Herein, we report the biocatalytic synthesis of saturated bioisosteres of ortho&#8208;substituted benzenes using engineered artificial photoenzymes. The artificial photoenzyme, incorporating genetically encoded unnatural amino acids with benzophenone photosensitizer residue, facilitate the formation of chiral saturated bioisosteres with moderate enantiomeric excess via the energy transfer process. Our results demonstrate the versatility of artificial photoenzymes in mediating new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reactions that are difficult to achieve with conventional chemical or enzymatic methods.

&lt;p&gt;The biosynthesis of saturated bioisosteres of ortho-disubstituted benzenes was reported by the artificial photoenzyme harboring a genetic incorporated photosensor under the light with several examples after the directed evolution. Our work provides a biocatalytic strategy for the synthesis of saturated bioisosteres of ortho-disubstituted benzenes and expands the utility of artificial photoenzyme for abiological reactions.

         <title>Isolation of a Rare Terminal Zr(IV) Peroxide and Insight into Polyoxovanadate Support Impact on Thioether Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 20, April 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lability of a terminal methoxide on a zirconium&#8208;doped polyoxovanadate&#8208;alkoxide (POV&#8208;alkoxide) is demonstrated through pKa driven reactions. Single crystals of the decorated ZrPOV&#8208;alkoxide are reported which include a rare monomeric Zr&#8208;peroxo species. The POV metalloligand serves as an electron&#8208;rich scaffold allowing the Zr to engage in electrophilic oxidation of thioethers via hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant.







Abstract
Substitutional lability of the terminal methoxide ligand on a Zr(IV) substituted polyoxovanadate&#8208;alkoxide (POV&#8208;alkoxide) via protonolysis is presented. Addition of excess water or stoichiometric 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol results in the exchange of the terminal methoxide ligand for a hydroxide or 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethoxide ligand, respectively. The lability of the terminal methoxide ligand at zirconium is leveraged to access a relatively stable terminal peroxide bound to a POV&#8208;alkoxide supported Zr(IV) center, via addition of hydrogen peroxide adducts compatible with organic solvent. Isolation of the terminal peroxide complex allows for investigation into the impact of the sterically protected, electron&#8208;rich POV&#8208;alkoxide support on the activation of hydrogen peroxide at Zr(IV). While the isolated peroxide complex is inactive towards the oxidation of thioethers, the methoxy terminated Zr(IV) functions as a precatalyst for the reaction. Mechanistic analysis reveals electrophilic oxidation conditions with hydrogen peroxide substrates, with a nucleophilic parameter (

&#967;Nu

 ${{{{\bf\chi}}}_{{\bf N u}}}$



) of 0.09&#177;0.02. In thioether oxidation reactions, selectivity for sulfoxide products (95&#8211;99&#8201;%) in acetonitrile is observed, suggesting the use of a reduced POV&#8208;alkoxide prevents over&#8208;oxidation of substrate.

         <title>Fragment&#8208;Based Approach for Hierarchical Nanotube Assembly of Small Molecules in Aqueous Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 20, April 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fragment&#8208;based approach is effective in drug design and protein assemblies but remains underexplored for biomaterial construction in aqueous environments. This study presents the first integration of self&#8208;assembling fragments to design a small organic molecule forming polymorphic nanotubes. Its compact structure enables hierarchical assembly, demonstrating a flexible strategy for supramolecular biomaterials in water&#8208;based systems.







Abstract
A fragment&#8208;based approach has proven successful in drug design and protein assemblies, yet its potential for constructing biomaterials from simple organic building blocks remains underexplored, particularly for self&#8208;assembly in aqueous phases, where water disrupts intermolecular hydrogen bonding. To the best of our knowledge, this study introduces the first case of integrating fragments from self&#8208;assembling molecules to design a small organic molecule that forms novel hierarchical nanotubes with polymorphism. The molecule's compact design incorporates three structural motifs derived from known nanotube assemblies, enabling a hierarchical assembly process: individual molecules with two conformations form dimers, which organize into hexameric units. These hexamers further assemble into nanotubes comprising 2&#8208;, 5&#8208;, and 6&#8208;protofilament fibers. The nanofibers share a nearly identical asymmetric unit &#8211; a hexameric triangular plate &#8211; with similar axial and lateral interfaces. The lateral interface, involving interactions between phosphate groups and aromatic rings, exhibits plasticity, allowing slight rotational variations between adjacent units. This adaptability facilitates the formation of diverse nanofiber architectures, showcasing the flexibility of these systems in aqueous environments. By leveraging fragments of self&#8208;assembling molecules, this work demonstrates a straightforward strategy that combines conformational flexibility and self&#8208;assembling fragments to construct advanced supramolecular biomaterials from small organic building blocks in aqueous settings.

         <title>Quinones as Multifunctional Scaffolds for Oxidative, Reductive, and HAT Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 20, April 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quinone scaffolds facilitate light&#8208;driven redox transformations across a redox window of approximately 5&#8197;V, supporting oxidative, reductive, and HAT reactions. Oxidative and HAT processes occur under ambient air, while reductive transformations require an inorganic base. Their adaptability to facilitate a broad range of radical and ionic processes under just two conditions highlights the potential of quinone scaffolds in photoredox catalysis.







Abstract
Photoredox catalysis, which enables both electron and hydrogen atom transfer, has become a powerful tool for activating chemical bonds and synthesizing complex molecules under mild conditions. Typically, photocatalysts are optimized either for oxidative or reductive reactions within a limited redox window (less than 3.1&#8197;V) and for hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions, with few frameworks capable of mediating both pathways for high redox&#8208;demanding reactions (covering more than a 5&#8197;V redox window) without requiring special conditions. Herein, we report the use of quinones as multifunctional scaffolds in light&#8208;driven redox transformations, offering access to a redox window of approximately 5&#8197;V using visible light. The quinone scaffold's versatility facilitates a wide range of radical and ionic processes under both oxidative and reductive conditions, in addition to enabling HAT reactions. By keeping the parameters, i.&#8201;e. the reaction partners, constant, such transformations can be carried out under just two reaction conditions. Oxidative transformations and HAT reactions occur under ambient air, while activation of the chromophore for reductive transformations can be achieved using an inorganic base (Cs2CO3) via a simple acid&#8208;base deprotonation event. This dual capability highlights the potential of quinones as scaffolds to extend their utility in photoredox catalysis.

         <title>Homochiral Carboxylate&#8208;Anchored Truxene Tripods: Design, Synthesis, and Monolayer Formation on Ag(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 20, April 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stimulated by the renewed interest in chirality&#8208;based optical and electronic properties of molecules, a chiral truxene&#8208;based molecular tripod, namely truxene trisacetic acid (TTA), was newly synthesized and chirally resolved. A systematic study using synchrotron&#8208;based spectroscopic techniques and scanning tunneling microscopy revealed that homochiral TTA forms a densely packed and ordered monolayer on the Ag(111) surface.







Abstract
The design of well&#8208;defined assemblies of chiral molecules is a prerequisite for numerous applications, such as chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS). In this context, tripodal molecular films bear the advantage of better control of molecular orientation and alignment than analogous monopodal systems. To this end, we report on the synthesis and assembly property of C3 chiral syn&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;truxene triacetic acid. (S,S,S) and (R,R,R) enantiomers were isolated and adsorbed on underpotential deposited Ag(111)/Au/mica both individually and as a racemate. The enantiomers form a densely packed and well&#8208;ordered structure (including the azimuthal alignment), even though with small sizes of individual domains. The molecules adsorb predominantly in tripodal configuration, with all three docking groups bound to the substrate as carboxylates in a bidentate fashion. The truxene backbone is then oriented parallel to the substrate surface but the fluorene blades are twisted to some extent. The racemate monolayer turned out to be less densely packed and less well&#8208;ordered compared to the films of individual enantiomers, which underlines the fact that uniform chirality is primarily important for molecular ordering of the truxenes. We hope that the designed system will be useful in the context of CISS and stimulate further activities regarding chiral tripods.

         <title>Ba2BP7N14 &#8211; A Quaternary Alkaline Earth Nitridoborophosphate with a Mixed 3D Network Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 20, April 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The alkaline earth nitridoborophosphate Ba2BP7N14 was synthesized under high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature conditions. The crystal structure reveals a 3D&#8208;network of PN4 and mixed occupied (P0.75B0.25)N4 tetrahedra and was determined using a multi&#8208;step characterization process including SCXRD, PXRD, elemental analysis, electron microscopy and NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore, materials properties were investigated. This approach provides first insights into mixed quaternary AE&#8211;B&#8211;P&#8211;N systems.







Abstract
Highly condensed alkaline earth nitridophosphates have attracted increasing scientific interest, due to their high thermal and chemical stability, as well as their promising luminescence behavior upon doping with Eu2+ for pc&#8208;LED applications. In particular, the barely explored mixed tetrahedra&#8208;based nitridophosphates offer a wide range of structural and compositional diversity, enabling new insights into structure&#8208;property relationships. Herein, we report on the first quaternary alkaline earth nitridoborophosphate Ba2BP7N14, synthesized at 8&#8197;GPa and 1600&#8201;&#176;C in a multianvil press, starting from Ba(N3)2, h&#8208;BN and P3N5. Ba2BP7N14 crystallizes in the barylite&#8208;1O polytype and features a highly condensed mixed (B,P)&#8211;N anionic 3D network (&#954;&#8776;0.57) built up of PN4 and mixed occupied (P0.75B0.25)N4 tetrahedra. The structure was characterized by a multi&#8208;step process involving single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD, PXRD), elemental analysis, electron microscopy (STEM, EELS), and solid&#8208;state 31P and 11B MAS NMR spectroscopy. The plausibility of the structural model was corroborated by low&#8208;cost crystallographic calculations. The optical band gap and the thermal behavior of an undoped sample of Ba2BP7N14, were determined from diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and temperature&#8208;dependent powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, respectively. Irradiation of a Eu2+&#8208;doped sample with near&#8208;UV light results in a blue emission peaking at &#955;em=422&#8197;nm.

         <title>The Lewis Acidity of Bare and Crown Ether&#8208;Complexed Germanium(II) and Tin(II) Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 20, April 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis acidity of a variety of dicationic germanium(II) and tin(II) crown ether complexes was assessed by the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett and Fluoride Ion Affinity methods. The germanium(II) centre was found, in general, to be more Lewis acidic than the tin(II) centre. The most promising complexes for catalysis are [Ge([18]crown&#8208;6)][OTf]2 and [Ge([12]crown&#8208;4)2][OTf]2.







Abstract
The Gutmann&#8208;Beckett and Fluoride Ion Affinity methods were used to assess the Lewis acidity of a variety of dicationic germanium(II) and tin(II) crown ether complexes and the corresponding neutral halides. The coordination of two or more equivalents of triethylphosphine oxide (TEPO) was observed which was accompanied by full or partial replacement of the crown ether or chloride ligands from the metal centre illustrating the importance of unambiguously identifying the species in solution to enable a meaningful discussion of relative Lewis acidities. From the coordination complexes observed, the germanium(II) centre was found, in general, to be more Lewis acidic than the tin(II) centre. The crown ether ligands, when retained, had little influence on the Lewis acidity of the complex and may, for ease of synthesis, be used as convenient precursors to &#8220;bare&#8221; Ge(II) and Sn(II) dicationic catalysts.

Herein, we developed O&#8208;glycosyl (D&#8208;Glcp, D&#8208;Galp, D&#8208;GlcNAcp, D&#8208;GalNAcp, L&#8208;Fucp, D&#8208;Xylp, L&#8208;Araf, for instance) trichloroacetimidates as glycosyl donors, which can be actived by TfOH with DMF or TBAI as additives, affording the 1,2&#8208;cis linked glycosyl amino acids serve as valuable building blocks for glycopeptide synthesis via solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). The glycosylation protocol was characterized by its excellent &#945; selectivity and simple operation and broad applicability to various substrates.







Abstract
A highly stereoselective strategy to facilitate the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;O&#8208;linked glycosyl amino acids was established via a additive&#8208;modulated trichloroacetimidate glycosylation approach. This mild and practical protocol demonstrates broad applicability with diverse glycosyl donors, including D&#8208;gluco&#8208;, D&#8208;galacto&#8208;, 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8208;azido&#8208;D&#8208;gluco&#8208;, 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8208;azido&#8208;D&#8208;galacto&#8208;, D&#8208;xylo&#8208;, L&#8208;fuco&#8208;pyranosyl and L&#8208;arabinofuranosyl trichloroacetimidates, and orthogonally protected amino acids such as Ser, Thr, Tyr, and 4&#8208;hydroxyproline (Hyp) as acceptors.

         <title>Identification of Two Distinct Stereoselective Lysine 5&#8208;Hydroxylases by Genome Mining Based on Alazopeptin Biosynthetic Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 20, April 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymes that catalyze regio&#8208; and stereoselective hydroxylation of amino acids are valuable for pharmaceutical production. Two lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases (Am_AzpK2 and Pp_AzpK2) that synthesize (2S,5S)&#8208; and (2S,5R)&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxylysine, respectively, were identified by genome mining. Several lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases in the genome database were also characterized. Stereoselective dehydrogenases for (2S,5S)&#8208; and (2S,5R)&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxylysine were also discovered.







Abstract
Enzymes that catalyze regioselective and stereoselective hydroxylation of amino acids are useful tools for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals. AzpK is an unprecedented lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylase that is involved in alazopeptin biosynthesis, although its enzymatic activity has not been confirmed in&#8197;vitro. Here, we identified two &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate/Fe2+&#8208;dependent dioxygenases in Actinosynnema mirum and Pseudomonas psychrotolerans (Am_AzpK2 and Pp_AzpK2, respectively) as lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases, using genome mining based on the alazopeptin biosynthetic gene cluster. Interestingly, Am_AzpK2 and Pp_AzpK2 synthesized different isomers, (2S,5S)&#8208; and (2S,5R)&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxylysine, respectively. We also identified two AzpJ homologs as the dehydrogenases that specifically recognize the hydroxy groups of (2S,5S)&#8208; and (2S,5R)&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxylysine to synthesize a keto group. These dehydrogenases were shown to be useful tools for characterizing the stereochemistry of 5&#8208;hydroxylysine and evaluating the activity of lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases. Furthermore, we identified three lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases that synthesize (2S,5S)&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxylysine and four lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases that synthesize (2S,5R)&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxylysine from the genome database. Genome scanning based on lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases indicated the presence of undiscovered natural products with 5&#8208;hydroxylysine moieties. In conclusion, this study provides a fundamental technology for the stereoselective production of 5&#8208;hydroxylysine. Further analysis of the stereoselective lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases would reveal how nature establishes highly stereoselective hydroxylation.

&lt;p&gt;Enzymes that catalyze regio- and stereoselective hydroxylation of amino acids are valuable for pharmaceutical production. Two lysine 5-hydroxylases (Am_AzpK2 and Pp_AzpK2) that synthesize (2S,5S)- and (2S,5R)-5-hydroxylysine, respectively, were identified by genome mining. Several lysine 5-hydroxylases in the genome database were also characterized. Stereoselective dehydrogenases for (2S,5S)- and (2S,5R)-5-hydroxylysine were also discovered.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enzymes that catalyze regioselective and stereoselective hydroxylation of amino acids are useful tools for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals. AzpK is an unprecedented lysine 5-hydroxylase that is involved in alazopeptin biosynthesis, although its enzymatic activity has not been confirmed &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we identified two &#945;-ketoglutarate/Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent dioxygenases in &lt;i&gt;Actinosynnema mirum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas psychrotolerans&lt;/i&gt; (Am_AzpK2 and Pp_AzpK2, respectively) as lysine 5-hydroxylases, using genome mining based on the alazopeptin biosynthetic gene cluster. Interestingly, Am_AzpK2 and Pp_AzpK2 synthesized different isomers, (2&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,5&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)- and (2&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,5&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-5-hydroxylysine, respectively. We also identified two AzpJ homologs as the dehydrogenases that specifically recognize the hydroxy groups of (2&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,5&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)- and (2&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,5&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-5-hydroxylysine to synthesize a keto group. These dehydrogenases were shown to be useful tools for characterizing the stereochemistry of 5-hydroxylysine and evaluating the activity of lysine 5-hydroxylases. Furthermore, we identified three lysine 5-hydroxylases that synthesize (2&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,5&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-5-hydroxylysine and four lysine 5-hydroxylases that synthesize (2&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,5&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-5-hydroxylysine from the genome database. Genome scanning based on lysine 5-hydroxylases indicated the presence of undiscovered natural products with 5-hydroxylysine moieties. In conclusion, this study provides a fundamental technology for the stereoselective production of 5-hydroxylysine. Further analysis of the stereoselective lysine 5-hydroxylases would reveal how nature establishes highly stereoselective hydroxylation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A &#960;&#8208;conjugated porous organic polymer containing imine and triazine functional moieties was explored as a metal&#8208;free bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water&#8208;splitting in the alkaline medium.







Abstract
A conjugated porous organic polymer (SMCOP&#8208;4) with imine linkage and triazine functional moiety was rationally designed and synthesized by an imine condensation reaction. The &#960;&#8208;conjugated network of SMCOP&#8208;4 facilitates electron mobility, enhancing electrochemical activity. Metal&#8208;free electrocatalyst SMCOP&#8208;4 shows superior performance for HER and OER with a low overpotential of 139&#8197;mV and 295&#8197;mV, respectively, at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density and with small Tafel slopes in alkaline electrolytes. Along with the low overpotential values, the electrocatalyst is highly stable at electrochemical conditions. Further, density functional theory calculations were carried out to identify the most active sites in catalyzing the HER and OER on the SMCOP&#8208;4 catalyst.

         <title>Controlled Pyrolysis of Bromine&#8208;Modulated Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Solvent&#8208;Free and Co&#8208;Catalyst&#8208;Free Cycloaddition of CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 20, April 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a controlled pyrolysis strategy to develop a metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;derived catalyst that innovatively incorporates unsaturated Zn and C&#8722;Br bond as acid and base sites, respectively. The catalyst exhibits superior activity and selectivity with &gt;99&#8201;% propylene carbonates yield for the co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free and solvent&#8208;free CO2 cycloaddition with propylene oxide under mild conditions.







Abstract
The cycloaddition of CO&#8322; with epoxides to synthesize cyclic carbonates is a crucial but challenging process. In particular, the co&#8208;catalyst required for higher yields in this reaction inevitably dissolves in organic solvents, resulting in product impurities and solvent&#8208;related hazards. Therefore, a heterogeneous catalyst that delivers high yields under solvent&#8208;free and co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free conditions is highly desirable. In this study, we propose a controlled pyrolysis strategy to develop a metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;derived catalyst that innovatively incorporates bromine via a C&#8722;Br bond. EXAFS, FT&#8208;IR and XPS analyses reveal the co&#8208;presence of unsaturated Zn sites and C&#8722;Br bonds, which act as acid and base sites, respectively. The synergy between these sites prevents bromine leakage and facilitates the ring&#8208;opening of epoxides, thereby overcoming the barriers in the cycloaddition reaction. As a result, this catalyst achieves superior catalytic performance with over 99&#8201;% yield of propylene carbonates under solvent&#8208;free and co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free conditions. The resulting propylene carbonate can be used directly as an electrolyte in battery applications without further purification. This work provides valuable insights into the modular design of heterogeneous catalysts for solvent&#8208;free and co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free CO&#8322; cycloaddition reactions.

         <title>Rational Construction of a Pyrimido[2,1&#8208;b] Benzothiazole&#8208;Based Photoswitchable Smart AIE Material: A Theoretical Insight into Fluorescence Switching Mechanism of the Chimeric Dyad</title>

This research explored a chimeric design strategy to integrate bisthienylethene into a pyrimido[2,1&#8208;b][1,3] benzothiazole AIEgen (PBTE) as the head group. The ultrafast intramolecular FRET which outcompetes the nonradiative decay was identified as the dominant channel for fluorescence quenching of PBTE&#8211;c. The excellent AIE photoswitching capability enabled its applications in erasable optical memory and multi&#8208;dimensional anti&#8208;counterfeiting.







Abstract
Currently, AIEgen&#8208;photochromics conjugates and intrinsic photochromic AIEgens are the two major molecular design strategies for photoresponsive AIE materials. However, these two strategies still have their own limitations. In our previous research, we discovered pyrimido[2,1&#8208;b][1,3]benzothiazole (PBT) as a novel core structure of AIEgens. We herein explored a chimeric strategy to rationally integrate photochromic bisthienylethene (BTE) as the orthogonal head group into a new PBT molecule (PBTE). Compared to the conventional design strategies, the compact chimeric design of PBTE not only well maintains the AIE and photochromic properties of the parent fragments but also leads to excellent AIE&#8208;photoswitching capability in both films and single crystals. Theoretical calculations revealed that MO energy level arrangement of PBTE reorganized upon photoisomerization and the fast vibrational relaxation (VR) along with internal conversion (IC) from S5 to S1 state may serve as a competitive channel for the fluorescence quenching of PBTE&#8211;c. Comparison of the kinetics of the nonradiative decay with those of the excited&#8208;state energy transfer (EET) processes clearly showed that the ultrafast intramolecular F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is the dominant cause of fluorescence&#8208;off state. The applications of PBTE in erasable optical memory material and multi&#8208;dimensional anti&#8208;counterfeiting have also been demonstrated.

         <title>Convenient Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;Acyl Glycosides and its Application in the Synthesis of Scleropentaside A, Scleropentaside B and the Derivatives of Dapagliflozin</title>

An efficient synthetic strategy for constructing &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;acyl glycosides is developed through nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive coupling and isomerization, which is subsequently applied in the total synthesis of the natural products scleropentaside A and scleropentaside B. Additionally, &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;acyl glucosides and their derivatives demonstrate significant SGLT2 inhibitory activity, making them potential candidates for diabetes treatment.







Abstract
C&#8208;Glycosides are a common feature in numerous bioactive natural compounds and play a crucial role as mimics of O/N&#8208;glycosides. Our process for synthesizing &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;acyl glycosides involves a reductive cross&#8208;coupling of protected glycosyl bromides with the corresponding carboxylic acid, followed by base&#8208;assisted deprotection and isomerization. This method is compatible with diverse glycosyl donors, including disaccharides. Consequently, we achieved the total synthesis of the natural products scleropentaside A and scleropentaside B with exceptional efficiency. These &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;acyl glycosides can be readily transformed into novel forms of C&#8208;glycosides capable of disrupting signaling pathways linked to various pathological conditions, such as diabetes.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-Glycosides are a common feature in numerous bioactive natural compounds and play a crucial role as mimics of &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-glycosides. Our process for synthesizing &#946;-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-acyl glycosides involves a reductive cross-coupling of protected glycosyl bromides with the corresponding carboxylic acid, followed by base-assisted deprotection and isomerization. This method is compatible with diverse glycosyl donors, including disaccharides. Consequently, we achieved the total synthesis of the natural products scleropentaside A and scleropentaside B with exceptional efficiency. These &#946;-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-acyl glycosides can be readily transformed into novel forms of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-glycosides capable of disrupting signaling pathways linked to various pathological conditions, such as diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 20, April 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double photochemical cryo thiol&#8208;ene coupling process was developed as a general method for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8217;&#8208;thio&#8208;linked di&#8208; and oligosaccharides. The procedure includes i) UV&#8208;initiated coupling reaction of 2&#8208;substituted glycals with HSAc in AcOH at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C in frozen state, ii) selective S&#8208;deacetylation of the resulting glycosyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;SAc derivatives, iii) cryo thiol&#8208;ene reaction of the obtaining &#945;&#8208;1&#8208;thiosugars with 2&#8208;substituted&#8208;glycals.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Glycosyl thiols are key building blocks for the formation of stable thioglycoside mimetics of widespread and biologically relevant &#945;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosides, which urges their efficient synthesis. Here, we demonstrate that the photoinitiated radical&#8208;mediated addition of thioacetic acid to 2&#8208;substituted glycals followed by selective S&#8208;deacetylation is a generally applicable and fully stereoselective method for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;glycosyl thiols. The low reactivity of thioacetic acid in the radical reaction was overcome by carrying out the reaction in AcOH at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C, in frozen state, with UVA irradiation, achieving high yields irrespective of the sugar configurations. For effective irradiation and simultaneous effective cooling, a self&#8208;made spiral vessel reactor was used, which also enables large&#8208;scale synthesis. By subjecting 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;1&#8208;thiosugars to a second thiol&#8208;ene coupling reaction with 2&#8208;substituted glycals, 34 trehalose&#8208;type symmetrical and unsymmetrical &#945;,&#945;&#8217;&#8208;thiodi&#8208; and oligosaccharides were obtained with full stereoselectivity. Moreover, the oxidation of &#945;&#8208;1&#8208;thiosugars provided an easy access to &#945;,&#945;&#8217;&#8208;diglycosyl disulfides.

         <title>Flavanone&#8208;enabled CuAAC Reaction: Noninnocent Reagents Driving a Mononuclear Mechanism Over the Dinuclear Paradigm</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 20, April 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The copper&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition reaction involving a naringenin derivative as both substrate and ligand leads to an efficient process via a mononuclear (Cu&#8208;catalyzed) mechanism, as elucidated by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry and reliable DFT calculations of the complete free energy profile.







Abstract
In this work, we report the use of the CuAAC (copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition) reaction to obtain different triazole derivatives bridged to the naringenin skeleton, leading to the combination of a triazole pharmacophoric group with a bioactive flavanone. The generation of Cu(I) active species was done using CuSO4 salts and sodium ascorbate, resulting in moderate to high yields when the DMSO&#8208;water binary system was used as solvents. Mechanistic studies were done using density functional theory calculations and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). We investigated the reduction process of Cu(II) to Cu(I), and the role of mononuclear and dinuclear copper species in the catalysis of the cycloaddition reaction. Our combined theoretical and experimental results indicate that the mechanism involving a single copper species is taking place, with the cycloaddition step being the rate&#8208;determining step. The calculations indicate that the mechanism involving two copper species has the deprotonation of the coordinated terminal alkyne as the rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioconvergent Alkylation Reactions That Construct Chiral Quaternary Carbon Centers and Tune C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp2) Bond Rotation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 20, April 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organocatalytic enantioconvergent alkylation reactions of racemic diastereomers that construct all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters, which ease the rotation of the bond between the central chiral carbon and the dihydrobenzofuranone moiety, have been developed. The products have the benefits of the central chiral center and the flexibly rotatable bond to locate a part of the moieties at various positions for interacting with other molecules.







Abstract
In molecules with central chiral centers functionalized with aryl groups, the rotation of the single bond between the aryl group and the central chiral center may be hindered. Enantioconvergent alkylation reactions of racemic diastereomers to construct all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters resulting in easing of the rotation around the axes are described. We demonstrated that the rotation of the bond between a central chiral carbon center and a dihydrobenzofuranone can be tuned by selection of either a tertiary carbon bearing a hydrogen or a quaternary carbon at the central chiral center. The products have the benefits of a central chiral center and a flexibly rotatable bond, which can facilitate interactions with other molecules.

         <title>Photoinduced Radical Luminescence of Diazapyrene Derivatives upon Complexation with Cucurbit[n]uril Hosts</title>

The CB[n]&#8208;based host&#8208;guest complexation regulates the luminescence of D&#8722;A type diazapyrene radical cations by enhancing their stabilities, prolonging their fluorescence lifetimes, and increasing their quantum yields.







Abstract
Molecular design with an electron donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) structure and host&#8208;guest complexation are effective strategies for stabilizing radicals. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of cationic diazapyrene derivatives featuring a D&#8722;A structure, as well as the influence of host&#8208;guest complexation on their photoinduced organic radical photophysical properties. Compared to the methylated diazapyrene 1, the other three derivatives 2&#8211;4, containing triphenylamine, coumarin, and naphthalene units as D groups, respectively, are more favorable for the generation of radicals. Binding studies reveal that cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) forms 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complexes with derivatives 2&#8211;4, while CB[10] forms a 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 inclusion complex with 2 and supramolecular polymers with 3 and 4. The radical luminescence of derivatives 1&#8211;4 in aqueous solution is significantly promoted upon complexation with CB[8] or CB[10]. Additionally, the emission color of 3 shifts from cyan to yellow&#8208;green upon light irradiation in the presence of CB[8].

Crystal phase engineering of TiO2 via thermal annealing of Ti metal&#8208;organic frameworks can afford high photocatalytic non&#8208;oxidative coupling of methane performance.







Abstract
Photocatalytic non&#8208;oxidative coupling of methane (NOCM) is an appealing approach to produce ethane and hydrogen, however, most developed photocatalysts still suffer from low activity. Here, we demonstrate that the crystal phase engineering of TiO2 via thermal annealing of Ti metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) can afford high photocatalytic NOCM performance in a flow reactor under UV&#8208;visible light irradiation. The characterization results show that engineering the TiO2 crystal phase can improve the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers and promote the formation of &#8901;CH3 intermediate, thus achieving the improved performance of photocatalytic NOCM reaction. This research provides a new perspective towards the design and construction of efficient photocatalysts for NOCM reaction.

The polyoxovanadate&#8208;based metal&#8722;organic framework with dual&#8208;active centers catalyzes the oxidation of substituted phenols to synthesize functionalized p&#8208;benzoquinones efficiently and maintains excellent catalytic performance.







Abstract
A novel polyoxovanadate&#8208;based metal&#8722;organic framework (POV&#8208;MOF), [Cu(bix)]{V2O6} (V&#8211;Cu&#8208;MOF, bix=1,4&#8208;bis(imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethyl)benzene), has been successfully synthesized and characterized. The V&#8211;Cu&#8208;MOF demonstrates exceptional performance in the selective oxidation of 2,3,6&#8208;trimethylphenol to 2,3,5&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone within just 10 minutes under mild conditions using hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant. The V&#8211;Cu&#8208;MOF exhibits remarkable versatility, efficiently oxidizing various substituted phenols while maintaining high catalytic activity. Additionally, it shows excellent recyclability, with conversion and selectivity consistently exceeding 97&#8201;% after multiple cycles. Mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction benefits from dual&#8208;active centers {V2O6}2&#8722; clusters and binuclear copper units. The weak substrate adsorption by binuclear copper prevents catalyst poisoning, ensuring sustained activity throughout the process.

         <title>Fine Tuning of Hybridized Local and Charge&#8208;Transfer Excited States and Luminescence in Carbazole/Benzothiadiazole Isomeric Emitters by Varying Linking Mode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 20, April 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By varying the linkage of carbazole donor from 3&#8208; to 2&#8208;site onto the benzothiadiazole acceptor in two isomeric HLCT emitters, the D&#8722;A dihedral angle is reduced, which not only reduces the HOMO delocalization and the charge transfer effect and causes fluorescence blue shift by 30&#8197;nm, but also increases molecular rigidity and improves PLQY to about 90&#8201;%. Green doped OLED of 2&#8208;site isomer exhibits high EQE of 5.79&#8201;%, being one of the best efficiencies for green HLCT materials based on benzothiadiazole acceptor.







Abstract
Hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) type emitters can harvest triplet excitons for light emission via high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing (hRISC), showing great potential for application in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Herein, two isomeric emitters NPC3BTD and NPC2BTD were developed by linking two 9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole (NPC) donors onto the central benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BTD) acceptor. By tuning the linkage from 3&#8208;site to 2&#8208;site of carbazole ring, the D&#8722;A dihedral angle was decreased, then the HOMO delocalization and CT/LE content ratio in HLCT excited states were reduced, thus NPC2BTD revealed fluorescence hypsochromic shift by 30&#8197;nm to green region. Simultaneously, the molecular rigidity was increased and non&#8208;radiative transition was suppressed, thus the photoluminescence quantum yield was increased to about 90&#8201;%. Their HLCT excited state nature was verified by the natural transition orbitals results and detection of two different excited dipole moments in various solvents. It is supposed the hRISC occur from T2 to S1 states. Yellow and green doped OLEDs of NPC3BTD and NPC2BTD exhibited external quantum efficiencies of 5.31&#8201;% and 5.79&#8201;% with exciton utilization efficiency of 36.12&#8201;% and 32.42&#8201;%. The superior performance of NPC2BTD over NPC3BTD was attributed to the finely tuned HLCT excited states through structure isomerization.

         <dc:description>
We reported an efficient asymmetric catalytic aza&#8208;Michael&#8208;initiated ring closure of methyleneindolinones with N&#8208;tosyloxycarbamates for the construction of spiro&#8208;aziridine oxindoles. A readily available chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/Ni(OTf)2 complex catalyst was identified to afford the corresponding products in good yields with high ee values. The stereospecific ring&#8208;opening of spiro&#8208;aziridine oxindoles enable the formation of glycinate&#8208;substituted oxindole derivatives.







Abstract
Asymmetric catalytic aza&#8208;Michael&#8208;initiated ring closure of methyleneindolinones with N&#8208;tosyloxycarbamates has been established. The reaction using a chiral nickel complex catalyst enabled the formation of a series of spiro&#8208;aziridine oxindoles in good yields (up to 99&#8201;%) with high stereoselectivity (up to 97&#8201;% ee, &gt;19&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr) under mild reaction conditions. Ring&#8208;opening of spiro&#8208;aziridine oxindole leads to formation of glycinate&#8208;bearing oxindoles with retention of configuration.

         <title>Reaction of a Potassium Aluminyl with Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2 &#8208; Isolation of a Stable, Trimetallic Sn(I) Radical Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 20, April 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of a potassium aluminyl with Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2 in benzene produces a [Sn4]4&#8211; cluster with edges composed of overlapping Sn 5p orbitals or three centre two electron Sn&#8211;Al&#8211;Sn bonds. Al(II) species produced during the reaction are trapped as a Birch reduction product. In methylcyclohexane (MCH) a trimetallic Sn(I) radical anion forms, with EPR spectroscopy showing the unpaired electron is located in an unhybridised 5p orbital on tin.







Abstract
The reaction of the potassium aluminyl K[Al(NON)] ([NON]2&#8211;=[O(SiMe2NDipp)2]2&#8211;, Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) with the stannylene Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2 in benzene afforded K3[(Sn4){Al(NON)}2{N(SiMe3)2}], containing a distorted tetrahedral Sn4&#8208;cluster.

&lt;p&gt;Reaction of a potassium aluminyl with Sn[N(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in benzene produces a [Sn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; cluster with edges composed of overlapping Sn 5&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; orbitals or three centre two electron Sn&#8211;Al&#8211;Sn bonds. Al(II) species produced during the reaction are trapped as a Birch reduction product. In methylcyclohexane (MCH) a trimetallic Sn(I) radical anion forms, with EPR spectroscopy showing the unpaired electron is located in an unhybridised 5&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; orbital on tin.

We report how with simple spectroscopic technic we could obtain clear evidence of narcissistic H&#8208;bonds self&#8208;sorting during supramolecular polymerization of a judiciously designed monomer endowing urea and amide functions.







Abstract
In this study, we unambiguously evidence, by mean of UV&#8208;Vis and NMR technics supported by theoretical calculations, that a narcissistic H&#8208;bond self&#8208;sorting takes place during supramolecular polymerization of a newly designed monomer equipped with mixed urea/amide H&#8208;bond donor/acceptor moieties.

         <title>Nitrile&#8208;tolerant Iridium&#8208;catalysed Hydrogen Isotope Exchange</title>

         <dc:description>
Herein, we describe the first effective nitrile&#8208;tolerant homogeneous catalysis methodology for hydrogen isotope exchange via ortho&#8208;directed C(sp2)&#8722;H activation using air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable iridium pre&#8208;catalysts of the type Ir(COD)(NHC)Cl under an atmosphere of deuterium gas. This methodology delivers high levels of isotopic labelling under mild and practicable reaction conditions via a range of heterocyclic, ketone, and amine directing units.







Abstract
Isotopically labelled molecules are vital tools within drug discovery and are used extensively to assess a given candidate's absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) profile. Related to this, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) has become a prominent technique for the rapid and selective late&#8208;stage installation of a deuterium or tritium label. Despite having a generally wide applicability, the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in this specific field is limited when particularly co&#8208;ordinating motifs are present within a given molecule to be labelled. For example, the exceptional binding strength and sterically unencumbered nature of the nitrile functionality leads to inhibition of catalyst turnover, and has hindered the development of efficient methods for the HIE of nitrile&#8208;containing molecules. Herein, in silico solvent binding energy parameter approaches have been disclosed which have facilitated the discovery of uniquely tolerant neutral iridium catalyst species that demonstrate a significantly lower binding strength with nitrile functionality. In turn, we describe the first effective nitrile&#8208;tolerant HIE methodology enabled via ortho&#8208;directed C(sp2)&#8722;H activation using air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable iridium pre&#8208;catalysts of the type Ir(COD)(NHC)Cl under an atmosphere of deuterium gas. This methodology proceeds under mild and practically accessible reaction conditions with a range of directing groups, including heterocycles, ketones, and amines, with this class of catalyst also shown to be applicable towards bioactive molecules, resulting in products with high levels of isotopic labelling.

         <title>Ball&#8208;Milling Assisted Synthesis of Monofluoroalkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 20, April 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons reaction enabled the formation of monofluoroalkenes with yields up to 99&#8201;%. The solid&#8208;state reaction condition allowed the formation of a broad scope of trisubstituted and tetrasubstituted fluorinated alkenes (48 examples) with the use of a weak base and a short reaction time from aldehydes of ketones. Moreover, the reaction conditions proved to be broadly applicable to various fluorophosphonoacetates, providing access to valuable fluorinated compounds.







Abstract
A solvent&#8208;free synthesis of valuable monofluoroalkenes was developed under ball&#8208;milling agitation. The use of 1.0&#8197;equivalent of carbonyl substrates and 1.1&#8197;equivalent of fluorophosphonoacetate derivatives with a weak inorganic base enabled the formation of the desired products after 30&#8197;min of reaction under sustainable conditions with minimized synthetic waste. No sequential addition of base, fluorophosphonate, and carbonyl substrates was needed, and the desired products were obtained with high purity only after a simple filtration. The protocol showed general efficiency and tolerance to a large panel of carbonyl substrates including aldehydes and ketones, as well as fluorophosphonoacetate derivatives with moderate stereoselectivities and yields ranging from 21&#8201;% to 99&#8201;% (48 examples).

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Based Copolymers for Templated Synthesis and Stabilization of Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 20, April 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Au(I)&#8208;NHC complex appended with a norbornene moiety is polymerized with another norbornene comonomer containing functionality of interest through ring&#8208;opening metathesis copolymerization to generate linear metallopolymers with highly controlled structure. These copolymers are reduced to generate multidentate polyNHC&#8208;coated Au&#8208;NPs with diverse properties and corona functionalities as well as excellent stability in aqueous media.







Abstract
Surface functionalization and colloidal stability are pivotal for numerous applications of gold nanoparticles (Au&#8208;NPs). Over the past decade, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have emerged as promising ligands for stabilizing Au&#8208;NPs owing to their ease of synthesis, structural diversity, and strong metal&#8208;ligand bonds. Here, we introduce new Au(I)&#8211;NHCcopolymer scaffolds as precursors to multidentate NHC&#8208;protected Au&#8208;NPs. Ring&#8208;opening metathesis copolymerization of a norbornene&#8208;appended Au(I)&#8722;NHC complex with another functionalized norbornene comonomer provides NHC&#8211;Au(I) copolymers with modular compositions and structures. Upon reduction, these copolymers yield multidentate polyNHC&#8208;coated Au&#8208;NPs with varied properties and corona functionalities dictated by the secondary monomer. These nanoparticles exhibit excellent size homogeneity and stability against aggregation in various buffers, cell culture media, and under exposure to electrolytes, oxidants, and exogenous thiols over extended periods. Moreover, we demonstrate post&#8208;synthetic surface functionalization reactions of polyNHC&#8722;Au&#8208;NPs while maintaining colloidal stability, highlighting their robustness and potential for applications such as bioconjugation. Overall, these findings underscore the potential of ROMP&#8208;derived NHC&#8208;containing copolymers as highly tunable and versatile multidentate ligands that may be suitable for other inorganic colloids and flat surfaces.

These nanoparticles exhibit excellent size homogeneity and stability against aggregation in various buffers, cell culture media, and under exposure to electrolytes, oxidants, and exogenous thiols over extended periods. Moreover, we demonstrate post-synthetic surface functionalization reactions of polyNHC&#8722;Au-NPs while maintaining colloidal stability, highlighting their robustness and potential for applications such as bioconjugation. Overall, these findings underscore the potential of ROMP-derived NHC-containing copolymers as highly tunable and versatile multidentate ligands that may be suitable for other inorganic colloids and flat surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Novel Space&#8208;Crowded Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Molecules for the Fabrication of Efficient Blue OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 20, April 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two tailored blue luminscent molecules with through&#8208;space charge transfer feature are synthesized and characterized. They exhibit strong deep blue photoluminescence, and can not only function efficiently as emitters in blue OLEDs but also serves as host materials for blue multi&#8208;resonance emitters, providing narrow blue electroluminescence spectra and excellent device efficiencies.







Abstract
Currently, the advance of high&#8208;resolution display device puts a high requirement for the development of efficient luminescent materials emitting high&#8208;quality blue light. But stable blue luminescent materials with high electroluminescence (EL) efficiencies and narrow emission spectra are still rare. In this work, two efficient blue molecules (mCPTC and 2mCPTC) are developed by linking large&#8208;volume electron donors of 1,3&#8208;bis(N&#8208;carbazolyl)benzene (mCP) and electron acceptor of 2,4&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (DPTRZ) on the 3,6&#8208;di(tert&#8208;butyl)carbazole holder through benzene bridges. Their thermal stability, crystal and electronic structures, energy levels, photophysical property, charge transport ability and EL behaviors are thoroughly studied. They hold high structural rigidity and through&#8208;space charge transfer characteristics between donor and acceptor, and exhibit strong deep blue photoluminescence. They can not only function as emitters in OLEDs to radiate deep blue light, but also serve as efficient hosts for blue multi&#8208;resonance emitter v&#8208;DABNA, providing narrow EL spectra and excellent EL efficiencies of 24.21&#8201;%, much higher than those in common host without sensitizers. These results demonstrate the good potentials of these blue molecules in the fabrication of efficient narrow&#8208;spectrum blue OLEDs.

         <title>External Phosphate Binding Triggered Formation of Coordination Bridged Dimer of Macrocyclic Trinuclear Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 20, April 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A macrocyclic trinuclear Zn complex that demonstrates a unique dimerization through external molecular binding is reported. A trispap ligand with multiple inward chelating units realized the alignment of the metals and coordination sites. Replacement of the original acetate cap with phosphate anion, PO43&#8722;, which binds to the complex in a tripodal mode, generated an electrically&#8208;neutral moiety with available sites and facilitated dimer formation.







Abstract
Macrocyclic complexes with spatially&#8208;arranged coordination sites have the potential to create unique supramolecular systems that combine the precise switching of self&#8208;assembled structures with the coordinative recognition of specific molecules. We now report a macrocyclic trinuclear Zn complex that undergoes a unique dimerization by molecular binding from the outside. The multinuclear complex was synthesized from a trispap ligand, a designed macrocyclic trimer of an N,N,O&#8208;type tridentate chelating unit pap. This macrocyclic ligand is capable of fixing the metal centers and retaining their exchangeable coordination sites. The macrocyclic trimer reacts with zinc acetate to form the trinuclear complex, in which the coordination sites of the three zinc atoms are aligned perpendicular to the macrocyclic plane and capped with the acetates. Subsequently, phosphate anion, PO43&#8722;, coordinates from one side of the macrocycle in a tripodal manner. This phosphate binding produced an electrically&#8208;neutral complex moiety with available coordination sites on the other side of the macrocycle which leads to the formation of the coordination&#8208;bridged dimer.

Using GPU&#8208;accelerated molecular dynamics, V. Mar&#233;chal, J.&#8208;P. Piquemal and co&#8208;workers have modeled the structural dynamics of the PKM2 and PKM1 enzymes. Performing over 6&#8197;&#956;s of simulation with the AMOEBA polarizable force field, they identified key structural properties of the proteins binding sites and determined new cryptic pockets for potential antiviral/antitumoral further designs.

Nitrocyclopropanes, a special class of donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes, are considered to be stepping stones in organic synthesis. Due to the versatile nature of the nitro group, they can be converted into other functional heterocyclic or scaffolds of higher structural complexity to provide access to biologically active molecules. In their Review (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202404791), A.&#8197;G. Chaidali, M.&#8197;A. Terzidis and I.&#8197;N. Lykakis have gathered and categorised the various synthetic methodologies based on the origin of the nitro group. The results of an application&#8208;focused analysis highlight the importance of nitrocyclopropanes as key intermediates.

         <title>Nitrocyclopropanes as Valuable Building Blocks in Organic Synthesis and Biology: Exploring the Origin of the Nitro Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 20, April 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the synthetic methodologies of the nitro&#8208;substituted Donor&#8208;Acceptor cyclopropanes (NCPs). Particularly from nitroalkenes including the Michael Initiated Ring Closure and the Oxidative Ring Closure of Michael Adducts, from Diazo Compounds bearing Nitro Group, from Nitromethane and its Derivatives; and after Oxidation of Aminocyclopropanes or after Cyclopropanation of Miscellaneous Nitro Compounds. The applications described include their Reduction to Aminocyclopropane Carboxylic Acids or Esters, Ring Opening, and Ring Expansion.







Abstract
Cyclopropane derivatives serve as important building blocks in organic synthesis, due to their three&#8208;membered stretched ring. Nitro&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes (NCPs) represent a special class of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes (DACs) that contain a strong electron&#8208;withdrawing nitro group as substituent on the cyclopropyl moiety. Due to the versatile nature of the nitro group, which can be converted into other functional azo groups or heterocyclic scaffolds, NCPs are considered important building blocks in the design of complex organic compounds. Herein, the present review is organized in two main sections focused on the synthesis and application of NCPs. The part containing the synthetic methodologies of NCPs has been further divided into distinct sections based mainly on the nature of the starting materials, such as: a) from nitroalkenes, b) from nitro&#8208;bearing diazo compounds, c) from nitroalkanes in combination with alkenes, d) from aminocyclopropanes under oxidative conditions, and e) from various nitro compounds, through miscellaneous processes. In the part concerning the applications and use of NCPs, the categorization includes three main subcategories, concerning their reduction to 1&#8208;aminocyclopropane&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylic acids (ACC), the ring opening of NCPs leading to valuable open&#8208;chain heterocycles, and the ring expansion to larger cyclic and heterocyclic compounds.

         <title>Adding Value into Elementary Sulfur for Sustainable Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 20, April 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advancements in synthesis strategy that leverage sulfur and sulfur&#8208;based reactions to produce sustainable materials. The materials have promising applications across energy, optics, engineering, and environmental sectors, offering a forward&#8208;looking perspective on the opportunities and challenges shaping this rapidly evolving field.







Abstract
Sulfur&#8208;rich copolymers, characterized by high sulfur contents and dynamic disulfide bonds, show significant promise as sustainable alternatives to conventional carbon&#8208;based plastics. Since the advent of inverse vulcanization in 2013, numerous synthesis strategies have emerged &#8211; ranging from thermopolymerization and photoinduced polymerization to the use of crosslinkers such as mercaptans, episulfides, benzoxazines, and cyclic disulfides. These advancements coupled with the rising demand for degradable plastics have driven research for diverse applications, including optical windows, metal uptake, and adhesives. Due to the unique electronic properties of sulfur&#8208;rich materials, they are promising candidates for cathodes in Li&#8722;S batteries and triboelectric nanogenerators. This review highlight the latest exciting ways of synthesis strategy in which sulfur and sulfur&#8208;based reactions are bing utilized to produce sustainable materials in energy, optics, engeneering material, environemtal, and triboelectric nanogenerators. Finally, this review provides a forward&#8208;looking perspective on the opportunities and challenges shaping this rapidly evolving field.

         <title>Monitoring On&#8208;Surface Chemical Reactions by Low&#8208;Energy Electron Microscopy: from Conformation Change to Ring Closure in 2D Molecular Gas</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 20, April 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Employing on&#8208;surface synthesis we may prepare molecules that are not achievable otherwise. We follow the intramolecular ring&#8208;closure reaction on the Au(111) surface by low&#8208;energy electron microscopy and show that it takes place in the 2D molecular gas phase at elevated temperatures. This provides a key insight for understanding the mechanism of on&#8208;surface reactions.







Abstract
On&#8208;surface synthesis is a promising strategy for the preparation of molecules that are not achievable otherwise. Understanding the mechanism of on&#8208;surface reactions requires knowledge of the molecular structure and possible organization of reactants into supramolecular assemblies during the reaction. Scanning probe techniques are essential for the unambiguous identification of the products and for determining their electronic and magnetic properties. However, these are generally not capable of imaging the surface at reaction conditions and, therefore, answering some of the key questions about the reaction mechanism. Here, we show that real&#8208;time low&#8208;energy electron microscopy (LEEM) can monitor the surface processes in real time and provide the necessary complementary mechanistic insights into on&#8208;surface reactions. We monitor the intramolecular ring&#8208;closure reaction of 1,3,5&#8208;tris(7&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;carbolin&#8208;6&#8208;yl)benzene on the Au(111) surface and show that it takes place in the 2D molecular gas phase at elevated temperatures. Products condense into separate islands upon cooling, enabling fast and efficient assessment of product yields. This makes LEEM an efficient tool for studying intramolecular chemical reactions.

         <title>On the Facile Synthesis of Triazaarsoles Using Acyclic Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Easily accessible dichloroarsanes are suitable precursors for the synthesis of novel triazaarsoles, the arsenic analogues of tetrazoles and triazaphospholes. Our findings pave the way to access and fully investigate such aromatic arsenic heterocycles in detail.








Abstract
Easily accessible dichloroarsanes are suitable precursors for the synthesis of rarely explored triazaarsoles, the arsenic analogues of tetrazoles and triazaphospholes. Calculations on the DFT level gave insight into the electronic structure of such planar compounds, indicating a high degree of aromaticity. Our preliminary investigations pave the way for accessing and investigating a whole variety of new heterocycles that contain a low&#8208;coordinated arsenic atom.

         <title>Scrambled RGD hexameric peptide hydrogel supports efficient self&#8208;assembly and cell activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amino acid sequence is crucial in controlling peptide&#8208;based hydrogel formation, whereby changing the position of a single amino acid can significantly alter the gel&#8217;s properties. Herein, we report the gelation kinetics and cell viability of scrFmoc&#8208;GFFRDG (where we have scrambled the RGD&#8208;based gel hexapeptide; Fmoc&#8208;GFFRGD). The scrambled sequence showed improved gelation properties compared to the original Fmoc&#8208;GFFRGD sequence with scrFmoc&#8208;GFFRDG forming a gel in under 10 minutes, significantly faster than the 2&#8208;hour gelation time, and at a concentration eight times lower than the original Fmoc&#8208;GFFRGD sequence. We also examined the combination of the two gelators in a ratio of 1:1, final concentration of 0.4% (w/v). Interestingly, the stiffness of hybrid hydrogel was ~3 kPa, whereas individually, neither gelator at the same concentration exceeded 0.5 kPa. The cell&#8208;adhesion motif RGD improves the ability of the peptides to promote attachment of cells due to integrin recognition. However, when fibroblasts were cultured on the hydrogels, the scrFmoc&#8208;GFFRDG yielded a higher level of &#945;&#8208;SMA expression in cells than those cultured on Fmoc&#8208;GFFRGD, suggesting a microenvironment conducive to myofibroblast transitions. This study provides a new outlook on how a well&#8208;known scrambled peptide motif (RDG) can fine&#8208;tune hydrogel assembly and cell culture applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Preassembly&#8208;Controlled Radical Recombination at Bismuth: Decarboxylative C&#8211;N Coupling with Sulfonamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Persistent transition metal radicals form the foundation for many metallaphotoredox protocols. Their ability to efficiently trap organic radicals and convert them into various coupling products has inspired the exploration of selective radical reactions even beyond the d&#8208;block. Radical processes involving bismuth hold great potential but innovative strategies are required to control the reactivity of bismuth intermediates. Herein we report preassembly as a powerful strategy to enforce a selective recombination of a bismuth(II) radical and an organic radical. As a result, an inner&#8208;sphere pathway is accessed, enabling the formation of C&#8211;N coupling products.</dc:description>

         <title>A Vibration&#8208;Induced Emission&#8208;Based Ratiometric Sensor for Detection of Anions in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sensors that respond to anions via vibration&#8208;induced emission (VIE) have recently emerged as effective tools for discrimination between closely related carboxylate species in non&#8208;competitive, organic solvents. However, the utility of this sensing mechanism has not yet been demonstrated for anions in aqueous media. Here, we prepared two sensors, monoZnDPA&#8208;DPAC and ZnDPA&#8208;DPAC, with either one or two anion&#8208;binding motifs. These systems are capable of binding to anions in water. Dual emission via VIE is maintained in solvent mixtures of up to 70% water. ZnDPA&#8208;DPAC provides a unique, ratiometric response to citrate and phosphate, which was used for the accurate quantification of aqueous solutions of these anions.</dc:description>

         <title>Designed Metal&#8208;Free Quasi&#8208;1D Crystals with Giant Birefringence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Birefringence, a vital property of anisotropic crystals, is indispensable for advanced optical technologies. Quasi&#8211;one&#8211;dimensional (quasi&#8211;1D) structures, with their inherent structural anisotropy, offer fertile ground for discovering materials with exceptional optical anisotropy. In this work, we report four metal&#8211;free quasi&#8211;1D crystals&#8212;(C5H6NO)+(NO3)&#8211; (4HPN), (C5H6NO)+(HC2O4)&#8211; (4HPO), (C4N3H6)+(NO3)&#8211; (2APMN), and (C4N3H6)+(HC2O4)&#8211;&#183;H2O (2APMO)&#8212;designed to feature pseudo&#8208;chain structures and grown as centimeter&#8211;scale crystals via a facile aqueous&#8208;solution method. These crystals display wide bandgaps (3.40&#8211;4.48 eV) and exceptional birefringence, with calculated values up to 0.555@546 nm and an experimental maximum of 0.597@546 nm for 4HPN. The giant birefringence stems from their quasi&#8208;1D architectures, high spatial density, and optimal arrangement of the birefringence&#8211;active groups (BAGs). This study highlights the promise of metal&#8211;free quasi&#8211;1D materials for next&#8208;generation miniaturized polarization optics and laser&#8211;driven applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Immunological and Toxicological Assessment of Triterpenoid Saponins Bearing Lewis&#8208;X&#8208; and QS&#8208;21&#8208;Based Trisaccharides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The search for safer and more effective vaccine adjuvants has intensified in recent years, with triterpenoid saponins like QS&#8208;21 and its analogues emerging as promising candidates. We report the synthesis of a novel QS&#8208;21 analogue featuring betulinic acid as aglycone, a lupane&#8208;type triterpenoid with low toxicity derived from white birch bark. Two convergent synthetic routes, involving different protecting groups and glycosyl donors (bromide and trichloroacetimidate), were optimized to construct the QS&#8208;21&#8208;based linear trisaccharide motif critical for adjuvant activity. This strategy also enabled efficient preparation of the structurally similar echinocystic acid analogue reported by Gin. The immunological and toxicological profiles of these chimeric saponins, along with Lewis&#8208;X&#8208;containing and rhamnose&#8208;modified derivatives, were evaluated in C57BL/6 wild&#8208;type and hDC&#8208;SIGN transgenic mice. While the synthetic saponins exhibited low toxicity in vitro and in vivo, replacing echinocystic acid with betulinic acid reduced immunogenicity when tested with ovalbumin as a model antigen compared to alhydrogel and QS&#8208;21. These findings provide a foundation for developing saponin&#8208;based adjuvants and demonstrate the utility of advanced glycosylation strategies for synthesizing complex unnatural triterpenoid saponins.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a novel and green approach for Pd&#8208;catalyzed Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination, assisted by IR irradiation under quasi&#8208;solvent&#8208;free conditions, in a non&#8208;anhydrous environment, and without the exclusion of air. The C&#8211;N coupling reactions, performed with a stoichiometric amount of cyclopentyl methyl ether, proceed with moderate to good yields using aryl iodides and bromides bearing both electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, along with a variety of secondary and primary amines.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure and Photoluminescence Properties of EuSiN2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the europium nitridosilicate, EuSiN2 a novel member of the multifaceted MSiN2 family is presented and compared with the structural similar compounds MSiN2 (M = Ca, Sr, Ba). A different way of presenting the structure as M&#8208;N polyhedra layers is introduced.
The crystal structure of EuSiN2, being isotypical to SrSiN2, was determined and refined based on powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data in space group P21/c (no. 14) with a = 5.96381(2)&#197;, b = 7.25982(3)&#197;, c = 5.488338(19)&#197;, &#946; = 113.33&#176;, V = 218.18(5)&#197;3 and Z = 4.
As the Eu2+&#8208;doped MSiN2 compounds show excellent luminescence properties as LED phosphors, the luminescence behavior of dark red emitting EuSiN2 has been investigated as well. Two emission peaks are visible at 708 nm and 764 nm.
Many europium doped nitridosilicates show more or less developed shoulders for their luminescence peaks, but two clearly shaped emission peaks are a novel feature for nitridosilicates.
Comprehensive and detailed comparisons are given and discussed based on works in literature.
The chromaticity coordinate positions of EuSiN2 in the CIE 1931 diagram are x = 0.678 and y = 0.284.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A unified electrochemical decarboxylative strategy for the site&#8208;selective construction of carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds is disclosed herein. The metal&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free decarboxylation provides access to functionalization of C&#8208; and N&#8208;terminus from simple amino acid feedstock. A wide variety of primary, secondary and tertiary acids or alcohols were well tolerated. Late stage functionalization using &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;galactopyranose, di&#8208;peptide, steroids derivatives and bio&#8208;active drug molecules established the robustness and synthesis potential of our approach.</dc:description>

The metal- and catalyst-free decarboxylation provides access to functionalization of C- and N-terminus from simple amino acid feedstock. A wide variety of primary, secondary and tertiary acids or alcohols were well tolerated. Late stage functionalization using &#945;-D-galactopyranose, di-peptide, steroids derivatives and bio-active drug molecules established the robustness and synthesis potential of our approach.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Click Conjugates of Artificial Ribonucleases: Sequence Specific Cleavage with Multiple Turnover</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The azido modified RNA cleaving catalyst 2 has been attached to oligonucleotides containing alkyne linkers in a central position. The resulting conjugates hybridize specifically with complementary RNA strands and cleave them with multiple substrate turnover. RNA half&#8208;lives are in the range of 6&#8208;7 h (pH 8, 37 &#176;C). Some well placed LNA nucleotides can further increase substrate affinities and reaction rates significantly (t&#189; of 3.5 h, kobs = 0.20 h&#8208;1). RNA cleavage does not require metal ions and runs equally well in the presence of EDTA. Fragments of precisely defined lengths are formed, well suited for subsequent analysis by mass spectrometry and related bioanalytical techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>Coexistence of the Perfluorinated Cp* Anion with Oxidizing and Electrophilic Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The&#160;air&#8208; and water stable perfluorinated Cp* [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; &#160;is presented as a candidate for the vastly underexplored group of weakly coordinating carbanions (WCCAs). Its extreme electron deficiency combined with the stabilization of the negative charge within an aromatic system results in a low basicity, yielding a very weak coordination ability. As Cp anions usually possess a strongly pronounced carbanionic character, the perfluorinated Cp* resembles an extraordinary exception for both the WCA and Cp chemistry.&#160; However, the coordination ability remains ambivalent due to the substitution lability of many of its complexes, allowing for the formation of unique ligand&#8208;WCA switches. Due to the low reactivity, there is a need for new transfer reagents containing the perfluorinated Cp* in combination with reactive cations. Thus, we report the synthesis and complete characterization of [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; salts with hydride&#8208;accepting [(C6H5)3C]+, valuable Ag(I) reagents, oxidizing [Fe(C5H5)2]+ or [N(p&#8208;C6H4Br)3]+ and Br&#248;nsted acidic [H(m,m&#8208;NC5H3F2)2]+. Notably, these unprecedented ion pairs are exclusively accessible and stabilized by the low coordination affinity and pronounced oxidative resistance of the perfluorinated Cp*.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Polymeric Dispersants on the Dissolution Rate of Tricalcium Silicate and the Nucleation of Calcium&#8208;Silicate&#8208;Hydrate and Portlandite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycarboxylate ether (PCE) and polyphosphate ether (PPE) dispersants (known as superplasticizers) are indispensable components of modern concrete mix designs. PCEs and PPEs cause retardation of the cement hydration as a secondary effect which causes delayed concrete strength development. It is proposed that the retardation is caused by the polymer influence on the tricalcium silicate dissolution rate and the crystallization of the hydration products (e.g., calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)2 and&#160; calcium&#8208;silicate&#8208;hydrate C&#8208;S&#8208;H). This study examines the effect of four different polymeric superplasticizers with carboxylate and phosphate groups on the reaction kinetics of the pure cement phase tricalcium silicate (in cement shorthand C3S). Our results confirm the strong retarding effect of the polymers on the hydration reaction of the C3S paste. Based on model experiments, we studied the polymer influence on the dissolution of C3S and the nucleation of the hydration products. We observed no C3S dissolution inhibiting effect of the polymers at the chosen concentrations and undersaturation. However, such an inhibiting effect may occur as the saturation limit is approached. Titrimetric analyses indicate that all polymers suppress the nucleation of portlandite and C&#8208;S&#8208;H, with a higher polymer charge density leading to a more pronounced inhibition.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Supramolecular Adhesives Based on Natural Small Molecules Through Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of ionic supramolecular adhesives based on polydisulfide polymers was constructed to achieve ultra&#8208;low dosage, enhanced adhesion performance, multi&#8208;environmental tolerance, and on&#8208;demand adhesion release. These properties are attributed to the intrinsic ordered polymer network structure and small molecule doping, which stabilizes the network and reduces chain entanglement.








Abstract
The environmental persistence and widespread application of conventional polymer adhesives raise critical concerns regarding network design complexity and long&#8208;term residue accumulation. Herein, we present a water&#8208;soluble supramolecular adhesive synthesized from natural small molecules. Unlike traditional polymer networks relying on weak intermolecular forces, this system establishes a robust ordered architecture through dynamic disulfide bond ring&#8208;opening polymerization and carboxylate ion electrostatic interactions. Water&#8208;soluble hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) strategically increases hydrogen&#8208;bonding site density while stabilizing the network topology, efficiently reducing chain entanglement. These synergistic effects endow the material with strong adhesion capability even at minimal usage (&#8764;0.4&#160;mg/cm2), achieving a maximum adhesion strength capable of supporting up to 107 times its weight while maintaining considerable resistance to various environmental factors, including thermal extremes (&#8722;80&#176;C to 120&#176;C) and exposure to organic solvents. This supramolecular design paradigm offers an eco&#8208;friendly alternative to conventional polymeric adhesives.

         <title>Synthesis of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;Dinaphthyl Amino Acids: Towards Molecular Gearing in Peptides and Mini&#8208;Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amino acids bearing two aromatic side chains are studied here for their ability to align in rotor&#8208;like assemblies in a synthetic protein. Based on quantitative analysis of 1H NMR reference nuclei, we investigate a correlated molecular rotor&#8208;type behavior whose dynamic nature stands in remarkable contrast to established systems in the field of molecular bionics.








Abstract
We report the synthesis of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;dinaphthyl amino acids by directed CH&#8208;activation and their subsequent utilization in peptides. The synthesis of aromatic &#946;&#8208;branched amino acids is limited by sterical crowding for large aromatic ring systems. The amino acids are transformed into adequately protected building blocks for solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis by using our amide weakening strategy. Our aim was to study the interactions of the side chain aryl groups in solution and solid state. Based on quantitative analysis of 1H NMR reference nuclei, we investigate conformational equilibria and compare them to established gearing systems.

         <title>Constructing AgO/Ag2O Electrocatalysts with Highly Exposed and Tightly Contacted Active Facets for Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of Ag&#8208;based electrode with the highly exposed and tightly contacted AgO (&#8722;111) and Ag2O (111) active facets was constructed for efficient electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction. This work can help understand the effects of crystal orientation and crystal face interface on electrocatalytic activity.







Abstract
The development of efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the elucidation of their underlying mechanisms are crucial for overcoming the low efficiency of hydrogen production through the electrolysis of water. Utilizing the electrochemical anodic oxidation method, a series of silver&#8208;based electrocatalysts (Ag&#8208;x, where x signifies the applied direct current (DC) voltage, x=0, 5, 10, 15) were prepared employing metallic silver wire as the anode under DC voltages. The resulting silver&#8208;based electrodes have been oxidized and reconstructed, yielding AgO/Ag2O composite on the surface. Notably, the Ag&#8208;10 electrode exhibited the lowest overpotential (399&#8197;mV at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 456&#8197;mV at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), along with good stability. The superior OER performance of Ag&#8208;10 is not only attributed to the high exposure and tight interface of the AgO (&#8722;111) and Ag2O (111) crystal phases, as well as the higher prevalence of Ag&#8722;O&#8722;O&#8722;Ag species on its surface, but also its larger electrochemical active surface area (ECSA). This work provides insight for the synthesis of metal oxide&#8208;based electrocatalysts and understanding the electrocatalytic mechanism.

         <title>Exploring Tyramine's Role in the Formation of Supramolecular Adducts with Nonsteroidal Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Drugs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An a priori design approach identified tyramine as an ideal co&#8208;former for obtaining new supramolecular adducts with nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs, speeding up the co&#8208;crystallization process. Three novel adducts and a new polymorphic form were synthesized and thoroughly characterized by solid&#8208;state NMR and single&#8208;crystal XRD. The resulting adducts showed an improved equilibrium aqueous solubility.








Abstract
In pharmaceutical crystal engineering, salification and co&#8208;crystallization are well&#8208;established strategies to enhance the physicochemical properties of nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which typically exhibit low aqueous solubility. This study introduces three new multicomponent crystalline systems of NSAIDs (S&#8208;naproxen, flurbiprofen, and ketoprofen) with the co&#8208;former tyramine, designed using knowledge&#8208;based methods. Additionally, a new polymorph of the diflunisal&#8211;tyramine system, synthesized via mechanochemical techniques, is reported. The new multicomponent systems were thoroughly characterized using solid&#8208;state NMR and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Aqueous solubility tests conducted through solution 1H NMR experiments revealed increased equilibrium solubility for all samples, highlighting the efficacy of crystal engineering in modulating the physicochemical properties of drugs.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Phosphinidene Manganese Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;phosphinidene (NHCP) manganese complex [(NHC)PMn(CO)4] undergoes CO substitution reactions via an associative mechanism akin to the nitrosyl complex [Mn(NO)(CO)4], with the (NHC)P ligand, switching between three&#8208;electron and one&#8208;electron donor modes. Phosphinidene transfer and chalcogenation reactions along the Mn&#8211;P double bond afford metalladiphosphiranes and metallaphosphachalcogeniranes with three&#8208;membered MnPE rings.








Abstract
The reaction of manganese pentacarbonyl bromide with the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;phosphinidene adduct (IDipp)PSiMe3 afforded the tetracarbonyl complex [(IDipp)PMn(CO)4] (1) with the release of Me3SiBr and CO (IDipp = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene). X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis revealed a trigonal&#8208;bipyramidal coordination geometry with a short Mn&#9472;P bond, indicative of double bond character. CO substitution with phosphines, NHCs, and isocyanides yielded complexes [(IDipp)PMnL(CO)3] (2&#8211;5) in which the ligands (L) occupy axial positions. Kinetic studies and DFT calculations support an associative substitution mechanism, analogous to the nitrosyl complex [Mn(NO)(CO)4], demonstrating the ability of (NHC)P and NO ligands to modulate their electronic properties as either one&#8208; or three&#8208;electron donors. Complex 1 also underwent phosphinidene transfer and chalcogenation reactions along the manganese&#8208;phosphorus bond, resulting in metalladiphosphiranes (6, 7) and metallaphospha&#8208;chalcogeniranes (8, 9) with three&#8208;membered MnPP and MnPE (E = Se, Te) rings.

This study demonstrates a photocatalytic aerobic ring scission of indenes into dicarbonyl intermediates for efficient synthesis of isoquinoline derivatives via condensation/rearomatization event using NH4OAc as N source. Besides, naphthalene derivatives also can be archived through an elegant C atom insertion. Mechanistic studies reveal superoxide anion&#8208;mediated C&#9552;C cleavage rather than singlet oxygen

Abstract
In this study, we present a photocatalyzed single&#8208;atom insertion of indenes, involving an aerobic ring scission into dicarbonyl intermediates, which subsequently undergo condensation and rearomatization to efficiently synthesize isoquinoline and naphthalene derivatives. The use of an inexpensive organic dye as the photocatalyst under aerobic conditions with cheap ammonium acetate (NH4OAc) as the nitrogen source makes this method very practical and environmentally friendly to access isoquinoline. Alternatively, an intramolecular carbon&#8208;atom&#8208;insertion process, involving the Aldol reaction of the dicarbonyl intermediates, affords the naphthalenamine and naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol derivatives. Mechanistic studies support that the superoxide anion radical species mediates the C&#9552;C double bond scission of indenes rather than the singlet oxygen intermediate.

         <title>Molecular Rectangles Featuring Two Parallel NCN&#8208;Coordinated Platinum Units: Enhancing Near&#8208;Infrared Emission Through Excimer Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macro&#8208;cycling into the near&#8208;infrared: By incorporating two cyclometallated Pt(II) units into opposite sides of a molecular rectangle, the formation of near&#8208;infrared&#8208;emitting excited states that span the two units is promoted in solution, compared to the corresponding, acyclic, tweezer&#8208;like complexes. A degree of molecular reorganization is nevertheless required to form such states, which is inhibited in more rigid media.








Abstract
New macrocyclic molecules are described that incorporate Pt(NCN) units on opposite edges of a rectangular structure, with xanthene units constituting the other two sides. Here, NCN represents a cyclometallating tridentate ligand based on 2,6&#8208;di(2&#8208;pyridyl)benzene or its pyrimidine analog. The complexes display strong photoluminescence peaking in the near&#8208;infrared region of the spectrum in solution (&#955;max up to 761&#160;nm). Photophysical data and DFT calculations indicate that the emission arises from &#8220;intramolecular excimers&#8221;&#8212;triplet excited states that form when the two Pt(NCN) units within the molecule are brought into close proximity to interact interfacially. In doped polymers, the necessary molecular distortion is inhibited, but related excited states that emit in a similar region can still form through intermolecular interactions.

Here, &lt;i&gt;NCN&lt;/i&gt; represents a cyclometallating tridentate ligand based on 2,6-di(2-pyridyl)benzene or its pyrimidine analog. The complexes display strong photoluminescence peaking in the near-infrared region of the spectrum in solution (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; up to 761&#160;nm). Photophysical data and DFT calculations indicate that the emission arises from &#8220;intramolecular excimers&#8221;&#8212;triplet excited states that form when the two Pt(&lt;i&gt;NCN&lt;/i&gt;) units within the molecule are brought into close proximity to interact interfacially. In doped polymers, the necessary molecular distortion is inhibited, but related excited states that emit in a similar region can still form through intermolecular interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anisotropic Thermal Expansion of an Adaptive Ni Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with One&#8208;Dimensional Helical Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are gradually becoming an ideal platform for investigating negative thermal expansion (NTE) owing to their designability and framework flexibility. In this work, we studied the thermal expansion phenomenon of the orthorhombic [Ni(L&#8208;cam)(4,4'&#8208;bpe)]n (L&#8208;cam = L&#8208;camphoric acid and 4,4'&#8208;bpe = 4,4'&#8208;vinylenedipyridine) with one&#8208;dimensional helical chains through thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, variable temperature powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and variable temperature single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The synergistic effect of the lateral thermal vibrations of bpe and the spring&#8208;like stretching thermal motion elucidated the mechanism of NTE along the c&#8208;axis. The positive thermal expansion (PTE) along the b&#8208;axis can be attributed to the spring&#8208;like stretching thermal motion of the helical chains. The a&#8208;axis was nearly unchanged exhibiting zero thermal expansion. The PTE happened in the unit cell volume due to the larger deformation along the b&#8208;axis compared to the c&#8208;axis. This study deepens our comprehension to the NTE of three&#8208;dimensional MOFs and provides a point of view for the design and synthesis in the development and investigation of other NTE materials.</dc:description>

In this work, we studied the thermal expansion phenomenon of the orthorhombic [Ni(L-cam)(4,4'-bpe)]n (L-cam = L-camphoric acid and 4,4'-bpe = 4,4'-vinylenedipyridine) with one-dimensional helical chains through thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, variable temperature powder X-ray diffraction, and variable temperature single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The synergistic effect of the lateral thermal vibrations of bpe and the spring-like stretching thermal motion elucidated the mechanism of NTE along the c-axis.

         <title>High Drug Loading Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based Nanodrug Delivery System Enhances Anticancer Efficacy and Reduces Toxicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanodrug delivery is a critical approach in cancer therapy; however, the deposition of excipients often exacerbates the toxic burden of drugs. Herein, a pillar[5]arene&#8208;based supramolecular nanodrug delivery system (WP5&#8835;C6Py@DOX) has been developed to enhance cancer therapy efficacy while minimizing side effects. This system, constructed through host&#8208;guest interactions between a thioether&#8208;modified pillar[5]arene derivative (WP5) and a pyridinium salt derivative (C6Py), exhibited a remarkable 97% drug loading capacity for doxorubicin (DOX). It showed remarkable stability in both aqueous solutions and bovine serum, effectively minimizing premature drug leakage and reducing associated toxicity. The thioether modification of WP5 reacted with H2O2 to generate derivatives with improved water solubility, significantly enhancing biocompatibility while minimizing excipient deposition within endosomes. Cellular experiments revealed that the system not only reduced the toxicity of DOX to normal cells (BEAS&#8208;2B) but also significantly enhanced its antitumor activity against cancer cells (HepG2), with an IC50 of 1.2 &#956;M, markedly outperforming free DOX (IC50: 6.3 &#956;M). Furthermore, laser confocal imaging confirmed that the supramolecular drug delivery system effectively enters and accumulates in cancer cells, demonstrating promising therapeutic potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Interesting Aromaticity of Franck&#8208;Condon Excited States of Cyclo[16]carbon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by the realization of cyclo[16]carbon (C16) and driven by curiosity about its properties in excited states, a comprehensive theoretical study was conducted on the aromatic characteristics in the Franck&#8208;Condon states of C16. This work demonstrates that at the ground&#8208;state (S0 state) geometry, C16 exhibits aromaticity not only in the triplet states (T1(in&#8594;out), T2(out&#8594;out), and T3(in&#8594;in)), but also more prominently in the quintet&#160;state (Q1 state), and different electronic transition modes result in different essential sources of aromaticity for each excited state. Quantitatively, C16 is about three times more aromatic in the quintet&#160;state than in the triplet states.&#160;These conclusions are supported by multiple robust indicators such as atomic force, induced current, and magnetic shielding, from qualitative, quantitative, and graphical perspectives.</dc:description>

         <title>FeOHSO4@C Cathode with Low Strain and High Pseudocapacitance for Advanced Potassium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron&#8208;based polyanionic cathode materials in potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) have appealed to an increasing number of interest due to these advantages of low cost, environmental friendliness and excellent structural stability. However, these inherent drawbacks of inferior electronic conductivity and terrible nanostructural stability hinder its practical application. Here we report a novel low&#8208;strain iron&#8208;based polyanion&#8208;type cathode material FeOHSO4@C for KIBs. In this work, the surface of FeOHSO4&#160;nanoparticles are well carbon encapsulated, carbon coating layer with large surface area and excellent electrical conductivity is ~2.5 nm in thick, which can not only inhibits the aggregation and growth between&#160;FeOHSO4@C nanoparticles during charging and discharging, but also provides a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) electronic conductive framework that activates electrochemical reactivity. As a result, the FeOHSO4@C cathode exhibits outstanding potassium storage capacity (capacity retention of 80.95% over 200 cycles at 20 mA g&#8208;1) attributed to a low&#8208;strain mechanism for K+&#160;uptake/removal, high pseudocapacitance, as well as 3D electronic conductive framework. Operando XRD&#160;and ex situ&#160;XPS analyses revealed a single phase reaction route of orthorhombic FeOHSO4@C during cycling.</dc:description>

         <title>Chlorosulfenic Acid: An Important Linker in the Coupled Sulfur and Chlorine Chemistry in the Venusian Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The coupled sulfur and chlorine chemistry plays an important role in the chemical cycle of the Venusian atmosphere. However, the reactivity of the abundant sulfur monoxide (SO) toward hydrochloric acid (HCl) in the Venusian atmosphere remains hitherto unknown. In this work, we report the generation, spectroscopic characterization, and photochemistry of chlorosulfenic acid (HOSCl), a simple molecule that acts not only as a potential candidate for the near&#8208;UV absorber but also as an important linker in the coupled sulfur and chlorine chemistry in the Venusian atmosphere. This molecule has bright absorption from 330 to 440 nm. The photochemistry of HOSCl at 365 nm yields SO and HCl as a novel hydrogen&#8208;bonded molecular complex in a cryogenic Ar&#8208;matrix at 10 K, and the subsequent irradiation at 193 nm leads to recombination of the two fragments by reformation of HOSCl. The photochemistry of HOSCl underscores its importance in the photochemical models of the sulfur and chlorine species in Venusian atmosphere.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Assemblies of Unsymmetric Pt Complexes with Ag ions: Two Types of Assembly Modes Depending on the Remote Ancillary Groups in the Bridging Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly via noncovalent interactions can amplify small structural differences in small molecular units, producing large supramolecular architectures with structure&#8208;dependent complexities and characteristics. In this paper, the unique self&#8208;assembly behaviors of mononuclear Pt(II) complex units accommodating Ag(I) ions are reported. The Pt complex with the N^C chelating ligand and two different kinds of pyrazole ligands gave two regioisomers, whose structural difference was only the position of the N and C donor atoms in the N^C chelating ligands. This small structural difference influences the assembled structures with Ag ions, producing two different types of heteropolynuclear complexes with different clustering motifs. This was further amplified via a hierarchical assembly process incorporating additional Ag ions to afford two different types of Pt&#8208;Ag cluster&#8208;of&#8208;cluster complexes. This study proves that the self&#8208;assembly of unsymmetrical fragments can endow significant complexity and perturbation in the molecular system, enabling the observation of unique molecular behaviors.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional Gold Super&#8208;Nanoparticle&#8208;Based Nanosystem for SERS&#8208;Guided Oxygen&#8208;Independent Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer treatment remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and hypoxic microenvironment of tumors, which often compromises therapeutic efficacy. To address this issue, a multifunctional gold super&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;based nanosystem (GSPs1,4&#8208;BDT@PDA&#8208;AIPH&#8208;cRGD) was developed for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)&#8208;guided oxygen&#8208;independent phototherapy. This nanosystem integrates diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities through a gold superlattice&#8208;nanoparticle (GSP) core self&#8208;assembled from 5.8 nm gold nanoparticles (GNPs), functionalized with 1,4&#8208;benzenedithiol (1,4&#8208;BDT) as a Raman reporter. The GSPs are encapsulated with a polydopamine (PDA) shell for enhancing their structural stability, Raman signal amplification, and serving as a photothermal agent. The PDA coating is further loaded with 2,2&#8217;&#8208;azobis[2&#8208;(2&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;yl) propane] dihydrochloride (AIPH), a oxygen independent photosensitizer that releases cytotoxic free radicals, and cyclic arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid (cRGD) peptide for tumor targeting. Under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light irradiation, the nanosystem generates hyperthermia and releases free radicals, achieving oxygen&#8208;independent tumor ablation. Real&#8208;time SERS imaging ensures precise tumor monitoring, addressing key challenges in cancer management. This novel approach combines the benefits of highly sensitive SERS imaging, targeted drug delivery, and oxygen independent phototherapy, providing a robust platform for synergistic cancer diagnosis and treatment with significant therapeutic potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Electrochemical Electrodes into Mass Spectrometry Ionization Sources for Detection of Transient Intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Identifying short&#8208;lived transient intermediates is challenging due to their brief lifetimes (as short as nanoseconds, and even picoseconds) and therefore low concentrations in many chemical processes. Conducting electrochemical reactions within mass spectrometry ion sources (i.e., insource or in situ EC&#8208;MS) offers the advantage of minimizing the distance between the electrodes and the mass spectrometer, thereby improving the detection of transient intermediates. However, a key challenge for in&#8208;source EC&#8208;MS is the effective integration of the electrodes into the MS ion sources. This mini&#8208;review highlights three main integration strategies: exploiting inherent electrochemical properties, incorporating a two&#8208; or three&#8208;electrode system, and implementing bipolar electrodes, focusing on the underlying mechanisms, experimental setups, and applications of these approaches. Future perspectives emphasize the directions of designing and modifying ionization sources, integrating electrocatalysis, enhancing transfer efficiency, developing automated screening platforms, as well as expanding practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>[natY/90Y]Yttrium and [natLu/177Lu]Lutetium Complexation by Rigid H4OCTAPA Derivatives. Effect of Ligand Topology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a detailed investigation on the coordination chemistry of [nat/90Y]Y3+ and [nat/177Lu]Lu3+ with the new acyclic chelator H4CHXOITAPA. This octadentate chelator forms nine&#8208;coordinated Y3+ and Lu3+ complexes thanks to the coordination of a water molecule, as demonstrated by the X&#8208;ray structure of [Y(HCHXOITAPA)(H2O)] and 1H, 13C and 89Y NMR studies in solution. These complexes display slightly higher thermodynamic stabilities compared with those of the known H4CHXOCTAPA and H4OCTAPA chelators, reaching log KYL and log KLuL values of 21.24(5) and 21.96(1), respectively. Kinetic studies indicate that these complexes dissociate mainly through the spontaneous and proton&#8208;assisted pathways at pH 7.4. The chelator can be readily radiolabeled with [90Y]Y3+ and [177Lu]Lu3+ at room temperature in 10 min. The radio&#8208;complexes are stable in human serum at 37 &#186;C, in contrast with the analogues of the known H4CHXOCTAPA and H4OCTAPA chelators, which experience significant dissociation under these conditions. Thus, the H4CHXOITAPA chelator represents the most promising candidate among the H4OCTAPA family for the development of 90Y&#8208; and 177Lu&#8208;based radiopharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

         <title>Looking to the Future: Prospective Life Cycle Assessment of Emerging Technologies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores prospective life cycle assessment (pLCA), an emerging methodology for evaluating the environmental impacts of technologies still in development. Key aspects are identified, including assessing technology maturity levels, upscaling methods, and generating future scenarios. Recent case studies are analyzed to guide researchers in implementing robust pLCA frameworks for emerging technologies.








Abstract
Emerging technologies are expected to contribute to sustainable development, but assessing their future environmental impacts compared to current technologies remains challenging. Prospective life cycle assessment (pLCA) provides a systematic approach to evaluating emerging technologies throughout their life cycle and projecting impacts at future industrial scales. This review aims to identify critical aspects of pLCA methodologies and examine their implementation in recent case studies. Key aspects are highlighted: assessment of initial technology maturity, upscaling methods to model data at higher technology readiness levels, and development of future scenarios to contextualize the scaled&#8208;up systems. Specific upscaling techniques such as process simulation, engineering calculations and technology learning curves are discussed. Approaches to generating future scenarios in line with integrated assessment models and common socio&#8208;economic pathways are also analyzed. An in&#8208;depth literature review covering 2021&#8211;2024 publications categorizes 79 articles into literature reviews, methodological papers and pLCA case studies. The identified critical issues serve as a benchmark to assess the completeness and robustness of 20 case studies. Notable contributions, limitations and the need for comprehensive guidelines that integrate scenario development with upscaling methods are highlighted. This review provides valuable insights for researchers conducting pLCA studies of emerging technologies and materials.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light photocatalysis provides sustainable and versatile methods for the synthesis and functionalization of chromene derivatives. This review compiles cutting&#8208;edge methodologies, highlighting transformations such as multicomponent reactions, cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reactions, diverse cascade processes, and Giese&#8208;type additions. The integration of photochemistry with green principles enables more convenient and eco&#8208;friendly access to structurally diverse and biologically significant heterocycles.








Abstract
Chromenes represent a biologically significant family of heterocycles, widely present in pharmaceutical compounds and secondary metabolites. Their importance in synthesis and medicinal chemistry has driven continuous efforts to develop advanced and efficient synthetic methodologies. Over the past decade, photoredox catalysis has revolutionized Organic Synthesis, offering innovative and sustainable strategies for the construction and functionalization of complex molecules. The synthesis of chromene derivatives has greatly benefited from the integration of visible&#8208;light&#8211;promoted methodologies, which utilize light as an abundant and non&#8208;toxic energy source, enabling greener chemical transformations. In this review, the latest progress in visible&#8208;light&#8211;mediated approaches for the synthesis of chromene derivatives, along with the photochemical reactivity of these relevant frameworks, are summarized.

         <title>Hydrophosphanylation of Alkynes via Magnesium Complexes: Evidence for Ligand Dependency in Structure&#8211;Activity Relationships</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Demonstration of a well&#8208;defined magnesium complex achieving the hydrophosphanylation of alkynes and alkenes that delivers a cutting&#8208;edge, eco&#8208;friendly solution for crafting vital C&#9472;P bonds efficiently, beyond transition&#8211;metal catalysts.








Abstract
Pursuing practical, straightforward, and sustainable methods for forming carbon&#8208;phosphorus bonds is crucial in academia and industry. In this study, we showed that bis(diiminate)&#8208;based magnesium complexes [L(Mg&#8208;nBu)2] (nBu&#160;=&#160;n&#8208;butyl) could effectively catalyze the hydrophosphanylation of alkynes, resulting in monophosphanylated vinyledene&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;diphosphanylated alkanes in a stepwise manner. This transformation showcases an excellent atom economy, broad functional group tolerance, and gram&#8208;scale synthesis for organophosphorus compounds. Through controlled experiments and with the support of DFT calculations, we elucidated the reaction mechanism, identifying the active catalytic species and revealing a stepwise hydrophosphanylation process of alkynes. Although complex Mg&#8208;1 showed its potential in this transformation, complexes Mg&#8208;2 and Mg&#8208;3, having ethyl and phenyl spacers, produced a lower yield of hydrophosphanylated products, indicating the role of ligand (spacer) in this catalytic reaction. Further, the activity of Mg&#8208;1 was compared with a monomeric magnesium complex, Mg&#8208;4, and it was found that the performance of the Mg&#8208;4 in alkyne hydrophosphanylation is quite lower than the results obtained by using Mg&#8208;1. This work demonstrated that a dimeric magnesium complex with a suitable spacer can enhance the catalytic activity manyfolds in the hydrophosphanylation of alkynes.

&lt;p&gt;Demonstration of a well-defined magnesium complex achieving the hydrophosphanylation of alkynes and alkenes that delivers a cutting-edge, eco-friendly solution for crafting vital C&#9472;P bonds efficiently, beyond transition&#8211;metal catalysts.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pursuing practical, straightforward, and sustainable methods for forming carbon-phosphorus bonds is crucial in academia and industry. In this study, we showed that bis(diiminate)-based magnesium complexes [L(Mg-&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;Bu)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;Bu&#160;=&#160;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-butyl) could effectively catalyze the hydrophosphanylation of alkynes, resulting in monophosphanylated vinyledene- and 1,2-diphosphanylated alkanes in a stepwise manner. This transformation showcases an excellent atom economy, broad functional group tolerance, and gram-scale synthesis for organophosphorus compounds. Through controlled experiments and with the support of DFT calculations, we elucidated the reaction mechanism, identifying the active catalytic species and revealing a stepwise hydrophosphanylation process of alkynes. Although complex &lt;b&gt;Mg-1&lt;/b&gt; showed its potential in this transformation, complexes &lt;b&gt;Mg-2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Mg-3,&lt;/b&gt; having ethyl and phenyl spacers, produced a lower yield of hydrophosphanylated products, indicating the role of ligand (spacer) in this catalytic reaction. Further, the activity of &lt;b&gt;Mg-1&lt;/b&gt; was compared with a monomeric magnesium complex, &lt;b&gt;Mg-4&lt;/b&gt;, and it was found that the performance of the &lt;b&gt;Mg-4&lt;/b&gt; in alkyne hydrophosphanylation is quite lower than the results obtained by using &lt;b&gt;Mg-1&lt;/b&gt;. This work demonstrated that a dimeric magnesium complex with a suitable spacer can enhance the catalytic activity manyfolds in the hydrophosphanylation of alkynes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Selectively 13C/2H/15N&#8208; Labeled Arginine to Probe Protein Conformation and Interaction by NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We offer a new labeling approach to introduce isolated 15N&#8722;13C&#8722;1H spin systems to the side chains of arginine residues. The labeling scheme delivers high&#8208;resolution NMR spectra to study large protein complexes. The interaction between ubiquitin and the third Src homology 3 domain of yeast protein Sla1 (Sla1 SH3&#8208;3) has been analyzed, highlighting the probes&#8217; competence to sample rapid dynamics.








Abstract
The charged arginine side chain is unique in determining many innate properties of proteins, contributing to stability and interaction surfaces, and directing allosteric regulation and enzymatic catalysis. NMR experiments can be used to reveal these processes at the molecular level, but it often requires selective insertion of carbon&#8208;13, nitrogen&#8208;15, and deuterium at defined atomic positions. We introduce a method to endow arginine residues with defined isotope patterns, combining synthetic organic chemistry and cell&#8208;based protein overexpression. The resulting proteins feature NMR active spin systems with optimized relaxation pathways leading to simplified NMR spectra with a sensitive response to changes in the chemical environment of the nuclei observed.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Deficient Transition Metal Oxynitrides as Anode Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized two new oxynitride compounds Ca4La8V4O8N12 and Sr3La9V4O7N13. The anionic vacancy is more easily formed in the Sr3La9V4O7N13 structure, the influence of the defect level on the energy band is stronger, facilitating electron transition in the structure and enhancing electrical conductivity. This study is of great significance to broaden the wide application of transition metal oxynitrides in the field of electronics.








Abstract
Transition metal oxynitrides, with their unique electronic structures and excellent conductivity, hold significant promise as anode materials in fuel cells. In this study, we synthesized and characterized two novel anion&#8208;deficient transition metal oxynitrides: Ca4La8V4O8N12 and Sr3La9V4O7N13. Their crystal structures were determined via Rietveld refinement of X&#8208;ray and neutron diffraction data, revealing a higher concentration of anion vacancies in Sr3La9V4O7N13. As a result, Sr3La9V4O7N13 exhibits significantly enhanced electrical conductivity compared to Ca4La8V4O8N12. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that Sr3La9V4O7N13 possesses higher defect formation energies, influencing its band structure and facilitating electron transitions, thereby enhancing conductivity. This study underscores the role of anion deficiencies in modulating the electronic properties of transition metal oxynitrides and offers new insights for designing high&#8208;performance anode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Cyclic Imide Extended Diazocines: Tweezer&#8208;Like, Rigid Photoswitches With Large Switching Amplitudes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitches with a perfect tweezer&#8208;like bending motion and a large amplitude of movement are ideally suited as molecular actuators for applications in photoresponsive materials, biomolecules and photopharmacology. For this purpose, the core of the diazocine photoswitch was extended via cyclic imides. The compounds can be easily synthesized and late&#8208;stage functionalized.








Abstract
Diazocines are bridged azobenzenes with improved photophysical properties. One of the main features is the fact that, unlike the azobenzenes, the Z form is more stable than the E isomer. Another important property is the more rigid structure (tricyclic), which precisely defines the molecular movement. The disadvantage of diazocines compared to azobenzenes is the less well&#8208;developed chemistry, particularly regarding the synthesis of derivatives. In this work, we present an approach to preparing diazocine derivatives via a late&#8208;stage functionalization strategy. Two key compounds are used for this purpose: a bis&#8208;anhydride and a bis&#8208;imide of diazocine. They can be further functionalized with both nucleophiles and electrophiles leading to numerous derivatives of diazocine with a large range of functional groups. Due to the extended &#960; systems, the associated larger molecular switching lever, and the defined direction of molecular movement, numerous potential applications in the field of photoswitchable biological systems and photoresponsive materials are conceivable, e.g. photopharmacology, polymer&#8208;based actuators, mechanophores, photoresponsive cages, helicates, MOFs, and COFs.

Self&#8208;assembly of PTFEP55&#8208;b&#8208;PS50 in THF yields diverse nanomorphologies (spheres, bicontinuous, toroids, cylinders, vesicles) by varying concentration. PTFEP crystallinity increases with concentration, driving morphological transitions. Unique intermediates (&#8220;flower&#8208;like,&#8221; LCMs, &#8220;octopi&#8208;like&#8221;) reveal transformation mechanisms, showcasing unprecedented structural diversity and control.








Abstract
In this study, we demonstrate that varying the initial concentration of the poly&#8208;[bis(trifluoroethoxy)phosphazene]&#8208;b&#8208;poly(styrene) (PTFEP55&#8208;b&#8208;PS50) block copolymer enables the formation of diverse, well&#8208;defined nanomorphologies through self&#8208;assembly in tetrahydrofuran (THF). By adjusting the copolymer concentration, spherical micelles (0.1&#160;mg/mL), bicontinuous micelles (0.33&#160;mg/mL), toroidal micelles (2.0&#160;mg/mL), cylindrical micelles (10&#160;mg/mL), and vesicles (50&#160;mg/mL) were successfully prepared. This simple methodology, using a single solvent and no additives, allowed for the investigation of morphological transformation mechanisms. Intermediate structures, such as &#8220;flower&#8208;like&#8221; morphologies (0.66&#160;mg/mL), large compound micelles (LCMs, 1.0&#160;mg/mL), and perforated micelles (1.5&#160;mg/mL), were identified, revealing transitions between bicontinuous and toroidal morphologies. In situ studies captured the opening of toroidal structures into cylindrical micelles, while &#8220;octopi&#8208;like&#8221; structures were observed at intermediate concentrations between cylindrical and vesicular architectures. Wide&#8208;angle x&#8208;ray diffraction (WAXD) analysis showed that PTFEP blocks in the nanostructure cores are amorphous at low concentrations (&lt;&#160;2&#160;mg/mL) but exhibit increasing crystallinity at higher concentrations (&gt;&#160;2&#160;mg/mL), transitioning from toroidal to cylindrical and vesicular morphologies. This work highlights the ability to control the self&#8208;assembly of PTFEP&#8208;b&#8208;PS, generating a wide range of nanomorphologies by modulating PTFEP crystallinity through concentration adjustments. The unprecedented structural diversity of this system underscores its potential for designing advanced nanostructured materials.

         <dc:description>Glycans are vital in biological processes, but their non&#8208;templated, heterogeneous structures complicate structure&#8208;function analyses. Glycosylation, the key reaction in synthetic glycochemistry, remains not entirely predictable due to its complex mechanism and the need for protecting groups that impact reaction outcomes. This Concept highlights recent advancements in glycochemistry and emphasizes the integration of digital tools, including automation, computational modelling, and data management, to improve carbohydrate synthesis and support further progress in the field.</dc:description>

         <title>A Fluorescent Aptasensor for Sensitive and Selective Determination of Epigenetic Cancer Biomarker N1&#8208;methyladenosine in Urine Samples</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N1&#8208;methyladenosine (m1A) level in urine increases in the presence of cancer and is associated with the tumor size and stage. In the present study, we aimed to develop a method for rapid, sensitive and accurate determination of m1A in urine samples. The capture SELEX method was used to isolate aptamers that could selectively bind to m1A. We successfully isolated two sequences that have high selectivity towards m1A. The affinities against m1A were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and thioflavin T (ThT) assays. The N1MA1a aptamer has a Kd of 1.9&#177;0.1 &#181;M determined by the ThT assay and 0.75&#177;0.04 &#181;M determined by ITC. A strand&#8208;displacement biosensor was designed by labeling the aptamer with fluorescein and hybridizing it with a quencher&#8208;labeled complementary DNA strand. Using this biosensing system, m1A was detected with a detection limit of 1.9 &#181;M. The system shows high selectivity to m1A and high tolerance to adenosine, cytidine, guanosine, thymidine, uridine and N6&#8208;methyladenosine as well as urine constituents at their real levels in urine. The sensor has been applied to five different human urine samples showing quantitative recovery values, which indicates practical potential of this aptamer&#8208;based biosensor.</dc:description>

         <title>Making and Breaking Supramolecular Synthons for Modular Protein Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anionic calixarenes are useful mediators of protein assembly. In some cases, protein &#8211; calixarene cocrystallization yields multiple polymorphs. Ralstonia solanacearum lectin (RSL) cocrystallizes with p&#8208;sulfonato&#8208;calix[8]arene (sclx8) in at least four distinct pH&#8208;dependent arrangements. One of these polymorphs, occurring at pH &#8804;4, is a cubic framework in which RSL nodes are connected by sclx8 dimers. These dimers are supramolecular synthons, occurring in distinct crystal structures. Now, we show that the discus&#8208;shaped dimer of p&#8208;phosphonato&#8208;calix[6]arene (pclx6), can replace the sclx8 dimer yielding a new assembly of RSL. Remarkably, just one type of RSL &#8211; pclx6 cocrystal was formed, irrespective of pH or crystallization condition. These results with pclx6 contrast starkly with sclx8 and suggest that the calixarene type (e.g. phosphonate versus sulfonate) dictates the synthon durability, which in turn exerts control over protein assembly and polymorph selection. Breaking the pclx6 dimer required a mutant of RSL with an affinity tag for macrocycle binding. This highly accessible, dicationic site resulted in a significantly altered and porous framework with pclx6 (but not with sclx8). Experiments with ternary mixtures of RSL, pclx6 and sclx8 provide evidence of pH&#8208;driven self&#8208;sorting. Thus, the &#8216;mix&#8208;and&#8208;match&#8217; of protein and supramolecular synthons is a promising approach to protein crystal engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Ammoxidation of Unprotected Glycosides: A One&#8208;Pot Conversion of Alcohols to Nitriles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalized carbohydrates are important in various fields, but protection&#8208;free selective functionalization often remains challenging. We demonstrate that the primary hydroxy group in minimally protected carbohydrates can be directly converted into a nitrile group with TEMPO, PIDA and ammonium acetate. Both nitrile hexopyranoses and nitrile pentofuranoses are obtained and subsequent derivatizations of the nitrile group to other versatile functional groups are demonstrated. Combined evidence from literature and in&#8208;situ reaction progress monitoring with Raman spectroscopy led to the proposal that an iminoiodinane derived from PIDA plays an important role in the mechanism of the ammoxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermally Activated On&#8208;Surface Self&#8208;Metalation of Pd&#8208;Phthalocyanines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phthalocyanines (Pcs) are essential organic molecules with wide&#8208;ranging applications in fields such as catalysis and optoelectronics, owing to their stable aromatic structure and exceptional thermal stability. Equally important is their versatility, which can be achieved by modifying the central metal atom. In this context, metalation&#8212;the process by which a central metal atom is incorporated into the macrocycle&#8212;plays a critical role in tailoring both the electronic and structural properties of Pcs. In this work, we investigate the thermally activated on&#8208;surface synthesis of palladium phthalocyanine (PdPc) by depositing metal&#8208;free phthalocyanine (H2Pc) onto a Pd(001) surface in Ultra&#8208;High Vacuum (UHV) conditions. Using temperature&#8208;dependent X&#8208;Ray Photoemission Spectroscopy (XPS), we analyze the evolution of the N 1s core level signal, confirming the successful formation of PdPc. The appearance of a secondary peak in the Pd 3d core level, attributed to Pd atoms coordinated within the phthalocyanine molecule after metalation, provides further evidence for the PdPc synthesis. Additionally, Near&#8208;Edge X&#8208;Ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS) reveals that no desorption or chemical degradation occurs during the process. We believe this study represents a significant step forward in the scalable synthesis of PdPc, which, like other Pd&#8208;containing organic molecules, holds great potential for applications in catalysis and cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Generation by Cyclisation of an Organic Structure Directing Agent for the Synthesis of High Silica Zeolite ERS&#8208;7</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zeolites with high framework Si/Al ratios are of interest for industrial applications due to their hydrothermal stability. They are usually synthesised in the presence of pre&#8208;prepared organic structure directing agents (OSDAs). The high silica ERS&#8208;7 zeolite (topology type ESV) can be crystallised using N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethylpyrrolidinium (dmpyrr) that is formed in situ via cyclisation of N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetramethyldiaminobutane (tmdab) when a cationic polymer is also present. The in situ generation of dmpyrr is demonstrated by solid&#8208;state 13C NMR spectroscopy and supported by both chemical analyses and comparative syntheses using pre&#8208;prepared dmpyrr. The cationic polymer inhibits the crystallisation of mordenite, which is otherwise observed to be the favoured product. The ERS&#8208;7 prepared via in situ dmpyrr synthesis (Si/Al = 14) is characterised by PXRD and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The CO2 adsorption seen for the H&#8208; and Na&#8208;forms indicate interactions with accessible Na+ cations. The synthetic studies indicate the potential for in situ generation of OSDAs to reduce the need for extended OSDA syntheses.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Removal Of Doxycycline Hydrochloride with Cerium&#8208;Aluminum Catalytic Anode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a cerium&#8208;aluminum bimetallic catalyst is fired using a one&#8208;step hydrothermal method, and a modified carbon fabric anode is created. Electrochemical degradation of doxycycline hydrochloride without additional oxidizing agents shows excellent results. Simultaneously, several cycle degradation studies yield outstanding results, and a degradation mechanism was presented by characterization and analysis.







Abstract
Doxycycline hydrochloride (DOX) is a widely used broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotic that is challenging to degrade, leading to a series of environmental issues. In this study, a bimetallic oxide catalyst was synthesized through hydrothermal calcination followed by annealing. The catalytic carbon cloth anode was fabricated by bonding materials directly onto carbon cloth. Various characterization methods were employed to analyze the surface morphology, composition, and electrochemical properties of the electrodes. The materials exhibited rich surface morphology and exceptional electrochemical surface area. The catalyst primarily consisted of CeO2 and CeAlO3, demonstrating a 93.85&#8201;% removal efficiency of DOX within 2&#8197;hours under optimized conditions. Even after seven consecutive degradation cycles, the DOX degradation rate remained at 82&#8201;%, confirming the remarkable stability of the electrodes. The product distribution generated during the degradation of DOX was identified using LC&#8211;MS analysis, and a potential electrochemical degradation mechanism was proposed. Our results indicate that the bimetallic hybrid coordination significantly enhances the catalytic activity and electrochemical stability of the materials. This work offers a novel approach for preparing modified carbon cloth anodes with high catalytic activity and durability, laying a crucial foundation for the efficient degradation of the antibiotic DOX.

         <title>The Synthesis of Hydroquinolines from Nitroaldehydes and Ketones by Hydrogenation Sequences and Condensations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report here a novel complex chemical reaction namely the synthesis of hydroquinolines starting from nitroaldehydes and ketones and hydrogen. The nitroaldehyde is selectively hydrogenated forming an aminoaldehyde, followed by a base&#8208;catalyzed condensation leading to a quinoline intermediate and selective quinoline hydrogenation.







Abstract
Catalytic reaction discovery or methodology development is preferably performed with homogeneous catalysts, but heterogeneous catalysts allow the design of complex multistep syntheses based on their reusability. We introduce here the catalytic synthesis of hydroquinolines starting from nitroaldehydes, ketones and hydrogen. The reaction is complex and proceeds via multiple selective hydrogenation and condensation steps. The nitroaldehyde is selectively hydrogenated forming an aminoaldehyde, followed by a base&#8208;catalyzed Friedl&#228;nder synthesis and selective quinoline hydrogenation. The starting materials are inexpensive, simple regarding their structure and diversely available, and the hydroquinoline motif is part of numerous biologically active compounds. A nanostructured earth&#8208;abundant metal catalyst mediates our reaction most efficiently.

Abstract
In this work, we present for the first time an innovative strategy to construct high&#8208;performance hybrid supercapacitors through the synergistic optimization of vanadium&#8208;doped self&#8208;supported three&#8208;dimensional Flower&#8208;like Fe&#8322;(MoO&#8324;)&#8323; anodes and SnO&#8322;/CNTs composite anodes. The V&#8208;doped Fe&#8322;(MoO&#8324;)&#8323; anode synthesized by a microwave&#8208;assisted hydrothermal method combines vanadium doping&#8208;induced oxygen vacancies, lattice distortion effects and self&#8208;supporting properties of the three&#8208;dimensional floral structure, which enhances the specific surface area of the material to 190.58&#8197;m2/g, and obtains a high specific capacitance of 2,157&#8197;F/g at a current density of 1&#8197;A/g, and undergoes a 15&#8197;A/g After 10,000 cycles at 15&#8197;A/g, the capacitance retention rate is still 98.2&#8201;%. To address the limitations of traditional anode materials, SnO&#8322;/CNTs composites significantly reduce the charge transfer resistance (5.61&#8197;&#937;) and enhance the multiplicity performance by combining the high theoretical capacity of SnO&#8322; with the three&#8208;dimensional conductive network of CNTs. Based on this, the V&#8722;Fe&#8322;(MoO&#8324;)&#8323;//SnO&#8322;/CNTs hybrid supercapacitor achieves a high energy density of 151&#8197;Wh/kg at 3&#8197;A/g, which is a 30&#8211;60&#8201;% enhancement over the conventional molybdate capacitor, and maintains 96.2&#8201;% capacitance stability after 10,000 cycles. This provides a new idea for the development of energy storage devices with high energy density and long cycle life.

         <title>Formation of TEMPO Adducts with Hydrogen Atom Transfer: An Alternative Pathway to Versatile Hydrofunctionalizations of Olefins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step cobalt&#8208;catalyzed method is developed for the hydrofunctionalization of olefins, involving TEMPO adduct formation followed by photocatalytic nucleophilic substitution. This approach enables the formation of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;F, and C&#8722;Cl bonds with high efficiency. The method demonstrates potential for PET applications with hydrofluorination and offers an alternative pathway to diastereoselective olefin hydration.







Abstract
A two&#8208;step process is developed to access a broad range of hydrofunctionalization of olefins, by combining a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed formation of TEMPO adduct from olefins and a photocatalytic nucleophilic addition to generate a new C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;F, and C&#8722;Cl bond. Nucleophilic fluorination can be achieved with a short reaction time, showing its potential in PET applications. Combining the two steps, net hydrofunctionalization of olefins with a broad range has been achieved.

Nucleophilic fluorination can be achieved with a short reaction time, showing its potential in PET applications. Combining the two steps, net hydrofunctionalization of olefins with a broad range has been achieved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Recognition and Chiral Discrimination from NMR and Multi&#8208;Scale Simulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the enantioselective discrimination of mandelic acid enantiomers using (R)&#8208;BINOL and (S)&#8208;BINOL through a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, molecular dynamics simulations, and quantum mechanical calculations. The findings provide a detailed understanding of the diffusion properties and binding interactions that drive chiral recognition at the molecular level.








Abstract
Chiral molecules are particularly interesting to the pharmaceutical and agrochemical sectors due to their chemical and physical properties. Separation and identification of enantiomers are critical for a broad range of compounds, and discriminating stereoisomers in solution remains a key analytical challenge. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) with Matrix&#8208;Assisted Diffusion&#8208;Ordered Spectroscopy (MAD), in the presence of chiral resolving agents, has emerged as a tool to explore these chiral mixtures. However, insight into the intermolecular interactions that lead to chiral recognition is still limited. Here, we combine experimental MAD studies with computational approaches to investigate the enantioselective discrimination of Mandelic Acid (MA) enantiomers using (R)&#8208;BINOL and (S)&#8208;BINOL. Molecular dynamics simulations explain the differences in diffusion coefficients for heterochiral complexes. Furthermore, quantum mechanical calculations confirmed enantioselective binding preferences due to differences in Gibbs free energies, highlighting the fundamental interactions and structural criteria that explain the NMR shielding and the diffusion trends. This integrated approach bridges experimental and theoretical studies, offering a comprehensive understanding of chiral recognition mechanisms and elucidating the observed heterochiral preference of BINOL for MA enantiomers. Our findings advance the field of chiral analysis and lay a foundation for future developments for identifying stereoisomers and recognition modes underlying enantioselective binding.

         <title>Slight&#8208;Crosslinking: Opening a New Journey for the Intrinsic Elastification of Ferroelectric Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the field of ferroelectric polymers, slight&#8208;crosslinking techniques have emerged as a crucial innovation, opening new avenues for the advancement of elastic electronics. This paper provides an in&#8208;depth exploration of diverse crosslinking methodologies, such as diamine crosslinking, carbene reaction, thiol&#8208;ene click reaction, and peroxide crosslinking. It reviews the key achievements in this field and highlights potential future research directions for further development.








Abstract
Elastic electronic materials are essential components in the next generation of wearable devices and soft robots. However, the development of elastic ferroelectric materials has lagged behind that of conductive and semiconductive materials. The successful realization of intrinsically elastic ferroelectrics through slight&#8208;crosslinking has opened a new path for making ferroelectric materials elastic. Given the critical need for materials that combine excellent elasticity with robust ferroelectric properties in the field of elastic electronics, we explore various crosslinking techniques and their performance characteristics. We believe that this cutting&#8208;edge research direction holds substantial value for both fundamental studies and practical applications.

Novel BINOL&#8208; and H8&#8208;BINOL&#8208;tethered boramidines are reported, leveraging the chiral perturbation strategy for CPL material design. These enantiopure compounds, prepared in a concise three&#8208;step synthesis, exhibit high fluorescence quantum yields &#981; (up to 95% in N&#8322;&#8208;saturated solutions) and luminescence dissymmetry factors |glum| &#8764; 10&#8722;3.

         <title>Low&#8208;Power Piezoelectric Energy from Chiral Supramolecular Polymer of a Donor&#8208;Acceptor&#8208;Donor Conjugated &#960;&#8208;System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Soft piezoelectric systems have high demands in flexible, shape conformable and biocompatible low&#8208;power electronics. This paper explores chiral supramolecular polymerization of an ambipolar donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (DAD)&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;system showing emerging piezoelectric properties for harvesting micro energies. The DAD molecule is designed with two conjugated thiophene donors with a central naphthalene&#8208;diimide (NDI) acceptor chromophore &#160;to facilitate intra&#8208;molecular charge&#8208;transfer, evident from a prominent absorption band in the visible region. This chromophore is further appended with two chiral benzamide&#8208;wedges for homochiral supramolecular polymerization. The ambipolar character of the chiral DAD chromophore is manifest from the cyclic voltammogram. Extended H&#8208;bonding among the amide groups leads to homochiral supramolecular polymerization in methyl&#8208;cyclohexane (MCH), which is retained in the solid film. The impeccable piezoelectricity in poled DAD film revealed a d33 ~ 7 pm/V as measured by the piezoforce microscopy. Piezo DAD devices under optimised periodic external impact force, frequencies and supplied electric field generate a viable output voltage and current density of 1.3 V, 0.8 &#181;A/cm2 and Poutput ~ 1.6 &#181;W/cm2, respectively. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, stacked and poled supramolecular &#960;&#8208;conjugated DAD devices are shown to viably illuminate a light emitting diode through charging a series of micro capacitors, indicating the potential utility for low power technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Raman Optical Activity Enhanced via Supramolecular Aggregation and Other Intermolecular Interactions &#8211; a Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this review, we show that Raman optical activity (ROA) combined with electronic circular dichroism (ECD) are effective tools for detecting supramolecular chirality and related processes such as chiral signal amplification and chirality transfer (also called induction) between chiral and achiral solutes. Research on spontaneous self&#8208;organization has led to significant discoveries in vibrational optical activity (VOA) over the past decade. As a leading topic, we discuss different aggregation pathways of carotenoids, which contributed to the definition of new phenomena in the field of ROA, i.e. aggregation&#8208;induced resonance Raman optical activity (AIRROA), and the first chirality induction observed in nature. We present the chirality of carotenoids as i) amplification via supramolecular assembly, ii) induction by a small number of chiral monomers, and iii) transfer from the local environment. We also report here other complex systems that are relevant to the VOA community in the context of chiroptical analysis. These include ROA signal enhancement, e.g. recorded for amyloid fibrils or achiral linker aggregates attached to silver colloid (plasmonic effects). Finally, we highlight the challenges faced by ROA studies of supramolecular aggregates of strongly absorbing compounds, where chirality transfer may be misinterpreted as artifacts due to the ECD&#8208;Raman effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Research Progress Of Polyacrylate Binders For Silicon&#8208;based Anodes In Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silicon (Si) has emerged as a preeminent candidate for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) anodes, primarily attributed to its exceptionally high specific capacity. Nevertheless, the substantial volumetric expansion accompanying lithium alloying reactions has long posed a critical challenge to the commercial viability of silicon&#8208;based anodes. Binders as connectors between the active Si particles, conductive agents, and current collectors, playing a crucial role in stabilizing the structure of silicon anodes in LIBs. Polyacrylic acid (PAA) water&#8208;based binders contain abundant carboxyl groups (&#8208;COOH) that can enhance adhesive strength. However, simple linear PAA does not adequately accommodate the significant volume expansion of silicon anodes. To address this issue, various structural optimization strategies have been applied to modify PAA binders. In this context, a comprehensive review is conducted on the recently developed PAA&#8208;based binders, which cover linear, branched, and three&#8208;dimensional network configurations. A meticulous comparison is carried out regarding their initial coulombic efficiency, areal capacity, and material costs. Moreover, in&#8208;depth insights are offered to elucidate the mechanisms by which these structural modifications augment the properties of the binders and the performance of the cells. Ultimately, the prospective directions for the evolution of PAA&#8208;based binders designed for Si&#8208;based anodes in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LIBs are deliberated.</dc:description>

Binders as connectors between the active Si particles, conductive agents, and current collectors, playing a crucial role in stabilizing the structure of silicon anodes in LIBs. Polyacrylic acid (PAA) water-based binders contain abundant carboxyl groups (-COOH) that can enhance adhesive strength.

In this context, a comprehensive review is conducted on the recently developed PAA-based binders, which cover linear, branched, and three-dimensional network configurations.

Moreover, in-depth insights are offered to elucidate the mechanisms by which these structural modifications augment the properties of the binders and the performance of the cells.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Mediated Polymers: Strengthening, Toughening, and Stabilizing Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditionally, the design and synthesis of polymers have centered on engineering their covalent chain or network structures. However, noncovalent interactions between polymer chains can influence the properties of polymers to a degree comparable to or even greater than their covalent structures. Therefore, shifting the focus of polymer design from covalent structure engineering to noncovalent interaction modulation represents a new paradigm for polymer innovation. This Concept article summarizes our recent advances in H&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated polymers (HBMPs), fabricated by meticulously tuning the interchain/intersegment H&#8208;bonding interactions, in conjunction with rational design of the covalent polymer chain or network structures. We demonstrate that H&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated assembly provides an effective strategy to fabricate new polymers with unprecedented properties and sustainability, using commodity polymers as building blocks. Importantly, the synergy of multivalence cooperativity and dynamic nature of the H&#8208;bonding interactions in HBMPs can reconcile the intrinsic trade&#8208;off between mechanical strength and toughness of polymers, achieving both superhigh strength and superhigh toughness. Moreover, optimizing multivalence cooperativity can make the H&#8208;bonded crosslinks exhibit a covalent crosslinking effect, offering thermoset&#8208;like stability while preserving thermoplastic&#8208;like recyclability. The concept of HBMPs can be extended to noncovalent&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated systems, opening new avenues for polymer innovation and expanding the potential for creating functional and sustainable materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Reversible Nitroamino&#8208;Based Switch Modulates Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Networks in Energetic Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regulation of hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks in molecular switches is critical for adaptive materials. However, most of the reported molecular switches do not are not capable of modulating hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks in energetic materials, limiting their use in high&#8208;demand applications such as energetic systems. In this work, the first high&#8208;energy nitroamino&#8208;based molecular switch is reported. It can control the complex hydrogen bonding systems of energetic materials by reversible cycling for property modulation. Through alkali&#8208;acid stimulation, the nitroamino&#8208;based switch undergoes dynamic transitions, which reconfigure H&#8208;bond networks and separate twin crystals (in X&#8208;ray verification). Supported by crystallography and theorical modeling (e.g., the density of states), this switching mechanism modulates molecular planarity (&#916;&#952;&gt;60&#176;) and optimizes the energy&#8208;stability balance, obtaining a compound 6&#8208;&#946; with comprehensive properties comparable to classical explosives (e.g., RDX and HMX). By linking hydrogen&#8208;bonding engineering and energetic materials science through the nitroamino&#8208;based molecular switch, it facilitates superior energetic compounds that can be applied to defense equipments. In addition, our work establishes the nitroamino&#8208;based switch as a generalized tool for molecular engineering, bridging dynamic hydrogen&#8208;bonding control and self&#8208;assembly materials design.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Emissive Flexible Organic Crystals with Broad Piezochromism and  Optical Waveguide s</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integration of mechanical flexibility with stimuli&#8208;responsive optical properties in organic single crystals (OSCs) remains a formidable challenge due to the intrinsic rigidity of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. Herein, we report a rationally designed OSC, FBCF, that synergistically combines elastic deformability, broad piezochromism and low&#8208;loss optical waveguiding via a planar benzothiadiazole (BTA) core and fluoroarene termini. The molecular architecture enforces face&#8208;to&#8208;face slip&#8208;stacking via multiple noncovalent interactions (N&#183;&#183;&#183;H, &#960;&#8208;&#960;, and C&#8208;F&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;), yielding centimeter&#8208;scale crystals with exceptional elastic bending and full recovery. These crystals exhibit a high photoluminescence (PL) efficiency (PLQY = 75.8%) and serve as low&#8208;loss optical waveguides, maintaining performance even when bent (optical loss coefficients: 0.286&#8211;0.529 dB mm&#8208;1). Crucially, FBCF exhibits broad pressure&#8208;responsive spectral shifts (&#916;&#955; = 171 nm), achieving a piezochromic sensitivity of 16.7 nmGPa&#8208;1, exceeding that of most organic systems. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses reveal hierarchical packing: rigid lamellar layers (stabilized by strong &#960;&#8208;&#960;/dipole interactions, &#8209;118.56 to &#8209;58.45 kcal/mol) interconnected via weaker interlayer C&#8208;F&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; bonds (&#8722;18.8 kcal/mol). This architecture enables elastic deformation through interlayer slippage while preserving intralayer order.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocleavage and Photophysical Properties of Amine Releasing BODIPY Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper introduces the synthesis, structural studies, photophysical properties, and photocleavage studies of three novel green light cleavable boron dipyrromethene&#160;(BODIPY) derivatives with varying sizes of aromatic terminal groups. All BODIPY derivatives have similar spectroscopical properties. Photocleavage studies in different conditions revealed that amine release depends on the presence of oxygen, concentration, and the nature of the amine to be released.








Abstract
To date, there is still a lack of suitable methods for chemical modification of graphene surfaces in situ. Photocleavable compounds have great potential for in situ modification of chemical species with visible light, leaving desired chemical functionalities on the surface. Green light&#8208;sensitive boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) derivatives can release diverse cargos, including biologically important amines. In this study, green light&#8208;sensitive photocleavable BODIPY derivatives with different aromatic anchors for surface binding were designed and synthesized with the ultimate goal of selective graphene surface patterning. The effects of different aromatic anchor groups on photocleaving capability, their structural and photophysical properties and photocleavage in different conditions were studied. Photocleavage was significantly faster, and more controllable photoreaction was achieved in inert conditions than in the presence of oxygen (ambient air). In addition, pyrene as an anchor lowered fluorescence quantum yield and intensities of absorption and emission maxima of the entire BODIPY derivative, making it a poorer fluorophore than the derivatives with the naphthalene and phenyl anchors.

         <title>The Use of Deep Eutectic Solvents for the Synthesis of Iron Oxides Nanoparticles: A Driving Force for Materials Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) structurally directed the growth of technologically relevant Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (IONs) towards magnetic (magnetite) or non&#8208;magnetic (hematite) crystal structures, according to their intrinsic properties.








Abstract
In this study, we explored the use of Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) as a green and sustainable alternative for the synthesis of Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (IONs). Six different binary mixtures of Hydrogen Bond Acceptors (HBAs) and Donors (HBDs) were prepared and thoroughly characterized to investigate how their components and physicochemical properties influence the structure, morphology, and magnetic properties of the resulting IONs. In addition, the role of DESs was assessed using ATR&#8208;MIR spectroscopy, providing insights into HBA&#8208;HBD interactions with iron precursors. The study highlights the critical role of DES constituents, particularly the interactions between HBAs and HBDs, in directing nanoparticle size, structure, and morphology. Indeed, our results demonstrate that the choice of DES significantly impacts the crystalline phase of iron oxide nanoparticles, yielding either magnetite (Fe&#8323;O&#8324;) or hematite (&#945;&#8208;Fe&#8322;O&#8323;). These findings established a robust framework for leveraging DES in nanomaterial synthesis, paving the way for more environmentally friendly approaches in diverse industrial and scientific applications.

Six different binary mixtures of Hydrogen Bond Acceptors (HBAs) and Donors (HBDs) were prepared and thoroughly characterized to investigate how their components and physicochemical properties influence the structure, morphology, and magnetic properties of the resulting IONs. In addition, the role of DESs was assessed using ATR-MIR spectroscopy, providing insights into HBA-HBD interactions with iron precursors. The study highlights the critical role of DES constituents, particularly the interactions between HBAs and HBDs, in directing nanoparticle size, structure, and morphology. Indeed, our results demonstrate that the choice of DES significantly impacts the crystalline phase of iron oxide nanoparticles, yielding either magnetite (Fe&#8323;O&#8324;) or hematite (&#945;-Fe&#8322;O&#8323;). These findings established a robust framework for leveraging DES in nanomaterial synthesis, paving the way for more environmentally friendly approaches in diverse industrial and scientific applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The AgNO&#8323; and FeCl&#8323; relay&#8208;catalyzed halochalcogenation and cyclization reaction of terminal aryl alkynols provides a step&#8208;efficient regio&#8208; and chemoselective synthetic approach to produce halogenated selenonaphthalene derivatives in good yields.








Abstract
Herein, we report an AgNO3 and FeCl3 relay&#8208;catalyzed halogenation and electrophilic selenium cyclization reaction. This reaction is based on the trifunctionalization of terminal alkynols using NBS and diorganyl diselenides, providing a step&#8208;efficient synthetic approach to produce halogenated selenonaphthalene derivatives in good yields. Furthermore, the halochalcogenation and cyclization reaction offers an efficient protocol for constructing molecules with two independent reactive centers.

         <title>The Redox Cycle of Viologen&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymers for High&#8208;Performance Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by natural photosynthesis, the redox&#8208;active moiety of MV2+ was introduced into POPs. As a strong electron acceptor, MV2+ can rapidly capture electrons, promoting the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency for H2O2 production. TPE&#8208;MV demonstrated excellent performance in photocatalytic water splitting, highlighting the crucial role of MV2+ in the photocatalytic process.








Abstract
Harnessing solar energy to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an important strategy to address the current energy shortage. Among various materials, porous organic polymers (POPs) stand out as promising candidates for photocatalytic H2O2 generation due to their versatile structures and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation; however, their efficiency in H2O2 synthesis is often constrained by poor charge separation and high reaction energy barriers. To address these challenges, we drew inspiration from the redox reactions of coenzyme NADPH in natural photosynthesis, the redox&#8208;active methyl viologen (MV2+) moiety was rationally incorporated into two polymer frameworks (TPE&#8208;MV and TPB&#8208;MV) as pivotal active sites for photocatalytic oxygen (O2) reduction to H2O2 via the reversible redox cycle of MV2+ and zerovalent methyl viologen (MV0). Through this redox cycle, MV2&#8314; accepts two photogenerated electrons, reducing it to MV&#8304;. MV&#8304; sequentially reduces O&#8322; to H&#8322;O&#8322; while regenerating MV2&#8314;. Mechanistic studies show that this approach effectively suppresses charge recombination and lowers the reaction energy barriers. Consequently, the photocatalytic H&#8322;O&#8322; generation rates of TPE&#8208;MV and TPB&#8208;MV reached 6068 and 2015&#160;&#181;mol g&#8315;&#185; h&#8315;&#185;, respectively. This work offers a new strategy for designing efficient photocatalysts by incorporating biomimetic redox&#8208;active moieties to enhance solar energy utilization for H2O2 production.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functioning Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Methotrexate&#8208;Loaded Gadolinium MOFs as Drug Carriers and Radiosensitizers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores gadolinium metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Gd&#8208;MOFs) as dual&#8208;functional platforms for anticancer drug delivery and radiosensitization. Synthesized using terephthalic acid and gadolinium (III) chloride hexahydrate, Gd&#8208;MOFs were loaded with methotrexate (MTX) and characterized via fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD). In vitro studies on A549 and BEAS&#8208;2B cells under radiotherapy demonstrated enhanced cytotoxicity in cancer cells, highlighting their potential for selective therapy. The findings support Gd&#8208;MOFs as promising candidates for combinatory cancer treatments, improving therapeutic efficacy. The graphical summary illustrates their role in drug delivery, MRI imaging, and radiosensitization. 








Abstract
Cancer remains a critical global health challenge, necessitating advanced drug delivery systems through innovations in materials science and nanotechnology. This study evaluates gadolinium metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Gd&#8208;MOFs) as potential drug delivery systems for anticancer therapy, particularly when combined with radiotherapy. Gd&#8208;MOFs were synthesized using terephthalic acid and gadolinium (III) chloride hexahydrate and then loaded with methotrexate (MTX). Characterization via fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed their correct structure and stability. Effective MTX loading and controlled release were demonstrated. Anticancer effects were assessed on human healthy bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS&#8208;2B) and human lung cancer cells (A549) using the 3&#8208;(4,5&#8208;dimethylthiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay under in vitro radiation therapy. MTX/Gd&#8208;MOF combined with radiotherapy showed a greater reduction in cancer cell viability (41.89%&#160;&#177;&#160;2.75 for A549) compared to healthy cells (56.80%&#160;&#177;&#160;1.97 for BEAS&#8208;2B), indicating selective cytotoxicity. These findings highlight the potential of Gd&#8208;MOFs not only as drug delivery vehicles but also as radiosensitizers, enhancing radiotherapy efficacy and offering promising evidence for their use in combinatory cancer therapies to improve treatment outcomes.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding&#8211;Induced Multicolor and Thermochromic Emissions of Triphenylamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two triphenylamine derivatives exhibited distinct fluorescence behaviors under stimuli such as mechanical grinding, heat, and solvents. The intramolecular hydrogen bonds, as well as hydrogen bonds with solvents, were responsible for their stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescence properties. Regulating the rigidity through hydrogen bonding offers a feasible strategy for designing stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.








Abstract
The fluorescence tuning of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials is crucial but challenging. The deep understanding of thermal induced fluorescence change, however, has rarely been conducted. Herein, the thermochromic emission of a triphenylamine (TPA) derivative (1), with one acetyl and two 1&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;methylethyl units on each o&#8208;phenyl group around the nitrogen atom, has been investigated. Upon heating, the bright blue&#8208;emitting solid 1 turns to a strong green&#8208;emitting liquid. Moreover, 1 is green emissive in ethanol but blue emissive with high absolute quantum yields in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Another TPA derivative (2) is green emitting. X&#8208;ray crystallography studies reveal that the strong solid&#8208;state fluorescence arises from a rigid pyramidal structure around central nitrogen of 1, due to the OH&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;OH, OH&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O&#160;=&#160;C hydrogen bonding interactions. Comparatively, 2 has a planar configuration of three C&#9472;N bonds around central nitrogen atom. This work will provide a new route for constructing multiemission materials using unimolecular platforms.

         <title>Thermodynamic Water Activity Explains the Unusual Electrochemical Stability of Aqueous Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study examines the activity of water in pure solvents and deep eutectic solvents (DESs), its deviation from classical thermodynamic models like Raoult's law, and its impact on electrochemical stability of DESs.








Abstract
The presence of water in nonaqueous deep eutectic solvent (DES) electrolytes has been debated in recent years, with efforts ranging from its complete removal to willful addition. It was shown that controlled amounts of water can be beneficial, as it not only enhances the physicochemical properties of these electrolytes but also has no significant detrimental effects on their electrochemical stability. Despite these advantages, there is still limited understanding of how water interacts with DES systems at the molecular level. This study examines the water activity in ethylene glycol and glycerol, as well as their binary mixtures with choline chloride to form the DESs ethaline and glyceline, respectively. In this work, we show that the high electrochemical stability of glyceline is related to its lower water activity compared to ethaline and can be attributed to the robust H&#8208;bonding network formed by the three hydroxyl groups of glycerol. Its 3D H&#8208;bond network effectively integrates water molecules within its solvent structure, reducing degradation and maintaining stability at higher water contents. The deviations from the ideal Raoult's law behavior are reflected in the water activity and activity coefficients, which highlight the intricate H&#8208;bond interactions within DES&#8208;water mixtures. Water acts like a lubricant within the more viscous DES mixtures without being detrimental to their electrochemical performance. The presented results emphasize the necessity of customizing DES&#8208;water compositions to enhance their performance as electrolytes, especially in flow battery applications where electrochemical stability, ionic conductivity, and fluidity are of utmost importance.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transmetalation from boron onto beryllium was observed. This reaction is triggered through steric overcrowding of the beryllium atom or reducing the ligand beryllium bond strength through oxidation of the ligating phosphorus atoms.








Abstract
Investigation of tris(di&#8208;iso&#8208;propylphosphanylmethyl)phenylborate ([TP(iPr)]&#8722;) organo&#8208;beryllium complexes [TP(iPr)]BeR with R&#160;=&#160;Ph, nBu, Cp, Cp* revealed transmetalation of [CH2P(iPr)2]&#8722; groups from boron onto beryllium. This reaction is caused by partial dissociation of the scorpionate, which can be triggered through steric overcrowding of the beryllium atom or reducing the ligand beryllium bond strength through oxidation of the phosphorus atoms with selenium.

         <title>Catalytic Production of Aromatic Amines from Nitroaromatics&#8212;Addressing a Critical Challenge in Environmental Remediation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reviews the continuous&#8208;flow reduction of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) into valuable aromatic amines, addressing environmental and industrial challenges. Key topics include reactor designs such as microreactors and packed&#8208;bed systems, advanced catalysts like bimetallic nanoparticles, and emerging trends like hybrid photocatalysis. The work emphasizes transforming toxic NAC waste into fine chemical products, aligning with Circular Economy principles.








Abstract
The present work reviews the continuous&#8208;flow hydrogenation of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) to aromatic amines, highlighting its significance in sustainable chemical manufacturing. These processes offer enhanced efficiency, scalability, and safety compared to traditional batch methods, addressing the environmental concerns associated with NACs contamination. In this context, the flow&#8208;mode processes of NACs hydrogenation may be considered as tools for catalytically driven extraction of fine chemical products. Within this review, key aspects, including an overview of flow reactor designs&#8212;such as packed&#8208;bed and microreactors&#8212;optimizing heat and mass transfer are discussed. Additionally, various catalytic materials, including bimetallic nanoparticles and metal&#8208;organic frameworks, are explored for their improved stability and selectivity in NACs reduction. The kinetics of these reactions aids in understanding the factors affecting reaction, and mass transfer rates. Despite the advantages, challenges remain, including catalyst deactivation and reactor design complexities, particularly during scale&#8208;up for industrial applications. Future trends indicate a shift toward hybrid systems integrating photocatalysis and biocatalysis, enhancing the versatility of continuous&#8208;flow processes. Ultimately, the adoption of these technologies is anticipated to play a crucial role in the circular economy by converting hazardous waste into valuable products, thereby fostering innovation and environmental preservation in the chemical industry.

         <title>Frosted DNA: &#946;&#8208;Galactosidase Control of Oligonucleotide Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#946;&#8208;Galactosidase is expressed at low level in many native cells and strongly upregulated in senescent cells. In the present study, we use &#946;&#8208;galactosidase activity as internal trigger to control the hybridization of oligonucleotides&#8211;eventually selective in senescent cells.








ABSTRACT
We introduce a novel approach for the control of oligonucleotides through enzymatic activation with &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (&#946;&#8208;gal). We use the well&#8208;known enzymatic capability of &#946;&#8208;gal to hydrolyze the &#946;&#8208;galactosidic bond combined with a self&#8208;immolative linker and present three ways of steric or topological blocking of a DNA oligonucleotide. Through a series of in vitro experiments with &#946;&#8208;gal variants (recombinant or from human cell lysates), we systematically investigate stability, transitory perturbation, and enzymatic activation. Our approach holds significant promise for applications related to senescence&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;gal activity, including targeted modulation of gene expression and programmable molecular interventions. The combination of enzymatic activation applied to oligonucleotides represents a significant advance for targeted release in affected cells without the need for external triggering.

         <title>Activation and Fixation of Atmospheric CO2 through a 1,2,3&#8208;Triazole&#8208;Based Mesoionic Carbene&#8211;Borane Adduct</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triazole&#8208;based mesoionic carbene (MIC)&#8211;borane compound captures atmospheric CO2 and converts it into formate. The rate and product formation of CO2 reduction is seen to be strongly dependent on the CO2 source with both formate and bicarbonate being produced with the same MIC&#8211;borane compound. A battery of spectroscopic methods was used to investigate the intermediates and understand the underlying mechanism.








Abstract
Capturing atmospheric CO2 and converting it to valuable chemicals are important goals in contemporary science. We present here a simple, transition metal&#8208;free triazolylidene&#8211;borane adduct that can capture atmospheric CO2 and convert it to formate. Several key intermediates were isolated and characterized by a combination of multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. A first closed cycle for the conversion of CO2 to formic acid by using the aforementioned triazolylidene&#8211;borane compound is presented as well.

The rate and product formation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction is seen to be strongly dependent on the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; source with both formate and bicarbonate being produced with the same MIC&#8211;borane compound. A battery of spectroscopic methods was used to investigate the intermediates and understand the underlying mechanism.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capturing atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and converting it to valuable chemicals are important goals in contemporary science. We present here a simple, transition metal-free triazolylidene&#8211;borane adduct that can capture atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and convert it to formate. Several key intermediates were isolated and characterized by a combination of multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy and single crystal X-ray diffraction. A first closed cycle for the conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to formic acid by using the aforementioned triazolylidene&#8211;borane compound is presented as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Performances of Carbon&#8208;Based Tetrel Bond Catalysis by Density Functional Theory and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work investigates carbon&#8208;based tetrel bond catalysis via density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML). The bowl&#8208;like &#963;&#8208;hole in 1,1&#8208;dicyano&#8208;3,3&#8208;dicarbonylcyclopropane (DCDC) unit acts as the primary catalytic active site in catalyzing Micheal addition reaction, surpassing 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetracyanocyclopropane (TCCP) unit in cyclopropane derivatives. Electron&#8208;withdrawing group modifications significantly enhance catalytic efficacy, with stronger groups yielding superior performance. ML models are employed to rapidly predict catalyst performance, offering a streamlined strategy for designing efficient tetrel bond catalysts.








Abstract
The non&#8208;covalent interaction catalysis has been widely developed and applied in organocatalysis for its green and economical characteristics. In recent years, the carbon&#8208;based tetrel bonds have been successfully applied in organocatalysis. In this work, the structure&#8208;property relationship of carbon&#8208;based tetrel bond catalysts is established by utilizing density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML). Taking the Michael addition reaction as an example, the reaction mechanism and new insight into the catalytic active site are introduced based on the DFT&#8208;calculated results. The bowl&#8208;like 1,1&#8208;dicyano&#8208;3,3&#8208;dicarbonylcyclopropane (DCDC) unit based &#963;&#8208;hole is much more important than the 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetracyanocyclopropane (TCCP) unit in tetrel bond catalysts. Introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups into catalysts significantly enhances the catalytic activity and provides a new strategy for designing efficient catalysts. Furthermore, the construction and evaluation of ML models demonstrate their potential in predicting the catalyst performance, offering a new protocol for fast prediction of the catalytic performance of tetrel bond catalysts.

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Activity of Bimetallic CoNi&#8208;MOF for OER and HER Through a Synergistic Bimetallic Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CoNi&#8208;bimetallic MOF was synthesized alongside its monometallic counterparts, Co(II)&#8208;MOF and Ni(II)&#8208;MOF, using 3&#8208;pyridyl acrylic acid as the ligand. The bimetallic MOF exhibited superior electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Additionally, it demonstrated excellent stability over 1000 cycles, attributed to the synergistic effect of Co2+ and Ni2+ ions and the hydrogen bonding within the structure.








Abstract
Due to the decreasing availability, reduced stability, and high cost of noble metal&#8208;based catalysts, the search for stable, efficient, and inexpensive electrocatalysts is of significant importance. In this study, three new isostructural Co(II), Ni(II), and CoNi metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) based on bis&#8208;coordinating ligand 3&#8208;pyridyl acrylic acid are explored as efficient electrocatalysts. The structure of CoNi&#8208;MOF was further confirmed by various experimental techniques. The electrocatalytic activities toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) revealed that the bimetallic CoNi&#8208;MOF demonstrated significantly greater activity towards OER and HER compared to its monometallic counterparts, Co&#8208;MOF and Ni&#8208;MOF. CoNi&#8208;MOF requires 350 mV and 150 mV overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 for OER and HER, respectively. Moreover, they exhibited excellent stability for 6 hours and 1000 OER cycles, demonstrating its superiority in these reactions. The significant enhancement in the performance of CoNi&#8208;MOF is attributed to the bimetallic synergistic effects between the redox&#8208;active metal centers Co2+ and Ni2+, which increase the activity of the catalyst's surface, resulting in enhanced current density and reduced overpotential. The hydrogen bond between coordinated water molecules and un&#8208;coordinated carboxylate is essential for the electrochemical stability of the materials.

         <title>Synthesis of Heteroleptic Amidinato Calcium Halides via the In&#8208;Situ Grignard Addition Method (iGAM) Complementing the Metalation of Amidines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in&#8208;situ generation of Grignard&#8208;type organocalcium reagents via the reduction of alkyl and aryl halides in THF and their immediate use for subsequent addition onto carbodiimides allows the synthesis of hitherto unknown amidinates of calcium.








Abstract
The in&#8208;situ Grignard addition method adds intermediately prepared organo alkaline&#8208;earth metal halides onto a suitable substrate. Here, freshly rasped calcium and the carbodiimide R&#8242;&#9472;N&#9552;C&#9552;N&#9472;R&#8242; (R&#8242; = SiMe3, iPr) are suspended in THF at room temperature and then an organyl halide R&#9472;X (X = Br, I) is added. Within several hours, intermediately formed R&#9472;Ca&#9472;X adds onto the carbodiimide yielding the corresponding thf adducts of the amidinato calcium halide {(R&#8242;N)2C&#9472;R}CaX. Suitable organyl halides besides aryl iodide are methyl and ethyl halide whereas bulkier isopropyl and tert&#8208;butyl iodides give very low yields.

         <title>A Deep Eutectic Solvent Electrolyte Enables Planar Cu Deposition and High&#8208;Temperature Cu&#8211;MnO2 Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deep eutectic solvent (DES) electrolyte composed of choline chloride and urea exhibits superior high&#8208;temperature resistance compared with the aqueous electrolyte. A high&#8208;temperature Cu&#8211;MnO2 full cell with the DES electrolyte is able to maintain a capacity of 174.8 mAh g&#8722;1 after 300 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1, demonstrating great potential for application under harsh conditions. 








Abstract
Cu anodes exhibit a higher theoretical specific capacity (843 mAh g&#8722;1 or 7558 mAh cm&#8722;3) than Zn anodes (820 mAh g&#8722;1 or 5855 mAh cm&#8722;3), and have garnered widespread attention. However, aqueous Cu&#8208;ion batteries suffer from severe Cu dendrite growth, limited cycle life, and poor high&#8208;temperature performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep eutectic solvent (DES) electrolyte is proposed to address these issues. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the DES electrolyte coordinates with Cu2+, thereby modulating the Cu deposition behavior. Consequently, planar deposition and extended cycle life (6000&#160;h versus 730&#160;h) are achieved. Furthermore, the DES electrolyte exhibits the promising application potential under harsh conditions. A high&#8208;temperature Cu&#9472;MnO2 full cell retains a capacity of 174.8 mAh g&#8722;1 after 300 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1 under 50 &#176;C.

Abstract
Glycans are biologically important molecules that are difficult to synthesize and analyze due to their structural diversity and conformational flexibility. Stereoselective glycosylation reactions are key to achieving high&#8208;yielding glycan syntheses. The stereochemical outcome of glycosylations is significantly influenced by factors such as the choice of activator and leaving group systems, solvent type, temperature, concentration, and stoichiometry. We introduce a flow chemistry approach to efficiently screen glycosylation conditions, using minimal material and time to enable a rapid design&#8208;make&#8208;test&#8208;analyze cycle with precise parameter control for reaction optimization. Ion mobility spectrometry provides rapid separation and analysis of crude glycosylation reaction mixtures that requires less method development than liquid chromatography thus making it a valuable tool for optimizing glycosylation reactions.

         <title>Ene&#8208;Reductases&#8208;Catalyzed Non&#8208;Natural Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flavin&#8208;dependent ene&#8208;reductases catalyze a variety of non&#8208;natural reactions, operating in both hydride&#8208;transfer dependent and independent modes, beyond their native asymmetric reduction of C&#9552;C bonds. These reactions are primarily governed by the tunable redox states of the FMN cofactor and the synergistic interactions between conserved residues within the enzyme's active site.








Abstract
Flavin&#8208;dependent ene&#8208;reductases (EREDs), members of the Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) superfamily, are highly efficient biocatalysts primarily known for catalyzing the asymmetric reduction of activated alkenes. Beyond this native function, the chemical versatility of the flavin cofactor and the sophisticated architecture of their protein structures enable EREDs to exhibit catalytic multifunctionality. The catalytic promiscuity not only highlights the adaptability of these enzymes but also expands their potential to broaden the scope of enzyme&#8208;catalyzed reactions in organic synthesis. Given the inherent challenges associated with discovering novel enzyme activities, such catalytic promiscuity of EREDs offers a promising pathway for expanding their applications. This mini&#8208;review provides a comprehensive overview of the catalytic multifunctionality of flavin&#8208;dependent EREDs, with a particular focus on their &#8220;non&#8208;natural&#8221; functionalities in organic synthesis. This review is primarily divided into two main sections: hydride&#8208;dependent reactions and hydride&#8208;independent reactions. By highlighting these unconventional biocatalytic pathways, we aim to inspire further exploration into the untapped potential of EREDs and their role in advancing synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Mechanically Robust and Recyclable Polyurea Networks Enabled by Dynamic Caprolactam&#8211;Urea Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new dynamic covalent bond&#8212;a caprolactam&#8211;urea bond&#8212;capable of undergoing catalyst&#8208;free dynamic exchange and cleavage reactions was reported. Based on this dynamic caprolactam&#8211;urea chemistry, the resulting cross&#8208;linked poly(caprolactam&#8211;ureas) networks exhibit robust mechanical strength, remarkable solvent resistance, and hydrolytic stability, while demonstrating excellent dual circularity, including mechanical and chemical recyclability.








Abstract
The integration of dynamic covalent bonds into polymer design offers transformative potential for sustainable materials.&#160;&#160;Herein, we report a catalyst&#8208;free dynamic caprolactam&#8211;urea (CAU) bond that enables the construction of poly(caprolactam&#8211;ureas) (PCAU) networks with dual mechanical and chemical recyclability. The resulting PCAU networks exhibit remarkable mechanical robustness, solvent resistance, and hydrolytic stability. Owing to the rapid dynamic exchange of CAU bonds, PCAU networks are successfully mechanically recycled via hot&#8208;pressing over multiple cycles with &gt;92% mechanical property retention. Furthermore, chemical recycling is achieved through selective depolymerization into caprolactam monomers under mild catalyst&#8208;free conditions, which are directly repolymerized into new generations of PCAU networks. This work establishes CAU chemistry as a versatile platform for designing high&#8208;performance dynamic polymers with applications in circular manufacturing.

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Membrane Spanning Tetraether Lipid brGDGT Ia and Elucidation of Its Stereochemical Configuration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGT's) are membrane&#8208;spanning lipids produced by Acidobacteria, and used extensively in geochemistry as proxies. The first total synthesis of brGDGT Ia has been achieved, elucidating the relative stereochemical configuration of the methyl branches in the chain as syn.








Abstract
Glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) are a group of membrane spanning lipids produced by both Archaea and Bacteria. Branched GDGTs (brGDGTs) are a class of these tetraether lipids known to be produced by certain bacteria and are commonly found in terrestrial environments. Due to their environmental ubiquity, high preservation potential, and role in membrane adaptation, brGDGTs form the basis of many widely employed paleoenvironmental proxies. The tetramethylated brGDGT Ia is the most commonly reported branched tetraether in cultured Acidobacteria and is a key component of brGDGT&#8208;based temperature indices. Herein, we report the first total synthesis of brGDGT Ia, thereby elucidating the relative configuration of the methyl branches as syn. We further demonstrate that VCD spectroscopy is a suitable tool to determine the absolute configuration of these cryptochiral compounds, a method waiting to be applied to the natural lipid, but currently hampered by its limited availability.

         <title>Method and Mechanistic Insights to 1,2&#8208;Aminochlorinate Alkenes using Blue&#8208;Light Activated Dichlorocarbamates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Blue light activation of N,N&#8208;dichlorocarbamates facilitates a direct 1,2&#8208;aminochlorination of unactivated olefins to yield 1,2&#8208;aminochlorinated compounds under ambient conditions. Mechanistic studies suggest that N,N&#8208;dichlorocarbamates undergo a photochemical excitation to yield a neutral N&#8208;centered radical, which rapidly reacts with olefins in an anti&#8208;Markovnikov fashion. The method was applied to synthesize 24 different aminochlorinated compounds.

         <title>Mimicking the CuD Site of pMMO via a Copper Cage&#8208;Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper cage complex is presented that mimics the CuD site of particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO). The CuD site has recently been proposed to be the activite site of pMMO. The cage complex presented here can catalyze aerobic oxidations of organic substrates such as benzylic alcohols to aldehydes and hydroquinones to quinones.







Abstract
The mechanism of action of particulate monooxygenase (pMMO) has yet to be determined. The CuD site with two histidines and an asparagine coordinating to copper has been identified as a potential active site of pMMO. Here, we present a copper cage complex, that assembles this coordination sphere, being a structural mimic of the pMMO. The cage is capable to catalyze aerobic oxidations of organic substrates such as benzylic alcohols to aldehydes and hydroquinones to quinones. This is inspired by the reactivity that is observed for enzymatic active sites possessing copper.

The cage complex presented here can catalyze aerobic oxidations of organic substrates such as benzylic alcohols to aldehydes and hydroquinones to quinones.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanism of action of particulate monooxygenase (pMMO) has yet to be determined. The Cu&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; site with two histidines and an asparagine coordinating to copper has been identified as a potential active site of pMMO. Here, we present a copper cage complex, that assembles this coordination sphere, being a structural mimic of the pMMO. The cage is capable to catalyze aerobic oxidations of organic substrates such as benzylic alcohols to aldehydes and hydroquinones to quinones. This is inspired by the reactivity that is observed for enzymatic active sites possessing copper.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Head&#8208;to&#8208;Tail Packing to Facilitate [2+2] Cycloaddition for Green Synthesis of Cyclobutane Derivatives in Specific Configuration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystalline molecular pairs exhibiting head&#8208;to&#8208;tail packing configurations of diphenylpenta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienenitrile derivatives have been observed to facilitate solid&#8208;state photo&#8208;induced [2+2] cycloadditions, demonstrating remarkable reactivity, stereospecificity, regiospecificity, and chemoselectivity. Such packing arrangements are advantageous as they reduce the activation energy of the reaction and provide more robust intermolecular interactions in comparison to head&#8208;to&#8208;head packed configurations

Abstract
Topological [2+2] cycloaddition is known to provide a convenient synthetic route for cyclobutane derivatives from favorably dispositioned dienes. In this study, new (2Z,4E)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)&#8208;5&#8208;phenylpenta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienenitrile (HDE), (2Z,4E)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)&#8208;5&#8208;(p&#8208;tolyl)penta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienenitrile (MeDE), (2Z,4E)&#8208;5&#8208;(4&#8208;chlorophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)penta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienenitrile (ClDE), (2Z,4E)&#8208;5&#8208;(4&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)penta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienenitrile (BrDE), (2Z,4E)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)&#8208;5&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl) penta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienenitrile (MeODE), and (2Z,4E)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)&#8208;5&#8208;(4&#8208;(dimethylamino)phenyl)penta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienenitrile (MeNDE) were synthesized, and their reactivity and selectivity were investigated in relation to their molecular packing in the respective crystals. HDE and MeDE, with head&#8208;to&#8208;tail (HT) arrangement, yielded only one type of photodimer. On the contrary, ClDE and BrDE, with head&#8208;to&#8208;head (HH) packing, and where the &#8220;olefin pairs&#945;,&#946;&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8221; and &#8220;olefin pairs&#947;,&#948;&#8208;&#947;,&#948;&#8221; satisfy Schimdt's criteria, reacted to a mixture of photoproducts. Kinetics analysis suggests that the reaction rates of HDE and MeDE are higher than those of ClDE and BrDE. This observation may be due to the strong non&#8208;covalent interactions between the potentially reactive olefin pairs as suggested by energy decomposition analysis. Furthermore, the reaction activation energies for photodimerization of the HT&#8208;packed olefin pairs are indeed lower than those of the HH&#8208;arranged ones. The HT packing of the diphenyldienes not only enhances the reactivity in the topological [2+2] cycloaddition but also contributes chemospecificity, regiospecifity, and stereospecificity, all of which are essential for the preparation of specific cyclobutanes derivatives based on photodimerization.

         <title>Pseudo&#8208;Ring Methodology to Control the Conformations of Macrocyclic Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pseudo&#8208;ring grafts represent a powerful conformational control tool in macrocyclic peptides. &#8220;Open&#8221; and &#8220;closed&#8221; conformations can be accessed from a single building block which allow for macrocyclic peptides with unique conformations, lipophilicities and fluorescence.

Abstract
A pseudo&#8208;ring is a medium&#8208;sized cyclic structure, held together by a strong hydrogen bond, that can act as a mimetic of a covalently linked heterocycle. Molecules that contain pseudo&#8208;rings can switch between &#8220;open&#8221; and &#8220;closed&#8221; forms. This paper examines the utility of pseudo&#8208;ring constructs to control conformations and properties of macrocycles. The spectroscopic evidence suggests that the &#8220;open&#8221; and &#8220;closed&#8221; pseudo&#8208;ring&#8208;containing macrocycles differ in their three&#8208;dimensional characteristics, which results in markedly different lipophilicities. The dynamic nature of pseudo&#8208;rings has led to the emergence of tunable fluorescence that should be useful in environment&#8208;sensitive applications.
