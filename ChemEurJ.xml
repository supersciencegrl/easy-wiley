         <title>A multi&#8208;pyridine&#8208;anchored and &#8208;linked bilayer photocathode for water reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of efficient photocathodes is of critical importance for the constructions of promising tandem photoelectrochemical cells. Most known dye&#8208;sensitized photocathodes are prepared with the conventional carboxylic or phosphonic acid anchors and requires the presence of other terminal linking groups to connect catalysts, suffering from high synthetic difficulty and low adsorption stability in aqueous media. Herein, a compact bilayer photocathode is prepared by using a pyrene&#8208;based photosensitizer with multiple terminal pyridine moieties as both the anchoring and linking groups to connect a Co hydrogen&#8208;evolution catalyst to the NiO substrate. The catalyst and dye molecule are assembled in a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer manner on NiO through the metal&#8208;pyridine coordination. This photocathode exhibits good dye adsorption stability in aqueous media. A stable cathodic photocurrent of 70 &#956;A/cm2 has been achieved with H2 being generated at the photocathode under the visible&#8208;light irradiation. The Faraday efficiency of H2 evolution was estimated to be 9.1%. Transient absorption spectral studies suggest that the interfacial hole transfer occurs within a few of picoseconds. The integration of the organic photosensitizer with pyridine anchoring and linking groups is expected to provide a simple method for the fabrication of stable and efficient photocathodes</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral 4&#8208;MeO&#8208;Pyridine (MOPY) Catalyst for Enantioselective Cyclopropanation: Attenuation of Lewis Basicity Leads to Improved Catalytic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of pyridine&#8208;derived organocatalysts aims at the increase of their Lewis basicity, however such an approach is not always efficient. For example, strongly Lewis basic DMAP is completely inefficient as catalyst in the cyclopropanation reaction. Herein we disclose an alternative approach that relies on attenuation of DMAP Lewis basicity. Specifically, the replacement of 4&#8208;dimethylamino substituent in DMAP for 4&#8208;MeO group delivered a highly efficient catalyst for cyclopropanation of electron&#8208;deficient olefins with &#945;&#8208;bromoketones. Kinetic studies provide compelling evidence that the superior catalytic efficiency of 4&#8208;MeO pyridine (MOPY) is to be attributed to the favorable balance between Lewis basicity and leaving group ability. The use of chiral, enantiomerically pure MOPY catalyst has helped to achieve high enantioselectivities (up to 91:9 er) in the previously unreported pyridine&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Generation of Diarylisonaphthofuran and Its Mechanochemical Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction with Epoxynaphthalene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A solid&#8208;state method was developed for generating diarylisonaphthofurans from 1,3&#8208;diaryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydronaphthofuranols. The generated reactive molecules were stable in the solid state and could be stored without any precaution. Their X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed a typical quinoidal structure. Furthermore, the mechanochemical Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 1,3&#8208;diarylisonaphthofurans with epoxynaphthalenes afforded synthetically attractive diepoxypentacenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Azotriptycenes: Photoswitchable Molecular Brakes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The control of molecular motions is a central topic of molecular machine research. Molecular brakes are fundamental building blocks towards such goal as they allow deliberately decelerating specific motions after an outside stimulus is applied. Here we present azotriptycenes as structural framework for light&#8208;controlled molecular brakes. The intrinsic kinetics and their changes upon azotriptycene isomerization are scrutinized comprehensively by a mixed theoretical and variable temperature NMR approach. With azotriptycenes C&#8208;N bond rotation rates can be decelerated or accelerated reversibly by up to five orders of magnitude. Rate change effects are highly localized and are strongest for the C&#8208;N bond connecting a triptycene rotor fragment to the central diazo group. The detailed mechanistic insights provide a solid basis for further conscious design and applications in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Simple Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Dideoxy&#8208;2&#8208;Vinyl Carbohydrates by Tin&#8208;Free Radical Reactions of Xanthates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinyl&#8208;substituted carbohydrates have been synthesized from glycals derived from hexoses and pentoses. Key step is the radical reaction of xanthates in the presence of triethylborane, a nontoxic reagent. The mechanism has been investigated by isolation of various side products, which speak for a reversibility of the cyclopropylmethyl radical ring&#8208;opening. Compared to reactions with tributyltin hydride, higher regioselectivities in favor of the 2&#8208;vinylsubstituted sugars have been obtained. Yields are slightly lower with triethylborane, but all products have been isolated in analytically pure form. The new reaction is applicable to benzyl&#8208; and silyl&#8208;protected carbohydrates, which makes free sugars accessible as well. Overall, more than 15 1,2&#8208;dideoxy&#8208;2&#8208;vinyl carbohydrates have been synthesized from simple precursors in only few steps.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 10&#8208;Membered Azecines through Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Formal [6+4] Cycloaddition and Their Transannular Reaction to Polycyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azecine fragments are frequently presented in natural products and bioactive compounds. However, minor efforts have been devoted to these 10&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycless, and their synthesis is still challenging. We report herein the first catalytic formal [6+4] cycloaddition for the synthesis of 10&#8208;membered azecines. Under palladium catalysis, the reaction of &#948;&#8208;vinylvalerolactones and benzofuran&#8208;derived azadienes proceeds smoothly to afford benzofuran&#8208;fused azecines with high diastereoselectivity in moderate to good yields. A unique transannular reaction of these 10&#8208;membered azecines for the construction of polycyclic compounds is also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Unprecedented Direct Asymmetric Total Syntheses of 5,8&#8217;&#8208;Naphthylisoquinoline Alkaloids from their Fully Substituted Precursors Employing a Novel Nickel/N,N&#8208;ligand&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four different 5,8&#8217;&#8208;coupled naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids have been prepared via a general and concise synthetic pathway directly from the corresponding cross&#8208;coupling reaction precursors. For the cross&#8208;coupling key step, a new Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reaction, employing a Ni/N,N&#8208;ligand&#8208;based catalyst providing the natural products in good yields and high enantiomeric purities, has been developed. Furthermore, we also report on a new approach to the northern 1,8&#8208;dioxynaphthalene building blocks found in the naphthylisoquinoline natural products, utilizing Hartwig's borylation/methylation strategy that allows for the efficient installation of orthogonal protecting groups.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Four different 5,8&#8217;-coupled naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids&lt;/b&gt; have been prepared via a general and concise synthetic pathway directly from the corresponding cross-coupling reaction precursors. For the cross-coupling key step, a new Negishi cross-coupling reaction, employing a Ni/N,N-ligand-based catalyst providing the natural products in good yields and high enantiomeric purities, has been developed. Furthermore, we also report on a new approach to the northern 1,8-dioxynaphthalene building blocks found in the naphthylisoquinoline natural products, utilizing Hartwig's borylation/methylation strategy that allows for the efficient installation of orthogonal protecting groups.

         <title>Function&#8208;Led Design of Covalent&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework Membranes for Precise Ion Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with their customizable architectures and tunable pore functionalities present a significant potential to revolutionize membrane&#8208;based ion&#8208;separation processes. The focus of this Review is to offer a succinct, yet comprehensive discussion of how the unique features of COF membranes can be exploited in a range of ion&#8208;separation applications.







Abstract
Insufficient access to clean water and resources has emerged as one of the most pressing issues affecting people globally. Membrane&#8208;based ion separation has become a focal point of research for the generation of fresh water and the extraction of energy elements. This Review encapsulates recent advancements in the selective ion transport of covalent organic framework (COF) membranes, accomplished by strategically pairing diverse monomers to create membranes with various pore sizes and environments for specific purposes. We first discuss the merits of using COF materials as a basis for fabricating membranes for ion separation. We then explore the development of COF membranes in areas such as desalination, acid recovery, and energy element extraction, with a particular emphasis on the fundamental principles of membrane design. Lastly, we address both theoretical and practical challenges, as well as potential opportunities in the targeted design of ion&#8208;selective membranes. The goal of this Review is to stimulate future investigative efforts in this field, which is of significant scientific and strategic importance.

         <title>Vapor&#8208;Induced Assembly of a Platinum(II) Complex Loaded on Layered Double Hydroxide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anionic PtII complex molecules were electrostatically loaded onto cationic nanosheets of layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles. Although the PtII complexes were loaded discretely onto the nanoparticles in the dry state, when water vapor was adsorbed, the PtII complexes assembled on the nanoparticles owing to the increased mobility the adsorption of water caused in the interstitial space of the LDH aggregates.







Abstract
Controlled self&#8208;assembly of PtII complexes is key to the development of optical and stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, but designing and precisely controlling them is still difficult owing to weak intermolecular interactions. Herein, we report the successful water&#8208;vapor&#8208;induced assembly of an anionic PtII complex [Pt(CN)2(ppy)]&#8722; (Hppy=2&#8208;phenylpyridine) electrostatically loaded onto cationically charged layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles consisting of Mg2+ and Al3+ ions. When the PtII complexes were densely loaded onto the LDH nanoparticles, the assembly was maintained, even in dilute aqueous media. In the case of sparse loading, the PtII complexes were loaded discretely in the dry state; however, when water vapor was adsorbed, the increased mobility of the PtII complexes led to their assembly on the LDH nanoparticles. The presence of water vapor led to a drastic change in luminescence from green to orange.

         <title>Catalytic Inhibition of Base&#8208;Mediated Reactivity by a Self&#8208;Assembled Metal&#8208;Ligand Host</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic Fe4L6 tetrahedral cages with suitably sized cavities can bind the conjugate acids of basic catalysts, favoring their protonation by exogenous water in the system. This allows the catalytic inhibition of base&#8208;mediated reactions in the presence of as little as 5&#8201;% added cage, such as conjugate addition and Knoevenagel reactions.







Abstract
Spacious M4L6 tetrahedra can act as catalytic inhibitors for base&#8208;mediated reactions. Upon adding only 5&#8201;% of a self&#8208;assembled Fe4L6 cage complex, the conversion of the conjugate addition between ethylcyanoacetate and &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene catalyzed by proton sponge can be reduced from 83&#8201;% after 75 mins at ambient temperature to &lt;1&#8201;% under identical conditions. The mechanism of the catalytic inhibition is unusual: the octacationic Fe4L6 cage increases the acidity of exogenous water in the acetonitrile reaction solvent by favorably binding the conjugate acid of the basic catalyst. The inhibition only occurs for Fe4L6 hosts with spacious internal cavities: minimal inhibition is seen with smaller tetrahedra or Fe2L3 helicates. The surprising tendency of the cationic cage to preferentially bind protonated, cationic ammonium guests is quantified via the comprehensive modeling of spectrophotometric titration datasets.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Dependent Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Polarity Switching in Ethylene&#8208;bridged Urea Oligomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible coordination of various anions to a binding site at one terminus of a urea oligomer leads to a global switch in polarity of a linear chain of hydrogen&#8208;bonded ureas. The fluorescence response of a hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;responsive dithiomaleimide fluorophore at the opposite terminus reveals a relayed change in local hydrogen bonding directionality.







Abstract
The reversible coordination of anions to an N,N&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylurea located at a terminus of a linear chain of ethylene&#8208;bridged hydrogen&#8208;bonded ureas triggers a cascade of conformational changes. A series of hydrogen&#8208;bond polarity reversals propagates along the oligomer, leading to a global switch of its hydrogen&#8208;bond directionality. The induced polarity switch, transmitted through four reversible urea groups, results in a change in emission and excitation wavelengths of a fluorophore located at the opposite terminus of the oligomer. The molecule thus behaves as a chemical sensor with a relayed remote spectroscopic response to variations in anion concentration. The polarity switch induced by anion concentration constitutes an artificial communication mechanism for conveying information through oligomeric structures.

         <title>Isonitrile&#8208;Proline &#8208; A Versatile Handle for the Chemoselective Derivatization of Collagen Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isonitrileproline (Inp) is introduced as the first isonitrile&#8208;containing amino acid for solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. The conformation directing properties of the isonitrile group and its effect on the collagen triple helix were elucidated. The value of Inp for peptide derivatization was showcased by a chemoselective ligation with a functional chlorooxime.







Abstract
Functional groups that allow for chemoselective and bioorthogonal derivatization are valuable tools for the labelling of peptides and proteins. The isonitrile is such a group but synthetic methods for its incorporation into peptides by solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis are not known. Here, we introduce (4S)&#8208; and (4R)&#8208;isonitrileproline (Inp) as building blocks for solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. Conformational studies of (4S)&#8208; and (4R)&#8208;Inp and thermal stability analysis of Inp&#8208;containing collagen triple helices revealed that the isonitrile group exerts a stereoelectronic gauche effect. We showcase the value of Inp for bioorthogonal labelling by derivatization of Inp&#8208;containing collagen model peptides (CMPs).

     alt="Isonitrile-Proline - A Versatile Handle for the Chemoselective Derivatization of Collagen Peptides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isonitrileproline (Inp) is introduced as the first isonitrile-containing amino acid for solid-phase peptide synthesis. The conformation directing properties of the isonitrile group and its effect on the collagen triple helix were elucidated. The value of Inp for peptide derivatization was showcased by a chemoselective ligation with a functional chlorooxime.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functional groups that allow for chemoselective and bioorthogonal derivatization are valuable tools for the labelling of peptides and proteins. The isonitrile is such a group but synthetic methods for its incorporation into peptides by solid-phase peptide synthesis are not known. Here, we introduce (4&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)- and (4&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-isonitrileproline (Inp) as building blocks for solid-phase peptide synthesis. Conformational studies of (4&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)- and (4&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-Inp and thermal stability analysis of Inp-containing collagen triple helices revealed that the isonitrile group exerts a stereoelectronic gauche effect. We showcase the value of Inp for bioorthogonal labelling by derivatization of Inp-containing collagen model peptides (CMPs). Dual labelling with a pair of bioorthogonal reactions of a CMP containing Inp and azidoproline residues further highlights the versatility of the new isonitrile-containing amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Green and Facile Preparation of Covalent Organic Frameworks Based on Reaction Medium for Advanced Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

A green way towards COF: In this review, we highlight the research advances in the preparation of COFs based on facile, less dangerous, and greener methods like performing the reaction at ambient temperature or employing aqueous solvents, ionic liquids, and a mixture of organic solvents/water.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as a new class of crystalline, well&#8208;ordered, and porous materials with intermittent constructions, are formed via organic structural parts connected through covalent bonds. These materials have been employed in several fields comprising pollutant adsorption and separation, catalysis, electrical conductivity, gas storage, etc. The preparation of COFs is mainly applied in tubes with high temperatures and degassing treatment. Furthermore, the reaction medium is involved in toxic organic solvents like toluene, dioxane, mesitylene, acetonitrile, and so on. Hence, discovering clean medium and green approaches has attracted wide attention. Recently, facile, less dangerous, and greener methods have been developed for COFs synthesis in diverse applications like performing the reaction at ambient temperature or employing aqueous solvents, ionic liquids, and a mixture of organic solvents/water. This review article summarizes the eco&#8208;friendly production approaches of COFs for diverse applications.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Irradiated Multicomponent Reactions of Aliphatic Amines, Propiolate Acid Esters, and CF3SO2Na for Accessing &#946;&#8208;CF3 Enamines</title>

A novel visible&#8208;light driven two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot multicomponent reactions of aliphatic amines and propiolate acid esters for preparation of &#946;&#8208;CF3 enamines has been reported.







Abstract
A novel one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step multicomponent reaction has been achieved for the preparation of &#946;&#8208;CF3 enamines by using different aliphatic amines, propiolates, and CF3SO2Na as starting material. In this protocol, various aliphatic amines including primary amines, cyclic or acyclic secondary amines were demonstrated to be good coupling partners, and different &#946;&#8208;CF3 enamines were obtained in moderate to good yields. Among them, the primary aliphatic amines only gave pure (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CF3 enamines as products. The synthetic utility of the MCRs strategy was further demonstrated by mild conditions, gram&#8208;scale synthesis and natural sunlight&#8208;induced protocol. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that this trifluoromethylation of C(sp2)&#8722;H involves radical process.

The cover feature shows an industrial environment highlighting the production line conveyor belts on which substrates are inserted into a &#8220;blue light box&#8221; and are converted to the desired products. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301934), F. Penteado, E.&#8197;J. Lenard&#227;o and co&#8208;workers report a sophisticated application of triselenium dicyanide (TSD) in a light&#8208;mediated transformation triggered by the generation of Se&#8208;centered radical species. By exploiting this activation strategy, a library of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl selenocyanates and 2&#8208;phenylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives was satisfactorily prepared under mild reaction conditions.

A jewelry rack represents the square&#8208;lattice of a metal&#8211;organic framework. This is exemplified by a MOF being visible when the jewelry rack is reflected in the table mirror. The earrings on the rack are attached with S&#8722;S hooks that mimic the disulfide bonds used to append functional groups to MOFs in this work. The earrings lacking the S&#8208;hook are left resting on the table, unable to attach to the rack. More information can be found in the Research Article by D.&#8197;T.

         <title>Functional Molecular Crystals from the Arylation of a Halogenoplatinum Complex: Stimuli Responsiveness, Comproportionation, and &#960;&#8208;Bridged Dimerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By converting the halogen moiety of a metal complex into a &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, unique properties such as &#960;&#8208;bridged dimerization and comproportionation can be realized. To illustrate the unique bridging style of the dimer, a diagram of the arrangement of artificial satellites is depicted. The comproportionation is represented by the convergence of two rays, transforming into one ray with both characteristics. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Seki and D. Korenaga (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302333).

         <title>Exploration of the Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Sydnone and Sydnonimine&#8208;Alkyne Cycloaddition Reactions by High&#8208;Throughput Experimentation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactivity of sydnones and sydnonimines toward terminal alkynes under copper catalysis has been explored using High&#8208;Throughput&#8208;Experimentation. A large panel of ligands and reaction conditions have been tested to optimize the copper&#8208;catalyzed sydnone click reaction discovered by our group ten years ago. This screening approach led to the identification of new ligands, which boosted the catalytic properties of copper and allowed the discovery of a new copper&#8208;catalyzed click&#8208;and&#8208;release reaction involving sydnonimines. This reaction allowed chemoselective ligation of terminal alkynes with sydnonimines and, simultaneously, the release of an isocyanate fragment molecule that can be used for further transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorination Influences the Bioisostery of Myo&#8208;Inositol Pyrophosphate Analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inositol pyrophosphates (PP&#8208;IPs) are densely phosphorylated messenger molecules involved in numerous biological processes. PP&#8208;IPs contain one or two pyrophosphate group(s) attached to a phosphorylated myo&#8208;inositol ring. 5PP&#8208;IP5 is the most abundant PP&#8208;IP in human cells. To investigate the function and regulation by PP&#8208;IPs in biological contexts, metabolically stable analogs have been developed. Here, we report the synthesis of a new fluorinated phosphoramidite reagent and its application for the synthesis of a difluoromethylene bisphosphonate analog of 5PP&#8208;IP5. Subsequently, the properties of all currently reported analogs were benchmarked using a number of biophysical and biochemical methods, including co&#8208;crystallization, ITC, kinase activity assays and chromatography. Together, the results showcase how small structural alterations of the analogs can have notable effects on their properties in a biochemical setting and will guide in the choice of the most suitable analog(s) for future investigations.</dc:description>

         <title>Naphthalene&#8208;Embedded Multi&#8208;Resonance Emitters Enabling Efficient Narrow Emissive Blue OLEDs
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naphthalene&#8208;embedded multi&#8208;resonance blue emitters based on N&#8722;B&#8722;O frameworks with different structural variation for finely tuning the photophysical properties, which enables effcient narrowband emissive organic light emitting diodes have been designed and investigated.







Abstract
Great achievements have been made in the development of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes in recent decades. However, achieving high color purity for blue emitters remains a challenge. In this study, we have designed and synthesized three naphthalene (NA)&#8208;embedded multi&#8208;resonance (MR) emitters, named SNA, SNB and SNB1, based on N&#8722;B&#8722;O frameworks with isomer variations for finely adjusting the photophysical properties. These emitters show tunable blue emission with emission peaks of 450&#8211;470&#8197;nm. Small full width of half maximum (FWHM) of 25&#8211;29&#8197;nm are achieved in these emitters, indicating the well maintaining of molecular rigidity and MR effect with NA extension. Such design also ensures a fast radiative decay. However, no obvious delayed fluorescence is observed in all three emitters due to the relatively large energy differences between the first singlet and triplet excited states. Both SNA and SNB enable high electroluminescent (EL) performance in doped devices with external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 7.2 and 7.9&#8201;%, respectively. When applying the sensitized strategy, devices based on SNA and SNB show huge improvement with EQE of 29.3 and 29.1&#8201;%. More importantly, SNB with twist geometry enables stable EL spectra with almost unchanged FWHM under different doping concentrations. This work demonstrates the potential of NA extension design in constructing narrowband emissive blue emitters.

         <title>Synthesis of 4&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;4&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;d&#8208;Sedoheptulose: A Promising New Sugar to Apply the Principle of Metabolic Trapping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of 4&#8208;deoxy&#8208;4&#8208;fluorosedoheptulose (4DFS) and 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;3&#8208;fluorosedoheptulose (3DFS) as well as of suitable precursors for the synthesis of their [18F]&#8208;analogues is described. First biochemical investigations show that 4DFS is taken up by human fibroblasts and phosphorylated (giving 4DFS7P) but not further metabolized by transaldolase or transketolase. Thus, 4DFS has a high potential as new pentose phosphate pathway imaging probe.







Abstract
Fluorinated carbohydrates are important tools for understanding the deregulation of metabolic fluxes and pathways. Fluorinating specific positions within the sugar scaffold can lead to enhanced metabolic stability and subsequent metabolic trapping in cells. This principle has, however, never been applied to study the metabolism of the rare sugars of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). In this study, two fluorinated derivatives of d&#8208;sedoheptulose were designed and synthesized: 4&#8208;deoxy&#8208;4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;d&#8208;sedoheptulose (4DFS) and 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;d&#8208;sedoheptulose (3DFS). Both sugars are taken up by human fibroblasts but only 4DFS is phosphorylated. Fluorination of d&#8208;sedoheptulose at C&#8208;4 effectively halts the enzymatic degradation by transaldolase and transketolase. 4DFS thus has a high potential as a new PPP imaging probe based on the principle of metabolic trapping. Therefore, the synthesis of potential radiolabeling precursors for 4DFS for future radiofluorinations with fluorine&#8208;18 is presented.

         <title>Ring Strain Energy of Diheteropnictogeniranes El2Pn (Pn=N, P, As, Sb)&#8211; Accurate versus Additive Approaches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accurate ring strain energies (RSE) were computed for a wide set of (dielementa)pnictogeniranes (El2Pn). Together with other reported rings, an additive methodology was developed by least squares regression using either atom&#8208; or bond&#8208;strain parameters, achieving a very acceptable accuracy. Factors affecting RSE were analyzed, including aromaticity and its differentiation from atom&#8208;centred diatropic currents.







Abstract
Accurate ring strain energy (RSE) values for sixty&#8208;six parent pnictogeniranes having two other identical p&#8208;block elements, El2Pn, have been reported. A decrease in RSE was observed to correlate with an increase in the p character of the AO used in endocyclic bonds, which is particularly remarkable on descending the groups 15 and 16. The latter also parallels higher &#8208;NICS(1) values, which seems not to be related with an increase in aromaticity, as pointed out by other NICS&#8208;related criteria, but to atom&#8208;centred diatropic currents mostly arising from the presence of lone pairs. Only in case of pnictogenaditrieliranes Tr2Pn (Tr=B, Al, Ga), the decrease of &#8208;NICS(1) is related to a lower H&#252;ckel&#8208;type 2&#960;&#8208;electron aromaticity on descending group 13. The use of an additive methodology based on atom&#8208;strain contributions enables estimation of RSEs for a large majority of all possible three&#8208;membered rings containing group 13&#8211;16 elements with modest accuracy (RMSE=4.371&#8197;kcal/mol), that could be remarkably improved by using bond&#8208;strain contributions (RMSE=1.183&#8197;kcal/mol) instead.

Abstract
A mechanochemistry&#8208;driven practical and efficient synthetic protocol for accessing diverse series of biologically relevant poly&#8208;functionalized 5&#8208;(arylselanyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles through copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed click reaction between aryl/heteroaryl acetylenes, diaryl diselenides, benzyl bromides, and sodium azide has been accomplished under high&#8208;speed ball&#8208;milling. Advantages of this method include operational simplicity, avoidance of using solvent and external heating, one&#8208;pot synthesis, short reaction time in minutes, good to excellent yields, broad substrate scope, and gram&#8208;scale applications. Furthermore, synthesized organoselenium compounds were synthetically diversified to biologically promising selenones.

         <title>Mechanochemical Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Carbon&#8208;Sulfur Bond Formation between Aryl Iodides and Aromatic Sulfur Surrogates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green and mild carbon&#8208;sulfur coupling was realized by nickel catalysis under ball&#8208;milling conditions. The desired thioether products were generated from aryl iodides and aromatic thiol/disulfides with broad substrate scope. The Ni(i)/Ni(III) catalytic cycle was facilitated by the mechanochemistry process, thus providing an eco&#8208;friendly and time&#8208;saving strategy for the construction of the C&#8722;S bond in practical synthetic chemistry.







Abstract
The formation of aromatic thioethers from C&#8722;S coupling is of great importance in synthetic chemistry. Traditional solution strategies through transition&#8208;metal catalysis generally require bulk solution, heat, and longer reaction time. Herein, a mechano&#8208;promoted sulfenylation of aryl iodides with nickel catalysis is described. The active aromatic sulfide agents are in&#8208;situ generated from aromatic thiol or disulfide and subsequently adapted in the nickel catalytic cycle, with a tolerance of broad substituted groups under optimized conditions. In addition to the gram&#8208;scale synthesis that reveals the application potential of the method, the radical trapping and competitive experiments are also conducted for the mechanistic study, thus providing a plausible mechanism rationally. Furthermore, the proposed methodology is certificated as being versatile and following the green principles with ideal calculated values of green chemistry metrics, and the comparison with other approaches for C&#8722;S bond formation is also demonstrated.

         <title>Dual Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Nitrogen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia is vital for fertilizer production, hydrogen storage, and alternative fuels. The conventional Haber&#8208;Bosch process for ammonia production is energy&#8208;intensive and environmentally harmful. Designing environmentally friendly and low&#8208;energy consumption strategies for electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (ENRR) in mild conditions is meaningful. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have been studied extensively for NRR due to their high atomic utilization and unique electronic structure but are limited by their poor faradic efficiency and low ammonia formation yield. Dual single&#8208;atom catalysts (DSACs) have recently emerged as a promising solution for the effective activation of molecular N2, providing diverse active sites and synergistic interactions between adjacent atoms. In this review, we summarize the latest advances in metal DSACs for electrochemical ENRR based on both theoretical calculations and experimental studies, including aspects such as their variety, coordination, support, N2 adsorption and activity mechanisms, the characterization of NRR and electrochemical cell Configuration. We also address challenges and prospects in this rapidly evolving field, providing a comprehensive overview of DSACs for ENRR.</dc:description>

         <title>A 3D Covalent Organic Framework with In&#8208;situ Formed Pd Nanoparticles for Efficient Electrochemical Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction was prepared by in&#8197;situ formation of palladium nanoparticle (Pd NPs) within a three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (COF) and carbonization. Due to the homogeneous dispersion and uniform size of Pd NPs, the catalyst reached a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.906&#8197;V, providing a new idea for cathode catalysts of fuel cells and zinc&#8208;air batteries.







Abstract
Non&#8208;platinum noble metals are highly desirable for the development of highly active, stable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts for fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries. However, how to improve the utilization of non&#8208;platinum noble metals is an urgent issue. Herein, a highly efficient catalyst for ORR was prepared through homogeneous loading of Pd precursors by a domain&#8208;limited method in a three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (COF) followed by pyrolysis. The morphology of the Pd nanoparticles (Pd NPs) was well maintained after carbonization, which was attributed to the rigid structure of the 3D COF. Thanks to the uniform distribution of Pd NPs in the carbon, the catalyst exhibited a remarkable half&#8208;wave potential of 0.906&#8197;V and a Tafel slope of 70&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 in 0.1&#8197;M KOH, surpassing the commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.863&#8197;V and 75&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1). Furthermore, a maximum power density of 144.0&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was achieved at 252&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which was significantly higher than the control battery (105.1&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2). This work not only provides a simple strategy for in&#8208;situ preparation of highly dispersible metal catalysts in COFs, but also offers new insights into the ORR electrocatalysis.

         <title>Elucidating the Excited State Behavior of Pyridyl Pyridinium Systems via Computational and Transient Absorption Studies of Tetrahedral Multichromophoric Arrays and their Model Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of tetrameric molecules with four identical subunits bearing pyridyl pyridinium or bipyridinium moieties has been investigated by means of steady&#8208;state and time resolved spectroscopy and the results are corroborated by computational studies. The behavior of the tetrameric molecules, when compared with that of the corresponding model compounds (one of the four identical arms), highlights a remarkable electronic interaction between the subunits in the array.







Abstract
The tetrahedral shape&#8208;persistent molecule 14+, containing four identical pyridyl pyridinium units connected via a sp3 hybridized carbon atom, has been investigated in detail by means of steady&#8208;state and time resolved spectroscopy. Remarkable photophysical properties are observed, particularly in comparison with protonated and methylated analogues (1H48+, 1Me48+), which exhibit substantially shorter excited state lifetimes and lower emission quantum yields. Theoretical studies have rationalized the behavior of the tetrameric molecules relative to the monomers, with DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations corroborating steady&#8208;state (absorption and emission) and transient absorption spectra. The behavior of the monomeric compounds (each consisting in one of the four identical subunits of the tetramers, i.&#8201;e., 2+, 2H2+ and 2Me2+) considerably differs from that of the tetramers, indicating a strong electronic interaction between the subunits in the tetrameric species, likely promoted by the homoconjugation through the connecting sp3&#8197;C atom. 2+ is characterized by a peculiar S1&#8208;S2 excited state inversion, whereas the short&#8208;lived emitting S1 state of 2H2+ and 2Me2+ exhibits a partial charge&#8208;transfer character, as substantiated by spectro&#8208;electrochemical studies. Among the six investigated systems, only 14+ is a sizeable luminophore (&#934;em=0.15), which is related to the peculiar features of its singlet state.

         <title>Direct Solution&#8208;Phase Synthesis and Functionalization of 2D WSe2 for Ambient Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneous exfoliation and noncovalent functionalization of 2D WSe2 by commercial surfactants containing varying hydrophobic chain length and hydroxyl and mercapto head groups, which contribute to its long&#8208;term stability in aqueous suspension, is described.







Abstract
2H phase tungsten diselenide (WSe2) is a p&#8208;type 2D semiconductor from the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) family with unique optoelectrical properties. Solution phase production of atomically thin WSe2 is challenging due to its instability under ambient conditions. We present a highly efficient and scalable solution method for simultaneously exfoliating and functionalizing WSe2 by leveraging the non&#8208;covalent interaction between mercapto&#8208;group and bulk WSe2. Single and few&#8208;layer 2H phase pure WSe2 sheets of lateral size up to 5&#8197;&#956;m with minimal basal plane defects, as revealed by XPS, Raman and FTIR spectroscopy, are produced in a water&#8208;ethanol mixture. Remarkably, WSe2 dispersion remains stable even at high concentrations (10&#8197;mg/mL) and exhibited high colloidal stability with a shelf&#8208;life exceeding a year. The findings from our study suggest that through precise manipulation of intercalation chemistry, mass production of solution&#8208;processable phase&#8208;sensitive 2D materials such as WSe2 can be achieved. This advancement holds great potential for facilitating their practical utilization in various real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>Electrosynthesis of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films with Well&#8208;Defined Facets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report a facile anodic electrochemical synthesis method for the in&#8208;situ preparation of metal&#8211;organic framework films with well&#8208;defined facets by precisely regulating the supersaturation of the growth units. This method provides a powerful toolbox for various applications that require precise control of crystal facets in MOF films.







Abstract
The deposition of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films with defined exposed facets is important to enhance the performance of these films for, for example, catalysis or separations. In this work, MOF films with specific exposed facets are electrodeposited anodically on various substrates (e.&#8201;g. on copper&#8208;sputtered Si wafers, copper meshes, copper foams, and polypropylene membranes). The influence of the deposition parameters, including the pH of the solution, current density, concentration of linker, and solvent, on the exposed facets of the deposited MOFs was investigated. The results suggest that precise control over the supersaturation during anodic deposition is a possible strategy for synthesizing MOF crystals with well&#8208;defined exposed facets. This approach provides a powerful toolbox for various applications requiring crystal facet control of MOF films.

         <title>Tunable Chromic Properties of Viologen&#8208;Metal Polymers Modulated by Coordination Modes for Inkless Erasable Printing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the help of theoretical calculations, we predicted that tunable chromic properties of viologen&#8208;metal polymers could be achieved through modulating coordination modes. Two ZnII&#8208;viologen model polymers were successfully synthesized and comparative experimental vigorously confirm bilateral coordination model exhibit quicker stimuli response, stronger color contrast, longer radical lifetime, which also has shown excellent inkless&#8208;erasable&#8208;printing performance.







Abstract
Inkless and erasable printing (IEP) based on chromic materials holds great promise to alleviate environmental and sustainable problems. Metal&#8211;organic polymers (MOPs) are bright platforms for constructing IEP materials. However, it is still challenging to design target MOPs with excellent specific functions rationally due to the intricate component&#8208;structure&#8208;property relationships. Herein, an effective strategy was proposed for the rational design IEP&#8208;MOP materials. The stimuli&#8208;responsive viologen moiety was introduced into the construction of MOPs to give it potential chromic behaviors and two different coordination models (i.&#8201;e. bilateral coordination model, M1; unilateral coordinated model, M2) based on the same viologen ligand were designed. Aided by theoretical calculations, model M1 was recommended secondarily as a more suitable system for IEP materials. Along this line, two representative viologen&#8208;ZnII MOPs 1 and 2 with models M1 and M2 were synthesized successfully. Experiments exhibit that 1 does have quicker stimuli response, stronger color contrast and longer radical lifetime compared to 2. Significantly, the obtained 1&#8208;IEP media brightly inherits the excellent chromic characteristics of 1 and the flexibility of the paper at the same time, which achieves most daily printing requirements, as well as enough resolution and durability to be used in identification by smart device.

         <title>Probing Interactions between Chiral Plasmonic Nanoparticles and Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detecting interactions: This review of the interactions between chiral plasmonic nanoparticle systems and biomolecules focuses on the application of circular dichroism spectroscopy to probe such interactions, toward biosensing applications.







Abstract
Chiral plasmonic nanoparticles (and their assemblies) interact with biomolecules in a variety of different ways, resulting in distinct optical signatures when probed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. These systems show promise for biosensing applications and offer several advantages over achiral plasmonic systems. Arguably the most notable advantage is that chiral nanoparticles can differentiate between molecular enantiomers and can, therefore, act as sensors for enantiomeric purity. Furthermore, chiral nanoparticles can couple more effectively to chiral biomolecules in biological systems if they have a matching handedness, improving their effectiveness as biomedical agents. In this article, we review the different types of interactions that occur between chiral plasmonic nanoparticle systems and biomolecules, and discuss how circular dichroism spectroscopy can probe these interactions and inform how to optimize systems for biosensing and biomedical applications.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Polycyclic 4,5&#8208;Dihydropyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones by Inverse Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) Reactions from Alkenes</title>

         <dc:description>
A new practical catalyst&#8208;free method for one&#8208;pot synthesis of polycyclic 4,5&#8208;pyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones from alkenes was developed. 4,5&#8208;Pyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones were obtained in high yields in the presence of water by Inverse Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reactions between norbornene and barrelene&#8208;derived polycyclic alkenes, and s&#8208;tetrazines with leaving groups at the 3,6&#8208;positions. This method also worked successfully in monocyclic alkene cyclopentene and linear alkene styrene.







Abstract
In the classical Inverse Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reactions between alkenes and tetrazines, 4,5&#8208;dihydropyridazines are formed. 4,5&#8208;Dihydropyridazines are rapidly converted to the more energetically stable 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridazines by 1,3&#8208;prototropic isomerization. In this study, instead of 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridazines, 4,5&#8208;dihydropyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones were obtained as a result of IEDDA reactions between tetrazines with leaving groups at the 3,6&#8208;positions, and norbornene and barrelene&#8208;derived polycyclic alkenes in the presence of moisture in air or solvent. To show that this new method works not only on strained polycyclic alkenes but also on monocyclic and linear alkenes, the corresponding 4,5&#8208;dihydropyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones were obtained in high yields from the reactions performed with styrene and cyclopentene as well. The chemical structures of the polycyclic 4,5&#8208;dihydropyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones were determined by NMR and HRMS analyses. In addition, the exact structures of the polycyclic 4,5&#8208;dihydropyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones were also experimentally proven by converting them to pyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones known in the literature.

         <title>The Effect of Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonds on the Rotational Barriers of the Biaryl C&#8722;C Axis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we show that the transition state of atropisomerization of tri&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted biaryl was stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonds, resulting in a significant reduction in the steric repulsion around C&#8722;C axes and a decrease in the energy barrier of atropisomerization (&#916;&#916;G&#8800;(10&#8208;9)=46.7&#8197;kJ/mol).







Abstract
Axially chiral compounds are attracting more attention recently. Although hydrogen bonds are reported as a vital weak force that influences the properties of compounds, the effect of intramolecular hydrogen bonds on the atropisomerization of the Caryl&#8722;Caryl single bonds has not yet been well quantitatively investigated. Here, a series of axially chiral biaryl compounds were synthesized to study the effect of hydrogen bonds on the rotational barriers of the biaryl C&#8722;C axis. Experimental studies demonstrated that the rotational barrier of hydrogen bonding biaryl 9 was significantly lower (46.7&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) than biaryl 10 without hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, theoretical studies revealed that the intramolecular hydrogen bond stabilized the transition state (TS) of tri&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted biaryl 9, relieving the steric repulsion in the TS. We believe that this study will provide chemists with a deeper understanding of the atropisomerization process of axially chiral biaryl compounds.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Redox and Optical Properties of 5,10,15,20&#8208;Tetraaryl&#8208;5&#8208;azaporphyrinium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;templated annulation method is established for the synthesis of 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraaryl&#8208;5&#8208;monoazaporphyrinium (TAMAP) salts, which exhibit characteristic redox and optical properties reflecting the electronic effects of the meso&#8208;nitrogen atom. The zinc complex of TAMAP salt generated singlet oxygen in quantum yield of 0.77 under irradiation with visible light.







Abstract
The fundamental properties of azaporphyrins can be modulated over a wide range by changing the number of meso&#8208;nitrogen atoms. Reported herein are the first examples of 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraaryl&#8208;5&#8208;azaporphyrinium (MTAMAP) salts, which were prepared via metal&#8208;templated cyclization of the corresponding zinc(II) and copper(II) complexes of 10&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;chloro&#8208;19&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;5,15&#8208;dimesityl&#8208;10&#8208;azabiladiene&#8208;ac. The inclusion of one meso&#8208;nitrogen atom in the 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraarylporphyrin skeleton considerably changes the redox and optical properties as well as the degree of aromaticity of the porphyrin ring. The present findings suggest that MTAMAP salts would be promising scaffolds for the development of new azaporphyrin&#8208;based ionic fluorophores and photosensitizers.

         <title>Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Metadynamics for the Elucidation of the Binding Modes and Free Energy Landscape of Drug/Target Interactions: a Case Study</title>

Machine Learning&#8208;powered metadynamics enabling the unbiased selection of collective variables to describe the binding free energy of a non&#8208;covalent metallodrug/DNA G&#8208;quadruplex adduct and the effects of water solvation.







Abstract
In the context of drug discovery, computational methods were able to accelerate the challenging process of designing and optimizing a new drug candidate. Amongst the possible atomistic simulation approaches, metadynamics (metaD) has proven very powerful. However, the choice of collective variables (CVs) is not trivial for complex systems. To automate the process of CVs identification, two different machine learning algorithms were applied in this study, namely DeepLDA and Autoencoder, to the metaD simulation of a well&#8208;researched drug/target complex, consisting in a pharmacologically relevant non&#8208;canonical DNA secondary structure (G&#8208;quadruplex) and a metallodrug acting as its stabilizer, as well as solvent molecules.

         <title>Surface Modification of ITO with N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Precursors Results in Electron Selective Contacts in Organic Photovoltaic Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modify ITO: Bench stable IPr&#8208;CO2 adduct is employed for the modification of ITO electrodes by spin coating method which develops surface dipoles with dipole moments pointing away from the ITO layer. As a result, the work function of the modified ITO electrodes has reduced significantly which provides a potentially high electron selectivity contact in corresponding OPV devices and a high VOC performance in organic solar cells.







Abstract
Surface modification of indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes with organic molecules is known to tune their work function which results in higher charge carrier selectivity in corresponding organic electronic devices and hence influences the performance of organic solar cells. In recent years, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have also been proven to be capable to modify the work function of metals and semimetals compared to the unfunctionalized surface via the formation of strong covalent bonds. In this report, we have designed and performed the modification of the ITO surface with NHC by using the zwitterionic bench stable IPr&#8208;CO2 as the NHC precursor, applied via spin coating. Upon modification, the work function of ITO electrodes was reduced significantly which resulted in electron selective contacts in corresponding organic photovoltaic devices. In addition, various characterization techniques and analytical methods are used to elucidate the nature of the bound species and the corresponding binding mechanism of the material to the ITO surface.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization of Yndiamides with Isoxazoles via &#945;&#8208;Imino Gold Fischer Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold catalysis is an important method for alkyne functionalization. Here we report the gold&#8208;catalyzed formal [3+2] aminative cyclization of yndiamides and isoxazoles in a direct synthesis of polysubstituted diaminopyrroles, which are important motifs in drug discovery. Key to this process is the formation, and subsequent cyclization, of an &#945;&#8208;imino gold Fischer carbene, which represents a new type of gold carbene intermediate. The reaction proceeds rapidly under mild conditions, with high regioselectivity being achieved by introducing a subtle steric bias between the nitrogen substituents on the yndiamide. DFT calculations revealed that the key to this regioselectivity was the interconversion of isomeric gold keteniminiun ions via a low&#8208;barrier &#960;&#8208;complex transition state, which establishes a Curtin&#8208;Hammett scenario for isoxazole addition. By using benzisoxazoles as substrates, the reaction outcome could be switched to a formal [5+2] cyclization, leading to 1,4&#8208;oxazepines.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Study on Selenium&#8208; and Sulfur&#8208;mediated Isomerization of Hydroxamic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present an in&#8208;depth computational study revealing the intriguing mechanism of the recently reported isomerization of hydroxamic acids into para&#8208;aminophenols catalyzed by phenylselenyl bromide under mild conditions. Our computations not only align with the reported experimental data, effectively explaining observed phenomena such as para&#8208;selectivity but also shed light on crucial aspects of the reaction mechanism that establish limitations on the scope of the studied rearrangement. Additionally, we performed a joint theoretical/experimental study to examine the potency of the phenylsulfenyl bromide to mediate the reaction under the same conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolation, Characterization and Reactivity of Key Intermediates Relevant to Reductive (Electro)catalysis with Cp*Rh Complexes containing Pyridyl&#8208;MIC (MIC = Mesoionic Carbene) Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, metal complexes of pyridyl&#8208;mesoionic carbene (MIC) ligands have been reported as excellent homogeneous and molecular electrocatalysts. In combination with group 9 metals, such ligands form highly active catalysts for hydrogenation/transfer hydrogenation/hydrosilylation catalysis and electrocatalysts for dihydrogen production. Despite such progress, very little is known about the structural/electrochemical/spectroscopic properties of crucial intermediates for such catalytic reactions with these ligands: solvato complexes, reduced complexes and hydridic species. We present here a comprehensive study involving the isolation, crystallographic characterization, electrochemical/spectroelectrochemical/theoretical investigations, and in&#8208;situ reactivity studies of all the aforementioned crucial intermediates involving Cp*Rh and pyridyl&#8208;MIC ligands. A detailed mechanistic study of the precatalytic activation of [RhCp*] complexes with pyridyl&#8208;MIC ligands is presented. Intriguingly, amphiphilicity of the [RhCp*]&#8208;hydride complexes was observed, displaying the substrate dependent transfer of H+, H&#8729; or H&#8722;. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first of its kind targeting intermediates and reactive species involving metal complexes of pyridyl&#8208;MIC ligands and investigating the interconversion amongst them.</dc:description>

         <title>Transformation of Highly Hydrophobic Triarylphosphines into Amphiphiles via Staudinger Reaction with Hydrophilic Trichlorophenyl Azide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to its hydrophobic properties and reactivity, triarylphosphines (PAr3) are promising precursors for the development of new amphiphiles. However, an efficient and reliable synthetic method for amphiphiles based on highly hydrophobic PAr3 is still required. Herein, we report a straightforward transformation of highly hydrophobic PAr3 into amphiphiles via the Staudinger reaction. By simply mixing PAr3 and a hydrophilic trichlorophenyl azide containing two hydrophilic chains, amphiphiles bearing a N=P bond (i.e., an azaylide moiety) were quantitatively formed. The obtained azaylide&#8208;based amphiphiles were remarkably water&#8208;soluble, enabling their spontaneous self&#8208;assembly into 2 nm&#8208;sized micelles composed of 4&#8211;5 molecules in water with a low critical micelle concentration (up to 0.05 mM or less) due to the effective intermolecular interactions among the hydrophobic surfaces. Although the azaylide moiety is easily hydrolyzed in the presence of water, the azaylide in the amphiphiles displayed notable stability in water even at 60 h, which stems from the LUMO modulation induced by the presence of three electron&#8208;withdrawing chloro groups and two twisted alkoxycarbonyl groups, according to DFT calculations. An amphiphile having a large hydrophobic surface solubilized various hydrophobic organic dyes through efficient intermolecular interactions, resulting in the dyes exhibiting either monomer or excimer emissions in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Reduced Graphene Oxide Modulated FeSe/C Anode Materials for High&#8208;Stable and Long&#8208;Life Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has been demonstrated to effectively enhance the potassium storage performance of transition metal selenides due to its robust mechanical properties and high conductivity.  However, the impact of rGO on the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, a crucial factor in the electrochemical performance of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs), requires further exploration. In this study, we synthesized a seamless architecture of rGO on FeSe/C nanocrystals (FeSe/C@rGO). Comparative analysis between FeSe/C and FeSe/C@rGO reveals that the rGO layer exhibits robust adsorption energies towards EC and DEC, inducing the formation of organic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) without damage to the structural integrity. Furthermore, incorporating rGO triggers K+&#8208;ions into the double electrode layer (EDL), markedly improving the transport of K+&#8208;ions. As a PIB anode, FeSe/C@rGO exhibits a reversible capacity of 332 mAh g&#8208;1 at 200 mA g&#8208;1 after 300 cycles, along with excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability, showcasing an ultralow decay rate of only 0.086% per cycle after 1900 cycles at 1000 mA g&#8208;1.</dc:description>

N&#8208;alkylation of diazo compounds: Value&#8208;added to industry waste diazo compounds using feedstock alcohols under earth&#8208;abundant manganese catalysis.alcoholdehydrogenative couplingdrug intermediateshydrogenkinetic studiesmanganese







Abstract
Sustainable chemical production requires fundamentally new types of catalysts and catalytic technologies. The development of coherent and robust catalytic systems based on earth&#8208;abundant transition metals is essential, but highly challenging. Herein, we systematically explored a general hydrogenative cleavage/N&#8208;alkylation tandem of cyclic and acyclic diazo (N=N) compounds to value&#8208;added amines under manganese catalysis. The reaction is catalyzed by a single&#8208;site molecular manganese complex and proceeds via tandem dehydrogenation, transfer hydrogenation, and borrowing hydrogenation strategies. Interestingly, the reaction involves abundantly available renewable feedstocks, such as alcohols, that can act as (transfer)hydrogenating and alkylating agents. The synthetic application of our approach in large&#8208;scale pharmaceutical synthesis and easy access to highly demanding N&#8208;CH3/CD3 derivatives are also demonstrated. Kinetic studies show that the reaction rate depends on the concentration of alcohol and Mn&#8208;catalyst and follows fractional orders. Several selective bond activation/formation reactions occur sequentially via amine&#8211;amide metal&#8208;ligand cooperation.

         <title>Chiroptical Recognition of Carboxylates with Charge&#8208;Neutral Double&#8208;Stranded Zinc(II) Helicates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isomer truel &#8208; The guest calls out the winner. The dynamic interconversion of a neutral metal&#8208;based container&#8208;like helicate enables chiroptical recognition of chiral mono&#8208; and dicarboxylates by CD spectroscopy. Efficient guest recognition paired with an optimal chiral information transfer resulting from a coordinative binding mode allows the usage of the receptor for chirality analysis.







Abstract
Chirality analysis of small molecules for the determination of their enantiopurity is nowadays ruled by streamlined chromatographic methods which utilize chiral stationary phases. Chiroptical probes which rely on host&#8211;guest interactions are so far overshadowed by the latter but have the benefit of depending only on common spectroscopic techniques such as CD spectroscopy to distinguish enantiomers and to quantify their ratio. Interest into this receptor&#8208;based approach is constantly rising because non&#8208;invasive high&#8208;throughput screenings with a minimal waste production can be performed. In this study we investigate the possibility to utilize metal&#8208;based containers in form of charge&#8208;neutral helicates able to recognize anions for this purpose. Key building block of the helicates are triazole units which show rotational freedom and give rise to either a meso&#8208;structure or a racemic mixture of the right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed complex.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isomer truel - The guest calls out the winner&lt;/b&gt;. The dynamic interconversion of a neutral metal-based container-like helicate enables chiroptical recognition of chiral mono- and dicarboxylates by CD spectroscopy. Efficient guest recognition paired with an optimal chiral information transfer resulting from a coordinative binding mode allows the usage of the receptor for chirality analysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chirality analysis of small molecules for the determination of their enantiopurity is nowadays ruled by streamlined chromatographic methods which utilize chiral stationary phases. Chiroptical probes which rely on host&#8211;guest interactions are so far overshadowed by the latter but have the benefit of depending only on common spectroscopic techniques such as CD spectroscopy to distinguish enantiomers and to quantify their ratio. Interest into this receptor-based approach is constantly rising because non-invasive high-throughput screenings with a minimal waste production can be performed. In this study we investigate the possibility to utilize metal-based containers in form of charge-neutral helicates able to recognize anions for this purpose. Key building block of the helicates are triazole units which show rotational freedom and give rise to either a &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-structure or a racemic mixture of the right- and left-handed complex. A chiroptical response of the probe is observed upon recognition of chiral mono- or dicarboxylates and chirality analysis of tartrate is conducted by CD spectroscopy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Flow Synthesis of Cycloparaphenylene Building Blocks on a Large Scale</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cycloparaphenylenes ([n]CPPs) and similar nanohoops are accessible by combining building blocks. Herein, we report a continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of key CPP building blocks by using self&#8208;built reactors on up&#8208;to kilogram scale. This fast and large&#8208;scale access opens new possibilities for further research in the field of curved aromatic compounds.







Abstract
The synthesis of [n]cycloparaphenylenes ([n]CPPs) and similar nanohoops is usually based on combining building blocks to a macrocyclic precursor, which is then aromatized in the final step. Access to those building blocks in large amounts will simplify the synthesis and studies of CPPs as novel functional materials for applications. Herein, we report a continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of key CPP building blocks by using versatile synthesis techniques such as electrochemical oxidation, lithiations and Suzuki cross&#8208;couplings in self&#8208;built reactors on up&#8208;to kilogram scale.

         <title>Gated Photochromism of Dithienylethene&#8208;Embedded Expanded Calixphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DTE&#8208;embedded expanded calixphyrins exhibit reversible photochromism. The closed forms of these porphyrinoids are oxidized with DDQ to lock the recorded information by converting to photochemically inactive expanded porphyrins, which can be reduced with NaBH4 to restore the photochromism activity. This gated photochromic behavior was demonstrated in PMMA film.







Abstract
Dithienylethene (DTE)&#8208;embedded expanded porphyrins were synthesized and confirmed to be photochemically inactive due to the lowest excited state of the expanded porphyrins. On the other hand, DTE&#8208;embedded expanded calixphyrins exhibited reversible photochromism upon UV&#8208;irradiation to form colored closed forms, which reverted to colorless open forms upon red&#8208;light irradiation. The closed forms were oxidized with DDQ or the air to lock the recorded information by converting to photochemically inactive expanded porphyrins. This was unlocked by reduction with NaBH4 to restore expanded calixphyrins with photochromism activity. These gated photochromic behaviors were demonstrated in PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate) film.

         <title>Diverse Reactions of Formazanate/Formazan with Tetrylenes: Reduction, C&#8722;H Bond Activation, Substitution and Addition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diverse redox chemistry of formazanate/formazan with low&#8208;valent group&#8197;14 compounds is inverstigated. Both formazanate potassium salt and neutral formazan ligands were subjected to reactions with tetrylenes. In the former case, the anticipated salt metathesis reactions occurred, accompanied by unexpected reduction/insertion and C&#8722;H activation. The latter reactions displayed substitution and addition reaction patterns.







Abstract
The reactivity of the formazanate potassium salt [LtBuK(thf)] (LtBu=PhNNC(4&#8208;tBuPh)NNPh) with the group&#8197;14 chlorotetrylenes [{PhC(tBuN)2}ECl] (E=Si, Ge, Sn) was investigated. Three corresponding compounds with unique configurations were formed, demonstrating the diverse reactivity of the system. In addition to the anticipated salt metathesis reactions of the potassium salt with the chlorine function of tetrylenes, unexpected reduction/insertion steps into the N=N bond of the formazanate (Si, Ge) and subsequent C&#8722;H activation (Ge) were also observed. Furthermore, when the neutral formazan ligand [LtBuH] was exposed to silylenes [{PhC(tBuN)2}SiCl] and [LPhSiNMePy], substitution and addition reactions occurred. These discoveries significantly enrich the diversity of formazanate/formazan redox chemistry, opening up new avenues for exploration in this field.

Mono&#8208;boryl complexes: The synthesis of the first terminal mono&#8208;boryl complexes of nickel, which are not stabilized by a pincer ligand, is reported.







Abstract
The synthesis of the first terminal mono&#8208;boryl complexes of nickel, which are not stabilized by a pincer ligand, is reported. The reaction of the nickel bis&#8208;boryl complex cis&#8208;[Ni(iPr2ImMe)2(Bcat)2] 1 (cat=1,2&#8208;O2C6H4) with the small donor ligand PMe3 led to a complete ligand exchange at nickel with reductive elimination of B2cat2 and formation of the bis&#8208;NHC adduct [B2cat2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(iPr2ImMe)2] 3 and [Ni(PMe3)4] 2 as the metal&#8208;containing species. Electrophilic attack of MeI on complex 1 or ligand dismutation of 1 with trans&#8208;[Ni(iPr2ImMe)2Br2] led to loss of only one boryl ligand of 1 and afforded the nickel mono&#8208;boryl complexes trans&#8208;[Ni(iPr2ImMe)2(Bcat)Br] 4&#8201;a and trans&#8208;[Ni(iPr2ImMe)2(Bcat)I] 4&#8201;b.

         <title>A Preference for Heterolepticity &#8208; Schlenk Type Equilibria in Organometallic Beryllium Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of homoleptic beryllium halide with diphenyl beryllium complexes leads to the clean formation of heteroleptic beryllium Grignard compounds [(L)1&#8208;2BePhX]1&#8208;2 (X=Cl, Br, I; L=C&#8208;, N&#8208;, O&#8208;donor ligand). The influence of ligands and solvent on these compounds, their formation and exchange equilibria in solution were investigated, together with the factors determining the complex constitution.

         <title>Multifunctional Roles of Clathrate Hydrate Nanoreactors for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clathrate hydrates act hydrogen&#8208;bonded nanoreactors that possess multifunctional properties, facilitating CO2 reduction such as confinement, tethering, H&#8208;bond catalysis, and proton pumping.







Abstract
In this study, we explore a possible platform for the CO2 reduction (CO2R) in one of water's solid phases, namely clathrate hydrates (CHs), by ab initio molecular dynamics and well&#8208;tempered metadynamics simulations with periodic boundary conditions. We found that the stacked H2O nanocages in CHs help to initialize CO2R by increasing the electron&#8208;binding ability of CO2. The substantial CO2R processes are further influenced by the hydrogen bond networks in CHs. The first intermediate CO2&#8722; in this process can be stabilized through cage structure reorganization into the H&#8208;bonded [CO2&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;OHcage] complex. Further cooperative structural dynamics enables the complex to convert into a vital transient [CO22&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;OHcage] intermediate in a low&#8208;barrier disproportionation&#8208;like process. Such a highly reactive intermediate spontaneously triggers subsequent double proton transfer along its tethering H&#8208;bonds, finally converting it into HCOOH. These hydrogen&#8208;bonded nanoreactors feature multiple functions in facilitating CO2R such as confining, tethering, H&#8208;bond catalyzing and proton pumping. Our findings have a general interest and extend the knowledge of CO2R into porous aqueous systems.

         <title>Re&#8208;Thinking Dimer Design Principles with Indolonaphthyridine Intramolecular Singlet Fission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intramolecular singlet fission (i&#8208;SF) mechanism of INDT dimers linked via para&#8208;phenyl, meta&#8208;phenyl and fluorene bridging groups is investigated. Using ultra&#8208;fast spectroscopy the highest rate of singlet fission is found in the para&#8208;phenyl linked dimer. The mechanistic picture of polarisable singlet fission materials, such as INDT, extends beyond the traditional mechanistic landscape.







Abstract
Singlet fission is a phenomenon that could significantly improve the efficiency of photovoltaic devices. Indolonaphthyridine thiophene (INDT) is a photostable singlet fission material that could potentially be utilised in singlet fission&#8208;based photovoltaic devices. This study investigates the intramolecular singlet fission (i&#8208;SF) mechanism of INDT dimers linked via para&#8208;phenyl, meta&#8208;phenyl and fluorene bridging groups. Using ultra&#8208;fast spectroscopy the highest rate of singlet fission is found in the para&#8208;phenyl linked dimer. Quantum calculations show the para&#8208;phenyl linker encourages enhanced monomer electronic coupling. Increased rates of singlet fission were also observed in the higher polarity o&#8208;dichlorobenzene, relative to toluene, indicating that charge&#8208;transfer states have a role in mediating the process. The mechanistic picture of polarisable singlet fission materials, such as INDT, extends beyond the traditional mechanistic landscape.

         <title>DFT Study of Imine&#8208;Exchange Reactions in Iron(II)&#8208;Coordinated Pincers</title>

Proton shuttle: A DFT study on condensation and transimination reactions of an Fe2+&#8208;coordinated diimine pyridine pincer was conducted. Titration experiments confirmed the use of Fe2+ as a model metal ion, after which the reactions were investigated computationally using traditional four&#8208;membered ring transition states for proton transfer. When those displayed unrealistic high energy barriers, two ethylamines were added to function as proton shuttles, which lowered the activation energies to realistic values.







Abstract
The imine bond is among the most applied motifs in dynamic covalent chemistry. Although its uses are varied and often involve coordination to a transition metal for stability, mechanistic studies on imine exchange reactions so far have not included metal coordination. Herein, we investigated the condensation and transimination reactions of an Fe2+&#8208;coordinated diimine pyridine pincer, employing wB97XD/6&#8208;311G(2d,2p) DFT calculations in acetonitrile. We first experimentally confirmed that Fe2+ is strongly coordinated by these pincers, and is thus a justified model ion. When considering a four&#8208;membered ring&#8208;shaped transition state for proton transfers, the required activation energies for condensation and transimination reaction exceeded the values expected for reactions known to be spontaneous at room temperature. The nature of the incoming and exiting amines and the substituents on the para&#8208;position of the pincer had no effect on this. Replacing Fe2+ with Zn2+ or removing it altogether did not reduce it either. However, the addition of two ethylamine molecules lowered the energy barriers to be compatible with experiment (19.4 and 23.2&#8197;kcal/mol for condensation and transimination, respectively). Lastly, the energy barrier of condensation of a non&#8208;coordinated pincer was significantly higher than found for Fe2+&#8208;coordinating pincers, underlining the catalyzing effect of metal coordination on imine exchange reactions.

This bonding, given also by vanadate units in bromoperoxidase enzymes, is markedly different from the coordination bonds formed by the same elements, and possesses the distinctive features of &#963;&#8208;hole interactions. The term &#8220;erythronium bond&#8221; is proposed to denote this kind bonding to honor Andr&#232;s Manuel del R&#237;o, who discovered vanadium.

         <title>Iminoboranes With Parent B=NH Entity: Imino Group Metathesis, Nucleophilic Reactivity and N&#8722;N Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imine or not Imine? We present a rare example of a parent iminoborane with the unfunctionalized B=NH entity. The reactivity of this rare compound class shows remarkable differences to boron's neighbor element carbon as found in organic imines.







Abstract
While R2C=N&#8722;R double bonds in organic imines are well established, the related iminoboranes R&#8208;B=N&#8722;R are either prone to oligomerization or can only be stabilized at sufficient steric congestion. In particular, the examples of unsubstituted parent B=N&#8208;H entity are rare. We demonstrate that the amino imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;imine ligand system (HAmIm) not only gives rise to the isolation of a parent (AmIm)B=N&#8722;H iminoborane, but also to species of type (AmIm)B=N&#8208;SiMe3 with concomitant stabilization by lithium bromide. The double bond character in these systems is unambiguously corroborated by DFT calculations. The steric accessibility of the (AmIm)B=NH unit allows facile reactivity including metathesis reactions with C=O and C=S bonds, nucleophilic addition toward organic and organometallic carbonyl compounds, but also oxidative N&#8722;N coupling within a dimeric unit. Thus, the chemical behavior of the (AmIm)B=N&#8722;H and (AmIm)B=N&#8208;SiMe3 is distinctly different from that of organic imines.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Catalytic Hydrogenolysis of Chlorosilanes into Hydrosilanes with &#8220;Inverse&#8221; Frustrated Lewis Pairs
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrosilanes can be synthesized from chlorosilanes and H2, thanks to a combination of a superbase and a borane catalyst, forming an inverse FLP. A mechanistic study demonstrates that the key intermediate species is a highly reactive borohydride, arising from H2 heterolytic splitting.







Abstract
The challenging metal&#8208;free catalytic hydrogenolysis of silyl chlorides to hydrosilanes is unlocked by using an inverse frustrated Lewis pair (FLP), combining a mild Lewis acid (Cy2BCl) and a strong phosphazene base (BTPP) in mild conditions (10&#8197;bar of H2, r.&#8201;t.). In the presence of a stoichiometric amount of the base, the hydrosilanes R3SiH (R=Me, Et, Ph) are generated in moderate to high yields (up to 95&#8201;%) from their chlorinated counterparts. A selective formation of the valuable difunctional monohydride Me2SiHCl is also obtained from Me2SiCl2. A mechanism is proposed based on stoichiometric experiments and DFT calculations; it highlights the critical role of borohydride species generated by the heterolytic splitting of H2.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Migratory and Cytotoxic Activities of [Ga(8&#8208;hydroxyquinolinato)3]: Roles of Endogenous Cu(II) and Drug&#8208;Induced Phenotypic Changes</title>

[GaQ3] (Q=8&#8208;hydroxyquinolinato) is the first metal complex likely to induce terminal differentiation in invasive human cancer cells (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231) that could be used in differentiation cancer therapy, when combined with the highly cytotoxic [CuQ2] generated in&#8197;situ by partial ligand release.







Abstract
As shown by IncuCyte Zoom imaging proliferation assays, invasive triple&#8208;negative human breast MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cancer cells treated with sub&#8208;toxic doses (5.0&#8211;20&#8197;&#956;M, 72&#8197;h) of [GaQ3] (Q=8&#8208;hydroxyquinolinato) caused profound morphological changes and inhibition of cell migration, which were likely due to terminal cell differentiation or similar phenotypical change. This is the first demonstration of potential use of a metal complex in differentiation anti&#8208;cancer therapy. Additionally, a trace amount of Cu(II) (0.20&#8197;&#956;M) added to the medium dramatically increased [GaQ3] cytotoxicity (IC50~2&#8197;&#956;M, 72&#8197;h) due to its partial dissociation and the action of the HQ ligand as a Cu(II) ionophore, as shown with electrospray mass spectrometry and fluorescence spectroscopy assays in the medium. Hence, cytotoxicity of [GaQ3] is strongly linked to ligand binding of essential metal ions in the medium, for example, Cu(II). Appropriate delivery mechanisms of such complexes and their ligands could enable a powerful new triple therapeutic approach for cancer chemotherapy, including cytotoxicity against primary tumour, arrest of metastases, and activation of innate and adaptive immune responses.

         <title>Photolysis of an Archetypal Model Complex. Photooxidation Versus Photoreduction of Azido(porphinato)iron(III)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 54, September 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photolysis: The yield and product distribution of the photolysis of the archetypal azidoporphinatoiron(III) complex are examined by stationary and transient IR spectroscopy in conjunction with chemical quenching reactions with iodide and an isonitrile. The complex decomposes almost equally to the Fe(II) and the nitrido&#8208;Fe(V) product, with small absolute yields. Moreover, subsequent bimolecular reactions of the products are considered.







Abstract
Azidoporphinatoiron(III) ([1]) is an archetypal model complex for the photochemical generation of nitridoiron(V) complexes via cleavage of dinitrogen. So far, this process has only been studied with continuous irradiation in thin films under cryogenic conditions or in frozen solutions. In addition, the photooxidation from iron(III) to iron(V) competes with photoreduction to iron(II) via cleavage of an azidyl radical. The quantum yields of both pathways remained hitherto undisclosed. Here, we investigated the photolysis of this model complex in room temperature liquid solution using stationary and time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy. The two reaction pathways are unambiguously identified in quenching studies and their quantum yields are accurately determined. Nitridoporphinatoiron(V) ([2]) exhibits N&#8208;atom&#8208;2&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer reactivity toward tert&#8208;butyl isonitrile and forms a carbodiimido species. In the presence of tert&#8208;butyl isonitrile, the two products of the photoreduction pathway react to cationic diisonitriloporphinatoiron(III) and azide anions, which in turn combine to reform [1] and the quencher.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Coordination&#8208;Mediated H&#8208;Aggregates of Cyanine Dyes for Effective Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 54, September 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
H&#8208;aggregation behaviors of cyanine dyes induced by metal ions Fe2+ or Mn2+ for effective photothermal therapy have been studied. The ROS (O2&#8722;) generation efficiency varies depending on the extent of H&#8208;aggregates, which further affects their photothermal stability. Thus, the photothermal performance of Cy&#8208;3COOH/M NPs could be manipulated by the degree of H&#8208;aggregation.







Abstract
Integration of cyanine dyes and metal ions into one nanoplatform via metal&#8208;coordination interactions is an effective strategy to build multimodality phototheranostics. The multifunctionalities of the formed nanoscale metal&#8211;organic particles (NMOPs) have been widely explored. However, the effect of metal&#8208;coordination interaction on the aggregation behavior of cyanine dyes is rarely reported. Herein, we reported the H&#8208;aggregation behavior of cyanine dye Cy&#8208;3COOH induced by different metal ions M (Fe2+ or Mn2+). Moreover, the extent of H&#8208;aggregates varied with different metal&#8208;coordination interactions. Upon NIR irradiation, H&#8208;aggregates of Cy&#8208;3COOH remarkably promoted photothermal conversion efficiency. Interestingly, we also find that H&#8208;aggregates of Cy&#8208;3COOH induced by metal ions can generate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) involving singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide anion radical (O2&#8722;&#8901;) upon light irradiation. In addition, the ROS efficiency varies depending on the extent of H&#8208;aggregates. Additionally, the photoinduced ROS could disassemble aggregates and decompose cyanine dye Cy&#8208;3COOH, which limits the photothermal capability of Cy&#8208;3COOH/M NPs. Therefore, the photothermal performance of Cy&#8208;3COOH/M NPs could be manipulated by the degree of H&#8208;aggregation. This would provide a new insight to develop efficient phototheranostics NMOPs for cancer treatment.

         <dc:description>
This work applied Rh(III)&#8208;catalyst mediated substrate&#8208; and pH&#8208;controlled strategies to construct four novel types of complicated penta&#8208;spiro/fused&#8208;heterocyclic frameworks via C&#8722;H activation/[4+1] and [4+2] annulation cascades.







Abstract
Multiple&#8208;spiro/fused&#8208;heterocyclic frameworks containing indazolone are structurally unique and represent a class of potentially dominant skeletons. In this work, we successfully fulfilled Rh(III)&#8208;catalyst mediated substrate&#8208; and pH&#8208; controlled strategies to construct four novel types of complicated penta&#8208;spiro/fused&#8208;heterocyclic frameworks via C&#8722;H activation/[4+1] and [4+2] annulation cascades. This method had mild reaction conditions, a broad scope of substrates, moderate to good yields, and valuable applications, which could realize for the first time the generation of the novel di&#8208;spiro&#8208;heterocyclic and multiple fused&#8208;heterocyclic products with unique structures. More importantly, novel spiro[cyclohexane&#8208;indazolo[1,2&#8208;a]indazole] scaffold constructed by this method exhibited potent antitumor activity against a variety of refractory solid tumors and hematological malignancies in&#8197;vitro. Overall, our work provided new insights into the construction of complex and diverse multiple spiro/fused&#8208;heterocyclic systems and offered novel valuable lead compounds for the discovery of antitumor drugs.

         <dc:description>
A scalable and efficient method suitable for the preparation of a wide variety of ketones via new intermediate V has been developed.







Abstract
A new pathway via a cyclic intermediate for the synthesis of ketones from aldehydes and sulfonylhydrazone derivatives under basic conditions is proposed. Several control experiments were performed along with analysis of the mass spectra and in&#8208;situ IR spectra of the reaction mixture. Inspired by the new mechanism, an efficient and scalable method for homologation of aldehydes to ketones was developed. A wide variety of target ketones were obtained in yields of 42&#8211;95&#8201;% by simply heating the 3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)benzene sulfonylhydrazones (3&#8208;(Tfsyl)hydrazone) for 2&#8197;h at 110&#8201;&#176;C with aldehydes and with K2CO3 and DMSO as base and solvent, respectively.

         <title>Iso&#8208;Pentadienyl Carbonate as a Five Carbon Synthon in Manganese(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Linear 1,3&#8208;Dienylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 54, September 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A manganese(I)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H dienylation of arenes using iso&#8208;pentadienyl carbonate as five carbon synthons is reported. This is a highly unprecedented report for selective linear 1,3&#8208;dienylation by using C&#8722;H activation catalysis. Our method facilitates the synthesis of varieties of dienes, including those suitable for normal or inverse electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, dienyl glycoconjugates, and unnatural amino acids. Moreover, the synthetic applicability of this method eased to deliver a 6/6/5&#8208;fused tricyclic nagilactone scaffold.







Abstract

         <title>Photochemical [2+2] Cycloaddition of Alkynyl Boronates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 54, September 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition of alkynyl boronates and maleimides is described as a convenient method for the synthesis of polysubstituted borylated cyclobutenes tolerating a wide range of functional groups. Physicochemical and structural properties of the products obtained provide rationale for their application as phthalimide isosteric replacements, for example, in Thalidomide. Mechanistic studies confirm that the [2+2] cycloaddition proceeds through initial excitation of the maleimide component.







Abstract
A photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition of alkynyl boronates and maleimides is reported. The developed protocol provided 35&#8211;70&#8201;% yield of maleimide&#8208;derived cyclobutenyl boronates and demonstrated wide compatibility with various functional groups. The synthetic utility of the prepared building blocks was demonstrated for a range of transformations, including Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling, catalytic or metal&#8208;hydride reduction, oxidation, and cycloaddition reactions. With aryl&#8208;substituted alkynyl boronates, the products of double [2+2] cycloaddition were obtained predominantly. Using the developed protocol, a cyclobutene&#8208;derived analogue of Thalidomide was prepared in one step. Mechanistic studies supported the participation of the triplet&#8208;excited state maleimides and ground state alkynyl boronates in the key step of the process.

         <title>Merging Solid&#8208;Phase Peptide Synthesis and Automated Glycan Assembly to Prepare Lipid&#8208;Peptide&#8208;Glycan Chimeras</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 54, September 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipid&#8208;peptide&#8208;glycan chimeras are prepared in a stepwise&#8208;automated manner combing their solid&#8208;phase syntheses, as an alternative to classic late&#8208;stage conjugation. A variety of supramolecular structures are generated my merging peptide amphiphiles and lipids with oligosaccharides.







Abstract
Biomaterials with improved biological features can be obtained by conjugating glycans to nanostructured peptides. Creating peptide&#8208;glycan chimeras requires superb chemoselectivity. We expedite access to such chimeras by merging peptide and glycan solid&#8208;phase syntheses employing a bifunctional monosaccharide. The concept was explored in the context of the on&#8208;resin generation of a model &#945;(1&#8594;6)tetramannoside linked to peptides, lipids, steroids, and adamantane. Chimeras containing a &#946;(1&#8594;6)tetraglucoside and self&#8208;assembling peptides such as FF, FFKLVFF, and the amphiphile palmitoyl&#8208;VVVAAAKKK were prepared in a fully automated manner. The robust synthetic protocol requires a single purification step to obtain overall yields of about 20&#8201;%. The &#946;(1&#8594;6)tetraglucoside FFKLVFF chimera produces micelles rather than nanofibers formed by the peptide alone as judged by microscopy and circular dichroism. The peptide amphiphile&#8208;glycan chimera forms a disperse fiber network, creating opportunities for new glycan&#8208;based nanomaterials.

         <title>Investigations of the Photothermal Properties of a Series of Molecular Gold&#8208;bis(dithiolene) Complexes Absorbing in the NIR&#8208;III Region</title>

The photothermal properties of a series of hydrophobic gold&#8208;bis(dithiolene) absorbing in the NIR&#8208;III region were evaluated in organic solvents and in aqueous solution after encapsulation in polymer nanoparticles.







Abstract
The photothermal properties of a series of neutral radical gold&#8208;bis(dithiolene) complexes absorbing in the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;III window (1550&#8211;1870&#8197;nm) have been investigated. This class of complexes was found to be good photothermal agents (PTAs) in toluene under 1600&#8197;nm laser irradiation with photothermal efficiencies around 40 and 60&#8201;% depending on the nature of the dithiolene ligand. To the best of our knowledge, these complexes are the first small molecular photothermal agents to absorb so far into the near infrared. To test their applicability in water, these hydrophobic complexes have been encapsulated into nanoparticles constituted by amphiphilic block&#8208;copolymers. Stable suspensions of polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulating the gold&#8208;bis(dithiolene) complexes have been prepared which show a diameter around 100&#8197;nm. The encapsulation rate was found to be strongly dependent on the nature of the dithiolene ligands. The photothermal properties of the aqueous suspensions containing gold&#8208;bis(dithiolene) complexes were then studied under 1600&#8197;nm laser irradiation. These studies demonstrate that water has strong photothermal activity in the NIR&#8208;III region that, cannot be overcome even with the addition of gold complexes displaying good photothermal properties.

         <title>Factors Controlling Complex Morphologies of Isomorphous Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks

         <dc:description>
The unique double&#8208;decker flower morphology is combined with homochirality and single crystallinity. A series of isomorphous crystals have been demonstrated and the flower&#8208;like morphology originates from the &#8216;stellate&#8217; intermediate.







Abstract
We demonstrate here how nitrate salts of bivalent copper, nickel, cobalt, and manganese, along with an achiral organic ligand, assemble into various structures such as symmetrical double&#8208;decker flowers, smooth elongated hexagonal bipyramids, and hexagonal prisms. Large morphological changes occur in these structures because of different metal cations, although they maintain isomorphous hexagonal crystallographic structures. Metal cations with stronger coordination to ligands (Cu and Ni) tend to form uniform crystals with unusual shapes, whereas weaker coordinating metal cations (Mn and Co) produce crystals with more regular hexagonal morphologies. The unusual flower&#8208;like crystals formed with copper nitrate have two pairs of six symmetrical petals with hexagonal convex centers. The texture of the petals indicates dendritic growth. Two different types of morphologies were formed by using different copper nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratios. An excess of the metal salt results in uniform and hexagonal crystals having a narrow size distribution, whereas the use of an excess of ligand results in double&#8208;decker morphologies. Mechanistically, an intermediate structure was observed with slightly concave facets and a domed center. Such structures most likely play a key role in the formation of double&#8208;decker crystals that can be formed by fusion processes. The coordination chemistry results in isostructural chiral frameworks consisting of two types of continuous helical channels. Four pyridine units from four separate ligands are coordinated to the metal center in a plane having a chiral (propeller&#8208;type) arrangement. The individual double&#8208;decker flower crystals are homochiral and a batch consists of crystals having both handedness.

         <title>Multicomponent Reaction: Pd/Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Borocarbonylation of Aryldiazonium Salts with Aliphatic Terminal Alkynes to gem&#8208;Bis(boryl) Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 54, September 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convenient multicomponent procedure for the borocarbonylative synthesis of gem&#8208;bis(boryl) ketones has been developed. With aliphatic terminal alkynes, CO, aryldiazonium salts, and B2pin2 as the substrates, saturated &#946;&#8208;bis(boryl) ketones were isolated in moderate to good yields by using ethyl acetate as a proton source.







Abstract
We report the development of Pd/Cu&#8208;catalyzed selective 2,1&#8208;borocarbonylation reactions of aliphatic terminal alkynes with aryldiazonium salts and B2Pin2 to prepare gem&#8208;bis(boryl) ketones in one&#8208;pot. A series of corresponding products are obtained with good to excellent yields under a carbon monoxide atmosphere (10&#8197;bar). In addition, wide functional&#8208;group tolerance can be observed. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that ethyl acetate serves as a proton source in the reaction.

         <title>A Blueprint for the Stabilization of Sub&#8208;Valent Alkaline Earth Complexes

         <dc:description>
Group 2 metals are classically found in the +2 oxidation state and their sub&#8208;valent chemistry is hugely underdeveloped. Here we present a blueprint for a new approach towards the synthesis and stabilization of heavy Group 2 metals in the +1 oxidation state, based on the use of highly equatorial ligand environments (i.&#8201;e. trigonal planar, square planar). Our computational analysis highlights the potential role played by d&#8208;orbitals to access these species.







Abstract
The study of sub&#8208;valent Group 2 chemistry is a relatively new research field, being established in 2007 with the report of the first Mg(I) dimers. These species are stabilized by the formation of a Mg&#8722;Mg covalent bond; however, the extension of this chemistry to heavier alkaline earth (AE) metals has been frustrated by significant synthetic challenges, primarily associated with the instability of heavy AE&#8722;AE interactions. Here we present a new blueprint for the stabilization of heavy AE(I) complexes, based upon the reduction of AE(II) precursors with planar coordination geometries. We report the synthesis and structural characterisation of homoleptic trigonal planar AE(II) complexes of the monodentate amides {N(SiMe3)2}&#8722; and {N(Mes)(SiMe3)}&#8722;. DFT calculations showed that the LUMOs of these complexes all show some d&#8208;character for AE = Ca&#8722;Ba. DFT analysis of the square planar Sr(II) complex [Sr{N(SiMe3)2}(dioxane)2]&#8734; revealed analogous frontier orbital d&#8208;character. AE(I) complexes that could be accessed by reduction of these AE(II) precursors were modelled computationally, revealing exergonic formation in all cases. Crucially, NBO calculations show that some d&#8208;character is preserved in the SOMO of theoretical AE(I) products upon reduction, showing that d&#8208;orbitals could play a crucial role in achieving stable heavy AE(I) complexes.

         <title>[3+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition Reactions of gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropenes with Azomethine Ylides &#8211; Access to Novel Fluorinated Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 54, September 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient synthetic routes to series of difluorinated 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes are presented exploiting the cycloaddition of difluorocyclopropene and different azomethine ylides. Products containing the difluorinated 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane core along with a Z&#8208;configured vinyl fluoride are obtained when reacting proline esters with difluorocyclopropenes in a solvent&#8208;free thermal process.







Abstract
The introduction of fluorinated moieties into drugs as well as the increase of their overall three&#8208;dimensionality have become key strategies amongst medicinal chemists to generate sets of compounds with favorable drug&#8208;like properties. However, the introduction of fluorinated cyclopropane ring systems which combines both strategies is not widely exploited to date. This paper reports synthetic strategies exploiting the reactivity of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropenes in dipolar cycloaddition reactions with azomethine ylides to afford sets of new fluorine&#8208;containing 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes. In addition, the unexpected formation of complex trifluorinated scaffolds arising from proline esters and gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropenes is highlighted along with computational studies to elucidate the underlying mechanism. This study presents new avenues towards pharmaceutically relevant fluorinated 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes that are accessible via robust and short synthetic sequences.

         <title>Anchoring Polydopamine on ZnCo2O4 Nanowire To Facilitate Urea Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 54, September 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The core&#8208;shell structure ZnCo2O4@polydopamine (PDA) has been developed over nickel foam by a facile method to create an electrode with a hierarchical structure. The deposition of PDA enhances electrical conductivity by generating more active sites for efficient oxidation reactions, and can thus play a crucial role in the urea oxidation reaction. The electrode exhibits an excellent urea oxidation potential of 80&#8197;mV&#8201;vs. RHE at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 &#8211; less than that of water electrolysis &#8211; and shows excellent stability with no destruction in the developed core&#8208;shell structure.







Abstract
To overcome the sluggishness of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the urea oxidation reaction was developed. In the case of OER application studies ZnCo2O4 is an excellent electrocatalyst, towards the UOR has been performed with surface&#8208;grown polydopamine (PDA) with surface&#8208;grown polydopamine (PDA). ZnCo2O4@PDA is produced over the surface of nickel foam by a hydrothermal method followed by self&#8208;polymerization of dopamine hydrochloride. Dopamine hydrochloride was varied in solution to study the optimal growth of PDA necessary to enhance the electrochemical activity. Prepared ZnCo2O4@PDA was characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction, electronic structural, and morphology/microstructure studies. With successful confirmation, the developed electrode material was applied to UOR and ZnCo2O4@PDA&#8208;1.5, delivering an excellent low overpotential of 80&#8197;mV at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the electrolyte mixture of 1&#8197;M potassium hydroxide+0.33&#8197;M urea. To support the excellent UOR activity, other electrochemical properties such as the Tafel slope, electrochemical surface active sites, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were also studied. Furthermore, a schematic illustration explaining the UOR mechanism is shown to allow a clear understanding of the obtained electrochemical activity. Finally, urea water electrolysis was carried out in a two&#8208;electrode symmetrical cell and compared with water electrolysis. This clearly showed the potential of the developed material for efficient electrochemical hydrogen production.

Due to their unique electronic properties, the low&#8208;coordinate heavier main&#8208;group element species display high reactivity toward inert small molecules. Transient 2H&#8208;phosphinidole working as reactive phosphadiene undergoes phospha&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with a wide range of non&#8208;activated aromatic carbocycles and heterocycles, providing simple but straightforward access to a range of polycyclic fused rings feature with bridgehead phosphorus.







Abstract
The heavier main group multiple bonds offer an effective tool for small molecule activation. Transient 2H&#8208;phosphinidole working as a reactive phosphadiene system undergoes phospha&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with a wide range of non&#8208;activated aromatic carbocycles and heterocycles, including naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, furan, thiophene, pyrrole, pyridine, and benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles, affording concise access to a range of polycyclic fused rings feature with phosphorus at the bridgehead. These results demonstrate that non&#8208;activated (hetero)arenes are capable of acting as 2&#960; systems in [4+2] cycloaddition with highly reactive 2H&#8208;phosphindole complex.

         <title>Sequential Water Sorption/Desorption of a Nonporous Adaptive Organic Ligand Bridged Coordination Polymer for Atmospheric Moisture Harvesting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 54, September 26, 2023. </description>

A nonporous anionic coordination polymer of uranyl squarate with methyl viologen as charge balancing ions that displays sequential water sorption/desorption has shown its potential in application for atmospheric water harvesting.







Abstract
Moisture harvesters with favourable attributes such as easy synthetic availability and good processability as alternatives for atmospheric moisture harvesting (AWH) are desirable. This study reports a novel nonporous anionic coordination polymer (CP) of uranyl squarate with methyl viologen (MV2+) as charge balancing ions (named U&#8208;Squ&#8208;CP) which displays intriguing sequential water sorption/desorption behavior as the relative humidity (RH) changes gradually. The evaluation of AWH performance of U&#8208;Squ&#8208;CP shows that it can absorb water vapor under air atmosphere at a low RH of 20&#8201;% typical of the levels found in most dry regions of the world, and have good cycling durability, thus demonstrating the capability as a potential moisture harvester for AWH. To the authors&#8217; knowledge, this is the first report on non&#8208;porous organic ligand bridged CP materials for AWH. Moreover, a stepwise water&#8208;filling mechanism for the water sorption/desorption process is deciphered by comprehensive characterizations combining single&#8208;crystal diffraction, which provides a reasonable explanation for the special moisture harvesting behaviour of this non&#8208;porous crystalline material.

         <title>Stereo&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of Vicinal Tertiary Carbinols: Application in the Synthesis of a Diol Substructure of Zaragozic Acid, Pactamycin and Ryanodol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 54, September 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general approach for the stereoselective synthesis of vicinal tertiary carbinols has been developed. This strategy featured stereoselective O21 [4+2] cycloaddition of designed cyclohexadienones followed by O&#8722;O and C&#8722;C bond cleavage. A versatile synthetic intermediate was prepared on practical scale as a potential precursor to a wide variety of vicinal tertiary carbinol containing compounds. Application of the developed strategy enabled entry to the highly advanced core structures of zaragozic acid, pactamycin and ryanodol.







Abstract
A novel and flexible approach for the stereo&#8208;controlled synthesis of vicinal tertiary carbinols is reported. The developed strategy featured a highly diastereoselective singlet&#8208;oxygen (O21) [4+2] cycloaddition of rationally designed cyclohexadienones (derived from oxidative dearomatization of the corresponding carboxylic&#8208;acid appended phenol precursors), followed by programmed &#8220;O&#8722;O&#8221; and &#8220;C&#8722;C&#8221; bond cleavage. In doing so, a highly functionalized and versatile intermediate was identified and prepared in synthetically useful quantity as a plausible precursor to access a variety of designed and naturally occurring vicinal tertiary carbinol containing compounds. Most notably, the developed strategy was successfully applied in the stereo&#8208;controlled synthesis of advanced core structures of zaragozic acid, pactamycin and ryanodol.

         <title>Tetra&#8208;Face&#8208;Capped Octahedra in a Tetrahedra Network &#8211; Structure Determination and Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy of SrAl5P4N10O2F3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 54, September 26, 2023. </description>

SrAl5P4N10O2F3 was synthesized using a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature reaction. Atomic&#8208;resolution EDX mapping with scanning transmission electron microscopy confirms the cation site assignment. Ten Al3+&#8208;centered octahedra form a condensed (Al(N,O,F)6)10 unit that is a novel structure motif in network compounds. Eu2+&#8208;doped SrAl5P4N10O2F3 shows blue emission when irradiated with UV light.







Abstract
Tetrahedra&#8208;based nitridophosphates show a rich structural chemistry, which can be further extended by incorporating cations in higher coordinated positions, for example, in octahedral voids or by substituting the nitrogen atoms in the network with other anions. Following this approach, SrAl5P4N10O2F3 was synthesized at high&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;pressure conditions using a multianvil press (1400&#8201;&#176;C, 5&#8197;GPa) starting from Sr(N3)2, c&#8208;PON, P3N5, AlN, and NH4F. SrAl5P4N10O2F3 crystallizes in space group 
 with a=11.1685(2) and c=7.84850(10) &#197;. Atomic&#8208;resolution EDX mapping with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) indicates atom assignments, which are further corroborated by bond&#8208;valence sum (BVS) calculations. Ten Al3+&#8208;centered octahedra form a highly condensed tetra&#8208;face&#8208;capped octahedra&#8208;based unit that is a novel structure motif in network compounds. A network of vertex&#8208;sharing PN4 tetrahedra and chains of face&#8208;sharing Sr2+&#8208;centered cuboctahedra complement the structure. Eu2+&#8208;doped SrAl5P4N10O2F3 shows blue emission (&#955;em=469&#8197;nm, fwhm=98&#8197;nm; 4504&#8197;cm&#8722;1) when irradiated with UV light.

Organosilicon reagent N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(trimethylsilyl)&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridinylidene (Si&#8208;DHBP) served as an efficient reductant in the transformation, enabling the in&#8197;situ generation of aryl nitrene species for the synthesis of 2&#8208;arylindolines from the corresponding nitroarene compounds.







Abstract
Given the prevalence of molecules containing nitro groups in organic synthesis, innovative methods to expand the reactivity of this functional group are of interest in both industrial and academic settings. In this report, a metal&#8208;free intramolecular benzylic sp3 C&#8722;H amination is disclosed using aryl nitro compounds as aryl nitrene precursors. Organosilicon reagent N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(trimethylsilyl)&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridinylidene (Si&#8208;DHBP) served as an efficient reductant in the transformation, enabling the in&#8197;situ generation of aryl nitrene species for the direct, metal&#8208;free synthesis of unprotected 2&#8208;arylindolines from the corresponding nitroarene compounds.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework&#8208;Supported Metallocene for Ethylene Polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 54, September 26, 2023. </description>

A more polished polyethylene: Covalent organic framework (COF) particles with hydroxy groups and well&#8208;defined micropores were synthesized and used as a novel carrier to load metallocene. The resulting supported catalyst, with a high specific surface area, demonstrated higher catalytic activity and better thermal tolerance during ethylene polymerization. It produced polyethylene with a higher molecular weight, increased crystallinity, and highly improved mechanical properties.







Abstract
The loading of homogeneous catalysts with support can dramatically improve their performance in olefin polymerization. However, the challenge lies in the development of supported catalysts with well&#8208;defined pore structures and good compatibility to achieve high catalytic activity and product performance. Herein, we report the use of an emergent class of porous material&#8212;covalent organic framework material (COF) as a carrier to support metallocene catalyst&#8212;Cp2ZrCl2 for ethylene polymerization. The COF&#8208;supported catalyst demonstrates a higher catalytic activity of 31.1&#215;106&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 140&#8201;&#176;C, compared with 11.2&#215;106&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for the homogenous one. The resulting polyethylene (PE) products possess higher weight&#8208;average molecular weight (Mw) and narrower molecular weight distribution (&#208;) after COF supporting, that is, Mw increases from 160 to 308&#8197;kDa and &#208; drops from 3.3 to 2.2. The melting point (Tm) is also increased by up to 5.2&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, the PE product possesses a characteristic filamentous microstructure and demonstrates an increased tensile strength from 19.0 to 30.7&#8197;MPa and elongation at break from 350 to 1400&#8201;% after catalyst loading. We believe that the use of COF carriers will facilitate the future development of supported catalysts for highly efficient olefin polymerization and high&#8208;performance polyolefins.

Covalent organic framework (COF) particles with hydroxy groups and well&#8208;defined micropores have been synthesized and used as novel carriers to load a metallocene catalyst&#8212;Cp2ZrCl2. The resulting supported catalyst, which had a high specific surface area, demonstrated higher catalytic activity, better thermal tolerance, and a unique nanoconfinment effect during ethylene polymerization, producing polyethylene with a higher molecular weight, increased crystallinity, and highly improved mechanical performance.

In the realm of chemical synthesis, a child envisioned an adventurous journey of manganese(I) catalysis full of obstacles, like the distant howls of wolves echoing through the night, with the ultimate goal of finding a general route to discover a linear, selective C&#8722;H dienylation method that leads to electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor dienes, glycoconjugates, and unnatural amino acids. The synthetic application of this method is also eased to deliver the tricyclic core of Nagilactone. More information can be found in the Research Article by P. Subramanian and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301632).

         <title>Design and Synthesis of New Type of Macrocyclic Architectures Used for Optoelectronic Materials and Supramolecular Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 54, September 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various macrocyclic architectures, ranging from the carbon&#8208;based macrocycles to the emerging heteroatom&#8208;doped macrocycles, have recently been established. This Minireview briefly overviews the latest advances in the design principle of macrocyclic systems as well as their applications in optoelectronic devices, supramolecular assembly and host&#8208;guest recognition.







Abstract
Supramolecular chemistry has received much attention for decades. Macrocyclic architectures as representative receptors play a vital role in supramolecular chemistry and are applied in many fields such as supramolecular assembly and host&#8208;guest recognition. However, the classical macrocycles generally lack functional groups in the scaffolds, which limit their further applications, especially in optoelectronic materials. Therefore, developing a new design principle is not only essential to better understand macrocyclic chemistry and the supramolecular behaviors, but also further expand their applications in many research fields. In recent years, the doping compounds with main&#8208;group heteroatoms (B, N, S, O, P) into the carbon&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocycles offered a new strategy to build macrocyclic architectures with unique optoelectronic properties. In particular, the energy gaps and redox behavior can be effectively tuned by incorporating heteroatoms into the macrocyclic scaffolds. In this Minireview, we briefly summarize the design and synthesis of new macrocycles, and further discuss the related applications in optoelectronic materials and supramolecular chemistry.

         <dc:description>New developments in the field of Lewis acidity are highlighted, with the focus of novel Lewis acids and Lewis superacids of group 2, 13, 14, and 15 elements. Several important basics, illustrated by modern examples (classification of Donor&#8208;Acceptor (DA) complexes, amphoteric nature of any compound in terms of DA interactions, reorganization energies of main group Lewis acids and the role of the energies of frontier orbitals) are presented and discussed. It is emphasized that the Lewis acidity phenomena are general and play vital role in different areas of chemistry: from weak &#8220;atomophilic&#8221; interactions to the complexes of Lewis superacids.</dc:description>

         <title>Collective Synthesis of Sarpagine and Macroline Alkaloid&#8208;Inspired Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Design strategies that can access natural product&#8208;like chemical space in an efficient manner may facilitate the discovery of biologically relevant compounds. We have employed a divergent intermediate strategy to construct an indole&#8208;alkaloid inspired compound collection derived from two different molecular design principles, i.e. biology&#8208;oriented synthesis and pseudo&#8208;natural products. The divergent intermediate was subjected to acid&#8208;catalyzed or newly discovered Sn&#8208;mediated conditions to selectively promote intramolecular C&#8208; or N&#8208;acylation, respectively. After further derivatization, a collection totalling 84 compounds representing four classes was obtained. Morphological profiling via the cell painting assay coupled with a subprofile analysis showed that compounds derived from different design principles have different bioactivity profiles. The subprofile analysis suggested that a pseudo&#8208;natural product class is enriched in modulators of tubulin, and subsequent assays led to the identification of compounds that supress in vitro tubulin polymerization and mitotic progression.</dc:description>

         <title>Gas&#8208;Phase Alkali&#8208;Metal Cation Affinities of Stabilized Enolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemistry of alkali&#8208;metal enolates is dominated by ion pairing. To improve our understanding of the intrinsic interactions between the alkali&#8208;metal cations and the enolate anions, we have applied Cooks&#8217; kinetic method to determine relative M+ (M = Li, Na, K) affinities of the stabilized enolates derived from acetylacetone, ethyl acetoacetate, diethyl malonate, ethyl cyanoacetate, 2&#8209;cyanoacetamide, and methyl malonate monoamide in the gas phase. Quantum chemical calculations support the experimental results and moreover afford insight into the structures of the alkali&#8208;metal enolate complexes. The affinities decrease with increasing size of the alkali&#8208;metal cations, reflecting weaker electrostatic interactions and lower charge densities of the free M+ ions. For the different enolates, a comparison of their coordinating abilities is complicated by the fact that some of the free anions undergo conformational changes resulting in stabilizing intramolecular interactions. If these complicating effects are disregarded, the M+ affinities correlate with the electron density of the chelating functionalities, i.e., the carbonyl and/or the nitrile groups of the enolates. A comparison with the known association constants of the corresponding alkali&#8208;metal enolates in solution points to the importance of solvation effects for these systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Differentiating between Label and Protein Conformers in Pulsed Dipolar EPR Spectroscopy with the dHis&#8208;Cu2+(NTA) Motif</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pulsed Dipolar EPR Spectroscopy (PDS) in combination with site&#8208;directed spin labeling is a powerful tool in structural biology. However, the commonly used spin labels are conjugated to biomolecules via&#160;flexible linkers, which hampers the translation of distance distributions into biomolecular conformations. In contrast, the spin label (nitrilotriacetic acid)copper(II) [Cu2+(NTA)] bound to two histidines (dHis) is rigid and can be more easily translated into biomolecular conformations. Here, we use this label on the 71 kDa Yersinia outer protein O (YopO) to decipher whether a previously experimentally observed bimodal distance distribution is due to two conformations of the biomolecule or of the flexible spin labels. Two different PDS experiments, i.e., Pulsed Electron&#8208;Electron Double Resonance (PELDOR aka DEER) and Relaxation Induced Dipolar Modulation Enhancement (RIDME), yield unimodal distance distribution with the dHis&#8208;Cu2+(NTA) motif, suggesting that the&#160;&#945;&#8208;helical backbone of YopO adopts a single conformation in frozen solution. In addition, we show that the Cu2+(NTA)&#8208;label preferentially binds to the target double Histidine (dHis) sites even in the presence of 22 competing native histidine residues. This suggests that the generation of a His&#8208;null background is not required for this spin labeling methodology. Together these results highlight the value of the dHis&#8208;Cu2+(NTA) motif in PDS experiments.</dc:description>

Two different PDS experiments, i.e., Pulsed Electron-Electron Double Resonance (PELDOR aka DEER) and Relaxation Induced Dipolar Modulation Enhancement (RIDME), yield unimodal distance distribution with the dHis-Cu2+(NTA) motif, suggesting that the&#160;&#945;-helical backbone of YopO adopts a single conformation in frozen solution. In addition, we show that the Cu2+(NTA)-label preferentially binds to the target double Histidine (dHis) sites even in the presence of 22 competing native histidine residues. This suggests that the generation of a His-null background is not required for this spin labeling methodology. Together these results highlight the value of the dHis-Cu2+(NTA) motif in PDS experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Prediction of strong solvatochromism in a molecular photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Based on quantum chemical calculations, we predict strong solvatochromism in a light&#8208;driven molecular photocatalyst for hydrogen generation, i.e., we show that the electronic and optical properties of the photocatalyst strongly depend on the solvent it is dissolved in. Our calculations in particular indicate a solvent dependent relocation of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Ground&#8208;state density functional theory and linear response time dependent density functional theory calculations are applied in order to investigate the influence of implicit solvents on the structural, electronic and optical properties of a molecular photocatalyst. Only at high dielectric constants of the solvent, the HOMO is located at the metal center of the photosensitizer, whereas at low dielectric constants the HOMO is centered at the metal atom of the catalytically active complex. We elucidate the electronic origins of this strong solvatochromic effect and sketch the consequences of these insights for the use of photocatalysts in different environments.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since Cu2+ ions play a pivotal role in both ecosystems and human health, the development of a rapid and sensitive method for Cu2+ detection holds significant importance. Fluorescent mesoporous silica materials (FMSMs) have garnered considerable attention in the realm of chemical sensing, biosensing, and bioimaging due to their distinctive structure and easily functionalized surfaces. As a result, numerous Cu2+ sensors based on FMSMs have been devised and extensively applied in environmental and biological Cu2+ detection over the past few decades. This review centers on the recent advancements in the methodologies for preparing FMSMs, the mechanisms underlying sensing, and the applications of FMSMs&#8208;based sensors for Cu2+ detection. Lastly, we present and elucidate pertinent perspectives concerning FMSMs&#8208;based Cu2+ sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrene C&#8211;H Bond Insertion Approach to Carbazolones and Indolones, and a Reactivity Departure for 7&#8208;Membered Analogues.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A modular platform for facile access to 1,2,3,9&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;4H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;4&#8208;ones (H4&#8208;carbazolones) and&#160;3,4&#8208;dihydrocyclopenta[b]indol&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones (H2&#8208;indolones)&#160;is described. The requisite 6&#8208; and 5&#8208;membered 2&#8208;arylcycloalkane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione precursors were readily obtained through a Cu&#8208;catalyzed arylation of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexanediones or by a ring expansion of aryl succinoin derivatives. Enolization of one carbonyl group in the diones, conversion to a leaving group, and subsequent azidation gave 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;azidocycloalk&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ones. This two&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot azidation is highly regioselective with unsymmetrically substituted 2&#8208;arylcyclohexane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones.&#160;&#160;The regioselectivity, which is important for access to single isomers of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted carbazolones, was analyzed mechanistically and computationally. Finally, a Rh&#8208;catalyzed nitrene/nitrenoid insertion into the&#160;ortho&#160;C&#8211;H bond of the aryl moiety gave the H&#173;4&#8208;carbazolones and H2&#8208;indolones. One carbazolone was elaborated to an intermediate reported in the total synthesis of&#160;N&#8208;decarbomethoxychanofruticosinate, (&#8211;)&#8208;aspidospermidine, (+)&#8208;kopsihainanine A. With 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;cycloheptanedione, prepared from cyclohexanone and benzaldehyde, the azidation reaction was readily accomplished. However, the Rh&#8208;catalyzed reaction unexpectedly led to a labile but characterizable azirine rather than the indole derivative. Computations were performed to understand the differences in reactivities of the 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;azidocycloalk&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ones in comparison to the 7&#8208;membered analogue, and to support the structural assignment of the azirine.</dc:description>

         <title>Underwater Adhesives from Redox&#8208;responsive Polyplexes of Thiolated Polyamide Polyelectrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the fabrication of optically clear underwater adhesives using polyplexes of oppositely charged partially&#8208;thiolated polyamide polyelectrolytes (TPEs). The thiol content of the constituent PEs was varied to assess its influence on the adhesive properties of the resulting glues. These catechol&#8208;free, redox&#8208;responsive TPE&#8208;adhesives were formulated in aquo and exhibited high optical transparency and strong adhesion even on submerged or moist surfaces of diverse polar substrates such as glass, aluminium, wood, and bone pieces. The adhesives could be cured under water through oxidative disulphide crosslinking of the constituent TPEs. The polyamide backbone provided multi&#8208;site H&#8208;bonding interactions with the substrates while the disulphide crosslinking provided the cohesive strength to the glue. Strong adhesion of mammalian bones (load bearing capacity upto 7 kg/cm2) was achieved using the adhesive containing 30 mol% thiol residues. Higher pH and use of oxidants such as povidone&#8208;iodine solution enhanced the curing rate of the adhesives, and so did the use of Tris buffer instead of Phosphate buffer.&#160;The porous architecture of the adhesive and its progressive degradation in aqueous medium over the course of three weeks bode well for diverse biomedical applications where temporary adhesion of tissues is required.</dc:description>

         <title>A Three&#8208;Dimensional (3D) Framework of Freestanding Vanadium Nitride Nanowires&#160;for Dendrite&#8208;Free&#160;and Long Life&#8208;span Lithium Metal Anodes</title>

         <dc:description>Lithium (Li) metal is a promising anode candidate for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries owing to its high theoretical capacity and&#160;low&#160;electrochemical potential. However, uneven Li nucleation, uncontrollable&#160;dendritic growth, infinite voltage change&#160;and even safety issues hinder its commercial application. Herein, a&#160;three&#8208;dimensional&#160;(3D) framework of freestanding vanadium nitride nanowires (VN NWs) is established as Li host for dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anode. A lithiophilic Li3N interlayer&#160;which&#160;in&#8208;situ&#160;formed by the surface reaction between molten Li and VN NWs is utilized to guide&#160;a uniform Li nucleation and deposition within the skeleton, as well as avoid the dendrite formation.&#160;Meanwhile, VN NWs can&#160;decrease&#160;local current density, homogenize Li&#8208;ion &#64258;ux&#160;and accommodate volume fluctuations of the anode&#160;due to its 3D structure with high electron conductivity. Thus, the corresponding composite Li metal anode&#160;delivers&#160;a long&#8208;life span of 500 cycles (1000 hrs) at a current density of 0.5 mA cm&#8208;2, and exhibits lower nucleation&#160;over&#8208;potential&#160;and voltage hysteresis&#160;at&#160;different current densities from 0.5~5 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;in carbonate electrolyte.&#160;In conclusion, this work provides a new type&#160;of&#160;scaffold with both high electronic conductivity and excellent lithiophilicity for stable Li anodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactive Reductive Species Participating Photodynamic Therapy for Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the development of oxidative photodynamic therapy (O&#8208;PDT) based on reactive oxygen species (ROS) has made great progress for cancer treatment, tumor hypoxia, cellular adaptation and intrinsic antioxidant defenses are still obstacles at this stage. Fortunately, with the discovery and development of reactive reductive species (RRS) in the PDT process, reductive PDT (R&#8208;PDT) receives increasing research interests. The R&#8208;PDT featuring oxygen&#8208;independence is effective by reduction therapy, which promises that it still has excellent therapeutic efficacy in extremely hypoxic or even anaerobic environment. In the concept, we introduce representative strategies to boost the Type I photosensitizing pathway, and then focus on the most recent R&#8208;PDT involving hydrogen radical (H&#8226;) and single electron transfer (SET) process.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Photochromic Properties of Diaryl [5]Helicene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoinduced tuning of aromaticity and correlative molecular properties has attracted enormous interest in recent years for both modulating photochromism properties and designing novel photochromic materials. Here, we report on the synthesis and photochemical characterizations investigation of diaryl[5]helicene based diarylethene molecular switches. 3,4&#8208;Bis(2,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenylthiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)dibenzo[c,g]phenanthrene derivative 1a showed no photochromic reaction, while 3,4&#8208;bis(2&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenylthiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)dibenzo[c,g]phenanthrene derivative 2a and 3,4&#8208;bis(5&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenylthiazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)dibenzo[c,g]phenanthrene derivative 3a exhibited reversible photochromism in different aprotic solvents with specific light irradiation. Meanwhile, the diarylethene compounds 2a and 3a underwent turn&#8208;off mode fluorescence photoswitchings together with the photoisomerization reaction upon light irradiation. Remarkably, the photoinduced changes in aromaticity of [5]helicene as a central ethene bridge along with the relative smaller activation energy and higher frequency factor facilitated the thermal bleaching rates of diarylethene switches 2 and 3 in solution. This research provides a new insight for designing aromatic diarylethene photoswitches for reversible fluorescence switching behaviour, photoinduced changes in aromaticity and further fast thermal back reaction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Hierarchical combinations involving metal&#8210;ligand interactions and host&#8210;guest interactions can consolidate building blocks with unique functions into material properties. Herein, we reported the construction and hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of multifunctional trinuclear AuI tricarbene complex containing three crown ether units and three ferrocene units. In addition, we investigated the host&#8210;guest interactions between multifunctional trinuclear AuI tricarbene complex and organic ammonium salts, revealing crown ether&#8208;based host&#8210;guest interactions can effectively regulate the electrochemical properties of the complex. Utilizing bisammonium salt as the cross&#8208;linker and multifunctional trinuclear AuI tricarbene complex as the core, we successfully obtained a stimuli&#8208;responsive and self&#8208;healing supramolecular gel with different functional units.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescence Enhancement of Adamantane&#8208;Modified Dyes in Aqueous Solution via Supramolecular Interaction with Methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin and Their Application in Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fluorescence of functional dyes was generally quenched in aqueous solution, which hindered their application in water&#8208;bearing detections. In this work, a novel strategy based on host&#8208;guest interaction was provided for the purpose of fluorescence enhancement in aqueous solution and cell imaging. Three adamantane&#8208;modified fluorescent dyes (Coum&#8208;Ad, NP&#8208;Ad, NR&#8208;Ad) with coumarin, 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide and Nile Red as fluorophores were initially designed and prepared. The ((adamantan&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methyl)amino group, as the auxochrome of these dyes, complexed with methylated &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD) via supramolecular interaction, and then fluorescent supramolecular nanoparticles (FSNPs) were formed by self&#8208;assembly in water. The inclusion equilibrium constant (K) could be as high as 3.94&#215;104 M&#8208;1. With the addition of M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD, fluorescence quantum yields of these dyes were separately improved to 69.8%, 32.9% and 41.3%. Inspired by the above satisfactory results, six adamantane&#8208;modified probes organelle&#8208;NPAds with organelle&#8208;targeting capability were further obtained. As the formation of hydrogen bonds between organelle&#8208;NPAd2 and M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD verified by theoretical calculation, K of organelle&#8208;NPAd2 (5.13&#215;104 M&#8208;1 ~ 4.53&#215;105 M&#8208;1) with M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD was higher than that of organelle&#8208;NPAd1 (1.15&#215;104 M&#8208;1 ~ 3.66&#215;104 M&#8208;1) and their fluorescence quantum yields increased to 32.8% ~ 83.6% in aqueous solution. In addition, fluorescence enhancement was realized in cell imaging with the addition of M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving the Reverse Intersystem Crossing in Chalcone based Donor&#8208;Acceptor System through Down&#8208;Conversion of Triplet Exciton</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, understanding the mechanism of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) has become the primary choice for designing high&#8208;efficiency, low&#8208;cost, metal&#8208;free organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). Herein, we propose a strategically designed chalcone based donor&#8208;acceptor system, where intensification of delayed fluorescence with decrease in temperature (300K to 100K) is observed; the theoretical investigations of electronic states and orbital characters uncovered a new cold rISC pathway in donor&#8208;acceptor system, where rISC occurs through the down&#8208;conversation of higher triplet exciton (from T3) to lowest singlet state (S1), having negative energy splitting, thus no thermal energy is required. The comprehensive research described herein might open&#8208;up new avenues in donor&#8208;acceptor system over the conventional up&#8208;convention of triplet exciton and demonstrates that not necessarily all delayed fluorescence are thermally activated (TADF).</dc:description>

         <title>Neutral Silylyne Complex of Molybdenum: Synthesis, Properties, and Access to Silaiminoacyl Complexes via [2+3] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A neutral silylyne complex of molybdenum was synthesized by the stepwise dehydrogenation method and its properties were compared with those of the tungsten analog. The complex takes a dimeric form as crystals but afford a monomer&#8208;dimer equilibrium in solution. The replacement of the central metal from W to Mo led to a monomer dominant (~98%) solution at room temperature. The monomer&#8208;dimer dynamics was investigated based on thermodynamic parameters. The molybdenum silylyne complex underwent [2+2] cycloaddition with alkynes much faster than the tungsten analog. The reactions with organic azides led to the formation of the first example of silaiminoacyl complexes through [2+3] cycloaddition. The structure and bonding aspects of the products were clarified by multiple measurements and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Chasing Turns and Twists: Unraveling the One&#8208;Step Synthesis, Intricate Pathways, and Structural Revelations of N&#8208;Aryl Aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the efficient one&#8208;step synthesis of N&#8208;Aryl aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulenes starting from bis(biaryl)carbazoles. The intermediacy of N&#8208;aryl aza[7]helicene is investigated, and the Scholl oxidative cyclization route is invoked here to overcome the large strain during the formation of N&#8208;aryl aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulenes from N&#8208;aryl aza[7]helicene. Notably, this transformation occurs without the need for directing groups and proceeds from a more helical to a less helical pathway. Both the N&#8208;aryl aza[7]helicene and N&#8208;aryl aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulene are confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis. The enantiomers of N&#8208;aryl aza[7]helicene are separated by chiral HPLC and analyzed by circular dichroism spectroscopy to investigate their chiroptical properties. However, N&#8208;aryl aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulene racemizes rapidly. The radical cations generated from aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulene through chemical oxidation exhibit broad absorption in the near&#8208;IR region and air stability up to 24 h. Optical and electrochemical studies with helicene and quasicirculene derivatives highlight their potential in organic electronic devices.</dc:description>

The radical cations generated from aza-quasi[8]circulene through chemical oxidation exhibit broad absorption in the near-IR region and air stability up to 24 h. Optical and electrochemical studies with helicene and quasicirculene derivatives highlight their potential in organic electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chalcogen Bond Catalysis with Telluronium Cations for Bromination Reaction: Importance of Electrostatic and Polarization Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, chalcogen bond catalysts&#160;with telluronium cations have garnered considerable attention in organic reactions. In this work, chalcogen bond catalysis on the bromination reaction of anisole with N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS) with the telluronium cationic catalysts has been explored with density functional theory (DFT). The catalytic reaction is divided into two stages: the bromine transfer step and the proton transfer step. Based on the computational results, one can find the rate&#8208;determining step is the bromine transfer step. Moreover, the present study elucidates that a stronger chalcogen bond (ChB) between catalysts and NBS will give better catalytic performance. Additionally, this work also clarified the importance of the electrostatic and polarization effects in the chalcogen bond between the oxygen atom of NBS and the Te atom of the catalyst in this bromination reaction. The electrostatic and polarization effects are significantly influenced by the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the substitution groups on the catalysts. Moreover, the structure&#8208;property relationship between the strength of ChB bond, electrostatic effect, polarization effect and catalytic performance are established for the designation of more efficient chalcogen bond catalysts.</dc:description>

Intersystem crossing: FRET (40.4&#8197;ps) and CS (1.55&#8197;ns) were observed, upper 3BDP* was populated by charge recombination, followed by the slow intramolecular TTET (14.5&#8197;&#956;s), which generates 3PBI* state, the triplet state formed via the RP ISC shows an unusual ESP phase pattern of (e, e, e, e, e, e), which is a rare example of S&#8208;T+1/T0 states mixing in the RP ISC mechanism.







Abstract
Bodipy (BDP)&#8208;perylenebisimide (PBI) donor&#8211;acceptor dyads/triad were prepared to study the spin&#8211;orbit charge&#8208;transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC). For BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;3, in which BDP was attached at the imide position of PBI, higher singlet oxygen quantum yield (&#934;&#916;=85&#8201;%) was observed than the bay&#8208;substituted derivative BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;1 (&#934;&#916;=30&#8201;%). Femtosecond transient absorption spectra indicate slow F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET; 40.4&#8197;ps) and charge separation (CS; 1.55&#8197;ns) in BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;3, while for BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;1, CS takes 2.8&#8197;ps. For triad BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;2, ultrafast FRET (149&#8197;fs) and CS (4.7&#8197;ps) process were observed, the subsequent charge recombination (CR) takes 5.8&#8197;ns and long&#8208;lived 3PBI* (179.8&#8197;&#956;s) state is populated. Nanosecond transient absorption spectra of BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;3 show that the CR gives upper triplet excited state (3BDP*) and subsequently, via a slow intramolecular triplet energy transfer (14.5&#8197;&#956;s), the 3PBI* state is finally populated, indicating that upper triplet state is involved in SOCT&#8208;ISC. Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that both radical pair ISC (RP ISC) and SOCT&#8208;ISC contribute to the ISC. A rare electron spin polarization of (e, e, e, e, e, e) was observed for the triplet state formed via the RP ISC mechanism, due to the S&#8722;T+1/T0 states mixing.

         <title>Spatially Resolved Chiroptical Spectroscopies Emphasizing Recent Applications to Thin Films of Chiral Organic Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical and up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview is given on spatially resolved chiroptical spectroscopies, which represent a promising tool for mapping and disentangling local supramolecular structures in thin films of chiral organic dyes.







Abstract
Instrumental techniques able to identify and structurally characterize the aggregation states in thin films of chiral organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials, from the first&#8208;order supramolecular arrangement up to the microscopic and mesoscopic scale, are very helpful for clarifying structure&#8208;property relationships. Chiroptical imaging is currently gaining a central role, for its ability of mapping local supramolecular structures in thin films. The present review gives an overview of electronic circular dichroism imaging (ECDi), circularly polarized luminescence imaging (CPLi), and vibrational circular dichroism imaging (VCDi), with a focus on their applications on thin films of chiral organic dyes as case studies.

Dancing hybridization: The first example of efficient and stereoselective (E)&#8208;1,3&#8208;enyne synthesis exclusively from alkene substrates is described.

Abstract
The involvement of nitroalkenes instead of minimal one alkyne motif for (E)&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes synthesis through a palladium catalyzed stereoselective bond forming pathway at room temperature is presented. Implication of nitro group as a sacrificial directing group, formation of magical alkyne on a newly developed Csp3&#8208;Csp3 bond with initial palladium&#8208;MBH adduct make this methodology distinctive. This protocol features an unprecedented sequential acetate addition, carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation, isomerization of double bond and nitromethane degradation in a tandem catalytic walk via dancing hybridization. Mechanistic understanding through identification of intermediates and computational calculations furnishes complete insight into the tandem catalytic pathway. Broad substrates scope and functional groups tolerance make this synthetic methodology magnificent and dynamic. This represents the first example of stereoselective 1,3&#8208;enyne synthesis exclusively from alkene substrates by introducing the concept of sacrificial directing group.

&lt;p&gt;The involvement of nitroalkenes instead of minimal one alkyne motif for (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-1,3-enynes synthesis through a palladium catalyzed stereoselective bond forming pathway at room temperature is presented. Implication of nitro group as a sacrificial directing group, formation of magical alkyne on a newly developed C&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; bond with initial palladium-MBH adduct make this methodology distinctive. This protocol features an unprecedented sequential acetate addition, carbon-carbon bond formation, isomerization of double bond and nitromethane degradation in a tandem catalytic walk via dancing hybridization. Mechanistic understanding through identification of intermediates and computational calculations furnishes complete insight into the tandem catalytic pathway. Broad substrates scope and functional groups tolerance make this synthetic methodology magnificent and dynamic. This represents the first example of stereoselective 1,3-enyne synthesis exclusively from alkene substrates by introducing the concept of sacrificial directing group.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploring the Potential of Anthraquinone&#8208;Based Hybrids for Identifying a Novel Generation of Antagonists for the Smoothened Receptor in HH&#8208;Dependent Tumour</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design principle is provided for the preparation of a first and second generation of anthraquinone&#8208;based hybrids by combining the rhein scaffold with variously substituted piperazine nuclei structurally similar to the active portion of known inhibitors of SMO, the main transducer of the HH pathway.







Abstract
Natural products (NPs) are highly profitable pharmacological tools due to their chemical diversity and ability to modulate biological systems. Accessing new chemical entities while retaining the biological relevance of natural chemotypes is a fundamental goal in the design of novel bioactive compounds. Notably, NPs have played a crucial role in understanding Hedgehog (HH) signalling and its pharmacological modulation in anticancer therapy. However, HH antagonists developed so far have shown several limitations, thus growing interest in the design of second&#8208;generation HH inhibitors. Through smart manipulation of the NPs core&#8208;scaffold, unprecedented and intriguing architectures have been achieved following different design strategies. This study reports the rational design and synthesis of a first and second generation of anthraquinone&#8208;based hybrids by combining the rhein scaffold with variously substituted piperazine nuclei that are structurally similar to the active portion of known SMO antagonists, the main transducer of the HH pathway. A thorough functional and biological investigation identified RH2_2 and RH2_6 rhein&#8208;based hybrids as valuable candidates for HH inhibition through SMO antagonism, with the consequent suppression of HH&#8208;dependent tumour growth. These findings also corroborated the successful application of the NPs&#8208;based hybrid design strategy in the development of novel NP&#8208;based SMO antagonists.

         <title>Disulfide&#8208;Driven Pore Functionalization of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy for metal&#8211;organic frameworks is presented. Diverse functional groups are installed within an analogue of MIL&#8208;53(Al) via disulfide bonds.







Abstract
Post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) imparts additional functionality to metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) that is often difficult to access using solvothermal synthesis. As such, expanding the repertory of PSM reactions available to the practitioner is of increased importance for the generation of materials tailored for desired applications. Herein, a method is described for the protecting group&#8208;free installation of diverse functional groups within the pores of a MIL&#8208;53(Al) analogue via disulfide bond formation. The majority of the reactions proceed with thiol&#8208;to&#8208;disulfide conversions ranging from high to nearly quantitative. The disulfide bonds are stable in various solvents and can be cleaved in the presence of a reducing agent.

         <title>Electroactive Dyes Based on 1,8&#8208;Naphthalimide with Acetylene Linkers as Promising OLED Materials &#8211; the Relationship Between Structure and Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Appropriate communication is the key to success: four new 1,8&#8208;napthalimide derivatives of acceptor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor type were obtained and thoroughly investigated, paying special attention to photophysical properties. The key element of the structures are the ethynyl linkers, thanks to which perfect &#960;&#8208;electron communication between aromaric building blocks is possible. These luminescence, highly efficient emitters were tested in SM&#8208;OLEDs&#8217; prototypes (DEV1&#8208;DEV4).







Abstract
Four A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type small organic molecules with 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide motifs were successfully synthesised. The designed compounds are built of two 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide units linked via ethynyl &#960;&#8208;linkages with selected functionalised donor motifs i.&#8201;e. 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bithiophene, fluorene, phenothiazine and carbazole derivative. The synthesis based on Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling allowed us to obtain the presented dyes with good yields. The resulting symmetrical small molecules&#8217; optical, electrochemical and thermal properties were thoroughly investigated, and their potential applicability for the OLED devices was demonstrated. In addition, the relationship between molecular structure and properties was considered by employing experimental and theoretical studies. As a result of using various donor groups, it was possible to achieve efficient electroluminescence in the range from green (DEV4) to orange&#8208;red light (DEV3) with a maximum luminance of 3 820&#8197;cd/m2 for DEV4. Upon the insertion of an acetylene linker to the designed molecules, the free rotation of D and A fragments, and hence the effective &#960;&#8208;electron communication within the entire molecule, is possible, which was confirmed by DFT studies. The obtained dyes are characterised by high thermal stability, reversible oxidation&#8208;reduction process, satisfactory optoelectronic properties and good solubility in organic solvents, which is advisable for the application in small molecular organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (SM&#8208;OLEDs) technology.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Hetero&#8208;Pnictogen Diazonium Analogs Stabilized by Transition Metal Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of the mixed dipnictogen complexes [{CpMo(CO)2}2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;PE)] (E=P, As, Sb) with carbon&#8208; and tin&#8208;based electrophiles led to the formation of novel [EPR]+ chains stabilized by two [CpMo(CO)2] units, which can formally be considered as heavier diazonium homologs. Reactivity studies on these unique entities with different NHCs showed the formation of novel, asymmetrically substituted diphosphenes.







Abstract
The reactivity of the mixed dipnictogen complexes [{CpMo(CO)2}2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;PE)] (E=P, As, Sb) towards different group&#8197;14 electrophiles is reported. The resulting library of cationic compounds [{CpMo(CO)2}2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;EPR)]+ (R=Mes (2,4,6&#8208;C6H2Me3), CH3, CPh3, SnMe3) represents formally inorganic diazonium homologs which are stabilized by transition metal units. Modifying the steric and electronic properties of the electrophile drastically impacts the respective P&#8722;R bond lengths and is accompanied by increasing (SnMe3&gt;CPh3&gt;CH3) dynamic behavior in solution. In contrast to the well&#8208;studied organic analogs, the prepared compounds are stable at room temperature. The subsequent reaction of the model substrate [{CpMo(CO)2}2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;P2Me)][OTf] ([OTf]&#8722;=[CF3SO3]&#8722;) with different N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) leads to an addition at the unsubstituted P atom which is also predicted by computational methods. NMR spectroscopy confirms the formation of two isomers sync/gauche&#8208;[{CpMo(CO)2}(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;P(NHC)PMe){CpMo(CO)2}][OTf]. X&#8208;ray crystallographic characterization and additional DFT calculations shed light on the spatial arrangement as well as on the possible formation pathways of the isomers.

         <title>Functional Molecular Crystals from the Arylation of a Halogenoplatinum Complex: Stimuli Responsiveness, Comproportionation, and &#960;&#8208;Bridged Dimerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An arylplatinum complex that shows polymorph&#8208;dependent emission, mechano&#8208; and thermochromic luminescence, as well as comproportionation and &#960;&#8208;bridged dimerization is reported. Simple mixing of this complex with a structurally similar arylplatinum complex in solution at room temperature resulted in transfer of their aryl groups (comproportionation); this allows their mechanochromic profiles to be tuned. Recrystallization of the complex afforded a dimerized product in which two platinum ions are bridged by aryl groups resulting in a very short (3.0466(10) &#197;) Pt&#8722;Pt distance.







Abstract
A chloroplatinum complex was arylated to obtain stimuli&#8208;responsive molecular crystals. The resulting arylplatinum complex showed polymorph&#8208;dependent emission, mechano&#8208; and thermochromic luminescence as well as comproportionation and &#960;&#8208;bridged dimerization. Simple mixing of structurally similar arylplatinum complexes at room temperature resulted in the transfer of their aryl groups (comproportionation), which allowed their mechanochromic profiles to be tuned. We also found that recrystallization of the complex afforded a dimerized product in which two platinum ions are bridged by aryl groups resulting in a very short (3.0466(10) &#197;) Pt&#8722;Pt distance.

         <title>Determination of the Handedness of Urea Inclusion Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To establish the correlation between the optical rotation and the absolute structure of urea inclusion compounds (UICs), three pairs of enantiomorphic UICs were studied. This successful experimental elucidation of the handedness of UICs not only settled a question that has lasted half a century, but also showcased the feasibility of absolute structure determination by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD).







Abstract
Since the discovery of urea inclusion compounds (UICs) in 1940, the handedness of this chiral helical system has not been established experimentally. Here three UIC systems containing only light atoms were studied. The optical rotations were first measured, and the absolute structures of the enantiomorphic domains of three UICs were determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD). The correlation between the optical rotation and the absolute configuration of the UICs was finally established, showcasing the power of absolute structure determination by SCXRD, which is essential in structural chemistry and pharmaceutical research.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding Catalysis: Tellurium, the Last Frontier?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>: Chalcogen bonding (ChB) is the non&#8208;covalent interaction occurring between chalcogen atoms as Lewis acid sites and atoms or groups of atoms able to behave as Lewis bases through their lone pair or p electrons. Analogously to its sister halogen bonding, the high directionality of this interaction was implemented for the precise structural organization in the solid state and in solution. Regarding catalysis, ChB is now accepted as a new mode of activation as demonstrated by the increased number of examples in the last five years. In the family of ChB catalysts, those based on tellurium rapidly appeared to overcome their lighter sulfur and selenium counterparts. In this review, we highlight the Lewis acid properties of tellurium&#8208;based derivatives in solution and summarize the start&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of their applications in catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding properties of small electrophilic anions [B6X5]&#8722; and [B10X9]&#8722; (X = Cl, Br, I): Activation of small molecules based on &#960;&#8208;backbonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Superelectrophilic anions constitute a special class of molecular anions, which show strong binding of weak nucleophiles despite their negative charge. In this study, the binding characteristics of smaller gaseous electrophilic anions of the types [B6X5]&#8722; and [B10X9]&#8722; (with X = Cl, Br, I) are computationally and experimentally investigated and compared to those of the larger analogues [B12X11]&#8722;. The positive charge of vacant boron increases from [B6X5]&#8722; via [B10X9]&#8722; to [B12X11]&#8722;, as evidenced by increasing attachment enthalpies towards typical &#963;&#8208;donor molecules (noble gases, H2O). However, this behavior is reversed for &#963;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor molecules. [B6Cl5]&#8722; binds strongest to N2 and CO, even stronger than to H2O. Energy decomposition analysis confirms that the orbital interaction is responsible for this opposite trend. The extended transition state&#8208;natural orbitals for chemical valence method shows that the &#960;&#8208;backdonation order is [B6X5]&#8722; &gt; [B10X9]&#8722; &gt; [B12X11]&#8722;. This predicted order explains the experimentally observed red shifts of the CO and N2 stretching fundamentals compared to those of the unbound molecules measured by infrared photodissociation spectroscopy. The strongest red shift is observed for [B6Cl5N2]&#8722;: 222 cm&#8208;1. Therefore, strong activation of unreactive &#963;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor molecules (commonly observed for cationic transition metal complexes) is achieved with metal&#8208;free molecular anions.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation and Growth of Atomic Scale Seeds of Au Nanoparticle in the Nanospace of an Organic Cage Molecule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Seed&#8208;mediated growth has been widely used to synthesize noble metal nanoparticles with controlled size and shape. Although it is becoming possible to directly observe the nucleation process of metal atoms at the single atom level by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), it is challenging to control the formation and growth of seeds with only a few metal atoms in homogeneous solution systems. Herein, we report site&#8208;selective formation and growth of atomic scale seeds of the Au nanoparticle in a nanospace of an organic cage molecule. We synthesized a cage molecule with amines and phenols, which were found to both capture and reduce Au(III) ions to spontaneously form the atomic scale seeds containing Au(0) in the nanospace. The growth reaction of the atomic scale seeds afforded Au nanoparticles with an average diameter of 2.0 &#177; 0.2 nm, which is in good agreement with the inner diameter of the cage molecule.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Step Synthesis of NiI from NiII with H2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemists have long sought to regulate the reactivity of H2, to yield hydride ions, hydrogen atoms, or electrons on demand. One source of inspiration for achieving this control is [NiFe]hydrogenase ([NiFe]H2ase), which reacts with H2 to form various hydrogen active species such as NiIII hydride species, NiII hydride species, and NiI low&#8208;valent species. Chemists have attempted to synthesize these hydrogen active species not only as models for the active species of [NiFe]H2ase, but also as electron transfer catalysts. However, the synthesis of NiI complex directly from H2 has not been reported. This paper reports the first example of a single&#8208;step synthesis of a NiI complex, via reaction of a NiII complex with H2, stable for over 3 months at room temperature and we further demonstrate a reductive coupling of acridinium ions as part of a reaction cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimization Study of a NODA Derivative&#160;Radiofluorination by Al18F Complexation Using a Design of Experiments Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine&#8208;18 (18F) is the most favorable positron emitter for radiolabeling Positron Emission Tomography (PET) probes. However, conventional 18F labeling through covalent C&#8208;F bond formation is challenging, involving multiple steps and stringent conditions unsuitable for sensitive biomolecular probes whose integrity may be altered. Over the past decade, an elegant new approach has been developed involving the coordination of an aluminum fluoride {Al18F} species in aqueous media at a late&#8208;stage of the synthetic process. The objective of this study was to implement this method and to optimize radiolabeling efficiency using a Design of Experiments (DoE). To assess the impact of various experimental parameters on {Al18F} incorporation, a pentadentate chelating agent NODA&#8208;MP&#8208;C4 was prepared as a model compound. This model carried a thiourea function present in the final conjugates resulting from the grafting of the chelating agent onto the probe. The formation of the radioactive complex Al18F&#8208;NODA&#8208;MP&#8208;C4 was studied to achieve the highest radiochemical conversion. A complementary "cold" series study using the natural isotope 19F was also conducted to guide the radiochemical operating conditions. Ultimately, Al18F&#8208;NODA&#8208;MP&#8208;C4 was obtained with a reproducible and satisfactory radiochemical conversion of 79 &#177; 3.5% (n = 5).</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Bioluminescence of &#8216;V&#8217;&#8208;Shaped Firefly Luciferin Analogues Based on A Novel Benzobisthiazole Core.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of p&#8208;extended conjugation &#8216;V&#8216;&#8208;shaped red shifted bioluminescent D&#8208;luciferin analogues based on a novel benzobisthiazole core is described. The divergent synthetic route allowed access to a range of amine donor substituents through an SNAr reaction. In spectroscopic studies, the &#8216;V&#8216;&#8208;shaped luciferins exhibited narrower optical band gaps, more red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission spectra than D&#8208;luciferin. Their bioluminescence characteristics were recorded against four different luciferases (PpyLuc, FlucRed, CBR2 and PLR3). With native luciferase PpyLuc, the &#8216;V&#8216;&#8208;shaped luciferins demonstrated more red&#8208;shifted emissions than D&#8208;luciferin (&#955;bl = 561 nm) by 60 to 80 nm. In addition, the benzobisthiazole luciferins showed a wide range of bioluminescence spectra from the visible light region (&#955;bl = 500 nm) to the nIR window (&gt; 650 nm). The computational results validate the design concept which can be used as a guide for further novel D&#8208;luciferin analogues based upon other &#8216;V&#8216;&#8208;shaped heterocyclic cores.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen Bonding in Brominated BODIPY Crystals: a Crystallographic and Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study of halogen bonds (XBs) has been a subject of great interest in recent years due to its clear application in catalysis, liquid crystals, and crystal engineering. In this study we analyzed the intermolecular interactions, in particular halogen bonds in BODIPYs with increasing number of bromine atoms. The computational study included analyses through three different methods: the first approach of close contacts provided by Mercury, then the expanded approach of the electron density partition of the molecules in the crystals provided by the analysis of Hirshfeld surfaces, and finally, the approach of the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QT&#8208;AIM) to characterize the non&#8208;covalent interactions through finding electron density critical points between atoms and between neighboring molecules. The use of different computational methods allowed to gain insight on the interactions directing the crystal packing as the number of bromine atoms increase in the BODIPY moiety. Monocoordinated and bifurcated halogen bonds involving halide/halide were found. The penta&#8208;brominated BODIPY showed four&#8208;center cyclic nodes where each node is linked via XBs. This kind of motifs can be useful in supramolecular chemistry and self&#8208;assembly.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During the investigation of the binary system Be&#8211;Ru two new phases &#8208; Be7Ru4 and Be12Ru7 &#8208; with similar compositions (63.6 at. % Be and 63.2 at. % Be, respectively), are discovered. They both represent new structural prototypes. The phases are located between Be2Ru (Fe2P&#8208;type structure) and Be3Ru2 (U3Si2&#8208;type structure) in the phase diagram. This explains why their crystal structures, solved and refined from single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data, are described as 2D intergrowth of Fe2P and U3Si2 motives. The calculated electronic density of stats (DOS) reveals pronounced minima in the vicinity of the Fermi level for both compounds. Position&#8208;space analysis of chemical bonding exhibits the formation of three&#8208; and four&#8208;atomic polar bonds, involving both, Ru and Be, atoms, and a strong charge transfer from Be to the more electronegative Ru.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon nanostructures (CNSs) are attractive components to attain nanocomposites, yet their hydrophobic nature and strong tendency to aggregate often limit their use in aqueous conditions and negatively impact their properties. In this work, carbon nanohorns (CNHs), multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), and graphene (G) are first oxidized, and then reacted to covalently anchor the self&#8208;assembling tripeptide L&#8208;Leu&#8208;D&#8208;Phe&#8208;D&#8208;Phe to improve their dispersibility in phosphate buffer, and favor the formation of hydrogels formed by the self&#8208;organizing L&#8208;Leu&#8208;D&#8208;Phe&#8208;D&#8208;Phe present in solution. The obtained nanocomposites are then characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), oscillatory rheology, and conductivity measurements to gain useful insights as to the key factors that determine self&#8208;healing ability for the future design of this type of nanocomposites.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Electron Transfer in Multi&#8208;Redox Systems Based on Cyclic [3]Spirobifluorenylene Compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic [3]spirobifluorenylene with bulky alkyl groups at the ends (1) was designed and synthesized to investigate the electron transfer phenomena in a &#960;&#8208;conjugated system including orthogonal &#960;&#8208;conjugated chains. The three bifluorenyl units in 1 are conjugated to each other via spiro&#8208;conjugation, resulting in the splitting of the HOMO levels to a small extent. Therefore, the SOMO&#8211;HOMO gap of the radical cation species is small, which is considered to allow the facile intramolecular electron transfer. In the TD&#8208;DFT calculations for the radical cation species of 1, the geometry&#8208;featured interchain electronic transitions were visualized by NTO calculations. The radical cation species of 1 generated by chemical oxidation with SbCl5 exhibited a broadened and lower&#8208;energy shifted NIR absorption band compared to those of its partial structures. Considering the results of the TD&#8208;DFT calculations, the NIR band of the radical cation of 1 was attributed to the intramolecular electron transfer processes among the bifluorenyl units in the macrocycle. ESR experiments also indicated the delocalization of a spin of 1&#183;+ in the whole molecule via hole hopping in the ESR time scale at room temperature. This work demonstrates the usefulness of spiro&#8208;conjugation as a bridging unit in molecular wires to facilitate smooth electron transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photo&#8208;degradable Crosslinker for the Development of Light&#8208;responsive Protocell Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photocleavable, poly(ethylene) glycol&#8208;based crosslinker, reactive to biological nucleophiles is synthesized and used to covalently stabilise proteinosome membranes. The crosslinker effectively degrades on irradiation with UV light, allowing for the photopatterning of populations of proteinosomes using a 405&#8197;nm laser, and for the controlled formation of membrane pores and the consequent controlled release of macromolecular cargoes based on their molecular weight.







Abstract
The achievement of light&#8208;responsive behaviours is an important target for protocell engineering to allow control of fundamental protocellular processes such as communication via diffusible chemical signals, shape changes or even motility at the flick of a switch. As a step towards this ambitious goal, here we describe the synthesis of a novel poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;based crosslinker, reactive towards nucleophiles, that effectively degrades with UV light (405&#8197;nm). We demonstrate its utility for the fabrication of the first protocell membranes capable of light&#8208;induced disassembly, for the photo&#8208;generation of patterns of protocells, and for the modulation of protocell membrane permeability. Overall, our results not only open up new avenues towards the engineering of spatially organised, communicating networks of protocells, and of micro&#8208;compartmentalised systems for information storage and release, but also have important implications for other research fields such as drug delivery and soft materials chemistry.

         <title>Ru(II)&#8208;Cyanine Complexes as Promising Photodynamic Photosensitizers for the Treatment of Hypoxic Tumours with Highly Penetrating 770&#8197;nm Near&#8208;Infrared Light</title>

A novel class of Ruthenium(II) complexes that can be photoactivated at 770&#8197;nm under hypoxic conditions thanks to the incorporation of a heptamethine cyanine dye is described.







Abstract
Light&#8208;activated treatments, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT), provide temporal and spatial control over a specific cytotoxic response by exploiting toxicity differences between irradiated and dark conditions. In this work, a novel strategy for developing near infrared (NIR)&#8208;activatable Ru(II) polypyridyl&#8208;based photosensitizers (PSs) was successfully developed through the incorporation of symmetric heptamethine cyanine dyes in the metal complex via a phenanthrimidazole ligand. Owing to their strong absorption in the NIR region, the PSs could be efficiently photoactivated with highly penetrating NIR light (770&#8197;nm), leading to high photocytotoxicities towards several cancer cell lines under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Notably, our lead PS (Ru&#8208;Cyn&#8208;1), which accumulated in the mitochondria, exhibited a good photocytotoxic activity under challenging low&#8208;oxygen concentration (2&#8201;% O2) upon NIR light irradiation conditions (770&#8197;nm), owing to a combination of type I and II PDT mechanisms. The fact that the PS Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), the metabolite of the clinically approved 5&#8208;ALA PS, was found inactive under the same challenging conditions positions Ru&#8208;Cyn&#8208;1 complex as a promising PDT agent for the treatment of deep&#8208;seated hypoxic tumours.

         <title>Bridging the Gap between Zeolites and Dense Silica Polymorphs: Formation of All&#8208;Silica Zeolite with High Framework Density from Natural Layered Silicate Magadiite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Between zeolite and silica: A silica zeolite RWZ&#8208;1 with a very high framework density (FD) was synthesized through topotactic condensation of natural layered silicate magadiite. Based on the viewpoint of its FD and thermal expansion behavior, RWZ&#8208;1 is regarded as a truly intermediate silica material between zeolites and dense silica polymorphs, which can be applicable as a unique catalyst and adsorbent.







Abstract
A silica zeolite (RWZ&#8208;1) with a very high framework density (FD) was synthesized from highly crystalline natural layered silicate magadiite, bridging the gap between the two research areas of zeolites and dense silica polymorphs. Magadiite was topotactically converted into a 3D framework through two&#8208;step heat treatment. The resulting structure had a 1D micropore system of channel&#8208;like cavities with an FD of 22.1 Si atoms/1000&#8197;&#197;3. This value is higher than those of all other silica zeolites reported so far, approaching those of silica polymorphs (tridymite (22.6) and &#945;&#8208;quartz (26.5)). RWZ&#8208;1 is a slight negative thermal expansion material with thermal properties approaching those of dense silica polymorphs. It contributes to the creation of a new field on microporous high&#8208;density silica/silicates. Synergistic interactions are expected between the micropores with molecular sieving properties and the dense layer&#8208;like building units with different topologies which provide thermal and mechanical stabilities.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Between zeolite and silica&lt;/b&gt;: A silica zeolite RWZ-1 with a very high framework density (FD) was synthesized through topotactic condensation of natural layered silicate magadiite. Based on the viewpoint of its FD and thermal expansion behavior, RWZ-1 is regarded as a truly intermediate silica material between zeolites and dense silica polymorphs, which can be applicable as a unique catalyst and adsorbent.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A silica zeolite (RWZ-1) with a very high framework density (FD) was synthesized from highly crystalline natural layered silicate magadiite, bridging the gap between the two research areas of zeolites and dense silica polymorphs. Magadiite was topotactically converted into a 3D framework through two-step heat treatment. The resulting structure had a 1D micropore system of channel-like cavities with an FD of 22.1 Si atoms/1000&#8197;&#197;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. This value is higher than those of all other silica zeolites reported so far, approaching those of silica polymorphs (tridymite (22.6) and &#945;-quartz (26.5)). RWZ-1 is a slight negative thermal expansion material with thermal properties approaching those of dense silica polymorphs. It contributes to the creation of a new field on microporous high-density silica/silicates. Synergistic interactions are expected between the micropores with molecular sieving properties and the dense layer-like building units with different topologies which provide thermal and mechanical stabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible Light and Triselenium Dicyanide (TSD): New Horizons in the Synthesis of Organic Selenocyanates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ingenious method for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl selenocyanates and &#945;&#8208;hydroxy selenocyanates is to simply react triselenium dicyanide and styrenes (or alkenes) under blue light irradiation and O2. Additionally, &#945;&#8208;carbonyl selenocyanates were explored as a synthetic platform in a multicomponent process to prepare 2&#8208;phenylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives, which were investigated for their photophysical properties.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a new method for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl selenocyanates by reacting triselenium dicyanide (TSD) and styrenes under blue light irradiation and O2 atmosphere. The reactions are triggered by the formation of Se&#8208;centered radical species, followed by the addition/oxidation of the styrene &#960;&#8208;bond. &#945;&#8208;Carbonyl selenocyanates and &#945;&#8208;hydroxy selenocyanates were obtained in moderate to excellent yields from aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted alkenes, respectively. It was demonstrated that &#945;&#8208;carbonyl selenocyanates could be used as a synthetic platform in a multicomponent reaction strategy to prepare 2&#8208;phenylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives, which were evaluated for their photophysical properties. Overall, this new method provides a useful tool for synthesizing &#945;&#8208;carbonyl selenocyanates, and demonstrates their potential for use in the synthesis of other compounds, thus giving new synthetic opportunities to construct organic selenocyanate compounds.

         <title>Reduced Tiara&#8208;like Palladium Complex for Suzuki Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes the development of a highly active and reusable palladium&#8208;based catalyst on alumina (Pd8/Al2O3) derived from an octanuclear tiara&#8208;like palladium complex and exploited for Suzuki coupling reactions. The high specific activity of the catalyst allowed to complete the coupling reaction in 30&#8197;min using only 0.12&#8197;mol&#8201;% Pd loading under very mild and green reaction conditions.







Abstract
The design of highly active and structurally well&#8208;defined catalysts has become a crucial issue for heterogeneous catalysed reactions while reducing the amount of catalyst employed. Beside conventional synthetic routes, the employment of polynuclear transition metal complexes as catalysts or catalyst precursors has progressively intercepted a growing interest. These well&#8208;defined species promise to deliver catalytic systems where a strict control on the nuclearity allows to improve the catalytic performance while reducing the active phase loading. This study describes the development of a highly active and reusable palladium&#8208;based catalyst on alumina (Pd8/Al2O3) for Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reactions. An octanuclear tiara&#8208;like palladium complex was selected as active phase precursor to give isolated Pd&#8208;clusters of ca. 1&#8197;nm in size on Al2O3. The catalyst was thoroughly characterised by several complementary techniques to assess its structural and chemical nature. The high specific activity of the catalyst has allowed to carry out the cross&#8208;coupling reaction in 30&#8197;min using only 0.12&#8197;mol&#8201;% of Pd loading under very mild and green reaction conditions. Screening of various substrates and selectivity tests, combined with recycling and benchmarking experiments, have been used to highlight the great potentialities of this new Pd8/Al2O3 catalyst.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Aminocarbonylation with Isocyanates Through Weak Coordinating Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under mild conditions: A redox&#8208;neutral and base&#8208;free protocol for the directed ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H aminocarbonylation is developed through high&#8208;throughput experimentation. The mild conditions allowed the introduction of privileged amide moieties to a wide range of anilides bearing various substitution patterns and different weakly Lewis basic directing groups.







Abstract
Introducing amide functional groups under mild conditions has growing importance owing to the prevalence of such moiety in biologically active molecules. Herein, we disclose a mild protocol for the directed ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H aminocarbonylation with isocyanates as the amidating agents developed through high&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE). The redox&#8208;neutral and base&#8208;free reaction is guided by weakly Lewis basic functional groups, including anilides, lactams and carbamates to access anthranilamide derivatives. The synthetic utility of this transformation is reflected by large&#8208;scale synthesis and late&#8208;stage functionalization.

         <title>Highly Electrophilic Intermediates in the Bypass Mechanism of Glutathione Peroxidase: Synthesis, Reactivity, and Structures of Selenocysteine&#8208;Derived Cyclic Selenenyl Amides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selenocysteine (Sec)&#8208;derived cyclic selenenyl amides, formed by the intramolecular cyclization of Sec selenenic acids (Sec&#8211;SeOHs), have been postulated to function as protective forms in the bypass mechanism of glutathione peroxidase (GPx). However, their chemical properties have not been experimentally elucidated in proteins or small&#8208;molecule systems. Recently, we reported the first nuclear magnetic resonance observation of Sec&#8211;SeOHs and their cyclization to the corresponding cyclic selenenyl amides using selenopeptide model systems incorporated in a molecular cradle. Herein, we elucidate the structures and reactivities of Sec&#8208;derived cyclic selenenyl amides. The crystal structures and reactions toward a cysteine thiol or a 1,3&#8208;diketone&#8208;type chemical probe indicated the highly electrophilic character of cyclic selenenyl amides. This suggests that they can serve not only as protective forms to suppress the&#160;inactivation&#160;of Sec&#8211;SeOHs in GPx&#160;but also&#160;as highly electrophilic intermediates in the reactions of selenoproteins.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Chimeras as Electrochemical Biosensors for Host&#8208;Guest Measurements in Blood</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Few sensing platforms have become ubiquitous to enable rapid and convenient measurements at the point&#8208;of&#8208;care. Those, however, are &#8220;one&#8208;off&#8221; technologies, meaning that they can only detect a single target and are hardly adaptable. In response, we plan to develop a sensing platform that can be extended to detect other classes of molecules and that affords rapid, convenient, continuous measurements directly in undiluted complex matrices. For this, we decided to rely on a host molecule that presents reversible interactions toward specific guest molecules to develop a new class of sensors that we coined &#8220;Electrochemical DNA&#8208;host chimeras&#8221;. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for our sensor, we decided to use cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene) (&#8220;blue box&#8221;) that we attached on an electrode&#8208;bound DNA to allow measurements of electron&#8208;rich guests such as dopamine and aspirin. Doing so allows to promote host&#8208;guest complex that could be quantified using blue box&#8217;s electrochemistry. Because of this unique sensor architecture, we achieve, to our knowledge, the first reagentless, continuous and rapid (&lt; 5 min) host&#8208;guest measurements in undiluted whole blood. We envision that given the library of electroactive host molecules that this will allow the development of a sensing platform for measurements of several classes of molecules in complex matrices at the point&#8208;of&#8208;care.</dc:description>

         <title>Control and transferability of magnetic interactions in supramolecular structures: trimers of {Cr7Ni}&#160;antiferromagnetic rings.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate here a synthetic strategy to prepare two distinct trimers of antiferromagnetically coupled {Cr7Ni} rings, substantially varying the magnetic interactions between the spin centres. The interactions were studied using multi&#8208;frequency cw EPR: in a trimer linked via non&#8208;covalent H&#8208;bonding interactions no measurable interaction between rings was seen, while in a trimer linked via iso&#8208;nicotinate groups isotropic and anisotropic exchange interactions of +0.42 and &#8208;0.8 GHz, respectively, were observed. The latter are the same as those for a simpler hetero&#8208;dimer system, showing how the spin&#8208;spin interactions can be built in a predictable and modular manner in these systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent C&#8208;H Olefination of Imidazo[1,2a]Pyridine Carboxamide and Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite remarkable successes in linear and branched vinyl (hetero) arene synthesis, regiodivergent C&#8208;H olefination with a single catalytic system has remained underdeveloped. Overcoming this limitation, herein, we report Pd/MPAA mediated regiodivergent olefination protocol of imidazo[1,2a] pyridine carboxamide and unactivated alkenes to generate branched and linear olefinated products depending upon the electronic nature of alkenes. Moreover, this protocol can be applied for C&#8208;H deuteriation of the corresponding heteroarenes with D2O as deuterium source. Preliminary experimental studies combined with computational investigations (DFT studies) suggest that regiodivergent olefination can be controlled by olefin insertion and b&#8208;hydride elimination steps.</dc:description>

         <title>Modern Potentiometric Biosensing Based on Non&#8208;equilibrium Measurement Techniques</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modern potentiometric sensors based on polymeric membrane ion&#8208;selective electrodes (ISEs) have achieved new breakthroughs in sensitivity, selectivity, and stability and extended applications in environmental surveillance, medical diagnostics, and industrial analysis. Moreover, nonclassical potentiometry shows promise for many applications and opens up new opportunities for potentiometric biosensing. Here, we aim to provide a concept to summarize advances over the past decade in the development of potentiometric biosensors with polymeric membrane ISEs. This concept articulates sensing mechanisms based on non&#8208;equilibrium measurement techniques. In particular, we emphasize new trends in potentiometric biosensing based on attractive dynamic approaches. Representative examples are selected to illustrate key applications under zero&#8208;current conditions and stimulus&#8208;controlled modes. More importantly, fruitful information obtained from non&#8208;equilibrium measurements with dynamic responses can be useful for artificial intelligence (AI). The combination of ISEs with advanced AI techniques for effective data processing is also discussed. We hope that the concept will illustrate the great possibilities offered by non&#8208;equilibrium measurement techniques and AI in potentiometric biosensing and encourage further innovations in this exciting field.</dc:description>

         <title>Isocyanides as Catalytic Electron Acceptors in the Visible Light Promoted Oxidative Formation of Benzyl and Acyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic isocyanides are able to harvest visible light and promote the oxidative formation of both alkyl and acyl radicals starting from Hantzsch esters, potassium alkyltrifluoroborates, and &#945;&#8208;oxoacids. UV&#8208;visible absorption and fluorescence experiments, electrochemical measurements along with computational calculations provide key data for mechanistic insights. Furthermore, a direct and easy access to deuterium labeled compounds is reported.







Abstract
The recent disclosure of the ability of aromatic isocyanides to harvest visible light and act as single electron acceptors when reacting with tertiary aromatic amines has triggered a renewed interest in their application to the development of green photoredox catalytic methodologies. Accordingly, the present work explores their ability to promote the generation of both alkyl and acyl radicals starting from radical precursors such as Hantzsch esters, potassium alkyltrifluoroborates, and &#945;&#8208;oxoacids. Mechanistic studies involving UV&#8208;visible absorption and fluorescence experiments, electrochemical measurements of the ground&#8208;state redox potentials along with computational calculations of both the ground&#8208; and the excited&#8208;state redox potentials of a set of nine different aromatic isocyanides provide key insights to promote a rationale design of a new generation of isocyanide&#8208;based organic photoredox catalysts. Importantly, the green potential of the investigated chemistry is demonstrated by a direct and easy access to deuterium labeled compounds.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Driven, Non&#8208;Catalysed Ring Expansion of Silicon Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small silacycles were obtained by small molecule activation with a bromosilylene. The silacycles were treated with isonitriles to induce ring expansion reactions. The saturated rings showed two subsequent isomerisation reactions.







Abstract
Silacycles are ubiquitous building blocks. Small silacycles can typically be expanded catalytically. A silirane, silirene and phosphasilirene as well as a siletane and a silolene were prepared starting from the base&#8208;free bromosilylene [(dtbpCbz)SiBr] (dtbpCbz=1,8&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;ditertbutylphenyl)&#8208;3,6&#8208;ditertbutylcarbazolyl). As these heterocycles were derived from a dicoordinated silylene, they are susceptible to reactions with an external base. The three&#8208;membered silacycles readily undergo non&#8208;catalysed ring expansion reactions with isonitriles yielding the related four&#8208;membered silacycles. Surprisingly, the ring&#8208;expanded derivatives of the silirane undergo up to two further isomerisation reactions, first by enamine formation and then by another ring expansion. DFT computations were utilised to gauge the scope of this reactivity pattern. Three&#8208;membered silacycles should essentially universally undergo a ring expansion with isonitriles, while for four&#8208;membered silacycles, only very few instances are predicted to accommodate more challenging kinetic requirements of this ring expansion. Larger silacycles lack the ring strain energy required for this ring expansion reaction and are not expected to be expanded.

         <title>Harnessing the Peterson Reaction for the Stereospecific Synthesis of Z&#8208;Vinyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinyl ethers are valuable synthetic intermediates which are also found as natural products, including aflatoxins, rifamycins and plasmalogens. The latter are ubiquitous phospholipids in human cells and contain a vinyl ether moiety with specifically Z configuration. Although numerous methods are available for synthesis of vinyl ethers, there is a lack of methods for obtaining Z isomers of molecules of the type RCH=CHOR&#8217; that are applicable to plasmalogens. A variant of the Peterson reaction is described that generates such molecules with very high stereoselectivity (Z/E ratio: 99:1). (R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyalkylsilanes were synthesised from 1&#8208;trimethylsilylalkynes by a sequence of reduction with di&#8208;isobutylaluminium hydride to a (Z)&#8208;1&#8208;trimethylsilylalkene, epoxidation of the alkene to a 2&#8208;trimethylsilyl&#8208;3&#8208;substituted epoxide and regioselective, boron&#8208;trifluoride catalysed ring opening of the epoxide by reaction with an alcohol. Conversion of the (R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyalkylsilanes to vinyl ethers (RCH=CHOR&#8217;) was achieved under basic conditions as in a standard Peterson reaction. However, near exclusive formation of a Z vinyl ether was only achieved when the reaction was performed using potassium hydride in the non&#8208;polar solvent &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;trifluorotoluene, more polar solvents giving increasing amounts of the E isomer. The sequence described embraces a variety of substituents and precursors, proceeds in overall high yield and is readily scaleable.</dc:description>

         <title>A Guanidine&#8208;Supported &#960;&#8208;Complex of Germanium Amenable to Intramolecular C&#8208;C Cleavage in Arene and Ge Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The germylone dimNHCGe (dimNHC = diimino N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) reacts with azides N3R (R = SiMe3 or p&#8208;tolyl) to furnish the first examples of germanium &#960;&#8208;complexes, i.e. guanidine&#8208;ligated compounds (dimNHI&#8208;SiMe3)Ge (NHI= N&#8208;heterocyclic imine, R= SiMe3) and (dimNHI&#8208;Tol)Ge (R= p&#8208;tolyl). DFT calculations suggest that these species are formed by a Staudinger type replacement of dinitrogen in the azide by a nucleophilic germylone, leading to a transient carbene adduct of iminogermylidene. Heating a solution of compound (dimNHI&#8208;SiMe3)Ge to 70 &#176;C results in extrusion of the iminogermylidene that further aggregates to produce the known [Me3SiNGe]4 tetramer, whereas the imidazolylidene fragment transforms into an unusual heptatriene species that can be considered as a product of carbene insertion into the C&#8208;C bond of a pendant Ar substituent at the imidazolylidene nitrogen of the dimNHC. Reaction of (dimNHI&#8208;SiMe3)Ge with tetrachloro&#8208;o&#8208;benzoquinone results in the net transfer of a germanium atom and formation of the free diimino&#8208;guanidine ligand. This ligand also forms when (dimNHI&#8208;SiMe3)Ge is treated with azide N3(p&#8208;Tol), with the germanium product being [(p&#8208;Tol)NGe]n.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Bifuran motifs can be accessed with nickel&#8208;bipyridine electrocatalyzed homocouplings of bromine&#8208;substituted methyl furancarboxylates, which, in turn, can be prepared from hemicellulose&#8208;derived furfural. The described protocol uses sustainable carbon&#8208;based graphite electrodes in the simplest setup &#8211; an undivided cell with constant current electrolysis.

         <title>Hexanuclear Ln6L6&#160;Complex Formation by using an Unsymmetric Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multinuclear, self&#8208;assembled lanthanide complexes present clear opportunities as sensors and imaging agents. Despite the widely acknowledged potential of this class of supramolecule, synthetic and characterization challenges continue to limit systematic studies into their self&#8208;assembly restricting the number and variety of lanthanide architectures reported relative to their transition metal counterparts. Here we present the first study evaluating the effect of ligand backbone symmetry on multinuclear lanthanide complex self&#8208;assembly. Replacement of a symmetric ethylene linker with an unsymmetric amide at the centre of a homoditopic ligand governs formation of an unusual Ln6L6&#160;complex with coordinatively unsaturated metal centres. The choice of triflate as a counterion, and the effect of ionic radii are shown to be critical for formation of the Ln6L6&#160;complex. The atypical Ln6L6&#160;architecture is characterized using a combination of mass spectrometry, luminescence, DOSY NMR and EPR spectroscopy measurements. Luminescence experiments support clear differences between comparable Eu6L6&#160;and Eu2L3&#160;complexes, with relatively short luminescent lifetimes and low quantum yields observed for the Eu6L6&#160;structure indicative of non&#8208;radiative decay processes. Synthesis of the Gd6L6analogue allows three distinct Gd&#183;&#183;&#183;Gd distance measurements to be extracted using homo&#8208;RIDME EPR experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Diversification of Carbodicarbene Class by Embedding an Anionic Component in its Scaffold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbodicarbene (CDC) has become an emerging ligand in many fields due to their strong &#963;&#8208;donating ability. We report the synthesis of the first anionic CDC pincer Pd complexes containing a BF2 moiety within the framework, a charge&#8208;frustration zwitterion approach to leverage the electronic feature of carbon(0)/carbone, which is unprecedented. The elucidation of X&#8208;ray crystal structures, ligand competition as well as transmetallation experiments suggest that the anionic moiety has enhanced the overall donor strength of the traditional neutral CDC. Importantly, this anionic scaffold exhibits a facile second coordination toward Au(I), Ag(I) and Pd(II) without any external ligand assistance, whereas previously reported neutral pincer CDC complexes do not possess a two&#8208;fold donor capacity. The analysis of the bonding situation via theoretical methods shows that the description of the anionic CDC moieties in terms of dative bonding is preferred over the model of delocalized positive charge, as it accounts for the two&#8208;fold donor ability of the divalent carbon atom, preserving characteristic feature of a carbone.</dc:description>

         <title>Multigram Synthesis of Dimethyl Stellane&#8208;1,5&#8208;Dicarboxylate&#160;as a Key Precursor for the ortho&#8208;Benzene Mimics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we present previously unavailable C(sp3)&#8208;rich polycyclic hydrocarbon scaffolds which have a potential to become valuable tools in medicinal chemistry and crop science as saturated bioisosteres of benzenoids. We have developed a scalable protocol (up to 50 g from a single synthetic run) for the synthesis of tricyclo[3.3.0.03,7]octane (bisnoradamantane or stellane) 1,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid derivatives. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of the stellane 1,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester has revealed that this scaffold is an optimal saturated isostere for ortho&#8208;disubstituted benzene where substituents exhibit the in&#8208;plane topology. The synthetic protocol is based on the oxidative cyclization of dimethyl octahydropentalene&#8208;2,5&#8208;dicarboxylate (DMOD) through lithiation followed by I2 oxidation. The reaction outcome is determined by the stereochemistry of the substrate. While the endo,endo cis&#8208;DMOD,&#160; exclusively gives the "unwanted" Claisen cyclization product the exo,endo cis&#8208; and exo,exo cis&#8208; stereoisomers afford the desired stellane 1,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester quantitatively. DFT computations have revealed that the reaction proceeds via the dianion of dimethyl octahydropentalene&#8208;2,5&#8208;dicarboxylate, which undergoes SET oxidation by I2 to form a radical anion. The subsequent cyclization followed by a second SET oxidation gives desired stellane derivative.</dc:description>

         <title>Methoxylation Promoted CPET Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The manuscript discloses a methoxylation reaction to an aromatic carbonyl function that carries out a CPET reaction oxidizing a transition metal ion. Spontaneous methoxylation of a redox non&#8208;innocent fragment coordinated to a high spin cobalt(II) ion, promoted concerted proton electron transfer (CPET) reaction oxidizing cobalt(II) to cobalt(III) in air and subsequent demethoxylation induced reduction of cobalt(III) to cobalt(II) producing H2O2 are authenticated. The cobalt(III)/cobalt(II) electron transfer (ET) potential of the designed complex in CH2Cl2 is &#8208;0.27 V vs Fc+/Fc redox couple. However, in presence of MeOH the reduction potential decreases to &#8208;1.02 V due to CPET involving MeOH proton. In CH2Cl2/CHCl3 spontaneous demethoxylation occurs giving back the original complex and reactive methoxyl radical that reacts with O2 producing H2O2. Overall one molecule of MeOH produces one molecule of H2O2. To analyze the involvement of the proton, the rate constants of the CPET reactions in CH2Cl2&#8208;MeOH (2:1) and CH2Cl2&#8208;CD3OD (2:1) and the demethoxylation reaction in CHCl3 at 330 K were determined by time drive UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy.</dc:description>

The cobalt(III)/cobalt(II) electron transfer (ET) potential of the designed complex in CH2Cl2 is -0.27 V vs Fc+/Fc redox couple.

         <title>Ruthenium and Iron Co&#8208;doped Molybdenum Carbide as a Stable Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalyst in Harsh Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic water splitting is one of the most commercially valuable pathways of hydrogen production especially combined with renewable electricity; however, efficient and durable electrocatalysts are urgently needed to reduce electric energy consumption. Here, we reported a Ru and Fe co&#8208;doped Mo2C on nitrogen doped carbon via a controllable two&#8208;step method, which can be used for efficient and enduring hydrogen evolution reaction. At 10, 100 and 200 mA cm&#8208;2 in acidic electrolyte, the resultant Ru&#8208;Fe/Mo2C@NC delivered low overpotentials of 31, 78 and 103 mV, respectively, which are comparable to that of the commercial Pt/C (20 wt%). At an applied current density of 100 mA cm&#8208;2, stable hydrogen production was conducted for 120 h without obvious degradation. In alkaline media, Ru&#8208;Fe/Mo2C@NC can also deliver a current density of 100 mA cm&#8208;2 for more than 100 h. Furthermore, the Ru&#8208;Fe/Mo2C@NC electrocatalyst was used as cathode in an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer under industrial environments for robust hydrogen production. The characterization and electrochemical results prove the synergism effects between Ru, Fe dopants and Mo2C for promoting hydrogen evolution activity. This work would pave a new avenue to fabricate low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance hydrogen evolution electrocatalysts for industrial water electrolyzers.</dc:description>
