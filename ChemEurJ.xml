         <title>Catalyst Deactivation During Rhodium Complex Catalyzed Propargylic C&#8211;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Detailed mechanistic investigations on our previously reported synthesis of branched allylic esters by the rhodium complex catalyzed propargylic C&#8211;H activation have been carried out. Based on initial mechanistic studies, we present herein more detailed investigations of the reaction mechanism. For this, various analytical (NMR, X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis, Raman) and kinetic methods were used to characterize the formation of intermediates under the reaction conditions. The knowledge obtained by this was used to further optimize the previous conditions and generate a more active catalytic system.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionization and Photofragmentation of Isolated Metalloporphyrin Cations Investigated by VUV Action Spectroscopy**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolated metalloporphyrin cations FePPIX+, CoPPIX+ and ZnPPIX+ have been studied in the gas phase by action spectroscopy in the vacuum&#8208;ultraviolet (VUV) range using electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry and synchrotron radiation. The ionization energy of each compound has been measured. Photoexcitation and photoionization lead to strikingly different fragmentation pathways. Evidence for non&#8208;statistical dissociation processes including water losses were identified. Fragment assignments have been supported by additional high&#8208;resolution collision&#8208;induced dissociation experiments on a hybrid quadrupole&#8208;orbital mass spectrometer.







Abstract
We investigated the photoionization and fragmentation of isolated metal protoporphyrin IX cations (MPPIX+ with M=Fe, Co, Zn) by means of vacuum&#8208;ultraviolet (VUV) action spectroscopy in the energy range of 8.5&#8211;35&#8197;eV. Experiments were carried out in the gas phase by interfacing an electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometer with a synchrotron beamline. The mass spectra and partial ion yields show that photoexcitation of the precursor ions predominantly leads to .CH2COOH radical side&#8208;chain losses of the macrocycle with additional methyl radical (.CH3) side&#8208;chain losses. Ionization, in contrast, leads to the formation of the intact ionized precursor and various doubly charged fragments which are mostly due to side&#8208;chain cleavages. Although statistical fragmentation dominates, we found evidence for non&#8208;statistical processes such as new fragments involving for example single and double H2O losses, indicating that different relaxation mechanisms are at play upon photoionization compared to photoexcitation. The measured ionization energies were 9.6&#177;0.2&#8197;eV, 9.4&#177;0.2&#8197;eV and 9.6&#177;0.2&#8197;eV for FePPIX+, CoPPIX+ and ZnPPIX+, respectively.

         <title>Design Strategies of Si/C Composite Anode for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various Si/C materials by different synthetic methods are reviewed along with their respective advantages and disadvantages. In addition, Si/C materials formed by Si and different carbon&#8208;based materials is summarized, where the influences of carbons on the electrochemical performance of Si are emphasized. Lastly, future research direction in the material design and optimization of Si/C materials is proposed to fill the current gap in the development of efficient Si/C anode for lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Silicon&#8208;based materials that have higher theoretical specific capacity than other conventional anodes, such as carbon materials, Li2TiO3 materials and Sn&#8208;based materials, become a hot topic in research of lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB). However, the low conductivity and large volume expansion of silicon&#8208;based materials hinders the commercialization of silicon&#8208;based materials. Until recent years, these issues are alleviated by the combination of carbon&#8208;based materials. In this review, the preparation of Si/C materials by different synthetic methods in the past decade is reviewed along with their respective advantages and disadvantages. In addition, Si/C materials formed by silicon and different carbon&#8208;based materials is summarized, where the influences of carbons on the electrochemical performance of silicon are emphasized. Lastly, future research direction in the material design and optimization of Si/C materials is proposed to fill the current gap in the development of efficient Si/C anode for LIBs.

         <title>How to Prepare Kinetically Stable Self&#8208;assembled Pt12L24 Nanocages while Circumventing Kinetic Traps</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Avoiding the unwanted: Robust Pt12L24 assemblies were selectively formed by a combination of thermodynamic tuning, achieved by rigidifying the ligands, and kinetic tuning with catalytic amounts of additives. The described methodology can be applied to prepare a variety of functionalised platinum assemblies that were shown to be kinetically stable against biologically and catalytically relevant substrates.







Abstract
Supramolecular coordination&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled nanostructures have been widely studied, and currently various applications are being explored. For several applications, the stability of the nanostructure is of key importance, and this strongly depends on the metal used in the self&#8208;assembly process. Herein, design strategies and synthetic protocols to access desirable kinetically stable Pt12L24 nanospheres are reported, and it is demonstrated that these are stable under conditions under which the palladium counterparts decompose. Descriptors previously used for palladium nanospheres are insufficient for platinum analogues, as the stronger metal&#8211;ligand bond results in a mixture of kinetically trapped structures. We report that next to the dihedral angle, the rigidity of the ditopic ligand is also a key parameter for the controlled formation of Pt12L24 nanospheres. Catalytic amounts of coordinating additives to labilise the platinum&#8208;pyridyl bond to some extent are needed to selectively form Pt12L24 assemblies. The formed Pt12L24 nanospheres were demonstrated to be stable in the presence of chloride, amines and acids, unlike the palladium analogues.

         <title>The Effect of Interlayer Anion Grafting on Water Oxidation Electrocatalysis: A Comparative Study of Ni&#8208; and Co&#8208;Based Brucite&#8208;Type Layered Hydroxides, Layered Double Hydroxides and Hydroxynitrate Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grafting of interlayer anions to brucite&#8208;type layered structures impacts electrocatalytic performance. Three Ni and Co compounds are investigated: (i) brucite&#8208;type M(OH)2 (no interlayer anions), (ii) LDHs (free interlayer anions), and (iii) hydroxynitrate salts (grafted interlayer anions). Substitution of OH&#8722; by NO3&#8722; allows for larger layer separation and reduced electron density at the metal center contributing to earlier onset of OER activity.







Abstract
The urge for carbon&#8208;neutral green energy conversion and storage technologies has invoked the resurgence of interest in applying brucite&#8208;type materials as low&#8208;cost oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts in basic media. Transition metal layered hydroxides belonging to the brucite&#8208;type structure family have been shown to display remarkable electrochemical activity. Recent studies on the earth&#8208;abundant Fe3+ containing m&#246;ssbauerite and Fe3+ rich Co&#8722;Fe layered oxyhydroxide carbonates have suggested that grafted interlayer anions might play a key role in OER catalysis. To probe the effect of such interlayer anion grafting in brucite&#8208;like layered hydroxides, we report here a systematic study on the electrocatalytic performance of three distinct Ni and Co brucite&#8208;type layered structures, namely, (i) brucite&#8208;type M(OH)2 without any interlayer anions, (ii) LDHs with free interlayer anions, and (iii) hydroxynitrate salts with grafted interlayer anions. The electrochemical results indeed show that grafting has an evident impact on the electronic structure and the observed OER activity. Ni&#8208; and Co&#8208;hydroxynitrate salts with grafted anions display notably earlier formations of the electrocatalytically active species. Particularly Co&#8208;hydroxynitrate salts exhibit lower overpotentials at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (&#951;=0.34&#8197;V) and medium current densities of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (&#951;=0.40&#8197;V) compared to the corresponding brucite&#8208;type hydroxides and LDH materials.

Three Ni and Co compounds are investigated: (i) brucite-type M(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (no interlayer anions), (ii) LDHs (free interlayer anions), and (iii) hydroxynitrate salts (grafted interlayer anions). Substitution of OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; by NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; allows for larger layer separation and reduced electron density at the metal center contributing to earlier onset of OER activity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The urge for carbon-neutral green energy conversion and storage technologies has invoked the resurgence of interest in applying brucite-type materials as low-cost oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts in basic media. Transition metal layered hydroxides belonging to the brucite-type structure family have been shown to display remarkable electrochemical activity. Recent studies on the earth-abundant Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; containing m&#246;ssbauerite and Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; rich Co&#8722;Fe layered oxyhydroxide carbonates have suggested that grafted interlayer anions might play a key role in OER catalysis. To probe the effect of such interlayer anion grafting in brucite-like layered hydroxides, we report here a systematic study on the electrocatalytic performance of three distinct Ni and Co brucite-type layered structures, namely, (i) brucite-type M(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; without any interlayer anions, (ii) LDHs with free interlayer anions, and (iii) hydroxynitrate salts with grafted interlayer anions. The electrochemical results indeed show that grafting has an evident impact on the electronic structure and the observed OER activity. Ni- and Co-hydroxynitrate salts with grafted anions display notably earlier formations of the electrocatalytically active species. Particularly Co-hydroxynitrate salts exhibit lower overpotentials at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;=0.34&#8197;V) and medium current densities of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;=0.40&#8197;V) compared to the corresponding brucite-type hydroxides and LDH materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) have great potential application in a range of pioneering areas, such as quantum computing, spintronics, and high&#8208;density information storage. The properties of the molecules presented here are based on the molecular total spin and the magnetic anisotropy created by the lanthanides in a particular crystal field. An important element in SMMs&#8217; optimization is the ligand design. Poly imido sulfur ligands are perfectly suited as the polar S+&#8722;N&#8722;&#8208;bond facilitates electronic and geometric adaptability to various f&#8208;metals. Particularly the acute N&#8211;Dy&#8211;N bite angle generates advantageous magnetic properties. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Demir, D. Stalke et&#8197;al.

         <title>A Novel Reactivity of Phosphanylalumane (&gt;P&#8722;Al&lt;): Reversible Addition of a Saturated Interelement Bond to Olefins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A P&#8722;Al single&#8208;bond species, phosphanylalumane, was found to bind relatively small terminal alkenes (ethylene, propylene, and hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene). Although the ethylene adduct did notundergo any elimination of ethylene even under vacuum conditions, heating the terminal alkene adducts resulted in the release of the corresponding alkenes and regenerated the P&#8722;Al bond. Theethylene adduct can work as a new saturated C2 vicinal P/Al&#8208;based frustrated Lewis pair (FLP), showing characteristic reactivity through the elimination of ethylene. More information can be found in the Communication by Y. Mizuhata, N. Tokitoh, and T. Yanagisawa (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101649).

         <dc:description>
The quite &#8216;hidden&#8217; compound AlCr2 was isolated for the first time as micro&#8208;fabricated single crystals. Crystal structure and chemical bonding analyses reveal largely different interactions as a consequence of the inverted coloring pattern with respect to prototypical MoSi2.

         <title>In Situ Synchrotron X&#8208;ray Diffraction Studies of the Mechanochemical Synthesis of ZnS from its Elements</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of the mechanochemical synthesis of cubic ZnS from its elements via ball milling was studied by in situ synchrotron diffraction experiments coupled with gas pressure measurements inside the milling vessel. The combination of both techniques reveals a heterogeneous reaction mechanism including gaseous sulfur and solid zinc. Moreover, the reaction kinetics of the phase transition from cubic to hexagonal ZnS was determined from the in situ synchrotron diffraction experiments. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C.&#8197;Weidenthaler et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101260).

         <title>Imidazolium Functionalized Chemically Robust Ionic Porous Organic Polymers (iPOPs) toward Toxic Oxo&#8208;pollutants Capture from Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fabricating new and efficient materials aimed at containment of water contamination, in particular removing toxic heavy metal based oxo&#8208;anions (for example CrO  4  2&#8208;  , TcO  4  &#8208;  ) holds paramount importance. In this work, we report two new highly stable imidazolium based ionic porous organic polymers (  i  POPs) decorated with multiple interaction sites along with electrostatics driven adsorptive removal of such oxo&#8208;anions from water. Both the  i  POPs (namely,  i  POP&#8208;3 and  i  POP&#8208;4) exhibited rapid sieving kinetics and very high saturation uptake capacity for CrO  4  2&#8208;  anions (170 and 141 mg g  &#8208;1  for  i  POP&#8208;3 and  i  POP&#8208;4 respectively) and ReO  4  &#8208;  (515.5 and 350.3 mg g  &#8208;1  for  i  POP&#8208;3 and  i  POP&#8208;4 respectively), where ReO  4  &#8208;  anions being the non&#8208;radioactive surrogative counterpart of radioactive TcO  4  &#8208;  ions. Noticeably, both  i  POPs showed exceptional selectivity towards CrO  4  2&#8208;  and ReO  4  &#8208;  even in presence of several other concurrent anions such as Br  &#8208;  , Cl  &#8208;  , SO  4  2&#8208;  , NO  3  &#8208;  etc. The theoretical binding energy calculations via DFT method further confirmed the preferencial interaction sites as well as binding energies of both  i  POPs towards CrO  4  2&#8208;  and ReO  4  &#8208;  over all other competing anions which corroborates with the experimental high capacity and selectivity of  i  POPs towards such oxo&#8208;anions.</dc:description>

         <title>KCs2[Pb2Br5(HCOO)2]: A Polar 3D Lead&#8208;Bromide Framework Exhibiting Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of new nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals with excellent properties is in urgently demand because of their ability to generate coherent light. Herein, we report an unique NLO lead bromide formate, KCs  2  [Pb  2  Br  5  (HCOO)  2  ], which has been synthesized by a mix&#8208;solvothermal method.  KCs  2  [Pb  2  Br  5  (HCOO)  2  ] exhibits strong phase&#8208;matching second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response (6.5 &#215; KDP), large birefringence (0.16  @ 1064 nm), and wide transparent window in most visible light and mid&#8208;IR region. Interestingly, KCs  2  [Pb  2  Br  5  (HCOO)  2  ] features a polar 3D lead&#8208;bromide framework in which adjacent Pb&#8208;Br layers containing coplanar Pb  6  Br  6  rings not only parallel to each other, but also orient in the same direction. These oriented arrangements are responsible for the strong SHG response and large birefringence that are elucidated by both local dipole moment and theoretical calculations. This research provides a new strategy to explore subsequent NLO crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Ytterbium(II) Hydride as a Powerful Multielectron Reductant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A dimeric &#946;&#8208;diketiminato ytterbium(II) hydride affects both the two&#8208;electron aromatization of 1,3,5,7&#8208;cyclooctatetraene (COT) and the more challenging two&#8208;electron reduction of polyaromatic hydrocarbons, including naphthalene (E  0  = &#8211;2.60 V). Confirmed by Density Functional Theory calculations, these reactions proceed via consecutive polarized Yb&#8208;H/C=C insertion and deprotonation steps to provide the respective ytterbium(II) inverse sandwich complexes and hydrogen gas. These observations highlight the ability of a simple ytterbium(II) hydride to act as a powerful two&#8208;electron reductant at room temperature without the necessity of an external electron to initiate the reaction and avoiding radicaloid intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Trapping of Terminal Platinapolyynes by Copper(I) Catalyzed Click Cycloadditions; Probes of Labile Intermediates in Syntheses of Complexes with Extended sp Carbon Chains, and Crystallographic Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The title reactions are, by analogy to a coal miner&#8216;s canary, employed to detect unstable transient species LyPt(C&#8801;C)nH with n up to 9. These are valuable building blocks for still longer polyynes, and all of the precursors LyPt(C&#8801;C)nSiR3 and trapping products can be crystallographically characterized.







Abstract
The silylated hexatriynyl complex trans&#8208;(C6F5)(p&#8208;tol3P)2Pt(C&#8801;C)3SiEt3 (PtC6TES) is converted in&#8197;situ to PtC6H (wet n&#8208;Bu4N+ F&#8722;, THF) and cross coupled with the diyne H(C&#8801;C)2SiEt3 (HC4TES; CuCl/TMEDA, O2) to give PtC10TES (71&#8201;%). This sequence is repeated twice to afford PtC14TES (65&#8201;%) and then PtC18TES (27&#8201;%). An analogous series of reactions starting with PtC8TES gives PtC12TES (60&#8201;%), then PtC16TES (43&#8201;%), and then PtC20TES (17&#8201;%). Similar cross couplings with H(C&#8801;C)2Si(i&#8208;Pr)3 (HC4TIPS) give PtC12TIPS (68&#8201;%), PtC14TIPS (68&#8201;%), and PtC16TIPS (34&#8201;%). The trialkylsilyl species (up to PtC18TES) are converted to 3+2 &#8220;click&#8221; cycloadducts or 1,4&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles trans&#8208;(C6F5)(p&#8208;tol3P)2Pt(C&#8801;C)n&#8208;1C=CHN(CH2C6H5)N=N (29&#8211;92&#8201;% after workups). The most general procedure involves generating the terminal polyynes PtCxH (wet n&#8208;Bu4N+ F&#8722;, THF) in the presence of benzyl azide in DMF and aqueous CuSO4/ascorbic acid. All of the preceding complexes are crystallographically characterized and the structural and spectroscopic properties analyzed as a function of chain length. Two pseudopolymorphs of PtC20TES are obtained, both of which feature molecules with parallel sp carbon chains in a pairwise head/tail packing motif with extensive sp/sp van der Waals contacts.

         <title>Decoding Directing Groups and Their Pivotal Role in C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of directing groups in guiding C&#8722;H activation reactions are described with a detailed picture of the various directing groups that have become prominent in carrying out functionalizations at different sites of aromatic scaffolds. The review encompasses all the relevant works that have been conducted by different groups from all over the world and this provides sufficient information for readers who wish to carry out research in this domain.







Abstract
Synthetic organic chemistry has witnessed a plethora of functionalization and defunctionalization strategies. In this regard, C&#8722;H functionalization has been at the forefront due to the multifarious applications in the development of simple to complex molecular architectures and holds a brilliant prospect in drug development and discovery. Despite been explored tremendously by chemists, this functionalization strategy still enjoys the employment of novel metal catalysts as well metal&#8208;free organic ligands. Moreover, the switch to photo&#8208; and electrochemistry has widened our understanding of the alternative pathways via which a reaction can proceed and these strategies have garnered prominence when applied to C&#8722;H activation. Synthetic chemists have been foraging for new directing groups and templates for the selective activation of C&#8722;H bonds from a myriad of carbon&#8208;hydrogen bonds in aromatic as well as aliphatic systems. As a matter of fact, by varying the templates and directing groups, scientists found the answer to the challenge of distal C&#8722;H bond activation which remained an obstacle for a very long time. These templates have been frequently harnessed for selectively activating C&#8722;H bonds of natural products, drugs, and macromolecules decorated with multiple C&#8722;H bonds. This itself was a challenge before the commencement of this field as functionalization of a site other than the targeted site could modify and hamper the biological activity of the pharmacophore. Total synthesis and pharmacophore development often faces the difficulty of superfluous reaction steps towards selective functionalization. This obstacle has been solved by late&#8208;stage functionalization simply by harnessing C&#8722;H bond activation. Moreover, green chemistry and metal&#8208;free reaction conditions have seen light in the past few decades due to the rising concern about environmental issues. Therefore, metal&#8208;free catalysts or the usage of non&#8208;toxic metals have been recently showcased in a number of elegant works. Also, research groups across the world are developing rational strategies for directing group free or non&#8208;directed protocols that are just guided by ligands. This review encapsulates the research works pertinent to C&#8722;H bond activation and discusses the science devoted to it at the fundamental level. This review gives the readers a broad understanding of how these strategies work, the execution of various metal catalysts, and directing groups. This not only helps a budding scientist towards the commencement of his/her research but also helps a matured mind searching out for selective functionalization. A detailed picture of this field and its progress with time has been portrayed in lucid scientific language with a motive to inculcate and educate scientific minds about this beautiful strategy with an overview of the most relevant and significant works of this era. The unique trait of this review is the detailed description and classification of various directing groups and their utility over a wide substrate scope. This allows an experimental chemist to understand the applicability of this domain and employ it over any targeted substrate.

         <title>Organocatalytic Strategies for the Development of the Enantioselective Inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, a profound revision on the latest advances on the organocatalytic asymmetric inverse&#8208;electron demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction is shown.







Abstract
Cycloaddition reactions, in particular Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, have attracted a lot of attention from organic chemists since they represent one of the most powerful methodologies for the construction of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. In particular, inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions have been an important breakthrough for the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds. Among all their variants, the organocatalytic enantioselective version has been widely explored since the asymmetric construction of diversely functionalized scaffolds under reaction conditions encompassed within the green chemistry field is of great interest. In this review, a profound revision on the latest advances on the organocatalytic asymmetric inverse&#8208;electron demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction is shown.

         <title>Inclusion Complexes of Gold(I)&#8208;Dithiocarbamates with &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin: A Journey from Drug Repurposing towards Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inclusion complex of a complex: The two drugs disulfiram and aurothiomalate react to produce a gold(I)&#8208;dithiocarbamate complex, which selectively kills cancer cells. Hydroxy&#8208;substituted derivatives of this complex form inclusion complexes with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin in a rare &#8220;tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; arrangement. Formulation of one gold complex with a &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin derivative prevents formation of reactive oxygen species in mitochondria.







Abstract
The gold(I)&#8208;dithiocarbamate (dtc) complex [Au(N,N&#8208;diethyl)dtc]2 was identified as the active cytotoxic agent in the combination treatment of sodium aurothiomalate and disulfiram on a panel of cancer cell lines. In addition to demonstrating pronounced differential cytotoxicity to these cell lines, the gold complex showed no cross&#8208;resistance in therapy&#8208;surviving cancer cells. In the course of a medicinal chemistry campaign on this class of poorly soluble gold(I)&#8208;dtc complexes, &gt;35 derivatives were synthesized and X&#8208;ray crystallography was used to examine structural aspects of the dtc moiety. A group of hydroxy&#8208;substituted complexes has an improved solubility profile, and it was found that these complexes form 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8211;guest inclusion complexes with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (CD), exhibiting a rarely observed &#8220;tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; arrangement of the CD cones. Formulation of a hydroxy&#8208;substituted gold(I)&#8208;dtc complex with excess sulfobutylether&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD prevents the induction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, which is a major burden in the development of metallodrugs.

         <title>Taming the Antiferromagnetic Beast: Computational Design of Ultrashort Mn&#8722;Mn Bonds Stabilized by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Mn2 survival guide. DFT calculations were used to design synthetically achievable compounds featuring ultrashort Mn&#8722;Mn bonds stabilized by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs). We investigated the nature of the metal&#8211;carbene interaction and the role of the ancillary &#951;6 coordination in the generation of ultrashort Mn2 bonds in organometallic platforms featuring closed&#8208;shell singlet multiplicities and positive adiabatic singlet&#8211;triplet gaps. Our analysis identified two classes of potential synthetic targets, whose electrostructural properties were thoroughly examined.







Abstract
The development of complexes featuring low&#8208;valent, multiply bonded metal centers is an exciting field with several potential applications. In this work, we describe the design principles and extensive computational investigation of new organometallic platforms featuring the elusive manganese&#8208;manganese bond stabilized by experimentally realized N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs). By using DFT computations benchmarked against multireference calculations, as well as MO&#8208; and VB&#8208;based bonding analyses, we could disentangle the various electronic and structural effects contributing to the thermodynamic and kinetic stability, as well as the experimental feasibility, of the systems. In particular, we explored the nature of the metal&#8208;carbene interaction and the role of the ancillary &#951;6 coordination to the generation of Mn2 systems featuring ultrashort metal&#8208;metal bonds, closed&#8208;shell singlet multiplicities, and positive adiabatic singlet&#8208;triplet gaps. Our analysis identifies two distinct classes of viable synthetic targets, whose electrostructural properties are thoroughly investigated.

Giving directions: A rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C6&#8208;selective dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8208;pyridones with thiophenes was developed for the synthesis of 6&#8208;thiophenyl pyridin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one derivatives. In this reaction, the excellent site selectivity was directed by the 2&#8208;pyridyl on the nitrogen of the pyridone ring. Moreover, this pyridyl directing group was easily removable to generate the biheteroaryl structures with a free N&#8722;H group.







Abstract
A rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C6&#8208;selective dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8208;pyridones with thiophenes was developed for the synthesis of 6&#8208;thiophenyl pyridin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one derivatives. In this reaction, the excellent site selectivity was controlled by the 2&#8208;pyridyl directing group on the nitrogen of the pyridone ring. Control experiments indicated that the N&#8208;pyridyl was essential for the transformation. To the best of our knowledge, this procedure is the first successful example of the direct C6 heteroarylation of 2&#8208;pyridones with electron&#8208;rich thiophene derivatives. 4&#8208;Pyridone was also used as substrate to generate the corresponding C2 heteroarylated product. Moreover, this pyridyl directing group was readily removable to generate the biheteroaryl structures with a free N&#8722;H group.

         <title>Selective Oxygen and Hydrogen Functionalization of the h&#8208;BN/Rh(111) Nanomesh</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present detailed studies on the covalent adsorption of molecular oxygen and atomic hydrogen on the hexagonal boron nitride (  h  &#8209;BN) nanomesh on Rh(111). The functionalization of this two&#8208;dimensional (2D) material was investigated under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions using synchrotron radiation&#8208;based  in situ  high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, temperature&#8208;programmed X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. We are able to provide a deep insight into the adsorption behavior and thermal stability of oxygen and hydrogen on  h  &#8209;BN/Rh(111). Oxygen functionalization was achieved via a supersonic molecular beam while hydrogen functionalization was realized using an atomic hydrogen source. Adsorption of the respective species was observed to occur selectively in the pores of  h  &#8208;BN leading to spatially defined modification of the 2D&#160;layer. The adsorption of the observed molecular oxygen species was found to be an activated process that requires high&#8208;energy oxygen molecules. Upon heating to 700&#160;K, oxygen functionalization was observed to be almost reversible except for small amounts of boron oxides evolving due to the reaction of oxygen with the 2D&#160;material. Hydrogen functionalization of  h  &#8209;BN/Rh(111) was fully reversed upon heating to about 640&#160;K.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Phase engineering of the electrode materials in terms of designing heterostructures, introducing heteroatom and defects, improves great prospects in accelerating the charge storage kinetics during the repeated Li  +  /Na  +  insertion/deintercalation. Herein, a new design of Li/Na&#8208;ion battery anodes through phase regulating is reported consisting of F doped SnO  2  &#8208;SnS  2  heterostructures nanocrystals with oxygen/sulfur vacancies (V  O  /V  S  ) anchored on 2D sulfur/nitrogen&#8208;doped reduced graphene oxide matrix (F&#8208;SnO  2&#8208;x  &#8208;SnS  2&#8208;x  @N/S&#8208;RGO). Consequently, F&#8208;SnO  2&#8208;x  &#8208;SnS  2&#8208;x  @N/S&#8208;RGO anode demonstrates superb high reversible capacity and long&#8208;term cycling stability. Moreover, it exhibits excellent great rate capability with 589 mAh g  &#8208;1  for Li  +  and 296 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 5 A g  &#8208;1  for Na  +  . The enhanced Li/Na storage properties of the nanocomposites are not only attributed to the increase in conductivity caused by V  O  /V  S  and F doping (confirmed by DFT calculations) to accelerate their charge&#8208;transfer kinetics but also the increased interaction between F&#8208;SnO  2&#8208;x  &#8208;SnS  2&#8208;x  and Li/Na through heterostructure.

Six types of polyoxometalates (POMs) with different structures and compositions are firstly selected to modify the friction materials of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). The strong electron&#8208;accepting and storage capabilities of POMs can promote the transfer of electrons from semiconductors to metals, laying a foundation for the application of POMs in a new field. and providing a new method for increasing the electrical output of TENGs.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost durable triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) is essential for converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. Many organic polymer friction materials used widely have thermal stability problems, which makes TENGs with semiconductors as friction materials stand out. Here, we report a semi&#8208;flexible TENG based on metal and TiO2 modified by polyoxometalates (POMs) as pure inorganic friction materials. Six different POMs are firstly selected to modify the friction materials of TENGs, and the output performance of TENGs with different POMs&#8208;modified semiconductors and different metals as friction materials are tested. Compared with the unmodified TENGs, the open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of the optimal Ag&#8208;K6P2Mo18O62(P2Mo18)/TiO2 TENG device is increased by more than 4 times, which is mainly attributed to the strong electron&#8208;accepting and storage capabilities of POMs. This study has demonstrated that TENGs modified by POMs have potential application prospects and provided a new method for increasing the electrical output of TENGs.

         <title>Amorphous Calcium Phosphates: Solvent&#8208;Controlled Growth and Stabilization through the Epoxide Route</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 39, Page 10077-10086, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) is a key nanobiomaterial where shape, size and phase purity remain as a synthetic challenge. Herein, we have adapted the Epoxide Route for the synthesis of pure and stable ACP colloids by using biocompatible solvents such as ethylene glycol and/or glycerine. The solvent mixture can be used as a new green tool to control the size (from 60 nm to &gt;500 nm) and the internal mesostructured (fractal dimension).







Abstract
Calcium phosphates stand among the most promising nanobiomaterials in key biomedical applications, such as bone repairment, signalling or drug/gene delivery. Their intrinsic properties as crystalline structure, composition, particle shape and size define their successful use. Among these compounds, metastable amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) is currently gaining particular attention due to its inherently high reactivity in solution, which is crucial in bone development mechanisms. However, the preparation of this highly desired (bio)material with control over its shape, size and phase purity remains as a synthetic challenge. In this work, the epoxide route was adapted for the synthesis of pure and stable ACP colloids. By using biocompatible solvents, such as ethylene glycol and/or glycerine, it was possible to avoid the natural tendency of ACP to maturate into more stable and crystalline apatites. Moreover, this procedure offers size control, ranging from small nanoparticles (60&#8197;nm) to micrometric spheroids (&gt;500&#8197;nm). The eventual fractalization of the internal mesostructured can be tuned, by simply adjusting the composition of the ethylene glycol:glycerine solvent mixture. These findings introduce the use of green solvents as a new tool to control crystallinity and/or particle size in the synthesis of nanomaterials, avoiding the use of capping agents and preserving the natural chemical reactivity of the pristine surface.

         <title>Design and Application of Mini&#8208;libraries of miRNA Probes for an Efficient and Versatile miRNA&#8208;mRNA Cross&#8208;linking</title>

We describe a new class of miRNA probes with photo&#8208;active trioxsalen attached via oligoethylene glycol&#8208;based linkers. These cross&#8208;link to RNA targets in&#8197;vitro with efficiencies dependent on sequence and linker&#8208;length. By using controlled mixtures of probes, a general approach to efficient covalent target&#8208;capture independent of miRNAs sequence is proposed.







Abstract
MicroRNAs constitute a class of endogenous, non&#8208;coding RNAs that influence various processes within the cell. By base&#8208;pairing to partially&#8208;complementary sites located in the 3&#8217; untranslated region of target messenger RNAs, microRNAs participate in post&#8208;transcriptional regulation of the majority of human protein&#8208;coding genes. Their dysregulation has been related to many pathological processes and diseases. Thus, an in&#8208;depth understanding of the microRNA mechanisms of action is crucial. Here, we present a new concept of probe design to achieve an efficient and sequence&#8208;independent miRNA&#8208;mRNA cross&#8208;linking. The new strategy is based on the utilization of a controlled mixture of probes for a chosen miRNA, in which a trioxsalen moiety is introduced at the N4&#8208;position of a selected cytidine through short oligoethylene glycol&#8208;based linkers. In vitro photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking experiments with mini&#8208;libraries of probes for microRNAs of interest showed variable cross&#8208;linking efficiencies, demonstrating a general applicability of the presented approach.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Polyoxometalate&#8208;Resorcin[4]arene&#8208;Based Inorganic&#8208;Organic Complexes: Metal Ion Effects on the Electrochemical Performance of Lithium Ion Batteries</title>

New resources from resorcin: Three polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;resorcin[4]arene&#8208;based inorganic&#8211;organic materials (1&#8211;3) with different metal ions have been synthesized. Their composites 1@RGO&#8208;3@RGO were created by anchoring 1&#8211;3 on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) to enhance the conductivities. These composites show different electrochemical performances for lithium ion batteries.







Abstract
With their adjustable structures and diverse functions, polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;resorcin[4]arene&#8208;based inorganic&#8211;organic complexes are a kind of potential multifunctional material. They have potential applications for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). However, the relationship between different coordinated metal ions and electrochemical performance has rarely been investigated. Here, three functionalized POM&#8208;resorcin[4]arene&#8208;based inorganic&#8211;organic materials, [Co2(TMR4&#8197;A)2(H2O)10][SiW12O40]&#8901;2&#8201;EtOH&#8901;4.5&#8201;H2O (1), [Ni2(TMR4&#8197;A)2(H2O)10][SiW12O40]&#8901;4&#8201;EtOH&#8901;13&#8201;H2O (2), and [Zn2(TMR4&#8197;A)2(H2O)10][SiW12O40]&#8901;2&#8201;EtOH&#8901;2&#8201;H2O (3), have been synthesized. Furthermore, to enhance the conductivities of these compounds, 1&#8211;3 were doped with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) to give composites 1@RGO&#8208;3@RGO, respectively. As anode materials for LIBs, 1@RGO&#8208;3@RGO can deliver very high discharge capacities (1445.9, 1285.0 and 1095.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively) in the initial run, and show discharge capacities of 898, 665 and 651&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively, at a current density of 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 100 runs. More importantly, the discharge capacities of 319, 283 and 329&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 were maintained for 1@RGO&#8208;3@RGO even after 400 cycles at large current density (1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1).

         <title>Towards DNA&#8208;Encoded Micellar Chemistry: DNA&#8208;Micelle Association and Environment Sensitivity of Catalysis</title>

It&#8242;s a matter of environment: Copolymer micelles attracted DNA oligonucleotide conjugates in aqueous solution despite lacking canonical DNA&#8208;binding motifs. Following accumulation inside micelles, DNA&#8208;coupled starting materials underwent Povarov and Biginelli reactions to target molecules by a localized sulfonic acid. The kinetics of a given reaction were tuned by the chemical environment within the micelles.







Abstract
The development of DNA&#8208;compatible reaction methodologies is a central theme to advance DNA&#8208;encoded screening library technology. Recently, we were able to show that sulfonic acid&#8208;functionalized block copolymer micelles facilitated Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;promoted reactions such as the Povarov reaction on DNA&#8208;coupled starting materials with minimal DNA degradation. Here, the impact of polymer composition on micelle shape, and reaction conversion was investigated. A dozen sulfonic acid&#8208;functionalized block copolymers of different molar mass and composition were prepared by RAFT polymerization and were tested in the Povarov reaction, removal of the Boc protective group, and the Biginelli reaction. The results showed trends in the polymer structure&#8208;micellar catalytic activity relationship. For instance, micelles composed of block copolymers with shorter acrylate ester chains formed smaller particles and tended to provide faster reaction kinetics. Moreover, fluorescence quenching experiments as well as circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that DNA&#8208;oligomer&#8208;conjugates, although highly water&#8208;soluble, accumulated very effectively in the micellar compartments, which is a prerequisite for carrying out a DNA&#8208;encoded reaction in the presence of polymer micelles.

Moreover, fluorescence quenching experiments as well as circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that DNA-oligomer-conjugates, although highly water-soluble, accumulated very effectively in the micellar compartments, which is a prerequisite for carrying out a DNA-encoded reaction in the presence of polymer micelles.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Comprehensive Characterization of the Self&#8208;Folding Cavitand Dynamics</title>

         <dc:description>
The complex dynamic behavior of a self&#8208;folding cavitand receptor has been thoroughly characterized employing molecular dynamics simulations and 1H EXSY experiments. The exchange barriers extracted from accelerated molecular dynamics simulations are in very good agreement with experimentally determined values. Overall, the presented approach emerges as a useful tool for the rational design of dynamic host&#8208;guest systems.







Abstract
The conformational equilibria and guest exchange process of a resorcin[4]arene derived self&#8208;folding cavitand receptor have been characterized in detail by molecular dynamics simulations (MD) and 1H EXSY NMR experiments. A multi&#8208;timescale strategy for exploring the fluxional behaviour of this system has been constructed, exploiting conventional MD and accelerated MD (aMD) techniques. The use of aMD allows the reconstruction of the folding/unfolding process of the receptor by sampling high&#8208;energy barrier processes unattainable by conventional MD simulations. We obtained MD trajectories sampling events occurring at different timescales from ns to s: 1) rearrangement of the directional hydrogen bond seam stabilizing the receptor, 2) folding/unfolding of the structure transiting partially open intermediates, and 3) guest departure from different folding stages. Most remarkably, reweighing of the biased aMD simulations provided kinetic barriers that are in very good agreement with those determined experimentally by 1H NMR. These results constitute the first comprehensive characterization of the complex dynamic features of cavitand receptors. Our approach emerges as a valuable rational design tool for synthetic host&#8208;guest systems

         <title>Pyrroloquinoline Quinone Aza&#8208;Crown Ether Complexes as Biomimetics for Lanthanide and Calcium Dependent Alcohol Dehydrogenases**
</title>

         <dc:description>
A pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) based model system was used for the investigation of different factors that may have an impact on the oxidation reaction in the active sites of alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes. Using various metal salts, the influence of ion size and charge, as well as counterions was investigated. The study involves NMR and EPR analysis as well as advanced mass spectrometry techniques.







Abstract
Understanding the role of metal ions in biology can lead to the development of new catalysts for several industrially important transformations. Lanthanides are the most recent group of metal ions that have been shown to be important in biology, that is, in quinone&#8208;dependent methanol dehydrogenases (MDH). Here we evaluate a literature&#8208;known pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) and 1&#8208;aza&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 based ligand platform as scaffold for Ca2+, Ba2+, La3+ and Lu3+ biomimetics of MDH and we evaluate the importance of ligand design, charge, size, counterions and base for the alcohol oxidation reaction using NMR spectroscopy. In addition, we report a new straightforward synthetic route (3 steps instead of 11 and 33&#8201;% instead of 0.6&#8201;% yield) for biomimetic ligands based on PQQ. We show that when studying biomimetics for MDH, larger metal ions and those with lower charge in this case promote the dehydrogenation reaction more effectively and that this is likely an effect of the ligand design which must be considered when studying biomimetics. To gain more information on the structures and impact of counterions of the complexes, we performed collision induced dissociation (CID) experiments and observe that the nitrates are more tightly bound than the triflates. To resolve the structure of the complexes in the gas phase we combined DFT&#8208;calculations and ion mobility measurements (IMS). Furthermore, we characterized the obtained complexes and reaction mixtures using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and show the presence of a small amount of quinone&#8208;based radical.

         <title>Effect of Topology on Photodynamic Sterilization of Porphyrinic Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>

Guide for designing photosensitizers: The effect of the topololgy of porphyrinic zirconium metal&#8208;organic frameworks on 1O2 generation and photodynamic antibacterial performance was studied in four model MOFs. The number of porphyrin (TCPP) molecules per Zr6O8 cluster, the pore size and the distance between inter&#8208;TCPP active sites, which are caused by variations in the MOF&#8242;s topology, play important roles in 1O2 generation.Thus, this work provides guidance for designing new MOFs as photosensitizers in photodynamic sterilization and therapy.







Abstract
Porphyrinic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising photosensitizers due to the lack of self&#8208;aggregation of porphyrin in aqueous solution. However, how the topology of porphyrinic MOFs affects the generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) is unclear. Here, the effect of the topology of porphyrinic MOFs on their photodynamic performance is reported. Four porphyrinic zirconium MOFs (MOF&#8208;525, MOF&#8208;545, PCN&#8208;223 and PCN&#8208;224 with different topologies: ftw, csq, shp and she, respectively) were selected to study the influence of topology on the photodynamic antibacterial performance. The 1O2 generation and the photodynamic antibacterial performance followed an decreasing order of MOF&#8208;545&gt;MOF&#8208;525&gt;PCN&#8208;224&gt;PCN&#8208;223. The results reveal that the pore size, the distance between porphyrin, and the number of porphyrin per Zr6O8 cluster in MOFs greatly affected 1O2 generation. This work provides guidance for designing new MOFs for efficient photodynamic sterilization.

         <title>Macrocyclic Complexes Derived from Four cis&#8208;L2Pt Corners and Four Butadiynediyl Linkers; Syntheses, Electronic Structures, and Square versus Skew Rhombus Geometries</title>

Complexes with cyclic Pt4C16 cores comprised of platinum(II) corners and butadiynediyl edges were synthesized, and their geometric and electronic structures as well as spectroscopic and redox properties closely examined.







Abstract
The dialkyl malonate derived 1,3&#8208;diphosphines R2C(CH2PPh2)2 (R=a, Me; b, Et; c, n&#8208;Bu; d, n&#8208;Dec; e, Bn; f, p&#8208;tolCH2) are combined with (p&#8208;tol3P)2PtCl2 or trans&#8208;(p&#8208;tol3P)2Pt((C&#8801;C)2H)2 to give the chelates cis&#8208;(R2C(CH2PPh2)2)PtCl2 (2&#8201;a&#8211;f, 94&#8211;69&#8201;%) or cis&#8208;(R2C(CH2PPh2)2)Pt((C&#8801;C)2H)2 (3&#8201;a&#8211;f, 97&#8211;54&#8201;%). Complexes 3&#8201;a&#8211;d are also available from 2&#8201;a&#8211;d and excess 1,3&#8208;butadiyne in the presence of CuI (cat.) and excess HNEt2 (87&#8211;65&#8201;%). Under similar conditions, 2 and 3 react to give the title compounds [(R2C(CH2PPh2)2)[Pt(C&#8801;C)2]4 (4&#8201;a&#8211;f; 89&#8211;14&#8201;% (64&#8201;% avg)), from which ammonium salts such as the co&#8208;product [H2NEt2]+ Cl&#8722; are challenging to remove. Crystal structures of 4&#8201;a,b show skew rhombus as opposed to square Pt4 geometries. The NMR and IR properties of 4&#8201;a&#8211;f are similar to those of mono&#8208; or diplatinum model compounds. However, cyclic voltammetry gives only irreversible oxidations. As compared to mono&#8208;platinum or Pt(C&#8801;C)2Pt species, the UV&#8208;visible spectra show much more intense and red&#8208;shifted bands. Time dependent DFT calculations define the transitions and principal orbitals involved. Electrostatic potential surface maps reveal strongly negative Pt4C16 cores that likely facilitate ammonium cation binding. Analogous electronic properties of Pt3C12 and Pt5C20 homologs and selected equilibria are explored computationally.

Complexes &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;d&lt;/b&gt; are also available from &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;d&lt;/b&gt; and excess 1,3-butadiyne in the presence of CuI (cat.) and excess HNEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (87&#8211;65&#8201;%). Under similar conditions, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; react to give the title compounds [(R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)[Pt(C&#8801;C)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;4&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;f&lt;/b&gt;; 89&#8211;14&#8201;% (64&#8201;% avg)), from which ammonium salts such as the co-product [H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; are challenging to remove. Crystal structures of &lt;b&gt;4&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt; show skew rhombus as opposed to square Pt&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; geometries. The NMR and IR properties of &lt;b&gt;4&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;f&lt;/b&gt; are similar to those of mono- or diplatinum model compounds. However, cyclic voltammetry gives only irreversible oxidations. As compared to mono-platinum or Pt(C&#8801;C)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pt species, the UV-visible spectra show much more intense and red-shifted bands. Time dependent DFT calculations define the transitions and principal orbitals involved. Electrostatic potential surface maps reveal strongly negative Pt&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; cores that likely facilitate ammonium cation binding. Analogous electronic properties of Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and Pt&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; homologs and selected equilibria are explored computationally.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Take your Positions and Shine: Effects of Positioning Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminophores within Sequence&#8208;Defined Macromolecules</title>

         <dc:description>
Sequence&#8208;defined oligo(amidoamines) are employed to develop supramolecular ligands with AIE properties for detection of binding. Special focus is devoted to varying the position of the AIE luminophore within the scaffold and in relation to the supramolecular binding motif. A strong influence of the position on the resulting AIE properties is shown and evaluated for the ligand binding to various natural and synthetic polyanions.







Abstract
A luminophore with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) is employed for the conjugation onto supramolecular ligands to allow for detection of ligand binding. Supramolecular ligands are based on the combination of sequence&#8208;defined oligo(amidoamine) scaffolds and guanidiniocarbonyl&#8208;pyrrole (GCP) as binding motif. We hypothesize that AIE properties are strongly affected by positioning of the luminophore within the ligand scaffold. Therefore, we systematically investigate the effects placing the AIE luminophore at different positions within the overall construct, for example, in the main or side chain of the olig(amidoamine). Indeed, we can show that the position within the ligand structure strongly affects AIE, both for the ligand itself as well as when applying the ligand for the detection of different biological and synthetic polyanions.

A QM/MM computational study of two possible inhibition mechanisms of rhodesain cysteine protease by the dipeptidyl enoate Cbz&#8208;Phe&#8208;Leu&#8208;CH=CH&#8722;CO2C2H5 confirms the dual mode of action of this family of inhibitors. Efforts focused on increasing the interaction with the residues of the S2 pocket of rhodesain could be used as a guide to design new dual inhibitors with greater selectivity and affinity.







Abstract
A computational study of the two possible inhibition mechanisms of rhodesain cysteine protease by the dipeptidyl enoate Cbz&#8208;Phe&#8208;Leu&#8208;CH=CH&#8722;CO2C2H5 has been carried out by means of molecular dynamics simulations with hybrid QM/MM potentials. The low free energy barriers confirm that the Cys25 residue can attack both C&#946; and C1 atoms of the inhibitor, confirming a dual mode of action in the inhibition of the rhodesain by enoates. According to the results, the inhibition process through the Cys25 attack on the C&#946; atom of the inhibitor is an exergonic and irreversible process, while the inhibition process when Cys25 attacks on the C1 atom of the inhibitor is and exergonic but reversible process. The interactions between the inhibitor and rhodesain suggest that P2 is the most important fragment to consider in the design of new efficient inhibitors of rhodesain. These results may be useful for the design of new inhibitors of rhodesain and other related cysteine proteases based on dipeptidyl enoates scaffolds.

         <title>Single&#8208;Round DNA Aptamer Selection by Combined Use of Capillary Electrophoresis and Next Generation Sequencing: An Aptaomics Approach for Identifying Unique Functional Protein&#8208;Binding DNA Aptamers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 39, Page 10058-10067, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA Aptaomics is proposed for finding functional DNA aptamers by a semi&#8208;comprehensive and quantitative single&#8208;round selection using capillary electrophoresis and next generation sequencing according to a selection rule based on analogous sequences. By mining sequence data obtained from sub&#8208;libraries with different DNA conformations, structure&#8208;induced (FRET type) aptamers for thrombin were reasonably selected for the first time.







Abstract
In DNA aptamer selection, existing methods do not discriminate aptamer sequences based on their binding affinity and function and the reproducibility of the selection is often poor, even for the selection of well&#8208;known aptamers like those that bind the commonly used model protein thrombin. In the present study, a novel single&#8208;round selection method (SR&#8208;CE selection) was developed by combining capillary electrophoresis (CE) with next generation sequencing. Using SR&#8208;CE selection, a successful semi&#8208;quantitative and semi&#8208;comprehensive aptamer selection for thrombin was demonstrated with high reproducibility for the first time. Selection rules based on dissociation equilibria and kinetics were devised to obtain families of analogous sequences. Selected sequences of the same family were shown to bind thrombin with high affinity. Furthermore, data acquired from SR&#8208;CE selection was mined by creating sub&#8208;libraries that were categorized by the functionality of the aptamers (e.&#8201;g., pre&#8208;organized aptamers versus structure&#8208;induced aptamers). Using this approach, a novel fluorescent molecular recognition sensor for thrombin with nanomolar detection limits was discovered. Thus, in this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept report, we have demonstrated the potential of a &#8220;DNA Aptaomics&#8221; approach to systematically design functional aptamers as well as to obtain high affinity aptamers.

         <title>Solvent Effects in Halogen and Hydrogen Bonding Mediated Electrochemical Anion Sensing in Aqueous Solution and at Interfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 39, Page 10201-10209, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active ferrocenyl receptors enable electrochemical anion sensing in highly competitive aqueous solvent media, with a sensory performance that is markedly dependent on the nature of the non&#8208;covalent interaction. In solution, the halogen bonding sensor (XB) is superior and significantly less sensitive to solvent polarity, while surface immobilisation is associated with an enhanced performance, particularly for the hydrogen bonding (HB) system.







Abstract
Sensing anionic species in competitive aqueous media is a well&#8208;recognised challenge to long&#8208;term applications across a multitude of fields. Herein, we report a comprehensive investigation of the electrochemical anion sensing performance of novel halogen bonding (XB) and hydrogen bonding (HB) bis&#8208;ferrocene&#8208;(iodo)triazole receptors in solution and at self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs), in a range of increasingly competitive aqueous organic solvent media (ACN/H2O).

     alt="Solvent Effects in Halogen and Hydrogen Bonding Mediated Electrochemical Anion Sensing in Aqueous Solution and at Interfaces"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Redox-active ferrocenyl receptors&lt;/b&gt; enable electrochemical anion sensing in highly competitive aqueous solvent media, with a sensory performance that is markedly dependent on the nature of the non-covalent interaction. In solution, the halogen bonding sensor (XB) is superior and significantly less sensitive to solvent polarity, while surface immobilisation is associated with an enhanced performance, particularly for the hydrogen bonding (HB) system.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensing anionic species in competitive aqueous media is a well-recognised challenge to long-term applications across a multitude of fields. Herein, we report a comprehensive investigation of the electrochemical anion sensing performance of novel halogen bonding (XB) and hydrogen bonding (HB) bis-ferrocene-(iodo)triazole receptors in solution and at self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), in a range of increasingly competitive aqueous organic solvent media (ACN/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). In solution, the XB sensor notably outperforms the HB sensor, with substantial anion recognition induced cathodic voltammetric responses of the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple persisting even in highly competitive aqueous solvent media of 20&#8201;% water content. The response to halides, in particular, shows a markedly lower sensitivity to increasing water content associated with a unique halide selectivity at unprecedented levels of solvent polarity. The HB sensor, in contrast, generally displayed a preference towards oxoanions. A significant surface-enhancement effect was observed for both XB/HB receptive films in all solvent systems, whereby the HB sensor generally displayed larger responses towards oxoanions than its halogen bonding analogue.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Easily Available, Amphiphilic Diiron Cyclopentadienyl Complexes Exhibit in Vitro Anticancer Activity in 2D and 3D Human Cancer Cells through Redox Modulation Triggered by CO Release</title>

         <dc:description>
A class of cationic diiron complexes containing a variable bridging iminium ligand displays promising antiproliferative activity towards a panel of 2D and 3D cancer cell lines, and a selectivity not correlated to a different degree of uptake in cancerous and noncancerous cells. The mode of action appears to be mainly related to the interference with cell redox processes (ROS production, inhibition of TrxR), initiated by intracellular CO release.







Abstract
A straightforward two&#8208;step procedure via single CO removal allows the conversion of commercial [Fe2Cp2(CO)4] into a range of amphiphilic and robust ionic complexes based on a hybrid aminocarbyne/iminium ligand, [Fe2Cp2(CO)3{CN(R)(R&#8217;)}]X (R, R&#8217;=alkyl or aryl; X=CF3SO3 or BF4), on up to multigram scales. Their physicochemical properties can be modulated by an appropriate choice of N&#8208;substituents and counteranion. Tested against a panel of human cancer cell lines, the complexes were shown to possess promising antiproliferative activity and to circumvent multidrug resistance. Interestingly, most derivatives also retained a significant cytotoxic activity against human cancer 3D cell cultures. Among them, the complex with R=4&#8208;C6H4OMe and R&#8217;=Me emerged as the best performer of the series, being on average about six times more active against cancer cells than a noncancerous cell line, and displayed IC50 values comparable to those of cisplatin in 3D cell cultures. Mechanistic studies revealed the ability of the complexes to release carbon monoxide and to act as oxidative stress inducers in cancer cells.

         <title>Pd/Cu Dual&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Synthesis of Highly Functional All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Stereocenters from Vinyl Carbonates</title>

Dual nature nurtures yield: Compounds with highly functional quaternary stereocenters can be prepared through a Pd/Cu dual&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling of vinyl cyclic carbonates. These elusive products are produced in good yields of up to 84&#8201;% and er values of up to 90&#8201;:&#8201;10. Mechanistic control reactions underline the crucial role of various additives and a Lewis acid co&#8208;catalyst that, in concert, mediate the stabilization and coupling of a dienolate intermediate to an electrophilic allyl species.







Abstract
The challenging metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of highly functional quaternary carbon centers using decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation reactions is reported. The key substrate, a vinyl cyclic carbonate, is activated to provide concomitantly both the requisite nucleophile (by formal umpolung) and electrophile reaction partner preceding the asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling process. A wide screening of reaction conditions, additives and catalyst precursors afforded a protocol that gave access to a series of compounds featuring densely functionalized, elusive quaternary carbon stereocenters in appreciable yield and with enantiomeric ratios (er's) of up to 90&#8201;:&#8201;10.

Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) property is not based on solvent crystallization molecules but hydrated polyoxometalate(POM)&#8211;based Na9[Er(W5O18)2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;35H2O and its dehydrated form relax differently. Experimental and theoretical investigations evidence that the stability of the edifice depends on labile water molecules. Furthermore, isotopic enrichment at ErIII site shows that the relaxation dynamics in the quantum regime depends on the nuclear spin.







Abstract
Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) property is by essence molecular, while commonly measured in solid crystalline state. Solvent crystallization molecules are usually neglected in the analysis and interpretation of solid&#8208;state properties. The solvation/desolvation process in the polyoxometalate(POM)&#8208;based Na9[Er(W5O18)2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;35&#8201;H2O SMM demonstrates that the dehydrated form relaxes more than 1000 times faster than the initial state, while the rehydration process allows the quasi complete recovering of the initial magnetic behaviour. This dehydration process is monitored by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and temperature&#8208;dependent X&#8208;ray powder diffraction, and rationalized by periodic quantum chemical calculations evidencing the tremendous role of the labile water molecules in the stability of the edifice. Ab&#8208;initio calculations highlight that sodium ions localization in the structure drive the magnetic responses. Isotopic enrichment with nuclear spin free (166Er, I=0) ErIII ions shows that the relaxation dynamics in the quantum regime depends on the nuclear spin.

         <title>Dipyrrolyldiketone PtII Complexes: Ion&#8208;Pairing &#960;&#8208;Electronic Systems with Various Anion&#8208;Binding Modes</title>

Dipyrrolyldiketone PtII complexes, as phosphorescence&#8208;emitting and anion&#8208;responsive &#960;&#8208;electronic systems with planar geometries, were synthesized to construct ion&#8208;pairing assemblies in the form of anion complexes. The ordered arrangements of the anion complexes and countercations, including porphyrin AuIII complexes, were formed via noncovalent interactions between oppositely and identically charged species in the solid state.







Abstract
A variety of &#960;&#8208;electronic ion&#8208;pairing assemblies can be constructed by combining anion complexes of &#960;&#8208;electronic systems and countercations. In this study, a series of anion&#8208;responsive &#960;&#8208;electronic molecules, dipyrrolyldiketone PtII complexes containing a phenylpyridine ligand, were synthesized. The resulting PtII complexes exhibited phosphorescence emission, with higher emission quantum yields (0.30&#8211;0.42) and microsecond&#8208;order lifetimes, and solution&#8208;state anion binding, as revealed by our spectroscopic analyses. These PtII complexes displayed solid&#8208;state ion&#8208;pairing assemblies, exhibiting various anion&#8208;binding modes, which derived from pyrrole&#8208;inverted and pyrrole&#8208;non&#8208;inverted conformations, and packing structures, with the contribution of charge&#8208;by&#8208;charge assemblies, which were dependent on the substituents in the PtII complexes and the geometries and electronic states of their countercations.

These Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes displayed solid-state ion-pairing assemblies, exhibiting various anion-binding modes, which derived from pyrrole-inverted and pyrrole-non-inverted conformations, and packing structures, with the contribution of charge-by-charge assemblies, which were dependent on the substituents in the Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes and the geometries and electronic states of their countercations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synthesis of Difluoroglycine Derivatives from Amines, Difluorocarbene, and CO2: Computational Design, Scope, and Applications</title>

In theory and in practice: A three&#8208;component reaction of amine, difluorocarbene, and CO2 to form an &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroglycine core was predicted by the artificial force&#8208;induced reaction method and successfully demonstrated in experiment with a broad range of tert&#8208;amines and heteroaromatic compounds. Moreover, the products can be used for the generation of difluorocarbene without any additives, difluoroalkylation under photoredox conditions, and synthesis of metal&#8208;NHC complexes.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component reaction (3CR) for the synthesis of difluoroglycine derivatives has been achieved by using amines, difluorocarbene (generated in&#8197;situ), and the abundant, inexpensive, and nontoxic C1 source CO2. Various tert&#8208;amines and pyridine, (iso)quinoline, imidazole, thiazole, and pyrazole derivatives were incorporated, and the corresponding products were isolated in solid form without purification by column chromatography on silica gel. Detailed reaction profiles of the 3CR were obtained from computational analysis using DFT calculations, and the results critically suggest that simple ammonia is not applicable to this reaction. In addition, as strongly supported by computational predictions, a new reagent that can generate difluorocarbene at 0&#8201;&#176;C without any additives was discovered. Finally, radical substitution reactions of the obtained difluoroglycine derivatives under photoredox conditions, as well as a synthetic application as an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand are shown.

         <title>Mixed Cu2Se Hexagonal Nanosheets@Co3Se4 Nanospheres for High&#8208;Performance Asymmetric Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 39, Page 10134-10141, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu2Se hexagonal nanosheets@Co3Se4 nanospheres mixed structures have been obtained via a facile two&#8208;step hydrothermal method. The asymmetric supercapacitor with Cu2Se@Co3Se4 as anode and graphene as cathode can provide wide work potential of 1.6&#8197;V, and delivers high energy density of 30.9&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at the power density of 0.74&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with a desirable lifespan (85.8&#8201;% after 10&#8201;000&#8197;charge&#8208;discharge cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1).







Abstract
Rational designing and constructing multiphase hybrid electrode materials is an effective method to compensate for the performance defects of the single component. Based on this strategy, Cu2Se hexagonal nanosheets@Co3Se4 nanospheres mixed structures have been fabricated by a facile two&#8208;step hydrothermal method. Under the synergistic effect of the high ionic conductivity of Cu2Se and the remarkable cycling stability of Co3Se4, Cu2Se@Co3Se4 can exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance as a novel electrode material. The as&#8208;prepared Cu2Se@Co3Se4 electrode displays high specific capacitance of 1005&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with enhanced rate capability (56&#8201;% capacitance retention at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and ultralong lifespan (94.2&#8201;% after 10&#8201;000 cycles at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). An asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled applying the Cu2Se@Co3Se4 as anode and graphene as cathode, which delivers a wide work potential window of 1.6&#8197;V, high energy density (30.9&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 0.74&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1), high power density (21.0&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 7.50&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1), and excellent cycling stability (85.8&#8201;% after 10&#8201;000 cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1).

Zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework materials (Zr&#8722;MOFs) have more practical usage over most conventional benchmark porous materials and even many other MOFs due to the excellent structural stability, rich coordination forms, and various active sites. However, their mass&#8208;production and application are restricted by the high&#8208;cost raw materials, complex synthesis procedures, harsh reaction conditions, and unexpected environmental impact, and considerable green chemistry efforts have been applied breaking through the limitations, and significant progress has been made in the sustainable synthesis of Zr&#8722;MOFs over the past decade. For more information, see the Review by J. Fu and Y. Wu on page&#8197;9967.

The development of DNA&#8208;compatible reactions is central to advance DNA&#8208;encoded library technology. Amphiphilic block copolymer micelles functionalized with sulfonic acid moieties assemble in water to micelles and localize the catalyst in them. DNA&#8208;aldehyde conjugates were reacted to target heterocycles by micelle&#8208;promoted Povarov&#8208; and Biginelli&#8208;reaction with minimal DNA damage. Strikingly, DNA&#8208;conjugates accumulated effectively in the micellar compartments as a prerequisite for compound synthesis. More information can be found in the Full Paper by R. Weberskirch, A. Brunschweiger, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100980).

Selective incorporation of deuterium into small molecules has emerged as a new challenge to chemists due to an increasing demand for deuterium&#8208;labeled organic molecules. For this purpose, commercial or readily synthesized deuterium donors are employed as easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle reagents for transfer deuteration and hydrodeuteration reactions. Read more about recent advances in the catalytic transfer deuteration and hydrodeuteration for the selective synthesis of deuterated compounds in the Minireview by J.&#8197;R. Clark et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;9988&#8197;ff.

&#8220;DNA Aptaomics&#8221; is reported in this work for finding functional DNA aptamers by a semi&#8208;comprehensive and quantitative single&#8208;round selection using capillary electrophoresis and next generation sequencing according to a selection rule based on analogous sequences. By mining sequence data obtained from sub&#8208;libraries with different DNA conformations, structure&#8208;induced (FRET type) aptamers for thrombin were reasonably selected for the first time.

         <title>Frontispiece: Macrocyclic Complexes Derived from Four cis&#8208;L2Pt Corners and Four Butadiynediyl Linkers; Syntheses, Electronic Structures, and Square versus Skew Rhombus Geometries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 39, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The term &#8220;molecular square&#8221; has been applied to many species, but are they truly planar as a mathematician would require? This work probes this conundrum for a series of Pt4C16 complexes with platinum(II) corners and butadiynediyl or &#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722; edges. In fact, both planar and puckered energy minima are found, both by DFT calculations and crystallographically. Thus, mimicking the grace of a butterfly in flight, these structures can easily transit between extended and folded geometries. For more details see the Full Paper by J.&#8197;A. Gladysz, M.&#8197;B. Hall et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;10021&#8197;ff.

         <title>Front Cover: Synthesis of Difluoroglycine Derivatives from Amines, Difluorocarbene, and CO2: Computational Design, Scope, and Applications (Chem. Eur. J. 39/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 39, Page 9961-9961, July 12, 2021. </description>

An Artificial Force Induced Reaction (AFIR) on a super computer has led to a new three&#8208;component reaction (3CR) of amines, difluorocarbene, and the inexpensive and non&#8208;toxic C1 source CO2. This reaction produces a broad range of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroglycine derivatives that are bioisosteres of natural glycine. The versatility of these products is very broad; i.e., they can be used as new difluorocarbene sources, substrates for radical substitution reactions, and precursors for new NHC ligands. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Maeda, T. Mita et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100812).

Synthesis of dipyrrolyldiketone PtII complexes, as phosphorescence anion&#8208;responsive &#960;&#8208;electronic molecules, was motivated by the chemistry of previously investigated boron complexes. The PtII complexes displayed solid&#8208;state ion&#8208;pairing assemblies, exhibiting various anion&#8208;binding modes, derived from pyrrole&#8208;inverted and pyrrole&#8208;non&#8208;inverted conformations, and packing structures, with the contribution of charge&#8208;by&#8208;charge assemblies.

         <title>A Showcase of Green Chemistry: Sustainable Synthetic Approach of Zirconium&#8208;Based MOF Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 39, Page 9967-9987, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The production and application of Zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework materials are restricted by numerous factors. By embracing green chemistry, green raw materials and green synthesis methods are the keys in sustainable synthesis of Zr&#8722;MOFs over last decade. This review summarizes the achievements and looks forward to the future industrialization and commercialization of Zr&#8722;MOFs.







Abstract
Zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework materials (Zr&#8722;MOFs) have more practical usage over most conventional benchmark porous materials and even many other MOFs due to the excellent structural stability, rich coordination forms, and various active sites. However, their mass&#8208;production and application are restricted by the high&#8208;cost raw materials, complex synthesis procedures, harsh reaction conditions, and unexpected environmental impact. Based on the principles of &#8220;Green Chemistry&#8221;, considerable efforts have been done for breaking through the limitations, and significant progress has been made in the sustainable synthesis of Zr&#8722;MOFs over the past decade. In this review, the advancements of green raw materials and green synthesis methods in the synthesis of Zr&#8722;MOFs are reviewed, along with the corresponding drawbacks. The challenges and prospects are discussed and outlooked, expecting to provide guidance for the acceleration of the industrialization and commercialization of Zr&#8722;MOFs.

In recent years, catalytic transfer deuteration and hydrodeuteration techniques are emerging as powerful methods for the selective installation of deuterium into small molecules. In this minireview, recent advances for the application of these reactions in the selective deuteration of alkenes and alkynes are discussed.







Abstract
Increasing demand for deuterium&#8208;labeled organic molecules has spurred a renewed interest in selective methods for deuterium installation. Catalytic transfer deuteration and transfer hydrodeuteration are emerging as powerful techniques for the selective incorporation of deuterium into small molecules. These reactions not only obviate the use of D2 gas and pressurized reaction setups but provide new opportunities for selectively installing deuterium into small molecules. Commercial or readily synthesized deuterium donors are typically employed as easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle reagents for transfer deuteration and hydrodeuteration reactions. In this minireview, recent advances in the catalytic transfer deuteration and hydrodeuteration of alkenes and alkynes for the selective synthesis of deuterated alkanes will be discussed.

         <title>Enantiopure Polyradical Tetrahedral Pd12L6 Cages</title>

Polyradical captured in a cage: Chiral polyradical PdII tetrahedral cages supported by tris(imido)phosphate trianions and diradical dhbq&#8226;&#8226;2&#8722; linkers were synthesized. DFT calculations show that these cages exhibit integer spin states and ferromagnetic exchange between the adjacent radical bridges via the PdII atoms. This work provides insights into the design and synthesis of stable cage frameworks with potential in the areas of spin&#8208;electronic devices and catalysis.







Abstract
The synthesis of cages with a polyradical framework remains a challenging task. Herein is reported an enantiomeric pair of quinoid&#8208;bridged polyradical tetrahedral palladium(II) cages that are stabilized by an unusual dianionic diradical form (dhbq..2&#8722;). These cages have been characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance and UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy, squid magnetometry and mass spectrometry. Single&#8208;crystal&#8208;derived X&#8208;ray investigations of the iso&#8208;structural cages built on fluoranilate linkers confirm the tetrahedral structure of the obtained radical cages. Theoretical calculations showed that the diradical state of the dhbq anions is more stable than the usual monoradical state. A weak ferromagnetic exchange between adjacent radical centers was observed in DFT studies.

         <title>Spotlight on the Effect of Electrolyte Composition on the Potential of Maximum Entropy: Supporting Electrolytes Are Not Always Inert</title>

Gold standards: By determining the potential of maximum entropy (PME) with the laser&#8208;induced current transient technique, the influence of the electrolyte composition on polycrystalline gold has been systematically investigated. Increasing the electrolyte pH and purging O2 shift the PME to more positive potentials. The electric double&#8208;layer structure for Aupc in solutions containing Na+ and K+ ions is vastly different when electrolyte pH reaches six or higher. This method enables another approach for the interpretation of interfacial electrocatalytic processes.







Abstract
The influence of electrolyte pH, the presence of alkali metal cations (Na+, K+), and the presence of O2 on the interfacial water structure of polycrystalline gold electrodes has been experimentally studied in detail. The potential of maximum entropy (PME) was determined by the laser&#8208;induced current transient (LICT) technique. Our results demonstrate that increasing the electrolyte pH and introducing O2 shift the PME to more positive potentials. Interestingly, the PME exhibits a higher sensitivity to the pH change in the presence of K+ than Na+. Altering the pH of the K2SO4 solution from 4 to 6 can cause a drastic shift in the PME. These findings reveal that, for example, K2SO4 and Na2SO4 cannot be considered as equal supporting electrolytes: it is not a viable assumption. This can likely be extrapolated to other common &#8220;inert&#8221; supporting electrolytes. Beyond this, knowledge about the near&#8208;ideal electrolyte composition can be used to optimize electrochemical devices such as electrolyzers, fuel cells, batteries, and supercapacitors.

Electron poor, but rich in possibility: Electron&#8208;deficient diindenopyrazines with different aryl substituents have been synthesized and characterized. The introduction of electron&#8208;poor aryl groups reduces the electron affinity to &#8722;4&#8197;eV, thereby making the compounds attractive as n&#8208;semiconductors. Tested in an organic field&#8208;effect transistor, compound 4&#8201;e showed electron mobilities up to 0.037&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
The syntheses, properties and application of the air&#8208;stable electron acceptors, diindenopyrazines 4&#8201;a&#8211;g are reported demonstrating the introduction of functional aryl groups in the 6&#8208; and 12&#8208;positions. The targets are accessible on the hundred milligram to gram scale. The structure of the aryl groups in 4&#8201;a&#8211;g modulates their solubility, redox potentials and optical properties. The introduction of electron&#8208;poor aryl groups to the electron&#8208;poor diindenopyrazine backbone reduces the electron affinity to &#8722;4&#8197;eV, making the compounds attractive as n&#8208;semiconductors. A simple organic field&#8208;effect transistor of 4&#8201;e &#8211;without optimization&#8211; shows electron transport with a mobility of up to 0.037&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.

         <title>Isolation of a Uranium(III)&#8208;Carbon Multiple Bond Complex</title>

U(III)=C double bond: The first authentic isolable mononuclear U(III)&#8722;C double bond complex and a U(IV) analogue have been synthesized and fully characterized. Single&#8208;crystal structure analysis revealed that the U(III)=C bond is elongated by ca. 0.18&#8197;&#197; when compared to the U(IV)=C bond. DFT calculations revealed that the tridentate carbodiphosphorane (CDP) ligand served as a double donor towards uranium, forming polarized &#963; and &#960; dative bonds.







Abstract
Low&#8208;valent uranium&#8208;element multiple bond complexes remain scarce, though there is burgeoning interest regarding to their bonding and reactivity. Herein, isolation of a uranium(III)&#8208;carbon double bond complex [(Cp*)2U(CDP)](BPh4) (1) comprising a tridentate carbodiphosphorane (CDP) was reported for the first time. Oxidation of 1 afforded the corresponding U(IV) complex [(Cp*)2U(CDP)](BPh4)2 (2). The distance between U and C in 2 is 2.481&#8197;&#197;, indicating the existence of a typical U=C double bond, which is further confirmed by quantum chemical calculations. Bonding analysis suggested that the CDP also serves as both &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;donor in complex 1, though a longer U&#8722;C bond (2.666(3)&#8197;&#197;) is observed. It implies that 1 is the first isolable mononuclear uranium(III) carbene complex. Moreover, these results suggest that CDPs are promising ligands to establish other low&#8208;valent f&#8208;block metal&#8208;carbon multiple bond complexes.

         <title>Driving the Emission Towards Blue by Controlling the HOMO&#8208;LUMO Energy Gap in BF2&#8208;Functionalized 2&#8208;(Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phenols</title>

Blue emissive materials: boron containing fluorescent compounds have been prepared starting from imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine phenols. Large Stokes shift, high absolute quantum yields and good photostability are observed in solution. TD&#8208;DFT calculations allowed to find a linear correlation between the HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap of these compounds and the Hammett constants of substituents R para to the hydroxyl group of the phenols.







Abstract
Several boron compounds with 2&#8208;(imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phenols, differentiated by the nature of the substituent (R) in the para position of the hydroxy group, have been synthesized and thoroughly characterized both in solution (1H, 13C, 11B, 19F NMR) and in the solid state (X&#8208;ray). All derivatives displayed attractive photophysical properties like very high Stokes shift, high fluorescence quantum yields and a good photostability in solution. Time&#8208;Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations allowed to define the main electronic transitions as intra ligand transitions (1ILT), which was corroborated by the Natural Transition Orbitals (NTOs) shapes. The HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap was correlated to the electronic properties of the substituent R on the phenolic ring, as quantified by its &#963;p Hammett constant.

A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted, room temperature and redox neutral direct C&#8722;H amination of glycine and peptides has been firstly accomplished by using N&#8208;acyloxyphthalimide or &#8208;succinimide as nitrogen&#8208;radical precursor.

         <title>Native Chemical Ligation&#8208;Based Fluorescent Probes for Cysteine and Aminopeptidase N Using meso&#8208;thioester&#8208;BODIPY</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluorogenic conversion of a meso&#8208;thioester to meso&#8208;amide BODIPY dye was exploited in the construction of fluorescent &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; probes relying on the native chemical ligation reaction mechanism. Two fluorogenic probes, 1&#8201;a and 4, derived from a meso&#8208;thioester&#8208;BODIPY scaffold, were designed, and successfully applied for the selective detection of cysteine (1&#8201;a) and aminopeptidase N (4), respectively.







Abstract
meso&#8208;Carboxyl&#8208;BODIPY responds to small electronic changes resulting from acyl substitution reactions with a marked change in fluorescence. Herein, the minute changes that accompany the thioester to amide conversion encountered in native chemical ligation (NCL) are exploited in the construction of fluorescent &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; probes. Two fluorogenic probes, 1&#8201;a and 4, derived from a meso&#8208;thioester&#8208;BODIPY scaffold, were designed for the selective detection of cysteine (1&#8201;a) and aminopeptidase N (4), respectively. The aromatic (1&#8201;a) and aliphatic (4) thioesters of meso&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;BODIPY are nonfluorescent. However, specific analyte&#8208;induced conversion to the meso&#8208;amide derivative caused significant spectral changes and a dramatic fluorescence enhancement. Probe 1&#8201;a exhibited a large fluorescence &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; response with high selectivity toward cysteine via a tandem NCL reaction.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The fluorogenic&lt;/b&gt; conversion of a &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-thioester to &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-amide BODIPY dye was exploited in the construction of fluorescent &#8220;turn-on&#8221; probes relying on the native chemical ligation reaction mechanism. Two fluorogenic probes, &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;, derived from a &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-thioester-BODIPY scaffold, were designed, and successfully applied for the selective detection of cysteine (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;) and aminopeptidase N (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;), respectively.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-Carboxyl-BODIPY responds to small electronic changes resulting from acyl substitution reactions with a marked change in fluorescence. Herein, the minute changes that accompany the thioester to amide conversion encountered in native chemical ligation (NCL) are exploited in the construction of fluorescent &#8220;turn-on&#8221; probes. Two fluorogenic probes, &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;, derived from a &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-thioester-BODIPY scaffold, were designed for the selective detection of cysteine (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;) and aminopeptidase N (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;), respectively. The aromatic (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;) and aliphatic (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) thioesters of &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-carboxyl-BODIPY are nonfluorescent. However, specific analyte-induced conversion to the &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-amide derivative caused significant spectral changes and a dramatic fluorescence enhancement. Probe &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; exhibited a large fluorescence &#8220;turn-on&#8221; response with high selectivity toward cysteine via a tandem NCL reaction. Probe &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; was successfully applied to the monitoring and imaging of endogenous aminopeptidase N in live cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Crystal Structures of AlCr2 and MoSi2: Same Structure Type vs. Different Bonding Pattern</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hidden crystals: With a modified synthesis approach and micro&#8208;fabrication technique, it was possible to isolate micrometer&#8208;sized single crystals of AlCr2 from a largely polycrystalline sample. Chemical bond analysis shows close relation to elements, in contrast to a quite localized bonding pattern in the prototype, MoSi2.







Abstract
In a joint effort utilizing modified sample preparation, microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction and micro&#8208;fabrication, it became possible to prepare single crystals of the &#8220;hidden&#8221; phase AlCr2. High&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis is described in detail for two crystals with the similar overall composition, but different degree of disorder, which seems to be the main cause for the differing unit cell parameters. Chemical bonding analysis of AlCr2 in comparison to prototypical MoSi2 shows pronounced differences reflecting the interchange of main group element vs. transition metal as majority component.

         <title>Infrared Responsive Choline Phosphate Lipids for Synergistic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spot on: A light&#8208;inducible Lip&#8208;cRGDfk/ICG/Dox liposome simultaneously loads a water&#8208;soluble drug (Dox) and photothermal transduction agents (ICG), targets the tumor site, and locally heats it up under external laser irradiation. Due to the conformational transformation of CP lipids, the anticancer drug Dox is released at a specific time and in a specific space to kill tumor cells. This brings about a combination of chemotherapy and photothermal therapy for the noninvasive treatment of tumors.







Abstract
Choline phosphate lipids have been designed and developed as new&#8208;generation zwitterionic nanocarriers with excellent biocompatibility and bioorthogonality to provide a more programmable performance for cancer therapy. However, there is a lack of spatiotemporal and reversible control for drug release at target tumor cells, which can lead to severe adverse effects to normal tissue and discounted treatment outcome. Here, light&#8208;inducible Lip&#8208;cRGDfk/ICG/Dox liposomes were developed for synergistic cancer therapy. ICG can effectively convert light energy into selective heating in a local environment upon laser irradiation, thus inducing thermal ablation of tumor cells, and further reversibly trigger the spatiotemporal release of anticancer drugs (Dox) at tumor cells due to the conformation transformation of CP lipids to synergistically kill tumor cells. That Lip&#8208;cRGDfk/ICG/Dox exhibited a significant improvement for breast cancer therapy in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo is also demonstrated, thus it can serve as an efficient platform to noninvasively and spatiotemporally control the activation of cytotoxicity at tumor cells for precision cancer therapy.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of Highly Fluorescent and CPL&#8208;Active Dispiroindeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helicenes are intriguing and inherently chiral compounds with fascinating 3D architecture. Their shape could be compared to whirlpools in the Naruto Strait (&#40180;&#38272;&#12398;&#28198;&#28526;), as it is beautifully depicted in the famous woodcut by Hiroshige. Formation of the whirlpools requires special conditions and these are also required in helical compounds&#8217; syntheses. Synthesis of chiral fluorescent [7]helical indenofluorenes by using catalytic enantioselective [2+2+2]cyclotrimerization and their photophysical properties are reported. More information can be found in the Communication by D. Ne&#269;as, M. Kotora, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100759).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chromium based single&#8208;site catalysts allow the production of ultra&#8208;high molecular weight polyethylene with very high productivities. The picture shows a donor&#8208;functionalised indenyl chromium catalyst in action where a strong electron&#8208;donating substituent leads to an increase in catalytic activity and co&#8208;monomer incorporation. The correlation between donor strength, electronic and catalytic properties was studied systematically. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M. Enders et&#8197;al.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The molecular level description of carbohydrate assemblies is hampered by their structural complexity and the lack of suitable analytical methods. Here, we employed systematic chemical modifications to identify key non&#8208;covalent interactions that triggered the supramolecular assembly of a disaccharide model. While some modifications disrupted the supramolecular organization, others were tolerated, delivering important information on the aggregation process. The screening identified new geometries, including nanotubes, and twisted ribbons that were characterized with electron tomography and electron diffraction (ED) methods. This work demonstrates that the combination of synthetic chemistry and ED&#8208;methods is a powerful tool to draw correlations between the molecular structure and the nanoscale architecture of carbohydrate assemblies.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative Distinction between Noble Metals Located in Mesopores from those on the External Surface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We compare three methods for quantitatively distinguishing the location of noble metals (NM) in mesopores from those found on the external particle surface. MCM&#8208;41 and SBA&#8208;15 with NM either preferentially located in mesopores or on the external surface were prepared and characterized by TEM. We quantified arylphosphines forming complexes with NM by  31  P MAS NMR spectroscopy. Phosphine/NM ratios drop from 2.0 to 0.2 when increasing the probe diameter from 1.08 to 1.54 nm. The reaction between NM and triphenylphosphine (TPP) within 3.0 nm MCM&#8208;41 pores takes due to confinement effects multiple weeks. In contrast, external NM react with TPP instantly. A promising method is filling the pores using the pore volume impregnation technique with tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS). TPP loading revealed that 66% of NM are located on the external surface of MCM&#8208;41. The pore filling method can be used in association with any probe molecule, also for the quantification of acid sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Making Aromatic Phosphorus Heterocycles more Basic and Nucleophilic: Synthesis, Characterization and Reactivity of the First Phosphinine Selenide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and isolation of a phosphinine selenide was achieved for the first time by reacting red selenium with 2,6&#8208;bis(trimethylsilyl)phosphinine. The rather large coupling constant of  1  J  P,Se  = 883 Hz is in line with a P&#8208;Se bond of high  s  &#8208;character. The &#963;&#8208;electron donating Me  3  Si&#8208;substituents significantly increase the energy of the phosphorus lone pair and hence its basicity, making the heterocycle considerably more basic and nucleophilic than the unsubstituted phosphinine C  5  H  5  P, as confirmed by the calculated gas phase basicities. NBO calculations further reveal that the lone pairs of the selenium atom are stabilized through donor&#8208;acceptor interactions with antibonding orbitals of the aromatic ring. Our results pave the way for new perspectives in the chemistry of phosphorus in low coordination.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Self&#8208;Assembly of Gold Nanoparticles Based on Co&#8208;Functionalization with Zwitterionic and Cationic Binding Motifs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a pH&#8208; and temperature&#8208;controlled reversible self&#8208;assembly of Au&#8208;nanoparticles (AuNPs) in water, based on their surface modification with cationic guanidiniocarbonyl pyrrole (GCP) and zwitterionic guanidiniocarbonyl pyrrole carboxylate (GCPZ) binding motifs. When both binding motifs are installed in a carefully balanced ratio, the resulting functionalized AuNPs self&#8208;assemble at pH 1, pH 7 and pH 13, whereas they disassemble at pH 3 and pH 11. Further disassembly can be achieved at elevated temperatures at pH 1 and pH 13. Thus, we were able to prepare functionalized nanoparticles that can be assembled/disassembled in seven alternating regimes, simply controlled by pH and temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to Indole&#8208;Fused Benzannulated Medium&#8208;Sized Rings through a Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Cyclization of Azido&#8208;Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Golden keys close the loop: Starting from phenylene&#8208;tethered azido&#8208;alkynes, pharmaceutically relevant indole&#8208;fused benzannulated eight&#8208;membered rings were constructed by exploiting &#945;&#8208;imino gold(I) carbenes as key intermediates for the gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction. The necessity of the C&#8208;dtbm ligand for the cyclization to a more challenging nine&#8208;membered ring is also demonstrated.







Abstract
Because benzannulated and indole&#8208;fused medium&#8208;sized rings are found in many bioactive compounds, combining these fragments might lead to unexplored areas of biologically relevant and uncovered chemical space. Herein is shown that &#945;&#8208;imino gold carbene chemistry can play an important role in solving the difficulty in the formation of medium&#8208;sized rings. Namely, phenylene&#8208;tethered azido&#8208;alkynes undergo arylative cyclization through the formation of a gold carbene intermediate to afford benzannulated indole&#8208;fused medium&#8208;sized tetracycles. The reactions allow a range of different aryl substitution patterns and efficient access to these otherwise difficult&#8208;to&#8208;obtain medium&#8208;sized rings. This study also demonstrates the feasibility of the semihollow&#8208;shaped C&#8208;dtbm ligand for the construction of a nine&#8208;membered ring.

         <title>Direct Visualization of Substitutional Li Doping in Supported Pt Nanoparticles and Their Ultra&#8208;selective Catalytic Hydrogenation Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct &#8216;substitution&#8217; of Pt with subLi in atomic columns by electron ptychography images with characteristic contraction in lattice parameters from advanced materials characterization is observed for the first time. The electron donation of d&#8208;band of Pt without higher orbital hybridizations by subLi offers an alternative way for ultra&#8208;selectivity in catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds with detainment of facile CO bond to alcohols.







Abstract
It has only recently been established that doping light elements (lithium, boron, and carbon) into supported transition metals can fill interstitial sites, which can be observed by the expanded unit cell. As an example, interstitial lithium (intLi) can block H filling octahedral interstices of palladium metal lattice, which improves partial hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes under hydrogen. In contrast, herein, we report intLi is not found in the case of Pt/C. Instead, we observe for the first time a direct &#8216;substitution&#8217; of Pt with substitutional lithium (subLi) in alternating atomic columns using scanning transmission electron microscopy&#8208;annular dark field (STEM&#8208;ADF). This ordered substitutional doping results in a contraction of the unit cell as shown by high&#8208;quality synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction (SXRD). The electron donation of d&#8208;band of Pt without higher orbital hybridizations by subLi offers an alternative way for ultra&#8208;selectivity in catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds by suppressing the facile CO bond breakage that would form alcohols.

         <title>Heterodinuclear Zn(II), Mg(II) or Co(III) with Na(I) Catalysts for Carbon Dioxide and Cyclohexene Oxide Ring Opening Copolymerizations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heterodinuclear M/Na catalysts for cyclohexene oxide and carbon dioxide copolymerization are reported. The best catalyst comprises Co(III)/Na(I), coordinated by the macrocyclic ligand, and showing activity and selectivity values at the upper end of reported values for 1&#8197;bar carbon dioxide pressure copolymerizations. These catalysts operated without co&#8208;catalyst and maintain high activity at low loadings.







Abstract
A series heterodinuclear catalysts, operating without co&#8208;catalyst, show good performances for the ring opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of cyclohexene oxide and carbon dioxide. The complexes feature a macrocyclic ligand designed to coordinate metals such as Zn(II), Mg(II) or Co(III), in a Schiff base &#8216;pocket&#8217;, and Na(I) in a modified crown&#8208;ether binding &#8216;pocket&#8217;. The 11 new catalysts are used to explore the influences of the metal combinations and ligand backbones over catalytic activity and selectivity. The highest performance catalyst features the Co(III)Na(I) combination, [N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(3,3&#8217;&#8208;triethylene glycol salicylidene)&#8208;1,2&#8208;ethylenediamino cobalt(III) di(acetate)]sodium (7), and it shows both excellent activity and selectivity at 1&#8197;bar carbon dioxide pressure (TOF=1590&#8197;h&#8722;1, &gt;99&#8201;% polymer selectivity, 1&#8201;:&#8201;10: 4000, 100&#8201;&#176;C), as well as high activity at higher carbon dioxide pressure (TOF=4343&#8197;h&#8722;1, 20&#8197;bar, 1&#8201;:&#8201;10&#8201;:&#8201;25000). Its rate law shows a first order dependence on both catalyst and cyclohexene oxide concentrations and a zeroth order for carbon dioxide pressure, over the range 10&#8211;40&#8197;bar. These new catalysts eliminate any need for ionic or Lewis base co&#8208;catalyst and instead exploit the coordination of earth&#8208;abundant and inexpensive Na(I) adjacent to a second metal to deliver efficient catalysis. They highlight the potential for well&#8208;designed ancillary ligands and inexpensive Group 1 metals to deliver high performance heterodinuclear catalysts for carbon dioxide copolymerizations and, in future, these catalysts may also show promise in other alternating copolymerization and carbon dioxide utilizations.

Energy efficiency and electrocatalysts: Modulating Pt&#8208;group metals (PGMs) by means of anion engineering possesses high flexibility to regulate the electronic structure, which can effectively improve the PGM compounds&#8242; activity and reduce the use of noble metals. This review looks at the origin of the electrochemical activity of anion&#8208;modulated PGM compounds and systematically summarizes the progress of their synthetic strategies and applications in energy&#8208;relevant electrocatalysis to date.







Abstract
Pt&#8208;group metal (PGM) electrocatalysts with unique electronic structures and irreplaceable comprehensive properties play crucial roles in electrocatalysis. Anion engineering can create a series of PGM compounds (such as RuP2, IrP2, PtP2, RuB2, Ru2B3, RuS2, etc.) that provide a promising prospect for improving the electrocatalytic performance and use of Pt&#8208;group noble metals. This review seeks the electrochemical activity origin of anion&#8208;modulated PGM compounds, and systematically analyzes and summarizes their synthetic strategies and energy&#8208;relevant applications in electrocatalysis. Orientation towards the sustainable development of nonfossil resources has stimulated a blossoming interest in the design of advanced electrocatalysts for clean energy conversion. The anion&#8208;modulated strategy for Pt&#8208;group metals (PGMs) by means of anion engineering possesses high flexibility to regulate the electronic structure, providing a promising prospect for constructing electrocatalysts with superior activity and stability to satisfy a future green electrochemical energy conversion system. Based on the previous work of our group and others, this review summarizes the up&#8208;to&#8208;date progress on anion&#8208;modulated PGM compounds (such as RuP2, IrP2, PtP2, RuB2, Ru2B3, RuS2, etc.) in energy&#8208;related electrocatalysis from the origin of their activity and synthetic strategies to electrochemical applications including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), N2 reduction reaction (NRR), and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). At the end, the key problems, countermeasures and future development orientations of anion&#8208;modulated PGM compounds toward electrocatalytic applications are proposed.

It exhibits two independent interpenetrating three&#8208;dimensional (3D) B&#8722;O anion networks constructed by [B8O17] groups, only a few borates present the interpenetrating 3D framework, enriching the structural diversity of B&#8722;O configurations.

         <title>The CdIn2S4/WO3 Nanosheet Composite Has a Significantly Enhanced Photo&#8208;electrochemical Cathodic Protection Performance and Excellent Electron Storage Capability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;electrochemical cathodic protection technology is considered to be a green metallic corrosion protection technology that uses solar energy to protect against corrosion without consuming any anode materials. A CdIn2S4/WO3 nanosheet composite film with electron self&#8208;storage properties was synthesized and used as a photoelectrode to couple with metallic materials to provide photo&#8208;electrochemical cathodic protection under light illumination and continuing cathodic protection in the dark. This research will promote the practical application of photo&#8208;electrochemical cathodic protection technology. The CdIn2S4/WO3 nanosheet composite has a significantly enhanced photo&#8208;electrochemical cathodic protection performance and excellent electron storage capability (Chen et&#8197;al. at the Chinese Academy of Sciences)







Abstract
Photo&#8208;electrochemical cathodic protection (CP) technology is considered to be a green metallic corrosion protection technology that uses solar energy to protect from corrosion and does not consume any anode materials. In this work, a CdIn2S4/WO3 nanocomposite photoelectrode was prepared, and its photo&#8208;electrochemical CP performance and mechanism were studied and analyzed. WO3 has a well band matching with CdIn2S4, leading to a significantly enhanced photo&#8208;electrochemical CP performance of the nanocomposite. Meanwhile, as confirmed in this work, the CdIn2S4/WO3 nanocomposite can store photoinduced electrons under light illumination through intercalation reactions and changing the valence state of tungsten. Moreover, it can discharge in the dark state to provide continuous CP for the coupled metals. This research will promote the practical application process of the photo&#8208;electrochemical CP technology.

&lt;p&gt;Photo-electrochemical cathodic protection technology is considered to be a green metallic corrosion protection technology that uses solar energy to protect against corrosion without consuming any anode materials. A CdIn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheet composite film with electron self-storage properties was synthesized and used as a photoelectrode to couple with metallic materials to provide photo-electrochemical cathodic protection under light illumination and continuing cathodic protection in the dark. This research will promote the practical application of photo-electrochemical cathodic protection technology. The CdIn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheet composite has a significantly enhanced photo-electrochemical cathodic protection performance and excellent electron storage capability (Chen et&#8197;al. at the Chinese Academy of Sciences)

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photo-electrochemical cathodic protection (CP) technology is considered to be a green metallic corrosion protection technology that uses solar energy to protect from corrosion and does not consume any anode materials. In this work, a CdIn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanocomposite photoelectrode was prepared, and its photo-electrochemical CP performance and mechanism were studied and analyzed. WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has a well band matching with CdIn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, leading to a significantly enhanced photo-electrochemical CP performance of the nanocomposite. Meanwhile, as confirmed in this work, the CdIn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanocomposite can store photoinduced electrons under light illumination through intercalation reactions and changing the valence state of tungsten. Moreover, it can discharge in the dark state to provide continuous CP for the coupled metals. This research will promote the practical application process of the photo-electrochemical CP technology.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Differentiation of Epoxide Enantiomers in the Confined Spaces of an Homochiral Cu(II) Metal&#8208;Organic Framework by Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The homochiral metal&#8208;organic framework TAMOF&#8208;1 was used as a heterogeneous catalyst in the kinetic resolution of styrene oxide by ring opening reactions with anilines. The linear products underwent a second KR resulting in an amplification of the final stereoselectivity (subtractive Horeau amplification effect). Computational studies rationalized the two successive KR while providing a deep understanding of the process.







Abstract
TAMOF&#8208;1, a homochiral metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) constructed from an amino acid derivative and Cu(II), was investigated as a heterogeneous catalyst in kinetic resolutions involving the ring opening of styrene oxide with a set of anilines. The branched products generated from the ring opening of styrene oxide with anilines and the unreacted epoxide were obtained with moderately high enantiomeric excesses. The linear product arising from the attack on the non&#8208;benzylic position of styrene oxide underwent a second kinetic resolution by reacting with the epoxide, resulting in an amplification of its final enantiomeric excess and a concomitant formation of an array of isomeric aminodiols. Computational studies confirmed the experimental results, providing a deep understanding of the whole process involving the two successive kinetic resolutions. Furthermore, TAMOF&#8208;1 activity was conserved after several catalytic cycles. The ring opening of a meso&#8208;epoxide with aniline catalyzed by TAMOF&#8208;1 was also studied and moderate enantioselectivities were obtained.

         <title>Impact of Pore Size and Defects on the Selective Adsorption of Acetylene in Alkyne&#8208;Functionalized Nickel(II)&#8208;Pyrazolate&#8208;Based MOFs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust defective nickel(II) pyrazolate&#8208;based MOFs, bearing alkyne moieties on the organic spacers have been explored for C2H2/CO2 separation. As proven by static and dynamic gas adsorption and computational modelling the non&#8208;defective34 systems give rise to selective interactions with C2H2 over CO2 as a result of a mixture of pore confinement and H&#8208;bonding and alkyne&#8208;alkyne interactions. Creation of defects is responsible for strong interactions of cluster basic sites and extraframework potassium cations with CO2 with a concomitant lowering of C2H2 over CO2 selectivity.







Abstract
C2H2/CO2 separation is a highly challenging process as a consequence of their similar physicochemical properties. In this work we have explored, by static and dynamic gas sorption techniques and computational modelling, the suitability of a series of two isoreticular robust Ni(II)pyrazolate&#8208;based MOFs, bearing alkyne moieties on the ligand backbones, for C2H2/CO2 separation. The results are consistent with high adsorption capacity and selectivity of the essayed systems towards C2H2 molecules. Furthermore, a post&#8208;synthetic treatment with KOH ethanolic solution gives rise to linker vacancy defects and incorporation of extraframework potassium ions. Creation of defects is responsible for increased adsorption capacity for both gases, however, strong interactions of the cluster basic sites and extraframework potassium cations with CO2 molecules are responsible for a lowering of C2H2 over CO2 selectivity.

         <title>Ultradoping Boron on Si(100) via Solvothermal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultradoping introduces unprecedented dopant levels into Si, which transforms its electronic behaviour and enables its use as a next&#8208;generation electronic material. Commercialization of ultradoping is currently limited by gas&#8208;phase ultra&#8208;high vacuum requirements. Solvothermal chemistry is amenable to scale&#8208;up; however, an integral part of ultradoping is a direct chemical bond between dopants and Si and solvothermal dopant&#8208;Si surface reactions are not well&#8208;developed. This work provides the first quantified demonstration of achieving the ultradoping concentrations of Boron (~1e14 cm 2 ) using a solvothermal process. Surface characterization indicate the catalyst cross&#8208;reacted, which led to multiple surface products and caused ambiguity in experimental confirmation of direct surface attachment. Density functional theory computations elucidate that the reaction results in direct B&#8208;Si surface bonds. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle work lays groundwork for emerging solvothermal ultradoping processes</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Synchrotron X&#8208;ray Diffraction Studies of the Mechanochemical Synthesis of ZnS from its Elements</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed in&#8197;situ investigation of the mechanosynthesis of the hexagonal ZnS modification (wurtzite) from its elements combining synchrotron powder diffraction and pressure measurements is presented. In addition, the subsequent phase transition from the hexagonal to the cubic structure (sphalerite) was investigated and the kinetics was explored.







Abstract
Mechanochemistry, as a synthesis tool for inorganic materials, became an ever&#8208;growing field in material chemistry. The direct energy transfer by collision of the educts with the milling media gives the possibility to design environmental&#8208;friendly reactions. Nevertheless, the underlying process of energy transfer and hence the kinetics of mechanosynthesis remain unclear. Herein, we present in&#8197;situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction studies coupled with pressure measurements performed during the formation of ZnS and the subsequent phase transition (PT) from the hexagonal to the cubic modification. Milling Zn and S8 results in the sublimation of S8, observed by a sudden pressure increase. Simultaneously, the hexagonal metastable ZnS&#8208;modification (wurtzite) forms. Via detection of the pressure maximum, the exact start of the wurtzite formation can be determined. Immediately after the formation of wurtzite, the structural PT to the thermodynamic stable cubic modification sphalerite takes place. This PT can be described by the Prout&#8208;Tompkins equation for autocatalytic reactions, similar to thermally induced PT in sulfur vapor at high temperatures (T&gt;1133&#8197;K). The increase in the reactivity of the wurtzite formation is explained by the reaction in sulfur vapor and the induction of defect structures by the collisions with the milling media.

         <title>Monitoring the Structure Evolution of Titanium Oxide Photocatalysts: From the Molecular Form via the Amorphous State to the Crystalline Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation mechanism of amorphous TixOy photocatalysts was studied by X&#8208;ray total scattering experiments and subsequent PDF analysis starting from titanium(IV) ethoxide precursor. Effects of the colour change upon UV illumination on the local Ti environment were investigated by PDF analysis and EELS. Transformation of amorphous TixOy to anatase&#8208;TiO2 by calcination was further examined by in&#8197;situ temperature dependent experiments.







Abstract
Amorphous TixOy with high surface area has attracted significant interest as photocatalyst with higher activity in ultraviolet (UV) light&#8208;induced water splitting applications compared to commercial nanocrystalline TiO2. Under photocatalytic operation conditions, the structure of the molecular titanium alkoxide precursor rearranges upon hydrolysis and leads to higher connectivity of the structure&#8208;building units. Structurally ordered domains with sizes smaller than 7&#8197;&#197; form larger aggregates. The experimental scattering data can be explained best with a structure model consisting of an anatase&#8208;like core and a distorted shell. Upon exposure to UV light, the white TixOy suspension turns dark corresponding to the reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+ as confirmed by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). Heat&#8208;induced crystallisation was followed by in&#8197;situ temperature&#8208;dependent total scattering experiments. First, ordering in the Ti&#8722;O environment takes place upon to 350&#8201;&#176;C. Above this temperature, the distorted anatase core starts to grow but the structure obtained at 400&#8201;&#176;C is still not fully ordered.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The formation mechanism&lt;/b&gt; of amorphous Ti&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; photocatalysts was studied by X-ray total scattering experiments and subsequent PDF analysis starting from titanium(IV) ethoxide precursor. Effects of the colour change upon UV illumination on the local Ti environment were investigated by PDF analysis and EELS. Transformation of amorphous Ti&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; to anatase-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by calcination was further examined by in&#8197;situ temperature dependent experiments.

         <title>Saddle&#8208;Shaped Building Blocks: A New Concept for Designing Fully Conjugated 3D Organic Semiconducting Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconductors design: Cyclooctatetraene (COT) and its derivatives are &#960;&#8208;conjugated with saddle&#8208;shaped 3D architecture. They would be candidate as building blocks for constructing fully conjugated 3D materials that can facilitate the electron layer&#8208;layer delocalization and transport. We highlight recent conceptual progresses on the design and properties of fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated 3D organic semiconducting materials based on the COT derivatives, which could give inspiration for designing next generation organic semiconductors.







Abstract
Currently, most organic semiconducting materials (OSMs) are &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures in one or two dimension (2D), where the lack of layer&#8208;layer &#960;&#8208;conjugation connection greatly blocks their electron delocalization and transport. The 3D fully conjugated materials could solve this issue because they can provide efficient charge&#8208;transport pathways throughout the whole 3D skeleton, in which the suitable 3D building block is the key to the development of fully conjugated 3D OSMs. Cyclooctatetraene (COT) and its derivatives are good candidates due to their &#960;&#8208;conjugation with 3D saddle&#8208;shaped architecture. In this Concept, we discuss the key features of saddle&#8208;shaped COT&#8208;based derivatives and their synthetic strategy, then we present the current development of using the COT derivatives as building blocks to construct the 3D fully conjugated organic small compound&#8208; and polymer&#8208;based OSMs. The properties and perspectives of these OSMs in photovoltaics, electro&#8208;catalysis and electrical conductivities are also discussed. These recent advances in the developing 3D fully conjugated materials could potentially open up a new frontier in the design of OSMs.

         <title>Glycol Chitosan Functionalized with a Gd(III) Chelate as a Redox&#8208;responsive Magnetic Resonance Imaging Probe to Label Cell Embedding Alginate Capsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Gd(III)&#8208;HPDO3A&#8208;like chelate has been conjugated to glycol&#8208;chitosan through a disulphide bond to obtain a redox&#8208;responsive contrast agent for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), that can be used to label the lumen of alginate&#8208;based cell embedding capsules. The increase of reducing potential within the capsule microenvironment, that is related to hypoxia, can be readily detected by a decrease of MRI contrast enhancement.







Abstract
One possibility for the non&#8208;invasive imaging of encapsulated cell grafts is to label the lumen of cell embedding capsules with a redox&#8208;responsive probe, as an increased extracellular reducing potential can be considered as a marker of hypoxia&#8208;induced necrosis. A Gd(III)&#8208;HPDO3A&#8208;like chelate has been conjugated to glycol&#8208;chitosan through a redox&#8208;responsive disulphide bond to obtain a contrast agent for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Such a compound can be interspersed with fibroblasts within the lumen of alginate&#8208;chitosan capsules. Increasing reducing conditions within the extracellular microenvironment lead to the reductive cleavage of the disulphide bond and to the release of gadolinium in the form of a low molecular weight, non&#8208;ionic chelate. The efflux of such chelate from capsules is readily detected by a decrease of contrast enhancement in T1&#8208;weighted MR images.

         <title>C=C Bond Oxidative Cleavage of BODIPY Photocages by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regioselective oxidative cleavage of a C=C bond from a boron&#8208;dipyrrolemethene (BODIPY) photocage has been realized under 630&#8197;nm illumination; this generated an aldehyde compound and a thiol fluorescent probe. This reaction was demonstrated inside live cells by monitoring the aldehyde release in real time. In particular, the photocage can easily be functionalized with a mannose group so as to acquire the ability to target cancer cells.







Abstract
Photocages for protection and the controlled release of bioactive compounds have been widely investigated. However, the vast majority of these photocages employ the cleavage of single bonds and high&#8208;energy ultraviolet light. The construction of a photoactivation system that uses visible light to cleave unsaturated bonds still remains a challenge. Herein, we report a regioselective oxidative cleavage of C=C bonds from a boron&#8208;dipyrrolemethene (BODIPY)&#8208;based photocage by illumination at 630&#8197;nm, resulting in a free aldehyde and a thiol fluorescent probe. This strategy was demonstrated in live HeLa cells, and the generated &#945;&#8208;formyl&#8208;BODIPY allowed real&#8208;time monitoring of aldehyde release in the cells. In particular, it is shown that a mannose&#8208;functionalized photocage can target HepG2 cells.

         <title>An Optimized Protocol for the Synthesis of Peptides Containing trans&#8208;cyclooctene and Bicyclononyne Dienophiles as Useful Multifunctional Bioorthogonal Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the great advances in solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), the incorporation of certain functional groups into peptide sequences is restricted by the compatibility of the building blocks with conditions used during SPPS. In particular, the introduction of highly reactive groups used in modern bioorthogonal reactions into peptides remains elusive. Here we present an optimized synthetic protocol enabling installation of two strained dienophiles,  trans  &#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) and bicyclononyne (BCN), into different peptide sequences. The two groups enable fast and modular post&#8208;synthetic functionalization of peptides, as we demonstrate in preparation of peptide&#8208;peptide and peptide&#8208;drug conjugates. Due to the excellent biocompatibility, the click&#8208;functionalization of the peptides can be performed directly in live cells. We further show that the introduction of both clickable groups into peptides enables construction of smart, multifunctional probes that can streamline complex chemical biology experiments such as visualization and pull&#8208;down of metabolically labeled glycoconjugates. The presented strategy will find utility in construction of peptides for diverse applications, where high reactivity, efficiency and biocompatibility of the modification step is critical.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective trans&#8208;Hydrostannation of Boron&#8208;Capped Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkynyl&#8208;B(aam) (aam = anthranilamidato) derivatives are bench stable compounds that undergo remarkably selective reactions with Bu  3  SnH in the presence of [Cp*RuCl]  4  as the catalyst. The addition follows an unorthodox  trans  &#8208;selective course; in terms of regioselectivity, the Bu  3  Sn&#8208; unit is delivered&#160; to the C&#8208;atom adjacent to the boracyclic head group.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alkynyl-B(aam) (aam = anthranilamidato) derivatives are bench stable compounds that undergo remarkably selective reactions with Bu  3  SnH in the presence of [Cp*RuCl]  4  as the catalyst. The addition follows an unorthodox  trans  -selective course; in terms of regioselectivity, the Bu  3  Sn- unit is delivered&#160; to the C-atom adjacent to the boracyclic head group. This outcome is deemed to reflect a hydrogen bonding interaction between the protic &#8211;NH groups of the benzo-1,3,2-diazaborininone ring system and the polarized [Ru&#8722;Cl] bond in the loaded catalyst, which locks the substrate in place in a favorable orientation relative to the incoming reagent.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) type exciplex host employing a novel electron transport type (n&#8208;type) host managing positive polarons and stabilizing excitons was developed to elongate the device lifetime of deep blue phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (PhOLEDs). The bipolar n&#8208;type host was designed to prevent hole leakage and secure hole stability while being stabilized under excitons by introducing a CN modified carbazole moiety as a weak donor. The TADF type exciplex host based blue PhOLEDs showed high quantum efficiency above 20% with a deep blue color coordinate of (0.14, 0.16) and elongated device lifetime. The device operational lifetime of the blue PhOLEDs bearing the TADF type exciplex host was extended by more than twice compared to that of the exciplex free unipolar host. This work suggested a design concept of the n&#8208;type host to develop the TADF type exciplex host for deep blue phosphors to reach long lifespan in the deep blue PhOLEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer (PCET) with 1,4&#8208;Bisguanidino&#8208;Benzene Derivatives: Comparative Study and Use in Acid&#8208;Initiated C&#8208;H Activation</title>

         <dc:description>
1,4&#8208;Bisguanidino&#8208;benzenes are versatile reagents in proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions. In this work the effect of guanidino group modification on the PCET reactivity is evaluated (X=H or OMe) and the best performing two compounds applied in intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular aryl&#8208;aryl coupling and oxidative lactonization test reactions. In difference to related reactions with high&#8208;potential benzoquinones, only a small amount of acid is required to inititiate efficient reactions under mild conditions.







Abstract
Proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) is of key importance in modern synthetic chemistry. Redox&#8208;active guanidines were established by our group as valuable alternatives to toxic high&#8208;potential benzoquinones in a variety of different PCET reactions. In this work, the PCET reactivity of a series of 1,4&#8208;bisguanidino&#8208;benzenes varying in their redox potentials and proton affinities is evaluated. The relevant redox and protonation states are fully characterized, and the compounds sorted with respect to their PCET reactivity by comparative PCET experiments supplemented by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Depending on the studied reactions, the driving force is either electron transfer or proton transfer; thereby the influence of both processes on the overall reactivity could be assessed. Then, two of the PCET reagents are applied in representative oxidative aryl&#8208;aryl coupling reactions, namely the intramolecular coupling of 3,3&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;tetramethoxy&#8208;o&#8208;terphenyl to give the corresponding triphenylene, the intermolecular coupling of N&#8208;ethylcarbazole to give N,N&#8217;&#8208;diethyl&#8208;3,3&#8217;&#8208;bicarbazole, and in the oxidative lactonization of 2&#8208;[(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)methyl]&#8208;benzoic acid. Under mild conditions, the reactions proceed fast and efficient. Only small amounts of acid are needed, in clear contrast to the corresponding coupling reactions with traditional high&#8208;potential benzoquinones such as DDQ or chloranil requiring a large excess of a strong acid.

         <title>Bioinspired Ether Cyclizations within a &#960;&#8208;Basic Capsule Compared to Autocatalysis on &#960;&#8208;Acidic Surfaces and Pnictogen&#8208;Bonding Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Breaking the rules: Thanks to their broad responsiveness, epoxide&#8208;opening ether cyclizations are identified as ideal for the direct comparison of supramolecular catalysts. The results suggest that &#960;&#8208;basic supramolecular capsule catalysts are as outstanding as pnictogen&#8208;bonding catalysts in breaking the Baldwin rules with high diastereoselectivity, particularly in cyclization cascades leading to bicyclic products. In clear contrast, chemo&#8208; and diastereoselective co&#8208; and autocatalysis is confirmed to be unique for anion&#8208;&#960; interactions.







Abstract
While the integration of supramolecular principles in catalysis attracts increasing attention, a direct comparative assessment of the resulting systems catalysts to work out distinct characteristics is often difficult. Herein is reported how the broad responsiveness of ether cyclizations to diverse inputs promises to fill this gap. Cyclizations in the confined, &#960;&#8208;basic and Br&#248;nsted acidic interior of supramolecular capsules, for instance, are found to excel with speed (exceeding general Br&#248;nsted acid and hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysts by far) and selective violations of the Baldwin rules (as extreme as the so far unique pnictogen&#8208;bonding catalysts). The complementary cyclization on &#960;&#8208;acidic aromatic surfaces remains unique with regard to autocatalysis, which is shown to be chemo&#8208; and diastereoselective with regard to product&#8208;like co&#8208;catalysts but, so far, not enantioselective.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Breaking the rules&lt;/b&gt;: Thanks to their broad responsiveness, epoxide-opening ether cyclizations are identified as ideal for the direct comparison of supramolecular catalysts. The results suggest that &#960;-basic supramolecular capsule catalysts are as outstanding as pnictogen-bonding catalysts in breaking the Baldwin rules with high diastereoselectivity, particularly in cyclization cascades leading to bicyclic products. In clear contrast, chemo- and diastereoselective co- and autocatalysis is confirmed to be unique for anion-&#960; interactions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the integration of supramolecular principles in catalysis attracts increasing attention, a direct comparative assessment of the resulting systems catalysts to work out distinct characteristics is often difficult. Herein is reported how the broad responsiveness of ether cyclizations to diverse inputs promises to fill this gap. Cyclizations in the confined, &#960;-basic and Br&#248;nsted acidic interior of supramolecular capsules, for instance, are found to excel with speed (exceeding general Br&#248;nsted acid and hydrogen-bonding catalysts by far) and selective violations of the Baldwin rules (as extreme as the so far unique pnictogen-bonding catalysts). The complementary cyclization on &#960;-acidic aromatic surfaces remains unique with regard to autocatalysis, which is shown to be chemo- and diastereoselective with regard to product-like co-catalysts but, so far, not enantioselective.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of 2&#8208;Arylindolines and 2,2&#8208;Disubstituted Indolines by Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric synthesis of 2&#8208;arylindolines was achieved by kinetic resolution with n&#8208;butyllithium and the chiral ligand sparteine followed by electrophilic quench. The recovered starting materials and the 2,2&#8208;disubstituted products were isolated with high enantiomer ratios. Variable temperature NMR spectroscopy and DFT studies were used to determine the rate of Boc rotation.







Abstract
Kinetic resolution of 2&#8208;arylindolines (2,3&#8208;dihydroindoles) was achieved by treatment of their N&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl (Boc) derivatives with n&#8208;butyllithium and sparteine in toluene at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C followed by electrophilic quench. The unreacted starting materials together with the 2,2&#8208;disubstituted products could be isolated with high enantiomer ratios. Variable temperature NMR spectroscopy showed that the rate of Boc rotation was fast (&#916;G&#8800;&#8776;57&#8197;kJ/mol at 195&#8197;K). This was corroborated by DFT studies and by in&#8197;situ ReactIR spectroscopy. The enantioenriched N&#8208;Boc&#8208;2&#8208;arylindolines were converted to 2,2&#8208;disubstituted products without significant loss in enantiopurity. Hence, either enantiomer of the 2,2&#8208;disubstituted products could be obtained with high selectivity from the same enantiomer of the chiral ligand sparteine (one from the kinetic resolution and the other from subsequent lithiation&#8208;trapping of the recovered starting material). Secondary amine products were prepared by removing the Boc group with acid to provide a way to access highly enantioenriched 2&#8208;aryl and 2,2&#8208;disubstituted indolines.

         <title>Bipyridinium and Phenanthrolinium Dications for Metal&#8208;Free Hydrodefluorination: Distinctive Carbon&#8208;Based Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of novel organic dications as carbon&#8208;based Lewis acids is reported. The Hydride Ion Affinity (HIA) of these bipyridinium and phenanthrolinium salts is exploited to initiate hydrodefluorination catalysis. Further, the participation of these species enables deuterodefluorination. Experimental and DFT analysis support the role of the dications in the initiation of silylium&#8208;mediated catalysis.







Abstract
The development of novel Lewis acids derived from bipyridinium and phenanthrolinium dications is reported. Calculations of Hydride Ion Affinity (HIA) values indicate high carbon&#8208;based Lewis acidity at the ortho and para positions. This arises in part from extensive LUMO delocalization across the aromatic backbones. Species [C10H6R2N2CH2CH2]2+ (R=H [1&#8201;a]2+, Me [1&#8201;f]2+, tBu [1&#8201;g]2+), and [C12H4R4N2CH2CH2]2+ (R=H [2&#8201;a]2+, Me [2&#8201;b]2+) were prepared and evaluated for use in the initiation of hydrodefluorination (HDF) catalysis. Compound [2&#8201;a]2+ proved highly effective towards generating catalytically active silylium cations via Lewis acid&#8208;mediated hydride abstraction from silane. This enabled the HDF of a range of aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208; substituted sp3(C&#8722;F) bonds under mild conditions. The protocol was also adapted to effect the deuterodefluorination of cis&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;(CF3)3C6H9. The dications are shown to act as hydride acceptors with the isolation of neutral species C16H14N2 (3&#8201;a) and C16H10Me4N2 (3&#8201;b) and monocationic species [C14H13N2]+ ([4&#8201;a]+) and [C18H21N2]+ ([4&#8201;b]+). Experimental and computational data provide further support that the dications are initiators in the generation of silylium cations.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of NIR emitters based on earth&#8208;abundant elements is an important goal in contemporary science. We present here Cr(0), Mo(0) and W(0) carbonyl complexes with a pyridyl&#8208;mesoionic carbene (MIC) based ligand. A detailed photophysical investigation shows that all the complexes exhibit dual emissions in the VIS and in the NIR region. The emissive excited states are assigned to two distinct triplet states by time&#8208;resolved emission and step&#8208;scan FTIR spectroscopy at variable temperature, supported by density functional theory. In particular, the NIR emissive triplet state exhibits unprecedented lifetimes of up to 600 &#177; 10 ns and quantum yields reaching 1.7 &#8729; 10&#8722;4 at room temperature. These are the first examples of Cr(0), Mo(0) and W(0) complexes that emit in the NIR II region.</dc:description>

         <title>Local Light&#8208;controlled Generation of Calcium Carbonate and Barium Carbonate Biomorphs via Photochemical Stimulation.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photochemical activation is proposed as a general method for controlling the crystallization of sparingly soluble carbonates in space and time. The photogeneration of carbonate in an alkaline environment is achieved upon photo&#8208;decarboxylation of an organic precursor using a conventional 365 nm UV LED. Local irradiation was conducted focusing the LED light on a 300 mm radius spot on a closed glass crystallization cell. The precursor solution was optimized to avoid the precipitation of the photoreaction organic byproducts and prevent photoinduced pH changes to achieve the formation of calcium carbonate only in the corresponding irradiated area. The crystallization was monitored in real&#8208;time by time&#8208;lapse imaging. The method is also shown to work in gels. Similarly, it was also shown to photo&#8208;activate locally the formation of barium carbonate biomorphs. In the last case, the morphology of these biomimetic structures was tuned by changing the irradiation intensity.</dc:description>

         <title>Bonding in Barium Boryloxides, Siloxides, Phenoxides and Silazides: A Comparison with the Lighter Alkaline Earths</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Barium and related alkaline&#8208;earth complexes bearing combinations of boryloxides, siloxides, phenoxides and amides have been structurally authenticated. Their structural patterns and bonding properties have been thoroughly investigated by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Barium complexes ligated by bulky boryloxides [OBR2]&#8722; (where R=CH(SiMe3)2, 2,4,6&#8208;iPr3&#8208;C6H2 or 2,4,6&#8208;(CF3)3&#8208;C6H2), siloxide [OSi(SiMe3)3]&#8722;, and/or phenoxide [O&#8208;2,6&#8208;Ph2&#8208;C6H3]&#8722;, have been prepared. A diversity of coordination patterns is observed in the solid state for both homoleptic and heteroleptic complexes, with coordination numbers ranging between 2 and 4. The identity of the bridging ligand in heteroleptic dimers [Ba(&#956;2&#8208;X1)(X2)]2 depends largely on the given pair of ligands X1 and X2. Experimentally, the propensity to fill the bridging position increases according to [OB{CH(SiMe3)2}2)]&#8722;&lt;[N(SiMe3)2]&#8722;&lt;[OSi(SiMe3)3]&#8722;&lt;[O(2,6&#8208;Ph2&#8208;C6H3)]&#8722;&lt;[OB(2,4,6&#8208;iPr3&#8208;C6H2)2]&#8722;. This trend is the overall expression of 3 properties: steric constraints, electronic density and &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;donating capability of the negatively charged atom, and ability to generate Ba&#8201;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8201;F, Ba&#8201;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8201;C(&#960;) or Ba&#8201;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8201;H&#8722;C secondary interactions. The comparison of the structural motifs in the complexes [Ae{&#956;2&#8208;N(SiMe3)2}(OB{CH(SiMe3)2}2)]2 (Ae = Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba) suggest that these observations may be extended to all alkaline earths. DFT calculations highlight the largely prevailing ionic character of ligand&#8208;Ae bonding in all compounds. The ionic character of the Ae&#8208;ligand bond encourages bridging coordination, whereas the number of bridging ligands is controlled by steric factors. DFT computations also indicate that in [Ba(&#956;2&#8208;X1)(X2)]2 heteroleptic dimers, ligand predilection for bridging vs. terminal positions is dictated by the ability to establish secondary interactions between the metals and the ligands.

         <title>Subphthalocyaninato Boron(III) Hydride: Synthesis, Structure and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time subphthalocyanine&#8208;hydride derivatives that exhibit high reactivity as hydroboration reagents of aldehydes have been prepared. This transformation has proven to be a useful alternative method for the axial functionalisation of dodecafluoro&#8208;subphthalocyanines using electrophiles. Considering the increasing interest in SubPcs as electron&#8208;acceptor semiconductors to replace fullerene in organic photovoltaic devices, it is of the utmost importance to develop new synthetic methodologies for their axial functionalisation.







Abstract
Subphthalocyanine (SubPc) chemistry has been limited so far by their high sensitivity toward strong nucleophiles. In particular, the substitution of the axial chlorine atom by a nucleophilic group in the case of less&#8208;reactive SubPcs, such as those bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing peripheral substituents, presents some limitations and requires harsh conditions. By taking advantage of the electrophilic character of DIBAL&#8208;H, it has been possible to prepare for the first time SubPc&#8208;hydride derivatives that exhibit high reactivity as hydroboration reagents of aldehydes. This hydride transfer requires using a typical carbonyl activator (trimethylsilyl triflate) and only one equivalent of aldehyde, affording SubPcs with an axial benzyloxy group in good yield. This transformation has proven to be a useful alternative method for the axial functionalisation of dodecafluoroSubPc, a paradigmatic SubPc derivative, by using electrophiles for the first time. Considering the increasing interest in SubPcs as electron&#8208;acceptor semiconductors with remarkable absorption in the visible range to replace fullerene in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, it is of the utmost importance to develop new synthetic methodologies for their axial functionalisation.

         <title>Chiral Perylene Bisimide Dyes by Interlocked Arene Substituents in the Bay Area</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interlocked &#960;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;stacking motif of bay&#8208;tetraarylated perylene bisimides endows these molecules with chirality and rich conformational isomerism. These structural features are elucidated by X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR. Optical spectroscopy including CD and CPL provide insights into their functional properties.







Abstract
A series of perylene bisimide (PBI) dyes bearing various aryl substituents in 1,6,7,12 bay positions has been synthesized by Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reaction. These molecules exhibit an exceptionally large and conformationally fixed twist angle of the PBI &#960;&#8208;core due to the high steric congestion imparted by the aryl substituents in bay positions. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analyses of phenyl&#8208;, naphthyl&#8208; and pyrenyl&#8208;functionalized PBIs reveal interlocked &#960;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;stacking motifs, leading to conformational chirality and the possibility for the isolation of enantiopure atropoisomers by semipreparative HPLC. The interlocked arrangement endows these molecules with substantial racemization barriers of about 120&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for the tetraphenyl&#8208; and tetra&#8208;2&#8208;naphthyl&#8208;substituted derivatives, which is among the highest racemization barriers for axially chiral PBIs. Variable temperature NMR studies reveal the presence of a multitude of up to fourteen conformational isomers in solution that are interconverted via smaller activation barriers of about 65&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The redox and optical properties of these core&#8208;twisted PBIs have been characterized by cyclic voltammetry, UV/Vis/NIR and fluorescence spectroscopy and their respective atropo&#8208;enantiomers were further characterized by circular dichroism (CD) and circular polarized luminescence (CPL) spectroscopy.

         <title>The Binding Pocket at the Interface of Multimeric Telomere G&#8208;quadruplexes: Myth or Reality?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binding of naphthalenediimide (NDI) dyads at the interface of contiguous telomeric G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4) in hTel45 is revealed by synergically combining time&#8208;resolved fluorescence, induced circular dichroism and isothermal titration calorimetry and further rationalized with modeling data.

Human telomeric DNA with hundreds of repeats of the 5&#8217;&#8208;TTAGGG&#8208;3&#8217; motif plays a crucial role in several biological processes. It folds into G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures and features a pocket at the interface of two contiguous G4 blocks. Up to now no structural NMR and crystallographic data are available for ligands interacting with contiguous G4s. Naphthalene diimide monomers and dyads were investigated as ligands of a dimeric G4 of human telomeric DNA comparing the results with those of the model monomeric G4. Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence, circular dichroism, isothermal titration calorimetry and molecular modeling were used to elucidate binding features. Ligand fluorescence lifetime and induced circular dichroism unveiled occupancy of the binding site at the interface. Thermodynamic parameters confirmed the hypothesis as they remarkably change for the dyad complexes of the monomeric and dimeric telomeric G4. The bi&#8208;functional ligand structure of the dyads is a fundamental requisite for binding at the G4 interface as only the dyads engage in complexes with 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry, lodging in the pocket at the interface and establishing multiple interactions with the DNA skeleton. In the absence of NMR and crystallographic data, our study affords important proofs of binding at the interface pocket and clues on the role played by the ligand structure.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Binding of naphthalenediimide (NDI) dyads&lt;/b&gt; at the interface of contiguous telomeric G-quadruplexes (G4) in hTel45 is revealed by synergically combining time-resolved fluorescence, induced circular dichroism and isothermal titration calorimetry and further rationalized with modeling data.

         <title>Non&#8208;conventional Behavior of a 2,1&#8208;Benzazaphosphole: Heterodiene or Hidden Phosphinidene?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dualistic behavior of the titled 2,1&#8208;benzazaphosphole, behaving as a heterodiene versus a hidden phosphinidene, has been theoretically predicted based on an NTR analysis. This spectacular feature has been proven chemically as well. Thus, it is able to participate in hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions forming expected heterocycles, but it also serves as a 4e ligand, using two phosphorus electron lone pairs, bridging two transition metals (Au, Ag and Co).







Abstract
The titled 2,1&#8208;benzazaphosphole (1) (i.&#8201;e. ArP, where Ar=2&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H4, Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) showed a spectacular reactivity behaving both as a reactive heterodiene in hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reactions or as a hidden phosphinidene in the coordination toward selected transition metals (TMs). Thus, 1 reacts with electron&#8208;deficient alkynes RC&#8801;CR (R=CO2Me, C5F4N) giving 1&#8208;phospha&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;iminonaphthalenes 2 and 3, that undergo hydrogen migration producing 1&#8208;phosphanaphthalenes 4 and 5. Compound 1 is also able to activate the C=C double bond in selected N&#8208;alkyl/aryl&#8208;maleimides RN(C(O)CH)2 (R=Me, tBu, Ph) resulting in the addition products 7&#8211;9 with bridged bicyclic [2.2.1] structures. The binding of the maleimides to 1 is semi&#8208;reversible upon heating. By contrast, when 1 was treated with selected TM complexes, it serves as a 4e donor bridging two TMs thus producing complexes [&#956;&#8208;ArP(AuCl)2] (10), [(&#956;&#8208;ArP)4Ag4][X]4 (X=BF4 (11), OTf (12)) and [&#956;&#8208;ArP(Co2(CO)6)] (13). The structure and electron distribution of the starting material 1 as well as of other compounds were also studied from the theoretical point of view.

         <title>Evolution of a Strategy for the Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Cornexistin</title>

Cycle tricks: The evolution of the first total synthesis of (+)&#8208;cornexistin is reported. Highlights of the successful chiral&#8208;pool strategy are an intermolecular Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi coupling to install the Z alkene, a syn&#8208;Evans&#8208;aldol reaction to construct the C2/C3 stereocenters, an intramolecular allylic alkylation to close the nine&#8208;membered carbocycle and the stepwise hydrolysis of a &#946;&#8208;keto nitrile, which furnished the maleic anhydride.







Abstract
Herein is given a full account of the evolution of the first total synthesis of (+)&#8208;cornexistin. Initial efforts were based on masking the reactive maleic anhydride moiety as a 3,4&#8208;substituted furan and on forming the nine&#8208;membered carbocycle in an intramolecular Conia&#8208;ene or Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) reaction. Those strategies suffered from low yields and were jeopardized by a late&#8208;stage installation of the Z&#8208;alkene, as well as the stereocenters along the eastern periphery. These issues were addressed by employing a chiral&#8208;pool strategy that involved construction of the crucial stereocenters at C2, C3 and C8 at an early stage with installation of the maleic anhydride as late as possible. The successful approach featured an intermolecular NHK coupling to install the Z&#8208;alkene, a syn&#8208;Evans&#8208;aldol reaction to forge the stereocenters along the eastern periphery, an intramolecular allylic alkylation to close the nine&#8208;membered carbocycle, and a challenging stepwise hydrolysis of a &#946;&#8208;keto nitrile to furnish the maleic anhydride.

         <title>Acylhydrazone Subunits as a Proton Cargo Delivery System in 7&#8208;Hydroxyquinoline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dropping your H&#8242;s: Two structurally different acylhydrazones containing imine (1&#8201;a) and ketimine (2&#8201;a) functions have been evaluated as proton cargo delivery subunits in the 7&#8208;hydroxyquinoline platform. The tautomeric OH proton was delivered to the quinoline nitrogen by covalent (1&#8201;a) and hydrogen (2&#8201;a) bonding. The system is characterized by long stability in the switched state, thus enabling control of the bidirectional proton motion under different light energy.







Abstract
The reimagined concept of long&#8208;range tautomeric proton transfer using crane subunits is shown by designing and synthesising two new acylhydrazones containing a 7&#8208;hydroxyquinoline (7&#8208;OHQ) platform. The acylhydrazone subunits attached to the 7&#8208;OHQ at the 8th position act as crane arms for delivering proton cargo to the quinoline nitrogen. Light&#8208;induced tautomerization to their keto forms leads to Z/E isomerization of the C=C axle bond, followed by proton delivery to the quinoline nitrogen by the formation of covalent or hydrogen bonds. The axle&#8216;s being either an imine or ketimine bond is the structural difference between the studied compounds. The &#8722;CH3 group in the latter provides steric strain, resulting in different proton transport pathways. Both compounds show long thermal stability in the switched state, which creates a tuneable action of bidirectional proton cargo transport by using different wavelengths of irradiation. Upon the addition of acid, the quinoline nitrogen is protonated; this results in E/Z configuration switching of the acylhydrazone subunits. This was proven by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis and NMR spectroscopy.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dropping your H&#8242;s&lt;/b&gt;: Two structurally different acylhydrazones containing imine (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;
&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;) and ketimine (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;
&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;) functions have been evaluated as proton cargo delivery subunits in the 7-hydroxyquinoline platform. The tautomeric OH proton was delivered to the quinoline nitrogen by covalent (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;
&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;) and hydrogen (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;
&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;) bonding. The system is characterized by long stability in the switched state, thus enabling control of the bidirectional proton motion under different light energy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reimagined concept of long-range tautomeric proton transfer using crane subunits is shown by designing and synthesising two new acylhydrazones containing a 7-hydroxyquinoline (7-OHQ) platform. The acylhydrazone subunits attached to the 7-OHQ at the 8th position act as crane arms for delivering proton cargo to the quinoline nitrogen. Light-induced tautomerization to their keto forms leads to &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; isomerization of the C=C axle bond, followed by proton delivery to the quinoline nitrogen by the formation of covalent or hydrogen bonds. The axle&#8216;s being either an imine or ketimine bond is the structural difference between the studied compounds. The &#8722;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group in the latter provides steric strain, resulting in different proton transport pathways. Both compounds show long thermal stability in the switched state, which creates a tuneable action of bidirectional proton cargo transport by using different wavelengths of irradiation. Upon the addition of acid, the quinoline nitrogen is protonated; this results in &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; configuration switching of the acylhydrazone subunits. This was proven by single-crystal X-ray structure analysis and NMR spectroscopy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The Deuterated &#8220;Magic Methyl&#8221; Group: A Guide to Site&#8208;Selective Trideuteromethyl Incorporation and Labeling by Using CD3 Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;3 D&#8221; drug development: The deuterated &#8220;magic methyl&#8221; group is attracting increased interest in pharmaceutical industry. In this review, we discuss the currently available methods for C&#8722;CD3 bond forming reactions and classify them according to the trideuteromethylation reagent. The mechanisms, scope and limitations of each method are considered in order to provide a guide for targeted trideutermethylation.







Abstract
In the field of medicinal chemistry, the precise installation of a trideuteromethyl group is gaining ever&#8208;increasing attention. Site&#8208;selective incorporation of the deuterated &#8220;magic methyl&#8221; group can provide profound pharmacological benefits and can be considered an important tool for drug optimization and development. This review provides a structured overview, according to trideuteromethylation reagent, of currently established methods for site&#8208;selective trideuteromethylation of carbon atoms. In addition to CD3, the selective introduction of CD2H and CDH2 groups is also considered. For all methods, the corresponding mechanism and scope are discussed whenever reported. As such, this review can be a starting point for synthetic chemists to further advance trideuteromethylation methodologies. At the same time, this review aims to be a guide for medicinal chemists, offering them the available C&#8722;CD3 formation strategies for the preparation of new or modified drugs.

         <title>ChemBead Enabled High&#8208;Throughput Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling Reveals a New, Complementary Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) methods are central to modern medicinal chemistry. While many HTE approaches to C&#8208;N and Csp  2  &#8208;Csp  2  &#160;bonds are available, options for Csp  2  &#8208;Csp  3  &#160;bonds are limited. We report here how the adaptation of nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of aryl bromides with alkyl halides to HTE is enabled by AbbVie ChemBeads technology. Using this approach, we were able to quickly map out the reactivity space at a global level using a challenging array of 3 &#215; 222 micromolar reactions. The observed hit rate (56%) is competitive with other often&#8208;used HTE reactions and the results are scalable. A key to this level of success was the finding that bipyridine 6&#8208;carboxamidine (BpyCam), a ligand that had not previously been shown to be optimal in any reaction, is as general as the best&#8208;known ligands with complementary reactivity. Such &#8220;cryptic&#8221; catalysts may be common and modern HTE methods should facilitate the process of finding these catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescent Molecular Logic Gates Driven by Temperature and by Protons in Solution and on Solid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Temperature&#8208;driven fluorescent NOT logic is demonstrated by exploiting predissociation in a 1,3,5&#8208;trisubstituted &#916;  2  &#8208;pyrazoline on its own and when grafted onto silica microparticles. Related &#916;  2  &#8208;pyrazolines become proton&#8208;driven YES and NOT logic gates on the basis of fluorescent PET (photoinduced electron transfer) switches. Additional PASS 1 and YES + PASS 1 logic gates on silica are also demonstrated within the same family. Beside these small&#8208;molecule systems, a polymeric molecular thermometer based on a benzofurazan&#8208;derivatized N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide copolymer is attached to silica to produce temperature&#8208;driven fluorescent YES logic.</dc:description>

         <title>Variations in Complementary Hydrogen Bonds Direct Assembly Patterns of Isosteric Polyheteroaromatics at Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intermolecular interactions guide self&#8208;assembly on the surface. Precise control over these interactions by rational design of the molecule should allow fine control over the self&#8208;assembly patterns. Functional groups installed for electronic modulation often induce significant changes in the molecular dimensions, thereby disrupting the original assembly pattern. To overcome this challenge, we have employed a family of isosteric phenazine derivatives,  DHP  ,  DAP  , and  DBQD  , to investigate the impacts of hydrogen bonding on two&#8208;dimensional molecular self&#8208;assembly. While these molecules are similar in size and chemical composition, the strength and directionality of hydrogen bonding differ significantly depending on the chemical structure of donor&#8211;acceptor pairs and prototropic tautomerization from positional isomerism. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) characterization of the assembled structures on Ag(111), Au(111), and Cu(100) surfaces revealed that minimal changes in molecular structure have a profound impact on the self&#8208;assembly patterns. While  DHP  exhibits highly ordered and robust assemblies,  DAP  and  DBQD  show either spatially confined or ill&#8208;defined assemblies. In conjunction with hydrogen bonding, prototropic tautomerism is a potent strategy to modulate molecular 2D lattices on surfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly sensitive fluorescent pH microsensors based on HPTS molecules immobilized on silica microparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>HPTS is a remarkably interesting pH sensitive dye that has been used for plenty of applications. Its high quantum yield and extremely sensitive ratiometric fluorescence against pH change makes it a very favorable for pH sensing applications and development of pH nano/microsensors. However, its strong negative charge and lack of easily modifiable functional groups makes it difficult to be used with charged substrates such as silica. This study reports a noncovalent HPTS immobilization methodology on silica microparticles that considers the retention of pH sensitivity as well as long term stability of the pH microsensors. The study emphasizes on importance of surface charge for governing the sensitivity of the immobilized HPTS dye molecules on silica microparticles. Importance of methodology of immobilization that preserves the sensitivity as well as stability of the microsensors is also assessed.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Level Chirality Transferring from Amino Acid Derivatives to CPL&#8208;Active Nanoparticles in Aqueous Medium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality at different levels is widely observed in nature, but the clue to connect them together, and the way how the chirality transfers among different levels are still obscure. Herein, we constructed a L&#8208;/D&#8208;lysine&#8208;based self&#8208;assembly system, in which two&#8208;step chirality transferring among three different levels was observed in aqueous solution.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chirality at different levels is widely observed in nature, but the clue to connect them together, and the way how the chirality transfers among different levels are still obscure. Herein, we constructed a L-/D-lysine-based self-assembly system, in which two-step chirality transferring among three different levels was observed in aqueous solution. The chirality was originated from the point chirality of amino acid derivatives L-/D-PyLys hydrochlorides, and transferred to the planar conformational chirality of water-soluble pillar[5]arene pR-/pS-WP5. Then, with the aid of pR-/pS-WP5, nanoparticles were formed that exhibited L-/R-handed circularly polarized luminescence with a dissymmetry factor up to &#177;0.001, arising from pyrene excimers arranged in the chiral manner. This multi-level chirality transferring not only provides a perspective to trace potential clue, and to pursue certain way by which the chirality transfers, but also offers a strategy to arise the controllable CPL emission in aqueous medium.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cell&#8208;Penetrating Mitochondrion&#8208;Targeting Ligands for the Universal Delivery of Small Molecules, Proteins and Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paving the way for future targeted therapy with a variety of biological agents. Cell&#8208;penetrating mitochondrion&#8208;targeting ligands are capable of universal mitochondrial delivery of small molecules, proteins and nanomaterials. Upon successful cellular delivery and rapid endosome escape, the released native cargos were found to be predominantly localized inside mitochondria. The successful delivery of doxorubicin (a well&#8208;known anticancer drug) showed that the released drug possessed potent cell cytotoxicity, disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential and finally led to apoptosis.







Abstract
Mitochondria are key organelles that perform vital cellular functions such as those related to cell survival and death. The targeted delivery of different types of cargos to mitochondria is a well&#8208;established strategy to study mitochondrial biology and diseases. Of the various existing mitochondrion&#8208;transporting vehicles, most suffer from poor cytosolic entry, low delivery efficiency, limited cargo types, and cumbersome preparation protocols, and none was known to be universally applicable for mitochondrial delivery of different types of cargos (small molecules, proteins, and nanomaterials). Herein, two new cell&#8208;penetrating, mitochondrion&#8208;targeting ligands (named MitoLigand) that are capable of effectively &#8220;tagging&#8221; small&#8208;molecule drugs, native proteins and nanomaterials are disclosed, as well as their corresponding chemoselective conjugation chemistry. Upon successful cellular delivery and rapid endosome escape, the released native cargos were found to be predominantly localized inside mitochondria. Finally, by successfully delivering doxorubicin, a well&#8208;known anticancer drug, to the mitochondria of HeLa cells, we showed that the released drug possessed potent cell cytotoxicity, disrupted the mitochondrial membrane potential and finally led to apoptosis. Our strategy thus paves the way for future mitochondrion&#8208;targeted therapy with a variety of biologically active agents.

         <title>Molecular Gears: From Solution to Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Moving up a gear: Molecular gears have been explored since the early 1980s, but only in solution, which is intrinsically limited to intramolecular gearing motions. To propagate mechanical power from one molecule to the next, it is necessary to immobilize cogwheels in a dedicated spatial arrangement, such as in a train of gears on a surface. In the last years, some impressive progress has been made, leading to the correlated rotation of up to three molecules.







Abstract
This review highlights the major efforts devoted to the development of molecular gears over the past 40&#8197;years, from pioneering covalent bis&#8208;triptycyl systems undergoing intramolecular correlated rotation in solution, to the most recent examples of gearing systems anchored on a surface, which allow intermolecular transmission of mechanical power. Emphasis is laid on the different strategies devised progressively to control the architectures of molecular bevel and spur gears, as intramolecular systems in solution or intermolecular systems on surfaces, while aiming at increased efficiency, complexity and functionality.

         <title>Contributions of Internal Atoms of Atomically Precise Metal Nanoclusters to Catalytic Performances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Analyzing the sum of the parts: It is challenging to determine explicitly which atom(s) contribute most to overall catalytic performance because the observed performance reflects an ensemble average from all the atoms in the catalyst. This review provides a new perspective on understanding the crucial roles of internal atoms of atomically precise metal nanocluster catalysts in tuning the catalytic properties.







Abstract
Every atom of a heterogeneous catalyst can play a direct or indirect role in its overall catalytic properties.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Analyzing the sum of the parts&lt;/b&gt;: It is challenging to determine explicitly which atom(s) contribute most to overall catalytic performance because the observed performance reflects an ensemble average from all the atoms in the catalyst. This review provides a new perspective on understanding the crucial roles of internal atoms of atomically precise metal nanocluster catalysts in tuning the catalytic properties.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every atom of a heterogeneous catalyst can play a direct or indirect role in its overall catalytic properties. However, it is extremely challenging to determine explicitly which atom(s) of a catalyst can contribute most to its catalytic performance because the observed performance usually reflects an average of all the atoms in the catalyst. The emergence of atomically precise metal nanoclusters brings unprecedented opportunities to address these central issues, as the crystal structures of such nanoclusters have been solved, and hence very fundamental understanding of nanocatalysis can be attained at an atomic level. This minireview focuses on recent efforts to reveal the contributions of the internal atoms or vacancies of nanocluster catalysts to the catalytic processes, including how the catalytic activity can be dramatically changed by the central doping of a foreign atom, how catalytic activation and inactivation can be reversibly switched by shuttling the central atom into and out of nanoclusters, and how evolution in catalytic activity can be driven by structural periodicity in the inner kernels of the nanoclusters.

         <title>Porous Anionic Co(II) Metal&#8208;Organic Framework, with a High Density of Amino Groups, as a Superior Luminescent Sensor for Turn&#8208;on Al(III) Detection</title>

Al3+ sensor: A 3D porous anionic MOF displays superior turn&#8208;on sensing for Al(III) ions with ultralow sensitivity resulted from stronger interactions with free amines by employing strategic design principle. The detection approach is simple, fast, portable and economic as demonstrated by MOF filter paper tests for naked eye observation.







Abstract
Accumulation of high concentrations of Al(III) in body has a direct impact on health and therefore, the trace detection of Al(III) has been a matter for substantial concern. An anionic metal organic framework ({[Me2NH2]0.5[Co(DATRz)0.5(NH2BDC)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xG}n; 1; HDATRz=3,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole, H2NH2&#8208;BDC=2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylic acid, G=guest molecule) composed of two types of secondary building units (SBU) and channels of varying sizes was synthesized by employing a rational design mixed ligand synthesis approach. Free &#8722;NH2 groups on both the ligands are immobilized onto the pore surface of the MOF which acts as a superior luminescent sensor for turn&#8208;on Al(III) detection. Furthermore, the large channels could allow the counter&#8208;ions to pass through and get exchanged to selectively detect Al(III) in presence of other seventeen metal ions with magnificent luminescence enhancement. The observed limit of detection is as low as 17.5&#8197;ppb, which is the lowest among the MOF&#8208;based sensors achieved so far. To make this detection approach simple, portable and economic, we demonstrate MOF filter paper test for real time naked eye observation.

         <title>Dihydroazulene&#8208;Azobenzene&#8208;Dihydroazulene Triad Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The importance of connections: The photoactivity of dihydroazulene&#8208;azobenzene&#8208;dihydroazulene (DHA&#8208;AZB&#8208;DHA) triad photoswitches depends strongly on the para/meta connectivity at the central azobenzene unit. The synthesis and switching properties of two triad systems are presented here. The meta connectivity allowed reversible photo&#8208;/thermoswitching between DHA&#8208;trans&#8208;AZB&#8208;DHA and VHF&#8208;cis&#8208;AZB&#8208;VHF where VHF is the vinylheptafulvene photoisomer of DHA. Ultrafast spectroscopy revealed the DHA&#8208;to&#8208;VHF photoisomerization to be faster than the trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis AZB photoisomerization.







Abstract
Photoswitch triads comprising two dihydroazulene (DHA) units in conjugation with a central trans&#8208;azobenzene (AZB) unit were prepared in stepwise protocols starting from meta&#8208; and para&#8208;disubstituted azobenzenes. The para&#8208;connected triad had significantly altered optical properties and lacked the photoactivity of the separate photochromes. In contrast, for the meta&#8208;connected triad, all three photochromes could be photoisomerized to generate an isomer with two vinylheptafulvene (VHF) units and a cis&#8208;azobenzene unit. Ultrafast spectroscopy of the photoisomerizations revealed a fast DHA&#8208;to&#8208;VHF photoisomerization and a slower trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis AZB photoisomerization. This meta triad underwent thermal VHF&#8208;to&#8208;DHA back&#8208;conversion with a similar rate of all VHFs, independent of the identity of the neighboring units, and in parallel thermal cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans AZB conversion. The experimental observations were supported by computation (excitation spectra and orbital analysis of the transitions).

         <title>Structure Elucidation and Spectroscopic Analysis of Chromophores Produced by Oxidative Psilocin Dimerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;made color frenzy: Psilocin oxidation causes the iconic blueing of Psilocybe &#8220;magic&#8221; mushrooms. To prevent oligomerization, but allow for dimerization, 5&#8208; and 7&#8208;methylated psilocin monomers were synthesized. Chemical oxidation enabled spectroscopic chromophore investigation of the dimeric gateway compounds and comparison to computationally derived absorption spectra. The 7,7&#8217;&#8208;coupled quinoid psilocyl dimer was identified as major initial blue product, while the 5,5&#8217;&#8208;coupled dimer contributes a greenish tint.







Abstract
Psilocin (1) is the dephosphorylated and psychotropic metabolite of the mushroom natural product psilocybin. Oxidation of the phenolic hydroxy group at the C&#8208;4 position of 1 results in formation of oligomeric indoloquinoid chromophores responsible for the iconic blueing of bruised psilocybin&#8208;producing mushrooms. Based on previous NMR experiments, the hypothesis included that the 5,5&#8217;&#8208;coupled quinone dimer of 1 was the primary product responsible for the blue color. To test this hypothesis, ring&#8208;methylated 1 derivatives were synthesized to provide stable analogs of 1 dimers that could be completely characterized. The chemically oxidized derivatives were spectroscopically analyzed and compared to computationally derived absorbance spectra. Experimental evidence did not support the original hypothesis. Rather, the blue color was shown to stem from the quinoid 7,7&#8217;&#8208;coupled dimer of 1.

The tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanol, Si(C2F5)3OH, flashes out of the shadows of silanol derivatives in the cover image, paving the way to its disiloxane and disilanolate. Oxidation of tris(pentafluoroethyl)silane, Si(C2F5)3H, with NO2 provides Si(C2F5)3OH, which readily condenses to disiloxane (C2F5)3SiOSi(C2F5)3. Deprotonation of in situ generated Si(C2F5)3OH yields disilanolate [{Si(C2F5)3O}2]2&#8722; underlining the formally Lewis amphoteric character of the monomeric tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanolate, [Si(C2F5)3O]&#8722;.

         <title>Quadruple Role of Pd Catalyst in Domino Reaction Involving Aryl to Alkyl 1,5&#8208;Pd Migration to Access 1,9&#8208;Bridged Triptycenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed domino reaction of 1,8,13&#8208;tribromo&#8208;9&#8208;methoxytriptycenes is reported. Under conventional Suzuki coupling conditions, the triptycenes underwent multiple transformations to give 1,9&#8208;bridged triptycenes. Based on mechanistic investigations, a single Pd catalyst functions as Pd0, PdII and PdIV species to catalyze (1) 1,5&#8208;Pd migration, (2) intramolecular arylation, (3) homocoupling of phenylboronic acid and (4) Suzuki coupling.







Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed domino reaction of 1,8,13&#8208;tribromo&#8208;9&#8208;methoxytriptycenes is reported. Under conventional Suzuki coupling conditions, the triptycenes underwent multiple transformations to give 1,9&#8208;bridged triptycenes. Based on mechanistic investigations, a single Pd catalyst functions as Pd0, PdII and PdIV species to catalyze four distinct processes: (1) aryl to alkyl 1,5&#8208;Pd migration, (2) intramolecular arylation, (3) homocoupling of phenylboronic acid and (4) Suzuki coupling. DFT calculations revealed that 1,5&#8208;Pd migration likely proceeds via both concerted PdII and stepwise PdIV routes. Asymmetric synthesis of the chiral triptycenes, as well as optical resolution, and further transformation are also reported.

&#8220;The ultimate inspiration for this project came from work of the group of Robert West (Madison) from 2003 describing a stable silole&#8208;based biradical. It was tempting for us to explore the possibilities to prepare such neutral radicals and to add magnetic properties to siloles and germoles, thus creating a truly multifunctional material.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff.

         <title>Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Electronic Structure and Electrochemical Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ever increasing energy demand warrant smarter and minimized electronic devices which insist advanced materials. This review is to delineate the journey of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) from their dawn to commercialization for smarter world, blended with structure&#8208;property relationships and theoretical investigation.







Abstract
Smarter and minimization of devices are consistently substantial to shape the energy landscape. Significant amounts of endeavours have come forward as promising steps to surmount this formidable challenge. It is undeniable that material scientists were contemplating smarter material beyond purely inorganic or organic materials. To our delight, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), an inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid scaffold with unprecedented tunability and smart functionalities, have recently started their journey as an alternative. In this review, we focus on such propitious potential of MOFs that was untapped over a long time. We cover the synthetic strategies and (or) post&#8208;synthetic modifications towards the formation of conductive MOFs and their underlying concepts of charge transfer with structural aspects. We addressed theoretical calculations with the experimental outcomes and spectroelectrochemistry, which will trigger vigorous impetus about intrinsic electronic behaviour of the conductive frameworks. Finally, we discussed electrocatalysts and energy storage devices stemming from conductive MOFs to meet energy demand in the near future.

         <title>Controlling Antibacterial Activity Exclusively with Visible Light: Introducing a Tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;Chloro&#8208;Azobenzene Amino Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of a novel tetra&#8208; ortho &#8208;chloroazobenzene amino acid (CEBA) has enabled photoswitching of the antimicrobial activity of tyrocidine A analogues using exclusively visible light, granting spatiotemporal control under benign conditions. Compounds bearing this photoswitchable amino acid become active upon irradiation with red light, but quickly turn&#8208;off upon exposure to other visible light wavelengths. Critically, sunlight quickly triggers isomerisation of the red light&#8208;activated compounds into their original trans form, offering an ideal platform for self&#8208;deactivation upon release into the environment. Linear analogues of tyrocidine A were found to provide the best photocontrol of their antimicrobial activity, leading to compounds active against Acinetobacter baumannii upon isomerisation. Exploration of their N &#8208; and C &#8208;termini has provided insights into key elements of their structure and has allowed obtaining new antimicrobials displaying excellent strain selectivity and photocontrol.</dc:description>

         <title>Magnetic NiFe2O4 Nanoparticles Prepared via Non&#8208;aqueous Microwave&#8208;assisted Synthesis for Application in Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phase&#8208;pure spinel&#8208;type magnetic nickel ferrite (NiFe  2  O  4  ) nanocrystals in the size range of 4 to 11 nm were successfully synthesized by a fast and energy saving microwave&#8208;assisted approach. Size and accessible surface areas can be tuned precisely by the reaction parameters. Our results highlight the correlation between size, inversion degree, and magnetic characteristics of NiFe  2  O  4  nanoparticles, which enables fine&#8208;tuning of these parameters for a particular application without changing the elemental composition.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Phase-pure spinel-type magnetic nickel ferrite (NiFe  2  O  4  ) nanocrystals in the size range of 4 to 11 nm were successfully synthesized by a fast and energy saving microwave-assisted approach. Size and accessible surface areas can be tuned precisely by the reaction parameters. Our results highlight the correlation between size, inversion degree, and magnetic characteristics of NiFe  2  O  4  nanoparticles, which enables fine-tuning of these parameters for a particular application without changing the elemental composition. Moreover, the application potential of the synthesized powders for the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media was demonstrated, showing that a low degree of inversion is beneficial for the overall performance. The most active sample reaches an overpotential of 380 mV for water oxidation at 10 mA cm  -2  and 38.8 mA cm  -2  at 1.7 V vs RHE, combined with a low Tafel slope of 63 mV dec  -1  .&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Promoted NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Brightness&#8220;Ring&#8208;fusion&#8221; for Detection of Intestinal Inflammation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorophores with emission in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) have displayed salient advantages for biomedical applications. However, to achieve red&#8208;shifted wavelengths, the common strategy by reducing the energy bandgap of fluorophores always leads to compromised fluorescent brightness. Herein, we propose a molecular design concept by &#8220;ring&#8208;fusion&#8221; to modify the acceptor of AIEgen, which can extend the luminous wavelength from NIR&#8208;I to NIR&#8208;II. The yielded fluorophore (TTQP) with fused acceptor has shown enhanced absorption coefficient with a higher brightness in the nanoparticle formation, as compared to its NIR&#8208;I emissive counterpart (TTQ&#8208;DP) with the non&#8208;fused acceptor. Theoretical calculation further confirms that the ring&#8208;fusion action can efficiently promote the rigidity and planarity of the electron&#8208;deficient core, leading to a lower reorganization energy and nonradiative decay. The yielded TTQP NPs thus allow sensitive NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging of vasculature and intestinal inflammation in mice models. Therefore, we anticipate that our work will provide a promising molecular engineering strategy to enrich the library and broaden the application scope of NIR&#8208;II fluorophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Design, Synthesis, Evaluation and Structure of Allenic 1a,25&#8208; Dihydroxyvitamin D3&#160;Analogs with Locked Mobility at C&#8208;17</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vitamin D receptor ligands have potential for the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases and disorders related to the immune system. However hypercalcemic effects limit their therapeutical uses and call for the development of tissue&#8208;selective new analogs. We have designed and synthesized the first examples of 1&#945;,25&#8208; dihydroxyvitamin D 3&#160; analogs bearing an allenic unit attached to the D ring to restrict the side&#8208;chain conformational mobility. The triene system was constructed by a Pd 0 &#8208;mediated cyclization/Suzuki&#8208; Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling process in the presence of an allenic side chain. The allenic moiety was built through an orthoester&#8208;Claisen rearrangement of a propargylic alcohol. The biological activity and structure of (22 S )&#8208;1 a ,25&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;17,20&#8208;dien&#8208;24&#8208;homo&#8208;21&#8208;nor&#8208; vitamin D 3&#160; bound to binding domain of the vitamin D receptor, provide information concerning side&#8208;chain conformational requirements for biological activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Selectively Deoxyfluorinated N&#8208;Acetyllactosamine Analogues as 19F NMR Probes to Study Carbohydrate&#8208;Galectin Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Galectins are widely expressed galactose&#8208;binding lectins implied, for example, in immune regulation, metastatic spreading, and pathogen recognition.  N&#8208;Acetyllactosamine (Gal&#946;1&#8208;4GlcNAc, LacNAc) and its oligomeric or glycosylated forms are natural ligands of galectins. To probe substrate specificity and binding mode of galectins, we synthesized a complete series of six mono&#8208;deoxyfluorinated analogues of LacNAc, in which each hydroxyl has been selectively replaced by fluorine while the anomeric position has been protected as methyl &#946;&#8208;glycoside. Initial evaluation of their binding to human galectin&#8208;1 and &#8208;3 by ELISA and  19F NMR  T2  &#8208;filter revealed that deoxyfluorination at C3, C4&#8242; and C6&#8242; completely abolished binding to galectin&#8208;1 but very weak binding to galectin&#8208;3 was still detectable. Moreover, deoxyfluorination of C2&#8242; caused an approximately 8&#8208;fold increase in the&#160;binding affinity towards galectin&#8208;1, whereas binding to galectin&#8208;3 was essentially not affected. Lipophilicity measurement revealed that deoxyfluorination at the Gal moiety affects log  P  very differently compared to deoxyfluorination at the GlcNAc moiety.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zeolitic vanadotungstates with tunable microporosity have potential interests in gas separation. The pore openings of the materials are in between the diameters of normal butane and isobutane, which causes the materials only adsorb normal butane. The breakthrough experiments show that the materials effectively separate normal butane from the normal butane and isobutane mixture even at high temperatures. The robust materials can be reused without loss of the separation performance.</dc:description>

         <title>NHC Effects on Reduction Dynamics in Iron&#8208;catalyzed Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high abundance, low toxicity and rich redox chemistry of iron has resulted in a surge of iron catalyzed organic transformations over the last two decades. Within this area, N &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands have been widely utilized to achieve high yields across reactions including cross&#8208;coupling and C&#8208;H alkylation, amongst others. Central to the development of iron&#8208;NHC catalytic methods is the understanding of iron speciation and the propensity of these species to undergo reduction events, as low&#8208;valent iron species can be advantageous or undesirable from one system to the next. This study highlights the importance of the identity of the NHC on iron speciation upon reaction with EtMgBr, where reactions with SIMes and IMes NHCs were shown to undergo &#946; &#8208;hydride elimination more readily than those with SIPr and IPr NHCs. This insight is vital to developing new iron&#8208;NHC catalyzed transformations as understanding how to control this reduction by simply changing the NHC is central to improving the reactivity in iron&#8208;NHC catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>A photo&#8208; and redox&#8208;driven two&#8208;directional terthiazole&#8208;based switch: a combined experimental and computational investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Terthiazoles with redox&#8208;active substituents like N&#8208;methyl pyridinium group and ferrocene have been synthesized and their photo&#8208; and electro&#8208;chromic behaviors investigated. The presence of two lateral N&#8208;methyl pyridinium substituents in the structure of terthiazole proved to be effective in inducing not only the reductive ring&#8208;closure of the terthiazole core but also its oxidative ring&#8208;opening reaction, leading to the first terarylene&#8208;based switch able to fully operate both photochemically and electrochemically. Moreover, the large increase in the redox potential between its open and closed form (700 mV) means that a part of the photon energy necessary to trigger the cyclization is stored in the form of chemical potential available for other works. Introduction of a second redox&#8208;active unit such as ferrocene onto the central thiazolyl moiety is found to inhibit the photochromism of the switch but not its redox switchability which, instead, got improved for the ring&#8208;opening reaction via the redox properties of the ferrocenyl unit. The optical and redox properties of the switch in its different oxidation states are analyzed with the aid of DFT calculations in order to rationalize different switching processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Midkine Interaction with Chondroitin Sulfate&#160;Model Synthetic Tetrasaccharides and Their Mimetics: The Role of Aromatic Interactions.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Midkine (MK) is a neurotrophic factor that participates in the embryonic central nervous system (CNS) development and neural stem cell regulation, interacting with sulphated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Chondroitin sulphate (CS) is the natural ligand in the CNS. In this work, we describe the interactions between a library of synthetic models of CS&#8208;types and mimics. We did a structural study of this library by NMR and MD (Molecular Dynamics), concluding that the basic shape is controlled by similar geometry of the glycosidic linkages. Their 3D structures are a helix with four residues per turn, almost linear. We have studied the tetrasaccharide&#8208;midkine complexes by ligand observed NMR techniques and concluded that the shape of the ligands does not change upon binding. The ligand orientation into the complex is very variable. It is placed inside the central cavity of MK formed by the two structured beta&#8208;sheets domains linked by an intrinsically disordered region (IDR). Docking analysis confirmed the participation of aromatics residues from MK completed with electrostatic interactions. Finally, we test the biological activity by increasing the MK expression using CS tetrasaccharides and their capacity in enhancing the growth stimulation effect of MK in NIH3T3 cells</dc:description>

         <title>Bifunctional Polyene Cyclizations: Synthetic Studies on Pimarane Natural Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyene cyclizations generate molecular complexity from a linear polyene in a single step. While methods to initiate these cyclizations have been continuously expanded and improved over the years, the majority of polyene substrates are still limited to simple alkyl&#8208;substituted alkenes. In this study, we took advantage of the unique reactivity of higher&#8208;functionalized bifunctional alkenes. The realization of a polyene tetracyclization of a dual nucleophilic aryl enol ether involving a transannular  endo  &#8208;termination step enabled the total synthesis of the tricyclic diterpenoid pimara&#8208;15&#8208;en&#8208;3  &#945;  &#8208;8  &#945;  &#8208;diol. The highly flexible and modular route allowed for the preparation of a diverse library of cyclization precursors specifically designed for the total synthesis of the tetracyclic  nor  &#8208;diterpenoid norflickinflimiod C. The tetracyclization of three diversely substituted allenes enabled access to complex pentacyclic products and provided a detailed insight into the underlying reaction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Cation ordering and exsolution in copper&#8208;containing forms of the flexible zeolite Rho (Cu,M&#8208;Rho; M = H, Na) and their consequences for CO2 adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The flexibility of the zeolite Rho framework offers great potential for tunable molecular sieving. The fully copper&#8208;exchanged form of Rho and mixed Cu,H&#8208; and Cu,Na&#8208;forms have been prepared. EPR spectroscopy reveals Cu  2+  cations are present in the dehydrated forms and Rietveld refinement shows these prefer S6R sites, away from the  d8r  windows that control diffusion. Fully exchanged Cu&#8208;Rho remains in an open form upon dehydration, the  d8r  windows remain nearly circular and the occupancy of window sites is low, so that it adsorbs CO  2  rapidly at room temperature. Breakthrough tests with 10% CO  2  /40% CH  4  mixtures show that Cu  4.9  &#8208;Rho is able to produce pure methane, albeit with a relatively low capacity at this p  CO2  due to the weak interaction of CO  2  with Cu cations. This is in strong contrast with Na&#8208;Rho, where cations in narrow elliptical window sites enable CO  2  to be adsorbed with high selectivity and uptake but too slowly to enable the production of pure methane in similar breakthrough experiments. A series of Cu,Na&#8208;Rho materials was prepared to improve uptake and selectivity compared to Cu&#8208;Rho, and kinetics compared to Na&#8208;Rho. Remarkably, Cu,Na&#8208;Rho with &gt;2 Cu cations per unit cell exhibited exsolution, due to the preference of Na cations for narrow S8R sites in distorted Rho and of Cu cations for S6R sites in the centric, open form of Rho. The exsolved Cu,Na&#8208;Rho showed improved performance in CO  2  /CH  4  breakthrough tests, producing pure CH  4  with improved uptake and CO  2  /CH  4  selectivity compared to that of Cu  4.9  &#8208;Rho.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Substituted Tetrahydrofurans via Palladium/Rhodium Synergistic Catalyzed [3+2] Decarboxylative Cycloaddition of Vinylethylene Carbonates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unlike the comprehensive development of tandem multi&#8208;metallic catalysis, bimetallic synergistic catalysis has been challenging to achieve high stereoselectivity with the generation of multi&#8208;stereogenic centres. Herein, an efficient synergistic catalysis for the diastereo&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selective synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted tetrahydrofuran derivatives has been developed. Under mild reaction conditions, a series of target molecules with three consecutive stereocenters were synthesized by a palladium(0)/rhodium(III) bimetal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric decarboxylative [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of vinylethylene carbonates with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The corresponding adducts were obtained with moderate to high yields (67% ~ 98%) and excellent stereoselectivities (&gt; 20:1 dr, up to 99% ee).</dc:description>

         <title>(NH4)2V7O16 Micro&#8208;bricks as a Novel Anode for Aqueous Lithium&#8208;ion Battery with Good&#160;Cyclability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Searching novel anode materials to address the issues of poor cycle stability in the aqueous lithium&#8208;ion battery system is highly desirable. In this work, ammonium vanadium bronze (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  with brick&#8208;like morphology has been investigated as an anode material for aqueous lithium&#8208;ion batteries and Li  +  /Na  +  hybrid ion batteries. The two novel full cell systems, (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  // Li  2  SO  4  // LiMn  2  O  4  and (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  // Na  2  SO  4  // LiMn  2  O  4  , both demonstrate good rate capability and excellent cycling performance. The capacity retention of 78.61% after 500 cycles at 300 mA g  &#8208;1  has been demonstrated in the (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  // Li  2  SO  4  // LiMn  2  O  4  system while no capacity attenuation is observed in the (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  // Na  2  SO  4  // LiMn  2  O  4  system. The reaction mechanisms of the (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  electrode and impedance variation of the two full cells have also been researched. The excellent cycling stability suggests that the layered (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  can be a promising anode material for aqueous rechargeable lithium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemodynamic Therapy Combined with Multifunctional Nanomaterials and Their Applications in Tumor Treatment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During the past few decades, radiotherapy and chemotherapy have once been the standard approaches for tumor treatments. However, the potential toxic effect and side effects of both radiotherapy and chemotherapy on the human body still cannot be neglected. Given this, the Fenton reaction has become one of the most effective treatment strategies to combat tumor cells. This review aims to comprehensively and systematically summarize the recent advances in chemodynamic therapy (CDT) via the Fenton reaction. In addition, a host of the advanced nano&#8208;multifunctional materials and engineering bacteria used in the Fenton reaction were also summarized. This paper would be helpful to provide guidance and lay firm foundations for future tumor treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Liquids [M3+][A&#8211;]3 with Three&#8208;Valent Cations and Their Possible Use to Easily Separate Rare Earth Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We introduce a simple way to liquify rare earth metals (REM) by incorporating the corresponding cations, in particular Eu  3+  , La  3+  , and Y  3+  , into polyvalent Ionic Liquids. In contrast to conventional methods, this is achieved not by transforming them into anionic complexes, but by keeping them as bare cations and combining them with convenient, cheap and commercially available anions (A) in the form [REM  3+  ][A  &#8211;  ]  3  . To do so, we follow the COncept of Melting Point Lowering due to EThoxylation (COMPLET) with alkyl polyethylene oxide carboxylates as anions. We provide basic properties, such as glass transition temperatures, viscosities, electrical conductivities, as well as water&#8208;octanol partition constants  P  and show that these ILs have remarkably different properties, despite the similarity of their cations. In addition, we show that the ionic liquids possess interesting luminescent properties as non&#8208;conventional fluorophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Recognition of Racemic Amino Alcohols in Aqueous Solution by Chiral Metal&#8208;Oxide Keplerate {Mo132}&#8208;cluster Capsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Determining the relative configuration or enantiomeric excess of a substance may be achieved using NMR spectroscopy by employing chiral shift reagents (CSRs). Such reagents non&#8208;covalently interact with the chiral solute, resulting in each chiral form experiencing different magnetic anisotropy, which is reflected in their NMR spectra. The Keplerate polyoxometalate (POM) is a molybdenum&#8208;based, water&#8208;soluble, discrete inorganic structure with a pore&#8208;accessible inner cavity, decorated by differentiable ligands. Through ligand exchange from the self&#8208;assembled nanostructure we have synthesized a set of chiral Keplerate host molecules. By exploiting interactions of analyte molecules at the surface pores we establish the relative configuration of chiral amino alcohol guests (phenylalaninol and 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol) in aqueous solvent and determine their enantiomeric excess by  1  H NMR. The use of POMs as chiral shift reagents represents an application of the class that is yet to be well established and opens avenues into aqueous host&#8208;guest chemistry with self&#8208;assembled recognition agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Size Controlled Hapticity Switching in [Ln(C9H9)(C8H8)] Sandwiches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sandwich complexes of lanthanide have recently attracted a considerable amount of interest due to their applications as single molecule magnet (SMM). Herein, a comprehensive series of heteroleptic lanthanide sandwich complexes ligated by the cyclononatetraenyl (Cnt) and the cyclooctatetraenyl (Cot) ligand [Ln(Cot)(Cnt)] (Ln = Tb, Dy, Er, Ho, Yb, and Lu) is reported. The coordination behavior of the Cnt ligand has been investigated along the series and shows different coordination patterns in the solid&#8208;state depending on the size of the corresponding lanthanide ion without altering its overall anisotropy. Besides the characterization in the solid state by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and in solution by  1  H NMR, static magnetic studies and ab initio computational studies were performed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A metal&#8208;free photoredox&#8208;catalyzed hydrodefluorination of fluoroarenes was achieved using  N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;  &#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;  para  &#8208;phenylenediamine  (1  ) as a strong photoreduction catalyst. This reaction was applicable not only to electron&#8208;rich monofluoroarenes but also to polyfluoroarenes to afford non&#8208;fluorinated arenes. The experimental mechanistic studies indicated that the amide solvent NMP plays an important role for regeneration of the photocatalyst, enabling additive&#8208;free photoreduction catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Graphene oxide assisted covalent triazine framework for boosting photocatalytic H2 evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) with two&#8208;dimensional structures have exhibited promising visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced H2 evolution performance. However, it is still a challenge to improve its activity. Herein, we report &#960;&#8208;conjugation&#8208;linked CTF&#8208;1/GO for boosting photocatalytic H2 evolution. The CTF&#8208;1/GO hybrid material was obtained by a facile low&#8208;temperature condensation of 1,4&#8208;Dicyanobenzene in the presence of GO. The results of photocatalytic H2 evolution indicate that the optimum hybrid, CTF&#8208;1/GO&#8208;3.0, exhibited an H2 evolution rate of 2262.4 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 under visible light irradiation, which was 9 times that of pure CTF&#8208;1. The enhanced photocatalytic performance could be attributed to the GO in CTF&#8208;1/GO hybrids not only acts as an electron collector and transporter like a &#8220;bridge&#8221; to facilitate the separation and transfer of photogenerated charges but also shortens the electron migration path due to its thin sheet layer uniformly distribution over CTF&#8208;1. This work could help future development of novel conjugated CTF&#8208;based composite materials as high&#8208;efficiency photocatalyst for photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>[Ni(NHC)2] as a Scaffold for Structurally Characterized trans [H&#8208;Ni&#8208;PR2] and trans [R2P&#8208;Ni&#8208;PR2] Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Addition of PPh  2  H, PPhMeH, PPhH  2  , P(  para  &#8208;Tol)H&#173;  2  , PMesH  2  and PH  3  to the two&#8208;coordinate Ni(0) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene species [Ni(NHC)  2  ] (NHC = I  i  Pr  2  , IMe  4  , IEt  2  Me  2  ) affords a series of mononuclear, terminal phosphido Ni complexes. Structural characterisation of nine of these compounds show they exhibit unusual  trans  [H&#8208;Ni&#8208;PR  2  ] or novel  trans  [R  2  P&#8208;Ni&#8208;PR  2  ] geometries. The bis&#8208;phosphido complexes are more accessible when smaller NHCs (IMe  4  &gt; IEt  2  Me  2  &gt; I  i  Pr) and phosphines are employed. P&#8208;P activation of the diphosphines R  2  P&#8208;PR  2  (R  2  = Ph  2  , PhMe) provides an alternative route to some of the [Ni(NHC)  2  (PR  2  )  2  ] complexes. DFT calculations capture these trends with P&#8208;H bond activation proceeding from unconventional phosphine adducts in which the H substituent bridges the Ni&#8208;P bond. P&#8208;P bond activation from [Ni(NHC)  2  (Ph  2  P&#8208;PPh  2  )] adducts proceeds with computed barriers below 10 kcal/mol.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Addition of PPh  2  H, PPhMeH, PPhH  2  , P(  para  -Tol)H&#173;  2  , PMesH  2  and PH  3  to the two-coordinate Ni(0) N-heterocyclic carbene species [Ni(NHC)  2  ] (NHC = I  i  Pr  2  , IMe  4  , IEt  2  Me  2  ) affords a series of mononuclear, terminal phosphido Ni complexes. Structural characterisation of nine of these compounds show they exhibit unusual  trans  [H-Ni-PR  2  ] or novel  trans  [R  2  P-Ni-PR  2  ] geometries. The bis-phosphido complexes are more accessible when smaller NHCs (IMe  4  &amp;gt; IEt  2  Me  2  &amp;gt; I  i  Pr) and phosphines are employed. P-P activation of the diphosphines R  2  P-PR  2  (R  2  = Ph  2  , PhMe) provides an alternative route to some of the [Ni(NHC)  2  (PR  2  )  2  ] complexes. DFT calculations capture these trends with P-H bond activation proceeding from unconventional phosphine adducts in which the H substituent bridges the Ni-P bond. P-P bond activation from [Ni(NHC)  2  (Ph  2  P-PPh  2  )] adducts proceeds with computed barriers below 10 kcal/mol. The ability of the [Ni(NHC)  2  ] moiety to afford isolable terminal phosphido products reflects the stability of the Ni-NHC bond that prevents ligand dissociation and onward reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stability of AgIII towards Halides in Organosilver(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The involvement of silver in two&#8208;electron processes Ag(I/III) is currently emerging. However, the range of stability of the required and uncommon Ag(III) species is virtually unknown. Here, the stability of Ag(III) towards the whole set of halide ligands in the organosilver(III) complex frame [(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AgX]&#8315; is theoretically analyzed (X = F to At). Even the softest and least electronegative halides (I and At) are found to form reasonably stable Ag(III)&#8211;X bonds. Our estimates were confirmed by experiment. In fact, the whole series of non&#8208;radiative halide complexes [PPh&#8324;][(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AgX] (X = F to I) has been experimentally prepared and isolated in pure form. The pseudohalides [PPh&#8324;][(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AgCN] and [PPh4][(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AgN&#8323;] have also been isolated, the latter being the first silver(III) azido&#8208;complex. Except for the iodo&#8208;compound, the crystal structures have been established by X&#8208;ray diffraction methods. The decomposition paths of the [(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AgX]&#8315; entities at the unimolecular level have been examined in the gas phase by multistage mass spectrometry (MSn). The experimental detection of the two series of mixed complexes [CF&#8323;AgX]&#8315; and [FAgX]&#8315; arising from the corresponding parent species [(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AgX]&#8315; demonstrates that the Ag&#8211;X bond is particularly robust. Our experimental observations are rationalized with the aid of theoretical methods. Smooth variation with the electronegativity of X is also observed in the thermolyses of bulk samples. The experimentally established compatibility of Ag(III) with the heaviest halides is of particular relevance to silver&#8208;mediated or &#8208;catalyzed processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Ni(II) Precatalysts Enable Thioetherification of (Hetero)aryl Halides and Tosylates and Tandem C&#8208;S/C&#8208;N Couplings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;S cross&#8208;coupling reactions have received less attention compared with other C&#8208;heteroatom couplings. Most reported examples comprise the thioetherification of most reactive aryl iodides with aromatic thiols. The use of C&#8208;O electrophiles in this context is almost uncharted. Here we describe that preformed Ni(II) precatalysts of the type NiCl(allyl)(PMe  2  Ar&#8217;) (Ar&#8217; = terphenyl group) efficiently couple a wide range of (hetero)aryl halides, including challenging aryl chlorides, with a variety of aromatic and aliphatic thiols. Aryl and alkenyl tosylates are also well tolerated demonstrating, for the first time, to be competent electrophilic partners in Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;S bond formation. The chemoselective functionalization of the C&#8208;I bond in the presence of C&#8208;Cl bond allows for designing site&#8208;selective tandem C&#8208;S/C&#8208;N couplings. The formation of the two C&#8208;heteroatom bonds takes place in a single operation and represents a rare example of dual electrophile/nucleophile chemoselective process.</dc:description>

         <title>Sodium Butylated Hydroxytoluene: A Functional Group Tolerant, Eco&#8208;Friendly Base for Solvent&#8208;Free, Pd&#8208;Catalysed Amination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NaBHT, a strong, but hindered and lipophilic base, has been effectively paired with similarly lipophilic, high&#8208;reactivity Pd&#8208;NHC (N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) catalysts to produce an ideal combination for performing solvent&#8208;free (melt) cross&#8208;coupling amination. The mild nucleophilicity of NaBHT, coupled with the anti&#8208;oxidant properties of its conjugate acid byproduct, BHT means the process seems to have no functional group incompatibilities. Highly effective coupling of base&#8208;sensitive and redox&#8208;active functional groups was observed in all cases with only 0.1&#8208;0.2 mol percent catalyst. Comparisons using the standard base for this reaction, KOtBu, led to poor couplings or complete degradation in most applications &#8211; only NaBHT works.</dc:description>

         <title>Bidentate Disilicate Framework for Bis&#8208;Grafted Surface Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent advances in surface organometallic chemistry have enabled the detailed characterization of the surface species in single&#8208;site heterogeneous catalysts. However, the selective formation of bis&#8208;grafted surface species remains challenging because of the heterogeneity of the supporting surface. Herein, we introduce a metal complex bearing bidentate disilicate ligands, &#8211;OSi(O  t  Bu)  2  OSi(O  t  Bu)  2  O&#8211;, as a molecular precursor, which has a silicate framework adjacent to the metal (Pt) center. The grafting of the precursors on silica supports (MCM&#8208;41 and CARiACT Q10) proceeded through a substitution reaction on the silicon atoms of the disilicate ligand, which was verified by the detection of isobutene and  t  BuOH as the elimination products, to selectively yield bis&#8208;grafted surface species. The chemical structure of the surface species was characterized by solid&#8208;state NMR, and the chemical shift values of the ancillary ligands and  195  Pt nuclei suggested that the bidentate coordination sphere was maintained following grafting.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Recognition of Nerve Agents and Their Organophosphorus Surrogates:&#160;Toward Supramolecular Scavengers and Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nerve agents are tetrahedral organophosphorus compounds (OPs) that were developed in the last century to irreversibly inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and therefore impede neurological signaling in living organisms. Exposure to OPs leads to a rapid development of symptoms from excessive salivation, nasal congestion and chest pain to convulsion and asphyxiation which if left untreated may lead to death. These potent toxins are prepared on a large scale from inexpensive staring materials, making it feasible for terrorist groups or states to use them against military and civilians. The existing antidotes provide limited protection and are difficult to apply to a large number of affected individuals. While new prophylactics are currently being developed, there is still need for therapeutics capable of both preventing and reversing the effects of OP poisoning. In this review, we describe how the science of molecular recognition can expand the pallet of tools for rapid and safe sequestration of nerve agents.</dc:description>

In this review, we describe how the science of molecular recognition can expand the pallet of tools for rapid and safe sequestration of nerve agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Electrochemical Route for Special Oxidative Ring&#8208;Opening of Indoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel electrochemical protocol for the oxidative cleavage of indoles has been developed, which o&#64256;ers a simple way to access synthetically useful anthranilic acid derivatives. In undivided cells, a wide variety of indoles and alcohol compounds are examined to a&#64256;ord amide ester aromatics without using extra oxidants and stoichiometric metal catalysts, which avoids the formation of undesired by&#8208;products and exhibits high atom economy. The products we described in this perspective represent synthetic intermediate in numerous drug molecules and industrial chemical reagents and remarkably shows potential application in future.</dc:description>

         <title>Factors Controlling the Aluminium(I)&#8208;meta&#8208;selective C&#8722;H Activation in Arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The so far poorly understood factors controlling the complete meta&#8208;selectivity observed in the C&#8722;H activation reactions of alkylarenes promoted by aluminyl anions have been explored in detail by means of Density Functional Theory calculations. To this end, a combination of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computational methods, namely the activation strain model of reactivity and energy decomposition analysis, has been applied to quantitatively unveil the origin of the selectivity of the transformation as well as the influence of the associated potassium cation. It is found that the selectivity takes place during the initial nucleophilic addition step where the key LP(Al)&#8594;&#960;*(C=C) molecular orbital interaction is more stabilizing for the meta&#8208;pathway, which results in a stronger interaction between the reactants along the entire transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Calcination&#8208;Free Synthesis of Well&#8208;Dispersed and Sub&#8208;10 nm Spinel Ferrite Nanoparticles as High&#8208;Performance Anode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: A Case Study of CoFe2O4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spinel ferrites are promising anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) owing to their high theoretical specific capacities. However, their practical application is impeded by inherent low conductivity and severe volume expansion, which can be surpassed by increasing surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio of nanoparticles. Currently, most methods produce spinel ferrite nanoparticles with large size and severe aggregation, degrading their electrochemical performance. In this study, a low temperature aminolytic route was designed to synthesize sub&#8208;10 nm CoFe  2  O  4  nanoparticles with good dispersion through carefully exploiting the reaction of acetates and oleylamine. The performance of CoFe  2  O  4  nanoparticles obtained by traditional co&#8208;precipitation method was also investigated for comparison. This work demonstrates that CoFe  2  O  4  nanoparticles synthesized by the aminolytic route are promising as anode materials for LIBs. Besides, this method can be extended to design other spinel ferrites for energy storage devices with superior performance by simply changing the starting material, such as MnFe  2  O  4  , MgFe  2  O  4  , ZnFe  2  O  4  , and so on.</dc:description>

Currently, most methods produce spinel ferrite nanoparticles with large size and severe aggregation, degrading their electrochemical performance. In this study, a low temperature aminolytic route was designed to synthesize sub-10 nm CoFe  2  O  4  nanoparticles with good dispersion through carefully exploiting the reaction of acetates and oleylamine. The performance of CoFe  2  O  4  nanoparticles obtained by traditional co-precipitation method was also investigated for comparison.

         <title>Highly Efficient Trityl&#8208;nitroxide Biradicals for Biomolecular High&#8208;field Dynamic Nuclear Polarization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is a powerful method to enhance the sensitivity of solid&#8208;state magnetic nuclear resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy. However, its biomolecular applications at high magnetic fields (preferably &gt; 14 T) have so far been limited by the intrinsically low efficiency of polarizing agents and sample preparation aspects. Herein, we report a new class of trityl&#8208;nitroxide biradicals, dubbed SNAPols that combine high DNP efficiency with greatly enhanced hydrophilicity. SNAPol&#8208;1, the best compound in the series, shows DNP enhancement factors at 18.8 T of more than 100 in small molecules and globular proteins and also exhibits strong DNP enhancements in membrane proteins and cellular preparations. By integrating optimal sensitivity and high resolution, we expect widespread applications of this new polarizing agent in high&#8208;field DNP/ssNMR spectroscopy, especially for complex biomolecules.</dc:description>
