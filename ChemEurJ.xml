The enriching shuttling of cucurbiturils. The number and complexity of supramolecular systems featured by cucurbituril macrocycles shuttling over other molecules do not cease to increase. This concept article discusses the recent advances in the field and proposes challenges to tackle.







Abstract
Ring translocation switches and shuttles featuring a macrocycle (or a ring molecule) navigating between two or more stations continue to attract attention. While the vast majority of these systems are developed in organic solvents, the cucurbituril (CB) macrocycles are ideally suited to prepare such systems in water. Indeed, their stability and their relatively high affinity for relevant guest molecules are key attributes toward translating the progresses made in organic solvents, into water. This concept article summarizes the findings, key advances and multiple possibilities offered by CBs toward advanced molecular switches and shuttles in water.

         <title>Control of Substrate Conformation by Hydrogen Bonding in a Retaining &#946;&#8208;Endoglycosidase</title>

A hydrogen bond involving the C2 exocyclic group and the nucleophile controls substrate conformation in a glycosidase: its presence preserves sugar distortion, whereas its absence (e.g. in enzyme mutants) knocks it out.







Abstract
Bacterial &#946;&#8208;glycosidases are hydrolytic enzymes that depolymerize polysaccharides such as &#946;&#8208;cellulose, &#946;&#8208;glucans and &#946;&#8208;xylans from different sources, offering diverse biomedical and industrial uses. It has been shown that a conformational change of the substrate, from a relaxed 4C1 conformation to a distorted 1S3/1,4B conformation of the reactive sugar, is necessary for catalysis. However, the molecular determinants that stabilize the substrate's distortion are poorly understood. Here we use quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM)&#8208;based molecular dynamics methods to assess the impact of the interaction between the reactive sugar, i.&#8201;e. the one at subsite &#8722;1, and the catalytic nucleophile (a glutamate) on substrate conformation. We show that the hydrogen bond involving the C2 exocyclic group and the nucleophile controls substrate conformation: its presence preserves sugar distortion, whereas its absence (e.g. in an enzyme mutant) knocks it out. We also show that 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8208;fluoro derivatives, widely used to trap the reaction intermediates by X&#8208;ray crystallography, reproduce the conformation of the hydrolysable substrate at the experimental conditions. These results highlight the importance of the 2&#8208;OH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;nucleophile interaction in substrate recognition and catalysis in endo&#8208;glycosidases and can inform mutational campaigns aimed to search for more efficient enzymes.

&lt;p&gt;Bacterial &#946;-glycosidases are hydrolytic enzymes that depolymerize polysaccharides such as &#946;-cellulose, &#946;-glucans and &#946;-xylans from different sources, offering diverse biomedical and industrial uses.

         <title>Multigram Synthesis of Dimethyl Stellane&#8208;1,5&#8208;Dicarboxylate as a Key Precursor for ortho&#8208;Benzene Mimics
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 70, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
From a new C(sp3)&#8208;rich hydrocarbon cage, a potential ortho&#8208;substituted benzene analogue (bioisoster), up to 50&#8197;g of tricyclo[3.3.0.03,7]octane (stellane) 1,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid derivatives can be produced in one run. The outcome of the synthesis hinges on the substrate's stereochemistry. While the endo,endo DMOD isomer only undergoes epimerization in the reaction conditions, others yield the sought&#8208;after stellane ester. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis shows stellane 1,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester as an ideal saturated alternative for ortho&#8208;disubstituted benzene with in&#8208;plane topology.







Abstract
Herein, we present previously unavailable C(sp3)&#8208;rich polycyclic hydrocarbon scaffolds that have the potential to become valuable tools in medicinal chemistry and crop science as saturated bioisosteres of benzenoids. We have developed a scalable protocol (up to 50&#8197;g from a single synthetic run) for the synthesis of tricyclo[3.3.0.03,7]octane (bisnoradamantane or stellane) 1,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid derivatives. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of the stellane 1,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester has revealed that this scaffold is an optimal saturated isostere for ortho&#8208;disubstituted benzene where substituents exhibit in&#8208;plane topology. The synthetic protocol is based on the oxidative cyclization of dimethyl octahydropentalene&#8208;2,5&#8208;dicarboxylate (DMOD) through lithiation followed by I2 oxidation. The reaction outcome is determined by the stereochemistry of the substrate. While the endo,endo cis&#8208;DMOD, exclusively gives the &#8220;unwanted&#8221; Claisen cyclization product, the exo,endo cis&#8208; and exo,exo cis&#8208; stereoisomers afford the desired stellane 1,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester quantitatively. DFT computations have revealed that the reaction proceeds via the dianion of dimethyl octahydropentalene&#8208;2,5&#8208;dicarboxylate, which undergoes SET oxidation by I2 to form a radical anion. The subsequent cyclization followed by a second SET oxidation gives the desired stellane derivative.

         <title>Neutral Silylyne Complex of Molybdenum: Synthesis, Properties, and Access to Silaiminoacyl Complexes via [2+3] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 70, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A neutral silylyne complex of molybdenum was synthesized and its properties including cycloaddition reactions with alkynes and organic azides were studied. The first silicon version of iminoacyl complexes, i.&#8201;e., silaiminoacyl complexes were obtained by the [2+3] cycloaddition with organic azides. The novel structural and bonding aspects were revealed by X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis and DFT calculations.







Abstract
A neutral silylyne complex of molybdenum was synthesized by the stepwise dehydrogenation method and its properties were compared with those of the tungsten analog. The complex takes a dimeric form as crystals but afford a monomer&#8208;dimer equilibrium in solution. The replacement of the central metal from W to Mo led to a monomer dominant (~98&#8201;%) solution at room temperature. The monomer&#8208;dimer dynamics was investigated based on thermodynamic parameters. The molybdenum silylyne complex underwent [2+2] cycloaddition with alkynes much faster than the tungsten analog. The reactions with organic azides led to the formation of the first example of silaiminoacyl complexes through [2+3] cycloaddition. The structures and bonding aspects of the products were clarified by multiple measurements and DFT calculations.

The four phenyl groups of 2 were partially replaced by chlorine atom(s) by successive treatment with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH) and lithium chloride, whereas replacement of all phenyl groups was carried out with hydrogen chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride.







Abstract
The four phenyl groups of 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;2,2,4,4&#8208;tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)cyclotetrasilane were partially replaced by chlorine atom(s) by successive treatment with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and lithium chloride. The replacement of all phenyl groups was carried out with hydrogen chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride. The structural features of the resulting mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tetrachlorocyclotetrasilanes were compared by X&#8208;ray crystallography.

         <title>Concentration&#8208; and Solvent&#8208;Induced Chiral Tuning by Manipulating Non&#8208;Proteinogenic Amino Acids in Glycoconjugate Supra&#8208;Scaffolds: Interaction with Protein, and Streptomycin Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 70, December 14, 2023. </description>

Cbz&#8208;Protected non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids L&#8208;phenylglycine and 4&#8208;Nitro&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine were chemically attached with D&#8208;glucosamine to fabricate biomimetic, non&#8208;immunogenic, non&#8208;allergic, biocompatible, and ambidextrous supergelators. The fibrous assemblies of the gelators revealed solvent&#8208; and concentration&#8208;triggered chiral alteration. Highly entangled helical fiber formation was observed in the microscopic images. Further, antibacterial activity by the streptomycin&#8208;loaded hydrogel, interaction with protein, and cell attachment were also demonstrated.







Abstract
We showed solvent&#8208; and concentration&#8208;triggered chiral tuning of the fibrous assemblies of two novel glycoconjugates Z&#8208;P(Gly)&#8208;Glu and Z&#8208;F(4&#8208;N)&#8208;Glu made by chemical attachment of Cbz&#8208;protected [short as Z)] non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids L&#8208;phenylglycine [short as P(Gly)] and 4&#8208;Nitro&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine [short as F(4&#8208;N)] with D&#8208;glucosamine [short as Glu]. Both biomimetic gelators can form self&#8208;healing and shape&#8208;persistent gels with a very low critical gelator concentration in water as well as in various organic solvents, indicating they are ambidextrous supergelators. Detailed spectroscopic studies suggested &#946;&#8208;sheet secondary structure formation during anisotropic self&#8208;aggregation of the gelators which resulted in the formation of hierarchical left&#8208;handed helical fibers in acetone with an interlayer spacing of 2.4&#8197;nm. After the physical characterization of the gels, serum protein interaction with the gelators was assessed, indicating they may be ideal for biomedical applications. Further, both gelators are benign, non&#8208;immunogenic, non&#8208;allergenic, and non&#8208;toxic in nature, which was confirmed by performing the blood parameters and liver function tests on Wister rats. Streptomycin&#8208;loaded hydrogels showed efficacious antibacterial activity in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo as well. Finally, cell attachment and biocompatibility of the hydrogels were demonstrated which opens a newer avenue for promising biomedical and therapeutic applications.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Catalytic Activity of (Cyclopentadienone)iron Complexes Containing a Stereogenic Plane and a Stereogenic Axis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 70, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Winning plane: chiral (cyclopentadienone)iron complexes (CICs) featuring a combination of an (R)&#8208;BINOL&#8208;derived stereoaxis and a stereogenic plane were synthesized in diastereoisomerically pure form, characterized and tested in the asymmetric hydrogenation of ketones. The new CICs showed good catalytic activity and, remarkably, the stereoplane epimers displayed similar and opposite stereochemical preference.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of several chiral (cyclopentadienone)iron complexes (CICs) featuring either two (R)&#8208;BINOL&#8208;derived stereoaxes or a combination of one (R)&#8208;BINOL&#8208;derived stereoaxis and a stereogenic plane. The stereoplane&#8208;containing CICs were obtained as epimer mixtures, which were separated by flash column chromatography and assigned an absolute configuration based on XRD analysis, NMR and order of elution. The library was tested in the asymmetric hydrogenation of ketones showing good catalytic activity and a moderate stereoselectivity which, notably, is mostly imparted by the stereogenic plane. Indeed, the two epimers of each CIC possessing a stereoplane show opposite and equally strong stereochemical preference.

         <title>Engineering a Cl&#8208;&#8208;Modulated Light&#8208;Driven Na+ Pump</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 70, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Na+&#8208;pumping rhodopsin modulated by Cl&#8722; has been developed. Na+, competing with H+, is taken up from the cytoplasmic surface, translocates across the retinal, and reaches the site coordinated by Asp116, Ser70, and Asn112. This process is specifically promoted by Cl&#8722; when an extracellular Glu160 is replaced by a glutamine.







Abstract
Microbial Na+&#8208;pumping rhodopsin (NaR) is a promising optogenetic tool due to its unique ability to transport Na+. Like most rhodopsin&#8208;based tools, NaR is limited to light&#8208;based control. In this study, our objective was to develop a novel mode of modulation for NaR beyond light control. By introducing a potential Cl&#8722; binding site near the putative Na+ release cavity, we engineered Nonlabens dokdonensis rhodopsin 2 (NdR2) to be modulated by Cl&#8722;, an essential chemical in organisms. The engineered NdR2 demonstrated an approximately two&#8208;fold increase in Na+ pump activity in the presence of 100&#8197;mM Cl&#8722; compared to Cl&#8208;&#8208;free solution. Increasing Cl&#8722; concentration decreased the lifetimes of the M and O intermediates accordingly. The analysis of competitive ion uptake suggested the bound Cl&#8722; may increase the Na+ affinity and selectivity. This chemical modulation allows for more diverse and precise control over cellular processes, advancing the development of next&#8208;generation optogenetic tools. Notably, our Cl&#8208;&#8208;modulated NdR2 establishes an innovative mechanism for linking Cl&#8722; to Na+&#8208;related processes, with potential applications in optogenetic therapies for related diseases.

         <title>Complexation&#8208;Triggered Fluctuation of &#960;&#8208;Conjugation on an Antiaromatic Dicyanoanthracene Dianion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 70, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reduction of a bisboron complex consisting of 9,10&#8208;dicyanoanthracene and two equivalents of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane has also been studied. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and theoretical calculations revealed a decrease in antiaromaticity upon Lewis adduct formation. The outer rings acquired aromaticity upon reduction, and the central ring turned into a nonaromatic quinoidal structure. Furthermore, a B&#8722;N&#8722;C angle&#8208;dependent change in antiaromaticity was suggested by a scan of the NICS(1) calculation. Dianion 2 exhibited chemiluminescence upon exposure to an oxygen atmosphere.







Abstract
The formation of Lewis pairs is an important chemical concept. Recently, the complexation of Lewis acidic tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane with Lewis basic moieties and subsequent reduction has emerged as a fascinating strategy for designing novel reactions and structures. The impact of the complexation and subsequent reduction of antiaromatic systems bearing Lewis base moieties has been investigated. We found how Lewis adduct formation stabilizes an antiaromatic system consisting of 9,10&#8208;dicyanoanthracene and tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane by using synthesis, X&#8208;ray crystallography, spectroscopic analysis, and quantum chemical calculations.

&lt;p&gt;The reduction of a bisboron complex consisting of 9,10-dicyanoanthracene and two equivalents of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane has also been studied. X-ray crystallographic analysis and theoretical calculations revealed a decrease in antiaromaticity upon Lewis adduct formation. The outer rings acquired aromaticity upon reduction, and the central ring turned into a nonaromatic quinoidal structure. Furthermore, a B&#8722;N&#8722;C angle-dependent change in antiaromaticity was suggested by a scan of the NICS(1) calculation. Dianion &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; exhibited chemiluminescence upon exposure to an oxygen atmosphere.

         <title>PI and PIII Ions Supported by BZIMPY Ligands</title>

A series of dicationic Lewis acids is reported, featuring PIII&#8722;X fragments supported by substituted 2,6&#8208;bis(benzimidazole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine (BZIMPY) ligands that are readily converted to the corresponding PI salts, which can be oxidized to regenerate the PIII&#8722;X dications. The PIII&#8722;X dications are shown to be strong Lewis acids both experimentally and computationally and to readily behave as X+, PX, and P+ transfer agents in reactions with phosphines, NHCs, and diazabutadienes. The related PI cations are shown to be very effective P+ transfer agents when treated similarly.







Abstract
We report a class of compounds in which both PIII&#8722;X and PI forms featuring the same ligand are stable and readily cycled with each other. A series of PIII&#8722;X (X=Cl, Br, I) dicationic triflate salts supported by benzyl&#8208; and allyl&#8208;substituted 2,6&#8208;bis(benzimidazole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine (BZIMPY) ligands is synthesized. Surprisingly, treatment of these with R3PO (R=Et, Oct) results in reduction to BZIMPY&#8208;ligated PI monocationic triflate salts while treatment with Ph3P reduces but also substitutes the compound to produce Ph3P&#8208;BZIMPY&#8208;ligated PI dicationic triflate salts. The mechanisms of these surprising reductions are probed experimentally and rationalized computationally. The PIII&#8722;X dications are shown to be strong Lewis acids both experimentally and computationally and to readily behave as X+, PX, and P+ transfer agents in reactions with phosphines, NHCs, and diazabutadienes. The PI mono&#8208; and dications are shown to be very effective P+ transfer agents when treated similarly. Oxidation from a monocationic PI salt back to the dicationic PIII&#8722;X (X=Cl, Br) salt was achieved by treatment with N&#8208;chlorosuccinimide (NCS) or N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS). Full characterization is reported using multinuclear nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry where suitable crystals were isolated.

         <title>Formation and Growth of Atomic Scale Seeds of Au Nanoparticle in the Nanospace of an Organic Cage Molecule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 70, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although it is recently becoming possible to observe the nucleation of clusters with only a few metal atoms by TEM, it is challenging to control their formation and growth in a homogeneous solution system to synthesize metal nanoparticles. This work presents a new synthetic concept for metal nanoparticles utilizing an organic cage molecule which regulates both the formation and growth of seeds composing of only a few Au(0) atoms.







Abstract
Seed&#8208;mediated growth has been widely used to synthesize noble metal nanoparticles with controlled size and shape. Although it is becoming possible to directly observe the nucleation process of metal atoms at the single atom level by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), it is challenging to control the formation and growth of seeds with only a few metal atoms in homogeneous solution systems. This work reports site&#8208;selective formation and growth of atomic scale seeds of the Au nanoparticle in a nanospace of an organic cage molecule. We synthesized a cage molecule with amines and phenols, which were found to both capture and reduce Au(III) ions to spontaneously form the atomic scale seeds containing Au(0) in the nanospace. The growth reaction of the atomic scale seeds afforded Au nanoparticles with an average diameter of 2.0&#177;0.2&#8197;nm, which is in good agreement with the inner diameter of the cage molecule.

         <title>Carbon Dioxide Hydrogenation to Formate Catalyzed by a Neutral, Coordinatively Saturated Tris&#8208;Carbonyl Mn(I)&#8208;PNP Pincer&#8208;Type Complex</title>

To MLC or not to MLC? CO2 hydrogenation to formate was achieved under mild conditions of pressure and temperature in the presence of a neutral Mn(I) pincer&#8208;type tris(carbonyl) catalyst that does not require metal&#8208;ligand cooperation (MLC).







Abstract
CO2 catalytic hydrogenation to formate was achieved (TONmax=ca.&#8197;3800) in the presence of the neutral, halide&#8208;free, coordinatively saturated tris(carbonyl) manganese pincer&#8208;type complex [Mn(PNP)(CO)3], bearing a diarylamido pincer&#8208;type PNP ligand, using DBU as base and LiOTf as Lewis acid additive, under mild reaction conditions (60&#8197;bar, 80&#8201;&#176;C). DFT calculations suggest that the precatalyst activation key step occurs by intermolecular, base assisted dihydrogen heterolytic splitting rather than by the expected ligand&#8208;assisted intramolecular MLC&#8208;type mechanism.

Bicyclophane&#8208;based molecular platforms form extended 2D crystalline monolayers after adsorption from solution onto HOPG and contain orthogonal pillars that point towards the supernatant solution phase.







Abstract
The modular synthesis of a series of nanoscale phenylene bicyclophanes with an intraannular orthogonal pillar is described. The compounds are obtained by a Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling condensation and are characterized by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy as well as in&#8197;situ scanning tunneling microscopy at the solid/liquid interface of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite. In addition, their structures and conformations are supported by quantum chemical calculations, also after adsorption to the substrate. A set of two alkyl chain substitution patterns as well as a combination of both were investigated with respect to their ability to form extended 2D&#8208;crystalline superstructures on graphite. It shows that not the most densely packed surface coverage gives the most stable structure, but the largest number of alkyl chains per molecule determines the structural robustness to alterations at the pillar functionality.

Radical cation species of cyclic [3]spirobifluorenylene with bulky alkyl groups at the ends was designed and prepared to investigate the electron transfer phenomena in a &#960;&#8208;conjugated system including orthogonal &#960;&#8208;conjugated chains. The spin delocalization in the whole molecule due to intramolecular electron transfer was revealed by both calculation and experiments.







Abstract
Cyclic [3]spirobifluorenylene with bulky alkyl groups at the ends (1) was designed and synthesized to investigate the electron transfer phenomena in a &#960;&#8208;conjugated system including orthogonal &#960;&#8208;conjugated chains. The three bifluorenyl units in 1 are conjugated to each other via spiro&#8208;conjugation, resulting in the splitting of the HOMO levels to a small extent. Therefore, the SOMO&#8208;HOMO gap of the radical cation species is small, which is considered to allow the facile intramolecular electron transfer. The electronic properties of 1 and its partial structures were characterized by absorption and fluorescence measurements and electrochemical analysis. From the electrochemical oxidation, the interchain Coulombic repulsion was observed. In the TD&#8208;DFT calculations for the radical cation species of 1, the geometry&#8208;featured interchain electronic transitions were visualized by NTO calculations. The radical cation species of 1 generated by chemical oxidation with SbCl5 exhibited a broadened and lower&#8208;energy NIR absorption band exceeding 2000 nm. Considering the results of the TD&#8208;DFT calculations, the NIR band of the radical cation of 1 was attributed to the intramolecular electron transfer processes among the bifluorenyl units in the macrocycle. ESR experiments also indicated the delocalization of a spin of 1&#8901;+ in the whole molecule via hole hopping in the ESR time scale at room temperature. This work demonstrates the usefulness of spiro&#8208;conjugation as a bridging unit in molecular wires to facilitate smooth electron transfer.

Easily accessible crosslinking ethynylbenziodazolone (EBZ) JW&#8208;AM&#8208;005 enables the conjugation of peptides and proteins through the selective linkage of cysteine residues. Peptide dimers or stapled peptides were obtained under mild and tuneable conditions. The rebridging of antibody fragments was also performed in a one&#8208;pot three&#8208;reaction process with high regioselectivity, outperforming the standard reagents commonly used for this transformation.







Abstract
Peptide and protein bioconjugation sees ever&#8208;growing applications in the pharmaceutical sector. Novel strategies and reagents that can address the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity issues inherent to these biomolecules, while delivering stable and functionalizable conjugates, are therefore needed. Herein, we introduce the crosslinking ethynylbenziodazolone (EBZ) reagent JW&#8208;AM&#8208;005 for the conjugation of peptides and proteins through the selective linkage of cysteine residues. This easily accessed compound gives access to peptide dimers or stapled peptides under mild and tuneable conditions. Applied to the antibody fragment of antigen binding (Fab) species, JW&#8208;AM&#8208;005 delivered rebridged proteins in a one&#8208;pot three&#8208;reaction process with high regioselectivity, outperforming the standard reagents commonly used for this transformation.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent C&#8208;H Olefination of Imidazo[1,2a]pyridine Carboxamide and Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 70, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method for regiodivergent C&#8722;H olefination of Imidazo [1,2a] pyridine carboxamide and unactivated alkenes has been developed. This protocol works for a diverse range of Imidazo [1,2a] pyridine carboxamide derivatives and various aliphatic alkenes and styrenes. The success of this chemistry is supported by experimental and computational mechanistic studies, making it a promising solution for a long&#8208;standing synthetic challenge in organic chemistry.







Abstract
Despite remarkable successes in linear and branched vinyl (hetero) arene synthesis, regiodivergent C&#8722;H olefination with a single catalytic system has remained underdeveloped. Overcoming this limitation, a Pd/MPAA&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent C&#8722;H olefination of imidazo[1,2a] pyridine carboxamides with unactivated terminal alkenes to generate branched and linear olefinated products depending upon the electronic nature of alkenes is reported herein. Moreover, this protocol can be applied for C&#8722;H deuteriation of the corresponding heteroarenes with D2O as deuterium source. Preliminary experimental studies combined with computational investigations (DFT studies) suggest that regiodivergent olefination can be controlled by olefin insertion and &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination steps.

         <title>Dioxygen Activation and Reduction by a Soluble Iron Phthalocyanine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 70, December 14, 2023. </description>

Catalytic Oxygen activation by square planar iron. A well soluble phthalocyanine derivative stabilizes a square planar Fe2+ centre with S=1 paramagnetism. The bulky substituents prevent the formation of aggregates while leaving a large cavity at the metal for stoichiometric and catalytic reactions. The compound can be used as a molecular model for studying dioxygen reduction and catalytic oxygenation.







Abstract
Iron ions in a square&#8208;planar coordination can bind molecules at the vacant axial positions and are able to transform them in stoichiometric and catalytic reactions. Nature takes advantage of these properties by incorporating iron into porphyrin systems, which play a key role not only in the binding and transport of oxygen, but also in catalytic oxidation and reduction reactions involving cytochrome P450. Although these systems have been studied extensively, there are still unresolved questions regarding the interplay between the iron ions and the surrounding ligands. Phthalocyanines (Pc) create a similar environment for metal atoms and FePc is known for a long time. However, without axial ligands FePc aggregates leading to solids of low solubility. In this work we used a known six&#8208;coordinate iron phthalocyanine derivative with bulky substituents and removed the stabilizing axial ligands. The resulting paramagnetic, four&#8208;coordinate compound does not aggregate and dissolves well so that NMR spectroscopy can be employed for studying the molecular structure and the reactivity. Solvent molecules bind weakly to the iron centers and oxygen is reduced in the presence of H&#8208;atom donors. The stoichiometric and catalytic reactivity with oxygen was studied in more detail.

         <title>A Three&#8208;Dimensional (3D) Framework of Freestanding Vanadium Nitride Nanowires for Dendrite&#8208;Free and Long Life&#8208;Span Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 70, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Freestanding vanadium nitride (VN) nanowires are established as Li host for Li metal anode. A lithiophilic Li3N interlayer is in&#8197;situ formed by the surface reaction between molten Li and VN. As a result, the VN&#8722;Li exhibits a dendrite&#8208;free morphology and significant improvements of the lifespan during cycling.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal is a promising anode candidate for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries owing to its high theoretical capacity and low electrochemical potential. However, uneven Li nucleation, uncontrollable dendritic growth, infinite voltage change and even safety issues hinder its commercial application. Herein, a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) framework of freestanding vanadium nitride nanowires (VN NWs) is established as Li host for dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anode. A lithiophilic Li3N interlayer which in&#8197;situ formed by the surface reaction between molten Li and VN NWs is utilized to guide a uniform Li nucleation and deposition within the skeleton, as well as avoid the dendrite formation. Meanwhile, VN NWs can decrease local current density, homogenize Li&#8208;ion flux and accommodate volume fluctuations of the anode due to its 3D structure with high electron conductivity. Thus, the corresponding composite Li metal anode delivers a long&#8208;life span of 500&#8197;cycles (1000&#8197;h) at a current density of 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and exhibits lower nucleation over&#8208;potential and voltage hysteresis at different current densities from 0.5~5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in carbonate electrolyte. In conclusion, this work provides a new type of scaffold with both high electronic conductivity and excellent lithiophilicity for stable Li anodes.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Freestanding vanadium nitride (VN) nanowires&lt;/b&gt; are established as Li host for Li metal anode. A lithiophilic Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N interlayer is in&#8197;situ formed by the surface reaction between molten Li and VN. As a result, the VN&#8722;Li exhibits a dendrite-free morphology and significant improvements of the lifespan during cycling.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium (Li) metal is a promising anode candidate for high-energy-density batteries owing to its high theoretical capacity and low electrochemical potential. However, uneven Li nucleation, uncontrollable dendritic growth, infinite voltage change and even safety issues hinder its commercial application. Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) framework of freestanding vanadium nitride nanowires (VN NWs) is established as Li host for dendrite-free Li metal anode. A lithiophilic Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N interlayer which in&#8197;situ formed by the surface reaction between molten Li and VN NWs is utilized to guide a uniform Li nucleation and deposition within the skeleton, as well as avoid the dendrite formation. Meanwhile, VN NWs can decrease local current density, homogenize Li-ion flux and accommodate volume fluctuations of the anode due to its 3D structure with high electron conductivity. Thus, the corresponding composite Li metal anode delivers a long-life span of 500&#8197;cycles (1000&#8197;h) at a current density of 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and exhibits lower nucleation over-potential and voltage hysteresis at different current densities from 0.5~5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in carbonate electrolyte. In conclusion, this work provides a new type of scaffold with both high electronic conductivity and excellent lithiophilicity for stable Li anodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Indacenopicene&#8208;based Buckybowl Catcher for Recognition of Fullerenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 70, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel type of buckycatcher based on two bowl&#8208;shaped bromoindacenopicene moieties was synthesized and characterized by NMR and mass spectrometry. DFT calculations show a shape fit of the catcher cavity for fullerene binding. Interactions were confirmed for C60 and C70 utilizing NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).







Abstract
A novel buckybowl catcher with an extended &#960;&#8208;surface has been synthesized via cross&#8208;coupling of two bowl shaped bromoindacenopicene moieties with a tolyl linker. The obtained catcher has been unambiguously characterized by 2D&#8208;NMR and mass spectrometry. DFT calculations indicate that the curved shape of the receptor moieties is favourable for binding fullerenes. Effective binding was confirmed for interactions with C60 and C70 utilizing NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The resulting binding values show a higher affinity of the catcher towards C70 over C60. The designed catcher demonstrated the fundamental possibility of creating sensors for spherical aromaticity.

         <title>DNA Chimeras as Electrochemical Biosensors for Host&#8208;Guest Measurements in Blood</title>

Sensing in real blood: We developed a new class of sensors by covalently modifying an electrode&#8208;bound DNA with cyclobis&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene (i.&#8201;e., blue box), an electroactive host molecule that binds to small electron&#8208;rich aromatic molecules. Our sensors are rapid (&lt;5 min), single&#8208;step, reagentless, and afford continuous and stable measurements (&gt;3 days) of guest molecules at physiologically relevant concentrations directly in undiluted bovine whole&#8208;blood.







Abstract
Few sensing platforms have become ubiquitous to enable rapid and convenient measurements at the point&#8208;of&#8208;care. Those, however, are &#8220;one&#8208;off&#8221; technologies, meaning that they can only detect a single target and are hardly adaptable. In response, we plan to develop a sensing platform that can be extended to detect other classes of molecules and that affords rapid, convenient, continuous measurements directly in undiluted complex matrices. For this, we decided to rely on a host molecule that presents reversible interactions toward specific guest molecules to develop a new class of sensors that we coined &#8220;Electrochemical DNA&#8208;host chimeras&#8221;. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for our sensor, we decided to use cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene) (&#8220;blue box&#8221;) that we attached on an electrode&#8208;bound DNA to allow measurements of electron&#8208;rich guests such as dopamine and aspirin. Doing so allows to promote host&#8208;guest complex that could be quantified using blue box's electrochemistry. Because of this unique sensor architecture, we achieve, to our knowledge, the first reagentless, continuous and rapid (&lt;5 min) host&#8208;guest measurements in undiluted whole blood. We envision that given the library of electroactive host molecules that this will allow the development of a sensing platform for measurements of several classes of molecules in complex matrices at the point&#8208;of&#8208;care.

         <title>Impact of Truncation on Optoelectronic Properties of Azaborole Helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 70, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Removal of C=C bonds from azabora[7]helicenes strongly impacts their optoelectronic properties. The truncated compounds show photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 0.53 in the solid state and phosphorescence with lifetimes of up to ~0.5&#8197;s. A methyl complex of azabora[7]helicene was used as a chiral inducer embedded in an emissive polymer (F8BT) to produce CP&#8208;OLEDs with gEL of 0.54.







Abstract
Herein, we report configurationally stable singly&#8208;truncated (ST) and structurally flexible doubly&#8208;truncated (DT) helically chiral compounds derived from azabora[7]helicenes by a hypothetical removal of a single or two C=C double bonds. The singly&#8208;truncated constitutional isomers were synthesized from either benzoisoquinoline (BIQ) or phenantherene building blocks and the corresponding biaryls in excellent yields to give azabora[5]helicenes with a pendant phenyl ring at a sterically hindered position. These systems highlight the electronic impact of the nitrogen donor substitution position. The compounds with a disrupted BIQ moiety (STN) possess remarkable photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 0.53 in the solid state and a blue emission in solution with dissymmetry factors of up to ca. 3&#215;10&#8722;3. Upon cooling to 79&#8197;K all compounds exhibit phosphorescence with lifetimes of up to ca. 0.5&#8197;s. A methyl complex of azabora[7]helicene showing excellent configurational stability was used as a chiral inducer embedded in an emissive polymer (F8BT) to produce circularly polarized organic light emitting diodes with an electroluminescence dissymmetry factor gEL of up to 0.54.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization of Yndiamides with Isoxazoles via &#945;&#8208;Imino Gold Fischer Carbenes</title>

Gold&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] aminative cyclization of yndiamides and isoxazoles affords polysubstituted diaminopyrroles via the intermediacy of an &#945;&#8208;imino gold Fischer carbene. The reaction proceeds rapidly under mild conditions; high regioselectivity was achieved via a subtle steric bias between the nitrogen substituents, as supported by DFT calculations. The reaction outcome could be switched to 1,4&#8208;oxazepines by using benzisoxazoles as substrates.







Abstract
Gold catalysis is an important method for alkyne functionalization. Here we report the gold&#8208;catalyzed formal [3+2] aminative cyclization of yndiamides and isoxazoles in a direct synthesis of polysubstituted diaminopyrroles, which are important motifs in drug discovery. Key to this process is the formation, and subsequent cyclization, of an &#945;&#8208;imino gold Fischer carbene, which represents a new type of gold carbene intermediate. The reaction proceeds rapidly under mild conditions, with high regioselectivity being achieved by introducing a subtle steric bias between the nitrogen substituents on the yndiamide. DFT calculations revealed that the key to this regioselectivity was the interconversion of isomeric gold keteniminiun ions via a low&#8208;barrier &#960;&#8208;complex transition state, which establishes a Curtin&#8208;Hammett scenario for isoxazole addition. By using benzisoxazoles as substrates, the reaction outcome could be switched to a formal [5+2] cyclization, leading to 1,4&#8208;oxazepines.

         <title>Halogen Bonding in Brominated BODIPY Crystals: a Crystallographic and Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 70, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intermolecular interactions, in particular halogen bonds (XB) in BODIPYs, were analyzed with the increasing number of bromine atoms. Monocoordinated and bifurcated halogen bonds were found, and a rhombic&#8208;like structure was formed by XB interactions. Computational analyses and fingerprint plots showed that there is an increase in Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br contacts contributions that depend on the number of bromine atoms.







Abstract
The study of halogen bonds (XBs) has been a subject of great interest in recent years due to its clear application in catalysis, liquid crystals, and crystal engineering. In this study, we analyzed the intermolecular interactions, in particular halogen bonds in BODIPYs with an increasing number of bromine atoms. The computational study included analyses through three different methods: the first approach of close contacts provided by mercury, then the expanded approach of the electron density partition of the molecules in the crystals provided by the analysis of Hirshfeld surfaces, and finally, the approach of the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QT&#8208;AIM) to characterize the non&#8208;covalent interactions through finding electron density critical points between atoms and between neighboring molecules. The use of different computational methods allowed to gain insight into the interactions directing the crystal packing as the number of bromine atoms increased in the BODIPY moiety. Monocoordinated and bifurcated halogen bonds involving halide/halide were found. The penta&#8208;brominated BODIPY showed four&#8208;center cyclic nodes where each node is linked via XBs. This kind of motif can be useful in supramolecular chemistry and self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>Deinterpenetration of IRMOF&#8208;9.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 70, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new synthesis of deinterpenetrated IRMOF&#8208;9 (IRMOF&#8208;10) is reported using a bromide&#8208;mediated deinterpenetration of IRMOF&#8208;9 via dissolution of the second interpenetrating network. A combination of gas sorption, X&#8208;ray diffraction, and dye exclusion tests corroborate the synthesis of a deinterpenetrated IRMOF&#8208;9 product.







Abstract
One of the iconic characteristics of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is the possesssion of guest&#8208;accessible pores. Increasing pore size has a direct and often beneficial impact on a MOF's adsorption and separation properties. However, as pore size increases, the resulting void spaces are often filled by interpenetrated frameworks, where one or more networks crystallize within the pore system of another identical network, reducing the MOF's free volume and pore size. Furthermore, due to the thermodynamic favorability of interpenetration during solvothermal synthesis, techniques to synthetically differentiate interpenetrated from non&#8208;interpenetrated MOFs are paramount. This study reports the synthesis of deinterpenetrated IRMOF&#8208;9 via halide mediated deinterpenetrative conversion of Zn4O&#8208;derived IRMOF&#8208;9. IRMOF&#8208;9, when treated with ethylammonium bromide, is quasi&#8208;selectively etched, revealing the non&#8208;interpenetrated analogue, IRMOF&#8208;10 (deinterpenetrated IRMOF&#8208;9), which can be isolated prior to complete dissolution by the bromide solution. Dye adsorption, surface area and pore size distribution analysis, and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction are consistent with successful deinterpenetration.

         <title>Synthesis of Functional Isosorbide&#8208;Based Polyesters and Polyamides by Passerini Three&#8208;Component Polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 70, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Passerini Three&#8208;Component polymerization was employed to synthesize functional isosorbide&#8208;based polyesters and polyamides using dicarboxylic acid modified isosorbide. By precisely controlling the backbone structure and side groups, a series of functional polymers were successfully obtained, thereby establishing a versatile platform for the production of isosorbide&#8208;based polymers.







Abstract
Environmental issues are becoming more and more prominent, and bio&#8208;based polymers are essential to alleviate environmental degradation by replacing traditional polymers. With this context, a new family of functional isosorbide&#8208;based polyesters and polyamides with high glass transition temperature are prepared via Passerini&#8208;Three component polymerization (P&#8208;3CP). To optimize the P&#8208;3CP conditions, the influence of the polymerization solvent, temperature, feed ratio on the molar mass of final polymers are investigated. The higher molar mass (up to 10100&#8197;g/mol) and yield (&gt;70&#8201;%) are achieved under very mild conditions (30&#8201;&#176;C, standard atmosphere). Functional side groups, such as alkenyl, alkynyl and methyl ester, were introduced into polymer structure via P&#8208;3CP by using functional isocyanides. The obtained polyesters and polyamides are characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared (IR) spectroscopies, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). All polymers are thermal stable and amorphous with variable glass transition temperatures (Tg). The obtained polyester has Tg up to 87.5&#8201;&#176;C, while the Tg of polyamides (ISPA&#8208;2) is detected to be 97.5&#8201;&#176;C depending on the amide bonds in the polymer backbone and the benzene ring side groups. The cytotoxicity is investigated by the CCK&#8208;8 assay against mBMSC cells to confirm the biological safety. Overall, this novel strategy provides an efficient approach to produce functional isosorbide&#8208;based polyesters and polyamides, which are promising prospect for being applied to biodegradable materials.

Amides can be converted into gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes. The reaction involves interaction of &#945;&#8208;chloroiminium salts with difluorinated phosphorus ylide formed from difluorocarbene and triphenylphosphine.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot process for the gem&#8208;difluoroolefination of amides is described. The reaction is based on interaction of generated in&#8197;situ &#945;&#8208;chloroiminium salts with difluorinated phosphorus ylide formed from difluorocarbene and triphenylphosphine. The olefination involves nucleophile&#8208;assisted dephosphorylation and proceeds within one hour at low temperature. The gem&#8208;difluoroenamines were used in further transformations leading to a variety of fluoroalkylated amines.

         <title>Site Selectivity of Peptoids as Azobenzene Scaffold for Molecular Solar Thermal Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 70, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptoids are introduced as programmable macromolecular scaffold to improve the solar energy storage properties of azobenzene. The anchoring position of the chromophore strongly affects the thermal back&#8208;isomerization kinetics with the longest half&#8208;life measured in this work (14&#8197;days) being larger than that of the isolated azobenzene unit (from 2 to 4&#8197;days).







Abstract
Storing solar energy is a key challenge in modern science. MOlecular Solar Thermal (MOST) systems, in particular those based on azobenzene switches, have received great interest in the last decades. The energy storage properties of azobenzene (t1/2&lt;4&#8197;days; &#916;H~270&#8197;kJ/kg) must be improved for future applications. Herein, we introduce peptoids as programmable supramolecular scaffolds to improve the energy storage properties of azobenzene&#8208;based MOST systems. We demonstrate with 3&#8208;unit peptoids bearing a single azobenzene chromophore that dynamics of the MOST systems can be tuned depending on the anchoring position of the photochromic unit on the macromolecular backbone. We measured a remarkable increase of the half&#8208;life of the metastable form up to 14&#8197;days at 20&#8201;&#176;C for a specific anchoring site, significantly higher than the isolated azobenzene moiety, thus opening new perspectives for MOST development. We also highlight that liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry does not only enable to monitor the different stereoisomers during the photoisomerization process as traditionally done, but also allows to determine the thermal back&#8208;isomerization kinetics.

     alt="Site Selectivity of Peptoids as Azobenzene Scaffold for Molecular Solar Thermal Energy Storage"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peptoids are introduced as programmable macromolecular scaffold to improve the solar energy storage properties of azobenzene. The anchoring position of the chromophore strongly affects the thermal back-isomerization kinetics with the longest half-life measured in this work (14&#8197;days) being larger than that of the isolated azobenzene unit (from 2 to 4&#8197;days).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storing solar energy is a key challenge in modern science. MOlecular Solar Thermal (MOST) systems, in particular those based on azobenzene switches, have received great interest in the last decades. The energy storage properties of azobenzene (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;

   &lt;i&gt;1/2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt;4&#8197;days; &#916;H~270&#8197;kJ/kg) must be improved for future applications. Herein, we introduce peptoids as programmable supramolecular scaffolds to improve the energy storage properties of azobenzene-based MOST systems. We demonstrate with 3-unit peptoids bearing a single azobenzene chromophore that dynamics of the MOST systems can be tuned depending on the anchoring position of the photochromic unit on the macromolecular backbone. We measured a remarkable increase of the half-life of the metastable form up to 14&#8197;days at 20&#8201;&#176;C for a specific anchoring site, significantly higher than the isolated azobenzene moiety, thus opening new perspectives for MOST development.

         <title>Conjugated Olefin Enabled Rollover Cyclometallation of Distant C&#8208;H Bonds: Regioselective Annulation of o&#8208;Alkenyl Phenols with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 70, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective rollover cyclometallation, assisted by conjugated olefin, is unveiled for the annulation of alkynes at two distant C&#8722;H bonds of o&#8208;alkenyl phenols. The annulation follows a concomitant cyclization rewarding a rare triple C&#8722;H functionalization. The reaction is also totally regioselective with an array of unsymmetrical alkynes, taking the leverage of an extended conjugation or a tertiary hydroxyl co&#8208;ordination.







Abstract
Although challenging, the distant C&#8722;H functionalization with precision is quite rewarding and has long been intriguing. Tailoring an appropriate template accomplishes the job but the prerequisite sets the limitation. We herein unveil our discovery of annulation of alkynes on to two distant (from directing group) C&#8722;H bonds through rollover cyclometallation assisted by conjugated C=C bond. The annulation follows a concomitant cyclization rewarding a rare triple C&#8722;H functionalization. The annulation is totally regioselective with an array of unsymmetrical alkynes, taking the leverage of an extended conjugation or a tertiary hydroxyl co&#8208;ordination. The mechanism is supported by control experiments, KIE &amp; labelling studies and Mass spectrometry.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Multifunctional Ni(OH)2&#8208;Supported Core&#8208;Shell Ni@Pd Nanocomposites for the Electro&#8208;Oxidation of Small Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 70, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ni(OH)2 formed by the spontaneous hydrolyzation of metallic Ni can prevent the aggregation of active core&#8208;shell Ni@Pd nanoparticles. At the same time, the Ni(OH)2 substrate is naturally active in the dissociation of H2O to generate OHads species. Consequently, the as&#8208;prepared Ni(OH)2/Ni@Pd nanocomposites is promising for the electrocatalytic oxidation of alcohols.







Abstract
In the domain of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), the development of efficient and durable catalysts for the electro&#8208;oxidation of small organic molecules, especially of alcohols (methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, et&#8197;al.) has always been a hot topic. A large number of related electrocatalysts with splendid performance have been designed and synthesized till now, while the preparation processes of most of them are demanding on experimental operations and conditions. Herein, we put forward a facile and handy method for the preparation of multifunctional Ni(OH)2&#8208;supported core&#8208;shell Ni@Pd nanocomposites (Ni(OH)2/Ni@Pd NCs) with the assistance of galvanic replacement reaction (GRR) at room temperature and ambient pressure. As expected, the Ni(OH)2 substrate can prevent the aggregation of core&#8208;shell (CS) Ni@Pd nanoparticles (NPs) and inhibit the formation of COads and further prevent Pd from being poisoned. The synergistic effect between CS Ni@Pd NPs and Ni(OH)2 substrate and the electronic effect between Pd shell and Ni core contribute to the outstanding electrocatalytic performance for methanol, ethanol, and ethylene glycol oxidation in alkaline condition. This study provides a succinct method for the design and preparation of efficient Pd&#8208;based electrocatalysts for alcohol electro&#8208;oxidation.

Microbial Na+&#8208;pumping rhodopsin (NaR) is a promising optogenetic tool due to its unique ability to transport Na+. We have developed a novel chemical modulation mode for NaR that goes beyond light control by introducing a potential Cl&#8722; binding site (Gln160). The increase in [Cl&#8722;] accelerates the uptake of Na+ and enhances Na+ transport activity. This Cl&#8722;&#8208;modulated NaR shows promise for potential applications in optogenetic therapies for related neurological diseases. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Chen and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302543).

A novel buckybowl catcher with an extended &#960;&#8208;surface has been synthesized by cross&#8208;coupling two bowl&#8208;shaped bromoindacenopicene moieties with a tolyl linker. The resulting binding values show a higher affinity of the catcher towards C70 over C60. The designed catcher demonstrated the fundamental possibility of creating sensors for spherical aromaticity. The catcher carefully framing the C70 fullerene is visualized as a miraculous, marvelous Faberg&#233; artwork. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;S. Oshchepkov, K.&#8197;Y. Amsharov, M.&#8197;E. P&#233;rez&#8208;Ojeda et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302778).

         <title>Synthetic Strategies of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefin (NHOs) and Their Recent Application of Organocatalytic Reactions and Beyond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 70, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHO) properties, synthetic methods, and applications are the main topics of this review work. In contrast to the NHC catalyst, NHOs, a recently identified class of electron&#8208;rich, polar alkene, exhibit important characteristics including strong basicity, high nucleophilicity, and high donating tendency. In addition, we comprehend their chemical reactivity and selectivity, and summarised the majority of organic synthesis processes, such as asymmetric catalysis, hydroborylation, hydrosilylation, reduction, CO2 sequestration, polymerisation, alkylation, etc.







Abstract
N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO) derivatives have an electron&#8208;rich as well as highly polarized carabon&#8208;carbon (C=C) double bond because of the electron&#8208;donating nature of nitrogen and sulphur atoms. While NHOs have been developing as novel organocatalysts and ligands for transition&#8208;metal complexes in various organic compound syntheses, different research groups are currently interested in preparing imidazole and triazolium&#8208;based chiral NHO catalysts. Some of them have been used for enantioselective organic transformations, but were still elusive. N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins, the alkylidene derivatives of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHC), have shown promising results as effective promoters for numerous organic syntheses such as asymmetric catalysis, hydroborylation, hydrosilylation, reduction, CO2 sequestration, alkylation, cycloaddition, polymerization and the ring&#8208;opening reaction of aziridine and epoxides, esterification, C&#8722;F bond functionalization, amine coupling, trifluoromethyl thiolation, amination etc. NHOs catalysts with suitable structures can serve as a novel class of Lewis/Bronsted bases with strong basicity and high nucleophilicity properties.These facts strongly suggest their enormous chemical potential as sustainable catalysts for a wide variety of reactions in synthetic chemistry. The synthesis of NHOs and their properties are briefly reviewed in this article, along with a summary of the imidazole and triazole core of NHOs&#8242; most recent catalytic uses.

         <title>Incorporating Photoresponses into Porous Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous liquids combine the properties of a porous solid with those of a liquid, creating a porous flowable media. Since their discovery, these materials have gathered widespread interest within the scientific community, with substantial numbers of new systems being discovered, often with a focus on increasing the pore volume and gas capacity. Which begs the question, what does the future hold for porous liquids? Recently, the first examples of photoresponsive porous liquids have emerged, allowing changes in porosity to be observed under UV irradiation. Here, we expand on our previous report of photoresponsive porous liquids and explore the conceptualisation of responsive porous liquids and how these materials could be developed with the ability to respond to light, thereby offering a potential mechanism of controllable uptake and release in these systems. This concept article summarises different approaches that could be used to incorporate a photoresponse in a porous liquid before discussing recently reported systems, alongside important factors to consider in their design. Finally, by taking inspiration from the methods used to translate porous solids into the liquid state, combined with the field of photoresponsive materials, we discuss potential strategies that could be employed to realise further examples of photoresponsive porous liquids.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerated Synthesis of Nanolayered MWW Zeolite by Interzeolite Transformation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining interzeolite transformation with a dual&#8208;template strategy, nanolayered MWW zeolite was obtained within 48&#8197;h. 4&#8208;Membered&#8208;ring (4MR) units from the FAU precursor are essential to accelerate MWW formation.







Abstract
Hierarchical zeolites can offer substantial benefits over bulk zeolites in catalysis. A drawback towards practical implementation is their lengthy synthesis, often requiring complex organic templates. This work describes an accelerated synthesis of nanolayered MWW zeolite based on the combination of interzeolite transformation (IZT) with a dual&#8208;templating strategy. FAU zeolite, hexamethyleneimine (HMI), and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were respectively employed as Al source and primary zeolite, structure directing agent, and exfoliating agent. This approach allowed to reduce the synthesis of nanolayered MWW to 48&#8197;h, which is a considerable advance over the state of the art.

     alt="Accelerated Synthesis of Nanolayered MWW Zeolite by Interzeolite Transformation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By combining interzeolite transformation with a dual-template strategy, nanolayered MWW zeolite was obtained within 48&#8197;h. 4-Membered-ring (4MR) units from the FAU precursor are essential to accelerate MWW formation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hierarchical zeolites can offer substantial benefits over bulk zeolites in catalysis. A drawback towards practical implementation is their lengthy synthesis, often requiring complex organic templates. This work describes an accelerated synthesis of nanolayered MWW zeolite based on the combination of interzeolite transformation (IZT) with a dual-templating strategy. FAU zeolite, hexamethyleneimine (HMI), and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were respectively employed as Al source and primary zeolite, structure directing agent, and exfoliating agent. This approach allowed to reduce the synthesis of nanolayered MWW to 48&#8197;h, which is a considerable advance over the state of the art. Tracking structural, textural, morphological, and chemical properties during crystallization showed that 4-membered-ring (4MR) units derived from the FAU precursor are involved in the faster formation of MWW in comparison to a synthesis procedure from amorphous precursor. CTAB restricts the growth of the zeolite in the c-direction, resulting in nanolayered MWW. Moreover, we show that this approach can speed up the synthesis of nanolayered FER. The merits of nanolayered MWW zeolites are demonstrated in terms of improved catalytic performance in the Diels-Alder cycloaddition of 2,5-dimethylfuran and ethylene to p-xylene compared to bulk reference MWW sample.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulating Excited States by Varying Different Acceptors of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A Emitters for Efficient Non&#8208;Doped Blue Electroluminescence with High Luminance and Low Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>

         <dc:description>
Three D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A emitters with different acceptors are designed and synthesized, and the excited states could be manipulated from LE&#8208;dominated (mPAN, and mPANPH) to HLCT featured (mPNAPH) transition. The non&#8208;doped OLED based on mPNAPH exhibits pure blue emission at 456&#8197;nm with high Lmax of 35290&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, EQEmax of 6.13&#8201;% and low efficiency roll&#8208;off.







Abstract
Chromophores with hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) excited state are promising for the realization of high performance blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The rational manipulation of HLCT excited state for efficient emitters remains challenging. Herein, we present three donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) molecules (mPAN, mPANPH, and mPNAPH) with phenanthro[9,10&#8208;d]imidazole (PI) and pyridinyl as donor and &#960;&#8208;bridge respectively. Changes in various kinds of polycyclic aromatic derivative acceptors (anthracene, 9&#8208;phenylanthracene, and 1&#8208;phenylnaphthalene) could manipulate the excited states and optoelectronic properties. Theoretical calculations reveal that the S1 state of mPNAPH exhibits HLCT nature while the other two molecules show local excited (LE) state dominated feature. The photophysical properties also demonstrate this characteristic. Therefore, compared with mPAN and mPANPH, mPNAPH has higher photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) whether in solutions or neat films. Ultimately, the non&#8208;doped devices based on these emitters show high luminance larger than 35000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, and high maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEmaxs) larger than 5&#8201;% with low efficiency roll&#8208;off. In particular, the mPNAPH&#8208;based device displays an excellent performance of pure blue emission at 456&#8197;nm with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage coordinate of (0.15, 0.16) and EQEmax of 6.13&#8201;% that benefited from the HLCT state and high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing process.

         <title>A Cyclotriveratrylene Solvent&#8208;Dependent Chiral Switch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In and out! The control of the cyclotriveratrylene chirality by achiral solvents allow to switch from an open cage in polar aprotic solvents to an imploded one in bulky aromatic solvents. Interestingly, this controlled molecular motion of a cyclotriveratrylene unit is described for the first time.







Abstract
Chiral molecular switches are attracting attention as they could pave the way to chiral molecular machines. Herein, we report on the design and synthesis of a single molecule chiral switch based on a cyclotriveratrylene scaffold, in which the chirality inversion is controlled by the solvent. Hemicryptophanes are built around a C3 cyclotriveratrylene chiral unit, with either M or P handedness, connected to another tripod and usually displaying an &#8220;out&#8221; configuration. Here, we demonstrate that solvents are able to control the &#8220;in&#8221; and &#8220;out&#8221; configurations of the CTV unit, creating a chiral molecular switch from (M/P)&#8221;in&#8221; to (P/M)&#8221;out&#8221; handedness. The full characterization of the &#8220;in&#8221; and &#8220;out&#8221; configurations and of the chirality switch were made possible by combining NMR, HPLC, ECD, DFT and molecular dynamics. Interestingly, bulky aromatic solvents such as 2&#8208;t&#8208;butylphenol favor the &#8220;in&#8221; configuration while polar aprotic solvents such as acetone favor the &#8220;out&#8221; configuration. This chiral switch was found to be fully reversible allowing the system to oscillate between two different M and P configurations several times upon the action of solvents stimuli.

         <title>A Conformationally Stable &#960;&#8208;Expanded X&#8208;Type Double Helicene Comprising Dihydropyracylene Units with Multistage Redox Behavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented X&#8208;type double helicene with &#960;&#8208;expanded polycyclic framework and exceptional conformational stability was realized and its enantiomers were successfully separated. Comprehensive spectroscopic and electrochemical studies in conjunction with theory identified the compound as a strong chiral fluorophore with 5&#8208;stage amphoteric redox behavior.







Abstract
A &#960;&#8208;expanded X&#8208;type double [5]helicene comprising dihydropyracylene moieties was synthesized from commercially available acenaphthene. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis revealed the unique highly twisted structure of the compound resulting in the occurrence of two enantiomers which were separated by chiral HPLC, owing to their high conformational stability. The compound shows strongly bathochromically shifted UV/vis absorption and emission bands with small Stokes shift and considerable photoluminescence quantum yield and circular polarized luminescence response. The electrochemical studies revealed five facilitated reversible redox events, including three reductions and two oxidations, thus qualifying the compound as chiral multistage redox amphoter. The experimental findings are in line with the computational studies based on density functional theory pointing towards increased spatial extension of the frontier molecular orbitals over the polycyclic framework and a considerably narrowed HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap.

         <title>Capturing Sialyl&#8208;glycan on Live Cancer Cells by Tailored Boronopeptide
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This investigation demonstrates that the appropriate positioning of a customized boronic acid probe into a sialic acid binding epitope leverages a selective and potent binder of sialyl&#8208;glycan. Such synergistic peptide probe is promising in clinical oncology for diagnosis.







Abstract
Boronic acid&#8208;containing molecules are substantially popularized in chemical biology and medicinal chemistry due to the broad spectrum of covalent conjugations as well as interaction modules offered by the versatile boron atom. Apparently, the WGA peptide (wheat germ agglutinin, 62&#8211;73), which shows a considerably low binding affinity to sialic acid, turned into a selective and &gt;5 folds potent binder with the aid of a suitable boronic acid probe installed chemoselectively. In silico studies prompted us to install BA probes on the cysteine residue, supposedly located in close proximity to the bound sialic acid. In vitro studies revealed that the tailored boronopeptides show enhanced binding ability due to the synergistic recognition governed by selective non&#8208;covalent interactions and cis&#8208;diol boronic acid conjugation. The intense binding is observed even in 10&#8201;% serum, thus enabling profiling of sialyl&#8208;glycan on cancer cells, as compared with the widely used lectin, Sambucus nigra. The synergistic binding mode between the best boronopeptide (P3) binder and sialic acid was analyzed via 1H and 11B&#8197;NMR.

         <title>Investigation of Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)&#8208;Plasma Membrane Interaction in Live Cells and the Influence of GPI Glycan Structure on the Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional GPI derivative containing the entire conserved core structure of GPIs was proved to be a useful probe to target the cell membrane and tag GPI&#8208;related membrane proteins to facilitate protein isolation and proteomics analysis.







Abstract
Glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) need to interact with other components in the cell membrane to transduce transmembrane signals. A bifunctional GPI probe was employed for photoaffinity&#8208;based proximity labelling and identification of GPI&#8208;interacting proteins in the cell membrane. This probe contained the entire core structure of GPIs and was functionalized with photoreactive diazirine and clickable alkyne to facilitate its crosslinking with proteins and attachment of an affinity tag. It was disclosed that this probe was more selective than our previously reported probe containing only a part structure of the GPI core for cell membrane incorporation and an improved probe for studying GPI&#8208;cell membrane interaction. Eighty&#8208;eight unique membrane proteins, many of which are related to GPIs/GPI&#8208;anchored proteins, were identified utilizing this probe. The proteomics dataset is a valuable resource for further analyses and data mining to find new GPI&#8208;related proteins and signalling pathways. A comparison of these results with those of our previous probe provided direct evidence for the profound impact of GPI glycan structure on its interaction with the cell membrane.

         <title>Exploring the Influence of the Phosphorus&#8208;Heteroatom Substitution in Nicotine on Its Electronic and Vibrational Spectroscopic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impacts of the phosphorus&#8208;substituted heteroatom in heterocycles on the vibrational spectroscopy and structural properties of a molecule were investigated. It was observed that phosphorus substitution in the conformationally flexible ring in addition to changing the structural and conformational properties of a molecule was able to alter the VCD patterns of these molecules.







Abstract
The influence of phosphorus substitution of nitrogen in heterocyclic compounds on the vibrational spectroscopy as well as frontier molecular orbitals are analyzed. Nicotine with two nitrogen atoms in its structure is taken as the sample system to be studied computationally. By replacing the nitrogen atom in one or both rings of this molecule with phosphorus, three nicotine derivatives are created. The vibrational circular dichroism and infrared spectra of these four molecules in their monomer state, as well as the assemblies up to trimers are determined. The aforementioned spectra are calculated using static quantum chemical calculations employing a cluster&#8208;weighted approach. The calculated gas phase spectra of nicotine are compared to their respective experimental spectra. It is observed that the nicotine derivatives with phosphorus in the methylpyrrolidine ring have considerably different gas phase and bulk phase vibrational circular dichroism spectra when compared to nicotine. The phosphorus substitution reduces the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital as well as altering the polarizability and reactivity of the investigated molecules.

         <title>Unravelling CO2 Reduction Reaction Intermediates on High Entropy Alloy Catalysts: An Interpretable Machine Learning Approach To Establish Scaling Relations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a proposed interpretable machine learning model successfully established a scaling relation among the adsorbates adsorbed on the same adsorption sites of the complex high entropy alloy catalytic surfaces through suitable features and techniques.







Abstract
Establishment of a scaling relation among the reaction intermediates is highly important but very much challenging on complex surfaces, such as surfaces of high entropy alloys (HEAs). Herein, we designed an interpretable machine learning (ML) approach to establish a scaling relation among CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) intermediates adsorbed at the same adsorption site. Local Interpretable Model&#8208;Agnostic Explanations (LIME), Accumulated Local Effects (ALE), and Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) are used for the global and local interpretation of the utilized black box models. These methods were successfully applied through an iterative way and validated on CuCoNiZnMg and CuCoNiZnSnbased HEAs data. Finally, we successfully predicted adsorption energies of *H2CO (MAE: 0.24&#8197;eV) and *H3CO (MAE: 0.23&#8197;eV) by using the *HCO training data. Similarly, adsorption energy of *O (MAE: 0.32&#8197;eV) is also predicted from *H training data. We believe that our proposed method can shift the paradigm of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ML in catalysis towards better interpretability.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H (Phenylsulfonyl)difluoromethylation of Acrylamides: Scope, Mechanism, and Critical Role of Additives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report first CuII&#8208;catalyzed Z&#8208;selective difluoromethylation of vinylic&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H bond of acrylamides bearing a native functional group with an in&#8208;home designed and stable electrophilic salt. The versatility of the CF2SO2Ph group was shown and mechanistic studies supported by DFT calculations highlight the critical role of additives. The process was achieved under robust reaction conditions in the presence of the readily available Cu(OAc)2.







Abstract
Herein, we report the Cu&#8208;complex catalyzed, native functional group&#8208;assisted, and TFA/NMF additives promoted (phenylsulfonyl)difluoromethylation of vinylic C(sp2)&#8722;H bond of acrylamides. Using our in&#8208;home designed reagent, this reaction enables the construction of the C(sp2)&#8722;CF2SO2Ph bond from simple C&#8722;H bond activation by copper catalysis under mild reaction conditions with total Z&#8208;selectivity. The versatility of utilized fluorinated group was illustrated by its conversion into value&#8208;added CF2 moieties as well as the remarkable =CHF residue. The performed experimental and computational mechanistic studies enabled to identify the true nature of active catalyst and substrate, as well as establish critical roles of TFA and NMF additives. In this reaction, the TFA acts as a promoter of the much&#8208;needed CuII/CuII&#8594;CuIII/CuI disproportionation, while the NMF facilitates the following ligand exchange and C&#8722;C coupling processes. We ruled out the generation of radical intermediates and established the C&#8722;H activation to be irreversible and the rate&#8208;determining step of the entire process.

         <title>Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction Using Palladium Catalysts Supported on Phosphine Periodic Mesoporous Organosilica</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd(0) immobilized a phosphine periodic mesoporous organosilica (P&#8208;PMO) catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross coupling reactions of various aryl chlorides with phenylboronic acid. The annular dark field scanning TEM (ADF&#8208;STEM) images as well as EDX analysis evidenced that a single Pd atom supported on the P&#8208;PMO surface behaves as a reactive site.







Abstract
Phosphine periodic mesoporous organosilicas (R&#8208;P&#8208;PMO&#8208;TMS: R=Ph, tBu), which possess electron&#8208;donating alkyl substituents on the phosphorus atom, were synthesized using bifunctional compounds with alkoxysilyl&#8208; and phosphino groups, bis[3&#8208;(triethoxysilyl)propyl]phenylphosphine borane (1&#8201;a) and bis[3&#8208;(triethoxysilyl)propyl]&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphine borane (1&#8201;b). Immobilization of Pd(0) species was performed to give R&#8208;P&#8208;Pd&#8208;PMO&#8208;TMS: R=Ph (2&#8201;a), tBu (3&#8201;a), respectively. The Pd(0) immobilized 2&#8201;a and 3&#8201;a were applicable as catalysts for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions of aryl chlorides with phenylboronic acid. It was revealed that 3&#8201;a bearing more electron&#8208;donating tBu groups exhibited higher catalytic activity. Various functional groups including both electron withdrawing and donating substituents were compatible in the system. The recyclability of 3&#8201;a was examined to support its moderate utility for the recycle use.

Immobilization of Pd(0) species was performed to give R-P-Pd-PMO-TMS: R=Ph (&lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;), &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu (&lt;b&gt;3&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;), respectively. The Pd(0) immobilized &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; were applicable as catalysts for Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions of aryl chlorides with phenylboronic acid. It was revealed that &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; bearing more electron-donating &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu groups exhibited higher catalytic activity. Various functional groups including both electron withdrawing and donating substituents were compatible in the system. The recyclability of &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; was examined to support its moderate utility for the recycle use.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Efficient development of multifunctional photoactuators with enhanced mechanical/photomechanical properties, UV&#8208;NIR dual light&#8208;responsivity, room&#8208;temperature three&#8208;dimensional (3D) shape reprogrammability and reprocessability, and photothermal healability by simply doping polydopamine (PDA) nanoparticles into main&#8208;chain azo semi&#8208;crystalline poly(ester&#8208;amide) (PEA) films is described. They are compatible with aqueous environment and exhibit photothermal deformation below the melting temperature based on a unique photothermally induced hydrogen bond&#8208;disruption mechanism.







Abstract
The development of soft photoactuators with multifunctionality and improved performance is highly important for their broad applications. Herein, we report on a facile and efficient strategy for fabricating such photoactuators with UV&#8208;NIR dual light&#8208;responsivity, room&#8208;temperature 3D shape reprogrammability and reprocessability, and photothermal healability by doping polydopamine (PDA) nanoparticles into a main&#8208;chain azobenzene semi&#8208;crystalline poly(ester&#8208;amide) (PEA). The PEA/PDA nanoparticle composite was readily processed into free&#8208;standing films with enhanced mechanical and photomechanical properties compared with the blank PEA films. Its physically crosslinked uniaxially oriented films showed rapid and highly reversible photochemically induced bending/unbending under the UV/visible light irradiation at room temperature in both the air atmosphere and water. When exposed to the NIR light, they (and their bilayer films formed with a polyimide film) exhibited photothermally induced bending even at a temperature much lower than their crystalline&#8208;to&#8208;isotropic phase transition temperature based on a unique mechanism (involving photothermally induced polymer chain relaxation due to the disruption of their hydrogen bonds). The room&#8208;temperature 3D shape reprogrammability and reprocessability and photothermal healability of the composite polymer films were also demonstrated. Such multifunctional dual light&#8208;responsive photoactuators with well&#8208;balanced mechanical robustness, actuation stability, 3D shape reprogrammability/reprocessability and photothermal healability hold much promise in various photoactuating applications.

         <title>Discovery of Unusual Ajmaline&#8208;Macroline Type Bisindole Alkaloids from Alstonia macrophylla by Building Blocks&#8208;Based Molecular Networking</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three unusual ajmaline&#8208;macroline type bisindole alkaloids, alsmaphylines A&#8211;C (1&#8211;3), were rapidly discovered and isolated from the stem barks and leaves of Alstonia macrophylla via a building blocks&#8208;based molecular network (BBMN) strategy.







Abstract
Three unusual ajmaline&#8208;macroline type bisindole alkaloids, alsmaphylines A&#8211;C, together with their postulated biogenetic precursors, were isolated from the stem barks and leaves of Alstonia macrophylla via the building blocks&#8208;based molecular network (BBMN) strategy. Alsmaphyline A represents a rare ajmaline&#8208;macroline type bisindole alkaloid with an S&#8208;shape polycyclic ring system. Alsmaphylines B and C are two novel ajmaline&#8208;macroline type bisindole alkaloids with N&#8208;1&#8722;C&#8208;21&#8242; linkages, and the former possesses an unconventional stacked conformation due to the presence of intramolecular noncovalent interactions. The chemical structures including absolute configurations of alsmaphylines A&#8211;C were established by comprehensive spectroscopic analyses, electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. In addition, a plausible biosynthetic pathway of these bisindole alkaloids as well as their ability to promote the protein synthesis on HT22 cells were discussed.

         <title>Facile Access to Cationic Methylstannylenes and Silylenes Stabilized by E&#8722;Pt Bonding and their Methyl Group Transfer Reactivity
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt/Sn and Pt/Si heterobimetallic complexes were developed, cationic methyl stannylene was prepared by complete Me group transfer from Pt(II) to Sn under mild conditions, low valent silicon was stabilized with neutral nitrogen donor. Transmetalation from a monomethyl Pt center was triggered by hydride sources.







Abstract
We describe a family of cationic methylstannylene and chloro&#8208; and azidosilylene organoplatinum(II) complexes supported by a neutral, binucleating ligand. Methylstannylenes MeSn:+ are stabilized by coordination to PtII and are formed by facile Me group transfer from dimethyl or monomethyl PtII complexes, in the latter case triggered by concomitant B&#8722;H, Si&#8722;H, and H2 bond activation that involves hydride transfer from Sn to Pt. A cationic chlorosilylene complex was obtained by formal HCl elimination and Cl&#8722; removal from HSiCl3 under ambient conditions. The computational studies show that stabilization of cationic methylstannylenes and cationic silylenes is achieved through weak coordination to a neutral N&#8208;donor ligand binding pocket. The analysis of the electronic potentials, as well as the Laplacian of electron density, also reveals the differences in the character of Pt&#8722;Si vs. Pt&#8722;Sn bonding. We demonstrate the importance of a ligand&#8208;supported binuclear Pt/tetrel core and weak coordination to facilitate access to tetrylium&#8208;ylidene Pt complexes, and a transmetalation approach to the synthesis of MeSnII:+ derivatives.

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of Diterpenoids from iso&#8208;GGPP&#8197;III: A Geranylgeranyl Diphosphate Analog with a Shifted Double Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) analog iso&#8208;GGPP&#8197;III with a shifted double bond was synthesized and enzymatically converted with six diterpene synthases. The main products were isolated from the often complex product mixtures and structurally characterized, revealing, in several cases, the formation of compounds with novel skeletons that can be explained by the changed reactivity of the substrate analog.







Abstract
The analog of the diterpene precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate with a double bond shifted from C14=C15 to C15=C16 (named iso&#8208;GGPP&#8197;III) has been synthesized and enzymatically converted with six bacterial diterpene synthases; this allowed the isolation of nine unnatural diterpenes. For some of the enzyme&#8208;substrate combinations, the different reactivity implemented in the substrate analog iso&#8208;GGPP&#8197;III opened reaction pathways that are not observed with natural GGPP, resulting in the formation of diterpenes with novel skeletons. A stereoselective deuteration strategy was used to assign the absolute configurations of the isolated diterpenes.

To improve the slow OER kinetics, we synthesize nanoflower&#8208;like Co&#8208;Fe&#8208;Cr&#8208;Mo&#8208;Mn high&#8208;entropy spinel (HES) nanosheets on nickel foam (NF) by one&#8208;step solvothermal method, which exhibit an overpotential (&#951;10) of only 188 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2, much lower than bimetallic CoFeOx/NF (233 mV), trimetallic CoFeCrOx/NF (211 mV), and tetrametallic CoFeCrMoOx/NF (200 mV). The OER overpotential decreases with the increase of the number of metals, indicating that the formation of HES has a positive effect on the improvement of electrocatalytic performance, since the synergistic effect between different metals enhances the charge transfer rate and decreases reaction barrier. In&#8208;situ Raman spectra demonstrate that the formation of &#947;&#8208;NiOOH on the HES surface is a crucial active species for the OER. This work demonstrates a simple and efficient synthesis method to prepare nanoflower&#8208;like high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts for efficient OER electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Hexakispyrazolylethane: A New Strategy for Stabilization of Hexaarylethane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hexakis(4&#8208;trimethylsilylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethane (1TMS) was synthesized by the oxidative dimerization of tris(4&#8208;trimethylsilylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methane (2TMS). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis of 1TMS showed that the ethane C&#8211;C bond (1.623(4) &#197;) is shorter than that in hexaphenylethane (1.67(3) &#197;). In solution, 1TMS existed as a single species, contrastive that conventional hexaphenylethanes can keep the central C&#8211;C bond only by the aid of additional bridges between the two triarylmethyl units. Theoretical calculations indicated that the tris(pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methyl radical (2H&#8226;), which is anticipated to be under equilibrium with hexakis(pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethane (1H), is less stable than trityl radicals due to lack of delocalization of the radicals. Furthermore, introduction of pyrazole groups allowed additional bridging between the two triarylmethyl moieties through metal coordination to the adjacent N atoms: 1TMS exhibited unique coordination to three Ag atoms affording a hexaarylethane analog bearing three N&#8211;Ag&#8211;N bridges.</dc:description>

         <title>Unexpected Low Temperature Activity with Low N2O Emission of Stabilized Al&#8208;rich Zeolite Beta for Selective Catalytic Reduction of NOx</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The low temperature activity of Fe&#8208;loaded zeolites as selective catalytic reduction of NOx by NH3 (NH3&#8208;SCR) catalysts is a critical drawback for practical application. Here, we found unexpected improvement of low temperature activity by our proposed postsynthetic treatment. An Al&#8208;rich zeolite beta (Si/Al = 5) is employed as the catalyst support, and the parent sample is dealuminated for higher hydrothermal stability, followed by the liquid&#8208;mediated stabilization treatment and impregnation. It is found that stabilized samples feature excellent low temperature activity and high N2 selectivity even for a long&#8208;term operation, along with the ability to maintain high NOx conversion after aging. The improved SCR activity should be attributed to abundant acid sites in Al&#8208;rich framework and better stabilization of monomeric iron species after the stabilization treatment. Furthermore, the low yield of side product N2O is probably due to the absence of the generation of NH4NO3 during NH3&#8208;SCR catalyzed by Fe&#8208;loaded zeolites.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Progress of the Cathode Material Design for Aqueous Zn&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have emerged as the most promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their inherent safety, environmental friendliness, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Simultaneously, the utilization of organic electrode materials with renewable resources, environmental compatibility, and diverse structures has sparked a surge in research and development of aqueous Zn&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs). A comprehensive review is warranted to systematically present recent advancements in design principles, synthesis techniques, energy storage mechanisms, and zinc&#8208;ion storage performance of organic cathodes. In this review article, we initially summarize the energy storage mechanisms employed by aqueous ZOBs. Subsequently, we categorize organic cathode materials into small&#8208;molecule compounds and high&#8208;molecular polymers respectively. Novel polymer materials such as conjugated polymers (CPs), conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs), and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are highlighted with an overview of molecular design strategies and structural optimization based on organic cathode materials aimed at enhancing the performance of aqueous ZOBs. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by aqueous ZOBs along with future prospects to offer insights into their practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Sn Bulk Phase Doping and Surface Modification on Ti4O7 for Oxygen Reduction to Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We doped Sn into Ti4O7 (D&#8208;Sn&#8208;Ti4O7) by simple polymerization post&#8208;calcination method as a high&#8208;efficiency 2e&#8208; ORR electrocatalyst. In addition, we also applied plain calcination after the grinding method to load Sn on Ti4O7 (L&#8208;Sn&#8208;Ti4O7) as a comparison. However, the performance of L&#8208;Sn&#8208;Ti4O7 is far inferior to that of the D&#8208;Sn&#8208;Ti4O7. D&#8208;Sn&#8208;Ti4O7 exhibits a starting potential of 0.769 V (versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) and a high H2O2 selectivity of 95.7%. Excitingly, the catalyst can maintain a stable current density of 2.43 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2 for 3600 s in our self&#8208;made H&#8208;type cell, and the cumulative H2O2 production reaches 359.2 mg&#183;L&#8208;1 within 50,000 s at 0.3 V. The performance of D&#8208;Sn&#8208;Ti4O7 is better than that of the non&#8208;noble metal 2e&#8208; ORR catalysts reported so far. The doping of Sn not only improves the conductivity but also leads to the lattice distortion of Ti4O7, further forming more oxygen vacancies and Ti3+, which greatly improves its 2e&#8208; ORR performance compared with the original Ti4O7. In contrast, since the Sn on the surface of L&#8208;Sn&#8208;Ti4O7 displays a synergistic effect with Tin+ (3 &#8804; n &#8804; 4) of Ti4O7, the active center Tin+ dissociates the O = O bond, making it more inclined to 4e&#8208; ORR.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nickel Anchored Covalent Organic Framework as Unimolecular Metallaphotocatalyst for Visible Light Driver C&#8722;P Bond Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The urgent need to develop a sustainable and environmentally friendly method for synthesizing organophosphine compounds is underscored by their extensive applications in organic synthesis, coordination chemistry, medicinal chemistry, and photoelectric materials. Metalated covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs), which seamlessly integrate the inherent photo properties of COF with the catalytic capabilities of metal ions, offer an optimal material for efficient transformation of organics sustainably. In this study, we introduce a simple COF with nickel anchorages (Bpy&#8208;COF&#8208;NiCl2) as a unimolecular metallaphotocatalytic system for effective C&#8208;P bond formation. This heterogeneous photocatalyst exhibits superior catalytic performance, achieving yields of up to 95%, and demonstrates broad substrate tolerance and functional group reactivity. Notably, the metallaphotocatalytic system has demonstrated the capability to process aryl bromides to produce the desired product, a feat not previously reported. Finally, the production and reusability test at the gram scale attests to its superior practicality for designing future organic cross&#8208;coupling reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8220;Bubble&#8208;Diode&#8221; Breathable Electrodes for Fast Gas Transport</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bubbles arising from wild gas evolution commonly exist in electrochemical systems, particularly in water electrolysis and rechargeable aqueous batteries (e.g., Zn&#8208;air batteries).

An electrocatalytic hypervalent iodine(III)&#8208;mediated in&#8208;cell synthesis of 3,4&#8208;dihydroquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones by C&#8722;N coupling is established, applying catalytic amounts of reagents, inexpensive electrode materials and a simple galvanostatic set&#8208;up. With this method 23 examples in yields up to 96&#8201;% could be synthesized, exhibiting various functional groups. Furthermore, a 10&#8208;fold scale&#8208;up was performed and a reaction mechanism was proposed.







Abstract
Electrochemically generated hypervalent iodine(III) species are powerful reagents for oxidative C&#8722;N coupling reactions, providing access to valuable N&#8208;heterocycles. A new electrocatalytic hypervalent iodine(III)&#8208;mediated in&#8208;cell synthesis of 1H&#8208;N&#8208;aryl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones by dehydrogenative C&#8722;N bond formation is presented. Catalytic amounts of the redox mediator, a low supporting electrolyte concentration and recycling of the solvent used make this method a sustainable alternative to electrochemical ex&#8208;cell or conventional approaches. Furthermore, inexpensive, readily available electrode materials and a simple galvanostatic set&#8208;up are applied. The broad functional group tolerance could be demonstrated by synthesizing 23 examples in yields up to 96&#8201;%, with one reaction being performed on a 10&#8208;fold higher scale. Based on the obtained results a sound reaction mechanism could be proposed.

         <title>Synthesis of Waixenicin A: Exploring Strategies for Nine&#8208;Membered Ring Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A full account on the development of the first total synthesis of the marine natural product waixenicin A is presented. Learning from a series of approaches which ultimately remained unsuccessful, a route relying on an intramolecular alkylation to forge the characteristic nine&#8208;membered ring of the natural product was developed.







Abstract
We present a comprehensive account on our efforts behind the recently published synthesis of waixenicin A. Our approach for constructing the dihydropyran ring relied on an Achmatowicz rearrangement. For the assembly of the nine&#8208;membered ring, four distinct strategies were investigated. Our initial attempts using radical&#8208;based addition/fragmentation reactions targeting the C7&#8722;C11 bond proved unsuitable for accessing the 6/9&#8208;bicycle. By employing anionic fragmentation conditions at the furfuryl alcohol stage, we successfully reached a 5/9&#8208;bicycle. However, subsequent ring&#8208;expansion was unsuccessful. Alternative approaches, such as Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi or Heck reactions to connect the C6&#8722;C7 bond, also encountered difficulties, with no nine&#8208;membered ring formation observed. Our first breakthrough came from our attempts to install the C5&#8722;C6 bond via an intramolecular alkylation. Surprisingly, subsequent functional group modifications proved unexpectedly challenging, necessitating a redesign of our synthetic route. Drawing from all our investigations, we concluded that construction of the C9&#8722;C10 bond would enable efficient nine&#8208;membered ring alkylation and would facilitate the installation of the desired substitution pattern along the southern periphery. Exploration of this strategy yielded further surprises but ultimately led to the successful synthesis of waixenicin A and 9&#8208;deacetoxy&#8208;14,15&#8208;deepoxyxeniculin. For the latter compound, a bioinspired one&#8208;step rearrangement to xeniafauranol A was achieved.

         <title>Enhancing Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation Upconversion of Pyrene Derivatives for Photoredox Catalysis via Molecular Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highest efficient red&#8208;to&#8208;green upconversion is achieved in a TTA&#8208;UC pair consisted of PdTPTBP and pyrene derivative via molecular engineering. This pair is successfully used to activate photooxidation of aryl boronic acid under red light, and the reaction yield is greatly improved compared to green light, showing the advantage of TTA&#8208;UC in photoredox catalysis.







Abstract
Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) has the potential to enhance photoredox catalysis yield. It includes a sensitizer and an annihilator. Efficient and stable annihilators are essential for photoredox catalysis, yet only a few examples are reported. Herein, we designed four novel pyrene annihilators (1, 2, 3 and 4) via introducing aryl&#8208;alkynyl groups onto pyrene to systematically modulate their singlet and triplet energies. Coupled with platinum octaethylporphyrin (PtOEP), the TTA&#8208;UC efficiency is enhanced gradually as the number of aryl&#8208;alkynyl group increases. When combining 4 with palladium tetraphenyl&#8208;tetrabenzoporphyrin (PdTPTBP), we achieved the highest red&#8208;to&#8208;green upconversion efficiency (22.4&#177;0.3&#8201;%) (out of a 50&#8201;% maximum) so far. Then, this pair was used to activate photooxidation of aryl boronic acid under red light (630&#8197;nm), which achieved a great improved reaction yield compared to that activated by green light directly. The results not only provide a design strategy for efficient annihilators, but also show the advantage of applying TTA&#8208;UC into improving the photoredox catalysis yield.

Herein, we designed four novel pyrene annihilators (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) via introducing aryl-alkynyl groups onto pyrene to systematically modulate their singlet and triplet energies. Coupled with platinum octaethylporphyrin (PtOEP), the TTA-UC efficiency is enhanced gradually as the number of aryl-alkynyl group increases. When combining &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; with palladium tetraphenyl-tetrabenzoporphyrin (PdTPTBP), we achieved the highest red-to-green upconversion efficiency (22.4&#177;0.3&#8201;%) (out of a 50&#8201;% maximum) so far. Then, this pair was used to activate photooxidation of aryl boronic acid under red light (630&#8197;nm), which achieved a great improved reaction yield compared to that activated by green light directly. The results not only provide a design strategy for efficient annihilators, but also show the advantage of applying TTA-UC into improving the photoredox catalysis yield.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Metal&#8208;free and Operationally Simple Radical Trifluoromethylative Borylation of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and efficient protocol has been developed to generate a trifluoromethyl and boron centered radical under metal&#8208;free conditions by the synergetic interaction of highly Lewis acidic boron reagent with Togni reagent. This method establishes a new approach for the installation of trifluoromethyl and boron moiety to the unactivated alkenes simultaneously.







Abstract
We herein describe a protocol to synthesize trifluoromethylated alkyl boronates from alkenes by the mutual activation of the Togni II and the bis(catecholato)diboron reagents in the absence of any catalyst and additives. This reaction enables synthesizing a series of trifluoromethylated alkyl boronates using unactivated alkenes, including natural products and drug derivatives, in a regioselective manner. Moreover, the synthetic utility of the boronic ester present in the product allows access to a range of trifluoromethyl containing compounds. The radical trapping and gas detection experiments reveal that the more Lewis acidic diboron reagent determines the rapid formation of trifluoromethyl and boron centered radicals.

         <title>Molecular Accessibility and Diffusion of Resorufin in Zeolite Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Color&#8208;changing dyes in zeolites: In free solution, deprotonated resorufin emits a bright fuchsia&#8208;colored light. As it proceeds through the pore openings of zeolite&#8208;&#946;, it picks up a proton. Confinement by the micropores allows this species to fluoresce with a bright orange light. This feature was used to investigate accessibility and diffusion (barriers) in zeolites. More information can be found in the Research Article by B.&#8197;M. Weckhuysen and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302553).

         <title>Calamitic Liquid Crystals for Reversible Light&#8208;Modulated Phase Regulation Based on Arylazopyrazole Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A birefringent thin film of liquid crystals based on photoswitchable arylazopyrazoles has been created. The typical schlieren structure is indicative of calamitic liquid crystals. Upon irradiation with UV light, the mesogen photoisomerizes from E to Z, and the liquid crystal instantaneously forms an isotropic liquid. Upon irradiation with green light, the mesogen photoisomerizes from Z to E, and the liquid crystal reassembles. The phase transition can be induced locally using an optical fiber. More information can be found in the Research Article by B.&#8197;J. Ravoo and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302958).

         <title>Contemporary Applications of Thioamides and Methods for their Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thioamides are naturally occurring isosteres of amide bonds in which the chalcogen atom of the carbonyl is changed from oxygen to sulfur. This substitution gives rise to altered nucleophilicity and hydrogen bonding properties with importance for both chemical reactivity and non&#8208;covalent interactions. As such, thioamides have been introduced into biologically active compounds to achieve improved target affinity and/or stability towards hydrolytic enzymes but have also been applied as probes of protein and peptide folding and dynamics. Recently, a series of new methods have been developed for the synthesis of thioamides as well as their utilization in peptide chemistry. Further, novel strategies for the incorporation of thioamides into proteins have been developed, enabling both structural and functional studies to be performed. In this Review, we highlight the recent developments in the preparation of thioamides and their applications for peptide modification and study of protein function.</dc:description>

         <title>Study on the epoxidation of chain olefins using biquaternary ammonium phosphotungstic acid phase transfer catalysts under no&#8208;solvent condition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we have developed a novel catalyst synthesized by phosphotungstic acid and a gemini quaternary ammonium cation salt. This quaternary ammonium salt not only reduces the interfacial tension between olefins and hydrogen peroxide but also forms a notably stable structure with phosphotungstic acid. Dodecene was successfully epoxidized to epoxy dodecane with a selectivity of 82.9%. The impact of initial conditions were systematically investigated such as molar ratio, temperature, reaction time, and catalyst dosage on the catalytic performance. Characterization of the catalyst morphology was performed by SEM, TEM and SAXS. Raman spectra, FT&#8208;IR and XPS spectra were employed to perform the catalyst transformation during the epoxidation reaction. This catalytic mechanism study could provide the industrial application in the epoxidation of long&#8208;chain olefins.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformer aggregates exhibit dual wavelength emissions on chiral binaphthyl&#8208;based triphenylethylenes and acetone detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study on structure&#8208;property relationship has been a significant focus in the field of organic molecular luminescence. In the present work, three chiral binaphthyl&#8208;based triphenylethylene (HTPE) derivatives were prepared through condensation reactions. Despite their similar structures, these compounds exhibited distinct luminescent properties. Diphenylmethane&#8208;derived HTPE displayed dual&#8208;state emissions, characterized by dual&#8208;wavelength emissions which were insensitive to the polarity of solvents. The dual emissions in solution state could be attributed to the different locally excited (LE) excitons. However, upon aggregation, two stable conformers were generated, probably leading to different emission peaks. In contrast, dibenzocycloheptadiene&#8208;derived HTPE aggregates showed only a single emission peak. Surprisingly, fluorene&#8208;derived HTPE exhibited obvious luminescence in neither solution nor aggregate states due to inherent &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. These conclusions were substantiated by X&#8208;ray analysis, spectroscopic analysis, and theory calculations. Application studies demonstrated that fluorescence on/off switches could be achieved through exposure to acetone. More importantly, trace amounts of acetone could be detected using luminescent materials in both organic and aqueous phases with a detection limit of 0.08%. Thus, this work not only presents a strategy for designing chiral triphenylethylene fluorophores but also provides valuable information for dual wavelength emissions resulting from two stable conformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Autocatalysis in Eschenmoser Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Eschenmoser coupling reaction (ECR) of thioamides with electrophiles is believed to proceed via thiirane intermediates. However, little is known about converting the intermediates into ECR products. Previous mechanistic studies involved external thiophiles to remove the sulfur atom from the intermediates. In this work, an ECR proceeding without any thiophilic agent or base is studied by electrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometry. ESI&#8208;MS enables the detection of the so&#8208;far elusive polysulfide species Sn, with n ranging from 2 to 16 sulfur atoms, proposed to be the key species leading to product formation. Integrating observations from ion mobility spectrometry, ion spectroscopy, and reaction monitoring via flow chemistry coupled with mass spectrometry provides a comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanism and uncovers the autocatalytic nature of the ECR reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Neutral Chromium Complex with a Cr&#8801;Si Triple Bond: Synthesis and Photoinduced H&#8211;H and Benzene C&#8211;H Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A neutral silylyne complex with a Cr&#8801;Si triple bond was prepared by dehydrogenation of a chromium silylene complex with Cr&#8211;H and Si&#8211;H bonds, and was isolated as monomeric crystals, unlike dimeric forms of its tungsten and molybdenum congeners. The strong Cr(&#948;&#8208;)&#8211;Si(&#948; +) bond polarity was revealed by the reaction with MeOH and DFT calculations. The chromium silylyne complex reacted with H2 under LED (365 nm) irradiation to reproduce the precursor silylene complex with a (H)Cr=Si(H) moiety, as a result of 1,2&#8208;H&#8211;H addition across the Cr&#8801;Si triple bond. Similarly, the chromium silylyne complex reacted with benzene under irradiation to afford an 1,2&#8208;addition product with a (H)Cr=Si(Ph) moiety, via benzene C&#8211;H bond activation accompanied by Si&#8211;C bond forming.</dc:description>

         <title>Anode Reaction Control for a Single&#8208;Compartment Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reactor with a Surface&#8208;Activated Diamond Cathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical reaction of carbon dioxide (CO2) in aqueous electrolyte solutions is attracting increasing attention for sustainable chemical production. Boron&#8208;doped diamond (BDD) electrodes have been previously shown to be very effective for the stable electrochemical production of formic acid from CO2. Typically, the electrochemical production of formic acid by CO2 reduction (CO2R) reaction is performed with a dual&#8208;compartment flow reactor equipped with a membrane separator. The problems caused by the membrane separator, such as scaling&#8208;up, complicated operational control and materials costs can be solved using a membrane free single&#8208;compartment reactor. Here we demonstrate anode reaction control for a single&#8208;compartment CO2R flow reactor using a surface&#8208;activated BDD cathode and achieve a Faradaic efficiency for formic acid production of over 70%.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Diselenation of BODIPY Fluorophores for Bioimaging Applications and Sensitization of 1O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a rapid, efficient, and scope&#8208;extensive approach for the late&#8208;stage electrochemical diselenation of BODIPYs. Photophysical analyses reveal red&#8208;shifted absorption &#8208; corroborated by TD&#8208;DFT and DLPNO&#8208;STEOM&#8208;CCSD computations &#8208; and color&#8208;tunable emission with large Stokes shifts in the selenium&#8208;containing derivatives compared to their precursors. In addition, due to the presence of the heavy Se atoms, competitive ISC generates triplet states which sensitize 1O2 and display phosphorescence in PMMA films at RT and in a frozen glass matrix at 77 K. Importantly, the selenium&#8208;containing BODIPYs demonstrate the ability to selectively stain lipid droplets, exhibiting distinct fluorescence in both green and red channels. This work highlights the potential of electrochemistry as an efficient method for synthesizing unique emission&#8208;tunable fluorophores with broad&#8208;ranging applications in bioimaging and related fields</dc:description>

         <title>General Construction of Asymmetric Amine Ethers via Efficient Transesterification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel method to prepare asymmetric amine ether is reported. Tertiary amine alcohol hydrogen sulfate intermediates are prepared through a reactive distillation process, followed by the transesterification process to afford eventually asymmetric amine ethers. Experiments and DFT calculations revealed the essential roles the moderately acidic sulfate group plays in the highly selective monoesterification process. This clean method is tolerant towards various functional groups with good yields under relatively rather short reaction time mild condition, which is obviously superior compared to the conventional processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Ionic Li+@C70 Endohedral Fullerene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first C70&#8208;based &#8220;ionic&#8221; endohedral fullerene, Li+@C70, was synthesized and isolated as PF6&#8722; and TFSI&#8722; salts. The 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ion pair structures were fully confirmed by spectroscopic analyses and X&#8208;ray crystallography. Optical spectroscopy as well as electrochemical measurements revealed that the encapsulated Li+ strongly stabilized the orbital energy of C70 through Coulomb interaction without changing the original energy gap and orbital degeneracy of the cage.







Abstract
Ion&#8208;endohedral&#8208;fullerene has attracted growing interest due to the unique electronic and structural characteristics arising from its distinctive ionic nature. Although there has been only one reported ion&#8208;encapsulated fullerene, Li+@C60, a significant number of fundamental and applied studies have been conducted, making a substantial impact not only in chemistry and physics but also across various interdisciplinary research fields. Nevertheless, studies on ion&#8208;endohedral fullerenes are still in their infancy due to the limitations in variety, and hence, it remains an open question how the size and symmetry of fullerene, as well as the motion and position of the encapsulated ion, affect their physical/chemical properties. Herein, we report the synthesis of lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;endohedral [70]fullerene (Li+@C70 X&#8722;, X=PF6&#8722; and TFSI&#8722;), a novel ionic endohedral fullerene. X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed the encapsulation of Li+ by C70 cage as well as its ion&#8208;pair structure stabilized by external TFSI&#8722; counter anion. The encapsulated Li+ drastically lowered the orbital energy of the C70 cage by Coulomb interactions but did not affect the orbital energy gap and degeneracy. DFT studies were also performed, which supported the experimentally observed electronic effects caused by the encapsulated Li+.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for the synthesis of higher&#8208;order iptycenes using an &#8220;ambident anthracene&#8221; building block is presented. For that purpose, an iterative elongation strategy involving the ring&#8208;opening of an endoxide to give a highly reactive anthranoxide, followed by a Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with an aryne was used. The method systematically provides higher&#8208;order iptycenes, including trideciptycene, which is the longest&#8208;chain iptycene synthesized so far.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208; and Amine&#8208; Promoted Multielectron Autoredox Transformation of Nitromethane: Multicomponent Access to Thiourea Derivatives</title>

Synthesis of thioureas using elemental sulfur and nitromethane as the starting materials: multi&#8208;electron auto&#8208;redox property of nitromethane in the presence of sulfur and amines, delivering thiourea products without any added oxidant or reductant.







Abstract
Thiourea derivatives are in&#8208;demand motifs in organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry and material science, yet redox methods for the synthesis that start from safe, simple, inexpensive and readily available feedstocks are scarce. In this article, we disclose the synthesis of these motifs using elemental sulfur and nitromethane as the starting materials. The method harnesses the multi&#8208;electron auto&#8208;redox property of nitromethane in the presence of sulfur and amines, delivering thiourea products without any added oxidant or reductant. Extension of this reaction to cyclizable amines and/or higher homologues of nitromethane led to a wide range of nitrogen heterocycles and thioamides. Operationally simple, the reactions are scalable, tolerate a wide range of functional groups, and can be employed for the direct functionalization of natural products. Mechanistically, the nitro group was found to act as an oxidant leaving group, being reduced to ammonia whereas sulfur, along with the role of a sulfur building block for the thiocarbonyl group, behaved as a complementary reductant, being oxidized to sulfate.

         <title>B&#8208;P Coupling: Metal Stabilized Phosphinoborate Complexes</title>

Synthesis and characterization of phosphinoborate complex through B&#8208;P coupling reaction involving Ru&#8208;(&#963;&#8208;borate) species and chlorodiphenyl phosphine.







Abstract
In an effort to establish B&#8208;P coupling reactions without the use of phosphine&#8208;borane dehydrocoupling agent, we have developed a new synthetic methodology employing group&#8197;8 metal &#963;&#8208;borate complex [{&#954;3&#8208;H,S,S&#8242;&#8208;BH2L2}Ru{&#954;3&#8208;H,H,S&#8208;BH3L}] (L=NC5H4S), 1. Treatment of 1 with chlorodiphenyl phosphine (PPh2Cl) yielded 1,5&#8208;P,S chelated Ru&#8208;dihydridoborate species [PPh2H{&#954;3&#8208;H,H,S&#8208;BH(OH)L}Ru{&#954;2&#8208;P,S&#8208;(Ph2P)BH2L}], 2. The insertion of phosphine moiety (PPh2) by the cleavage of 3c&#8211;2e &#963;(Ru&#8230;H&#8208;B) bonding interaction led to the formation of B&#8208;P bond. The &#954;2&#8208;P,S chelated six&#8208;membered ring adopted a boat conformation in complex 2. The heterocycle is made of all different atoms, which is one of the rarest examples of heteroatomic ring systems. Theoretical outcomes demonstrated the electronic insight of B&#8208;P coupling and stabilization through transition metal. In order to explore an alternate route of B&#8208;P bond formation, we have further explored the reaction of 1 and Ru&#8208;bis(dihydridoborate) complex, 5 with secondary phosphine oxide (SPO). Although, thermolysis of 1 with diphenylphosphine oxide yielded analogous &#963;&#8208;borate complex 3, the similar reaction of 5 at room temperature led to the formation of novel phosphinous(III) acid incorporated Ru(&#963;&#8208;borate)(dihydridoborate) complex, 6. In a similar fashion, the reaction of 5 with phosphite ligand generated Ru(&#963;&#8208;borate)(dihydridoborate) complex, 7, which is analogous to 6.

         <title>Simulating non&#8208;adiabatic dynamics of photoexcited phenyl azide: Investigating electronic and structural relaxation en route to the formation of phenyl nitrene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photolysis of phenyl azide lead by coupled nuclear motion results in excited singlet photoproduct. Surface hopping simulations based on multi&#8208;reference model reveal that the second electronic excited state steers the N2 elimination, accompanied by synchronous bond elongation and angular rotation.







Abstract
Excited state molecular dynamics simulations of the photoexcited phenyl azide have been performed. The semi&#8208;classical surface hopping approximation has enabled an unconstrained analysis of the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom which contribute to the molecular dissociation of phenyl azide into phenyl nitrene and molecular nitrogen. The significance of the second singlet excited state in leading the photodissociation has been established through electronic structure calculations, based on multi&#8208;configurational schemes, and state population dynamics. The investigations on the structural dynamics have revealed the N&#8722;N bond separation to be accompanied by synchronous changes in the azide N&#8722;N&#8722;N bond angle. The 100&#8197;fs simulation results in a nitrene fragment that is electronically excited in the singlet manifold.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Phosphoryltriacetates from White Phosphorus via Visible Light Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
Direct Synthesis of Phosphoryltriacetates from White Phosphorus via Visible Light Catalysis: The reaction of P4 with &#945;&#8208;bromo esters using fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 as the photocatalyst and blue LEDs (456&#8197;nm) as the light source was developed for the first time to afford a series of phosphoryltriacetates. This approach features mild reaction conditions and simple operational process without chlorination.







Abstract
Organophosphorus compounds (OPCs) are widely used in many fields. However, traditional synthetic routes in the industry usually involve multistep and hazardous procedures. Therefore, it's of great significance to construct such compounds in an environmentally&#8208;friendly and facile way. Herein, a photoredox catalytic method has been developed to construct novel phosphoryltriacetates. Using fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 (ppy=2&#8208;phenylpyridine) as the photocatalyst and blue LEDs (456&#8197;nm) as the light source, white phosphorus can react with &#945;&#8208;bromo esters smoothly to generate phosphoryltriacetates in moderate to good yields. This one&#8208;step approach features mild reaction conditions and simple operational process without chlorination.

This one-step approach features mild reaction conditions and simple operational process without chlorination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Tripodal molecules Tr&#8208;Np3 and Tr&#8208;T&#8208;Np3 exhibited absorption in 290&#8211;480&#8197;nm range in solutions and optical bandgaps (Egopt) of 3.10&#8197;eV and 2.64&#8197;eV, respectively. Electron mobilities of 5.24&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2/Vs and 6.14&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2/Vs were obtained for Tr&#8208;Np3 and Tr&#8208;T&#8208;Np3 respectively. Excellent photocatalytic abilities of compounds were observed towards highly selective formation of benzimidazoles through the oxidative condensation between o&#8208;phenylenediamines and carboxaldehydes.







Abstract
Tripodal donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) small molecules Tr&#8208;Np3 and Tr&#8208;T&#8208;Np3 consisting of triphenyl triazine and 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide, without and with a thiophene spacer have been synthesized. Their optical and redox properties were thoroughly investigated along with their utilization as photocatalysts in organic transformations. Compounds Tr&#8208;Np3 and Tr&#8208;T&#8208;Np3 showed broad absorption in the range of 290&#8211;480&#8197;nm in solutions and 300&#8211;510&#8197;nm in thin films. These tripodal molecules displayed wide optical bandgaps of (Egopt) 3.10&#8197;eV and 2.64&#8197;eV with very deep&#8208;lying HOMO energy levels (&#8722;6.60&#8197;eV and &#8722;6.03&#8197;eV) and low&#8208;lying LUMO levels (&#8722;3.50&#8197;eV and &#8722;3.40&#8197;eV). Appreciable electron mobilities of 5.24&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2/Vs and 6.14&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2/Vs were obtained for compounds Tr&#8208;Np3 and Tr&#8208;T&#8208;Np3 respectively by space&#8208;charge limited current (SCLC) measurements. Metal&#8208;free tripodal molecules Tr&#8208;Np3 and Tr&#8208;T&#8208;Np3 showed excellent photocatalytic abilities towards condensation of aromatic aldehydes and o&#8208;phenylenediamine followed by cyclization under visible light to yield benzimidazole derivatives that are of high medicinal value.

         <title>Optical Cavity Design and Functionality for Molecular Strong Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cavity strong coupling offers prospects for showcasing captivating photochemical or photophysical phenomena. Recently, significant advancements have been made in the fabrication of microcavities specifically designed for strong coupling. The development of microcavities with multiple functions beyond simply optical resonators allows further investigation of strong coupling systems and opens the way for practical applications.







Abstract
Optical cavity/molecule strong coupling offers attractive opportunities to modulate photochemical or photophysical processes. When atoms or molecules are placed in an optical cavity, they can coherently exchange photonic energy with optical cavity vacuum fields, entering the strong coupling interaction regime. Recent work suggests that the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of molecules can be significantly changed by strong coupling, resulting in the emergence of intriguing photochemical and photophysical phenomena. As more and more physico&#8208;chemical systems are studied under strong coupling conditions, optical cavities have also advanced in their sophistication, responsiveness, and (multi)functionality. In this review, we highlight some of these recent developments, particularly focusing on Fabry&#8211;Perot microcavities.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of N&#8208;formamides by Integrating Reductive Amination of Ketones and Aldehydes with CO2 Fixation in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru/MFM&#8208;300(Cr) was used as catalyst for the one&#8208;pot N&#8208;formylation of both aldehydes and ketones (30 substrates) in high yield. Synchrotron PXRD reveals the activation of carbonyl compounds via confined binding within MFM&#8208;300(Cr). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic analysis and control experiments suggest formate species as the intermediate derived from the reduction of CO2 and reveal the possible reaction pathway.







Abstract
Formamides are important feedstocks for the manufacture of many fine chemicals. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthesis of formamides relies on the use of an excess amount of reagents, giving copious waste and thus poor atom&#8208;economy. Here, we report the first example of direct synthesis of N&#8208;formamides by coupling two challenging reactions, namely reductive amination of carbonyl compounds, particularly biomass&#8208;derived aldehydes and ketones, and fixation of CO2 in the presence of H2 over a metal&#8208;organic framework supported ruthenium catalyst, Ru/MFM&#8208;300(Cr). Highly selective production of N&#8208;formamides has been observed for a wide range of carbonyl compounds. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray powder diffraction reveals the presence of strong host&#8208;guest binding interactions via hydrogen bonding and parallel&#8208;displaced &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions between the catalyst and adsorbed substrates facilitating the activation of substrates and promoting selectivity to formamides. The use of multifunctional porous catalysts to integrate CO2 utilisation in the synthesis of formamide products will have a significant impact in the sustainable synthesis of feedstock chemicals.

         <title>Revisiting Peri&#8208;Aryloxyquinones: From a Forgotten Photochromic System to a Promising Tool for Emerging Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Emerging applications of photochromic compounds demand new molecular designs that can be inspired by some longknown yet currently forgotten classes of photoswitches. In the present review, we remind the community about PeriAryloxyQuinones (PAQs) and their unique photoswitching behavior originally discovered more than 50 years ago. At the heart of this phenomenon is the light&#8208;induced migration of an aromatic moiety (arylotropy) in peri&#8208;aryloxy&#8208;substituted quinones resulting in ana&#8208;quinones. PAQs feature absorbance of both isomers in the visible spectral region, photochromism in the amorphous and crystalline state, and thermal stability of the photogenerated ana&#8208;isomer. Particularly noticeable is the high sensitivity of the ana&#8208;isomer towards nucleophiles in solution. In addition to the mechanism of molecular photochromism and the underlaying structure&#8208;switch relationships, we analyze potential applications and prospects of aryloxyquinones in optically switchable materials and devices. Due to their ability to efficiently photoswitch in the solid state, PAQs are indeed attractive candidates for such materials and devices, including electronics (optically controllable circuits, switches, transistors, memories, and displays), porous crystalline materials, crystalline actuators, photoactivated sensors, and many more. This review is intended to serve as a guide for researchers who wish to use photoswitchable PAQs in the development of new photocontrollable materials, devices, and processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards a General Access to 1&#8208;Azaspirocyclic Systems via Photoinduced, Reductive Decarboxylative Radical Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A convenient and versatile approach to important 1&#8208;azaspirocyclic systems relevant to medicinal chemistry and natural products is reported herein. The main strategy relies on a reductive decarboxylative cyclization of redox&#8208;active esters which can be rapidly assembled from abundant cyclic azaacids and tailored acceptor sidechains, with a focus on alkyne acceptors enabling the generation of useful exo&#8208;alkene moieties. Diastereoconvergent variants were studied and could be achieved either through remote stereocontrol or conformational restriction in bicyclic carbamate substrates.

         <title>Borirenes and Boriranes: Development and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strained compounds constitute a highly topical area of research in chemistry. Borirene and borirane both feature a BC2 three&#8208;membered ring. They can be viewed as the analogous compounds derived from cyclopropane and cyclopropene, where a CH2 unit of the carbonaceous counterparts is replaced with BH, respectively. Indeed, this structural variation introduces numerous intriguing aspects. For instance, borirane and borirene are both Lewis acidic due to the presence of a tricoordinate borane center. In addition, borirene is 2&#960; aromatic according to H&#252;ckel's rule. On the other hand, recent successful syntheses of benzoborienes and their carborane&#8208;based three&#8208;dimensional analogues have introduced novel perspectives to this field. Their applications as valuable "BC2" synthons have become increasingly evident along with the newly disclosed reactivity. Additionally, the boosted Lewis acidity of carborane&#8208;fused boriranes, thanks to the potent electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of o&#8208;carborane, combined with their readiness for ring enlargement, makes them promising candidates as electron&#8208;accepting building blocks in the construction of chemically responsive luminescent materials. This review provides a summary of the synthesis and reactivity of borirene and borirane derivatives, with the aim of encouraging the design of new borierene&#8208; and borirane&#8208;based molecules and inspiring further exploration of their potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterometallic AuI6AgI6 Macrocyclic Cluster Templated by a Supramolecular Melamine Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of supramolecular templates in aligning atomically precise heterometal arrays is important for pursuing functional materials. Herein, we report that a bilayered supramolecular tri&#8208;deprotonated melamine dimer functions as an effective template in the construction of a heterometallic gold(I)&#8208;silver(I) macrocyclic cluster [&#956;6&#8208;(C3N6H3)3&#8211;]2&#8211;AuI6AgI6. X&#8208;ray single crystal structural analysis showed that a crown&#8208;like AuI6AgI6 macrocycle is aligned around two parallelly stacked &#956;6&#8208;(C3N6H3)3&#8211; moieties hold together with &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. Theoretical calculations revealed that the [&#956;6&#8208;(C3N6H3)3&#8211;]2 motif dominantly contributes to the near&#8208;occupied orbitals in the electronic structure, which is closely related to its luminescence properties. This work demonstrates that the supramolecular templates containing multiple symmetric binding sites may present a facile approach in the construction of functional metal clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferroelectricity and Related Properties of Nitratecadmate(II) Hybrid with Metal&#8208;Vacancy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By substitution of NH4+ ion of a hexagonal perovskite structure with Cd2+ ion, we obtained a new metal&#8208;vacancy compound (H2dabco)2Cd(H2O)2(NO3)6. The coordination twist of the Cd&#8208;vacancy leads to instability of the lattices, structural phase transitions and excellent ferroelectricity. This result reveals that the vacancy can be utilized as an element to produce ferroelectric complexes.







Abstract
All crystals are not ideal, and many of their properties are often determined not by the regular arrangement of atoms, but by the irregular arrangement of crystal defects. Many properties of materials can be controlled effectively by proper use of solid defects. By substitution of NH4+ ion of a hexagonal perovskite structure (H2dabco)(NH4)(NO3)3 (dabco=1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, 1) with Cd2+ ion, we obtained a new metal&#8208;vacancy compound (H2dabco)2Cd(H2O)2(NO3)6 (2). It exhibits a ferroelectric&#8208;paraelectric phase transition at 261&#8197;K. A comparison of the various&#8208;temperature single&#8208;crystal structures indicates that the coordination twist of Cd2+ ion leads to instability of the lattices and excellent ferroelectricity. These findings reveal that the vacancy can be utilized as an element to produce ferroelectricity and may start the chemistry of metal&#8208;vacancy coordination compounds. These findings reveals that the vacancy can be utilized as an effective means to tune the symmetry and produce ferroelectricity.

         <title>Polymorphism&#8208;driven Distinct Nanomechanical, Optical, Photophysical, and Conducting Properties in a Benzothiophene&#8208;quinoline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymorphic forms of ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(1&#8208;benzothiophene&#8208;2&#8208;yl)quinolone&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate with distinct packing arrangements and interactions, vary in their nanomechanical response, photophysical, optical waveguiding, and conducting properties, highlight the significant role of polymorphism in modulating the microstructures in molecular materials and thereby their functional properties. DFT calculations on the single molecule and crystal dimorphs corroborate the experimental photophysical and conductive findings.







Abstract
Polymorphic forms of organic conjugated small molecules, with their unique molecular shapes, packing arrangements, and interaction patterns, provide an excellent opportunity to uncover how their microstructures influence their observable properties. Ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(1&#8208;benzothiophene&#8208;2&#8208;yl)quinoline&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate (BZQ) exists as dimorphs with distinct crystal habits &#8211; blocks (BZB) and needles (BZN). The crystal forms differ in their molecular arrangements &#8211; BZB has a slip&#8208;stacked column&#8208;like structure in contrast to a zig&#8208;zag crystal packing with limited &#960;&#8208;overlap in BZN. The BZB crystals characterized by extended &#960;&#8208;stacking along [100] demonstrated semiconductor behavior, whereas the BZN, with its zig&#8208;zag crystal packing and limited stacking characteristics, was reckoned as an insulator. Monotropically related crystal forms also differ in their nanomechanical properties, with BZB crystals being considerably softer than BZN crystals. This discrepancy in mechanical behavior can be attributed to the distinct molecular arrangements adopted by each crystal form, resulting in unique mechanisms to relieve the strain generated during nanoindentation experiments. Waveguiding experiments on the acicular crystals of BZN revealed the passive waveguiding properties. Excitation of these crystals using a 532&#8197;nm laser confirmed the propagation of elastically scattered photons (green) and the subsequent generation of inelastically scattered (orange) photons by the crystals. Further, the dimorphs display dissimilar photoluminescence properties; they are both blue&#8208;emissive, but BZN displays twice the quantum yield of BZB. The study underscores the integral role of polymorphism in modulating the mechanical, photophysical, and conducting properties of functional molecular materials. Importantly, our findings reveal the existence of light&#8208;emitting crystal polymorphs with varying electric conductivity, a relatively scarce phenomenon in the literature.

         <title>Bisurea&#8208;Based Supramolecular Polymers for Tunable Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2,4&#8208;Toluene diisocyanate (TDI) was used as starting material to obtain functional and desymmetrized supramolecular monomers that assemble into fibrous structures in water. The resulting supramolecular polymers are dynamic, biocompatible and stable in cellular media, which opens up the use of the UT motif to access tunable biomaterials.







Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble supramolecular polymers show great potential to develop dynamic biomaterials with tailored properties. Here, we elucidate the morphology, stability and dynamicity of supramolecular polymers derived from bisurea&#8208;based monomers. An accessible synthetic approach from 2,4&#8208;toluene diisocyanate (TDI) as the starting material is developed. TDI has two isocyanates that differ in intrinsic reactivity, which allows to obtain functional, desymmetrized monomers in a one&#8208;step procedure.

&lt;p&gt;2,4-Toluene diisocyanate (TDI) was used as starting material to obtain functional and desymmetrized supramolecular monomers that assemble into fibrous structures in water. The resulting supramolecular polymers are dynamic, biocompatible and stable in cellular media, which opens up the use of the &lt;b&gt;UT&lt;/b&gt; motif to access tunable biomaterials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water-soluble supramolecular polymers show great potential to develop dynamic biomaterials with tailored properties. Here, we elucidate the morphology, stability and dynamicity of supramolecular polymers derived from bisurea-based monomers. An accessible synthetic approach from 2,4-toluene diisocyanate (TDI) as the starting material is developed. TDI has two isocyanates that differ in intrinsic reactivity, which allows to obtain functional, desymmetrized monomers in a one-step procedure. We explore how the hydrophobic/hydrophilic ratio affects the properties of the formed supramolecular polymers by increasing the number of methylene units from 10 to 12 keeping the hydrophilic hexa(ethylene glycol) constant. All bisurea-based monomers form long, fibrous structures with 3&#8211;5 monomers in the cross-section in water, indicating a proper hydrophobic\hydrophilic balance. The stability of the supramolecular polymers increases with an increasing amount of methylene units, whereas the dynamic nature of the monomers decreases. The introduction of one Cy3 dye affords modified supramolecular monomers, which co-assemble with the unmodified monomers into fibrous structures. All systems show excellent water-compatibility and no toxicity for different cell-lines. Importantly, in cell culture media, the fibrous structures remain present, highlighting the stability of these supramolecular polymers in physiological conditions. The results obtained here motivate further investigation of these bisurea-based building blocks as dynamic biomaterial.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enzymatic Resolution and Decarboxylative Functionalization of &#945;&#8208;Sulfinyl Esters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic resolution of &#945;&#8208;sulfinyl esters gives recovered ester and &#945;&#8208;sulfinyl acid in high enantiomeric purity. Decarboxylative functionalization provides access to a wide range of optically active sulfoxides in both enantiomeric forms.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Sulfinyl esters can be readily prepared through thiol substitution of &#945;&#8208;bromo esters followed by oxidation to the sulfoxide. Enzymatic resolution with lipoprotein lipase provides both the unreacted esters and corresponding &#945;&#8208;sulfinyl carboxylic acids in high yields and enantiomeric ratios. Subsequent decarboxylative halogenation, dihalogenation, trihalogenation and cross&#8208;coupling gives rise to functionalized sulfoxides. The method has been applied to the asymmetric synthesis of a potent inhibitor of 15&#8208;prostaglandin dehydrogenase.

         <title>Cooperation between p&#8208;Block Elements and Redox&#8208;Active Ligands: Stoichiometric and Catalytic Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Ignoble&#8221; prized: The use of redox&#8208;active ligands that behave as electron reservoirs and are able to donate or accept electrons on demand during a catalytic cycle has emerged as a powerful approach to engage cheap early transition metals in catalytic transformations traditionally reserved for their &#8220;noble cousins&#8221;. This concept article explores the possibilities that are opened by the extrapolation of that strategy to the design of catalysts based on p&#8208;block elements.







Abstract
The relevance acquired by redox&#8208;active ligands in modern catalysis stems from their facile delivery and acceptance of electrons, either to the metal they coordinate to, or directly to an incoming substrate that also binds the central metal. Doing that, they generate coordinated radicals and provide access to more than one spin state during the catalytic cycle. As a consequence, the new reaction barriers are reduced when compared to similar processes that are restricted to a single spin surface. The principles that govern this genuine approach to catalyst design are well&#8208;established, and their implementation has allowed the development of synthetically useful catalytic transformations; however, the extension of the concept to species in which p&#8208;block elements take the role of central atoms remains largely underdeveloped. Through discussion of the key achievements and recent progress, this Concept Article highlights this original approach to designing (organo)catalysts, discloses the progress achieved, and also reveals the many shortcomings that still exist in the field.

         <title>Multifunctional Photoelectroactive Materials for Optoelectronic Applications Based on Thieno[3,4&#8208;b]pyrazines and Thieno[1,2,5]thiadiazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligomers containing electron donor units based on a carbazole&#8208;thiophene derivative and three different acceptor units (Bz, Pz, Tz) were synthesized and characterized. These structural modifications promote better &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization due to a progressive enhancement of the quinoidal character (Bz&lt;Pz&lt;Tz) and facilitate photoinduced charge transfer processes in optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
In this study, we introduce a novel family of symmetrical thiophene&#8208;based small molecules with a Donor&#8208;Acceptor&#8208;Donor structure. These compounds feature three different acceptor units: benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (Bz), thieno[3,4&#8208;b]pyrazine (Pz), and thieno[1,2,5]thiadiazole (Tz), coupled with electron donor units based on a carbazole&#8208;thiophene derivative. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT), we investigate how the molecular geometry and strength of the central acceptor unit impact the redox and spectroscopic properties. Notably, the incorporation of Pz and Tz moieties induces a significant redshift in the absorption and emission spectra, which extend into the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region, simultaneously reducing their energy gaps (~1.4&#8211;1.6&#8197;eV). This shift is attributed to the increased coplanarity of the oligomeric inner core, both in the ground (S0) and excited (S1) states, due to the enhanced quinoidal character as supported by bond&#8208;length alternation (BLA) analysis. These structural changes promote better &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization and facilitate photoinduced charge transfer processes in optoelectronic devices. Notably, we show that Pz&#8208; and Tz&#8208;containing molecules exhibit NIR electrochromic behavior and present ambivalent character in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. Finally, theoretical calculations suggest that these molecules could serve as effective two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) probes, further expanding their potential in optoelectronic applications.

A non&#8208;solvated alkyl&#8208;substituted Al(I) anion dimer was synthesized by a reduction of haloalumane precursor using a mechanochemical method. The crystallographic and theoretical analysis revealed its structure and electronic properties. Experimental XPS analysis of the Al(I) anions with reference compounds revealed the lower Al&#8197;2p binding energy corresponds to the lower oxidation state of Al species. It should be emphasized that the experimentally obtained XPS binding energies were reproduced by delta SCF calculations and were linearly correlated with NPA charges and 2p orbital energies.

         <title>Barbier Polymerization&#8208;Induced Emission towards Fully Substituted Polyethylene Analogues with Non&#8208;Traditional Intrinsic Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation of fully substituted polyethylene analogues (FSPEA) and their non&#8208;traditional intrinsic luminescence (NTIL) are attractive, especially for substitutions with relatively larger atomic radius than fluorine atom. Here, Barbier polymerization&#8208;induced emission (PIE) is demonstrated as a universal method for the molecular design of NTIL type FSPEAs with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics. Further potential applications for explosive detection, artificial light&#8208;harvesting system and white phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diode are investigated.







Abstract
The properties of polyethylene are highly dependent on the variety and quantity of substitutions. Generally, polyethylene can only be fully substituted with fluorine atoms, mainly e.&#8201;g., polytetrafluoroethylene and nafion, because atomic radius of fluorine atom is small enough.

&lt;p&gt;The preparation of fully substituted polyethylene analogues (FSPEA) and their non-traditional intrinsic luminescence (NTIL) are attractive, especially for substitutions with relatively larger atomic radius than fluorine atom. Here, Barbier polymerization-induced emission (PIE) is demonstrated as a universal method for the molecular design of NTIL type FSPEAs with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The properties of polyethylene are highly dependent on the variety and quantity of substitutions. Generally, polyethylene can only be fully substituted with fluorine atoms, mainly e.&#8201;g., polytetrafluoroethylene and nafion, because atomic radius of fluorine atom is small enough. The preparation of fully substituted polyethylene analogues (FSPEA) and their non-traditional intrinsic luminescence (NTIL) are attractive, especially for substitutions with relatively larger atomic radii than a fluorine atom. Here, Barbier polymerization-induced emission (PIE) is demonstrated as a universal method for the molecular design of NTIL type FSPEAs with intriguing aggregation-induced emission (AIE) behaviors. Through Barbier polymerization of diphenyldichloromethane and different peroxyesters in the presence of Mg in one pot, a series of FSPEAs, including polytriphenylethanol (PTPE), polydiphenylfurylethanol (PDPFE), polydiphenylthiophenylethanol (PDPTE) and polydiphenylnaphthylethanol (PDPNE) have been successfully prepared. Further potential applications for explosive detection, artificial light-harvesting system and white phosphor-converted light-emitting diode are investigated. Therefore, this work opens up a new approach for the molecular design of FSPEA with non-conjugated luminescence, which may cause inspirations to different research fields like polyolefin and luminescent materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Offset Patterned Cross&#8208;&#946; Structure in Assemblies of C3&#8208;Symmetric Peptide Amphiphiles</title>

Offset patterned cross&#8208;&#946; architecture arises in C3&#8208;symmetric peptide amphiphile assemblies as a result of spatial limitations of the &#946;&#8208;sheet dimensions.







Abstract
Developing peptide&#8208;based materials with controlled morphology is a critical theme of soft matter research. Herein, we report the formation of a novel, patterned cross&#8208;&#946; structure formed by self&#8208;assembled C3&#8208;symmetric peptide amphiphiles based on diphenylalanine and benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA). The cross&#8208;&#946; motif is an abundant structural element in amyloid fibrils and aggregates of fibril&#8208;forming peptides, including diphenylalanine. The incorporation of topological constraints on one edge of the diphenylalanine fragment limits the number of &#946;&#8208;strands in &#946;&#8208;sheets and leads to the creation of an unconventional offset&#8208;patterned cross&#8208;&#946; structure consisting of short 3&#215;2 parallel &#946;&#8208;sheets stabilized by phenylalanine zippers. In the reported assembly, two patterned cross&#8208;&#946; structures bind parallel arrays of BTA stacks in a superstructure within a single&#8208;molecule&#8208;thick nanoribbon. In addition to a threefold network of hydrogen bonds in the BTA stack, each molecule becomes simultaneously bound by hydrogen bonds from three &#946;&#8208;sheets and four phenylalanine zippers. The diffuse layer of alkyl chains with terminal polar groups prevents the nanoribbons from merging and stabilizes cross&#8208;&#946;&#8208;structure in water. Our results provide a simple approach to the incorporation of novel patterned cross&#8208;&#946; motifs into supramolecular superstructures and shed light on the general mechanism of &#946;&#8208;sheet formation in C3&#8208;symmetric peptide amphiphiles.

         <title>Intramolecular Carboxyamidation of Alkyne&#8208;Tethered O&#8208;Acylhydroxamates through Formation of Fe(III)&#8208;Nitrenoids</title>

Zip and shift: The intramolecular carboxyamidations of alkyne&#8208;tethered O&#8208;acylhydroxamates followed by thermally induced spontaneous or 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine&#8208;catalyzed O&#8594;O or O&#8594;N acyl group migration can generate a wide variety of N,O&#8208;containing heterocycles. DFT study suggests the Fe&#8208;nitrenoid intermediate preferentially reacts in a radical manifold to mediates a stepwise C&#8722;N/C&#8722;O bond formation rather than a concerted [3+2] cycloaddition mechanism.







Abstract
We developed intramolecular carboxyamidations of alkyne&#8208;tethered O&#8208;acylhydroxamates followed by either thermally induced spontaneous or 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine&#8208;catalyzed O&#8594;O or O&#8594;N acyl group migration. Under iron&#8208;catalyzed conditions, the carboxyamidation products were generated in high yield from both Z&#8208;alkene and arene&#8208;tethered substrates. DFT calculations indicate that the iron&#8208;catalyzed carboxyamidation proceeds via a stepwise mechanism involving iron&#8208;imidyl radical cyclization followed by intramolecular acyloxy transfer from the iron center to the alkenyl radical center to furnish the cis&#8208;carboxyamidation product. Upon treatment with 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine, the Z&#8208;alkene&#8208;tethered carboxyamidation products underwent selective O&#8594;O acyl migration to generate 2&#8208;acyloxy&#8208;5&#8208;acyl pyrroles. Thermal O&#8594;N acyl migration occurs during carboxyamidation if the Z&#8208;alkene linker contains an alkyl or an aryl substituent at the &#946;&#8208;position of the carbonyl group. On the other hand, the arene linker&#8208;containing compounds selectively undergo O&#8594;N acyl migration to generate N&#8208;acyl&#8208;3&#8208;acylisoindolinones, and the corresponding O&#8594;O acyl migration forming isoindole derivatives was not observed.

         <title>Unveiling the Potential of Heterogeneous Catalysts for Molecular Solar Thermal Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trapping sunlight energy into chemical bonds has become an important method for storing renewable energy and releasing it on demand. To illustrate the new catalyst&#8208;testing protocol, a cyclic road shows the photoisomerization process trapping sunlight (top) and the back&#8208;conversion catalytic reaction releasing heat. The bottom wheel indicates that up to 27 different catalysts were studied. More information can be found in the Research Article by I. Funes&#8208;Ardoiz, D. Sampedro and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303230).

         <title>Reticular Synthesis of Flexible Rare&#8208;Earth Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Control of Structural Dynamics and Sorption Properties through Ligand Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reticular chemistry was successfully applied in highly flexible rare&#8208;earth MOFs to gain control over structural dynamics and gas/vapor sorption properties. The reported materials display a rare continuous&#8208;breathing behaviour and an unprecedented gas/vapor trapping property, resembling the function of Venus&#8208;flytrap, and could be used for the selective removal of harmful gases and volatile organic compounds. More information can be found in the Research Article by P.&#8197;N. Trikalitis and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302709).

         <title>S&#8208;induced Phase Change Forming In2O3/In2S3 Heterostructure for Photoelectrochemical Glucose Sensor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interface construction through experimental control of the introduced anions allows the tuning of the energy bands of photoanode materials. The cooperative energy band and electronical structure of In2O3/In2S3 resulted in a photocurrent of 0.6&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2 when exposed to light irradiation. This strategy has practical significance for developing low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance PEC sensors.







Abstract
In the past several decades, Photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensing still remains a great challenge to design highly&#8208;efficient semiconductor photocatalysts via a facile method. It is of much importance to design and synthesize various novel nanostructured sensing materials for further improving the response performance. Herein, we present an In2O3/In2S3 heterostructure obtained by combining microwave assisted hydrothermal method with S&#8208;induced phase change, whose energy band and electronic structure could be adjusted by changing the S content. Combining theoretical calculation and spectroscopic techniques, the introduction of sulfur was proved to produce multifunctional interfaces, inducing the change of phase, oxygen vacancies and band gap, which accelerates the separation of photoexcited carriers and reduces their recombination, improving the electronic injection efficiency around the interface of In2O3/In2S3. As anticipated, an enhanced glucose response performance with a photocurrent of 0.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a linear range of 0.1&#8211;1&#8197;mM and a detection limit as low as 14.5&#8197;&#956;M has been achieved based on the In2O3/In2S3 heterostructure, which is significant superior over its pure In2O3 and S&#8208;doped In2O3 counterparts. This efficient interfacial strategy may open a new route to manipulate the electrical structure, and energy band structure regulation of sensing material to improve the performance of photoelectrodes for PEC.

This strategy has practical significance for developing low-cost, high-performance PEC sensors.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid crystalline&#160;nanoparticles (LC NPs) are a kind&#160;of polymer&#160;NPs&#160;with LC mesogens, which can form special anisotropic morphologies due to the influence of LC ordering.&#160;Owing to the stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of the LC blocks,&#160;LC NPs show abundant&#160;morphology&#160;evolution behaviors in response to external regulation. LC NPs have&#160;great application&#160;potential in nano&#8208;devices, drug delivery, special fibers and other fields. Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) method can synthesize LC NPs at&#160;high solid content, reducing&#160;the harsh demand for reaction solvent of the LC monomers,&#160;being a better&#160;choice for large&#8208;scale production. In this review, we introduced&#160;recent research progress of PISA&#8208;LC NPs by dividing them into several parts according to the&#160;LC mesogen, and discussed&#160;the improvement of experimental conditions and the potential application of these&#160;polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Aromatic C(sp2)&#8722;H Functionalization by Consecutive Paired Electrolysis: Dibromination of Aryl Amines with Dibromoethane at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we disclose a facile and efficient electrochemical method for the dibromination of aryl amines by double functionalization of aromatic C(sp2)&#8722;H (both para and ortho) under metal&#8208; and external oxidant&#8208;free conditions at room temperature for the first time. The reaction is demonstrated using 1,2&#8208;dibromoethane to dibrominate a wide range of N&#8208;substituted aryl amines in a simple setup with C(+)/Pt(&#8722;) electrodes under mild reaction conditions. This transformation proceeds smoothly with a broad substrate scope affording the valuable and versatile N&#8208;substituted 2,4dibromoanilines in moderate to excellent yields with high regioselectivity. In this convergent paired electrolysis, anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction occur simultaneously to generate two intermediates, which are then coupled to furnish the product. It represents a distinctive approach to challenging redox&#8208;neutral reactions. The versatility of the electrochemical ortho&#8208;, paradibromination was reflected by unique regioselectivities for challenging aryl amines and gram&#8208;scale electrosynthesis without the use of a stoichiometric oxidant or an activating agent.</dc:description>

         <title>Photophysical Analysis of Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) Luminogens Based on Triphenylamine and Thiophene: Insights into Emission Behavior in Solution and PMMA Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) luminogens have garnered significant interest due to their distinctive applications in different applications. Among the diverse molecular architectures, those based on triphenylamine and thiophene hold prominence. However, a comprehensive understanding of the deactivation mechanism both in solution and films remains lacking. In this study, we synthesized and characterized spectroscopically two AIE luminogens: 5&#8208;(4&#8208;(bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)thiophene&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehyde (TTY) and 5'&#8208;(4&#8208;(bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)&#8208;[2,2'&#8208;bithiophene]&#8208;5&#8208;carbaldehyde (TTO). Photophysical and theoretical analyses were conducted in both solution and PMMA films to understand the deactivation mechanism of TTY and TTO. In diluted solutions, the emission behavior of TTY and TTO is influenced by the solvent, and the deactivation of the excited state can occur via Locally Excited (LE) or Planar Intramolecular Charge Transfer (PICT) state. In PMMA films, rotational and translational movements are constrained, necessitating emission solely from the LE state. Nevertheless, in the PMMA film, excimers&#8208;like structures form, resulting in the emergence of a longer wavelength band and a reduction in emission intensity. The zenith of emission intensity occurs when molecules are dispersed at higher concentrations within PMMA, effectively diminishing the likelihood of excimer&#8208;like formations. Luminescent Solar Concentrators (LSC) were fabricated to validate these findings, and the optical efficiency was studied at varying concentrations of luminogen and PMMA.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The implacable rise of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the atmosphere and acute water stress are one of the central challenges of our time. Present&#8208;day chemistry is strongly inclined towards more sustainable solutions. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), attributable to their structural designability with atomic precision, functionalizable chemical environment and robust extended architectures, have demonstrated promising performances in CO2 trapping and water harvesting from air. In this Review, we discuss the major developments in this field as well as sketch out the opportunities and shortcomings that remain over large&#8208;scale COF synthesis, device engineering, and long&#8208;term performance in real environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Vicinal Intermolecular Annulations of Iodoarenes, Indoles, and Carbazoles with Enynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vicinal annulation of 2&#8208;iodobenzoates, indoles, and carbazoles with 1,6&#8208;enynes is described. The relay involved 7&#8208;/8&#8208;membered palladacycles, leading to multicyclic scaffolds, which were readily diversified to an array of adducts (with new functional tethers and/or three contiguous stereocenters), in which a challenging benzylic monooxygenation was showcased.







Abstract
Reaching the formidable C&#8722;H corners has been one of the top priorities of organic chemists in the recent past. This prompted us to disclose herein a vicinal annulation of 2&#8208;iodo benzoates, indoles, and carbazoles with N&#8208;embedded 1,6&#8208;enynes through 7&#8208;/8&#8208;membered palladacycles. The relay does not require the assistance of any directing group, leading to multicyclic scaffolds, which are readily diversified to an array of adducts (with new functional tethers and/or three contiguous stereocenters), in which we showcase a rare benzylic mono&#8208;oxygenation.

         <title>Revealing the Unique Role of Water in the Formation of Benzothiazoles: an Experimental and Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of benzothiazoles catalyzed by water is studied using both experimental and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computational methods. Free energy calculations from DFT&#8208;metadynamics suggest water as the sole catalyst at room temperature. The influence of different aliphatic and aromatic substituents with varying electronic properties on the chemical reactivity is discussed.







Abstract
We present here a joint experimental and computational study on the formation of benzothiazoles. Our investigation reveals a green protocol for accessing benzothiazoles from acyl chlorides using either water alongside a reducing agent as the reaction medium or in combination with stoichiometric amounts of a weak acid, instead of the harsh conditions and catalysts previously reported. Specifically, we show that a protic solvent, particularly water, enables the formation of 2&#8208;substituted benzothiazoles from N&#8208;acyl 1,2&#8208;aminothiophenols already at room temperature, without the need for strong acids or metal catalysts. DFT Molecular Dynamics simulations coupled with advanced enhanced sampling techniques provide a clear understanding of the catalytic role of water. We demonstrate how bulk water &#8211; due to its extended network of hydrogen bonds and an efficient Grotthuss mechanism &#8211; provides a reaction path that strongly reduces the reaction barriers compared to aprotic environments, namely more than 80&#8197;kJ/mol for the first reaction step and 250&#8197;kJ/mol for the second. Finally, we discuss the influence of different aliphatic and aromatic substituents with varying electronic properties on chemical reactivity. Besides providing in&#8208;depth mechanistic insights, we believe that our findings pave the way for a greener route toward an important class of bioactive molecules.

         <title>Pyranthiones/Pyrones: &#8220;Click and Release&#8221; Donors for Subcellular Hydrogen Sulfide Delivery and Labeling
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Click and release reaction between pyrone/pyranthiones and bicyclononyne (BCN), features a release of CO2/COS with second&#8208;order rate constants comparable to Strain&#8208;Promoted Azide&#8208;Alkyne Cycloaddition reactions (SPAACs) for tunable H2S delivery and imaging in living cells.







Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), one of the most important gasotransmitters, plays a critical role in endogenous signaling pathways of many diseases. However, developing H2S donors with both tunable release kinetics and high release efficiency for subcellular delivery has been challenging. Here, we describe a click and release reaction between pyrone/pyranthiones and bicyclononyne (BCN). This reaction features a release of CO2/COS with second&#8208;order rate constants comparable to Strain&#8208;Promoted Azide&#8208;Alkyne Cycloaddition reactions (SPAACs). Interestingly, pyranthiones showed enhanced reaction rates compared to their pyrone counterparts. We investigated pyrone biorthogonality and demonstrated their utility in protein labeling applications. Moreover, we synthesized substituted pyranthiones with H2S release kinetics that can address the range of physiologically relevant H2S dynamics in cells and achieved quantitative H2S release efficiency in&#8197;vitro. Finally, we explored the potential of pyranthiones as H2S/COS donors for mitochondrial&#8208;targeted H2S delivery in living cells.

         <title>Dihydroguaiazulenide Complexes and Catalysts of Group 8&#8211;12 Transition Metals: Ligands from Renewable Feedstock Replace, even Outmatch Petrochemical Based Cyclopentadienyl Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclopentadienyl synthon (8&#8208;H&#8208;GuaH)Li isolated from guaiazulene (Gua) and LiH is used in ligand transfer towards selected homo&#8208; and heteroleptic group&#8197;8&#8211;10 metal complexes. Replacement of classical petrochemical based Cp metal chemistry by this renewable resources based Cp anion is not only cheaper. A representative precatalyst, [(8&#8208;H&#8208;GuaH)PtMe3], has proven an even much higher activity in photoactivated hydrosilylation of 1&#8208;octene at only 5&#8197;ppm load and 96&#8201;% conversion compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalyst [(CpR)GuaPtMe3] (R=H, Me). The platinum consumption could be reduced by about 90&#8201;%.







Abstract
We present an in&#8208;depth study of the sterically demanding Cp&#8208;synthon (8&#8208;H&#8208;GuaH)Li isolated from natural product guaiazulene (Gua) as a ligand transfer reagent towards late transition metal complex precursors. The synthesis and full characterization of selected, essentially unexplored homo&#8208; and heteroleptic 8&#8208;H&#8208;guaiazulenide complexes of iron, ruthenium, cobalt, rhodium, platinum, copper and zinc are discussed in detail. In order to demonstrate their potential in catalytic applications, [(GuaH)PtMe3] was selected. The latter proved an even higher catalytic activity in light induced olefin hydrosilylation at catalyst loads as low as 5&#8197;ppm than classical [CpPtMe3] in a typical test reaction of silicone elastomer fabrication. Our results demonstrate that traditional petrochemical based Cp metal chemistry and catalysis can be replaced, sometimes even outmatched by superior catalysts based on cheap building blocks from renewable feedstock.

         <title>Polar covalent apex&#8208;base bonding in borapyramidanes probed by solid&#8208;state NMR and DFT calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyramidane molecules have attracted chemists for many decades due to their regular shape, high symmetry and their correspondence in the macroscopic world. Recently, experimental access to a number of examples has been reported, in particular the rarely reported square pyramidal bora[4]pyramidanes. To describe the bonding situation of the nonclassical structure of pyramidanes, we present solid&#8208;state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) as a versatile tool for deciphering such bonding properties for three now accessible bora[4]pyramidane and dibora[5]pyramidane molecules. 11B solid&#8208;state NMR spectra indicate that the apical boron nuclei in these compounds are strongly shielded (around &#8208;50 ppm vs. BF3&#8208;Et2O complex) and possess quadrupolar coupling constants of less than 0.9 MHz pointing to a rather high local symmetry. 13C&#8208;11B spin&#8208;spin coupling constants have been explored as a measure of the bond covalency in the borapyramidanes. While the carbon&#8208;boron bond to the &#8211;B(C6F5)2 substituents of the base serves as an example for a classical covalent 2&#8208;center&#8208;2&#8208;electron (2c&#8208;2e) sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;sp2&#8208;boron &#963;&#8208;bond with 1J(13C&#8208;11B) coupling constants in the order of 75 Hz, those of the boron(apical)&#8208;carbon(basal) bonds in the pyramid are too small to measure. These results suggest that these bonds have a strongly ionic character, which is also supported by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking same&#8208;sign CPL: solvent effects on spectral form and racemisation kinetics in nine&#8208;coordinate chiral europium(III) complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the factors that shape the circularly polarised luminescence (CPL) emission profiles of europium(III)&#8208;based CPL emitters to have specific sign properties, e.g. monosignate individual CPL transitions, is key to design novel complexes for applications ranging from advanced security inks to bio&#8208;probes for live cell imaging. In order to correlate structure and spectral characteristics, a photophysical and kinetic investigation has been conducted on a series of coordinatively saturated nine&#8208;coordinate europium(III) systems based on 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane. 
We highlight that lanthanide emission is sensitive to changes in the ligand field by showing the linear dependence of total emission intensity ratios as a function of solvent polarity, for europium(III) complexes displaying an internal charge transfer (ICT) excited state. This sensitivity increases by a factor of 20 when studying changes in CPL spectra, rendering these complexes accurate probes of local polarity. Solvent polarity, solvent&#8208;specific effects, and the nature of the chromophores&#8217; coordinating donor atoms strongly influence the kinetic stability of europium(III) complexes with respect to enantiomer interconversion. Notably, we show that the choice of donor groups to coordinating to europium(III) and the nature and polarity of the solvent affects the rate of racemisation, leading to very long half&#8208;lives at room temperature in non&#8208;polar media.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling pH&#8208;Sensitive Chemical Reactions Pathways with Light &#8208; a Tale of Two Photobases: an Arrhenius and a Br&#248;nsted</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;gated chemical reactions allow spatial and temporal control of chemical processes. Here, we suggest a new system for controlling pH&#8208;sensitive processes with light using two photobases of Arrhenius and Br&#248;nsted types. Only after light excitation do Arrhenius photobases undergo hydroxide ion dissociation, while Br&#248;nsted photobases capture a proton. However, none can be used alone to reversibly control pH due to the limitations arising from excessively fast or overly slow photoreaction timescales. We show here that combining the two types of photobases allows light&#8208;triggered and reversible pH control. We show an application of this method in directing the pH&#8208;dependent reaction pathways of the organic dye Alizarin Red S simply by switching between different wavelengths of light, i.e., irradiating each photobase separately. The concept of a light&#8208;controlled system shown here of a sophisticated interplay between two photobases can be integrated into various smart functional and dynamic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Signal Transduction Allows Temporal Control of the Potential of a Concentration Cell Driven by the Decarboxylation of an Activated Carboxylic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of Activated Carboxylic Acids (ACAs) allows the time&#8208;controlled operation of dissipative chemical systems based on the acid&#8208;base reaction by providing both the stimulus that temporarily drives a physicochemical change and, subsequently, the counter&#8208;stimulus with a single reagent addition. However, their application is inherently limited to acid&#8208;sensitive systems. To overcome this limitation, we herein develop a straightforward device for the transduction of the acid&#8208;base stimuli delivered by an ACA into a voltage signal that, in turn, is used to control voltage&#8209;sensitive circuits that are not pH&#8209;responsive by themselves. The signal transductor can be easily assembled from common laboratory equipment and employs aqueous solutions of readily available chemicals. Furthermore, the operator can simply and intuitively tune the amplitude of the voltage signal, as well as its duration and offset by varying the concentration of the chemical species involved in the transduction process.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydroamination of Triisopropylsilyl Acetylene Sulfur Pentafluoride &#8208; a Bench&#8208;top Route to Pentafluorosulfanylated Enamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic access to a variety of aliphatic and vinylic pentafluorosulfanylated building blocks remains a major challenge in contemporary organofluorine chemistry hampering its investigation in the context of medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry and functional materials. Herein, we report a bench&#8208;top protocol to access the virtually unknown class of &#945;&#8208;SF5&#8208;enamines under mild reaction conditions in good to excellent yields (up to 95%). This reaction combines the protodesilylation of the commercially available precursor TASP with the in&#8208;situ hydroamination of HC&#8801;C&#8208;SF5. The on&#8208;site use of highly toxic gases or corrosive reagents is avoided, making access to this motif applicable to a wide chemical audience. The excellent E&#8208;diastereoselectivity of this two&#8208;step cascade reaction is suggested to be the result of the convergence of the fast Z&#8208;/E&#8208; isomerization of a vinyl anion as well as the isomerization of the iminium ion. The remarkable thermal stability of these SF5&#8208;enamines encourages further studies of their synthetic utility.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigating the Structure&#8208;property Relationships of Two Cd&#8208;based Hybrid Multifunctional Compounds with High Tc, Bright Fluorescence and Wide Band&#8208;gap</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid multifunctional materials have shown significant application in lighting and sensor fields, owing to their prominent performance and diversity structures. Herein, we synthesized two multifunctional compounds: (propyl&#8208;quinuclidone)2CdBr4 (1) and (F&#8208;butyl&#8208;quinuclidone)2CdBr4 (2). By introducing light&#8208;emitting organic cation with flexible long chain, 1 and 2 exhibit excellent transition properties and bright blue&#8208;white fluorescence. Then, combine fluorescence lifetime and first&#8208;principal calculation, providing evidence for the electron transfer emission. Subsequently, investigated the impact of substituent carbon chain length (methyl to butyl), structural rigidity (C&#8208;C to C&#8208;F) and halide framework (Cl to I) on the fluorescence properties. Results indicate that Cd&#183;&#183;&#183;Cd distance and structural rigidity play an important role in fluorescence. Overall, our research provides valuable insight and example for chemical modifications enhance compound performance.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In this concept, we showcase the upsurge in the studies of dynamic ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials containing inorganic and/or organic components as versatile photo&#8208;responsive platforms. The goal is to provide a comprehensive analysis of photo&#8208;controllable RTP, and meanwhile delve into the underlying RTP properties of various classes of photochromic materials including metal&#8211;organic complexes, organic&#8208;inorganic co&#8208;crystals, purely organic small molecules and organic polymers. In particular, the design principles governing the integration of the photochromic and RTP moieties within a single material system, and the tuning of dynamic RTP in response to light are emphasized. As such, this concept sheds light on the challenges and opportunities of using these tunable RTP materials for potential applications in optoelectronics, particularly highlighting their use of reversible information encryption, erasable light printing and rewritable smart paper.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescence color change of supramolecular polymer networks controlled by crown ether&#8208;cation recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a fluorescent supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs) system based on crown ether&#8208;cation recognition. The polymer side chains bear ammonium cations, which can be recognized by host molecules with a B15C5 unit and a quinoline group at each end. The quinoline group makes the host molecule exhibit blue fluorescence. After the formation of SPNs, the recognition of the crown ether&#8208;cation transforms the blue fluorescence into yellow fluorescence. The accompanying fluorescence color change during the formation of SPNs makes it with potential applications in the fields of display, printing, information storage, and bioimaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Construction of Ni(II)&#8208;Incorporated Covalent Organic Framework for Metallaphotoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of an all&#8208;in&#8208;one catalyst, in which the photosensitizer and the transition metal site are close to each other, is important for improving the efficiency of metallaphotoredox catalysis. However, the development of convenient synthetic strategies for the precise construction of an all&#8208;in&#8208;one catalyst remains a challenging task due to the requirement of precise installation of the catalytic sites. Herein, we have successfully established a facile bottom&#8208;up strategy for the direct synthesis of Ni(II)&#8208;incorporated covalent organic framework (COF), named LZU&#8208;713@Ni, as a versatile all&#8208;in&#8208;one metallaphotoredox catalyst. LZU&#8208;713@Ni showed excellent activity and recyclability in the photoredox/nickel&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;O, C&#8208;S, and C&#8208;P cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Notably, this catalyst displayed a better catalytic activity than its homogeneous analogues, physically mixed dual catalyst system, and, especially, LZU&#8208;713/Ni which was prepared through post&#8208;synthetic modification. The improved catalytic efficiency of LZU&#8208;713@Ni should be attributed to the implementation of bottom&#8208;up strategy, which incorporated the fixed, ordered, and abundant catalytic sites into its framework. This work sheds new light on the exploration of concise and effective strategies for the construction of multifunctional COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Radiolabelled&#160;177Lu&#8208;Bispidine&#8208;Trastuzumab for Targeting Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Positive Cancers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radioimmunotherapy (TRIT) is a promising alternative to conventional treatment options. Here,&#160;we present experimental work on the synthesis, radiochemistry, and&#160;in vivo&#160;performance of a lanthanide&#8208;selective nonadentate bispidine ligand suitable for&#160;177Lu3+&#160;ion complexation. The ligand (bisp,1) was derivatised with a photoactivatable aryl azide (ArN3) group as a bioconjugation handle for light&#8208;induced labelling of proteins. Quantitative radiosynthesis of [177Lu]Lu&#8208;1+&#160;was accomplished in 10 minutes at 40oC. Subsequent incubation [177Lu]Lu&#8208;1+&#160;with trastuzumab, followed by irradiation with light at 365 nm for 15 min, at room temperature and pH8.0&#8211;8.3, gave the radiolabelled mAb, [177Lu]Lu&#8208;1&#8208;azepin&#8208;trastuzumab ([177Lu]Lu&#8208;1&#8208;mAb) in a decay&#8208;corrected radiochemical yield of 14%, and radiochemical purity (RCP)&gt;90%. Stability studies and cellular binding assays&#160;in vitro&#160;using the SK&#8208;OV&#8208;3 human ovarian cancer cells confirmed that [177Lu]Lu&#8208;1&#8208;mAb remained biological active and displayed specific binding to HER2/neu. Experiments in immunocompromised female athymic nude mice bearing subcutaneous xenograft models of SK&#8208;OV&#8208;3 tumours revealed significantly higher tumour uptake in the normal group compared with the control block group (29.8&#177;11.4%ID g&#8208;1&#160;vs. 14.8&#177;6.1%ID g&#8208;1, respectively;&#160;P&#8208;value=0.037). The data indicate that bispidine&#8208;based ligand systems are suitable starting points for constructing novel, high&#8208;denticity chelators for specific complexation of larger radiotheranostic metal ion nuclides.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Novel Redox&#8208;Active Organic Materials Based on Benzimidazole, Benzoxazole, and Benzothiazole: A Combined Theoretical and Experimental Screening Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining theory and experiment allows the screening of new active materials. Electrochemical properties of the redox moieties can be predicted accurately. Out of three classes of molecule (benzo&#8208;thiazole, &#8208;oxazole, &#8208;imidazole), benzoxazoles exhibit the best electrochemical properties and can be further introduced into or onto a polymeric backbone, with the aim of being used in organic polymer batteries.







Abstract
Sustainability is one of the hot topics of today's research, in particular when it comes to energy&#8208;storage systems such as batteries. Redox&#8208;active molecules implemented in organic batteries represent a promising alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which partially rely on non&#8208;sustainable heavy metal salts. As an alternative, we propose benzothiazole, &#8208;oxazole and &#8208;imidazole derivatives as redox&#8208;active moieties for polymers in organic (radical) batteries. The target molecules were identified by a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches for the investigation of new organic active materials. Herein, we present the synthesis, electrochemical characterization and theoretical investigation of the proposed molecules, which can later be introduced into a polymer backbone and used in organic polymer batteries.

         <title>Remarkable Off&#8211;On Tunable Solid&#8208;State Luminescence by the Regulation of Pyrene Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8221; luminescent material: The pristine crystal of TFPA is almost non&#8208;emissive due to the ordered and long&#8208;range &#960; stacking. Upon grinding/UV irradiation, an obvious luminescence enhancement is observed owing to the formation of pyrene dimer structure. In addition, the &#8220;on&#8221; state can recover to &#8220;off&#8221; state under thermal annealing, showing good reversibility and applicability in intelligence material.







Abstract
It is always a challenge to achieve &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8221; luminescent switch by regulating non&#8208;covalent interactions. Herein, we report a unique strategy for constructing high performance &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8221; tunable luminescent materials utilizing a novel molecule (TFPA) consist of pyrene and cyanostilbene. The pristine crystal of TFPA is almost non&#8208;emissive. Upon grinding/UV irradiation, an obvious luminescence enhancement is observed. Theoretical and experimental results revealed the underlying mechanism of this intriguing &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8220; switching behavior. The non&#8208;emissive crystal consists of ordered H&#8208;aggregates, with adjacent two molecules stacked in an anti&#8208;parallel manner and no overlapped area in pyrene moieties. When external force is applied by grinding or internal force is introduced through the photoisomerization, the dimer structures are facilitated with shorter intermolecular distances and better overlapping of pyrene moieties. In addition, the &#8220;on&#8221; state can recover to &#8220;off&#8221; state under thermal annealing, showing good reversibility and applicability in intelligence material. The present results promote an in&#8208;depth insight between packing structure and photophysical property, and offer an effective strategy for the construction of luminescence &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8221; switching materials, toward the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescent materials for anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Are &#8220;Carbon Dots&#8221; Always Carbon Dots? Evidence for their Supramolecular Nature from Structural and Dynamic Studies in Solution and in the Pure Solid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A model unraveling the supramolecular nature of the so&#8208;called carbon dots (CDs) is proposed, in which small to medium&#8208;sized molecular species present in dilute solution dynamically assemble into supramolecular organized structures when highly concentrated or in the solid state. (HR&#8208;TEM: high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, PFG&#8208;NMR: pulsed field gradient&#8208;NMR, TRFA: time&#8208;resolved fluorescence anisotropy).







Abstract
A model for the morphology (size, shape, and crystallinity) of carbon dots (CDs) in the solid state consistent with the observed photoluminescence in solution is proposed herein. Overwhelming evidence has been collected that links the data coming from solid&#8208;state analysis (high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS)) to that of solution (pulsed&#8208;field gradient (PFG)&#8208;NMR spectroscopy, time&#8208;resolved fluorescence anisotropy (TRFA), and steady&#8208;state/time&#8208;resolved fluorescence), allowing the establishment of an overall structural model for CDs. According to this model, the so&#8208;called carbon dots, observed under HRTEM imaging, are in fact supramolecular organized structures dynamically assembled from small to medium&#8208;sized molecular species when the solvent is removed to give the solid form. In this way, the imaged nanoparticles (TEM/AFM) are not covalently bound entities formed during the synthetic process, but instead supramolecular entities formed by noncovalent interactions. These particles, if at all present in solution, have the form of loose associations of relatively small molecules. This study was conducted on CDs obtained from the hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of a biomass waste (olive wet pomace).

         <title>Access to NHC&#8211;Boryl Mono&#8208; and Bis&#8208;Selenide and Utility as Mild Selenium Transfer Reagent including to the C&#8722;F Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Access to NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;boryl mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;selenides from NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3 has been achieved. The boryl mono selenide has been demonstrated to function as a selenium transfer reagent, enabling the synthesis of selenoethers from benzyl bromide. Additionally, it can also facilitate the conversion of the challenging aromatic C&#8722;F bond to a C&#8722;Se bond, resulting in concomitant ring expansion of NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;haloborane.







Abstract
Reactions of 5&#8208;SIDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3 (5&#8208;SIDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) (1) with diphenyldiselenide provide access to 5&#8208;SIDipp&#8211;boryl mono&#8208; (5&#8208;SIDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2SePh) (2) and bis&#8208;selenide (5&#8208;SIDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH(SePh)2) (3). The facile cleavage of the B&#8722;Se bond makes 2 a neutral source of selenium nucleophiles in substitutions reactions with benzyl bromides, and provide access to the corresponding selenoethers. The direct transformations of one of the C(sp2)&#8722;F bonds of C5F5N and C6F5CF3 to C&#8722;Se bonds have also been achieved by the use of 2 without employing transition&#8208;metal catalysts. While it was previously established that C6F6 could undergo complete defluoroselenation under harsh conditions, we successfully achieved partial defluorination of C6F6 by employing 2 as a mild selenide transfer reagent. During the formation of C&#8722;Se bonds through the cleavage of C&#8722;F bonds, the potential by&#8208;product NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2F undergoes ring expansion of the NHC, leading to the formation of the six&#8208;membered diaazafluoroborinane (7).

         <title>Cyclic Azobenzene&#8208;BODIPY Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of cyclic hybrids of azobenzene and BODIPY 2B&#8211;8B were synthesized via Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reaction and following BF2 insertion. The structures of the representative hybrids were unambiguously revealed by single crystal diffraction analysis. The absorption spectra of the hybrids reveal the effective cyclic conjugation, and ultrafast measurements reveal that the photoexcited decays depend upon the ring size and connectivity.







Abstract
Cyclic azobenzene&#8208;BODIPY hybrids were synthesized via cyclization by 1) acid&#8208;catalysed condensation of azobenzene&#8208;bridged dipyrroles with 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzaldehyde, 2) oxidation with DDQ, and 3) metalation with BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O. The structures of many cyclic hybrids have been confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. The absorption spectra of the hybrids reveal the effective cyclic conjugation. The ultrafast measurements reveal that the photoexcited decays of these cyclic hybrids depend upon the ring size and connectivity.

         <title>Coordination Engineering of Heteronuclear Fe&#8722;Mo Dual&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Promoted Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation: A DFT Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of heteronuclear dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) denoted as FeMoN6&#8722;aXa (a=1, 2, 3; X=B, C, O, S) immobilized within the pores of g&#8208;C3N4 was designed by density functional theory computations, aiming to explore the nitrogen fixation activity of the Fe&#8722;Mo center and the influence of the coordination environment.







Abstract
Developing efficient nanostructured electrocatalysts for N2 reduction to NH3 under mild conditions remains a major challenge. The Fe&#8722;Mo cofactor serves as the archetypal active site in nitrogenase. Inspired by nitrogenase, we designed a series of heteronuclear dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) labeled as FeMoN6&#8722;aXa (a=1, 2, 3; X=B, C, O, S) anchored on the pore of g&#8208;C3N4 to probe the impact of coordination on FeMo&#8208;catalyzed nitrogen fixation. The stability, reaction paths, activity, and selectivity of 12 different FeMoN6&#8722;aXa DACs have been systematically studied using density functional theory. Of these, four DACs (FeMoN5B1, FeMoN5O1, FeMoN4O2, and FeMoN3C3) displayed promising nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) performance. Notably, FeMoN5O1 stands out with an ultralow limiting potential of &#8722;0.11&#8197;V and high selectivity. Analysis of the density of states and charge/spin changes shows FeMoN5O1&#8242;s high activity arises from optimal N2 binding on Fe initially and synergy of the FeMo dimer enabling protonation in NRR. This work contributes to the advancement of rational design for efficient NRR catalysts by regulating atomic coordination environments.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A set of heteronuclear dual-atom catalysts&lt;/b&gt; (DACs) denoted as FeMoN&lt;sub&gt;6&#8722;a&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; (a=1, 2, 3; X=B, C, O, S) immobilized within the pores of g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; was designed by density functional theory computations, aiming to explore the nitrogen fixation activity of the Fe&#8722;Mo center and the influence of the coordination environment.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing efficient nanostructured electrocatalysts for N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; under mild conditions remains a major challenge. The Fe&#8722;Mo cofactor serves as the archetypal active site in nitrogenase. Inspired by nitrogenase, we designed a series of heteronuclear dual-atom catalysts (DACs) labeled as FeMoN&lt;sub&gt;6&#8722;&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Supporting Electrolyte&#8208;Free Electrochemical Oxidative C&#8722;H Sulfonylation and Thiocyanation of Fused Pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;Ones in an All&#8208;Green Electrolytic System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical oxidative method for forming C&#8722;S bonds at the C3 position in fused pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones using sodium sulfinates and ammonium thiocyanate has been developed. This method does not require any of the additional reagents or hazardous solvents, such as supporting electrolytes, HFIP, additives, or catalysts.







Abstract
An electrooxidative C&#8722;H functionalization is a widely accepted route to obtain sulfur&#8208;containing arenes and heteroarenes. However, this process often involves using non&#8208;recyclable supporting electrolytes, (co)solvents like hexafluoroisopropanol, additives like acid, or catalysts. The use of additional reagents can increase costs and waste, reducing atom efficiency. Moreover, unlike other nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, there have only been sporadic reports of electrochemical C&#8722;H functionalization in fused pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones, and an electrolyte&#8208;free process has yet to be developed. This work demonstrates that such anodic coupling reactions can be performed in an all&#8208;green electrolytic system without using such additional electrolytes or HFIP, maintaining a high atom economy. This C&#8722;H functionalization strategy utilizes inexpensive sodium sulfinates and ammonium thiocyanate as sulfonylating and thiocyanating agents in an undivided cell at a constant current, using a mixture of CH3CN/H2O as solvent at room temperature. Thus, fused pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones can be selectively converted into C3&#8208;sulfonylated and &#8208;thiocyanated derivatives in moderate to good yields.

         <title>Understanding the Poly (Triazine Imide) Crystals Formation Process: The Conversion from Heptazine to Triazine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium chloride is a decisive factor in converting heptazine&#8208;based Bulk g&#8208;C3N4 into triazine&#8208;based PTI, thereby leads to a drastic change in physicochemical properties and achieves photocatalytic overall water splitting.







Abstract
Poly (triazine imide) (PTI) generally obtained via ionothermal synthesis features extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and enhanced crystallinity. However, in&#8208;depth investigation of the polycondensation process for PTI is an onerous task due to multiple influencing factors and limited characterization techniques. Herein, to simplify the polymerization route and exclude non&#8208;essential factors, PTI was prepared by calcining only melamine and LiCl. This study aims to identify the pivotal role of LiCl in PTI formation, which can convert heptazine&#8208;based intermediates into more stable triazine&#8208;based PTI framework. Based on this discovery, we demonstrate the transformation process of the prepared samples from amorphous Bulk g&#8208;C3N4 to regular PTI, and further prove that the reaction with LiCl causes disruption of heptazine covalent organic frameworks. Additionally, the PTI exhibits higher photocatalytic water splitting performance due to efficient charge carrier mobility and separation, as well as faster reaction kinetics. This discovery deepens understanding of the polycondensation process of PTI crystals and provides insights toward the rational design of crystalline carbon nitride&#8208;based semiconductors.

         <title>The impact of stoichiometry on the initial steps of crystal formation: Stability and lifetime of charged triple&#8208;ion complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Minerals form in nature from solutions with varying ratios of their lattice ions, yet non&#8208;stoichiometric conditions have generally been overlooked in investigations of new formation (nucleation) of ionic crystals. Here, we investigated the influence of cation:anion&#8208;ratio in the solution on the initial steps of nucleation by studying positively and negatively charged triple ion complexes and subsequent particle size evolution. Our model systems are carbonates and sulfates of calcium and barium, as it was recently shown that solution stoichiometry affects the timing and rate of their nucleation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and dynamic light scattering (DLS) flow experiments show that nucleation correlates with the stability and lifetime of the initial complexes, which were significantly impacted by the cation:anion stoichiometry and ion type. Specifically, Ba(SO4)22&#8208; had higher association constants and its lifetime was twofold longer than Ba2SO42+. Similar trends were observed for BaCO3 and CaSO4. Contrastingly, for CaCO3, Ca(CO3)22&#8208; had lower association constants and its lifetime was shorter than Ca2CO32+. These trends in stability and lifetime follow the same asymmetrical behaviour as observed experimentally for particle formation using techniques like DLS. This suggests a causal relationship between the stability and lifetime of the initial charged complexes and the nucleation under non&#8208;stoichiometric conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Azotriptycenes: Photoswitchable Molecular Brakes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work azotriptycenes are presented as light&#8208;controlled molecular brakes. Their mechanism of motion and changed kinetics upon isomerization are studied by theory and variable temperature NMR spectroscopy. With azotriptycenes C&#8722;N bond rotation rates can be decelerated or accelerated reversibly by up to five orders of magnitude.







Abstract
The control of molecular motions is a central topic of molecular machine research. Molecular brakes are fundamental building blocks towards such goal as they allow deliberately decelerating specific motions after an outside stimulus is applied. Here we present azotriptycenes as structural framework for light&#8208;controlled molecular brakes. The intrinsic kinetics and their changes upon azotriptycene isomerization are scrutinized comprehensively by a mixed theoretical and variable temperature NMR approach. With azotriptycenes C&#8722;N bond rotation rates can be decelerated or accelerated reversibly by up to five orders of magnitude. Rate change effects are highly localized and are strongest for the C&#8722;N bond connecting a triptycene rotor fragment to the central diazo group. The detailed mechanistic insights provide a solid basis for further conscious design and applications in the future.

Ester&#8208;substituted [3]radialene radical anions dimerize in solutions of water. The dimerization mode is structure specific and can be controlled by using heat, solvent, and salt. These results provide guidance for increasing the capacity of aqueous redox flow batteries containing radialene catholytes. A buildup of &#963;&#8208;dimer prevents stable charge&#8211;discharge cycling. The formation of &#960;&#8208;dimers through the addition of salt increases the stability of the charged species.







Abstract
The hexacyano[3]radialene radical anion (1) is an attractive catholyte material for use in redox flow battery (RFB) applications. The substitution of cyano groups with ester moieties enhances solubility while maintaining redox reversibility and favorable redox potentials. Here we show that these ester&#8208;functionalized, hexasubstituted [3]radialene radical anions dimerize reversibly in water. The dimerization mode is dependent on the substitution pattern and can be switched in solution. Stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior is achieved by exploiting an unprecedented tristate switching mechanism, wherein the radical can be toggled between the free radical, a &#960;&#8208;dimer, and a &#963;&#8208;dimer&#8208;each with dramatically different optical, magnetic, and redox properties&#8208;by changing the solvent environment, temperature, or salinity. The symmetric, triester&#8208;tricyano[3]radialene (3) forms a solvent&#8208;responsive, &#963;&#8208;dimer in water that converts to the radical anion with the addition of organic solvents or to a &#960;&#8208;dimer in brine solutions. Diester&#8208;tetracyano[3]radialene (2) exists primarily as a &#960;&#8208;dimer in aqueous solutions and a radical anion in organic solvents. The dimerization behavior of both 2 and 3 is temperature dependent in methanol solutions. Dimerization equilibrium has a direct impact on catholyte stability during galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge cycling in static H&#8208;cells. Specifically, conditions that favor the free radical anion or &#960;&#8208;dimer exhibit significantly enhanced cycling profiles.

         <title>10&#8197;&#956;m&#8208;Level TiNb2O7 Secondary Particles for Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Fast charging: 10&#8197;&#956;m&#8208;level TiNb2O7 secondary particle consisting of initial 1&#8211;2&#8197;&#956;m TiNb2O7 active particle with high crystallinity was successfully fabricated. The small number of particle&#8208;stacking layers with high conductivity could reduce the large inter&#8208;particle resistance within the electrode, which enabled the outstanding fast&#8208;charging performance of 5&#8197;Ah&#8208;level full cells.







Abstract
TiNb2O7 with Wadsley&#8211;Roth phase delivers double theoretical specific capacity and similar working potential in comparison to spinel Li4Ti5O12, the commercial high&#8208;rate anode material, and thus can enable much higher energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the inter&#8208;particle resistance within the high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading TiNb2O7 electrode would impede the capacity release for practical application, especially under fast&#8208;charging conditions. Herein, 10&#8211;20&#8197;&#956;m&#8208;size carbon&#8208;coated TiNb2O7 secondary particle (SP&#8208;TiNb2O7) consisting of initial micro&#8208;scale TiNb2O7 particles (MP&#8208;TiNb2O7) was fabricated. The high crystallinity of active material could enable fast&#8208;charge diffusion and electrochemical reaction rate within particles, and the small number of stacking layers of SP&#8208;TiNb2O7 could reduce the large inter&#8208;particle resistance that regular particle electrode often possess and achieve high compaction density of electrodes with high mass loading. The investigation on materials structure and electrochemical reaction kinetics verified the advances of the as&#8208;fabricated SP&#8208;TiNb2O7 in achieving superior electrochemical performance. The SP&#8208;TiNb2O7 exhibited high reversible capacity of 292.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 in the potential range of 1&#8211;3&#8197;V (Li+/Li) at 0.1&#8197;C, delivering high&#8208;capacity release of 94.3&#8201;%, and high capacity retention of 86&#8201;% at 0.5&#8197;C for 250&#8197;cycles in half cell configuration. Particularly, the advances of such an anode were verified in practical 5&#8197;Ah&#8208;level laminated full pouch cell. The as&#8208;assembled LiFePO4||TiNb2O7 full cell exhibited a high capacity of 5.08&#8197;Ah at high charging rate of 6&#8197;C (77.9&#8201;% of that at 0.2&#8197;C of 6.52&#8197;Ah), as well as an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.0352&#8201;% for 250&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C, suggesting the great potential for practical fast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Cyclometalatedgold(III)&#8208;hydride under oriented external electric fields: a new strategy to modulate its reactivity?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selected gold complexes have been regarded as promising anti&#8208;cancer agents because they can bind with protein targets containing thiol or selenol moieties, but their clinical applications were hindered by the unbiased binding towards off&#8208;target thiol&#8208;proteins. Recently, a novel gold(III)&#8208;hydride complex (abbreviated as 1) with visible light&#8208;induced thiol reactivity has been reported as potent photo&#8208;activated anticancer agents (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 2020, 132, 11139). To explore new strategies to stimuli this potential antitumor drug, the effect of oriented external electric fields (OEEFs) on its geometric structure, electronic properties, and chemical reactivity was systematically investigated. Results reveal that imposing external electric fields along the Au&#8208;H bond of 1 can effectively activate this bond, which is conducive to its dissociation and the binding of Au site to potential targets. Hence, this study provides a new OEEF&#8208;strategy to activate this reported gold(III)&#8208;hydride, revealing its potential application in electrochemical therapy. We anticipate this work could promote the development of more electric field&#8208;activated anticancer agents. However, further experimental research should be conducted to verify the conclusions obtained in this work.</dc:description>

         <title>Creating Efficient Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials with Cyano&#8208;Substituted 11,12&#8208;Diphenyldipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2',3'&#8208;c]phenazine Acceptors</title>

         <dc:description>Red luminescent materials are essential components for full color display and white lightening based on organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) technology, but the extension of emission color towards red or deep red region generally leads to decreased photoluminescence and electroluminescence efficiencies. Herein, we wish to report two new luminescent molecules (2CNDPBPPr&#8208;TPA and 4CNDPBPPr&#8208;TPA) consisting of cyano&#8208;substituted 11,12&#8208;diphenyldipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2',3'&#8208;c]phenazine acceptors and triphenylamine donors. As the increase of cyano substituents, the emission wavelength is greatly red&#8208;shifted and the reverse intersystem crossing process is promoted, resulting in strong red delayed fluorescence. Meanwhile, due to the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, the molecular structures become rigidified and planarized, which brings about large horizontal dipole ratios. As a result, 2CNDPBPPr&#8208;TPA and 4CNDPBPPr&#8208;TPA can perform as emitters efficiently in OLEDs, furnishing excellent external quantum efficiencies of 28.8% at 616 nm and 20.4% at 648 nm, which are significantly improved in comparison with that of the control molecule without cyano substituents. The findings in this work demonstrate that the introduction of cyano substituents to the acceptors of delayed fluorescence molecules could be a facile and effective approach to explore high&#8208;efficiency red or deep red delayed fluorescence materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Scalable [3+2] cycloaddition of alkynyl boronates and in situ generated unstabilized azomethine ylide is reported for the first time. The selective formation of either 1:1 or 1:2 cycloaddition products was achieved by carefully optimizing the reaction conditions, mainly by controlling the reactant stoichiometry, catalyst loading, and internal temperature. The developed protocol tolerated many valuable functional groups, including TMS, protected alcohol (as ether or THP derivatives), or aldehyde (as acetal). Further common C&#8211;C and C &#8211; heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions, as well as scaled&#8208;up procedures demonstrate the utility of the prepared compounds as building blocks for organic synthesis and drug discovery.</dc:description>

Further common C&#8211;C and C &#8211; heteroatom bond-forming reactions, as well as scaled-up procedures demonstrate the utility of the prepared compounds as building blocks for organic synthesis and drug discovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Targeting the Antifungal Activity of Carbon Dots against Candida albicans&#160;Biofilm Formation by Tailoring Their Surface Functional Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dots (CDs) are an emerging class of carbon nanoparticles, which for their characteristics have found applications in many fields such as catalysis, materials and biomedicine. Within this context, the application of CDs as antibacterial agents has received much attention in very recent years, while their use as antifungal nanoparticles has been scarcely investigated. Here we report a systematic investigation of the surface functional groups of CDs to study their influence on these nanoparticles&#8217; against Candida albicans. Three classes of CDs have been synthesised and fully characterized. A thorough in vitro and in vivo biological screening against C. albicans was performed to test their antifungal, antiadhesion and antibiofilm formation activities. Moreover, the interaction with C. albicans cells was investigated by microscopic analysis. Our results evidence how the presence of a positively polarised surface results crucial for the internalization into COS&#8208;7 cells. Positively charged nanoparticles were also able to inhibit adhesion and biofilm formation, to interact with the cellular membrane of C. albicans, and to increase the survival of G. mellonella infected larvae after the injection with positive nanoparticles. The antifungal activity of CDs and their extremely low toxicity may represent a new strategy to combat infections sustained by C.albicans.</dc:description>

         <title>Scaffold Editing of Cubanes into Homocubanes; Homocuneanes via Cuneanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective synthesis of cage&#8208;type hydrocarbons through the editing of the highly symmetric molecule cubane can be anticipated as one of the efficient approaches. In this paper, we identify a catalyst that facilitates the efficient scaffold isomerization of cubanes into homocubanes. This approach, which involves the direct synthesis of homocubanol esters, is promising as a novel method for the synthesis of phenoxy bioisosteres. Additionally, we observed that the isomerization of 1,4&#8208;diacyloxymethylcubane results in the generation of both D2&#8208; and C2&#8208;symmetrical bishomocubanes. The same catalyst was also applied to the isomerization of acyloxymethylcuneanes, producing homocuneanol esters.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Alkyl&#8208;Locked Axial Chirality Scaffold by Restriction of Molecular Motions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boosting the circularly polarized luminescence of small organic molecules has been a stubborn challenge because of weak structure rigidity and dynamic molecular motions. To investigate and eliminate these factors, here, we carried out the structure&#8208;property relationship studies on a newly&#8208;developed axial chiral scaffold of bidibenzo[b,d]furan. The molecular rigidity was finely tuned by gradually reducing the alkyl&#8208;chain length. The environmental factors were considered in solution, crystal, and polymer matrix at different temperatures. As a result, a significant amplification of the dissymmetry factor glum from 10&#8208;4 to 10&#8208;1 was achieved, corresponding to the situation from (R)&#8208;4C in solution to (R)&#8208;1C in polymer film at room temperature. A synergistic strategy of increasing the intramolecular rigidity and enhancing the intermolecular interaction to restrict the molecular motions was thus proposed to improve circularly polarized luminescence. The though&#8208;out demonstrated relationship will be of great importance for the development of high&#8208;performance small organic chiroptical systems in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Responsive Polyoxometalate@Metal&#8722;Organic Frameworks Involving Ir Metalloligands for Highly Selective Photocatalytic Oxidation of Sulfides to Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of highly efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive photocatalysts is fundamental to solving the problems of low efficiency and poor selectivity in photocatalytic organic synthesis reactions. We synthesized a crystalline polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based metal&#8722;organic framework material {Zn4(H2O)8[Ir(ppy)2(dcbpy)]4[SiW12O40]}&#183;4H2O (Ir&#8208;SiW) by self&#8208;assembly of Ir metalloligands with POMs. The introduction of Ir metalloligands extends the light absorbing range to visible light, improving the efficient utilization of solar energy. The transfer of photogenerated electrons from Ir metalloligands to SiW12 was observed under visible light irradiation, which boosted the carrier separation efficiency. The synergistic effect of the two components increased the photocatalytic thioether oxidation activity, and the product methyl phenyl sulfoxide for 2.5h under visible light irradiation (&#955; &gt; 400 nm) reached 99.5%, which was higher than those of other POM&#8208;based photocatalysts. Meanwhile, the yield of methyl phenyl sulfoxide was still higher than 97% after three cycles, demonstrating the high stability and reusability of Ir&#8208;SiW.</dc:description>

         <title>A pseudo&#8208;Double&#8208;Network Hydrogel Built upon Layered Double Hydroxides with Self&#8208;Strengthening Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While great achievements have been made in the development of mechanically robust nanocomposite hydrogels, incorporating multiple interactions on the bases of two demensional inorganic cross&#8208;linkers to construct self&#8208;strengthening hydrogels has rarely been investigated. To this end, we propose here a new method for the coupling the dynamic covalent bonds and non&#8208;covalent interactions within a pseudo double&#8208;network system. The pseudo first network, formed through the Schiff Base reation between Tris&#8208;modified layered double hydroxides (Tris&#8208;LDHs) and oxidized dextran (ODex), is linked to the second network built upon non&#8208;covalent interactions between Tris&#8208;LDHs and poly(acrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;2&#8208;acrylamido&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;propanesulfonate) (p&#8208;(AM&#8208;co&#8208;AMPS). The swelling and mechanical properties of the resulting hydrogels have been investigated as a function of the ODex and AMPS contents. The as&#8208;prepared hydrogel can swell to 420 times of its original size and retain more than 99.9 wt.% of water. Mechanical tests show that the hydrogel can bear 90 % of compression and is able to be stretched to near 30 times of its original length. Cyclic tensile tests reveal that the hydrogels are capable of self&#8208;recovery and self&#8208;strengthening after mechanical training. The unique energy dissipation mechanism based on the dynamic covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions is considered to be responsible for the outstanding swelling and mechanical performances.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the Cu(II) catalyzed synthesis of &#946;&#8208;disubstituted ketones from styrene via oxo&#8208;alkylation with unactivated cycloalkanes as the alkylating agent in presence of tert&#8208;butylhydroperoxide (TBHP) and 1&#8208;methylimidazole as oxidant and base respectively. &#946;&#8208;disubstituted ketones are known to be synthesized by using either expensive Ru/Ir complexes, or low&#8208;cost metal complexes (e.g., Fe, Mn) with activated species like aldehyde, acid, alcohol, or phthalimide derivatives as the alkylating agent, however, use of unactivated cycloalkanes directly as the alkylating agent remains challenging. A wide range of aliphatic C&#8722;H substrates as well as various olefinic arenes and heteroarene (35 substrates including 14 new substrates) are well&#8208;tolerated in this method. Hammett analysis shed more light on the substitution effect in the olefinic part on the overall mechanism. Furthermore, the controlled experiments, kinetic isotope effect study, and theoretical calculations (DFT) enable us to gain deeper insight of mechanistic intricacies of this new simple and atom&#8208;economic methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>Intermolecular 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition Reaction of N&#8208;Carbamoyl Nitrones Generated by N&#8208;Selective Carbamoylation of Oximes with Isocyanates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: N&#8208;Selective carbamoylation reaction of oximes with isocyanates generates nitrones, which undergo 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition with various dipolarophiles to afford diverse isoxazolidines. Notably, combinations of highly electron&#8208;rich oxime and highly electron&#8208;deficient dipolarophile exhibited high reactivity, with product yields of up to 94%. The substituent on the isoxazolidine&#8208;nitrogen atom could be successfully removed without loss of the cyclic structure. Computational studies have also elucidated the mechanism of the reaction and origin of stereoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trifluoromethyl group&#160;relishes a privileged position in the realm of medicinal chemistry because its incorporation into organic molecules often enhances the bioactivity by altering pharmacological profile of molecule. Trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;dicarbonyls have emerged as pivotal building blocks in synthetic organic chemistry due to their facile accessibility, stability and remarkable versatility. Owing to presence of nucleophilic and electrophilic&#160;sites, they offer multifunctional sites for the reaction. This review covers a meticulous exploration of their multifaceted role, encompassing an in&#8208;depth analysis of mechanism, extensive scope, limitations and wide&#8208;ranging applications in diverse organic synthesis, covering the literature from the 21st century. This comprehensive review encapsulates the applications of trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;dicarbonyls and their synthetic equivalents as precursors of complex and diverse heterocyclic scaffolds, fused heterocycles and spirocyclic compounds having medicinal and material importance. Their potent synthetic utility in cyclocondenation reactions with binucleophiles, cycloaddition reactions, C&#8208;C bond formations, asymmetric multicomponent reactions using classical/solvent&#8208;free/catalytic synthesis have been presented. Influence of unsymmetrical trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;diketones on regioselectivity of transformation is also reviewed. This review will benefit the synthetic and pharmaceutical communities to explore trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;dicarbonyls as trifluoromethyl building blocks for fabrication of heterocyclic scaffolds having implementation into drug discovery programs in the imminent future.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Efficient Polymeric Binders for Transition Metal Oxides&#8208;based Li&#8208;ion Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal oxide cathodes&#160;(TMOCs) such as LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 and LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 have been widely employed in Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) owing to superior operating voltages, high reversible capacities and relatively low cost. Nevertheless, despite significant advancements in practical application, TMOC&#8208;based LIBs face great challenges such as transition metal dissolution and volume expansion during cycling, which jeopardizes the future advance of high&#8208;voltage TMOCs. As a critical component of cathode, polymeric binder acts as a crucial part in maintaining the mechanical and ion/electron conductive integrity between active particles, carbon additives, and the aluminum collector, hence minimizing cathode pulverization during battery cycling. Moreover, Polymeric binder with specialized functions is thought to offer a new solution to enhancing the electrochemical stability of the TMOCs. Therefore, this review aims at providing a comprehensive summary of the ideal requirements, design strategies and recent progress of polymeric binders for TMOCs. Future design perspectives and promising research technologies for advanced binders for high&#8208;voltage TMOCs are introduced.</dc:description>

         <title>Cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;mediated Histidine Dimerization Exploring the Structure and Binding Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cucurbit[7,8]urils are known to form inclusion complexes with hydrophobic amino acids such as Trp, Tyr, Phe, and Met, as well as peptides containing these residues at the N&#8208;terminus. Despite their widespread use in protein purification, the affinity of histidine (His) for cucurbit[7,8]urils has not been extensively explored. In this study, X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments were conducted to investigate the binding of two histidine moieties to the cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) cavity, resulting in a network of &#960;&#8208;&#960; and hydrogen bonds. This assembly was found to induce a His pKa shift of &#916;pKa=&#8208;4. Histidine weakly bound to CB7 or CB8; however, isothermal titration calorimetry revealed micromolar equilibrium dissociation constant values for CB7 and CB8 when bound to dipeptides containing His at the C&#8208;terminus. Conversely, dipeptides with His at the N&#8208;terminus exhibited millimolar values. Additionally, the His&#8208;Gly&#8208;Gly tripeptide formed a 2:1 complex with CB7. These findings suggest the potential use of histidine and histidine&#8208;containing tags in conjunction with CB7 for various biological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Powerful P&#8211;N Connection: Preparative Approaches, Reactivity, and Applications of P&#8208;Stereogenic Aminophosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For more than five decades, P&#8208;stereogenic aminophosphine chalcogenides and boranes have attracted scientific attention and are still in the focus of ongoing research. In the last years, novel transition metal&#8208;based synthesis methods have been discovered, in addition to the long&#8208;known use of chiral auxiliaries. Enantiomerically pure compounds with N&#8211;P+&#8211;X&#8208; (X&#160;=&#160;O,&#160;S,&#160;BH3) motifs served as valuable reactive building blocks to provide new classes of organophosphorus derivatives, thereby preserving the stereochemical information at the phosphorus atom. Over the years, intriguing applications in organocatalysis and transition metal catalysis have been reported for some representatives. Asymmetric reductions of C&#9552;C, C&#9552;N, and C&#9552;O double bonds were feasible with selected P&#8208;stereogenic aminophosphine oxides in the presence of hydrogen transfer reagents. P&#8208;stereogenic aminophosphine boranes could be easily deprotected and used as ligands for various transition metals to enable catalytic asymmetric hydrogenations of olefins and imines. This review traces the emergence of a synthetically and catalytically powerful functional compound class with phosphorus&#8208;centered chirality in its main lines, starting from classical approaches to modern synthesis methods to current applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalently&#8208;linked chromophore&#8211;radical systems with their unique optical and magnetic properties are useful for applications in, e.g., quantum information science. To expand the catalog of molecular systems, we synthesized and characterized six novel chromophore&#8211;radical and radical&#8211;chromophore&#8211;radical systems employing derivatives of perylene diimide (PDI) as the chromophore and trityl as the radical. The EPR properties of these compounds were evaluated in solution at cryogenic and room temperatures. In addition, the electron spin&#8208;spin coupling in the two bistrityl systems was investigated using DQC measurements.

         <title>Two Allogons of an O2&#8208;activating Bis(disiloxido)ferrate(II) Accessible Selectively just by Variation of the Crystallization Temperature</title>

         <dc:description>Deprotonation of O(iPr2SiOH)2 (iPrLH2) with LiOtBu followed by reaction with FeCl2 in THF led to the complex [iPrL2Fe][Li(THF)2]2, 2, which represents a structural and spectroscopic model of the &#945;&#8208;Fe sites of Fe/ZSM&#8208;5. Reaction with O2 in THF solution proceeds rather fast and is complete within 200 ms; an intermediate O2 adduct could not be identified by stopped&#8208;flow methods. Cooling blue solutions of 2 to &#8722;80&#176;C led to the growth of blue crystals of 2.THF, the analysis of which by XRD revealed a FeO4 core that is somewhat distorted from planarity towards a tetrahedral structure. By contrast, cooling such solutions to &#8722;30&#176;C led to pink crystals of an allogon featuring a perfectly square planar FeO4 entity. Hence, 2 represents a unique case where two different structural isomers (allogons) can be crystallized from the same solvent selectively, controlled by the temperature. DFT calculations were performed to understand this finding.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>While smaller polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes TnRn (POSS) are readily accessible or even commercially available, unambiguously authenticated larger systems (n &gt; 12) have barely been reported. Synthesis and isolation procedures are lengthy, and yields are often very low. Herein, we present the surprisingly straightforward and high&#8208;yielding access to the phenyl&#8208;substituted derivative of a so far only postulated second D3h&#8208;symmetric T14 isomer and with that the largest crystallographically characterized POSS cage with organic substituents. Treatment of the commercially available incompletely condensed T7Ph7(OH)3 silsesquioxane with catalytic amounts of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid results in high yields of the T14Ph14 framework, which is isolated in crystalline form by a simple work&#8208;up. D3h&#8208;T14Ph14 was analyzed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and thermal analysis. The relative energies of all four theoretically possible T14Ph14 isomers were determined by optimization of the corresponding structure using DFT methods.</dc:description>

         <title>The impact of ortho&#8208;substituents on Bonding in Silver(I) and Halogen(I) complexes of 2&#8208;Mono&#8208; and 2,6&#8208;Disubstituted Pyridines: An In&#8208;depth Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>

         <dc:description>The coordination nature of 2&#8208;mono&#8208; and 2,6&#8208;disubstituted pyridines with electron&#8208;withdrawing halogen and electron&#8208;donating methyl groups for [N&#8211;X&#8211;N]&#8314; (X =I, Br) complexations have been studied using 15N NMR, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The 15N NMR chemical shifts reveal iodine(I) and bromine(I) prefer to form complexes with 2&#8208;substituted pyridines and only 2,6&#8208;dimethylpyridine. The crystalline halogen(I) complexes of 2&#8208;substituted pyridines were characterized by using X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, but 2,6&#8208;dihalopyridines were unable to form stable crystalline halogen(I) complexes due to the lower nucleophilicity of the pyridinic nitrogen. In contrast, the halogen(I) complexes of 2,6&#8208;dimethylpyridine, which has a more basic nitrogen, are characterized by X&#8208;crystallography, which complements the 15N NMR studies. DFT calculations reveal that the bond energies for iodine(I) complexes vary between &#8208;291 and &#8208;351 kJmol&#8208;1 and for bromine between &#8208;370 and &#8208;427 kJmol&#8208;1. The bond energies of halogen(I) complexes of 2&#8208;halopyridines with more nucleophilic nitrogen are 66 &#8208; 76 kJmol&#8208;1 larger than those of analogous 2,6&#8208;dihalopyridines with less nucleophilic nitrogen. The experimental and DFT results show that the electronic influence of ortho&#8208;halogen substituents on pyridinic nitrogen leads to a completely different preference for the coordination bonding of halogen(I) ions, providing new insights into bonding in halogen(I) chemistry.</dc:description>

When reacted with disulfide and diselenide, the S&#8210;S and Se&#8210;Se bonds were cleaved, and a coupled product was formed through carbon atom of the pyridine&#8208;imine group.

         <title>Application of MXene&#8208;based materials for cathode in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries have a high theoretical specific capacity of 1675 mAh&#183;g&#8208;1 and become the most promising high energy storage system in the future. However, their applications are hindered by insulated feature and volume expansion of sulfur, as well as the &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; of polysulfides. MXenes own metallic conductivity and strong ability of polysulfides adsorption. Besides, their unique two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structure, large specific surface area, abundant functional groups and adjustability are beneficial to overcome the drawbacks of sulfur cathode. In this review, different mainstream preparation methods and excellent properties of MXenes are summarized. Important achievements and recent progress of MXene&#8208;based cathodes and interlayers applied to cathodes are concluded later. Finally, there are also provided the difficulties and potential uses of MXenes for Li&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>A Proof&#8208;of&#8208;Concept Study on the Theranostic Potential of 177Lu&#8208;labeled Biocompatible Covalent Polymer Nanoparticles for Cancer Targeted Radionuclide Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Theranostic nanomedicine combined bioimaging and therapy probably rises more helpful and interesting opportunities for personalized medicine. In this work, 177Lu radiolabeling and surface PEGylation of biocompatible covalent polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) have generated a new theranostic nanoformulation &#160;for targeted diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. The in vitro anticancer investigations demonstrate that 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs possess excellent bonding capacity with breast cancer cells (4T1), inhibiting the cell viability, leading to cell apoptosis, arresting the cell cycle, and upregulating the reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can be attributed to the good targeting ability of the nanocarrier and the strong relative biological effect of the radionuclide labelled compound. Single photon emission computed tomography/ computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging and in vivo biodistribution based on 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs reveal that notable radioactivity accumulation at tumor site in murine 4T1 models with both intravenous and intratumoral administration of the prepared radiotracer. Significant tumor inhibition has been observed in mice treated with 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs, of which the median survival was highly extended. More strikingly, 50% of mice intratumorally injected with 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs was cured and showed no tumor recurrence within 90 days. The outcome of this work can provide new hints for traditional nanomedicines and promote clinical translation of 177Lu radiolabeled compounds efficiently.</dc:description>

         <title>Separator Design Strategies to Advance Rechargeable Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the increasing demand for low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;safety portable batteries, aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have been regarded as a potential alternative to the lithium&#8208;ion batteries, bringing about extensive research dedicated in the exploration of high&#8208;performance and highly reversible ZIBs. Although separators are generally considered as non&#8208;active components in conventional research on ZIBs, advanced separators designs seem to offer effective solutions to the majority of issues within ZIBs system. These issues encompass concerns related to the zinc anode, cathode, and electrolyte.&#160; Initially, we delve into the origins and implications of various inherent problems within the ZIBs system. Subsequently, we present the latest research advancements in addressing these challenges through separators engineering. This includes a comprehensive, detailed exploration of various strategies, coupled with instances of advanced characterizations to provide a more profound insight into the mechanisms that influence the separators. Finally, we undertake a multi&#8208;criteria evaluation, based on application standards for diverse substrate separators, while proposing guiding principles for the optimal design of separators in zinc batteries. This review aims to furnish valuable guidance for the future development of advanced separators, thereby nurturing progress in the field of ZIBs.</dc:description>
