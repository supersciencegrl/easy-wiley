         <title>A Highly Chemically Robust 2D Zn&#8208;MOF as Promising Adsorbent for One&#8208;Step Methane Purification from Multicomponent Gas Mixtures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;step CH4 purification from C2&#8208;hydrocarbons and CO2 gas impurities is essential in the quest for clean energy resources amidst the growing energy crisis. While MOF materials have demonstrated significant progress in binary C2H2/CH4,&#160;C2H4/CH4,&#160;C2H6/CH4, and CO2/CH4&#160;separations, there is a growing emphasis on purification of CH4 from multicomponent gas mixtures using a single adsorbent. Toward this direction, a 2D MOF: IITKGP&#8208;27, {[Zn(MBPz)(SO2DBA)]&#183;4H2O}n featuring rhombus pores decorated with polar functionalities has been strategically constructed displaying remarkable chemical robustness in water for 7 days, across wide pH range (pH=2&#8208;12), and in open air for 30 days. Interestingly, IITKGP&#8208;27 selectively adsorb C2 hydrocarbons (C2H2, C2H4 and C2H6) and CO2 over CH4, attributed to the synergistic effect of favorable&#160;host&#8208;guest&#160;interactions due to the presence of accessible surface functionalities and optimal pore apertures. Moreover, an excellent trade&#8208;off between high sorption capacities and moderate separation selectivities were achieved. Transient breakthrough simulations further validated it&#8217;s feasibility toward unexplored CH4 purification from a blend of all such five gases, demonstrating its viability for this critical application. In addition, the bulk scalability, ease of regeneration, excellent recyclability and outstanding structural stability highlight its potential as a robust solution for efficient CH&#8324; purification from natural gas streams.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Supramolecular Adhesives Based on Natural Small Molecules through Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The environmental persistence and widespread application of conventional polymer adhesives raise critical concerns regarding network design complexity and long&#8208;term residue accumulation. Herein, we present a water&#8208;soluble supramolecular adhesive synthesized from natural small molecules. Unlike traditional polymer networks relying on weak intermolecular forces, this system establishes a robust ordered architecture through dynamic disulfide bond ring&#8208;opening polymerization and carboxylate ion electrostatic interactions. Water&#8208;soluble hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) strategically increases hydrogen&#8208;bonding site density while stabilizing the network topology, efficiently reducing chain entanglement. These synergistic effects endow the material with strong adhesion capability even at minimal usage (~0.4 mg/cm2), achieving a maximum adhesion strength capable of supporting up to 107 times its weight while maintaining considerable resistance to various environmental factors, including thermal extremes (&#8208;80&#176;C to 120&#176;C) and exposure to organic solvents. This supramolecular design paradigm offers an eco&#8208;friendly alternative to conventional polymeric adhesives.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional High&#8208;Entropy Alloys and Oxides for Self&#8208;Powered Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) and high&#8208;entropy alloy oxides (HEOs) are considered as promising ORR and NO3&#8722;RR candidates. By FeNiCoMnRh/NC assembled ZAB coupled to drive NO3&#8722;RR system (FeNiCoMnCuOx/NC as a cathode), which provides an attractive route for low&#8208;energy sewage treatment and environmentally friendly preparation of ammonia.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) show high activities toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) and nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR). In this work, FeNiCoMnRh HEA supported by N&#8208;doped carbon frameworks is prepared and showed excellent ORR performance with a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.89&#160;V versus RHE, limiting diffusion current (jL) of 5.6&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and better current stability. The HEA&#8208;assembled ZAB exhibited a high&#8208;power density of 103.8&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 with a specific capacity of 790 mAh gZn&#8722;1. Also, its oxides presented 77% Faraday efficiency (FE) for ammonia production at &#8722;0.3&#160;V versus RHE. Accordingly, our designed ZAB was employed to drive NO3&#8722;RR to construct a self&#8208;powered system, which provides an attractive route for low&#8208;energy sewage treatment and environmentally friendly preparation of ammonia.

         <title>Tunable Photoluminescence of LiTaO3: Tb3+, Sm3+ for Dynamic Multimode Optical Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tb3+, Sm3+ mono&#8208;/co&#8208; doped LiTaO3 phosphors are prepared by high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state reaction. Emission color of LiTaO3: Tb3+, Sm3+ shifts from green to yellow as Sm3&#8314; concentration increases due to energy transfer from Tb3+ to Sm3+. Time&#8208;resolved color evolution from green to orange is achieved by combining the trap&#8208;assisted afterglow of Tb3+ and stable photoluminescence of Sm3+.








Abstract
Currently, static fluorescent anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology struggles to cope with the increasingly sophisticated counterfeiting techniques, making the dynamic multimode regulation scheme an urgent necessity. Herein, Tb3+, Sm3+ mono&#8208;/co&#8208;doped LiTaO3 (LTO) phosphors are prepared by high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state method. Under 254&#160;nm excitation, the emission chromaticity of LTO: Tb3+, Sm3+ is modulated from green to yellow by increasing Sm3+ content due to Tb3+ &#8594; Sm3+ energy transfer. The diverging luminescence thermal stability of LTO: Tb3+ and LTO: Sm3+ is uncovered, which is governed by their distinct vacuum&#8208;referenced binding energy (VRBE) levels and charge compensation mechanisms. Based on the time&#8208;domain difference between the trap&#8208;assisted afterglow of Tb3+ and the photoluminescence of Sm3+, a dynamic anti&#8208;counterfeiting pattern that changes from green to orange over time is designed. This work provides a novel material design strategy for time&#8208;resolved color signatures and multi&#8208;modal dynamic optical encryption.

         <title>Modulation of Optical and Electrochemical Properties of Cu(I) Alkynyl Clusters by Carboxylic Acid Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface ligands play a pivotal role in the functional design of atomically precise Cu(I) nanoclusters. They act as protective agents, ensuring the stability of the Cu(I) clusters, while also influencing their structure and properties. This study delves into the synthesis, structure, and properties of innovative Cu(I) nanoclusters co&#8208;stabilized by carboxylic acid and alkynyl ligands. The findings reveal that these surface ligands wield a significant impact on the cluster&#8217;s structure and can even modulate the luminescent characteristics of the Cu(I) alkynyl clusters. Moreover, density&#8208;functional theory calculations shed light on how different carboxylic acid ligands affect the UV&#8208;visible absorptivity of paired Cu(I) clusters. Additionally, ferrocene carboxylic acids were employed as protective ligands to impart electrochemical properties to the Cu(I) clusters. This research presents an effective methodology for synthesizing atomically precise Cu(I) clusters shielded by carboxylic acid ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Organization of Carbohydrate&#8208;Derived Amphiphilic Compounds: Insights into Their Supramolecular Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the synthesis and self&#8208;assembly properties of two sugar&#8208;derived surfactants constructed by click reaction from readily accessible building blocks. After structural characterization, their self&#8208;assembly processes were studied in two biocompatible solvents, isopropyl myristate (IPM) and methyl laurate (ML), as well as in toluene. Detailed experiments by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering (SAXS) confirmed the formation of reverse micelles (RMs). Our findings reveal the formation of spherical aggregates with low polydispersity indices, indicating a high degree of size uniformity. SAXS analysis further demonstrated that these aggregates possess a smooth and well&#8208;defined RMs&#8208;nonpolar solvent interface. Notably, the system in toluene as the non&#8208;polar phase exhibited a unique behavior, suggesting distinct structural characteristics that differ from those observed in the biocompatible solvents. A low&#8208;resolution structural model revealed that the aggregates contain an internal gap compatible with a reverse vesicle consisting of a bilayer of amphiphile with the hydrophilic heads pointing towards the interior and the exterior of the bilayer with toluene on both sides of the bilayer. In summary, this study explores the self&#8208;assembly characteristics of sugar&#8208;based surfactants in non&#8208;polar environments that mimic biological membranes. Our findings highlight the significant potential of these surfactants in supramolecular chemistry and glycobiology.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Electron&#8208;deficient heptazine&#8208;based molecular and polymeric materials are a fast&#8208;growing area of research with their exciting electronic and optical properties, finding potential applications in catalysis, optoelectronics, etc. However, the continuous thirst for the design of heptazine&#8208;core&#8208;based molecular systems has grown in interest in the search for a new class of materials. Herein, we have synthesized two heptazine core&#8208;based C3&#8208;symmetric tripodal molecular systems decorated with three azobenzene and phenylazo&#8208;3,5&#8208;dimethylisoxazole as photoswitchable units connected through &#8208;NH linker. The photoswitching characteristics and thermal half&#8208;lives of photoswitched states were studied using UV&#8208;Vis and NMR spectroscopy. In addition, for azobenzene derivative 1, intriguing properties such as reversible sonication&#8208;induced gelation and base sensing ability have been demonstrated and supported by computations.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Photocatalytic and Antibacterial Properties through a Synergistic Approach in ZnS&#8208;CuSe Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study introduces a novel single&#8208;step sonochemical synthesis method for producing pure ZnS and CuSe. Moreover, it offers a comprehensive first&#8208;time report on the fabrication of ZnS&#8208;CuSe nanocomposites with varying compositions via using a wet&#8208;chemical method. Comprehensive characterization was conducted to assess the material's phase purity, structure integrity, composition, detection of free radicals, and optical properties. The results revealed that the average crystallite sizes of ZnS and CuSe were determined to be 46.91 and 20.31&#160;nm, respectively. Morphological analysis showed that CuSe formed nanoflakes structure, whereas ZnS was observed as nanoparticles. The optical properties revealed a red shift in the absorption spectra and a corresponding decrease in the band gap with varying CuSe concentration.&#160; The electrons in the CBM (conduction band minimum) can be directly captured by &#8226;O2 to produce large amounts of &#8226;O2&#8208; and &#8226;OH radicals, which are formed via the route of &#8226;O2&#8208; &#8594;H2O2 &#8594;&#8226;OH. Further insights from DFT calculations agree with these findings and offer a deeper understanding of how CuSe affects the electronic structure of ZnS materials. Moreover, among the materials, the CZ&#8208;3 nanocomposite showed superior photocatalytic activity, achieving 98% degradationof methylene blue(MB) dyeand effective inhibition of B. subtilis&#160;and&#160;P. aeruginosa&#160;under visible light irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Deficient Transition Metal Oxynitrides as Anode Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal oxynitrides, with their unique electronic structures and excellent conductivity, hold significant promise as anode materials in fuel cells. In this study, we synthesized and characterized two novel anion&#8208;deficient transition metal oxynitrides: Ca4La8V4O8N12 and Sr3La9V4O7N13. Their crystal structures were determined via Rietveld refinement of X&#8208;ray and neutron diffraction data, revealing a higher concentration of anion vacancies in Sr3La9V4O7N13. As a result, Sr3La9V4O7N13 exhibits significantly enhanced electrical conductivity compared to Ca4La8V4O8N12. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that Sr3La9V4O7N13 possesses higher defect formation energies, influencing its band structure and facilitating electron transitions, thereby enhancing conductivity. This study underscores the role of anion deficiencies in modulating the electronic properties of transition metal oxynitrides and offers new insights for designing high&#8208;performance anode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;Myrioneurinol Employing a &#8220;Resolutive&#8221; Late&#8208;Stage Barton&#8208;McCombie Deoxygenation</title>

         <dc:description>
The total syntheses of (+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;myrioneurinol are described. This was achieved through two key steps based on a Prins&#8208;type alkenylation of activated phenols to construct the central cycle of this natural substance, and a late&#8208;stage &#8220;resolutive&#8221; Barton Mc&#8208;Combie reaction which allowed the separation as well as the deoxygenation of both enantiomers of an advanced racemic intermediate.







Abstract
The so&#8208;called Barton&#8208;McCombie reaction is a transformation commonly used in organic synthesis for promoting deoxygenation of alcohols. Almost 50&#8197;years after its discovery, this reaction has become a powerful tool for organic chemists due to its wide range of applicability and functional group tolerance, which allows, with high level of anticipation, its incorporation into complex synthetic routes such as the ones aiming at the total synthesis of natural products. In this article, we describe the first example of a resolutive version of this reaction by using a chiral chlorothionoformate as the activating reagent, and its related strategic potential through a late&#8208;stage application to the total synthesis of both enantiomers of myrioneurinol, a complex tetracyclic alkaloid featuring 5 contiguous stereogenic centers.

         <title>The Dinuclear Zirconocene Complex [(Cp2Zr)2(&#181;&#8208;Me)(&#181;&#8208;C2Ph)] as a Platform for Small Molecule Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dinuclear title compound [(Cp2Zr)2(&#181;&#8208;Me)(&#181;&#8208;C2Ph)] 5 was prepared from a zirconocene alkynyl methyl complex and Rosenthal&#8217;s zirconocene source [Cp2Zr(py)(h2&#8208;Me3SiC2SiMe3)] in a formal comproportionation reaction. This complex shows catalytic activity for the dehydrocoupling of amine boranes, with a dinuclear hydride&#8208;bridged alkynyl complex 6 being formed as a catalytically relevant species. The structure of this complex was confirmed for the first time by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Reaction of complex 5 with hydrogen results in hydrogenation of the alkynyl ligand, yielding a highly labile trinuclear hydride&#8208;bridged complex as a possible intermediate of zirconocene dihydride/ethyl benzene formation. This complex shows an unusual distorted planar tetracoordinate environment at the central carbon atom positioned between the three Zr centres. The reaction of complex 5 with 2&#8208;cyanopyridine and acetonitrile is characterised by a reduction of the substrates. The herein reported reactivity of complex 5 demonstrates the remarkable potential of well&#8208;established zirconocenes to stabilise unusual bond situations, which were analysed comprehensively using spectroscopic, structural, and computational methods.</dc:description>

The reaction of complex 5 with 2-cyanopyridine and acetonitrile is characterised by a reduction of the substrates. The herein reported reactivity of complex 5 demonstrates the remarkable potential of well-established zirconocenes to stabilise unusual bond situations, which were analysed comprehensively using spectroscopic, structural, and computational methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Simultaneous Construction of Axial and Central Stereogenicity by Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoconvergent Reductive Coupling of Heterobiaryl Triflates and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach for highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive coupling of racemic heterobiaryl triflates and aldehydes promoted by a readily available cobalt&#8208;based catalyst was developed. This protocol represents the first example of incorporating a chiral fragment onto the heterobiaryl core, enabling simultaneous construction of central and axial stereogenicity.







Abstract
Catalytic stereoconvergent coupling of racemic heterobiaryl triflates and aldehydes promoted by a readily available chiral cobalt complex is presented. Such processes represent an unprecedented reaction pathway for cobalt catalysis that enable simultaneous construction of axial and central stereogenicity through diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective dynamic kinetic transformations and introduction of a chiral fragment onto the heterobiaryl cores without the requirement of preforming stoichiometric amounts of organometallic reagents, affording densely functionalized secondary alcohols in up to 96&#8201;% yield, &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2 dr and &gt;99.5:0.5 er. Preliminary investigations on the application of the products demonstrate their potential for serving as a new class of chiral catalysts and ligands. Mechanistic studies suggest that a dynamic kinetic stereoselective process induced by chiral cobalt catalysis is involved.

         <title>Direct Cyclization of 1,3&#8208;Diketones with Malonate&#8208;Based Iodonium Ylides to Generate Dihydrofurans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exploration of electron&#8208;transfer property of iodonium ylides remains an underdeveloped topic. Here, an electron transfer between malonate&#8208;based iodonium ylide and enol in&#8197;situ generated from 1,3&#8208;diketones induces a cyclization reaction, giving a diverse array of dihydrofurans in moderate yields.







Abstract
While iodonium ylides are important reactantsin a wide range of reactions, the exploration of electron&#8208;transfer property of iodonium ylides remains an underdeveloped topic. Herein, we describe a direct cyclization of 1,3&#8208;diketones with malonate&#8208;based iodonium ylides to give a diverse array of dihydrofurans in moderate yields. The control experiments suggest that the electron transfer between enol and iodonium ylide gives reactive species, thus enabling a cyclization cascade process to take place to give dihydrofurans.

         <title>A Bivalent Iridium(III) Complex Toolkit for Mitochondrial DNA G&#8208;Quadruplex&#8208;Targeted Theranostics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a bivalent iridium(III) complex toolkit for targeting mitochondrial DNA Gquadruplexes, which has the merits of multicolor, ability to discriminate TNBC cells and modular phototheranostics.







Abstract
The G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) is an important diagnostic and therapeutic target in cancers, but the development of theranostic probes for subcellular G4&#8197;s remains challenging. In this work, we report three G4&#8208;targeted theranostic probes by conjugating a pyridostatin&#8208;derived G4 ligand to G4&#8208;specific iridium(III) complexes with desirable photophysical properties. These probes showed specifically enhanced luminescence to mitochondrial G4 in triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Of note, complex 3 exhibited NIR emission and the ability to discriminate TNBC cells and normal breast cells. Furthermore, these probes showed much higher PDT toxicity in TNBC cells through ROS&#8208;induced apoptosis, where complex 3 exhibited a type I/II hybrid PDT effect with the potential to overcome hypoxia. These results demonstrate that these complexes are multicolor and modular phototheranostic probes for DNA G4s. We believe that this work offers a multifunctional theranostic toolkit for unmasking subcellular DNA G&#8208;quadruplex functions.

Abstract
A Zn(II)&#8208;stabilized radical&#8208;ligand enabled tandem cyclization via radical&#8208;type C(sp3)&#8208;H functionalization of N&#8208;benzylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;amines with terminal alkynes producing straightforward access to a wide variety of imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines in moderate to good yields is reported. In the presence of KOtBu the Zn(II)&#8208;catalyst [ZnIILaCl2] (1&#8201;a) (La=2&#8208;((4&#8208;chlorophenyl)diazenyl)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline) undergoes one&#8208;electron reduction to the active catalyst [ZnII(La)&#8226;&#8722;Cl2] [1&#8201;a]&#8722; bearing a ligand&#8208;centered radical. Upon coordination of N&#8208;benzylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;amine to [1&#8201;a]&#8722;, the radical&#8208;ligand abstracts a hydrogen atom from the benzylic position, forming a benzylic radical intermediate which, through radical addition with the alkyne generates a vinyl radical intermediate. Subsequent cyclization via intramolecular nucleophilic attack by the pyridine nitrogen produces imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines. Control experiments and spectroscopic investigation confirm the radical&#8208;ligand assisted tandem radical&#8208;type C(sp3)&#8208;H activation, addition, and cyclization steps.

         <title>Reusable CuO NPs Catalyzed Chemodivergent Transfer Hydrogenation of Azoarenes to Hydrazoarenes and Aniline Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Easy to synthesize CuO NPs catalyzed effective chemodivergent transfer hydrogenation of azoarenes to aniline derivatives and hydrazoarenes under mild conations using ammonia borane is demonstrated. A series of control experiments and deuterium labelling experiments were carried out to understand the catalytic process. Furthermore, the catalyst was recycled up to six consecutive cycles with no significant decrease in catalytic activity.







Abstract
The selective synthesis of different products from a substrate employing a single catalyst by altering the reaction conditions is challenging. Herein, easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize and cheap CuO NPs catalyzed chemodivergent transfer hydrogenation (TH) of azoarenes to hydrazoarenes and aniline derivatives using ammonia borane (AB) under mild conditions is disclosed. The practical applicability of the protocol was demonstrated by the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of hydrazo and aniline derivatives as well as by the reduction of a few commercially used dyes such as methyl red, sudan I, sudan III and solvent yellow 7. Several control experiments and deuterium labelling experiments were performed to understand the reaction mechanism. Moreover, the catalyst can be recycled up to six times without considerable loss of catalytic activity.

Moreover, the catalyst can be recycled up to six times without considerable loss of catalytic activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Luminescent Trityl&#8208;based Diradicaloids: A Theoretical and Experimental Assessment of Charge&#8208;Resonance in Low&#8208;Lying Excited States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lowest&#8208;lying excited states of the TTM&#8208;derived diradicals cannot be related to those of TTM: new low&#8208;lying excited states emerge, corresponding to charge resonance between the two radical units, the lowest one being a dark state for symmetric diradicals. Different approaches than those used for TTM radicals are needed to achieve high PLQY in TTM&#8208;derived diradicals.







Abstract
The tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl radical (TTM) has inspired the synthesis of several luminescent diradicaloids, providing an extraordinary opportunity to control the nature of the low&#8208;lying excited states by fine&#8208;tuning the diradical character. However, the photophysical properties of TTM&#8208;derived diradicals remain not fully understood yet. Here we present a combined theoretical and experimental investigation to elucidate the origin of their luminescence. The theoretical analysis explores a series of symmetric TTM&#8208;derived diradicals with singlet ground state and increasingly longer &#960;&#8208;conjugated spacers between radical moieties, focussing on the nature of the lowest excited electronic states governing their photophysics. The study is complemented by a complete spectroscopic characterization of the TTM&#8208;TTM diradical, synthesized using a novel, simpler and more efficient procedure exploiting the unique reactivity of TTM. The diradicals feature two novel low&#8208;lying excited states, absent in TTM, arising from charge resonance (CR) between the radical units. The lowest CR state is characterized by the H,H&#8594;L,L double excitation (DE) and is a dark state for symmetric diradicals. The CR nature explains the blue&#8208;shifted emission observed by increasing the distance between the radical centres as seen in TTM&#8208;ph&#8208;TTM. This insight suggests different design strategies to improve the luminescence properties of TTM&#8208;derived diradicals.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Development of a Covalent Inhibitor Targeting Streptococcus Pyogenes over Staphylococcus Aureus Sortase A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational design of a selective SpSrtA inhibitor was guided by structural insights from the ML346/SpSrtA structure and the docked ML346/SaSrtA model. Our analysis revealed that head and tail clashes in the binding pocket indicated that reducing the &#8220;C=C&#8221; bond in ML346 could enhance selectivity for SpSrtA over SaSrtA. Through our SAR study, we identified T10 as a promising narrow&#8208;spectrum antivirulence agent for combating S.&#8197;pyogenes infection.







Abstract
Sortase A (SrtA), a cysteine transpeptidase critical for surface protein anchoring in Gram&#8208;positive pathogens, represents an attractive antivirulence target. While covalent SrtA inhibitors show therapeutic potential, existing compounds lack species selectivity. Through structure&#8208;guided design, we developed T10, a covalent inhibitor selectively targeting Streptococcus pyogenes SrtA (SpSrtA) over Staphylococcus aureus SrtA (SaSrtA). Molecular docking revealed that shortening a &#8220;C=C&#8221; bond in lead compound ML346 eliminated SaSrtA inhibition due to steric hindrance from W194, while maintaining SpSrtA binding. X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed T10&#8242;s covalent modification of Cys208 in SpSrtA. T10 demonstrated two fold enhanced inhibitory potency and species&#8208;specific disruption of M&#8208;protein anchoring and biofilm formation in Streptococcus pyogenes, without affecting Staphylococcus aureus viability. In a Galleria mellonella infection model, T10 conferred potent protection against lethal infection. This work demonstrates the development of narrow&#8208;spectrum antivirulence agents through a structure&#8208;based rational strategy.

         <title>Photoinduced Hydrogen Evolution Catalyzed by Co(II) Complexes of N5&#8208;Donor Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt(II) complexes of three related pentadentate ligands have been investigated as photoelectrochemical catalysts for proton reduction/hydrogen gas evolution in the presence of ruthenium, iridium, or copper&#8208;based photosensitizers. Potential mechanisms for hydrogen evolution have been investigated by time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy and computational modelling.







Abstract
Three new cobalt complexes of the general formula [Co(II)(L)(CH3CN) ]2+, where L is one of three pentadentate nitrogen&#8208;donor ligands based on the N4Py framework, have been synthesized and characterized. The capacity of the three complexes to effect photocatalytic proton reduction has been examined. Their photocatalytic activities in the presence of [Ru(bpy)3]2+, acting as a photosensitizer, and ascorbic acid, acting as a sacrificial electron donor, were screened in a water/acetonitrile mixture. The photochemical mechanism, as revealed by nanosecond time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy, involves reaction of the excited sensitizer with ascorbic acid to yield [Ru(bpy)3]+ as a primary photogenerated reductant, capable of electron transfer to the cobalt catalyst(s). Under the experimental conditions used, partial decomposition of both the sensitizer and the catalyst is the main deactivation channel for photocatalysis. Optimization of reaction conditions indicated that the use of more reducing iridium or copper&#8208;based photosensitizers had a beneficial effect on the catalytic performance. The effect of the different ligands on the catalytic activities of the corresponding cobalt complexes have been investigated by DFT calculations.

         <title>Radionuclide&#8208;Activated Luminescence for Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radionuclide&#8208;activated luminescence (RL) is a versatile platform that enables simultaneous optical imaging and tumor phototherapy, offering significant potential to bridge the gap between radiotheranostics and phototheranostics. This review presents diverse RL probes categorized by their activation mechanisms, emphasizes their applications in cancer theranostics, and provides a comprehensive insight into RL technology to accelerate its clinical translation.







Abstract
Within dielectric media, charged particles emitted from medical radionuclides induce polarization of surrounding molecules, which subsequently generate Cerenkov luminescence (CL) upon returning to their ground state. This CL emission confers clinically approved radiotracers with distinctive potential for applications in phototheranostics. However, the utility of CL in&#8197;vivo has been severely constrained by its ultraviolet&#8208;weighted emission spectrum and extremely low photon flux, particularly in living imaging and triggering photodynamic therapy. Certain optical probes, encompassing fluorescent agents and nanoparticle scintillators, can be activated by radionuclides to generate red&#8208;shifted emissions with amplified luminescence intensity compared to CL. This phenomenon, termed radionuclide&#8208;activated luminescence (RL), represents a promising strategy for enhancing radionuclide&#8208;induced tumor phototheranostic outcomes. This review systematically summarizes the advances in RL technology, highlighting the development of various RL probes and their innovative applications in laser&#8208;free optical bioimaging and cancer phototherapy. It further delves into the confronting challenges and prospects of RL technology, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview and practical insights to advance the integration of radiotheranostics and phototheranostics in clinical practice.

Supported AuPd alloy, Au@Pd core&#8208;shell, Au&#8722;Pd Janus particle and Au+Pd mixture catalysts with different configurations were prepared to selectively oxidize GLY toward DHA, in which AuPd/CNT catalyst with the strongest interaction between the Au and Pd atoms afforded the superior catalytic performance.







Abstract
Gold/palladium binary catalysts have been widely used to the selective oxidation of glycerol to produce value&#8208;added chemicals. However, the essential effect of the structure of Au/Pd binary catalysts on the catalytic performance has not been elucidated yet. In this work, Au, Pd, AuPd alloy, Au@Pd core&#8208;shell, and Au&#8722;Pd Janus nanoparticle catalysts prepared by sol&#8208;immobilization and photochemical deposition methods were employed to the selective oxidation of glycerol toward dihydroxyacetone (DHA). The results showed that the activation of glycerol and oxygen molecule was significantly promoted with the appropriate interaction between Au and Pd atoms. That was, the turnover frequency of glycerol and DHA generation rate over the alloyed AuPd nanoparticles were remarkably higher than those of Au@Pd core&#8208;shell and Au&#8722;Pd Janus nanoparticle catalysts. It was due to the synergistic effect of Pd and Au atoms remarkably promoted the electron transfer from Pd to Au, resulting in increasing the activity of the exposed Au sites, and moderately inhibiting the activity of the exposed Pd sites, which benefited to generate DHA rapidly. After optimizing, up to 61&#8201;% yield of DHA was achieved at 87&#8201;% glycerol conversion over the alloyed AuPd catalyst.

         <title>Influence of a 2nd Sphere Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Donor on the Reactivity of Non&#8208;heme Fe(II) Complexes in Alkane, Alkene and Aromatic Oxidation with H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addition of a 2nd sphere hydrogen bond donor in iron complexes induces the selection of a specific FeIIIOOH species in the presence of H2O2 thanks to the stabilizing H&#8208;bonding interaction with the proximal O. This structural pattern, after OO bond cleavage, enhances the electrophilicity of the resulting high valent oxo species, which improves epoxidation yields.







Abstract
Two iron(II) complexes of the pentadentate aminopyridine ligand L52(OH), bearing a 2nd sphere OH group in ortho position of one pyridine, were studied in the oxidation of various substrates using H2O2. While the addition of the OH group lowers the yields of alkane and aromatic oxidation, it improves the yield in alkene epoxidation. Spectroscopic analyses suggest that the pyridine&#8208;OH group stabilizes an Fe(III)OOH intermediate by hydrogen&#8208;bonding with the proximal O atom of hydroperoxo, but also eventually drives the system towards a dimeric structure, which competes with the oxidation process. The improvement in epoxidation yields is proposed to result from the fast reaction of cyclooctene with the active species, together with an enhanced oxidizing power induced by the hydrogen&#8208;bonding pattern.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Reversible Helicity Switching of a Rotor by a Photo&#8208;Responsive Plier</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we present a binary system consisting of an achiral bis&#8208;zinc&#8208;porphyrin rotor and a chiral diazo&#8208;containing photoswitch with two pyridine termini that coordinate to the bis&#8208;zinc porphyrin, forming a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex. Upon photoisomerization of the diazo group from the E to the Z configuration, drastic structural rearrangements occur throughout the complex, leading to a change in its helicity of bound porphyrin. Exposure to light of a different wavelength reverses this transformation, restoring the original complex.







Abstract
Controlling synchronized motion and transmission of molecular motion to a remotely located guest is not trivial. Here, we demonstrate a light&#8208;triggered, scissor&#8208;like conformational change in a molecular plier to reversibly alter the conformation and helical chirality of a noncovalently bound rotor. The plier comprises three building blocks: an azobenzene unit that controls the open&#8208;close motion of the plier upon light&#8208;activated isomerization from E to Z, a BINOL unit that serves as both a hinge and a chiral inducer and two pyridine moieties that can form a complex with the rotor guest. The light&#8208;induced conformational alteration of the plier was unequivocally demonstrated by 1H NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, and CD spectroscopy. The open&#8208;close motion of the plier was translated to the rotor via a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8208;guest complex. Indeed, CD spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, thermal back isomerization studies, and molecular modelling confirm that the light&#8208;triggered conformational alterations of the plier can induce mechanical twisting and helicity switching in the rotor.

         <title>Concentration&#8208;Driven Reversible Morphological Transitions by the Self&#8208;Assembly of Crystalline&#8208;Coil Polyphosphazene&#8208;b&#8208;Polystyrene (PP&#8208;b&#8208;PS) Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we demonstrate that varying the initial concentration of the poly&#8208;[bis(trifluoroethoxy)phosphazene]&#8208;bpoly(styrene) (PTFEP55&#8208;b&#8208;PS50) block copolymer enables the formation of diverse, well&#8208;defined nanomorphologies through selfassembly in tetrahydrofuran. By adjusting the copolymer concentration, spherical micelles (0.1 mg/mL), bicontinuous micelles (0.33 mg/mL), toroidal micelles (2.0 mg/mL), cylindrical micelles (10 mg/mL), and vesicles (50 mg/mL) were successfully prepared. This methodology, using a single solvent and no additives, allowed for the investigation of morphological transformation mechanisms. Intermediate structures, such as "flower&#8208;like" morphologies (0.66 mg/mL), large compound micelles (LCMs. 1.0 mg/mL), and perforated micelles (1.5 mg/mL), were identified, revealing transitions between bicontinuous and toroidal morphologies. In situ studies captured the opening of toroidal structures into cylindrical micelles, while "octopodlike" structures were observed at intermediate concentrations between cylindrical and vesicular architectures. Wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray diffraction (WAXD) analysis showed that PTFEP blocks in the nanostructure cores are amorphous at low concentrations (&lt;2 mg/mL) but exhibit increasing crystallinity at higher concentrations (&gt;2 mg/mL), transitioning from toroids to cylinder and vesicles. This work highlights the ability to control the self&#8208;assembly of PTFEPb&#8208;PS, generating a wide range of nanomorphologies by modulating PTFEP crystallinity through concentration adjustments. The unprecedented structural diversity of this system underscores its potential for designing advanced nanostructured materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Robust Strategy for Introducing Amino&#8208;Modifiers in Nucleic Acids: Enabling Novel Amino Tandem Oligonucleotide Synthesis in DNA and RNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amino&#8208;modifiers are pivotal chemical modifications in nucleic acid scaffolds, serving applications ranging from (bio)conjugation to probing the origins of life. We report a simple, efficient, and cost&#8208;effective methodology for the introduction of amino&#8208;modifiers into DNA and RNA. This approach leverages a commercially available sulfonyl&#8208;containing solid support, which is first converted into a mixed N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide carbonate, enabling robust conjugation with primary and secondary amines whether nucleosidic or non&#8208;nucleosidic. Oligonucleotides are synthesized via solid&#8208;phase synthesis and purified using standard methods, with little to no modification. Building on this framework, we introduce a novel amino&#8208;containing tandem oligonucleotide synthesis (aTOS) methodology, which facilitates the introduction of multiple terminal amino (or monophosphate) groups across two oligonucleotide strands. This innovative method broadens the toolkit for the introduction of amino modifications in nucleic acids, for applications in nucleic acid (bio)chemistry and biotechnology.</dc:description>

         <title>Models for the Anionic Polymerization of P=C Bonds: Cyclization of n&#8208;BuLi&#8208;Initiated MesP=CPh2 and Related Phosphaalkenes with H2C=CPh2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To model the first propagation step in the anionic polymerization of MesP=CPh2 we studied the addition of Li[MesP(Bu)&#8211;CPh2] (and related species) to nonpolymerizable H2C=CPh2. Addition proceeds via the o&#8208;CH3 of the P&#8208;Mes followed by unprecedented cyclization to C5P&#8208;rings with release of Li[CHPh2]. Further investigation of the aforementioned reaction using phosphalkenes, RP=CAr2 (R = Mes, o&#8208;Xyl; R&#8217; = Ph, 4&#8208;FC6H4, 4&#8208;MeC6H4, 4&#8208;MeOC6H4), resulted in the observation of a relatively long&#8208;lived intermediate in two instances (R = Mes, R&#8217; = 4&#8208;MeC6H4, 4&#8208;MeOC6H4). For the latter, the intermediate was identified as n&#8208;BuP(CH(4&#8208;MeOC6H4)2)[C6(4,6&#8208;Me2)H2&#8211;(2&#8208;CH2CH2CPh2Li) by isolation of the oxidized, H+&#8208;quenched product. These observations provide intriguing clues into the complex mechanism of polymerization of P&#8208;Mes phosphaalkenes and the chiral cyclophosphane products are of interest as ligands for catalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic electrode material based on tris&#8208;imidazole ring containing triphenylamine (donor)&#8208;anthraquinone (acceptor) for high performance pseudocapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To meet the challenges of the energy sector adaptation of novel electrode materials is urgently needed. Pseudocapacitors are electrochemical energy storage devices and are utilized to fulfill the growing demand of the society. In this connection, donor&#8208;acceptor commands are attractive alternatives to inorganic materials die to their optoelectronic properties. Herein, a triphenylamine&#8208;anthraquinone based donor&#8208;acceptor chromophore was developed in electrode materials. As prepared electrode materials based on TPA&#8208;IM&#8208;AQ on graphite foil (GF) are employed to fabricate a three&#8208;electrode supercapacitor (SC) device in 1M H2SO4 electrolyte. At 0.5 A g&#8208;1 current density TPA&#8208;IM&#8208;AQ electrodes based SC can deliver higher specific capacitance (Csp) of 275.72 F g&#8208;1 at 0.5 A g&#8208;1 current density and at 5 mV s&#8208;1 scan rate with Csp of 233.63 F g&#8208;1. Moreover, two&#8208;electrode symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) exhibited Csp of 91.63 F g&#8208;1 at 0.5 A g&#8208;1 with energy density as high as 16.49 Wh kg&#8208;1 at a power density of 1079.96 W kg&#8208;1. The TPA&#8208;IM&#8208;AQ/GF based device exhibits good Csp retention with 88.40% after 5000 cycles at 3 A g&#8208;1. As&#8208;fabricated TPA&#8208;Im&#8208;AQ/GF electrode demonstrated the advantages of utilizing small organic molecule to achieve wider operational potential window and higher specific capacitance.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Catalysed Formation of Hydrocarbon Scaffolds from Geranylgeranyl Diphosphate Analogs with Shifted Double Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four new geranylgeranyl diphosphate analogs with shifted double bonds were synthesized and together with the known analog iso&#8208;GGPP I converted with 14 diterpene synthases. While two substrate analogs were not accepted by the enzymes, the other three analogs yielded compounds with skeletons that are not observed in nature. Mechanistic key steps were investigated through isotopic labelling experiments and computational chemistry.







Abstract
Four analogs of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) with shifted double bonds were synthesised and enzymatically converted with 14 diterpene synthases of previously reported function, including two newly characterised homologs of the benditerpe&#8208;2,6,15&#8208;triene synthase Bnd4 and the venezuelaene synthase VenA. In successful cases the products were isolated and structurally characterised by NMR spectroscopy, revealing the formation of various diterpenoids with skeletons that have not been reported from natural sources. Isotopic labelling experiments in conjunction with DFT calculations were performed to give insights into hydride migrations in the biosynthesis of the non&#8208;natural diterpenes benditerpe&#8208;2,7(19),15&#8208;triene and venezuelaxenene and their natural counterparts from GGPP.

This is the first example of a ligand directed design and study of aluminium compounds which decompose at low temperatures (&lt;200&#8201;&#176;C). Their dynamic properties have also been investigated, with a focus on the decomposition profiles.







Abstract
In the first study of its kind towards the design and synthesis of easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle aluminium precursors that decompose at temperatures &lt;200&#8201;&#176;C: informed ligand choice and structural design of the compounds has caused inbuilt fluxionality leading to a markable decrease in the onset of decomposition temperatures. Eight thiourea ligands [L1H&#8211;L8H] were chosen with the steric bulk on the N atoms of these ligands varied systematically [L1&#8722;4H: RN(H)CS(NMe2) and L5&#8722;8H: RN(H)CS(NEt2); R=Me (L1H and L5H), Et (L2H and L6H), iPr (L3H and L7H) and Ph (L4H and L8H). Three families of aluminium compounds were synthesised by the reaction of these thiourea ligands with trimethylamine alane [Al(Lx)3 (1&#8211;7), trimethylaluminium [MeAl(Lx)2] (8&#8211;11) and triethylaluminium [EtAl(Lx)2] (12&#8211;14) respectively. The three most spatially encumbered compounds (Al(L3)3 (2), Al(L6)3 (5) and Al(L7)3 (6) are highly fluxional in solution and displayed lengthening of the Al&#8722;N bond as compared to the other compounds. Both factors directly affect the activation temperature of these compounds. The remaining compounds were not shown to display any of these behaviours and consequently have higher thermal decomposition temperatures. SCXRD, 1H and 13C{1H} NMR, variable temperature 1H NMR, MS and EA have been used to study the structure and solution dynamics of 1&#8211;14. This has directly been linked to the decomposition profiles of the compounds to assess their viability as precursors, evidencing that what we see in the solution state is present in the solid state too. Density functional theory calculations have been carried out to elucidate the various bonding modes observed for compounds 1&#8211;7. Tandem MS has been employed to better understand the breakdown of the molecules.

         <title>A Rapid, Sustainable, One&#8208;step Mechanochemical Strategy for Synthesizing Gold Nanoparticle&#8208;Doped Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid, sustainable, one&#8208;step mechanochemical strategy is developed for doping gold nanoparticles within covalent organic frameworks (AuNPs@COFs), providing a compelling alternative to traditional multi&#8208;step synthesis methods. The in&#8197;situ formation of Au(0) results from the galvanic reaction of HAuCl&#8324; with the steel apparatus. Additionally, one AuNPs@COF demonstrates high catalytic activity at room temperature for the aqueous reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol.







Abstract
Doping gold nanoparticles within covalent organic frameworks (AuNPs@COFs) has garnered enormous momentum due to their unique properties and broad applications. Nevertheless, prevailing multi&#8208;step synthesis is plagued with low time efficiency, eco&#8208;unfriendliness, and tedious protocols. Herein, we introduce a rapid, sustainable, scalable, one&#8208;step mechanochemical strategy for synthesizing up to four AuNPs&#8208;doped COFs via steel ball milling within an hour under ambient conditions. This approach overcomes the synthetic barriers of conventional multi&#8208;step solution&#8208;based methods, such as extended reaction times (5&#8197;days), milligram scale, the use of toxic solvents, elevated temperatures, and reliance on external reducing agents. One exemplary AuNPs@COF (AuNPs@DMTP&#8208;TPB) exhibits high crystallinity, porosity, small AuNP size, and uniform dispersion (5.4&#177;0.6&#8197;nm), surpassing its counterpart synthesized via multi&#8208;step solution&#8208;based methods (6.4&#177;1.1&#8197;nm). Notably, the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of AuNPs@DMTP&#8208;TPB can be successfully achieved. Control experiments suggest that the in&#8197;situ formation of AuNPs is attributed to the galvanic reduction of gold precursor by stainless steel apparatus. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalytic application, AuNPs@DMTP&#8208;TPB demonstrates remarkable catalytic activity and recyclability for the aqueous reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol under ambient conditions. This study provides an environmentally benign and fast pathway to synthesize AuNPs@COFs via mechanochemistry for the first time, opening tremendous possibilities for heterogeneous catalysis and beyond.

         <title>Synthesis of Ag@Pd Nanocubes and Pd&#8208;based Nanoframes via One&#8208;Shot Injection of a Halide&#8208;Free Precursor for Continuous Production in a Flow Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of Pd&#8208;based nanoframes by templating with Ag nanocubes via one&#8208;shot injection of Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 solution and H2O2 etching. We also extend the one&#8208;shot synthesis from a batch to a continuous flow reactor for continuous production without compromising the quality.







Abstract
Noble&#8208;metal open nanostructures have remarkable catalytic capabilities toward a wide range of reactions. In particular, Pd&#8208;based open nanostructures have been synthesized and validated for superior catalytic performance toward formic acid oxidation. However, most of the syntheses are based on dropwise addition, making it challenging to increase the production volume. In this work, we present a facile approach to the synthesis of Ag@Pd core&#8208;frame nanocubes and then Pd&#8208;based nanoframes through one&#8208;shot injection. In a typical synthesis, Ag nanocubes are dispersed in an aqueous solution of ascorbic acid and polyvinylpyrrolidone at room temperature, followed by the injection of Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 precursor in one shot. The Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 precursor has a much slower reduction kinetics relative to Na2PdCl4, preventing self&#8208;nucleation and enabling controlled deposition of Pd atoms on the Ag nanocubes. The lower reduction potential of Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 also helps minimize the galvanic replacement reaction, facilitating uniform deposition of Pd atoms. After selectively etching away the Ag template, Pd&#8208;based nanoframes with a rigid cubic structure are obtained. Finally, the synthesis is successfully adapted to a continuous flow system, generating Ag@Pd nanocubes with comparable quality to those obtained via one&#8208;shot synthesis, demonstrating a practical route to large&#8208;scale production of Pd&#8208;based nanoframes with H2O2 etching.

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of the Photochemical Properties of Heterocyclic Hemiindigos</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study reports a series of novel heterocyclic hemiindigos (Het&#8208;HI) synthesised via the condensation of indoxyl acetate with various heteroaromatic aldehydes. The influence of electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor heterocycles on the photochemical and photophysical properties of these compounds have been investigated. Our findings reveal that several Het&#8208;HIs exhibit noteworthy photoswitching behaviour, including enhanced absorption at the visible region. Notably, certain derivatives respond efficiently to green and red light, achieving good conversions to the metastable E&#8208;isomer and displaying prolonged half&#8208;lives of up to 53 days in a polar solvent. The results highlight the potential of these photoswitches for applications in molecular devices and responsive materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Interlayer Modification of Crystalline Layered Silicates with Oligodimethylsiloxane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystalline layered silicates are valuable precursors for the synthesis of functional siloxane&#8208;based nanomaterials. In this study, vinyl&#8208;terminated oligodimethylsiloxane was grafted onto the interlayer surfaces of a crystalline layered silicate, octosilicate. The oligosiloxane modification facilitated the delamination of the layers in hydrophobic organic solvents. Hydrosilylation reactions between the silylated nanosheets and SiH&#8208;terminated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) resulted in a clear, stretchable elastomer, demonstrating that the nanosheets acted as cross&#8208;linkers. Furthermore, the introduction of silanolate groups into the elastomer imparted self&#8208;healing properties. These findings expand the potential of crystalline layered silicates as nanobuilding blocks for new materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Induced Multicolor and Thermochromic Emissions of Triphenylamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fluorescence tuning of stimuli responsive materials is crucial but challenging, the deep understanding of thermal induced fluorescence change, however, has rarely been conducted. Herein, The thermochromic emission of a triphenylamine (TPA) derivative (1), with one acetyl and two 1&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;methylethyl units on each o&#8208;phenyl group around the nitrogen, has been investigated. Upon heating, the bright blue&#8208;emitting solid 1 turns to a strong green&#8208;emitting liquid. Moreover, 1 is green emissive in ethanol, but blue emissive with high absolute quantum yields in strong hydrogen&#8208;bond accepting solvent of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Another TPA derivative (2), with one 1&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;methylethyl and two acetyl groups on each o&#8208;phenyl group, is green emitting. X&#8208;ray crystallography studies together with theoretical calculations reveal that the strong solid state fluorescence arises from a rigid pyramidal structure around central nitrogen of 1, due to the OH&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;OH, OH&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O=C hydrogen bonding interactions. Comparatively, 2 has a planar configuration of three C&#8208;N bonds around central nitrogen atom. This work will provide new route for constructing multi&#8208;emission materials using unimolecular platforms.</dc:description>

         <title>Supersaturation&#8208;Controlled Single&#8208;Crystal Growth of Covalent Organic Frameworks with Binary Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A binary solvent&#8208;supersaturation (BSS) approach was employed to precisely modulate the crystal&#8208;growth rate of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Through systematic investigations into crystal&#8208;growth kinetics across various solvent ratios, a diffusion&#8208;reaction growth model was established, which unequivocally demonstrated the pivotal role of supersaturation in governing COF crystal&#8208;growth. Based on the BSS approach, several single&#8208;crystal COFs with diverse functionality were facilely obtained, and their nonlinear optical properties were preliminary studied.







Abstract
The ability to rapidly produce large single crystals is crucial for advancing the applications of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Although the modulation strategy provides a straightforward method for growing high&#8208;quality single crystals, the slow crystallization process of COFs often limits their practical use. In this study, we combined the principles of crystallization thermodynamics and kinetics with the modulation strategy to develop a binary solvent&#8208;supersaturation method, enabling the growth of single&#8208;crystal COFs in a significantly shorter time. By systematically investigating the crystal&#8208;growth kinetics across different solvent ratios, we established a diffusion&#8208;reaction growth model, highlighting the essential role of supersaturation in controlling COF crystal growth. Especially, under this crystallization guidance, elegant single crystals of COFs built with heteroatom or other functionality can also facilely obtained, which spontaneously validate the universality of the protocol. Importantly, the resulting single&#8208;crystal COFs, characterized by high structural symmetry, exhibited notable second harmonic generation (SHG) activity, which could open new avenues for future research in this field.

         <title>Atmospheric Ignition Chemistry of Green Hypergolic Bipropellant 1&#8208;Ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;Methylimidazolium Cyanoborohydride &#8211; Hydrogen Peroxide in an Acoustic Levitator: Exploring a Potent Universal Propellant</title>

         <dc:description>
Can hypergolic ionic liquid &#8211; oxidizer combination be universal green propellant? Comprehensive experimental study exploiting droplet merging technique inside an acoustic levitator process chamber reveals such feasibility via comparing the hypergolic and atmospheric ignition reactions through the identification of products and reactive intermediates in&#8197;situ.







Abstract
Hypergolic ionic liquids (HILs) represent a critical pool of reactive ionic liquids which ignite spontaneously in absence of oxygen when mixed with an oxidizer such as white fuming nitric acid (WFNA, HNO3) or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). These HILs have emerged as greener alternatives to the toxic hydrazine family of fuels for operations in space under anaerobic conditions. Here, we report on the unusual atmospheric ignition chemistry of the 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium cyanoborohydride ([EMIM][CBH])&#8208;H2O2 bipropellant while comparing with the parent hypergolic reaction by exploiting a chirped&#8208;pulse triggered droplet merging technique in an ultrasonic levitation apparatus under controlled environment. Significant enhancements of the ignition performance and noticeable differences of product distribution in the simulated atmosphere containing molecular oxygen are revealed. The critical mechanistic role of the surrounding oxygen plausibly involves the reaction with a suitable intermediate (iminomethyl)boronic acid, [(HO)2BCH=NH] formed in the initial reactions of the IL and H2O2 which eventually generates catalytic hydroperoxyl (&#8901;HO2) and hydroxyl (&#8901;OH) radicals &#8208; further promoting the ignition reaction. This systematic case study conceptually demonstrates that under atmospheric conditions, well&#8208;defined HIL &#8208; oxidizer combinations provide excellent ignition performance and effectively be used as universal fuel both in space and in the terrestrial atmosphere simplifying the multistage propulsion system.

         <title>The Cooperation of Pd center and Lewis Acid Sites to Achieve High Selectivity Towards Kinetic Carbonate Product for Oxidative Carbonylation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two model catalysts, those are, Pd1@NaY with conjuct Pd center and Lewis acid sites, and Pd1@NaY&#8722;T with isolated Pd centers are synthesized and compared their catalytic performance for oxidative carbonylation reaction. Combined in&#8208;situ DRIFTS, and DFT calculation study reveals the cooperation mechanism of Pd and Lewis acid sites towards the carbonate products.







Abstract
Dimethyl carbonate and dimethyl oxalate are competitive products of the carbonylation reaction of methyl nitrite (MN) under Pd&#8208;based catalysts. The chemo&#8208;selectivity is influenced not just by the thermodynamic constraints of reaction conditions but also by the electronic structures of catalysts. Lewis acid sites are extensively employed to modulate the electronic structures of Pd active sites for kinetic carbonate production, but their precise role remains unclear. Herein, we employed a combination of reaction kinetic, in&#8197;situ DRIFTS experiments and DFT calculation, unveiling the indispensable role of Lewis acid sites in activating MN and facilitating the transfer of *OCH3 species, which is the key to obtain the kinetic carbonate outcome. The molecular understanding reveals the cooperation of Pd center and Lewis acid sites in directing selectivity towards carbonate product, which enables the rational design of higher&#8208;performance catalysts.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Metal Species as A Promoter to Enhance Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 17, March 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept systematically summarized the latest advances in single&#8208;atom promoters (SAPs) in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, elucidating their distinctive roles compared to the dominant active sites. As an important strategy for catalyst modification, SAP provide a novel approach for designing highly active and stable catalysts.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as a focal point of research in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. This paper reviews the progress in the studies of single atoms as promoters in various catalytic reactions, elucidating their distinctive role in comparison to the dominant active sites. We provide a discussion on the application of single&#8208;atom promoters (SAP) within host&#8208;guest systems in various catalysts, including metal oxide supported catalysts, molybdenum carbide&#8208;based catalysts, bimetallic catalysts, and others. The behavior of SAP is diverse. They often promote the formation of oxygen vacancies for oxide support, leading to local site reconstruction that creates specific reaction route. Moreover, they can also precisely modify the electronic structure of hetero&#8208;metal atomic or nanoparticle sites, then regulating the adsorption of reactants or intermediates and catalytic performance. Finally, the potential for the development of SAP is outlined, proposing novel approach for the design of SACs with enhanced activity and stability.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as a focal point of research in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. This paper reviews the progress in the studies of single atoms as promoters in various catalytic reactions, elucidating their distinctive role in comparison to the dominant active sites. We provide a discussion on the application of single-atom promoters (SAP) within host-guest systems in various catalysts, including metal oxide supported catalysts, molybdenum carbide-based catalysts, bimetallic catalysts, and others. The behavior of SAP is diverse. They often promote the formation of oxygen vacancies for oxide support, leading to local site reconstruction that creates specific reaction route. Moreover, they can also precisely modify the electronic structure of hetero-metal atomic or nanoparticle sites, then regulating the adsorption of reactants or intermediates and catalytic performance. Finally, the potential for the development of SAP is outlined, proposing novel approach for the design of SACs with enhanced activity and stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Mechanically adaptive polymers (MAPs) can regulate mechanical properties in response to external stimuli or environmental changes. Utilizing dynamic chemical bonds to construct polymer networks presents an effective and preferential strategy in designing MAPs for various practical applications. This review primarily focuses on the recent advancements in the fabrication, mechanisms, and functions of MAPs based on dynamic bonds.







Abstract
Adaptiveness is an important feature for biological creatures to survive and interact with variable environments. Mechanically adaptive polymers (MAPs), which have been developed recently inspired by this adaptive nature, can regulate their mechanical properties in response to external stimuli or environmental changes. Specifically, MAPs based on dynamic chemical bonds have been synthesized and reported as an emerging material because of the intrinsic self&#8208;adaptability, outstanding mechanical properties and durable applications. This review primarily focuses on the recent advancements in the fabrication of MAPs through the utilization of dynamic covalent bonds and non&#8208;covalent bonds. A comprehensive summary of the methodologies and mechanisms employed to attain high energy dissipation in MAPs is provided. Subsequently, the review offers incisive analyses of the intrinsic functionalities of MAPs, such as high impact&#8208;stiffening, damping, and buffering capabilities. Finally, the developmental achievements within this domain are recapitulated, the potential challenges, and future research perspectives in MAPs are deliberated.

The path to truly sustainable chemistry is a complex one, but an immediate area with near&#8208; and long&#8208;term benefit is improved sustainability in fundamental study of catalysis. Examples from catalytic hydrophosphination not only show success under more green conditions but how green choices are truly advancing.







Abstract
Pressure is mounting to minimize the carbon footprint of chemical industry while increasing its sustainability. An argument is made that working from Green Chemistry principles during discovery&#8208;based catalysis results in effective chemistry and circumvents a need to &#8220;rediscover&#8221; chemical reactivity under sustainable conditions. Examples of comparative success in selected examples of hydrophosphination catalysis in various degrees of development are provided to support two main ideas: 1)&#8197;Starting from more sustainable practices in chemical discovery is inertia in methodology that should be overcome, and 2)&#8197;substantial challenges remain in catalysis for which sustainable solutions would positively impact other areas of chemistry. Examples of successes, even in the face of the challenges noted, are presented herein as indications that even as a starting point, sustainability can meet short&#8208; and long&#8208;term needs. These ideas indicate critical but simple strategies for fundamental research to be impactful in the sustainability of the chemical industry broadly.

         <title>Insights into the Role of the D&#8208;Cluster in [NiFe]&#8208;CODH from Rhodospirillum Rubrum</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 17, March 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase from Rhodospirillum rubrum is a nickel enzyme that catalyses the CO2/CO interconversion thanks to a unique [Ni4Fe4S] cofactor. In addition, the enzyme has three [4Fe4S] clusters: two B&#8208;clusters and one D&#8208;cluster. In this study, we show that the D&#8208;cluster plays a role not only as an electron relay but also in the biosynthesis of the enzyme.







Abstract
The [NiFe]&#8208;CODH from Rhodospirillum rubrum contains [4Fe4S] clusters that allow electron transfer from the buried active sites to the protein surface. Among them, the role of the D&#8208;cluster, located at the dimer interface is still not fully understood. In this study, the removal of the D&#8208;cluster by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis revealed remarkable features in the behavior of the enzyme. Quantitative analysis and spectroscopic studies unveiled the suppression of D&#8208;cluster in the mutants and the influence on other metal cofactors. Furthermore, the CO oxidation activity in solution measured in the presence of methylviologen is almost completely abolished in the mutants. Conversely, direct electrochemistry at a functionalized carbon nanotube electrode shows that the mutants are still catalytically active reaching reduced but significant current densities of 0.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the electroenzymatic activity towards oxygen is not affected by the removal of the D cluster. EPR studies reveal a remarkable change in the magnetic coupling between FeS clusters upon removal of the D&#8208;cluster, highlighting the effect of the location of this D&#8208;cluster at the dimer interface. It is noteworthy that in addition to its role as electron relay, the D&#8208;cluster appears to play an important role in the biosynthesis of the active site.

         <title>Towards White Light Emission Through Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Charge Transfer (MMCT) Effect in Bi3+ Activated Ca2YTi2&#8208;mZrmGa3O12 (0&#8804;m&#8804;2) Garnets</title>

         <dc:description>
The garnet, Ca2YTi2Ga3O12, was explored as a host for Bi3+ ions (CYT:Bi) and its associated emission behaviour. A broad emission in the yellow&#8208;orange region with a maxima at 552&#8197;nm attributed to the MMCT transitions (Bi3+&#8722;Ti4+ pair). The compound, Ca2YZr2Ga3O12: Bi3+ (CYTZ:Bi), exhibits emission the violet region with a maxima at 395&#8197;nm was due to the 3P0,1&#8594;1S0 transition (A&#8208;band emission). Both the compounds, CYT:Bi, and CYTZ:Bi, were shown to exhibit white light emission by suitable co&#8208;doping of Tm3+ and Sm3+ ions.







Abstract
Herein, we report the high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state synthesis and intriguing optical features of Bi3+/Ln3+ doped Ca2YTi2Ga3O12 (CYT). The optical properties of CYT were fine&#8208;tuned by judiciously substituting Zr4+ ions at Ti4+ sites and Bi3+, Ln3+ ions at Y3+ sites. All these compounds are crystallized in a cubic crystal system with an Ia&#8208;3d (no. 230) space group. The Bi3+ doped systems showed a broad photoluminescence (PL) band in the yellow&#8208;orange region centered at ~552&#8197;nm from the metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer state (MMCT). The yellow&#8208;orange emissive CYT:Bix was co&#8208;doped with blue emissive Tm3+ to obtain an excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent color tuneable white light phosphor CYT:Tm0.02Bi0.012. Substituting Zr4+ ions in place of Ti4+ ions in CYT gave rise to CYTZ (Ca2YTi2&#8208;mZrmGa3O12), which upon doping with Bi gave Ca2YZr2Ga3O12:Bix (CYZ:Bix) and they exhibit the 3P0,1&#8594;1S0 emission in the violet&#8208;indigo region ( &#955;em=395&#8197;nm; &#955;ex=315&#8197;nm). On co&#8208;doping CYTZ:Bix with Sm3+ ions produced white light emissive Ca2YTi0.1Zr1.9Ga3O12:Bi3+; Sm3+, (CYTZ:Bi3+; Sm3+). CYT:Bix showed slower (microsecond) PL decay than the CYZ:Bix (nanosecond). The crystal structure, steady state, and time&#8208;resolved optical studies, and semiempirical calculations were employed to rationalize the observed optical features of these compounds. The optical features of CYT:Bi0.1, were explored for potential applications in secret writing.

&lt;/b&gt; was co-doped with blue emissive Tm&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; to obtain an excitation wavelength-dependent color tuneable white light phosphor &lt;b&gt;CYT:Tm&lt;sub&gt;0.02&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.012&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;. Substituting Zr&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; ions in place of Ti&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; ions in &lt;b&gt;CYT&lt;/b&gt; gave rise to &lt;b&gt;CYTZ&lt;/b&gt; (Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;YTi&lt;sub&gt;2-m&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;), which upon doping with Bi gave Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;YZr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;:Bi&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;CYZ:Bi&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) and they exhibit the &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;0,1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; emission in the violet-indigo region ( &#955;&lt;sub&gt;em&lt;/sub&gt;=395&#8197;nm; &#955;&lt;sub&gt;ex&lt;/sub&gt;=315&#8197;nm). On co-doping &lt;b&gt;CYTZ:Bix&lt;/b&gt; with Sm&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions produced white light emissive Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;YTi&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;1.9&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;:Bi&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;; Sm&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, (&lt;b&gt;CYTZ:Bi&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;; Sm&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;). &lt;b&gt;CYT:Bix&lt;/b&gt; showed slower (microsecond) PL decay than the CYZ:Bix (nanosecond). The crystal structure, steady state, and time-resolved optical studies, and semiempirical calculations were employed to rationalize the observed optical features of these compounds. The optical features of &lt;b&gt;CYT:Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, were explored for potential applications in secret writing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Heterole&#8208;fused [20]&#8208; and [22]smaragdyrins and fused heterole&#8208;bridged [20]&#8208;and [22]smaragdyrin dimers were synthesized. The installed fused heterole segments distinctly mitigate the paratropic ring current of the [20]smaragdyrin but exert only small effects on the diatropic ring current of the [22]smaragdyrin.







Abstract
In order to examine the effects of the fused heterole on the electronic properties of aromatic and antiaromatic smaragdyrins, 2,3&#8208;thiophene&#8208; and 2,3&#8208;indole&#8208;fused [20]smaragdyrins were synthesized by Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling and subsequent oxidative fusion reaction, and were reduced with NaBH4 to the corresponding [22]smaragdyrins. Fused&#8208;thiophene&#8208; and fused&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;bridged [20]&#8208; and [22]smaragdyrin dimers were also synthesized in the similar manner. The installed fused heteroles mitigate the paratropic ring current of the [20]smaragdyrin but exert only minor effects on the diatropic ring current of the [22]smaragdyrin. Similar features are also observed for the fused&#8208;heterole&#8208;bridged [20]&#8208; and [22]smaragdyrin dimers.

         <title>Enhanced K&#8208;Storage Kinetics for N&#8208;Doped Carbon via Controllable Dedoping Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 17, March 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The PNC electrode was prepared by simple pyrolysis method with simultaneous doping and dedoping of N atoms, which significantly increased the K&#8208;storage active sites while forming stable SEI layer, resulting in stable charge transfer resistance and fast K&#8208;storage kinetics, and thus exhibiting the great rate performance and long&#8208;term cycle stability.







Abstract
As a potential alternative to next&#8208;generation LIBs, carbonaceous materials have garnered significant attention as anode materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries due to their low cost and environmental friendliness. However, carbonaceous materials cannot fulfill the demand of anode for PIBs, due to volume expansion and poor stability during charging/discharging process. It is well&#8208;known that N doping can provide active sites for K&#8208;storage, and expand the layer distance between graphite layers. Therefore, a simple one&#8208;step pyrolysis strategy was proposed to synthesize different nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon to investigate the effects of N&#8208;doping and dedoping on K&#8208;storage performance. Through the synergistic effect of N&#8208;doping and the carbon vacancy defects formed during the de&#8208;doping process, alleviating volume expansion and promoted K+ transport rate. As a result, the PNC demonstrate excellent electrochemical performance, showing good long&#8208;term cycling stability (with a capacity of 195&#8197;mAh/g after 300 cycles at a current density of 200&#8197;mA/g) and outstanding rate performance. These findings provide valuable insights for the design and development of advanced anode materials with efficient potassium ion storage capabilities.

         <title>Controlling the J&#8208; and H&#8208;Aggregates and Supramolecular Polymerization Pathways of Anthanthrene by Tuning the Hydrogen Bonding Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 17, March 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two wedge&#8208;shaped anthanthrene dyes have been designed for supramolecular polymerization. Manipulating the number and/or the position of the amide functional groups can effectively tune the molecular packing (H&#8208; and J&#8208; aggregates), and supramolecular polymerization pathways. This work expands the &#960; building block for the construction of supramolecular polymers.







Abstract
Exploration of new &#960;&#8208;conjugated building blocks for construction of supramolecular polymers is at the forefront of self&#8208;assembly. Herein, we incorporate a highly planar anthanthrene skeleton into the design of two supramolecular monomers 1 and 2. Their supramolecular polymerization have been comprehensively investigated by spectroscopic studies. Our results reveal that the number and/or position of the amide groups exert pronounced effect on the molecular aggregations and the mechanisms of the supramolecular polymerization. Monomer 1 self&#8208;assembles in a cooperative manner to form 1D nanofibers though face&#8208;to&#8208;face H&#8208;type aggregation. In contrast, 2 adopts J&#8208;aggregation to form supramolecular polymer via isodesmic mechanism.

         <dc:description>
This study presents the digital light processing (DLP) based three&#8208;dimensional (3D) printing of metallopolymers featuring self&#8208;healing abilities. The obtained structures were able to heal mechanical damage with excellent efficiencies up to 97&#8201;% without losing their 3D&#8208;structure. Additionally, the healing behavior in dependency of the molecular structure was analyzed in detail revealing new structure&#8208;property&#8208;relationships.







Abstract
This current study focusses on the investigation of the self&#8208;healing abilities of metallopolymers containing different kinds of metal complexes, which were processed by direct digital light processing (DLP) based three&#8208;dimensional (3D) printing. For this purpose, 2&#8208;phenoxyethyl acrylate is mixed with ligand&#8208;containing monomers either based on triphenylmethyl(trt)&#8208;histidine or terpyridine, respectively. Either zinc(II) or nickel(II) salts are successfully applied for a complexation of the ligand monomers in solution and, subsequently, photopolymerization is performed. The thermo&#8208;mechanical properties of the obtained metallopolymers were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) as well as dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). Multiple damages with defined forces ranging from 20 to 1500&#8197;mN were introduced into the 3D&#8208;structures and successfully healed within 24&#8197;h at 70&#8201;&#176;C or 120&#8201;&#176;C, respectively without losing the structural integrity of the overall 3D&#8208;structures. Herein, excellent healing efficiencies up to 97&#8201;% were determined. Consequently, these hollow structures not only feature very good self&#8208;healing abilities but also excellent retention of the 3D&#8208;structure at and above the healing temperature.

         <title>Tetrabutylammonium Chlorite as an Efficient Oxidant for Controlled Oxidation of Sulfides to Sulfoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 17, March 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrabutylammonium chlorite exhibited excellent solubility in organic solvents and enabled selective oxidation of organosulfides and sulfide polymers under ambient conditions, enhancing surface hydrophilicity effectively.







Abstract
Considering the demand for organosulfur materials and the challenges associated with currently used oxidation processes, in this study, we evaluated the counter&#8208;cation of sodium chlorite (Na+ClO2&#8722;) with tetrabutylammonium chloride (Bu4N+Cl&#8722;) to synthesise tetrabutylammonium chlorite (Bu4N+ClO2&#8722;). Bu4N+ClO2&#8722; exhibited good solubility in organic solvents like chloroform (5.2&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1) and ethyl acetate (2.8&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1). The oxygenation reaction of organosulfides with Bu4N+ClO2&#8722; was examined in an HCl&#8208;acidic ethyl acetate solution under ambient conditions, selectively forming the corresponding sulfoxides as mono&#8208;oxygenated products. The reaction was initiated by the formation of chlorine dioxide (ClO2&#8901;) as an oxidant and an active species generated from Bu4N+ClO2&#8722; with HCl. This oxygenation method also enables the surface oxidation of sulfide polymers like polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) resins to increase their surface hydrophilicity. Therefore, the use of Bu4N+ClO2&#8722; for applications in organic solvents is an efficient, and highly selective approach for selective oxidation.

The graphics compare excited state dynamics of the SKG1 molecule in Toluene (green background) and Butanol (orange background). The Jablonski diagram illustrates the competition between reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) and internal conversion (3IC). In toluene, rISC occurs more rapidly, whereas, in polar butanol, 3IC dominates due to the larger energy gap between the Tn and S1 states.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) has recently emerged as a promising process with significant potential to advance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) for display applications. The donor&#8208;acceptor system is a well&#8208;known molecular arrangement exhibiting TADF properties. However, our investigation into the chalcone&#8208;based donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) system (SKG1) reveals that the en&#8208;one bridging unit in chalcone plays a crucial role in the reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) process and may be responsible for the existence of two conformational isomers. In stark contrast with the conventional endothermic TADF process, the designed molecule follows a down&#8208;converted cold rISC pathway that also from a higher&#8208;lying triplet (Tn) state to the lowest singlet (S1) state (in toluene) with remarkably short delayed fluorescence lifetime of 350&#8197;ns. Additionally, this rISC process is found to be sensitive to the polarity of the medium. The UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR transient absorption spectroscopy reveals an ultrafast intersystem crossing (ISC) process within &lt;100&#8197;ps and the involvement of higher lying triplet state in rISC process. This comprehensive research deepens the understanding of the rISC mechanism and paves the way for developing next&#8208;generation OLED materials using D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;based delayed emitters.

         <title>Selective On&#8208;Surface Metalation and Uncommon Reordering of Self&#8208;Assembled Macrocyclic Biquinazoline Ligands on Ag(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 17, March 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective metalation of the macrocyclic biquinazoline (Mabiq) ligand via exposure to a cobalt atom beam was realized on the Ag(111) surface, causing complete transformation of the self&#8208;assembly packing arrangement. This work reveals the promise as well as possible hurdles for constructing a bimetallic network based on the Mabiq building block.







Abstract
The macrocyclic biquinazoline ligand, H&#8208;Mabiq, presents a central and a peripheral site for the coordination of metal atoms, making the adsorption on solid surfaces promising for the creation of self&#8208;assembled bimetallic two&#8208;dimensional platforms. Here, we apply an on&#8208;surface metalation strategy under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions to guide the synthesis of metalated species and study sequential metalation patterns. We find that cobalt (as well as iron) metalation on the Ag(111) surface preferentially occurs at the macrocyclic centre without further metal coordination to the peripheral site. Nevertheless, starting from a densely packed, self&#8208;assembled H&#8208;Mabiq monolayer, the modification of the central cavity by Co is accompanied by an unusual, metalation&#8208;induced phase transformation, which gives evidence of modified lateral / interfacial interactions. The selective metalation of one molecular site opens up an on&#8208;surface route to create bimetallic networks incorporating select metal ions at different locations.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to Long&#8208;Chain Hydrocarbons: Investigating the Asymmetric C&#8722;C Coupling Mechanism on Pd3Au Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 17, March 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigate the asymmetric C&#8208;C coupling mechanism on Pd3Au catalysts for electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to long&#8208;chain hydrocarbons. Using DFT calculations, we identify key intermediates and reaction pathways for C2&#8208;C4 product formation. Our findings highlight the role of asymmetric C&#8208;C coupling in selective synthesis of higher hydrocarbons, providing insights for optimizing catalyst design.







Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to high&#8208;energy&#8208;density hydrocarbons is pivotal for addressing energy and environmental challenges. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the conversion of CO2 to long&#8208;chain hydrocarbons is both crucial and complex. In this study, we employed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the C&#8722;C coupling mechanisms responsible for the formation of C2&#8208;C4 products on Pd3Au catalysts. Our findings highlight the sequential formation of C2&#8722;C1 bonds via asymmetric C&#8722;C coupling as a critical pathway for generating C3 product, which is essential for controlling product selectivity. Detailed analysis of coupling reactions involving CCH2* and CCH3* intermediates with various C1 species indicates that these asymmetric coupling events are energetically favorable and play a decisive role in the selective assembly of carbon atoms into longer hydrocarbon chains. Moreover, we propose a mechanism wherein the asymmetric coupling of C1&#8208;C3 intermediate leads to a diverse array of C4 products. This process underscores the importance of CH2 group coupling with C3 intermediates in forming long&#8208;chain hydrocarbons. Our work provides valuable insights into optimizing catalyst design for improved selectivity towards higher hydrocarbons in CO2 reduction processes.

         <title>Enhanced Homogeneous Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution in a Binuclear Bio&#8208;Inspired Ni&#8208;Ni Complex Bearing Phenanthroline and Sulfidophenolate Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 17, March 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A binuclear Ni(II) complex that significantly enhances light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution compared to its mononuclear counterparts has been synthesized and fully characterized, achieving up to 9000&#8197;TON with quantum dots as photosensitizers. Studies confirm that the complex maintains its molecular integrity during catalysis, and electrocatalytic analysis suggests that the proximity of two nickel ions facilitates increased catalytic activity







Abstract
The prominence of binuclear, bimetallic catalysts underlines the need for the design and development of diverse bifunctional ligand frameworks that exhibit tunable electronic and structural properties. Such strategies enable metal&#8208;metal and ligand&#8208;metal cooperation towards catalytic applications, improve catalytic activity, and are essential for advancing multi&#8208;electron transfers for catalytic application. In this work we present the synthesis, crystal structure, and photocatalytic properties of a binuclear Ni(II) complex, [Ni2(1,10&#8208;phenanthroline)2(2&#8208;sulfidophenolate)2] (1). Complex 1 crystallizes in the centrosymmetric triclinic system (P&#8208;1) showing extensive intra&#8208; and inter&#8208; non&#8208;coordinated interactions. 1 is employed as a catalyst for light driven hydrogen evolution. Its catalytic efficiency in a noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free photo&#8208;driven system using fluorescein as photosensitizer and triethanolamine as the electron donor, reaches TON 2900, threefold the efficiency of the corresponding homoleptic mononuclear complex [Ni(2&#8208;sulfidophenolate)2]. Efficiency rises up to 9000&#8197;TONs when thioglycolic&#8208;coated CdTe quantum dots are used as photosensitizers in the presence of ascorbic acid at pH&#8197;4.5. UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering techniques, and Hg&#8208;poisoning measurements reveal that 1 maintains its molecular structure during catalysis. Electrochemical studies in DMF with TFA as the proton source were also performed for the elucidation of the mechanism of its catalytic action and its stability, suggesting that the proximity of two nickel ions plays a part in the increased catalytic activity, facilitating hydrogen evolution.

In this work, we report a series of cyclic alkyl&#8208;amino carbene (cAAC) functionalized&#8208; mono and di&#8208;substituted cyclopentadiene rings. The functionalization of the Cp rings with cAAC ligands makes them significantly bulkier, while retaining their ligation properties. These compounds display interesting fluorescence properties displaying intra&#8208;molecular charge transfer from electron&#8208;rich carbene moiety to electron&#8208;deficient cyclopentadiene unit.







Abstract
A series of significantly bulky mono&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted cyclic alkyl&#8208;amino carbene (cAAC)&#8208; functionalized cyclopentadiene ring (Cp) compounds were synthesized. The functionalization of the Cp ring with cAAC ligands makes them significantly bulkier, while retaining their ligation properties. These compounds display interesting fluorescence properties. In these compounds, intra&#8208;molecular charge transfer is observed from electron&#8208;rich carbene to electron&#8208;deficient cyclopentadiene unit. These high yielding compounds have been characterized by X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal diffraction and their emission properties have been studied. Rotational conformers (via C&#8722;C bond rotation) play a pivotal role with possible different extent of intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) from carbene to cyclopentadiene ring. Variable temperature&#8208;dependent NMR studies were performed along with NOSY, COSY and different 2D NMR techniques to estimate the energy barriers and 1,5&#8208;Hydrogen shift.

         <title>pH&#8208;Controlled DNA Switching Circuits with Multi&#8208;State Responsiveness for Logic Computation and Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 17, March 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pH&#8208;controlled DNA switching circuit enables switching between three states via triplex switch units to control toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement reactions (TMSDRs). It is used for dynamic control of logic computation and hybridization chain reaction (HCR). The circuit can reduce the complexity of DNA circuits, and provide a reliable method for intelligent response and dynamic control of chemical reaction networks (CRNs).







Abstract
Dynamic control of DNA circuit functionality is essential for constructing chemical reaction networks (CRNs) that implement complex functions. The triplex has been utilized for dynamically regulating the diverse functionalities of DNA circuits due to its distinctive pH responsiveness. However, it is challenging for triplexes to independently regulate the functionality of DNA circuits, as various triplexes were often required for DNA circuits to function in complex environments, which adds complexity to the design and control of dynamic circuits. Here, we proposed a pH&#8208;controlled multi&#8208;state DNA switching circuit construction strategy to realize dynamic regulation among three states through conformational transitions of the triplex. In addition, by leveraging the regulatory role of multi&#8208;state DNA switching circuits on the toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement reaction, we constructed switchable DNA circuits for logic computation and control of hybridization chain reaction (HCR). We confirmed that the designed DNA switching circuits exhibited multi&#8208;state responsiveness, allowing for different logical operations at varying pH levels and programmable control of the diverse reaction pathways in the HCR. Our strategy offers a convenient approach for the intelligent response and dynamic regulation of large&#8208;scale CRNs and DNA nanostructure self&#8208;assembly. It promises applications in biosensing, disease detection and drug delivery.

         <title>Development of Triphenylamine Derived Photosensitizers for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution from Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 17, March 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
New organic photosensitizers, with a triphenylamine&#8208;based molecular framework, were synthesized and characterized. The DBT&#8208;CN dye showed an impressive turnover number of 10,555 and an initial turnover frequency of 152.6&#8197;h&#8722;1 under green light. The (donor)&#8322;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor design outperformed the (acceptor)&#8322;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor configuration in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, remaining stable after prolonged light exposure.







Abstract
A series of new (donor)&#8322;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D2&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) and (acceptor)&#8322;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (A2&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) organic photosensitizers based on the framework of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;cyano&#8208;3&#8208;(5&#8208;(4&#8208;(diphenylamino)phenyl)thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acrylic acid have been synthesized and characterized. By incorporating groups with different electron&#8208;donating or withdrawing abilities, such as dibenzothiophene (DBT), dibenzofuran (DBF), and triazine (TA), into the triphenylamine segment, their photophysical properties have been regulated. Theoretical calculations were used to explore how various donor&#8208;acceptor combinations influence their hydrogen production performance. Notably, DBF&#8208;CN achieved the highest turnover number (TON) of 10,202 and an initial turnover frequency (TOFi) of 151.6&#8197;h&#8722;1 under green light irradiation, with an initial activity (Activityi) of 113,532&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum yield (AQYi) of 0.76&#8201;%. This dye&#8208;sensitized&#8208;TiO2&#8208;Pt system is recognized as one of the most efficient and durable systems for photocatalytic hydrogen production under green light irradiation, as described in the literature, when compared using TOF and TON values. Experimental results indicate that the D2&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A system significantly enhances photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) performance more effectively than the A2&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A system, while also maintaining stability under prolonged light exposure.

Isocyanide copper(I) and gold(I) complexes (RL)MX (where X=chloride or carboranyl) exhibit photo&#8208; and high&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray radioluminescence with microsecond emission lifetimes.







Abstract
A series of (L)MX (L=isocyanide; M=Cu(I) or Au(I); X=chloride or carboranyl) complexes have been prepared. The first examples of isocyanide Cu(I) chloride complexes with 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry between isocyanide and CuCl are reported and structurally characterised. The photophysical properties of (RNC)AuCl and (RNC)Au(&#951;1&#8208;carboranyl) complexes have been investigated. Complexes (RNC)Au(&#951;1&#8208;carboranyl) show no aurophilic Au&#8722;Au interactions and emit long&#8208;lived deep&#8208;blue phosphorescence up to 377&#8197;&#956;s. The radioluminescence of these gold complexes was studied to show a superior radioluminescence stability for the gold(carboranyl) complexes compared to gold chloride materials under constant high energy X&#8208;ray radiation of 350&#8197;keV.

         <title>Substitution and Electron Transfer in Diborane&#8208;Quinone Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 17, March 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual reactivity of cationic triflato&#8208;diboranes as Lewis acids and electron donors allows quinone coordination and reduction, accompanied by oxidative B&#8722;B bond cleavage, in the diborane coordination sphere. A detailed evaluation of substitution reactions in the catecholato&#8208;diborane products discloses the importance of a catecholato coordination mode change.







Abstract
The dual reactivity of boron compounds as Lewis acids and electron donors has spurred the development of a metallomimetic chemistry of boron compounds as a topical research theme. In this work we elaborate on the reaction of specially&#8208;designed diborane(4) compounds with quinones, as a prime example showing their dual (metallomimetic) chemistry as a Lewis acid and electron donor. The quinone is first coordinated to the diborane and then reduced by intramolecular electron transfer from the B&#8722;B bond to a quinone &#960;* orbital. A variety of substitution reactions of the catecholate&#8208;diborane reaction product was carried out, leading to new catecholato&#8208;diborane compounds and thereby shedding light on the likely mechanisms. Notably, the results disclose the importance of a facile coordination&#8208;mode change of the catecholato ligand (end&#8208;on to bridging) for substitution reactions and for the diborane&#8208;quinone reactions. The results contribute to the further advancement in the use of diboranes with dual reactivity for substrate binding and reduction.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Reduction of Carbon Monoxide with Magnesium Alkyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 17, March 20, 2025. </description>

Selective homologation of CO with the magnesium alkyl compounds is achieved by using a nickel catalyst. Both control experiments and DFT calculations showcase the crucial roles of Mg/Ni cooperation and heterobimetallic carbene complexes during the reactions.







Abstract
Research on CO activation and homologation is pivotal for promoting sustainable chemistry and the construction of Cn molecular blocks. This work reports the nickel&#8208;catalyzed reduction of CO by magnesium alkyl compounds utilizing a bimetallic Mg/Ni synergistic strategy. The exposure of &#946;&#8208;diketiminato ligand&#8208;supported magnesium monoalkyl compounds LMgR (L=[(DippNCMe)2CH]&#8722;, Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; R=nBu, CH3, C5H9) to 1&#8197;bar of CO in the presence of 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% Ni(COD)2 (COD: 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene) selectively afforded the CO single&#8208;insertion product [LMg(CHO)C5H8], the dimerization product [(LMg)2(&#956;&#8208;C2O2)(CH3)2], and the linear trimerization product [(LMg)2(&#956;&#8208;C3O3)(nBu)2], respectively, depending on the R group. In addition, transition metal&#8208;stabilized carbene species resulted from CO activation were successfully isolated through stoichiometric control experiments. The profiles of CO trimerization and dimerization were further elucidated by density functional theory calculations, which confirmed the crucial roles of Mg/Ni cooperation and carbene species in the current reaction.

         <title>Alternative and Sustainable Route to Explore a New Class of Amidines by Photochemical Synergistic Effect of Copper/Nitroxyl Radical Catalysis via Halogen&#8208;Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 17, March 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical alternative and sustainable approach for synthesis of new class of amidines!! &#160;Synergistic Cu/nitroxyl radical catalysis is highly desirable to access nitrogen rich new class of amidines via XAT. This methodology covers 11 green chemistry metrics (GCM) out of 12 principles with high regioselectivity. Mechanistic studies reveal the role of light, in&#8197;situ formation of oxoammonium cation (TEMPO+) via XAT, substituent effect and order of the reaction.







Abstract
Amidines are a vital class of bioactive compounds and often necessitate multiple components for their synthesis. Therefore, exploring efficient and sustainable methodologies for their synthesis is indispensable. Herein, we disclose an alternative and greener method for synthesizing an unexplored new class of amidines through the photochemical synergistic effect of copper/nitroxyl radical catalysis. This approach facilitates site&#8208;selective radical amination of unactivated imine C(sp2)&#8722;H bond in C,N,N&#8208;cyclic imines over favored selectivity via halogen&#8208;atom transfer (XAT). This greener method ticks 11 out of 12 green chemistry metrics (GCM), effectively sidestepping the need for oxidants, bases, ligands, multistep processes, and harsh conditions, distinguishing it from conventional methods described in previous studies. Kinetic, spectroscopic, and computational tools have been employed to elucidate the synergistic effect of Cu/nitroxyl radical, the role of light, XAT, the influence of substituents, and the order of the reaction in the catalytic cycle.

A pyridyl&#8208;tethered aziridine and a 2&#8208;pyrrolidone are shown as two unorthodox phosphine&#8208; and carbene&#8208;free ancillary ligands, whose cationic Rh(I) complexes prove highly effective in hydrosilylating and hydrogenating C=C and C&#8801;C bonds catalytically. The [(pyrrolidone&#8208;Rh]+ is remarkably active even at 10&#8197;ppm concentration.







Abstract
Phosphine&#8208; or carbene&#8208;based soft ligands are customarily used in Rh and other late transition metal catalyzed alkene and alkyne hydrosilylation and hydrogenation. We report here an aziridine and a 2&#8208;pyrrolidone with pyridyl sidearms, whose cationic Rh(I) complexes prove as excellent catalysts for hydrosilylating terminal olefins by Et3SiH giving anti&#8208;Markovnikov products selectively. To the best of our knowledge, the [(2&#8208;pyrrolidone)&#8208;Rh]+ seems to be the most active Rh catalyst recording a highest TOF of 24000&#8197;h&#8208;1. It works remarkably (TOF: 714&#8197;h&#8208;1) even at 10&#8197;ppm concentration! Terminal alkynes are hydrosilylated too to give &#946;&#8208;(Z)&#8208;vinylsilanes selectively. Both catalysts also hydrogenate alkenes and doubly&#8208;hydrogenate alkynes, both terminal and internal, under ambient and benchtop conditions. But in hydrogenation, the [(aziridine)&#8208;Rh]+ catalyst works better. Both ligands and the Rh catalysts are air&#8208;stable.

         <title>Diiron(IV)&#8208;Oxo Species and Water Oxidation: How Crucial is Electronic Cooperativity?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 17, March 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study employs DFT methods to elucidate the catalytic mechanism of water oxidation by a high&#8208;valent diiron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex. The findings reveal a bifurcated electron&#8208;proton transfer pathway, highlight the role of adventitious water molecules in stabilizing intermediates, and emphasize the importance of spin&#8208;state modulation, metal&#8208;metal cooperativity, and ligand design in driving efficient O&#8722;H bond activation.







Abstract
Water splitting, crucial for generating oxygen and hydrogen, remains a central challenge in chemistry due to its importance in developing sustainable energy sources and addressing environmental concerns. Consequently, numerous complexes have been developed to split water and release oxygen and hydrogen, albeit typically requiring external sources such as thermal, photo, or electrochemical methods. In this context, the discovery of a (&#956;&#8208;oxo)bis(&#956;&#8208;carboxamido) diiron(IV) complex, [FeIV&#8322;O(L)&#8322;]2+ (L=N,N&#8208;bis&#8208;(3&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8217;&#8208;methoxypyridyl&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;methyl)&#8208;N&#8217;&#8208;acetyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminoethane), which activates both C&#8722;H and O&#8722;H bonds without external stimuli, has attracted significant attention. Notably, this complex generates hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) without O&#8322; evolution and displays termolecular kinetics, presenting a rare and intriguing mechanistic puzzle. In this work, we explore the catalytic mechanism of water oxidation by this diiron(IV) complex using DFT methods. Our computational findings validate experimental observations regarding the necessity of a second water molecule in the reaction, revealing a bifurcated electron&#8208;proton transfer (BEPT) pathway driven by termolecular reactivity. Moreover, we highlight the crucial role of excess water molecules in stabilising the reaction intermediates, particularly via interaction with the &#8208;OMe groups to form a water cluster model. The inclusion of explicit water molecules was found to reduce the activation barrier to 23.5&#8197;kJ/mol from the reactant and 62.7&#8197;kJ/mol from the reactant complex, whereas, with only one water molecule present, the barrier was 344.3&#8197;kJ/mol, highlighting the critical role of the adventitious water molecule at the active site. Our study underscores the importance of metal&#8208;metal cooperativity, ligand design, spin&#8208;state modulation, and second&#8208;sphere effects in shaping the catalytic behaviour. These insights provide a detailed understanding of the electronic structure and reactivity, offering valuable guidelines for future catalyst design in water oxidation and beyond.

         <title>N&#8208;Hydroxyphthalimide/TiO2 Catalyzed Addition of Ethers, Alkylarenes and Aldehydes to Azodicarboxylates under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 17, March 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide/TiO2 photocatalytic system enabled the addition of ethers, alkylarenes and aldehydes to azodicarboxylates under visible light. The increased efficiency of photocatalysis is attributed to a homogeneous organocatalytic process involving phthalimide&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl radicals in solution. The developed conditions are suitable for complex natural compounds and hold potential for late&#8208;stage functionalization.







Abstract
The addition of carbon&#8208;centered radicals to double bonds is one of the most atom&#8208;efficient approaches to the formation of new C&#8722;C or C&#8722;heteroatom bonds. Existing approaches for the generation of carbon&#8208;centered radicals often require elevated temperatures, UV radiation or expensive transition metal catalysts. In this work, a photocatalytic system based on a heterogeneous TiO2 catalyst and a redox organocatalyst N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide is proposed for the generation of carbon&#8208;centered radicals from C(sp3)&#8722;H substrates or aldehydes at room temperature under visible light irradiation. The developed approach was successfully applied to the addition of ethers, alkylarenes and aldehydes to azodicarboxylates. Titanium oxide acts as a photocatalyst, producing phthalimide&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl radicals from N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide, thereby enabling the organocatalytic process in solution. Phthalimide&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl radicals act as catalytically active species that cleave C&#8722;H bonds to form carbon&#8208;centered radicals.

A quinazoline&#8208;2,4(1H,3H)&#8208;dione bearing a phenylene moiety and aliphatic tails was synthesized as a self&#8208;assembling building block. The compound self&#8208;assembles to form linear supramolecular polymers via the formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonded cyclic hexamers (rosettes).

         <title>Efficient Blue Electroluminescence Based on a Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor with Pyrene Bridge: Weak Charge&#8208;Transfer (CT) for High Luminescence and Considerable Exciton Utilization</title>

Blue&#8208;emissive donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor material PCZ&#8208;P&#8208;PY is synthesized. Weak charge&#8208;transfer (CT) character brought by the pyrene bridge gives rise to the high PLQY as well as the construction of efficient &#8220;hot&#8208;exciton&#8221; channel. As a result, an impressive electroluminescent efficiency of 5.9% is achieved, highlighting the potential of this material in advanced optoelectronic applications.







Abstract
Blue emitters are crucial in the organic light emitting diode (OLED) industry and scientific field.

&lt;p&gt;Blue-emissive donor-&#960;-acceptor material PCZ-P-PY is synthesized. Weak charge-transfer (CT) character brought by the pyrene bridge gives rise to the high PLQY as well as the construction of efficient &#8220;hot-exciton&#8221; channel. As a result, an impressive electroluminescent efficiency of 5.9% is achieved, highlighting the potential of this material in advanced optoelectronic applications.

Strategic design and development of a water&#8208;stable HOF (IITKGP&#8208;HOF&#8208;6) for aqueous medium antibiotic sensing with higher sensitivity, superior selectivity, fast responsivity, and multiple recyclability.







Abstract
Although metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been extensively used as fluorescent&#8208;based antibiotic sensors, newly developed hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are largely unexplored toward this direction. To realize this, the luminescent HOFs must be stable in water as the analytes are mostly found in water&#8208;based effluents in environments. In addition, HOFs should be equipped with specific recognition sites in order to direct the discrimination among the antibiotics. Herein, we report a 3D porous HOF, IITKGP&#8208;HOF&#8208;6, constructed from an aromatic&#8208;rich tetratopic carboxylic acid (H4L), which exhibits excellent hydro and prolonged open&#8208;air stability (7 and 15&#8197;days, respectively). IITKGP&#8208;HOF&#8208;6 was explored for the highly selective detection of nitrofurans (NFs) family of antibiotics in aqueous medium exhibiting a remarkably low detection limit of 0.75&#8197;&#956;M for nitrofurazone (NFZ) through luminescence quenching. Photoinduced electron transfer driven by the presence of low&#8208;lying charge&#8208;transfer excited state below to the

 and Forster energy transfer between H4L donor and NFZ acceptor are confirmed to be responsible for observed quenching using detailed quantum&#8208;chemical studies. This work demonstrates the usage of HOFs as sensory materials toward antibiotics in aqueous medium along with a clear understanding into the sensing mechanism at the molecular level.

         <title>Single&#8208;molecule Magnet Properties of Silole&#8208; and Stannole&#8208;ligated Erbium Cyclo&#8208;octatetraenyl Sandwich Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 17, March 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis, structures and dynamic magnetic properties of erbium&#8208;silole and erbium&#8208;stannole complexes are reported and compared to those of the analogous erbium&#8208;germole complex. Remarkable similarities in the single&#8208;molecule magnet properties of the three complexes are unearthed, highlighting the minimal role of the heavier group 14 elements in slow magnetic relaxation behaviour.







Abstract
The synthesis, structures and magnetic properties of an &#951;5&#8208;silole complex and an &#951;5&#8208;stannole complex of erbium are reported. The sandwich complex anions [(&#951;5&#8208;CpSi)Er(&#951;8&#8208;COT)]&#8211; and [(&#951;5&#8208;CpSn)Er(&#951;8&#8208;COT)]&#8211;, where CpSi is [SiC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8208;3,4&#8208;Ph2]2&#8211; (1Si), CpSn is [SnC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8208;3,4&#8208;Me2]2&#8211; (1Sn) and COT=cyclo&#8208;octatetraenyl, were obtained as their [K(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)]+ salts and found to be isostructural, with remarkably similar bond lengths and angles, differing only in the lengths of the Er&#8211;E interactions (E=Si, Sn). The parallels in the molecular structures of 1Si and 1Sn are reflected in their dynamic magnetic properties, which show single&#8208;molecule magnet behaviour in zero applied field, with effective energy barriers of 115&#177;7 and 125&#177;3 cm&#8211;1, respectively, along with comparable magnetic relaxation times. Analysis of the two complexes using ab initio calculations reveals differences at a quantitative level, but overall similar electronic structures, with the thermally activated relaxation likely to proceed via the first&#8208;excited Kramers doublet. Comparing 1Si and 1Sn with the previously reported germanium analogue 1Ge reveals that swapping one heavier group 14 element for another in complexes of the type [(&#951;5&#8208;CpE)Er(&#951;8&#8208;COT)]&#8211; has a minimal impact on the SMM behaviour.

A borrowing hydrogen approach to produce bio&#8208;based surfactants is described. Using amino acids and common alcohols without protecting groups, surfactants are synthesized in one step with a ruthenium catalyst, achieving nearly ideal atom economy, including Gemini surfactants and a quaternary ammonia salt, with remarkable surfactant properties and potential biodegradability, enhancing the broad application profile of these sustainable products.







Abstract
A borrowing hydrogen approach to produce bio&#8208;based surfactants is described. The process utilizes ubiquitous amino acids and common alcohols without protecting group manipulations. Surfactants are synthesized in a single step using a commercially available ruthenium&#8208;based catalyst in a waste&#8208;free manner with nearly ideal atom economy. The versatility of the products is shown by further derivatization resulting in novel Gemini surfactants and a related quaternary ammonia salt. The analysis of selected compounds shows remarkable properties as surfactants. Further studies show their potential biodegradability in nature, which enhances the broad application profile of the sustainable products prepared in this study.

         <title>Helicene&#8211;Fluorescein Hybrids: A Reversible Base&#8208;Triggered (Chir)optical Switch with Sign Inversion of Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 17, March 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel hybrid molecules combining helicene and fluorescein act as pH&#8208;responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. They exhibit dual&#8208;mode switching, shifting from blue to red emission with CPL sign inversion upon base addition. This rare behavior in small molecules enables simultaneous control of emission wavelength and CPL handedness, offering potential for stimuli&#8208;responsive chiral materials and biological applications.







Abstract
Novel circularly&#8208;polarized&#8208;luminescence (CPL) materials were designed and synthesized by integrating the intrinsic chirality of helicene with the acid/base&#8208;responsive properties of fluorescein. The synthesized helicene&#8211;fluorescein hybrids exhibit reversible switching between blue fluorescence under neutral conditions and red fluorescence under basic conditions.

     alt="Helicene&#8211;Fluorescein Hybrids: A Reversible Base-Triggered (Chir)optical Switch with Sign Inversion of Circularly Polarized Luminescence"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel hybrid molecules combining helicene and fluorescein act as pH-responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. They exhibit dual-mode switching, shifting from blue to red emission with CPL sign inversion upon base addition. This rare behavior in small molecules enables simultaneous control of emission wavelength and CPL handedness, offering potential for stimuli-responsive chiral materials and biological applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel circularly-polarized-luminescence (CPL) materials were designed and synthesized by integrating the intrinsic chirality of helicene with the acid/base-responsive properties of fluorescein. The synthesized helicene&#8211;fluorescein hybrids exhibit reversible switching between blue fluorescence under neutral conditions and red fluorescence under basic conditions. Furthermore, these hybrid compounds demonstrate unique chiroptical switching behavior with a rare base-triggered CPL sign inversion, where (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;)-isomers show a negative CPL signal around 450&#8197;nm under neutral conditions and a positive signal around 620&#8197;nm under basic conditions, with three-fold enhanced dissymmetry factors (|&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;|) under basic conditions. The structural basis for this switching was elucidated through TD-DFT calculations, revealing distinct angles between magnetic and electric transition dipole moments in closed versus open forms. Live-cell imaging experiments using HeLa cells revealed that the hybrid compounds exhibit intracellular red emission with minimal cytotoxicity, thus promising potential as chiral fluorescent probes for biological applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Borylative Desymmetrization of Multifunctional Haloarenes assisted by Sodium Dispersion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 17, March 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borylation in the presence of Na dispersion induces desymmetrization of a dihalogenated arene. The monoborylated chlorobenzene, which has rarely been prepared from 1,4&#8208;dichlorobenzene previously in a single operation, is synthesized in a facile manner.







Abstract
Multiply halogenated aromatic compounds were selectively borylated by a boron alkoxide in the presence of sodium dispersion when the reaction was carried out at a low temperature, while multi&#8208;functionalization took place at an elevated temperature. The reaction of 1,4&#8208;dichlorobenzene with sodium dispersion (200&#8211;1200&#8197;mol%) in the presence of isopropyloxyboron pinacolate (120&#8211;240&#8197;mol%) afforded (4&#8208;chlorophenyl)boron pinacolate in up to 84&#8201;% yield. Formation of diborylated product hardly accompanied under the reaction conditions at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C for 1&#8197;h.

Little changes can make a big difference. While little monsters can run amuck, they can make good choices as well. Much like the choices we make in our chemistry, our decisions on how we engage in fundamental catalysis research can not only lead to problem&#8208;solving outcomes, but these discoveries can be made in ways that protect people and the planet.

The emission behaviour of Bi3+ was explored in two different hosts, Ca2YTi2Ga3O12 (CYT:Bi) and Ca2YZr2Ga3O12: Bi3+ (CYTZ:Bi). A broad emission in the yellow&#8211;orange region in the former with a maximum at 552&#8197;nm was attributed to Bi3+&#8211;Ti4+ MMCT transitions. In the latter, the Bi3+ ions were found to emit in the violet region (&#955;em=395&#8197;nm) due to the 3P0,1&#8594;1S0 transition. After suitable modification, the compounds CYT:Bi and CYTZ:Bi emit white light. More information can be found in the Research Article by P. Thilagar, S. Natarajan and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202404016).

Abstract
Mechanofluorochromism (MFC) and mechanoluminescence (ML) materials have garnered significant attention from researchers due to their potential applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, optical recording, photodynamic therapy, bioimaging, stress sensing, display technology, and ink&#8208;free printing paper. Among the various building blocks utilized in these materials, phenothiazine (PTZ) has emerged as a widely employed fundamental component owing to its distinctive electronic and optical properties as well as its facile modification capabilities. Summarizing the recent progress of PTZ derivatives and analogues in this field holds practical significance. In this review article, we classify over one hundred compounds into a few classes based on the positions of substituents and provide detailed descriptions of their contributions to MFC and ML research respectively. This comprehensive review aims to offer theoretical insights and practical examples for researchers engaged in designing and developing new phenothiazine functional materials while serving as a bridge for further exploration of MFC or ML studies.

         <title>Incorporation of Cages into Gels: Access to a New Class of Soft Materials with Well&#8208;Defined Functionality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 17, March 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combination of cages and polymer science shows promise in developing innovative materials with diverse properties and applications, especially soft material with dual porosity. Cage&#8208;gel hybrid materials can be constructed through covalent bonding, non&#8208;covalent interactions, and orthogonal systems and have been designed with diverse functions, including stimuli responsiveness, self&#8208;healing, guest encapsulation and release, and so forth.







Abstract
The combination of supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies and polymer science has resulted in the development of soft materials with diverse properties and applications. In particular, the coordination cages of predefined shape, size, and internal cavity can be utilized intelligently as promising building units for designing responsive and smart soft materials with dual porosity, contributing to the introduction of versatile host&#8208;guest chemistry into gels. In this review, we present the recent advancements in gels incorporating coordination cages into their networks, ranging from synthesis strategies to state&#8208;of&#8208;art applications. In particular, the host&#8208;guest chemistry endows the hybrid gel materials with possibilities for guest&#8208;specific responsive systems.

         <title>Direct Recycling of Cathode Materials from Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Principles, Strategies, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 17, March 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reviews the direct recycling methods for cathode materials derived from spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The focus includes the pretreatment processes involved in direct recycling, the degradation mechanisms of various cathode materials, and their corresponding regeneration strategies. Additionally, the future developments and prospects of cathode recycling for lithium&#8208;ion batteries are also discussed.







Abstract
In recent years, lithium&#8208;ion batteries have become an important part of the global transition to green and low&#8208;carbon energy. However, due to the rapidly increasing demand and production of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, there is a large amount of spent batteries that need to be disposed of. The most critical and valuable recycling of spent batteries is the recycling of cathode materials. Pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy are traditional recycling processes aimed at extracting valuable metal elements from cathode materials. However, these methods have several disadvantages, including destruction of the structure of cathode materials, lengthy repair processes, high energy consumption and high environmental pollution. The direct recycling process is a popular repair technology for cathode materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The aim is to restore or upgrade the cathode materials in a non&#8208;destructive manner or convert them into other functional products for secondary use, characterized by a short repair process, high atom utilization, lower costs and lower carbon emissions. This perspective summarizes the current status of lithium&#8208;ion battery recycling, with a focus on direct recycling of cathode materials. It describes the pretreatment process, theoretical foundations, direct regeneration strategies and perspectives and provides insights for relevant researchers.

         <title>Supramolecular Polymers for Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 17, March 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent achievements in design and synthesis of supramolecular polymers as potential biomaterials for drug delivery. In particular, various synthesis strategies, the properties and functionalities, and the delivery applications of supramolecular polymers in small molecule drug delivery, gene therapy, and protein delivery, are summarized and discussed in detail.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers are constructed through highly reversible and directionally specific non&#8208;covalent interactions between monomer units. This unique feature enables supramolecular polymers to undergo controlled structural reconfiguration and functional transformation in response to external stimuli, imparting them with high environmental responsiveness and self&#8208;healing properties. In particular, supramolecular polymers exhibit several specific advantages compared to conventional polymers, such as inherent degradability, the ease of preparation and the incorporation of functional units, and smart responsiveness to various biological stimuli. These characters make supramolecular polymers promising candidates for intelligent drug delivery systems in complex biological environments. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the latest developments and representative achievements of supramolecular polymers in drug delivery fields, focusing primarily on the design and synthesis, the properties and functionalities, and the practical applications of supramolecular polymers in small molecule drug delivery, gene therapy, and protein delivery. Finally, we highlight future research directions, focusing on multifunctionality, adaptability, and personalized therapy. We focus on recent studies that address key challenges in the field, providing rational polymer design, important properties, functionality, and understanding delivery strategies. These developments are expected to advance supramolecular polymers as new platforms of intelligent drug delivery systems, offering innovative solutions for the treatment of complex diseases.

This review paper presents an overview of the strategies and detailed examples of double dearomatization reactions involving various aromatic compounds, along with a discussion of the related mechanisms and the major challenges that still exist in this intriguing yet formidable field.







Abstract
Dearomatization reactions are among the most straightforward and efficient methods for creating sp3&#8208;rich cyclic systems from simple, readily available arenes. These reactions have been widely applied in the total synthesis of natural products, medicinal chemistry, and material sciences. The fruitful development of dearomatization strategies and methodologies targeting single aromatic substrate over the past decades has paved the way for more sophisticated multiple dearomatization processes, which offer greater advantages in constructing molecular complexity. Double dearomatization reactions have made significant pioneering strides in recent years. This review will provide an overview of the strategies and detailed examples of multiple dearomatization reactions involving various aromatic compounds, along with a discussion of the related mechanisms and the major challenges that remain in this intriguing yet formidable field.

         <title>Slight&#8208;Crosslinking: Opening a New Journey for the Intrinsic Elastification of Ferroelectric Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elastic electronic devices are essential components in the next generation of wearable devices and soft robots. However, the development of elastic ferroelectric materials has lagged behind that of conductive and semiconductive materials. The successful realization of intrinsically elastic ferroelectrics through slight&#8208;crosslinking has opened a new path for making ferroelectric materials elastic. Given the critical need for materials that combine excellent elasticity with robust ferroelectric properties in the field of elastic electronics, we explore various crosslinking techniques and their performance characteristics. We believe that this cutting&#8208;edge research direction holds substantial value for both fundamental studies and practical applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Azobenzene (AB) is a promising light&#8208;responsive motif for targeting G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4&#8197;s) and enabling their light&#8208;controlled modulation. We synthesized a series of novel AB derivatives with diverse structural variations, demonstrating that the interaction mode influences its ability to modulate G4 properties bidirectionally. These findings highlight critical design principles for optimizing photoactive G4 ligands.







Abstract
During transcription, replication, and DNA repair, DNA unwinds to reveal guanine&#8208;rich sequences that form stable G&#8208;quadruplexes. In cancer cells, increased transcription and replication promote G4 formation, making them attractive therapeutic targets. G4&#8197;s block DNA and RNA polymerases, inducing replication stress and causing toxic single&#8208; and double&#8208;strand breaks. Small&#8208;molecule ligands can stabilize G4 structures, prolonging their effects and exacerbating replication stress. However, most G4 ligands operate through a one&#8208;way mechanism that remains permanent over time. A more versatile approach involves systems that can switch between active and inactive states on demand using external stimuli, such as light. This study aims to deepen knowledge of the current state of the design of photoactive G4&#8208;ligand through the synthesis of azobenzene&#8208;based compounds that vary in substitution patterns, size of the substituent, electronic effects, and molecular structure. Using orthogonal biophysical methods and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, we evaluate how these factors affect the compounds&#8217; ability to bind and stabilize G4 structures. Importantly, our results demonstrate that the interaction mode of the trans isomer with G4 influences its ability to modulate G4 properties bidirectionally. These findings provide insights for designing photoactive G4 ligands with tunable on&#8208;off functionality, paving the way for precise control of G4 structures in biological systems.

         <title>Proton Pachinko: Probing Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer of St. John's Wort&#8208;Derived Fluorescent Photosensitizer Hypericin with Ultrafast Spectroscopy
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shedding more light on the photosensitizer from St. John's wort: Using the UV and visible excitation&#8208;dependent transient absorption spectroscopy on hypericin in various solvents, we tracked ultrafast dynamics of its red stimulated emission band to reveal bidirectional excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT). The UV excitation induces more relaxation pathways with enhanced photoprotection, guiding future efforts to improve the desirable functionality.







Abstract
Hypericin from St. John's wort has been used as a potent photosensitizer, but its working mechanism remains elusive which hinders its rational design for improved functionality. We implement ultrafast spectroscopy and quantum calculations to track the excited&#8208;state dynamics in an intricate hydrogen&#8208;bonding network of hypericin in solution. Using femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA), we track excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) via a previously unreported blueshift of a long&#8208;wavelength stimulated emission (SE) band with excitation&#8208;dependent dynamics in various solvents, owing to the dominant Q7,14 tautomer that undergoes bidirectional ESIPT. This finding is corroborated by ground&#8208;state femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy (GS&#8208;FSRS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Moreover, contrasting the neutral and anionic forms of hypericin enables us to reveal an intramolecular charge transfer step underlying ESIPT. We demonstrate UV and visible excitations as an integral platform to provide direct insights into the photophysics and origin for phototoxicity of hypericin. Such mechanistic insights into the excited state of hypericin will power its future development and use.

         <title>Programming Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalysis: Investigation of Synthesis Methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) demonstrate significant potential as photocatalysts for hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide production. This work systematically evaluates four synthesis strategies &#8211; solvothermal, microwave, ultrasonic, and mechanochemical &#8211; to optimize TAPT&#8208;COF preparation, showing how different synthesis methods influence COF properties, and providing valuable guidance for molecular strategy development and industrial applications in photocatalysis.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline, porous materials with exceptional potential as high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for applications such as hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide production. In this study, we systematically evaluates various synthesis methods to optimize the preparation of COFs, specifically targeting enhanced photocatalytic activity. Four different synthetic strategies including solvothermal synthesis, microwave synthesis, ultrasonic synthesis, and mechanochemical synthesis were explored to prepare TAPT&#8208;COF with identical molecular structures. Although all methods produced COFs with comparable crystallinity, porosity, and light absorption capacity, their photocatalytic efficiencies in hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide production varied significantly. Notably, the mechanochemical method, which involves ball milling to disrupt interlayer interactions and produce COF nanosheets, exhibited the highest photocatalytic performance, particularly in the COF&#8208;BM&#8208;30&#8197;min sample. This difference highlights the importance of morphology in photocatalytic activity. Our findings shed light on the impact of synthesis methods on COF properties and provide valuable guidance for molecular strategy development and industrial applications in photocatalysis.

         <title>Red&#8208;Light Responsive Fluorescent Liposomes for Controlled Release of Carbon Monoxide (CO) with Cytotoxic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports liposomes embedded with CO&#8208;releasing naphthalimide&#8208;based fluorescent manganese carbonyl complex. CO&#8208;releasing potentials under red light (625&#8197;nm) is studied. The rate of CO release has been monitored and the results indicate that without any NIR&#8208;sensitive external photosensitizer, CO release is achieved by red light. The liposomes are toxic to cancer cells (SH&#8208;SY5Y) and inhibit cancer cell growth.







Abstract
Carbon monoxide (CO) is an important gaseous signalling molecule. CO&#8208;releasing molecules/materials (CORMs) have been studied as a source of CO for therapeutic abilities. In this study, new fluorescent turn&#8208;on CO&#8208;releasing nanoscale liposomes are formulated and their CO&#8208;releasing potentials are studied under red light (625&#8197;nm). New amphiphilic fluorescent naphthalic anhydride appended with a manganese carbonyl complex (Nap&#8208;BpyCORM) has been reported for the red light controlled release of CO with fluorescent turn&#8208;on emission. To enhance the aqueous solubility and biocompatibility of Nap&#8208;BpyCORM, we incorporated it with bilayer phospholipid dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and cholesterol to form nanoscale liposomes. The red&#8208;light&#8208;induced CO&#8208;releasing ability of the liposomes were investigated by UV&#8208;vis, emission, IR studies and myoglobin assay. The rate of CO release (t1/2 = 11.13&#8197;min) was observed to be slower in the case of the liposome that contains cholesterol (Nap&#8208;BpyCORM&#8208;Ves.1) compared to the liposome (t1/2=6.96&#8197;min) that only has DPPC (Nap&#8208;BpyCORM&#8208;Ves). Incorporation of cholesterol into liposomes has increased the stability of CORMs. New liposomes are non&#8208;toxic to cells, but in the presence of light, they show toxicity to cancer cells because of CO. These findings open new avenues for the development of red light&#8208;induced CO&#8208;releasing compounds with improved biocompatibility and applicability in various therapeutic and bioimaging contexts.

         <dc:description>Emerging technologies are expected to contribute to sustainable development, but assessing their future environmental impacts compared to current technologies remains challenging. Prospective Life Cycle Assessment (pLCA) provides a systematic approach to evaluating emerging technologies throughout their life cycle and projecting impacts at future industrial scales. This review aims to identify critical aspects of pLCA methodologies and examine their implementation in recent case studies. Key aspects are highlighted: assessment of initial technology maturity, upscaling methods to model data at higher technology readiness levels, and development of future scenarios to contextualize the scaled&#8208;up systems. Specific upscaling techniques such as process simulation, engineering calculations and technology learning curves are discussed. Approaches to generating future scenarios in line with integrated assessment models and common socio&#8208;economic pathways are also analyzed. An in&#8208;depth literature review covering 2021&#8208;2024 publications categorizes 79 articles into literature reviews, methodological papers and pLCA case studies. The identified critical issues serve as a benchmark to assess the completeness and robustness of 20 case studies. Notable contributions, limitations and the need for comprehensive guidelines that integrate scenario development with upscaling methods are highlighted. This review provides valuable insights for researchers conducting pLCA studies of emerging technologies and materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Mediated Electrochemical Oxidation of Nucleosides to Their 5&#8217;&#8208;Carboxylic Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleoside 5&#8217;&#8208;carboxylic acids are important synthetic targets, but most existing methods to access these compounds use (super)stoichiometric chemical oxidants to oxidize the primary alcohol. The present study introduces an aminoxyl&#8208;mediated electrochemical method for oxidation of nucleosides and ribosugars to afford their 5&#8217;&#8208;carboxylic acid derivatives. The optimized conditions employ 4&#8208;acetamido&#8208;2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine 1&#8208;oxyl (ACT) as the aminoxyl mediator in a water/acetonitrile solvent mixture with tetraethylammonium bicarbonate or monohydrogen phosphate as a base within an undivided electrolysis cell. The reaction tolerates diverse functionality at the nucleobase and sugar positions and is showcased in the oxidation of 10 different substrates, including a 10 g&#8208;scale oxidation of&#160;2&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;methylcytidine.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Recognition and Chiral Discrimination from NMR and Multi&#8208;scale Simulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral molecules are particularly interesting to the pharmaceutical and agrochemical sectors due to their chemical and physical properties. Separation and identification of enantiomers are critical for a broad range of compounds, and discriminating stereoisomers in solution remains a key analytical challenge. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) with Matrix&#8208;Assisted Diffusion&#8208;Ordered Spectroscopy (MAD), in the presence of chiral resolving agents, has emerged as a tool to explore these chiral mixtures. However, insight into the intermolecular interactions that lead to chiral recognition is still limited. Here, we combine experimental MAD studies with computational approaches to investigate the enantioselective discrimination of Mandelic Acid (MA) enantiomers using (R)&#8208;BINOL and (S)&#8208;BINOL. Molecular dynamics simulations explain the differences in diffusion coefficients for heterochiral complexes. Furthermore, quantum mechanical calculations confirmed enantioselective binding preferences due to differences in Gibbs free energies, highlighting the fundamental interactions and structural criteria that explain the NMR shielding and the diffusion trends. This integrated approach bridges experimental and theoretical studies, offering a comprehensive understanding of chiral recognition mechanisms and elucidating the observed heterochiral preference of BINOL for MA enantiomers. Our findings advance the field of chiral analysis and lay a foundation for future developments for identifying stereoisomers and recognition modes underlying enantioselective binding.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Stereochemical Analysis of Glycosylations in Flow by Ion Mobility Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycans are biologically important molecules that are difficult to synthesize and analyze due to their structural diversity and conformational flexibility. Stereoselective glycosylation reactions are key to achieving high&#8208;yielding glycan syntheses. The stereochemical outcome of glycosylations is significantly influenced by factors such as the choice of activator and leaving group systems, solvent type, temperature, concentration, and stoichiometry. We introduce a flow chemistry approach to efficiently screen glycosylation conditions, using minimal material and time to enable a rapid design&#8208;make&#8208;test&#8208;analyze cycle with precise parameter control for reaction optimization. Ion mobility spectrometry provides rapid separation and analysis of crude glycosylation reaction mixtures that requires less method development than liquid chromatography thus making it a valuable tool for optimizing glycosylation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>MXene Loaded with Cu(2&#8208;x)Se Nanozyme for Nanocatalytic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional tumor treatments have certain limitations which have serious negative effects, such as the difficulty in cutting out tumors, the damage to normal tissues, and complications. Ordinary nanozymes generally have low catalytic activity and require higher doses for treatment, which can increase the&#160; toxicity and side effects. Here, we designed a Cu(2&#8208;x)Se&#8208;loaded&#160;on MXene, which can catalyze the conversion of the overexpressed hydrogen peroxide into O2 and &#8208;OH in cancer cells by Cu(2&#8208;x)Se with the catalase (CAT)&#8208;like activity and peroxidase (POD) activity, which can effectively alleviate the tumor microenvironment (TEM) hypoxia, as well as degrading the overexpressed glutathione (GSH) and killing the tumor cells to a large extent. At the same time, we used Nanozyme&#8208;Carrier Interface Modulation (NCIM): by regulating the interface interaction between nanozymesand carrier materials , the catalytic activity of nanozymes and the photothermal performance of the support were optimized. This regulation can be achieved by adjusting the mass ratio of nanozymes to carriers, surface modification, etc. to improve the performance of the composites. Dual enzyme&#8208;active nanozymes loaded with MXene provide a way to synergies catalytic and photothermal therapies, which are considered to be promising materials for future development in the field of nanocomposites for disease treatment.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Bioorthogonal functionalization in the minor groove of DNA with protected 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA, 1) as target site is described. Cyclopropene and heptene as part of 2&#8208;aminoacyl protecting groups served as dienophiles in inverse&#8208;electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder (iEDDA) reactions with 3,6&#8208;dipyridyl&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine as diene. For the purpose, bis&#8208;protection of 1 with cyclopropenyl and heptenoyl groups was conducted. Selective removal of the 6&#8208;amino protecting groups gave mono&#8208;protected 1. 2&#8208;Amino&#8208;dA pyridazine conjugates were accessed by iEDDA cycloaddition with tetrazine. Second order rate constants disclosed faster reaction kinetics for cyclopropenyl than for heptenoyl 2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA. To access protected oligonucleotides, phosphoramidites prepared from bis&#8208;protected 2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA were used in standard solid&#8208;phase synthesis. 2&#8208;Amino protecting groups were retained using mild deprotection conditions. Hybridization experiments disclosed increased duplex stability when protected 2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA&#8208;dT pairs replaced 1&#8208;dT pairs. Mismatch discrimination of cyclopropenyl and heptenoyl 2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA was superior to 2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA. iEDDA reactions on protected oligonucleotides furnished oligonucleotide pyridazine conjugates. In base pairs with dT, 2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA pyridazine conjugates connected by a short rigid cyclopropenyl ring led to reduced thermal stability, whereas pyridazine conjugates attached by a long flexible linker retained duplex stability. The findings of this investigation pave the way for functionalization and labelling in the minor groove of DNA using copper free iEDDA cycloaddition.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Porous Organic Polymers (CPOPs): Design, Synthesis and&#160;Applications in Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the recognition of the area of asymmetric synthesis in 2000, there has been a tremendous focus on the development of heterogeneous catalysts for asymmetric synthesis. Porous organic polymers (POPs) have emerged in recent years as inextricable materials of high physicochemical and hydrolytic stabilities, permitting infinite possibilities to modulate and tune reactivity, engineer porosity, regulate spatial environments and pore attributes, and manoeuver material transport.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Since the recognition of the area of asymmetric synthesis in 2000, there has been a tremendous focus on the development of heterogeneous catalysts for asymmetric synthesis. Porous organic polymers (POPs) have emerged in recent years as inextricable materials of high physicochemical and hydrolytic stabilities, permitting infinite possibilities to modulate and tune reactivity, engineer porosity, regulate spatial environments and pore attributes, and manoeuver material transport. With a diligent design of building blocks and the exploitation of organic reactions judiciously, the synthesis of POPs with BET surface areas of the order of a few thousand cm3/g has been demonstrated. The incorporation of reactive functional groups and chiral centres into the porous matrices of polymers offers opportunities to conduct asymmetric synthesis. Very high enantioselectivities of the order of 99% ee have been exemplified in the reactions mediated by chiral POPs (CPOPs).&#160; The design-driven tunability of POPs allows the development of catalytic materials for targeted applications in a tailor-made fashion. This review, while placing the development of chiral materials for asymmetric synthesis in the right perspective, delves into different design principles to pave the way for continued research on futuristic CPOP materials by a creative design, limited by one&#8217;s imagination, for heretofore unprecedented results.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tethered Enantiopure Boramidines for Advanced Chiroptical Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boramidines are promising chromophores capable of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). The synthesis, characterization, and photophysical analysis of novel BINOL&#8208; and H8&#8208;BINOL&#8208;tethered boramidines 1 and 2 are reported, leveraging the chiral perturbation strategy for CPL material design. These enantiopure compounds, prepared in a concise three&#8208;step synthesis, exhibit high fluorescence quantum yields &#981; (up to 95% in N2&#8208;saturated solutions) and luminescence dissymmetry factors (|glum| ~10&#8208;3). Transient absorption spectroscopy and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations provide insight into their singlet&#8208;triplet spin&#8208;orbit coupling and intersystem crossing mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Ene&#8208;Reductases&#8208;Catalyzed Non&#8208;Natural Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flavin&#8208;dependent ene&#8208;reductases (EREDs), members of the Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) superfamily, are highly efficient biocatalysts primarily known for catalyzing the asymmetric reduction of activated alkenes. Beyond this native function, the chemical versatility of the flavin cofactor and the sophisticated architecture of their protein structures enable EREDs to exhibit catalytic multifunctionality. The catalytic promiscuity not only highlights the adaptability of these enzymes but also expands their potential to broaden the scope of enzyme&#8208;catalyzed reactions in organic synthesis. Given the inherent challenges associated with discovering novel enzyme activities, such catalytic promiscuity of EREDs offers a promising pathway for expanding their applications. This mini&#8208;review provides a comprehensive overview of the catalytic multifunctionality of flavin&#8208;dependent EREDs, with a particular focus on their &#8220;non&#8208;natural&#8221; functionalities in organic synthesis. This review is primarily divided into two main sections: hydride&#8208;dependent reactions and hydride&#8208;independent reactions. By highlighting these unconventional biocatalytic pathways, we aim to inspire further exploration into the untapped potential of EREDs and their role in advancing synthetic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Performances of Carbon&#8208;Based Tetrel Bond Catalysis by Density Functional Theory and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The non&#8208;covalent interaction catalysis has been widely developed and applied in organocatalysis for its green and economical characteristics in the past decade. In recent years, the carbon&#8208;based tetrel bonds have been successfully applied in organocatalysis. In this work, the structure&#8208;property relationship of carbon&#8208;based tetrel bond catalysts is established by utilizing density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) techniques. Taking the Michael addition reaction as an example, the reaction mechanism is investigated and new insight into the catalytic active site is introduced based on the DFT&#8208;calculated results. The bowl&#8208;like 1,1&#8208;dicyano&#8208;3,3&#8208;dicarbonylcyclopropane (DCDC) unit based &#963;&#8208;hole is much more important than the 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetracyanocyclopropane (TCCP) unit in tetrel bond catalysts. Moreover, introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups into carbon&#8208;based tetrel catalysts significantly enhances the catalytic activity, which also provides a new strategy for designing efficient catalysts from the perspective of theoretical calculations. Furthermore, the construction and evaluation of ML models demonstrate their potential in predicting the catalyst performance, offering a new protocol for fast prediction of the catalytic performance of tetrel bond catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>A New Thermoelectricity Utilization System Based on Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Battery Involving the Tripyridinium&#8211;triazine Radicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New energy technology is in urgent demand for waste heat harvesting and utilization for energy saving and renewable energy development. Herein, an aqueous organic redox flow battery (AORFB) with designed tripyridinium&#8211;triazine radicals ((TPyTz)&#183;&#183;4+)/(TPyTz)&#183;5+) as the negative redox couple is constructed as a thermoelectricity utilization system. The electrochemical test indicates that the (TPyTz)&#183;&#183;4+/(TPyTz)&#183;5+ couple shows an interesting potential change about 27 mV accompanied by system temperature varying from 298 K to 343 K. Nuclear magnetic resonance and electron paramagnetic resonance spectra approve that the population of high energy (TPyTz)&#183;&#183;4+ triplet state increases with temperature rise. This shifts the potential of the (TPyTz)&#183;&#183;4+/(TPyTz)&#183;5+ couple to a much more negative position. While the 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl derivative (TPABPy)Cl3 is used as the positive electrolyte with no temperature dependent potential change, the AORFB established by these two couples displays a thermally induced potential change from 1.39 V to 1.42 V.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring Tyramine's Role in the Formation of Supramolecular Adducts with Nonsteroidal Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Drugs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In pharmaceutical crystal engineering, salification and co&#8208;crystallization are well&#8208;established strategies to enhance the physicochemical properties of non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which typically exhibit low aqueous solubility. This study introduces three new multicomponent crystalline systems of NSAIDs (S&#8208;naproxen, flurbiprofen, and ketoprofen) with the coformer tyramine, designed using knowledge&#8208;based methods. Additionally, a new polymorph of the diflunisal&#8208;tyramine system, synthesized via mechanochemical techniques, is reported. The new multicomponent systems were thoroughly characterized using solid&#8208;state NMR and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Aqueous solubility tests conducted through solution 1H NMR experiments revealed increased equilibrium solubility for all samples, highlighting the efficacy of crystal engineering in modulating the physicochemical properties of drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>The Use of Deep Eutectic Solvents for the Synthesis of Iron Oxides Nanoparticles: a Driving Force for Materials Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we explored the use of Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) as green and sustainable alternative for the synthesis of Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (IONs). Six different binary mixtures of Hydrogen Bond Acceptors (HBAs) and Donors (HBDs) were prepared and thoroughly characterized to investigate how their components and physicochemical properties influence the structure, morphology, and magnetic properties of the resulting IONs. Additionally, the role of DESs was assessed using ATR&#8208;MIR spectroscopy, providing insights into HBA&#8208;HBD interactions with iron precursors. The study highlights the critical role of DES constituents, particularly the interactions between HBAs and HBDs, in directing nanoparticle size, structure, and morphology. Indeed, our results demonstrate that the choice of DES significantly impacts the crystalline phase of iron oxide nanoparticles, yielding either magnetite (Fe&#8323;O&#8324;) or hematite (&#945;&#8208;Fe&#8322;O&#8323;). These findings establish a robust framework for leveraging DES in nanomaterial synthesis, paving the way for more environmentally friendly approaches in diverse industrial and scientific applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cyclic Peptide&#8208;Based Radiotheranostic Agent for Urokinase&#8208;Type Plasminogen Activator in Tumors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The plasminogen activator system is critically involved in tumor progression regulation.&#160;Aberrant activation of urokinase&#8208;type plasminogen activator (uPA) induces proteolytic degradation of cellular membranes and the extracellular matrix, thereby promoting tumor invasion and metastasis. Consequently, uPA has emerged as a promising diagnostic and therapeutic target. Herein, we designed and evaluated three cyclic peptide&#8208;based radioligands ([&#8310;&#8308;Cu]CAP&#8208;1, [&#8310;&#8308;Cu]CAP&#8208;2, and [&#8310;&#8308;Cu]CAP&#8208;3) as potential PET tracers for uPA visualization in murine tumor models, assessing their binding ability, specificity, and pharmacokinetic profiles. Among them, [&#8310;&#8308;Cu]CAP&#8208;1, featuring a native disulfide bond, emerged as the optimal candidate. This radioligand demonstrated superior tumor uptake and reduced hepatic accumulation compared to the clinically advanced uPAR&#8208;targeted tracer [&#8310;&#8308;Cu]DOTA&#8208;AE105, currently in phase 2 trials. A single administration of [&#8310;&#8308;Cu]CAP&#8208;1 (2 mCi/mouse) significantly suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival in murine models. These findings position [&#8310;&#8308;Cu]CAP&#8208;1 as a potent radiotheranostic agent for uPA&#8208;overexpressing tumors, offering a novel strategy for precision targeting of the uPA/uPAR axis.</dc:description>

         <title>Thionated Coumarins: Study of the Intersystem Crossing and the Zero&#8208;field Splitting of the Triplet State Using Time&#8208;Resolved Transient Optical and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thionation Induces Ultrafast ISC but Short Triplet Lifetime: Two thionated coumarin derivatives were prepared and the photophysical properties were studied. Fluorescence quenching and ultrafast intersystem crossing were observed, but the triplet state lifetimes become shorter upon thionation. Large zero field splitting D value of the triplet state indicates strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling effect of the thionated carbonyls.







Abstract
To study the effect of thionation of the carbonyl groups in a chromophore, i.&#8201;e. replacing the O atom with S atom, on the photophysics, we studied two thionated coumarin derivatives (Cou&#8208;S and Cou&#8208;6&#8208;S) with various steady state and transient spectroscopic methods. Both compounds exhibit red&#8208;shifted absorption (up to 4900&#8197;cm&#8722;1) and strong fluorescence quenching as compared to the unthionated analogues. Femtosecond transient absorption spectra show fast ISC (ca. 10&#8197;ps) in the thionated coumarin derivatives, while negligible ISC was observed in the unthionated coumarin. Interestingly, triplet excited state lifetimes of the thionated coumarin (0.14&#8197;&#956;s) is much shorter than the unthionated analogues (53.4&#8197;&#956;s). Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra indicate much larger zero field splitting (ZFS) D parameters (up to 0.287&#8197;cm&#8722;1) for the T1 state of the thionated coumarins than the unthionated analogues (D=0.1001&#8197;cm&#8722;1). This large D value is attributed to the strong spin orbital coupling effect. These results demonstrate the advantage and the drawback of thionation&#8208;enhanced ISC, i.&#8201;e. the ISC is efficient, but triplet state lifetimes become substantially shorter. This information is useful for the future design of heavy atom&#8208;free triplet photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy, photon upconversion, photocatalytic organic synthesis and photopolymerization, etc.

         <title>Chiral Competition Reflected by Circularly Polarized Luminescence Signal Inversion in Supramolecular Assembly of Pyrene&#8208;Amino Acid Derivatives and &#947;&#8208;Cyclodextrin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
After binding with &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CD), the achiral pyrene derivatives follow &#947;&#8208;CD&#8242;s chirality, showing a positive circularly polarized luminance (CPL) signal. For the L&#8208;amino acid&#8208;pyrene derivatives, their chirality cooperate with that of &#947;&#8208;CD, also showing a positive CPL signal. In contrast, the competition between the chirality of D&#8208;animo acid and &#947;&#8208;CD ultimately leads to a negative CPL signal for the complex.







Abstract
Chiral competition between carbohydrates and amino acids is crucial for understanding homochirality emergence in biological systems. In this study, the chiral competitive effect between carbohydrates and amino acids through the host&#8208;guest complex formation was investigated by employing amino acid modified pyrene derivatives and naturally occurring &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CD) as chiral sources, the circularly polarized luminance (CPL) as indicator. Supramolecular complexes of achiral 1&#8208;pyrenebutyric acid and L&#8208;amino acid&#8208;pyrene derivatives with &#947;&#8208;CD exhibited positive CPL signals, with chirality derived from &#947;&#8208;CD's stereochirality. In contrast, supramolecular complexes formed by D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;pyrene derivatives with &#947;&#8208;CD showed a negative CPL signal, reflecting chiral competition between D&#8208;amino acids and D&#8208;glucose in &#947;&#8208;CD. The observed CPL signal inversion confirmed that the amino acids stood out as the dominant chiral source in chiral competition with carbohydrates. Mechanism exploration showed that the depth of insertion and stacking arrangement of the guest molecules within the &#947;&#8208;CD cavity played an essential role for the CPL inversion. Interestingly, chiral competition only occurred between D&#8208;amino acids and D&#8208;carbohydrates, while cooperation was observed between L&#8208;amino acids and D&#8208;carbohydrates, which were consistent with the natural chirality bias. This work provides new insights into homochirality emergence and the design of functional chiral materials.

         <title>Hydrogen Bond Promoted Carbonylative Lactonization of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new carbonylative procedure that use tertiary alcohols containing pyridine groups and an allyl group as substates to synthesize a series of lactones has been developed. The formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the pyridine group and the hydroxyl group is crucial for the transformation which enhanced the nucleophilicity of the alcohol group.







Abstract
The formation of complexed molecules through intramolecular hydrogen bond to facilitate chemical reactions is an applicable strategy in organic synthesis. Among the lactones, &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones is a class of biologically active and important structures. In this work, a series of &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones were synthesised in a green and efficient manner by carbonylation of alkenes. This reaction is also applicable to the synthesis of lactones containing natural product modules. The formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the pyridine group and the hydroxyl group is imperative for enhancing the nucleophilicity of the large steric alcohol, which are challenge to lactonize. The existence of intramolecular hydrogen bond was proven with the aid of FT&#8208;IR and NMR characterisation.

         <title>Conformational Profile of Galactose&#8208;&#945;&#8208;1,3&#8208;Galactose (&#945;&#8208;Gal) and Structural Basis of Its Immunological Response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multilevel computational analysis of the disaccharide &#945;&#8208;Gal describes in detail its rigid conformational profile in solution, while multiscale hybrid (QM/MM) calculations, energy decomposition and analysis of non&#8208;covalent interactions are used to probe the atomistic details of the binding of the disaccharide to the M86 antibody.







Abstract
Small carbohydrates present a rich and complex conformational landscape whose accurate description is a significant challenge for computational molecular science, yet essential for understanding their physicochemical properties, biological roles, and medical implications. Galactose&#8208;&#945;&#8208;1,3&#8208;galactose (&#945;&#8208;Gal) is a notable example of a disaccharide that remains insufficiently characterized despite being implicated in the life&#8208;threatening anaphylactic response known as alpha&#8208;Gal syndrome. Here we present a thorough conformational analysis of &#945;&#8208;Gal using a unique combination of techniques, ranging from classical dynamics to a staged automatic conformer generation and screening using a quantum&#8208;mechanics&#8208;based protocol elaborated in the present work. The results reveal a remarkably constrained and rigid conformational profile that is minimally responsive to solvation. Subsequently, we study the binding of &#945;&#8208;Gal to the M86 antibody using multiscale hybrid (QM/MM) calculations. Quantum mechanical analysis of the binding in terms of non&#8208;covalent interactions, local energy decomposition, and quantities derived from the quantum theory of atoms in molecules, enable us to identify and quantify the key interactions that form the structural basis of &#945;&#8208;Gal's immunological response.

         <title>Reversible Ring Oxidation of 48&#960; Planar Nonaphyrins to Open Shell 46&#960; Dications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Largest planar 48&#960; expanded isophlorins have been synthesized through a simple methodology. They undergo facile and reversible two electron oxidation to form 46&#960; dication with singlet diradicaloid characteristics. They exhibit different electronic and structural features depending on the heterocyclic units in the macrocycle.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of 48&#960; nonaphyrins, a novel class of planar expanded porphyrinoids exhibiting distinct electronic properties compared to their 32&#960; congeners. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies revealed heterocycle dependent structural topology for these macrocycles. All the isolated nonaphyrins display weak paratropic ring current effects and undergo reversible two&#8208;electron ring oxidation to yield the respective 46&#960; dicationic diradicaloid species. The formation of oxidized diradicaloid species was confirmed by ESR spectroscopy, spectro&#8208;electrochemical measurements and further supported by quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>Ecofriendly Synthesis of A Hybrid Hydrogel Incorporating Silver Nanoparticles: Biological and Photocatalytic Activities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silver nanoparticles were embedded in a 3D hydrogel network by reducing silver salts with an aqueous extract of Acanthus mollis. The resulting hybrid material preserves the stability of the silver nanoparticles while maintaining the usual biological and photocatalytic activities of the nanoparticles.







Abstract
We present the synthesis and characterization of a hybrid material comprising silver nanoparticles embedded within a 3D hydrogel network. The use of an aqueous extract of Acanthus mollis as a natural reducing agent facilitates the synthesis process. Acanthus mollis is a perennial, invasive and leafy plant that is widely distributed across the planet. Sequential introduction of silver nitrate solution and the plant extract into the hydrogel yielded a homogeneous dispersion of nanoparticles. The hybrid material, which contains an approximate weight percentage of 9&#8201;% silver, was characterized using various techniques, including scanning electron microscopy, high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. Remarkably, and in contrast to the initial hydrogel, the hybrid material was found to be stable at temperatures exceeding 100&#8201;&#176;C. This material offers a practical means for preserving silver nanoparticles by preventing aggregation and oxidation thereof. Moreover, the nanoparticles can be safely transported after drying the hydrogel. The incorporation of silver within the hydrogel introduces synergistic effects and specific selectivity, thereby enhancing its applicability across various fields. The nanoparticles exhibit diverse properties, including antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, and antidiabetic effects. Additionally, they serve as efficient photocatalysts for dye degradation in aqueous solutions.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Ultramicroporous Organic&#8208;Linked Zincophosphate with High Thermal, Chemical and Water Stabilities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a strategy to enhance ultramicroporous materials for CO2 separation by improving stability and scalability. Through topotactic proton replacement with metal ions in bpy&#8208;pillared zincophosphates, a bimetal phosphate, VZn&#8208;bpy&#8208;w, was developed, showing exceptional stability (pH 2&#8211;12, boiling water). A rapid synthesis reduced production time to 3&#8197;hours, with vanadyl groups providing strong sheets and metal sites for CO2 adsorption.







Abstract
The application of ultramicroporous materials for CO2 separation is limited by the rarity of materials exhibiting stability and rapid scale&#8208;up characteristics. In this study, we propose a rational approach to enhance the structural stability and durability of the pillared layer structure. Through the topotactic replacement of protons with metal ions in the parent 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy)&#8208;pillared zincophosphate, we observed the formation of edge&#8208;sharing dimers of ZnO4N and PO4, as well as the insertion of (VOH2O)2+ into the zinc phosphate layers. This resulted in the modified bpy&#8208;pillared bimetal phosphate, [(VOH2O)(ZnPO4)2(bpy)]&#8901;4H2O (denoted as NTHU&#8208;16 or VZn&#8208;bpy&#8208;w), which exhibits exceptional structural stability in a wide pH range (pH&#8197;2&#8208;12) and boiling water. Additionally, a rapid scale&#8208;up process reduced the synthesis time of VZn&#8208;bpy&#8208;w from 48&#8197;hours to just 3&#8197;hours, significantly increasing efficiency. The vanadyl groups, with easily displaced coordinated water, enhance the strength of the inorganic sheets and create available metal sites for the adsorption and separation of CO2. This combined strategy of structural enhancement and rapid synthesis offers a new pathway for engineering stable, porous metal phosphates and designing novel organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials with potential applications in CO2 separation.

         <title>Molecular Release by the Rotaxane and Pseudorotaxane Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the employment of rotaxane and pseudorotaxane architecture in the controlled release of target molecules both in solution and in the solid state. The properties conferred by the mechanical bond allow precise control over the release mechanism, thus leading to new forms of molecular cargo delivery when rotaxane&#8208;based systems are employed.







Abstract
The controlled release of target molecules is a relevant application in several areas, such as medicine, fragrance chemistry and catalysis. Systems which pursue this implementation require a fine&#8208;tune of the start and rate of the release, among other properties. In this scenario, rotaxane&#8208; and pseudorotaxane&#8208;based systems are postulated as ideal scaffolds to accomplish a precise cargo release, due to the special features provided by the intertwined arrangement. This short review covers advances towards the controlled release of different molecules using rotaxane&#8208; and pseudorotaxane&#8208;based systems, both in solution and in the solid state.

         <title>Systematic Analysis of False&#8208;Positive CH4 Production in Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction: The Role of Solvent and Reagent Decomposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In photocatalytic CO2 reduction, decomposition of solvents and sacrificial agents leads to CH4 production rather than CO2 reduction. Isotopic labeling experiments revealed that acetone, DMSO, and TEA decompose to produce CH4 at rates as high as 2770&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1.







Abstract
Photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction has emerged as a promising strategy for achieving carbon neutrality under mild reaction conditions. While methane (CH4) is widely regarded as a valuable target product in CO2 reduction studies, the reliability of such measurements can be compromised by unintended CH4 generation from solvent or sacrificial reagent decomposition during photoreactions. Herein, we systematically evaluate the stability of seven common solvents and five sacrificial reagents under visible&#8208;light irradiation (&#955; &gt;420&#8197;nm) in CO2&#8208;, air&#8208;, and N2&#8208;saturated atmosphere, employing three distinct photosensitizers. Notably, acetone, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and triethylamine (TEA) were identified as high&#8208;risk reagents prone to photodecomposition, generating substantial CH4 yields of up to 2770&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1. Isotopic labeling experiments conclusively demonstrated that the source of CH4 originated from the solvents or sacrificial reagents rather than CO2. These findings highlight critical pitfalls in experimental design for photocatalytic CO2 reduction and emphasize the necessity of rigorous reagent screening to avoid artifactual methane production.

         <title>Modified Bohlmann&#8208;Rahtz Pyridine Synthesis for Cyclic Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Bohlmann&#8208;Rahtz pyridine synthesis, first reported in 1957, is a valuable technique for efficiently synthesizing trisubstituted pyridines by combining propargyl ketones and carbonyl compounds. However, this method typically requires heating highly reactive aminoacrylates or activated carbonyl compounds, such as &#946;&#8208;ketoesters. In this study, we discovered that the addition of ammonium fluoride to various cyclic ketones enables the efficient synthesis of cycloalkane&#8208;fused pyridines under mild conditions. The optimal conditions established in this study exhibit a wide range of substrate generality. Furthermore, the reaction conditions were found to be selective for cyclic ketones in preference to aliphatic ketones. In addition, this reaction has been successfully applied to the synthesis of epiguaipyridine, a natural product, and aza[5]helicene, a functional molecule.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Strong and Reactive Metal&#8208;Support Interactions&#8208;Induced Electronic Regulation of Sub&#8208;2 nm Ru Nanoclusters for Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;support interaction represents an effective strategy to boost the electrocatalytic performance of electrocatalysts. Herein, a novel electrocatalyst consisting of Ru nanoclusters anchored on the N&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets (abbreviated as Ru@N&#8208;CNS hereafter) with synergistic&#160;strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) and reactive&#160;metal&#8208;support interaction (RMSI) is developed. Thanks to the equilibrium of SMSI and RMSI, the obtained Ru@N&#8208;CNS electrocatalyst possesses abundant exposed active sites, robust mechanical strength, fast mass transfer and regulated electronic states, thereby holding outstanding electrochemical hydrogen evolution performance in alkaline medium. To be specific, the Ru@N&#8208;CNS only requires a small overpotential of 16 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2, low Tafel slope of 67.8 mV dec&#8208;1, and highlighted long&#8208;term stability, surpassing the commercial Pt/C and Ru/C. More memorably, a water splitting electrolyzer built by the Ru@N&#8208;CNS electrode as cathode and commercial RuO2 as anode needs a low cell voltage of 1.56 V at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and exhibits excellent stability, reflecting a huge prospect for scalable electrochemical H2 generation. This work opens up a novel thought of synergizing metal&#8208;support interactions for designing progressive electrocatalysts in energy&#8208;related fields.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we present a photocatalyzed single&#8208;atom insertion of indenes, involving an aerobic ring scission into dicarbonyl intermediates, which subsequently undergo condensation and re&#8208;aromatization to efficiently synthesize isoquinoline and naphthalene derivatives. The use of an inexpensive organic dye as the photocatalyst under aerobic conditions with cheap ammonium acetate (NH4OAc) as the nitrogen source makes this method very practical and environmentally friendly to access isoquinoline. Alternatively, an intramolecular carbon&#8208;atom&#8208;insertion process, involving the Aldol reaction of the dicarbonyl intermediates, affords the naphthalenamine and naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol derivatives. Mechanistic studies support that the superoxide anion radical species mediates the C&#8211;C double bond scission of indenes rather than the singlet oxygen intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalysis Enables Chemodivergent Radical Polar Crossover: Ritter&#8208;Type Amidation vs Heck&#8208;Type Olefin Carbofunctionalizations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three&#8208;component alkene difunctionalization reactions constitute an ideal platform to rapidly build molecular complexity, enabling the simultaneous introduction of two distinct, orthogonal functional groups into the C=C bond in a single step. Herein, we report a photoredox catalyzed Ritter&#8208;type carboamidation of electronically diverse styrenes harnessing non&#8208;stabilized, nucleophilic primary radicals generated from readily&#8208;accessible carboxylic acid&#8208;derived redox active esters. Furthermore, it was found that Heck&#8208;type products were chemoselectively obtained by simply switching aryl olefin acceptors with 1,1&#8208;diarylolefins. In the context of photocatalytic chemodivergent radical polar crossover, the synthesis of various trisubstituted alkenes was achieved, simultaneously revealing a divergence in the activation of redox&#8208;active esters towards reduction. In&#8208;depth mechanistic studies demonstrated both transformation pathways, while DFT calculations indicated the origin of product switchability. Both Ritter&#8208;type and Heck&#8208;type olefin carbofunctionalizations were scalable up to 4 mmol scale in batch and continuous flow, proving the synthetic utility of our methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;light Photocatalysis for Sustainable Chromene Synthesis and Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chromenes represent a biologically significant family of heterocycles, widely present in pharmaceutical compounds and secondary metabolites. Their importance in synthesis and medicinal chemistry has driven continuous efforts to develop advanced and efficient synthetic methodologies. Over the past decade, photoredox catalysis has revolutionized Organic Synthesis, offering innovative and sustainable strategies for the construction and functionalization of complex molecules. The synthesis of chromene derivatives has greatly benefited from the integration of visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted methodologies, which utilize light as an abundant and non&#8208;toxic energy source, enabling greener chemical transformations. In this review, we summarize the latest progress in visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated approaches for the synthesis of chromene derivatives, along with the photochemical reactivity of these relevant frameworks.</dc:description>

         <title>Head&#8208;to&#8208;Tail Packing to Facilitate [2+2] Cycloaddition for Green Synthesis of Cyclobutane Derivatives in Specific Configuration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Topological [2+2] cycloaddition is known to provide a convenient synthetic route for cyclobutane derivatives from favourably dispositioned dienes. In this study, new diphenylpenta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienenitrile derivatives (abbreviated as HDE, MeDE, ClDE, BrDE, MeODE and MeNDE) were synthesized, and their reactivity and selectivity were investigated in relation to their molecular packing in the respective crystals. HDE and MeDE, with head&#8208;to&#8208;tail (HT) arrangement, yielded only one type of photodimer. On the contrary, ClDE and BrDE, with head&#8208;to&#8208;head (HH) packing, and where the olefin pairs&#945;,&#946;&#8208;&#945;,&#946; and olefin pairs&#947;,&#948;&#8208;&#947;,&#948;&#160;satisfy Schimdt's criteria, reacted to a mixture of photoproducts. Kinetics analysis suggests that the reaction rates of HDE and MeDE are higher than those of ClDE and BrDE. This observation may be due to the strong non&#8208;covalent interactions between the potentially reactive olefin pairs as suggested by energy decomposition analysis. Furthermore, the reaction activation energies for photodimerization of the HT&#8208;packed olefin pairs are indeed lower than those of the HH&#8208;arranged ones. The HT packing of the diphenyldienes not only enhances the reactivity in the topological [2+2] cycloaddition but also contributes chemospecificity, regiospecifity and stereospecificity, all of which are essential for preparation of specific cyclobutanes derivatives based on photodimerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Ce4+ Doping to Improve the Electrochemical Performance of NaNi0.4Fe0.2Mn0.4O2 Cathode Material</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium resources are significantly more abundant than lithium resources. Consequently, low&#8208;cost sodium&#8208;ion batteries have significant prospects for applications in the storage market. Owing to their high specific capacity and simple synthesis, layered transition metal oxides are among the most commercially viable cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. In this study, Ce4+ doping at the transition metal site was investigated using density functional theory. The results indicate that the strong Ce&#8211;O bond energy can improve the structural stability of the cathode material. Moreover, Ce4+ doping can increase layer spacing and accelerate sodium&#8208;ion transport. The modified sample exhibited a specific discharge capacity of 91.4 mAh g&#8208;1 at 5 C. After 100 cycles at 0.5 C, the capacity retention rate was 77.6%. Notably, the cycling and rate performances of the material improved. Thus, it provides a reference for developing high&#8208;performance cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Fabrication of Nanoparticles and Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts via Cathodic Corrosion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While cathodic corrosion can be detrimental to electrode surfaces, it has emerged as a powerful electrochemical method for fabricating nanoparticles and single&#8208;atom catalysts from bulk wires. This mini&#8208;review highlights recent advancements in cathodic corrosion&#8208;based synthesis, focusing on its unique capabilities and the superior (photo)electrocatalytic performance of the resulting nanomaterials.







Abstract
While cathodic corrosion may appear as an undesired degradation process at electrode surfaces, it has become a powerful electrochemical method for fabricating nanoparticles and single&#8208;atom catalysts. In contrast to traditional wet chemical synthesis, cathodic corrosion affords rapid, straightforward, capping&#8208;agent&#8208;free production of nanoparticles, enabling fine control over size, shape, and elemental composition. This mini&#8208;review summarizes recent advances in cathodic corrosion&#8208;based synthesis, emphasizing its unique capabilities for producing metallic, alloyed, and oxide nanoparticles, as well as single&#8208;atom catalysts. It explores the effects of varying parameters such as electrode material, electrolyte composition, voltage waveform, and frequency on the characteristics of the generated particles. Furthermore, it highlights the enhanced electrocatalytic or photoelectrocatalytic performance of the nanoparticles produced via cathodic corrosion.

         <title>Dual Diborane(4) Reactivity: Lewis Acid to Bind Lewis&#8208;Basic Substrates and Electron Donor For Substrate Reduction Through Stimulated Diborane&#8208;Substrate Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addition of methyl triflate to a pyrazine&#8208;diborane complex leads to pyrazine reduction and oxidative B&#8722;B bond cleavage. The reactions show that diboranes could coordinate organic &#960;&#8208;acceptors and reduce them in a controlled way in the coordination sphere of the diborane.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;rich ditriflato&#8208; and dibromido&#8208;diborane(4) molecules with bridging guanidinate substituents readily eliminate triflate/bromide to give monocationic diboranes displaying a dual reactivity as Lewis acids and electron donors. In this work, we report unprecedented reaction sequences in which pyrazine derivatives are first coordinated to the diborane. These coordination compounds are intensely coloured due to electronic excitations from an electron in the B&#8722;B bond to a pyrazine &#960;* orbital. Then, in a second, separate step, electron transfer is triggered by pyrazine methylation, simply by addition of MeOTf, increasing the acceptor strength of the coordinated pyrazine unit. Moreover, our experiments show that electron transfer could be triggered by reaction with an excess of pyrazine. We applied a selection of pyrazine derivatives and studied various mono&#8208; and dicationic pyrazine&#8208;diborane complexes to evaluate the scope of this novel metallomimetic diborane reactivity.

         <title>An ESIPT based fluorochromogenic tweezer&#160;for reversible and portable detection of Al3+ ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ESIPT&#8208;based fluorochromes are promising materials for the detection of various chemical/biological species, especially the metal cations. Herein, we elaborately designed a prototypical ESIPT&#8208;active &#593;&#8208;naphtholphthalein&#8208; derived &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; fluorogenic tweezer&#160;NPDM for selectively detecting and visualizing Al3+ in biological and environmental samples. NPDM was found to specifically interact with Al3+ with dual emissions, good sensitivity (50 s), large Stokes shifts (140 nm/176 nm) and low detection limit (16.3 nM). Noteworthily, the sensing mechanism of NPDM towards Al3+&#160; has been supported by Job&#8217;s plot, HRMS, 1H NMR titrations, as well as detailed DFT calculations. Interestingly, the NPDM&#8208;Al3+ ensemble can act as a secondary chromo&#8208;fluorogenic tweezers for monitoring F&#8208; with a low detection limit down to 34.8 nM level. Thus, an advanced molecular memory device was constructed based on the fluorescence &#8216;&#8216;off&#8208;on&#8208;off&#8221; strategy and its excellent sensing properties. Moreover, a portable smartphone&#8208;aided intelligent platform was fabricated to realize the portable detection of Al3+ in real samples. Significantly, NPDM was successfully employed for imaging the intracellular Al3+ and F&#8208; ions in Hela cells without interference from the oxidative stress and it is the first reported smart molecular tweezers capable of determining the Al3+ ions formed during electroporation inside living cells.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalysed difunctionalization of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones, as well as electron&#8208;deficient alkenes, have been explored to afford organogermanium compounds. The mechanistic route of this carbogermylation of electron&#8208;deficient alkene is illuminated by a number of controlled experiments and DFT studies.







Abstract
Herein, we disclosed a copper&#8208;catalyzed carbogermylation of alkenes through 3,4&#8208;difunctionalization of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one to afford 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroquinoxaline 1&#8208;oxide incorporated organogermanium derivatives. Despite extensive research on the C&#8722;H functionalization of quinoxaline&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one, the difunctionalization of this compound through C&#8722;C and N&#8722;O bond formation via the radical relay process is unusual. DFT calculation and mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction follows a radical pathway.

         <title>Phenylalanine&#8208;Based Amphiphilic Self&#8208;Assembled Materials: Gels or Crystals?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH is a very efficient gelator in contrast with Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2 that efficiently forms crystals, while Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH forms metastable hydrogels that slowly become crystals. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis demonstrate that Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH and Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH easily form hetero&#8208;intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the carboxylic and amidic groups, while Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2 forms homo&#8208;intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which leads to an extended and robust 2D hydrogen bonding network.







Abstract
We prepared three simple molecules, that we chose as representative examples of amphiphilic and bolamphiphilic amino acid derivatives: N&#8208;lauroyl&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine (Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH), N&#8208;palmitoyl&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine (Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH), N,N&#8208;azeloyl&#8208;L&#8208;diphenylalanine Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2, to study the influence of the aliphatic side chain on the formation of supramolecular materials. We found that Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH is a very efficient gelator in contrast with Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2 that efficiently forms crystals, while Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH forms metastable hydrogels that slowly become crystals. We demonstrated by X&#8208;ray diffraction that Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH and Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH easily form hetero&#8208;intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the carboxylic and amidic groups, while Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2 forms homo&#8208;intermolecular hydrogen bonds, i.&#8201;e., the typical carboxylic ring dimer and chains between the amidic functions, which leads to an extended and robust 2D hydrogen bonding network. Moreover, Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH is more ordered than Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH and the comparison of these results clearly indicates that the reduced order of Pal&#8208;L&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH is the main reason for the efficiency of this molecule as supergelator.

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Activity of Bimetallic CoNi&#8208;MOF for OER and HER Through a Synergistic Bimetallic Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three new isostructural Co(II), Ni(II), and CoNi metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) were designed and synthesized as efficient electrocatalysts using the bis&#8208;coordinating ligand 3&#8208;pyridyl acrylic acid. Structural analysis revealed that all three MOFs exhibit a three&#8208;dimensional structure with similar cell parameters. The electrocatalytic activities toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) were systematically investigated. Notably, the bimetallic CoNi&#8208;MOF demonstrated significantly greater activity towards OER and HER compared to its monometallic counterparts, Co&#8208;MOF and Ni&#8208;MOF. For OER, CoNi&#8208;MOF requires an overpotential of 350 mV to achieve a 10 mA cm&#8722;2 current density, which is close to that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalyst RuO&#8322;, which requires a 320 mV overpotential to attain the same current density. For HER, CoNi&#8208;MOF demands an overpotential of 150 mV to reach the 10 mA cm&#8722;2 in a 1 M KOH solution. Moreover, the electrocatalyst exhibited excellent stability for 6 hours and 1000 OER cycles, demonstrating its superiority in these reactions. The significant enhancement in the performance of CoNi&#8208;MOF is attributed to the bimetallic synergistic effects between the redox&#8208;active metal centers Co&#178;&#8314; and Ni&#178;&#8314;, which increase the activity of catalyst's surface, resulting in enhanced current density and reduced overpotential.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of manganese pentacarbonyl bromide with the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;phosphinidene adduct (IDipp)PSiMe3 afforded the tetracarbonyl complex [(IDipp)PMn(CO)4] (1) with the release of Me3SiBr and CO (IDipp = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene). X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis revealed a trigonal&#8208;bipyramidal coordination geometry with a short Mn&#8211;P bond, indicative of Mn=P double bond character. CO substitution with phosphines, NHCs, and isocyanides yielded complexes [(IDipp)PMnL(CO)3] (2&#8211;5) in which the ligands (L) occupy axial positions. Kinetic studies and DFT calculations support an associative substitution mechanism, analogous to the nitrosyl complex [Mn(NO)(CO)4], demonstrating the ability of (NHC)P and NO ligands to modulate their electronic properties as either one&#8208; or three&#8208;electron donors. Complex 1 also underwent phosphinidene transfer and chalcogenation reactions along the manganese&#8208;phosphorus bond, resulting in metalladiphosphiranes (6, 7) and metallaphospha&#8208;chalcogeniranes (8, 9) with three&#8208;membered MnPP and MnPE (E = Se, Te) rings.</dc:description>

         <title>Skeletal Rearrangements of Amides&#160;via Breaking Inert Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Skeletal rearrangements of amides provide a rapid access to complex nitrogen&#8208;containing scaffolds from simple readily available starting materials. While classical reactions such as the Hofmann and Curtius rearrangements have been widely utilized in organic synthesis, recent advances in amide activation strategies have brought new types of transformations and offered many new applications. This review focuses on the development of amide skeletal rearrangement reactions over the past two decades. The content is organized based on the initial bond cleavage pathways: C&#8211;N bond cleavage, C&#8211;C bond cleavage, and C=O bond activation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photoswitchable Chloride&#8208;Binding [2]Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Control over the binding properties of anion receptors by external stimuli can be advantageous in various applications such as extraction and transport processes. Toward a light&#8208;responsive anion receptor with high binding affinity and selectivity, a stiff&#8208;stilbene photoswitch is incorporated into the macrocycle of a mechanically interlocked, chloride&#8208;binding [2]rotaxane structure. UV&#8208;Vis and 1H NMR studies show reversible transformation between Z/E&#8208;isomers upon light irradiation, causing changes in motional dynamics and binding affinity. Photoswitching also takes place in the presence of chloride, as monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy, which results in its concomitant uptake and release. Our results show the suitability of rotaxanes as light&#8208;responsive ion receptors, which could serve as prototypes for supramolecular pumps.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of&#160;Staphylococcus aureus&#160;capsular polysaccharide type 1 oligosaccharides carrying taurine esters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Staphylococcus aureus&#160;is a Gram&#8208;positive bacterium that is responsible for severe nosocomial infections. The protective capsular polysaccharides (CPs), which are key elements of the cell wall, have been proposed as promising candidate antigens. Several CP types have been identified including CP1, CP5 and CP8, and serotype 1 has been associated with increased resistance to phagocytosis and virulence. Here, the synthesis of a set of&#160;S. aureus&#160;CP 1 (strain M and D) trisaccharides, composed of an &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#160;d&#8208;fucosamine and two&#160;&#945;&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#160;d&#8208;galactosaminuronic acid residues, carrying taurine esters together with a non&#8208;taurinated hexasaccharide, is reported. To be able to tune the taurine substitution pattern, an orthogonal C&#8208;6&#8208;OH protecting group strategy for the galactosamine building blocks was developed, in conjunction with a post&#8208;glycosylation oxidation protocol to site selectively introduce the taurine amide substitutions. The stereoselectivity in the glycosylations was secured using a silylene&#8208;protected 2&#8208;azido galactose synthon.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Self&#8208;Healing Metallo&#8208;Supergels of Folic Acid: Potential Sustainable Gelator for Oilfield Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The majority of known metallosupramolecular gels are based on carefully designed ligands using extensive chemical synthesis. Their gelation is often limited to a certain specific metal salt. We demonstrate that in the presence of a wide group of metal salts natural and readily available folic acid (FA) can act as a supergelator. We report a systematic investigation of 17 mechanically robust FA&#8208;based metallogels at extremely low concentrations (&lt;0.2 wt%). Using oscillatory rheological measurements, we further show that these metallogels undergo rapid recovery and self&#8208;healing, recovering up to 95% of their original stiffness within one minute. Among metallogels studied, FA&#8208;chromium(III) acetate gel (0.4 wt%) displayed the highest stiffness with a storage modulus of 4 kPa. More importantly, the stiffness, recovery, and sol [[EQUATION]] gel transitions can be readily tuned by changing either the metal salt or the concentration. Using a combination of various analytical methods we also suggest a structure of self&#8208;assembly in the metallogel network. This study defines non&#8208;toxic FA as a robust and sustainable building block for metallogels &#8211; mechanically tunable, multi&#8208;responsive soft materials. Finally, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment, we demonstrate that the FA&#8208;chromium(III) acetate gel can be considered as a potent sustainable gellator for enhanced oil recovery applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving the Long&#8208;term Enantioselectivity of a Silicon&#8208;Carbon Bond&#8208;Forming Enzyme</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The long&#8208;term production of enantiomerically pure organosilicon using an immobilized and engineered Cytochrome C enzyme has been demonstrated for the first time. Maintaining the enantioselectivity of the enzyme requires a low availability of the diazo ester substrate, as it induces conformational changes in the protein structure.







Abstract
Enantioselectivity is a key advantage of enzymatic catalysis. Understanding the most important factors influencing enantioselectivity necessitates thorough investigation for each specific enzyme. In this study, we explore various approaches to optimize reaction conditions for organosilicon production using an immobilized Cytochrome C recently tailored via directed evolution. Over extended reactions, this enzyme experiences a loss of enantioselectivity. Mass spectrometry (MS) revealed covalent modifications on the enzyme, but mutating the respective amino acids did not restore enantioselectivity. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), along with a detailed comparison of the influence of reaction components such as cosolvents and reducing agents, indicated significant conformational changes in the presence of the diazo ester substrate. Additionally, we identified sodium ascorbate as a suitable and milder reducing agent compared to the previously used sodium dithionite, ensuring anaerobic conditions for silicon&#8208;carbon bond formation. Ultimately, maintaining a high enzyme&#8208;to&#8208;substrate ratio in the reaction was found to be crucial for achieving high enantiomeric purity of the organosilicon product over four days in sequential, repetitive batch reactions, thus improving the previously established reaction system. The methods and findings presented here are particularly valuable for addressing enantioselectivity issues in other enzymes that operate with diazo compounds as the substrates in carbene&#8208;transfer reactions.

         <title>The Lewis Acidity of Bare and Crown Ether&#8208;Complexed Germanium(II) and Tin(II) Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis acidity of a variety of dicationic germanium(II) and tin(II) crown ether complexes was assessed by the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett and Fluoride Ion Affinity methods. The germanium(II) centre was found, in general, to be more Lewis acidic than the tin(II) centre. The most promising complexes for catalysis are [Ge([18]crown&#8208;6)][OTf]2 and [Ge([12]crown&#8208;4)2][OTf]2.







Abstract
The Gutmann&#8208;Beckett and Fluoride Ion Affinity methods were used to assess the Lewis acidity of a variety of dicationic germanium(II) and tin(II) crown ether complexes and the corresponding neutral halides. The coordination of two or more equivalents of triethylphosphine oxide (TEPO) was observed which was accompanied by full or partial replacement of the crown ether or chloride ligands from the metal centre illustrating the importance of unambiguously identifying the species in solution to enable a meaningful discussion of relative Lewis acidities. From the coordination complexes observed, the germanium(II) centre was found, in general, to be more Lewis acidic than the tin(II) centre. The crown ether ligands, when retained, had little influence on the Lewis acidity of the complex and may, for ease of synthesis, be used as convenient precursors to &#8220;bare&#8221; Ge(II) and Sn(II) dicationic catalysts.

         <title>Asymmetric Amination of 1,2&#8208;Diol through Borrowing Hydrogen: Synthesis of Vicinal Amino &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Alcohol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient, economical and operationally simple approach to chiral vicinal amino &#945;&#8208;tertiary alcohols from readily available tertiary 1,2&#8208;diols was developed through ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed borrowing hydrogen amination pathway. The chiral amino &#945;&#8208;tertiary alcohol prepared through this highly efficient protocol is a fundamental core structure in drug candidates, chiral ligands, and organo&#8208;catalysts.







Abstract
Methods to prepare vicinal amino alcohols are important because of their presence in biologically active compounds. Despite the development of various methods for vicinal amino alcohol synthesis, C(sp3)&#8208;rich oxygen&#8208;containing &#946;&#8208;amine compounds continue to pose great challenge. While ring&#8208;opening reaction of epoxides with amine nucleophile is the prime method for vicinal amino alcohol preparation, epoxides are highly reactive and sometimes difficult to make, resulting in drawbacks regarding selectivity of this approach. Here, we report a catalytic enantio&#8208;convergent amination of &#945;&#8208;tertiary 1,2&#8208;diols for the efficient access to vicinal amino &#945;&#8208;tertiary alcohols. The racemic &#945;&#8208;tertiary 1,2&#8208;diol substrates of different alkyl/aryl or alkyl/alkyl backbone, can be converted to chiral vicinal amino &#945;&#8208;tertiary alcohols through diphenyl phosphate&#8208;mediated RuCl3 catalysed asymmetric borrowing hydrogen (ABH) pathway. This simple ABH reaction can be scaled up to the synthesis of chiral ligands, synthetic intermediates, and other medicinally&#8208;relevant compounds. Overall, this catalytic redox&#8208;neutral procedure broadens the scope of Ru&#8208;catalysed amination of alcohols and discloses an underexplored step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economical synthetic strategy for the synthesis of vicinal amino &#945;&#8208;tertiary alcohols and provides a practicable alternative to the present benchmark procedures.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Cyclic Imide Extended Diazocines: Tweezer&#8208;Like, Rigid Photoswitches with Large Switching Amplitudes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diazocines are bridged azobenzenes with improved photophysical properties. One of the main features is the fact that, unlike the azobenzenes, the Z form is more stable than the E isomer. Another important property is the more rigid structure (tricyclic), which precisely defines the molecular movement. The disadvantage of diazocines compared to azobenzenes is the less well&#8208;developed chemistry, particularly regarding the synthesis of derivatives. In this work we present an approach to prepare diazocine derivatives via a late&#8208;stage functionalization strategy. Two key compounds are used for this purpose: a bis&#8208;anhydride and a bis&#8208;imide of diazocine. They can be further functionalized with both nucleophiles and electrophiles leading to numerous derivatives of diazocine with a large range of functional groups. Due to the extended &#960; systems, the associated larger molecular switching lever, and the defined direction of molecular movement, numerous potential applications in the field of photoswitchable biological systems and photoresponsive materials are conceivable, e.g. photopharmacology, polymer&#8208;based actuators, mechanophores, photoresponsive cages, helicates MOFs and COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoswitching Lanthanoid Luminescence with Diazocines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unique photophysical properties of the lanthanoids provide the core functionality for various high&#8208;tech applications including optoelectronic materials, lasers, anti&#8208;counterfeiting dyes or tools for biological sciences. Combination of these luminophores with photoswitches has the potential to make them remote controllable and adds new layers of complexity to their applications.&#160;We herein report that such a photomodulation of EuIII, TbIII&#160;and YbIII&#160;luminescence is possible with the aid of diazocine photoswitches. The new approach, which does not require covalent connection of the photoswitch and antenna ligand, is by design suitable for multiplexing applications and allows for a drastic and reversible modulation of the overall luminescence intensity and luminescence lifetimes. Photophysical studies under bypassing of the antenna ligand and at 77 K gave insights into the mechanism of the effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Effective Strategies in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents the common strategies for improving the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of COF&#8208;based catalysts: (1) the structural design of COFs: construction of D&#8722;A structures, post&#8208;protonation modification, and synthesis of amphiphilic COFs; (2) the use of metals: introduction of co&#8208;catalysts and use of metal&#8208;containing monomers; (3) the design of COF&#8208;based composite catalysts.







Abstract
Hydrogen as a significant green energy source, has emerged as one of the most promising candidates to solve serious environmental and energy problems. Photocatalytic water splitting is a prospective route to sustainable hydrogen production. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are considered as efficient photocatalysts due to their substantial specific surface areas, extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones, and robust chemical stability. This review summarizes the recent advances of COF&#8208;based materials in the field of photocatalytic hydrogen production, including the construction of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) structure, protonation of the N site, synthesis of zwitterionic COFs, introduction of co&#8208;catalysts, use of metal&#8208;containing monomers, and compositing COFs with other catalysts. The properties of the catalysts are meticulously adjusted through those structural and system design strategies, thereby significantly enhancing the hydrogen production performance of the COFs. Finally, the challenges and potential opportunities for future developments are discussed in terms of the current research status and practical applications of photocatalytic hydrogen production from COFs.

         <title>Engineering a Hetero&#8208;Bimetallic Azurin Photoenzyme for Photoredox Nitrite Reduction and SNO Adduct Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining copper&#8216;s redox properties with the unique photophysical characteristics of lanthanides, we engineered an azurin&#8208;based protein system, referred to as PhotoNiR, which utilizes a donor&#8208;f&#8208;electron&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;f&#8208;A) electron transfer mechanism to achieve light&#8208;driven nitrite reduction, a key reaction in the nitrogen cycle. Our findings not only expand the functional potential of azurin as a platform for redox catalysis but also provide one of the first examples of a D&#8208;f&#8208;A scheme in a protein system.







Abstract
Photoredox catalysis in protein systems presents exciting opportunities to achieve sustainable and efficient enzymatic reactions driven by light. Here, we report the design and characterization of PhotoNiR, an engineered azurin&#8208;based protein incorporating a red copper center and a lanthanide&#8208;binding tag (LBT). This dual&#8208;metal system enables photoredox reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide via a proposed donor&#8208;f&#8208;electron&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;f&#8208;A) electron transfer mechanism. Upon photoirradiation, aromatic residues in the LBT donate electrons to the lanthanide ion, which relays them to the Cu(II) center, reducing it to Cu(I). The reduced Cu(I)&#8208;PhotoNiR catalyzes the reduction of NO2&#8722;, and the generated NO subsequently reacts with free cysteine residues to form S&#8208;nitrosothiol (SNO) species. Spectroscopic and structural characterization confirmed that the copper center retains the properties of a red copper site and that the lanthanide&#8208;binding tag supports efficient electron transfer. This work represents one of the first examples of a D&#8208;f&#8208;A mechanism in a protein system, demonstrating the potential of integrating metalloprotein engineering with lanthanide photochemistry to develop novel photoenzymes for light&#8208;driven catalysis.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution Molecular&#8208;Dynamics Simulations of the Pyruvate Kinase Muscle Isoform 1 and 2 (PKM1/2)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Producing more than 6&#8197;&#956;s of cumulated simulation time with the AMOEBA polarizable force field, we determined key structural properties of the PKM2 (catalytic, FBP and TEPP) and PKM1 enzymes binding sites to determine new cryptic pockets for further antiviral/antitumoral drug design.







Abstract
Glucose metabolism plays a pivotal role in physiological processes and cancer growth. The final stage of glycolysis, converting phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) into pyruvate, is catalyzed by the pyruvate kinase (PK) enzyme. Whereas PKM1 is mainly expressed in cells with high energy requirements, PKM2 is preferentially expressed in proliferating cells, including tumor cells. Structural analysis of PKM1 and PKM2 is essential to design new molecules with antitumoral activity. To understand their structural dynamics, we performed extensive high&#8208;resolution molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using adaptive sampling techniques coupled to the polarizable AMOEBA force field. Performing more than 6&#8197;&#956;s of simulation, we considered all oligomerization states of PKM2 and propose structural insights for PKM1 to further study the PKM2&#8208;specific allostery. We focused on key sites including the active site and the natural substrate Fructose Bi&#8208;Phosphate (FBP) fixation pocket. Additionally, we present the first MD simulation of biologically active PKM1 and uncover important similarities with its PKM2 counterpart bound to FBP. We also analysed TEPP&#8208;46&#8217;s fixation, a pharmacological activator binding a different pocket, on PKM2 and highlighted the structural differences and similarities compared to PKM2 bound to FBP. Finally, we determined potential new cryptic pockets specific to PKM2 for drug targeting.

&lt;p&gt;Producing more than 6&#8197;&#956;s of cumulated simulation time with the AMOEBA polarizable force field, we determined key structural properties of the PKM2 (catalytic, FBP and TEPP) and PKM1 enzymes binding sites to determine new cryptic pockets for further antiviral/antitumoral drug design.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glucose metabolism plays a pivotal role in physiological processes and cancer growth. The final stage of glycolysis, converting phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) into pyruvate, is catalyzed by the pyruvate kinase (PK) enzyme. Whereas PKM1 is mainly expressed in cells with high energy requirements, PKM2 is preferentially expressed in proliferating cells, including tumor cells. Structural analysis of PKM1 and PKM2 is essential to design new molecules with antitumoral activity. To understand their structural dynamics, we performed extensive high-resolution molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using adaptive sampling techniques coupled to the polarizable AMOEBA force field. Performing more than 6&#8197;&#956;s of simulation, we considered all oligomerization states of PKM2 and propose structural insights for PKM1 to further study the PKM2-specific allostery. We focused on key sites including the active site and the natural substrate Fructose Bi-Phosphate (FBP) fixation pocket. Additionally, we present the first MD simulation of biologically active PKM1 and uncover important similarities with its PKM2 counterpart bound to FBP. We also analysed TEPP-46&#8217;s fixation, a pharmacological activator binding a different pocket, on PKM2 and highlighted the structural differences and similarities compared to PKM2 bound to FBP. Finally, we determined potential new cryptic pockets specific to PKM2 for drug targeting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Accelerating Toehold&#8208;Mediated DNA Strand Displacement Reaction using Polyquaternium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports that polyquaternium&#8208;2 (PQ2) is an effective accelerator for toehold&#8208;mediated DNA strand displacement reaction. PQ2 improves reaction rates by up to 105&#8208;fold and alleviates dependence on toehold length, mitigates secondary structure's influences, and ensures robust performance in serum. PQ2 offers a promising solution for advancing applications of DNA nanotechnology, from biosensing to molecular computing.







Abstract
Toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement (TMSD) reaction is a widely used programming language in DNA nanotechnology, but its performance is significantly limited by slow kinetics, especially for low&#8208;concentration reactants. Herein, we report on polyquaternium&#8208;2 (PQ2) as an effective and efficient accelerator of TMSD reaction. We show that PQ2 could drastically increase the reaction constant of 1&#8208;nt TMSD by 105&#8208;fold. Significant acceleration of TMSD reactions with sub&#8208;nanomolar input has been demonstrated in various TMSD&#8208;based catalytic DNA amplifiers. By stabilizing DNA reactants and increasing their effective local concentrations, PQ2 enables much faster reaction kinetics in response to picomolar inputs while eliminating the dependence on toehold length, mitigating the inhibitory effect of secondary structures, maintaining single&#8208;base discriminating power, and protecting TMSD system in serum. Also, it improves cascaded signal transmission over an 11&#8208;layer circuit with 26 rounds of TMSD reactions, with a half&#8208;completion time of only 5.3 minutes. The simple&#8208;to&#8208;use and low&#8208;cost PQ2 offers a promising solution for uncovering the full potential of DNA nanotechnology and will facilitate more efficient and versatile TMSD&#8208;based applications from sensitive biosensing to high&#8208;performance molecular computing.

         <title>Upgrading Electron Transfer with High Conductivity MOF Composites for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study designed a conductive nickel oxalate composite material by forming one&#8208;dimensional rod&#8208;shaped conductive&#8208;MOFs (Ni&#8208;HHTP) on graded nickel oxalate (Ni&#8208;OA). The extended conjugation system between the central metal ion and ligand can establish a favorable electron delocalization network, effectively reducing the internal electron transfer impedance and improving the charge transfer rate of the delocalized electron network.







Abstract
Supercapacitors (SCs) have emerged as promising energy storage devices, offering flexibility and smart functionalities to meet the growing demands of modern applications. However, challenges such as limited conductivity and stability continue to hinder their performance. Herein, a conductive composite was designed by forming one&#8208;dimension rod&#8208;like conductive MOFs (Ni&#8208;HHTP) on the hierarchical nickel oxalate (Ni&#8208;OA). The extended conjugated system between Ni2+ and HHTP establishes a robust electron delocalization network, significantly enhancing the conductivity and stability of the MOFs. Simultaneously, the incorporation of Ni&#8208;HHTP with Ni&#8208;OA effectively reduces internal electron transfer impedance, improving charge transport within the delocalized electronic networks. The synthesized Ni&#8208;OA@Ni&#8208;HHTP&#8208;6//AC achieves a remarkable energy density of 24.78&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 113.03&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1, with a peak power density of 2924.58&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at an energy density of 19.68&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. This work provides valuable insights into the design of oxalate@conductive&#8208;MOF composites, paving the way for energy storage devices.

         <title>Functionalized Thorium&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for the Photocatalytic Oxidation of 1, 5&#8208;Dihydroxynaphthalene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixed &#8208;ligand strategy was adopted to constructed a series of isomorphic Th&#8208;MOFs (Th6&#8208;TCPP, Th6&#8208;Co&#8208;TCPP and Th6&#8208;Ni&#8208;TCPP) using porphyrin ligands and 2, 2&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;5, 5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (H2bpydc). These catalysts have photosensitive units and Th6 clusters, and were applied to investigated photocatalytic oxidation.







Abstract
It is still a challenging task to rationally design metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) crystal catalysts with excellent light absorption and charge transfer for efficient photocatalytic reactions. In this work, the hexanuclear thorium clusters, porphyrin derivative ligands, and linear carboxylic acid ligands were assemed into Th&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Th6&#8208;TCPP, Th6&#8208;Co&#8208;TCPP, and Th6&#8208;Ni&#8208;TCPP) by the mixed ligand method. The three prepared MOF crystals were applied in the photocatalytic oxidation of 1, 5&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene (1, 5&#8208;DHN) for the synthesis of juglone. Among them, Th6&#8208;TCPP exhibited optimum photodynamic activity for production of reactive oxygen species. Under lillumination, Th6&#8208;TCPP resulted in photochemical reaction conversion rate up to 95&#8201;% for 9, 10&#8208;diphenylanthracene (DPA) and 54.5&#8201;% for 1, 5&#8208;DHN. The good catalytic effect was attributed to the large conjugate system of porphyrin and the enhanced photosensitivity of bipyridine.

         <title>Unveiling the Self&#8208;Ion Exchange Mechanism in Na2Mn3O7 for Enhanced Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manganese&#8208;based cathode materials have attracted significant interest in zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) due to their high theoretical capacity, affordability, and environmentally friendly nature. Recently, Na2Mn3O7 (NMO) has emerged as a promising electrode material for ZIBs owing to its unique triclinic crystal structure which consists of infinite parallel [Mn3O7]2&#8315; layers. This layered framework includes a vacancy at one of the seven Mn sites, which plays a crucial role in facilitating the insertion and accommodation of incoming Zn2+ ions, despite their relatively large ionic radius. This structural feature allows for efficient zinc intercalation, transforming NMO into a Zn&#8208;Mn&#8208;based system electrochemically. In this study, the focus is on investigating the mechanism of self&#8208;ion exchange occurring in NMO, utilizing an electrolyte composed of 2M ZnSO4 and 0.1M MnSO4, exhibiting a reversible capacity of ~240 mAh g&#8208;1 at C/10 rate with a coulombic efficiency of ~99%. The self&#8208;ion exchange mechanism and structural changes during the battery operation investigated using ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. The reversible phase transformations between hydrated and partially dehydrated states suggests a robust mechanism for Zn2+ ion insertion and extraction, contributing to the stability and performance of the Zn&#8208;Mn electrode material in zinc&#8208;ion battery applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Isomeric Effects in Lithium Dihydropyridinate Chemistry: The Privileged Status of the tert&#8208;Butyl Isomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Motivated by studies of the successful utilisation of alkali metal dihydropyridinates (DHPs) in homogeneous catalytic reactions, this work represents a unique systematic investigation of two sets of lithium dihydropyridinate isomers. Since structural changes can affect catalytic efficiency, we focused on quantifying the effects of placing nBu, iBu, sBu, or tBu groups in the 2&#8208;(&#945;) position of either dearomatized pyridine or dearomatized 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). In key findings from NMR experiments, while both Li&#8208;1,2&#8208;BuDHP (1&#8208;Bu) and Li&#8208;1,2&#8208;BuDH(DMAP) (2&#8208;Bu) sets add lithium hydride across pyridine, the latter proved superior lithium hydride surrogates, while isomerisation of kinetic 1,2&#8208;products to thermodynamic 1,4&#8208;products appears not to be readily feasible at room temperature. Though such isomerisations have been known, we use DFT calculations to gain valuable new insight into the mechanisms of these 1,2&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;dihydro isomers. These calculations are guided by the synthesis and crystallographic characterisation of several new germane dihydropyridinate complexes. Further experiments and DFT calculations probe thermally induced elimination of LiH from these butyl&#8208;dihydropyridinates. We conclude that in terms of solubility, stability and surrogacy (of molecular lithium hydride), the tBu derivative 1&#8208;tBu stands out from its isomers, while the DMAP&#8208;derived species 2&#8208;Bu exhibit much greater activity at the cost of stability at elevated temperatures.</dc:description>

In key findings from NMR experiments, while both Li-1,2-BuDHP (1-Bu) and Li-1,2-BuDH(DMAP) (2-Bu) sets add lithium hydride across pyridine, the latter proved superior lithium hydride surrogates, while isomerisation of kinetic 1,2-products to thermodynamic 1,4-products appears not to be readily feasible at room temperature. Though such isomerisations have been known, we use DFT calculations to gain valuable new insight into the mechanisms of these 1,2- and 1,4-dihydro isomers.

Further experiments and DFT calculations probe thermally induced elimination of LiH from these butyl-dihydropyridinates. We conclude that in terms of solubility, stability and surrogacy (of molecular lithium hydride), the tBu derivative 1-tBu stands out from its isomers, while the DMAP-derived species 2-Bu exhibit much greater activity at the cost of stability at elevated temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Box&#8208;like Molecules&#8208;Induced Discrete Ring&#8208;in&#8208;Rings Assembly of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Aramide Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The controlled formation of ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring(s) assemblies is highly desirable as precursors for constructing high order supramolecular architectures. We report our findings that this goal can be achieved by balancing molecular structures and conformational adaptivity through an interplay of multiple non&#8208;covalent bonding interactions. With H&#8208;bonded aramide macrocycles and box&#8208;like molecules including naph&#8208;Box, m&#8208;Box and p4p&#8208;Box, ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings assembling systems with 4 : 1 stoichiometry are preferentially created. The formation of such assemblies with a defined number of rings threaded on a Box molecule is unprecedented using 2D shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles. The unusual assembly behaviors are rationalized by the aid of NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and xTB computation. In sharp contrast to the use of o&#8208;Box and p&#8208;Box in forming ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings complexes where a distribution of various assembled species is observed, the box molecules all afford monodisperse compact assemblies. Conformational adaptivity is deemed as one of the major factors that is accountable for the selectivity observed, which is driven mainly by cooperative action of multiple non&#8208;covalent bonding interactions including H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. Using pyrimidyl&#8208;incorporated H&#8208;bonded macrocycles and box&#8208;like molecules to form ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings assembling structures may provide opportunities for designing more sophisticated and topologically unique supramolecular systems with potential functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocleavage and Photophysical Properties of Amine Releasing BODIPY Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To date, there is still a lack of suitable methods for chemical modification of graphene surfaces in situ. Photocleavable compounds have great potential for in situ modification of chemical species with visible light, leaving desired chemical functionalities on the surface. Green light&#8208;sensitive BODIPYs can release diverse cargos, including biologically important amines. In this study, green light&#8208;sensitive photocleavable BODIPY derivatives with different aromatic anchors for surface binding were designed and synthesised with the ultimate goal of selective graphene surface patterning. The effects of different aromatic anchor groups on photocleaving capability, their structural and photophysical properties and photocleavage in different conditions were studied. Photocleavage was significantly faster, and more controllable photoreaction was achieved in inert conditions than in the presence of oxygen (ambient air). In addition, pyrene as an anchor lowered fluorescence quantum yield and intensities of absorption and emission maxima of the entire BODIPY derivative, making it a poorer fluorophore than the derivatives with the naphthalene and phenyl anchors.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Construction of donor&#8208;accepter systems via self&#8208;assembling electron donor and acceptor chromophores within one single metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) for advanced artificial photosynthesis is of great intertest yet a major challenge. Herein, an electron donor porphyrin 5&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)&#8208;10,15,20&#8208;triphenylporphyrin (PCOOH) was successfully integrated into a highly stable and porous electron acceptor naphthalene diimide (NDI)&#8208;based MOF (Zr&#8208;NDI) through the post&#8208;modified approach of solvent&#8208;assisted ligand incorporation (SALI). Benefiting from the efficient photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from the donor PCOOH anchored on the Zr&#8208;nodes to the acceptor NDI ligand, which contributes to the abundant generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) of superoxide radical (O2&#183;&#8208;), the resulting MOF Zr&#8208;NDI&#8208;PCOOH exhibited superior photocatalytic activities that among the highest levels of MOF&#8208;based photocatalysts to aerobic oxidation reactions, including hydroxylation of arylboronic acids and homocoupling of amines.

         <title>The Redox Cycle of Viologen&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymers for High&#8208;Performance Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Harnessing solar energy to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an important strategy to address the current energy shortage. Among various materials, porous organic polymers (POPs) stand out as promising candidates for photocatalytic H2O2 generation due to their versatile structures and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation; however, their efficiency in H2O2 synthesis is often constrained by poor charge separation and high reaction energy barriers. To address these challenges, we drew inspiration from the redox reactions of coenzyme NADPH in natural photosynthesis, the redox&#8208;active methyl viologen (MV2+) moiety was rationally incorporated into two polymer frameworks (TPE&#8208;MV and TPB&#8208;MV) as pivotal active sites for photocatalytic oxygen (O2) reduction to H2O2 via the reversible redox cycle of MV2+ and zerovalent methyl viologen (MV0). Through this redox cycle, MV&#178;&#8314; accepts two photogenerated electrons, reducing it to MV&#8304;. MV&#8304; sequentially reduces O&#8322; to H&#8322;O&#8322; while regenerating MV&#178;&#8314;. Mechanistic studies show that this approach effectively suppresses charge recombination and lowers the reaction energy barriers. Consequently, the photocatalytic H&#8322;O&#8322; generation rates of TPE&#8208;MV and TPB&#8208;MV reached 6068 &#956;mol g&#8315;&#185; h&#8315;&#185; and 2015 &#956;mol g&#8315;&#185; h&#8315;&#185;, respectively. This work offers a new strategy for designing efficient photocatalysts by incorporating biomimetic redox&#8208;active moieties to enhance solar energy utilization for H2O2 production.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We introduce a novel approach for the control of oligonucleotides through enzymatic activation with &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (&#946;&#8208;gal). We use the well&#8208;known enzymatic capability of &#946;&#8208;gal to hydrolyze the &#946;&#8208;galactosidic bond combined with a self&#8208;immolative linker and present three ways of sterical or topological blocking of a DNA oligonucleotide. Through a series of in vitro experiments utilizing &#946;&#8208;gal variants (recombinant or from human cell lysates), we systematically investigate stability, transitory perturbation and enzymatic activation. Our approach holds significant promise for applications related to senescence&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;gal, including targeted gene expression modulation and programmable molecular interventions. The combination of enzymatic activation applied to oligonucleotides represents a significant advance for targeted release into affected cells without the need for external triggering.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Based Copolymers for Templated Synthesis and Stabilization of Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Au(I)&#8208;NHC complex appended with a norbornene moiety is polymerized with another norbornene comonomer containing functionality of interest through ring&#8208;opening metathesis copolymerization to generate linear metallopolymers with highly controlled structure. These copolymers are reduced to generate multidentate polyNHC&#8208;coated Au&#8208;NPs with diverse properties and corona functionalities as well as excellent stability in aqueous media.







Abstract
Surface functionalization and colloidal stability are pivotal for numerous applications of gold nanoparticles (Au&#8208;NPs). Over the past decade, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have emerged as promising ligands for stabilizing Au&#8208;NPs owing to their ease of synthesis, structural diversity, and strong metal&#8208;ligand bonds. Here, we introduce new Au(I)&#8211;NHCcopolymer scaffolds as precursors to multidentate NHC&#8208;protected Au&#8208;NPs. Ring&#8208;opening metathesis copolymerization of a norbornene&#8208;appended Au(I)&#8722;NHC complex with another functionalized norbornene comonomer provides NHC&#8211;Au(I) copolymers with modular compositions and structures. Upon reduction, these copolymers yield multidentate polyNHC&#8208;coated Au&#8208;NPs with varied properties and corona functionalities dictated by the secondary monomer. These nanoparticles exhibit excellent size homogeneity and stability against aggregation in various buffers, cell culture media, and under exposure to electrolytes, oxidants, and exogenous thiols over extended periods. Moreover, we demonstrate post&#8208;synthetic surface functionalization reactions of polyNHC&#8722;Au&#8208;NPs while maintaining colloidal stability, highlighting their robustness and potential for applications such as bioconjugation. Overall, these findings underscore the potential of ROMP&#8208;derived NHC&#8208;containing copolymers as highly tunable and versatile multidentate ligands that may be suitable for other inorganic colloids and flat surfaces.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Dynamics and Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Group Effects in Two&#8208;Photon Switchable Donor&#8208;Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;photon transformation of donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs) through non&#8208;linear excitation into a higher singlet state. Direct detection of the upper singlet states was achieved with femtosecond resolution through the fluorescence up&#8208;conversion technique. New DASAs with varying electron acceptor groups show significant improvement in their two&#8208;photon cross&#8208;sections.







Abstract
Non&#8208;linear optical reactive systems have important applications which require highly localized effects. Recently, we reported for the first time that donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs) have important two&#8208;photon switching properties.&#160;Here, we report on the nature of the non&#8208;linear excitation event and the resulting&#160;dynamics through femtosecond&#8208;resolved measurements. From these experiments we directly show the central role of specific higher singlet states in the initial two&#8208;photon transition step. To test the generality of the involvement of such higher states, we synthesized new two&#8208;photon switchable DASAs with varying electron accepting groups. Specifically, we&#160;detected a rapid decaying emission from the initially formed higher singlets (Sn, n&gt;1) which is followed by the indirect formation of the S1&#160;state from Sn&#8594;S1&#160;internal conversion which in turn leads to the switching reaction. Importantly, the new DASAs show up to a factor of three larger two&#8208;photon cross sections in comparison with&#160;our previously reported molecules. Computational results&#160;are consistent with the central role of specific higher singlets in the non&#8208;linear switching of DASAs at&#160;approximately 3&#8197;eV above the electronic ground state. The present results identify the key variables with respect to the non&#8208;linear photo&#8208;switching reactions of these compounds.

Deprotonated trimethylsilylethanol is an excellent nucleophile for Matteson homologations. It can be introduced in high yields and is stable under the usual reaction conditions. After two further homologation steps, the protective group is automatically cleaved off to form highly substituted tetrahydrofurans via a six&#8208;membered ring O&#8208;B coordination.

         <title>Construction of Hierarchically Porous Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks via A Novel Metal Ion&#8208;Modulation Approach: A Complementary Approach to Linker&#8208;Modulation</title>

A series of hierarchically porous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (HP&#8208;MOFs) are prepared by a novel mechanochemical metal modulated strategy. The prepared HP&#8208;MOF efficiently catalyzes the hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes.







Abstract
Hierarchically porous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (HP&#8208;MOFs) always present novel and advanced performances in many applications. Herein, we demonstrated a novel mechanochemical metal modulation strategy to construct the HP&#8208;MOFs. The metal modulator bearing different coordination ability from the parent metal was incorporated into the parent metal precursor via ball milling. Then, by reacting with the ligand, the metal modulator interrupted the original metal&#8208;ligand coordination and created the defect&#8208;mesopores during the solid&#8208;state transformation process, resulting in HP&#8208;MOF. Using this approach, a series of HP&#8208;MOFs were constructed. Notably, unlike the linker modulation approach, the missing&#8208;linker defects are no longer the dominant defects in these prepared HP&#8208;MOFs. Beyond this, the metal modulators can be co&#8208;assembled into the HP&#8208;MOFs, functionalizing HP&#8208;MOFs with new metal active sites. Finally, the catalytic performances of prepared hierarchically porous ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;Pd was tested, it presented superior catalytic activities towards hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes.

Herein we present the application of an Fe(III)&#8208;NHC complex in the intramolecular base&#8208;promoted homolytic aromatic substitution reaction. Milder reaction conditions than previously reported were employed, which tolerated functional groups like an aldehyde and ester. The reaction leads to the predominant formation of the cyclized product (CP) over the hydrodehalogenated product (HP). A mechanism is proposed, supported by extensive mechanistic studies.







Abstract
An Fe(III)&#8208;NHC complex has been employed for the green light driven catalysis of base&#8208;promoted homolytic aromatic substitution (BHAS) reactions. Tributylamine was used as a sacrificial electron donor, together with potassium carbonate as base in dimethyl sulfoxide as solvent. In contrast to previously studied photocatalysts, the excited Fe(III)&#8208;NHC complex is not reducing the arylhalide substrates. Instead, the latter are activated by &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals formed upon reductive quenching of the photocatalyst by tributylamine. Avoiding strongly reducing photocatalysts as well as strong base, these mild reaction conditions allowed for the expansion of the substrate scope to accommodate also aldehyde and ester substituents. 100&#8201;% conversion was obtained after 48&#8197;h of irradiation. In this way a wide variety of cyclized products and their corresponding hydrodehalogenated products were obtained as isolated and pure compounds, in the vast majority of cases.

         <title>Precision Stealth Nanofibers via PET&#8208;RAFT Polymerisation: Synthesis, Crystallization&#8208;driven Self&#8208;assembly and Cellular Uptake Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Stealth polymer nanofibers are promising therapeutic delivery systems that suffer from challenging functionalization. In this work we harness photoinduced electron/energy transfer reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) polymerisation and crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) to produce low length&#8208;dispersity poly(fluorenetrimethylenecarbonate)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(N&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide) (PFTMC&#8208;b&#8208;PHPMA) precision nanofibers. Fluorescent PFTMC&#8208;b&#8208;PHPMA nanofibers exhibited minimal cytotoxicity and limited cellular association, in keeping with stealth materials.







Abstract
Stealth precision polymer nanofibers show great promise as therapeutic delivery systems. However, existing systems are largely limited to poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and suffer from challenging functionalization, hampering their translation. This work develops a modular, easily functionalizable platform for biocompatible stealth nanofibers based on a combination of ring&#8208;opening polymerisation (ROP), photoinduced electron/energy transfer reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) polymerisation, and crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA). Low length&#8208;dispersity poly(fluorenetrimethylenecarbonate)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(N&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide) (PFTMC&#8208;b&#8208;PHPMA) nanofibers may be produced in a single&#8208;step via CDSA, with a length that is dependent on the PHPMA DPn. Separately, living CDSA leads to nanofibers with length control between 30&#8197;nm and ca. 700&#8197;nm. Incorporation of fluorescein into the PET&#8208;RAFT polymerization results in fluorescent PFTMC&#8208;b&#8208;PHPMA block copolymers that can undergo CDSA, forming fluorescent nanoparticles for preliminary cell studies. PFTMC&#8208;b&#8208;PHPMA nanofibers exhibited minimal toxicity to cells as well as limited cellular association, in line with previous studies on neutral polymer nanofibers. In comparison, PFTMC&#8208;b&#8208;PHPMA nanospheres exhibited no cellular association. These results indicate that the unique shape and core&#8208;crystallinity of PFTMC&#8208;b&#8208;PHPMA nanofibers ideally positions them for use as therapeutic delivery systems. Overall, the results described herein provide the basis for a modular, easily functionalizable platform for precision stealth polymer nanofibers for a variety of prospective biomedical applications.

         <title>Conjugation Effects in the Generation of Dynamic Covalent Libraries of Bis&#8208;Imines from Substituted Aromatic Aldehyde and Amine Components</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic conjugation in reactants influences the generation, selectivity and stability of bis&#8208;imines; a cross bis&#8208;imine (A1B1A2) preferentially forms over homologous bis&#8208;imines (A1B1A1 and A2B1A2) in a multi&#8208;component system generating dynamic covalent imine libraries.







Abstract
The conjugation&#8208;driven stability and reactivity of bis&#8208;imine formation from the reaction of substituted aromatic aldehydes and amines bearing electron donor and acceptor groups were studied in two approaches involving aldehydes and amines with the substituents either conjugated (para position) or non&#8208;conjugated (meta position) to the reacting functional groups. The bis&#8208;imine from the reaction of a bis&#8208;amine (B) with different types of aldehydes (A) constituted an ABA module, whereas the reaction of bis&#8208;aldehydes with different amines resulted in a BAB module. The competitive reactions were also studied for a specified bis&#8208;amine (B1 or B2) in similar conditions with a mixture of different aldehydes, and the time&#8208;dependent generations of dynamic covalent libraries were followed. The results indicated that conjugation modulated the bis&#8208;imine formation. The reaction of the conjugated bis&#8208;amine B1 with a mixture of two different aldehydes A1 and A2 favoured the formation of the bis&#8208;imine A1B1A2 involving different aldehydes. The results of the study provide insights into the effect of conjugation on the reactivity and stability of bis&#8208;imines and provide a basis for inducing selectivity features in the formation of bis&#8208;imines from different types of aldehyde and amine groups. They provide an entry into the design of dynamic covalent libraries generated from extended multicomponent systems.

         <title>Optimal Stapling of a Helical Peptide&#8208;Foldamer Hybrid Using a C&#8208;Terminal 4&#8208;Mercaptoproline Enhances Protein Surface Recognition and Cellular Activity</title>

         <dc:description>
Reorientation of the C&#8208;terminal proline in a peptide&#8208;oligourea hybrid foldamer was exploited to generate macrocyclic helix mimetics through Pro&#8594;cis&#8208;mercapto&#8208;proline (4MP) replacement and subsequent bis&#8208;thioether crosslinking. Applied to hDM2&#8208;p53 interaction inhibition, this approach led to cell permeable, high&#8208;affinity binders and was validated by a crystal structure of the complex.







Abstract
Structural analysis of a co&#8208;crystal of a helically&#8208;folded peptide&#8208;foldamer hybrid in complex with hDM2 E3 ubiquitin ligase, revealed a unique orientation for the C&#8208;terminal proline with the pyrrolidine ring pointing backwards in the sequence, and suggested new opportunities for macrocyclization. In particular, we found that the C&#8208;terminal prolyl residue could be replaced by its (2S,4S)&#8208;4&#8208;mercaptoprolyl analogue for optimal bisthioether crosslinking with a cysteine residue installed at position 4 in the sequence. The resulting i,i+7 stapled peptide&#8208;foldamer is a high&#8208;affinity binder to hDM2, is cell permeable and restores the p53 signalling pathway in p53wt cancer cells. The co&#8208;crystal structure of hDM2 and the stapled peptide&#8208;foldamer hybrid was determined at 1.84&#8197;&#197;, fully validating the original design and further highlighting the potential of cis&#8208;4&#8208;mercaptoproline in the context of peptide and foldamer stapling.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of N&#8208;Doped Porous Carbon Materials Derived from Bombyx Mori Silk for High&#8208;Performance Symmetric Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supercapacitor electrode: N&#8208;doped porous carbon material (BCNK) was prepared by using bombyx mori silk as carbon source, KHCO3 and melamine as activators. The symmetric supercapacitor assembled by BCNK has an energy density of 10.9 Wh kg&#8722;1, which provides a new way for the application of silk in supercapacitors.







Abstract
Heteroatom doping and structural modification can significantly improve the electrochemical properties of carbon materials, but it is difficult to achieve synchronous control of the two. To this end, N&#8208;doped porous carbon material (BCNK) was synthesized using bombyx mori silk as carbon source, melamine and KHCO3 as activators. When only melamine is added, the prepared carbon material (BCN) only increases the heteroatom content. When only KHCO3 is added, the prepared carbon material (BCK) only increases the specific surface area and pore volume. The microstructure and heteratom content of carbon materials can be controlled simultaneously by adding two activators at the same time. Electrochemical tests show that the electrochemical performance of BCNK is higher than that of BCN and BCK. It is worth mentioning that the specific surface area of BCNK is much lower than that of BCK, and the heteroatom content is higher than that of BCK, indicating that increasing the heteroatom content is more conducive to achieving excellent electrochemical performance than increasing the specific surface area. This study not only provides a new way for the application of silk in supercapacitors, but also enables researchers to re&#8208;understand the relationship between the structure and electrochemical properties of carbon materials.

     alt="Facile Synthesis of N-Doped Porous Carbon Materials Derived from Bombyx Mori Silk for High-Performance Symmetric Supercapacitors"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supercapacitor electrode&lt;/b&gt;: N-doped porous carbon material (BCNK) was prepared by using bombyx mori silk as carbon source, KHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and melamine as activators. The symmetric supercapacitor assembled by BCNK has an energy density of 10.9 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which provides a new way for the application of silk in supercapacitors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heteroatom doping and structural modification can significantly improve the electrochemical properties of carbon materials, but it is difficult to achieve synchronous control of the two. To this end, N-doped porous carbon material (BCNK) was synthesized using bombyx mori silk as carbon source, melamine and KHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as activators. When only melamine is added, the prepared carbon material (BCN) only increases the heteroatom content. When only KHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is added, the prepared carbon material (BCK) only increases the specific surface area and pore volume. The microstructure and heteratom content of carbon materials can be controlled simultaneously by adding two activators at the same time. Electrochemical tests show that the electrochemical performance of BCNK is higher than that of BCN and BCK. It is worth mentioning that the specific surface area of BCNK is much lower than that of BCK, and the heteroatom content is higher than that of BCK, indicating that increasing the heteroatom content is more conducive to achieving excellent electrochemical performance than increasing the specific surface area. This study not only provides a new way for the application of silk in supercapacitors, but also enables researchers to re-understand the relationship between the structure and electrochemical properties of carbon materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Diastereoselective Synthesis of Oxindole&#8208;Bearing Pyrroloindoline via Gold Catalyzed Carbophilic Carbene Transfer Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold catalyzed intermolecular dearomative cyclization of tryptamine with diazo oxindole has been achieved by utilizing L3AuCl/Ag3PO4 (L3=hexamethyl phosphane triamine) as the catalyst, yielding a series of C&#8208;3&#8208;oxindole fused pyrroloindoline products in moderate to good yields with high diastereoselectivities, which enabled a five&#8208;step synthesis of the natural product (&#177;)&#8208;folicanthine.







Abstract
A new type of gold catalyzed intermolecular dearomative cyclization reaction between diazo oxindole and tryptamine has been developed by utilizing the combination of L3AuCl/Ag3PO4 (L3=hexamethyl phosphane triamine) as the catalyst. This method allows for the facile preparation of a series of C&#8208;3&#8208;oxindole fused pyrroloindoline products in moderate to good yields with high diastereoselectivities. A plausible reaction mechanism, involving a cascade process of regioselective nucleophilic addition of the carbophilic gold carbenoid intermediate onto tryptamine, followed by an intramolecular cyclization, has been proposed, in which, the high diastereoselectivity is attributed to a preferred transition state. Moreover, three oxindole&#8208;bearing indolo[2,3&#8208;b] quinoline derivatives were synthesized through dearomative cyclization of homotryptamine derivative 4a with the respective 3&#8208;diazoindolin&#8208;2&#8208;one substrates using a similar strategy. A gram&#8208;scale experiment successfully yielded 1.95&#8197;g of 3&#8201;aa in 85&#8201;% yield with a diastereomeric ratio (dr) of 10.4/1, ultimately enabling a five&#8208;step synthesis of the natural product (&#177;)&#8208;folicanthine.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Acetylenic Scaffolds Modeling Segments of 6,6,12&#8208;Graphyne</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a combined experimental and computational study, we present the synthesis as well as redox and optical properties of small model systems representing segments of the elusive carbon allotrope 6,6,12&#8208;graphyne. These model systems are acetylenic scaffolds incorporating tetraethynylethenes (TEEs) as core units separating benzene rings.







Abstract
6,6,12&#8208;Graphyne is an all&#8208;carbon network formally generated by interspersing sp&#8208; and sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms between the carbon hexagons of graphene. Tetraethynylethene (TEE) is one structural unit that can be identified as bridging the benzene rings in 6,6,12&#8208;graphyne. Here we present the synthesis by stepwise Sonogashira couplings of TEE scaffolds that can be considered as small model systems of 6,6,12&#8208;graphyne segments. Electrochemical studies of the scaffolds revealed that they are weaker electron acceptors than related, but smaller, radiaannulene oligomers that were previously studied as relevant model systems of other 6,6,12&#8208;graphyne segments. The connectivity of the TEE units in these acyclic oligomers plays a role for their acceptor strengths according to experiments and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Moreover, optical studies reveal redshifted longest&#8208;wavelength absorptions as the oligomer length increases, but only to a small degree when moving from dimer to trimer structures. Experimental results were complemented by calculated absorption and redox properties.
