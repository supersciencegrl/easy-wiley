         <title>Unravelling the Role of the Pentafluoroorthotellurate Group as a Ligand in Nickel Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pentafluoroorthotellurate group (teflate, OTeF5) is able to form species, for which only the fluoride analogues are known. Despite nickel fluorides being widely investigated, nickel teflates have remained elusive for decades. By reaction of [NiCl4]2&#8211; and neat ClOTeF5, we have synthesized the homoleptic [Ni(OTeF5)4]2&#8211; anion, which presents a distorted tetrahedral structure, unlike the polymeric [NiF4]2&#8211;. This high&#8208;spin complex has allowed the study of the electronic properties of the teflate group, which can be classified as a weak/medium&#8208;field ligand, and therefore behaves as the fluoride analogue also in ligand&#8208;field terms. The teflate ligands in [NEt4]2[Ni(OTeF5)4] are easily substituted, as shown by the formation of [Ni(NCMe)6][OTeF5]2 by dissolving it in acetonitrile. Nevertheless, careful reactions with other conventional ligands have enabled the crystallization of nickel teflate complexes with different coordination geometries, i.e. [NEt4]2[trans&#8208;Ni(OEt2)2(OTeF5)4] or [NEt4][Ni(bpyMe2)(OTeF5)3].</dc:description>

         <title>Bioorthogonal Click of Colloidal Gold Nanoparticles to Antibodies In Vivo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combining nanotechnology and bioorthogonal chemistry for theranostic strategies offers the possibility to develop next generation nanomedicines. These materials are thought to increase therapeutic outcome and improve current cancer management. Due to their size, nanomedicines target tumors passively. Thus, they can be used for drug delivery purposes. Bioorthogonal chemistry opens up for pretargeting. Higher target&#8208;to&#8208;background drug accumulation ratios can be achieved. Pretargeting can also be used to induce internalization processes or trigger controlled drug release. Colloidal gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have attracted widespread interest as drug delivery vectors within the last decades. Here, we demonstrate &#8208; for the first time &#8208; the possibility to successfully ligate AuNPs in vivo to pretargeted monoclonal antibodies. We believe that this possibility will facilitate the development of AuNPs for clinical use and ultimately, improve state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art patient care.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics in the Ionothermal Synthesis for Nucleation of Crystalline Potassium Poly(heptazine imide) Towards an Enhanced Solar&#8208;Driven H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven selective oxygen reduction reaction on polymeric carbon nitride framework is one of the most promising approaches toward sustainable H  2  O  2  production. Potassium poly(heptazine imide) (PHI), with regular metal sites in the framework and favorable crystalline structure, is highly active for photocatalytic selective 2e oxygen reduction to produce H  2&#173;  O  2  . By introducing NH  4  Cl into the eutectic KCl&#8208;LiCl salt mixture, the PHI framework exhibits a remarkable performance for photocatalytic production of H  2  O  2  , e.g., a record high H  2  O  2  photo&#8208;production rate of 29.5  &#956;mol h  &#8722;1  mg  &#8722;1  . The efficient photocatalytic performance is attributed to the favorable properties of the new PHI framework, such as improved porosity, negatively shifted LUMO position, enhanced exciton dissociation and charges migration properties  .  A mechanistic investigation by quenching and electron spin resonance technique reveals the critical role of superoxide radicals for the formation singlet oxygen, and the singlet oxygen is one of the critical intermediates towards the formation of the H  2  O  2  by proton extraction from the ethanol.</dc:description>

         <title>Indole&#8208;based long&#8208;wavelength fluorescent probes for bioimaging of S&#8208;nitrosylation in mitochondria</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>S  &#8208;Nitrosylation has been found to play an important role in regulating mitochondrial function. However, probes for detection of protein  S  &#8208;nitrosylation in mitochondria remain unexplored. Herein, a novel 4&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)vinyl&#8208;substituted indole was designed, exhibiting a long&#8208;wavelength emission and a high fluorescent quantum yield. Functionalization of the 7&#8208;position of the indole ring with an arylphosphine ester resulted with probes with efficient mitochondria&#8208;targeting ability. Furthermore, the indole&#8208;arylphosphine displayed a significant fluorescence enhancement upon exposure to  S  &#8208;nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) at low micromolar concentrations in A431 cells. Taken together, this study provides a new indole&#8208;based fluorescent probe with a unique long&#8208;wavelength emission for direct detection of  S  &#8208;nitrosylation in mitochondria, which may represent a powerful tool for understanding the critical roles of  S  &#8208;nitrosylation within mitochondria of living organisms.</dc:description>

         <title>A Tumor&#8208;Targeting Dual&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Activatable Photodynamic Molecular Beacon for Precise Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A multifunctional&#160;photodynamic molecular beacon (PMB) has been designed and synthesized which contains an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)&#8208;targeting cyclic peptide and a trimeric phthalocyanine skeleton in which the three zinc(II) phthalocyanine units are each substituted with a glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive 2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzenesulfonate (DNBS) quencher and are linked&#160;via&#160;two cathepsin B&#8208;cleavable GFLG peptide chains. This tailor&#8208;made conjugate is fully quenched in the native form due to the photoinduced electron transfer effect of the DNBS moieties and the self&#8208;quenching of the phthalocyanine units. It can target the EGFR overexpressed in cancer cells, and after receptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis, it can be activated selectively by the co&#8208;existence of intracellular GSH and cathepsin B, both of which are also overproduced in cancer cells, in terms of fluorescence emission and singlet oxygen generation. The cell&#8208;selective behavior of this PMB has been demonstrated using a range of cancer cells with different expression levels of EGFR, while the stimuli&#8208;responsive properties have been studied both&#160;in vitro&#160;and in various aqueous media. The overall results show that this advanced PMB, which exhibits several levels of control of the tumor specificity, is a promising photosensitizer for precise antitumoral photodynamic therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Preparation of CsPbBr3@CsPb2Br5 Composite Assisted with Water as a Highly Efficient and Stable Catalyst for Photothermal CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead halide perovskite has triggered a lot of research due to its superior optical properties. However, halide perovskite materials have poor environmental stabilities and are easily affected by external factors such as water and heat, resulting in structural decomposition and performance failure. Contrary to this commonplace concept, CsPbBr3 can convert to CsPb2Br5 partially when meeting a small amount of water, and the CsPbBr3@CsPb2Br5 composite is synthesized by an in&#8197;situ method accordingly. The CsPbBr3@CsPb2Br5 composite shows an enhanced catalytic performance compared with pure CsPbBr3, as well as a dramatically synergistic effect of photo and thermal for catalytic CO2 hydrogenation.







Abstract
Lead halide perovskite has triggered a lot of research due to its superior optical properties. However, halide perovskite materials have poor environmental stabilities and are easily affected by external factors such as water and heat, resulting in structural decomposition and performance failure. Contrary to this commonplace concept, it is found that CsPbBr3 (CPB) can convert to CsPb2Br5 (CP2B5) partially when meeting a small amount of water, and the CsPbBr3@CsPb2Br5 (CPB@CP2B5) composite is synthesized by an in&#8197;situ method accordingly. The CPB@CP2B5 composite shows an enhanced catalytic performance compared with pure CPB, as well as a dramatically synergistic effect of photo and thermal for catalytic CO2 hydrogenation. The CO production rate of CPB@CP2B5 is determined as 69&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under light irradiation at 200&#8201;&#176;C, which is 156.8 and 43.4 times higher than that under pure photo (0.44&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h &#8722;1) and pure thermal (1.59&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h &#8722;1) condition, respectively. Meanwhile, the CPB@CP2B5 sample is also stable, which shows no significant decline in the catalytic activity during 8 cycles of repeated experiments. The probable mechanism is explored by utilizing a series of in&#8197;situ characterizations.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Based Materials as Lithium Hosts for Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to their low costs, high specific surface areas, high electrical conductivities, and wide electrochemical stabilities, carbon&#8208;based materials are prime candidates for use as Li hosts. This concept article describes a series of structurally&#8208;unique carbon&#8208;based materials that have been used in Li storage applications and includes an examination of the underlying mechanisms of Li dendrite growth and suppression as well as an outlook for the field.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal has attracted significant attention in areas that range from basic research to various commercial applications due to its high theoretical specific capacity (3860&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1) and low electrochemical potential (&#8722;3.04 vs. standard hydrogen electrode). However, dendrites often form on the surfaces of Li metal anodes during cycling and thus lead to battery failure and, in some cases, raise safety concerns. To overcome this problem, a variety of approaches that vary the electrolyte, membrane, and/or anode have been proposed. Among these efforts, the use of three&#8208;dimensional frameworks as Li hosts, which can homogenize and minimize the current density at the anode surface, is an effective approach to suppress the formation of Li dendrites. Herein, we describe the development of using carbon&#8208;based materials as Li hosts. While these materials can be fabricated into a variety of porous structures, they have a number of intrinsic advantages including low costs, high specific surface areas, high electrical conductivities, and wide electrochemical stabilities. After briefly summarizing the formation mechanisms of Li dendrites, various methods for controlling structural and surface chemistry will be described for different types of carbon&#8208;based materials from the viewpoint of improving their performance as Li hosts. Finally, we provide perspective on the future development of Li host materials needed to meet the requirements for their use in flexible and wearable devices and other contemporary energy storage techniques.

         <title>Layered Oxide Cathodes Promoted by Crystal Regulation Strategies for Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal (TM) layered oxides with rigid frameworks and two&#8208;dimensional ion diffusion pathways have been extensively studied in potassium&#8208;ion batteries. To improve their potassium storage properties, a series of crystal tuning strategies have been developed, including TM layer regulation, potassium and oxygen layers regulation, construction of hierarchical structure, air&#8208;stabilized TM layered oxides.







Abstract
Layered oxide cathodes have demonstrated great potential for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) on account of high reversible capacity, appropriate diffusion paths, and low cost. However, their electrochemical performance in PIBs is generally worse than that in lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to large structural changes and deformations during charging and discharging. To improve their potassium storage performance, a series of strategies have been developed in recent studies. In this review, we summarize the latest advancements in layered oxide cathodes for PIBs through different crystal regulation strategies, including transition metal layer doping, potassium content optimization, oxygen partial substitution, functional morphology construction and air stability improvement. Meanwhile, the relationship between the electrochemical properties and structural evolution of these modified cathodes is also investigated. In addition, the challenges and prospects of these layered oxide cathodes in PIBs are analyzed in detail, providing constructive insights for future applications of PIBs.

         <title>Suppression of Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation and Aggregation of Antibodies by Modest Pressure Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrostatic pressures of a few tens of to hundred bar are sufficient to suppress liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation and subsequent aggregation and fibril formation of immunoglobulins. The immunoglobulin molecules themselves are highly resistant to unfolding under pressure, however, so the immunological activity of foods processed under high pressure is preserved.







Abstract
The high colloidal stability of antibody (immunoglobulin) solutions is important for pharmaceutical applications. Inert cosolutes, excipients, are generally used in therapeutic protein formulations to minimize physical instabilities, such as liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS), aggregation and precipitation, which are often encountered during manufacturing and storage. Despite their widespread use, a detailed understanding of how excipients modulate the specific protein&#8208;protein interactions responsible for these instabilities is still lacking. In this work, we demonstrate the high sensitivity to pressure of globulin condensates as a suitable means to suppress LLPS and subsequent aggregation of concentrated antibody solutions. The addition of excipients has only a minor effect. The high pressure sensitivity observed is due to the fact that these flexible Y&#8208;shaped molecules create a considerable amount of void volume in the condensed phase, leading to an overall decrease in the volume of the system upon dissociation of the droplet phase by pressure already at a few tens of to hundred bar. Moreover, we show that immunoglobulin molecules themselves are highly resistant to unfolding under pressure, and can even sustain pressures up to about 6&#8197;kbar without conformational changes. This implies that immunoglobulins are resistant to the pressure treatment of foods, such as milk, in high&#8208;pressure food&#8208;processing technologies, thereby preserving their immunological activity.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Mediated Arbuzov&#8208;Like Reaction with Thiophenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light mediated Arbuzov type reaction of thiophenols and phosphites to access phosphorothioates under mild metal&#8208;free conditions was demonstrated.







Abstract
We hereby disclose, a visible light mediated addition of sulfenyl radicals to trialkyl phosphites to access functionalized phosphorothioates. The use of cheap and readily available Eosin Y as a photocatalyst under mild energy efficient conditions bypassing the use of external oxidants forms the chief highlight of the work. The protocol is scalable and mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction proceeds through an ionic&#8208;Arbuzov like pathway from phosphoranyl radicals.

         <title>Targeting Pathogenic DNA and RNA Repeats: A Conceptual Therapeutic Way for Repeat Expansion Diseases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unusual structures of DNA and RNA repeats play a key role in the development of some human neurodegenerative diseases which are also called as repeat expansion diseases. Therapeutic targeting of these pathogenic DNA and RNA repeats with small&#8208;molecule drugs offers a potential way to cure repeat expansion diseases.







Abstract
Expansions of short tandem repeats (STRs) in the human genome cause nearly 50 neurodegenerative diseases, which are mostly inheritable, nonpreventable and incurable, posing as a huge threat to human health. Non&#8208;B DNAs formed by STRs are thought to be structural intermediates that can cause repeat expansions. The subsequent transcripts harboring expanded RNA repeats can further induce cellular toxicity through forming specific structures. Direct targeting of these pathogenic DNA and RNA repeats has emerged as a new potential therapeutic strategy to cure repeat expansion diseases. In this conceptual review, we first introduce the roles of DNA and RNA structures in the genetic instabilities and pathomechanisms of repeat expansion diseases, then describe structural features of DNA and RNA repeats with a focus on the tertiary structures determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography and solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and finally discuss recent progress and perspectives of developing chemical tools that target pathogenic DNA and RNA repeats for curing repeat expansion diseases.

         <title>In Situ Observation of Hot Carrier Transfer at Plasmonic Au/Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) Interfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MOF structures possess the advantage of molecular&#8208;level tunability via functionalization of both secondary building units (SBUs) and organic ligands, which manipulate interface charge transfer and separation on plasmonic photocatalysts. It is observed that hot electrons on Au can be captured by the coordinatively unsaturated sites of SBUs in MOF structures, while hot holes on Au tend to transfer to and be trapped at the functionalized organic ligand.







Abstract
Constructing heterostructures have been demonstrated as an ideal strategy for boosting charge separation on plasmonic photocatalysts, but the detailed interface charge transfer mechanism remains elusive. Herein, that authors fabricate plasmonic Au and metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs, NH2&#8722;MIL&#8208;125 and MIL&#8208;125 used in this work) heterostructures and explore the interface charge transfer mechanism by in&#8197;situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and electrochemical measurements. The plasmon&#8208;excited hot electrons on Au can transfer across the Au/MOF interface and be captured by the coordinatively unsaturated sites of secondary building units (Ti8O8(OH)4 cluster) of the MOF structure, and the plasmon&#8208;excited hot holes on Au tend to transfer to and be trapped at the functionalized organic ligand (1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate&#8722;NH2). The spatially separated hot electrons and holes exhibit boosted the photocatalytic activity for chromium (VI) reduction and selective benzyl alcohol oxidation. This work illustrates the advantage of the versatile functionalization of MOF structures enabling molecular&#8208;level manipulation of interface charge transfer on plasmonic photocatalysts.

         <title>Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting of Black Silicon Photoanode by pH&#8208;Dependent Copper&#8208;Bipyridine Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the water oxidation half&#8208;reaction requires the transfer of multi&#8208;electrons and the formation of O&#8208;O bond, it&#8217;s crucial to investigate the catalytic behaviours of semiconductor photoanodes. In this work, a bio&#8208;inspired copper&#8208;bipyridine catalyst of Cu(dcbpy) is decorated on the nanoporous Si photoanode (black Si,  b  &#8208;Si). Under AM1.5G illumination, the  b  &#8208;Si/Cu(dcbpy) photoanode exhibits a high photocurrent density of 6.31 mA cm  &#8208;2  at 1.5 V  RHE  at pH 11.0, which is dramatically improved from the  b  &#8208;Si photoanode (1.03 mA cm  &#8208;2  ) and  f  &#8208;Si photoanode (0.0087 mA cm  &#8208;2  ). Mechanism studies demonstrate that  b  &#8208;Si/Cu(dcbpy) has improved light&#8208;harvesting, interfacial charge&#8208;transfer, and surface area for water splitting. More interestingly,  b  &#8208;Si/Cu(dcbpy) exhibits a pH&#8208;dependent water oxidation behaviour with a minimum Tafel slope of 241 mV/dec and the lowest overpotential of 0.19 V at pH 11.0, which is due to the monomer/dimer equilibrium of copper catalyst. At pH ~11, the formation of dimeric hydroxyl&#8208;complex could form O&#8208;O bond through a redox isomerization (RI) mechanism, which decreases the required potential for water oxidation. This in&#8208;depth understanding of pH&#8208;dependent water oxidation catalyst brings insights into the design of dimer water oxidation catalysts and efficient photoanodes for solar energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding Catch and Release DNA Decoy (CRDD) Technology with Pyrimidine Mimics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catch and Release DNA Decoys (CRDDs) utilize photochemically responsive nucleoside analogues that generate abasic sites upon exposure to light. Herein, we describe the synthesis and evaluation of four candidate CRDD monomers containing nucleobases that mimic endogenous pyrimidines: 2&#8208;nitroimidazole (2NI), 2&#8208;nitrobenzene (2&#8208;NB), 2&#8208;nitropyrrole (2&#8208;NP) and 3&#8208;nitropyrrole (3&#8208;NP). Our studies reveal that 2&#8208;NI and 2&#8208;NP can function as CRDDs, whereas 3&#8208;NP and 2&#8208;NB undergo decomposition and transformation to a higher&#8208;ordered structure upon photolysis, respectively. When incorporated into DNA, 2&#8208;NP undergoes rapid photochemical cleavage of the anomeric bond (1.8 min half&#8208;life) to yield an abasic site. Finally, we find that all four pyrimidine mimics show significantly greater stability when base&#8208;paired against the previously reported, 7&#8208;nitroindole CRDD monomer. Our work marks the expansion of CRDD technology to both purine and pyrimidine scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of the Intramolecular Hydrogen Bond on the Fluorescence of 2&#8208;ortho&#8208;Aminophenyl Pyridines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dynamic nature of Excited State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT) and its effect on the emission spectrum is an attractive strategy to create multi&#8208;emissive dyes. Here we describe the behavior of a series of hydrogen&#8208;bonded triphenylpyridines having a set of donor&#8208;acceptor combinations that allowed us to perceive the influence of each substitution on the photophysical properties of the dyes. The susceptibility of these ESIPT moieties to pH variations was also studied, elucidating that the level of protonation had a significant effect on the emission colour. The assignment of each emission band was made using DFT and td&#8208;DFT calculations that were in agreement with the experimental results. This study emphasizes the versatility of triphenylpyridines that can be synthetized effortlessly with logical C&#8208;2, C&#8208;4 and C&#8208;6 independent substitution, in order to have the desired ESIPT modulation and subsequent multi&#8208;emission response.</dc:description>

         <title>Role of Phosphonate Ligand Length and Solution Temperature in the Colloidal Stability of TiO2 Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface ligands are essential tools for the stabilization of colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) in solvents. However, knowledge regarding the effects of the ligand shell, especially the ligand length, is insufficient and controversial. Here we demonstrate solution&#8208;based experiments on  n&#8208;  alkylphosphonate&#8208;capped TiO  2  NPs to investigate the effects of ligand length and solution temperature on colloidal stability. A robust ligand exchange process is achieved, which enables free ligands and impurities away from the colloidal solution. In the case of 8 nm anatase NPs in toluene, the dodecylphosphonate ligand provided better colloidal stability than all the other  n&#8208;  alkylphosphonate ligands. In addition, relaxation studies suggested there is kinetic hysteresis in the dispersion/agglomeration transition. The proposed method is applicable to a wide range of surface ligands designed to maximize the colloidal stability of NPs.</dc:description>

The proposed method is applicable to a wide range of surface ligands designed to maximize the colloidal stability of NPs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineered heme protein biocatalysts provide an efficient and sustainable approach to develop amine&#8208;containing compounds through C&#8208;H amination. A quantum chemical study to reveal the complete heme catalyzed intramolecular C&#8208;H amination pathway and protein axial ligand effect was reported, using reactions of an experimentally used arylsulfonylazide with hemes containing L = none, SH  &#8208;  , MeO  &#8208;  , and MeOH to simulate no axial ligand, negatively charged Cys and Ser ligands, and a neutral ligand for comparison. Nitrene formation was found as the overall rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) and the catalyst with Ser ligand has the best reactivity, consistent with experimental reports. Both RDS and non&#8208;RDS (nitrene transfer) transition states follow the barrier trend of MeO  &#8208;  &lt; SH  &#8208;  &lt; MeOH &lt; None due to the charge donation capability of the axial ligand to influence the key charge transfer process as the electronic driving forces. Results also provide new ideas for future biocatalyst design with enhanced reactivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Insight into the Structural Variation and Sodium Storage Behavior of Polyoxometalates Encapsulated within Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The host&#8208;guest interaction can remarkably alter the physiochemical properties of composite materials. It is crucial to clarify the mechanism by revealing the influence of the host on the electronic structure of the guest molecules. Herein, we study the structural variation of polyoxometalates (POMs) after being confined in single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT). What we found is that in addition to the reported charge transfer from SWNT to POM, an intramolecular electron transfer within a single POM cluster can be observed in the POM@SWNT composites. Moreover, the charge density on the bridged oxygen&#160;of POMs is prominently enhanced. The structural change and electron reconfiguration of POMs upon encapsulation in SWNT significantly speed up electron and ion transport, leading to the improved electrochemical performance for sodium ions storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Homolytic X&#8208;H Bond Cleavage at a Gold(III) Hydroxide: Insights into One&#8208;Electron Events at Gold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 40, July 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of homolytic X&#8208;H bond cleavage by a Au(III)&#8208;OH complex was investigated computationally. Both C&#8722;H and O&#8722;H bonds are cleaved via a concerted proton coupled electron transfer mechanism (cPCET) rather than a hydrogen atom transfer mechanism (HAT). The results suggest that one&#8208;electron events at gold may be more accessible than anticipated.







Abstract
C(sp3)&#8208;H and O&#8722;H bond breaking steps in the oxidation of 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene and phenol by a Au(III)&#8208;OH complex were studied computationally. The analysis reveals that for both types of bonds the initial X&#8722;H cleavage step proceeds via concerted proton coupled electron transfer (cPCET), reflecting electron transfer from the substrate directly to the Au(III) centre and proton transfer to the Au&#8208;bound oxygen. This mechanistic picture is distinct from the analogous formal Cu(III)&#8208;OH complexes studied by the Tolman group (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2019, 141, 17236&#8211;17244), which proceed via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) for C&#8722;H bonds and cPCET for O&#8722;H bonds. Hence, care should be taken when transferring concepts between Cu&#8722;OH and Au&#8722;OH species. Furthermore, the ability of Au&#8722;OH complexes to perform cPCET suggests further possibilities for one&#8208;electron chemistry at the Au centre, for which only limited examples exist.

         <title>Methyl Viologens of Bis&#8208;(4&#8217;&#8208;Pyridylethynyl)Arenes &#8211; Structures, Photophysical and Electrochemical Studies, and their Potential Application in Biology</title>

         <dc:description>
Methyl&#8208;viologens containing &#960;&#8208;extended bis(N&#8208;methylpyridiniumethynyl)arenes (arene=benzene, tetrafluorobenzene, anthracene) were crystallographically characterized and their electrochemical properties and one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon absorption and fluorescence spectra were measured. With DNA/RNA, while the benzene and tetrafluorobenzene analogues bind in grooves, the anthracene analogue intercalates due to its large aromatic moiety, and aggregates within the polynucleotide when in excess over DNA/RNA. The latter compound localizes within lysosomes, preventing its interaction with cellular DNA/RNA, but exhibited cytotoxicity upon photoexcitation, due to 1O2 generation within cells.







Abstract
A series of bis&#8208;(4&#8217;&#8208;pyridylethynyl)arenes (arene=benzene, tetrafluorobenzene, and anthracene) were synthesized and their bis&#8208;N&#8208;methylpyridinium compounds were investigated as a class of &#960;&#8208;extended methyl viologens. Their structures were determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, and their photophysical and electrochemical properties (cyclic voltammetry), as well as their interactions with DNA/RNA were investigated. The dications showed bathochromic shifts in emission compared to the neutral compounds. The neutral compounds showed very small Stokes shifts, which are a little larger for the dications. All of the compounds showed very short fluorescence lifetimes (&lt;4&#8197;ns). The neutral compound with an anthracene core has a quantum yield of almost unity. With stronger acceptors, the analogous bis&#8208;N&#8208;methylpyridinium compound showed a larger two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section than its neutral precursor. All of the dicationic compounds interact with DNA/RNA; while the compounds with benzene and tetrafluorobenzene cores bind in the grooves, the one with an anthracene core intercalates as a consequence of its large, condensed aromatic linker moiety, and it aggregates within the polynucleotide when in excess over DNA/RNA. Moreover, all cationic compounds showed highly specific CD spectra upon binding to ds&#8208;DNA/RNA, attributed to the rare case of forcing the planar, achiral molecule into a chiral rotamer, and negligible toxicity toward human cell lines at &#8804;10&#8197;&#956;M concentrations. The anthracene&#8208;analogue exhibited intracellular accumulation within lysosomes, preventing its interaction with cellular DNA/RNA. However, cytotoxicity was evident at 1&#8197;&#956;M concentration upon exposure to light, due to singlet oxygen generation within cells. These multi&#8208;faceted features, in combination with its two&#8208;photon absorption properties, suggest it to be a promising lead compound for development of novel light&#8208;activated theranostic agents.

With DNA/RNA, while the benzene and tetrafluorobenzene analogues bind in grooves, the anthracene analogue intercalates due to its large aromatic moiety, and aggregates within the polynucleotide when in excess over DNA/RNA. The latter compound localizes within lysosomes, preventing its interaction with cellular DNA/RNA, but exhibited cytotoxicity upon photoexcitation, due to &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation within cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of bis-(4&#8217;-pyridylethynyl)arenes (arene=benzene, tetrafluorobenzene, and anthracene) were synthesized and their bis-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylpyridinium compounds were investigated as a class of &#960;-extended methyl viologens. Their structures were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction, and their photophysical and electrochemical properties (cyclic voltammetry), as well as their interactions with DNA/RNA were investigated. The dications showed bathochromic shifts in emission compared to the neutral compounds. The neutral compounds showed very small Stokes shifts, which are a little larger for the dications. All of the compounds showed very short fluorescence lifetimes (&amp;lt;4&#8197;ns). The neutral compound with an anthracene core has a quantum yield of almost unity. With stronger acceptors, the analogous bis-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylpyridinium compound showed a larger two-photon absorption cross-section than its neutral precursor. All of the dicationic compounds interact with DNA/RNA; while the compounds with benzene and tetrafluorobenzene cores bind in the grooves, the one with an anthracene core intercalates as a consequence of its large, condensed aromatic linker moiety, and it aggregates within the polynucleotide when in excess over DNA/RNA. Moreover, all cationic compounds showed highly specific CD spectra upon binding to ds-DNA/RNA, attributed to the rare case of forcing the planar, achiral molecule into a chiral rotamer, and negligible toxicity toward human cell lines at &#8804;10&#8197;&#956;M concentrations. The anthracene-analogue exhibited intracellular accumulation within lysosomes, preventing its interaction with cellular DNA/RNA. However, cytotoxicity was evident at 1&#8197;&#956;M concentration upon exposure to light, due to singlet oxygen generation within cells. These multi-faceted features, in combination with its two-photon absorption properties, suggest it to be a promising lead compound for development of novel light-activated theranostic agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A New Look at Molecular and Electronic Structure of Homoleptic Diiron(II,II) Complexes with N,N&#8208;Bidentate Ligands: Combined Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 40, July 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new factors governing the molecular and electronic structures of Fe&#8722;Fe bonded diiron(II,II) complexes were revealed based on comprehensive experimental characterization along with high&#8208;level ab&#8208;intio calculations. We present the unprecedented non&#8208;centrosymmetric complex [Fe(&#956;&#8208;DTolF)3Fe(&#954;2&#8208;DTolF)], and the new electronic configuration of paddlewheel&#8208;type compound [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;DPhF)4].







Abstract
Paddlewheel&#8208;type binuclear complexes featuring metal&#8722;metal bonding have been the subject of widespread interest due to fundamental concern in their electronic structures and potential applications. Here, we explore the molecular and electronic structures of diiron(II,II) complexes with N,N&#8217;&#8208;diarylformamidinate ligands. While a paddlewheel&#8208;type diiron(II,II) complex with N,N&#8217;&#8208;diphenylformamidinate ligands (DPhF) exhibits the centrosymmetric [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;DPhF)4] structure, a minor alteration in the ligand system, i.&#8201;e., switching from phenyl to p&#8208;tolyl N&#8208;substituted formamidinate ligand (DTolF), resulted in the isolation of an unprecedented non&#8208;centrosymmetric [Fe(&#956;&#8208;DTolF)3Fe(&#954;2&#8208;DTolF)] complex. Both complexes were characterized using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, magnetic measurements, 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry along with high&#8208;level ab&#8208;initio calculations. The results provide a new view on a range of factors controlling the ground&#8208;state electronic configuration and structural diversity of homoleptic diiron(II,II) complexes. Model calculations determined that the Mayer bond orders for Fe&#8722;Fe interactions are significantly lower than 1 and equal to 0.15 and 0.28 for [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;DPhF)4] and [Fe(&#956;&#8208;DTolF)3Fe(&#954;2&#8208;DTolF)], respectively.

A new hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskite (HOIP) with two&#8208;step dielectric response, meanwhile, it emits charming green light under 365&#8197;nm lamp (Photoluminescence quantum yield is 9.52&#8201;%). The outstanding two&#8208;step dielectric response and luminescence characteristics of this compound might pave the way for the application of dielectric and ferroelectric functional materials in temperature sensors and mechanical switches.







Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskite (HOIP) have received tremendous scientific attention because of the phase transition and photovoltaic properties. However, achieving the special perovskite structure with both two&#8208;step dielectric response and luminescence characteristics is rarely reported. Herein, we report an organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite, [(BA)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;PbI4] (Compound 1, BA=n&#8208;butylamine) by introducing flexible organic cations (HBA+), with direct mid&#8208;band gap as 2.28&#8197;eV. Interestingly, this material exhibits two&#8208;step reversible dielectric response at 350&#8197;K and 460&#8197;K (in heating process), respectively. Besides, the photoluminescence was found: it emits charming green light under 365&#8197;nm lamp (Photoluminescence quantum yield is 9.52&#8201;%). The outstanding two&#8208;step dielectric response and luminescence characteristics of this compound might pave the way for the application of dielectric and ferroelectric functional materials in temperature sensors and mechanical switches.

         <title>Broad&#8208;Spectrum Antidote Discovery by Untangling the Reactivation Mechanism of Nerve&#8208;Agent&#8208;Inhibited Acetylcholinesterase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 40, July 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational design of efficient antidotes to organophosphorus nerve agent (OPNA) intoxication needs to account for the complexity of the molecular system. A fragment with broad&#8208;spectrum binding profile was transformed into a multi&#8208;active reactivator of OPNAs&#8208;inhibited acetylcholinesterases. Reactivation and pre&#8208;reactivation kinetics, supplemented with structural data show that efficient reactivation is linked to longer residence time, and reveal that the OPNAs dictate both the initial binding and the structural prerequisites for the reactivation reaction.







Abstract
Reactivators are vital for the treatment of organophosphorus nerve agent (OPNA) intoxication but new alternatives are needed due to their limited clinical applicability. The toxicity of OPNAs stems from covalent inhibition of the essential enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which reactivators relieve via a chemical reaction with the inactivated enzyme. Here, we present new strategies and tools for developing reactivators. We discover suitable inhibitor scaffolds by using an activity&#8208;independent competition assay to study non&#8208;covalent interactions with OPNA&#8208;AChEs and transform these inhibitors into broad&#8208;spectrum reactivators. Moreover, we identify determinants of reactivation efficiency by analysing reactivation and pre&#8208;reactivation kinetics together with structural data. Our results show that new OPNA reactivators can be discovered rationally by exploiting detailed knowledge of the reactivation mechanism of OPNA&#8208;inhibited AChE.

         <title>Binding of VIVO2+, VIVOL, VIVOL2 and VVO2L Moieties to Proteins: X&#8208;ray/Theoretical Characterization and Biological Implications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 40, July 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pharmacologically active VIVOL2 complexes (L=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine, 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, picolinato) undergo hydrolysis, exchange of ligands, and redox processes to form VIVOL2/VIVOL/VVO2L/VIVO2+&#8722;protein adducts with lysozyme and trypsin, with the binding of Asp, Asn, and Ser residues, that might contribute to their biological activity. X&#8208;ray diffraction and computational studies suggest the critical role of hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds and microsolvation in the stabilization of these structures.







Abstract
Vanadium compounds have frequently been proposed as therapeutics, but their application has been hampered by the lack of information on the different V&#8208;containing species that may form and how these interact with blood and cell proteins, and with enzymes. Herein, we report several resolved crystal structures of lysozyme with bound VIVO2+ and VIVOL2+, where L=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine or 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen), and of trypsin with VIVO(picolinato)2 and VVO2(phen)+ moieties. Computational studies complete the refinement and shed light on the relevant role of hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and microsolvation in stabilizating the structure. Noteworthy is that the trypsin&#8722;VVO2(phen) and trypsin&#8722;VIVO(OH)(phen) adducts correspond to similar energies, thus suggesting a possible interconversion under physiological/biological conditions. The obtained data support the relevance of hydrolysis of VIV and VV complexes in the several types of binding established with proteins and the formation of different adducts that might contribute to their pharmacological action, and significantly widen our knowledge of vanadium&#8211;protein interactions.

         <title>Hierarchically Porous Poly(ionic liquid) &#8211; Organic Cage Composite Membrane for Efficient Iodine Capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 40, July 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchically micro&#8208;meso&#8208;macroporous poly(ionic liquid)&#8208;organic cage composite membrane with a gradient content distribution of organic cage crystals throughout the membrane was prepared. The composite membrane allows for rapid diffusion of iodine vapor, leading to an outstanding iodine uptake capacity. Furthermore, such porous membrane can be processed into membrane modules for trace iodine vapor capture and interception, revealing its great potential for practical application.







Abstract
The effective capture of iodine with high volatility and poisonousness is significant for reprocessing the spent nuclear fuel. In this article, we report a hierarchically porous poly(ionic liquid)&#8208;organic cage composite membrane (PIL@CC3) possessing a gradient content distribution of CC3 cage crystals throughout the membrane to capture iodine vapor. The introduction of microporous CC3 can significantly enhance the uptake capacity of iodine up to 980&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is superior to that of a pristine PIL membrane carrying large meso&#8208; and macropores (99&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1), and CC3 crystalline powder (662&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1). Such enhanced performance benefits from the micro&#8208;meso&#8208;macroporous structure of the PIL@CC3 membrane in which the large meso&#8208; and macropores facilitate the mass transfer of iodine molecules from the external environment into the surface of the CC3 crystal, followed by diffusion of iodine molecules from the CC3 surface into the interior and exterior pores of the CC3 crystal. In addition, the asymmetric distribution of CC3 crystals across the PIL@CC3 membrane also displays its advantage in intercepting trace iodine, revealing its great potential for practical application. This study provides an idea for constructing hierarchically porous membrane composites for the removal of toxic vapors.

         <title>Triplet&#8208;triplet Annihilation Dynamics of Naphthalene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 40, July 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) of naphthalene has been investigated by using multi&#8208;reference methods along with quantum dynamics simulations. The study involves obtaining the mechanistic details of the process and understand the time evolution of nuclear wavepacket on the computed potential energy surfaces. The results suggest that the TTA is mediated by conical intersections (CIs). It is also demonstrated that the strong light&#8208;matter interaction increases the efficiency of TTA based photon upconversion.







Abstract
Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) is a spin&#8208;allowed conversion of two triplet states into one singlet excited state, which provides an efficient route to generate a photon of higher frequency than the incident light. Multiple energy transfer steps between absorbing (sensitizer) and emitting (annihilator) molecular species are involved in the TTA based photon upconversion process. TTA compounds have recently been studied for solar energy applications, even though the maximum upconversion efficiency of 50&#8201;% is yet to be achieved. With the aid of quantum calculations and based on a few key requirements, several design principles have been established to develop the well&#8208;functioning annihilators. However, a complete molecular level understanding of triplet fusion dynamics is still missing. In this work, we have employed multi&#8208;reference electronic structure methods along with quantum dynamics to obtain a detailed and fundamental understanding of TTA mechanism in naphthalene. Our results suggest that the TTA process in naphthalene is mediated by conical intersections. In addition, we have explored the triplet fusion dynamics under the influence of strong light&#8208;matter coupling and found an increase of the TTA based upconversion efficiency.

         <title>Measurements and Utilization of Consistent Gibbs Energies of Transfer of Single Ions: Towards a Unified Redox Potential Scale for All Solvents</title>

         <dc:description>
Consistency: 87 measurements across 10 independent junctions between four solvents and using the &#8220;ideal&#8221; ionic liquid salt bridge ILSB have furnished accurate silver ion Gibbs transfer energies between water, acetonitrile, propylene carbonate and dimethylformamide that are consistent within 0.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. These form the basis for a coherent experimental thermodynamic framework of ion solvation chemistry.







Abstract
Utilizing the &#8220;ideal&#8221; ionic liquid salt bridge to measure Gibbs energies of transfer of silver ions between the solvents water, acetonitrile, propylene carbonate and dimethylformamide results in a consistent data set with a precision of 0.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 over 87 measurements in 10 half&#8208;cells. This forms the basis for a coherent experimental thermodynamic framework of ion solvation chemistry. In addition, we define the solvent independent 
&#8208; and the 
 values that account for the electronating potential of any redox system similar to the 
 value of a medium that accounts for its protonating potential. This 
 scale is thermodynamically well&#8208;defined enabling a straightforward comparison of the redox potentials (reducities) of all media with respect to the aqueous redox potential scale, hence unifying all conventional solvents&#8242; redox potential scales. Thus, using the Gibbs energy of transfer of the silver ion published herein, one can convert and unify all hitherto published redox potentials measured, for example, against ferrocene, to the 
 scale.

         <title>Adaptable Optical Microwaveguides From Mechanically Flexible Crystalline Materials</title>

Bent waveguides, especially, singly and doubly bent waveguides are essential for the advancement of photonic technologies. Here, two chemically and optically different flexible organic crystals were fabricated into singly and doubly&#8208;bent shapes from straight geometry using micromechanical manipulation technique to demonstrate optical waveguiding behavior which is required for photonic circuit applications. (Atomic force microscopy cantilever tip abbreviated as AFM cantilever)







Abstract
Flexible organic crystals (elastic and plastic) are important materials for optical waveguides, tunable optoelectronic devices, and photonic integrated circuits. Here, we present highly elastic organic crystals of a Schiff base, 1&#8208;((E)&#8208;(2,5&#8208;dichlorophenylimino)methyl)naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol (1), and an azine molecule, 2,4&#8208;dibromo&#8208;6&#8208;((E)&#8208;((E)&#8208;(2,6&#8208;dichlorobenzylidene)hydrazono)methyl)phenol (2). These microcrystals are highly flexible under external mechanical force, both in the macroscopic and the microscopic regimes. The mechanical flexibility of these crystals arises as a result of weak and dispersive C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl, Cl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl, Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br, and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions. Singly and doubly&#8208;bent geometries were achieved from their straight shape by a micromechanical approach using the AFM cantilever tip. Crystals of molecules 1 and 2 display a bright&#8208;green and red fluorescence (FL), respectively, and selective reabsorption of a part of their FL band. Crystals 1 and 2 exhibit optical&#8208;path&#8208;dependent low loss emissions at the termini of crystal in their straight and even in extremely bent geometries. Interestingly, the excitation position&#8208;dependent optical modes appear in both linear and bent waveguides of crystals 1 and 2, confirming their light&#8208;trapping ability.

Here, two chemically and optically different flexible organic crystals were fabricated into singly and doubly-bent shapes from straight geometry using micromechanical manipulation technique to demonstrate optical waveguiding behavior which is required for photonic circuit applications. (Atomic force microscopy cantilever tip abbreviated as AFM cantilever)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flexible organic crystals (elastic and plastic) are important materials for optical waveguides, tunable optoelectronic devices, and photonic integrated circuits. Here, we present highly elastic organic crystals of a Schiff base, 1-((E)-(2,5-dichlorophenylimino)methyl)naphthalen-2-ol (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), and an azine molecule, 2,4-dibromo-6-((E)-((E)-(2,6-dichlorobenzylidene)hydrazono)methyl)phenol (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;). These microcrystals are highly flexible under external mechanical force, both in the macroscopic and the microscopic regimes. The mechanical flexibility of these crystals arises as a result of weak and dispersive C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl, Cl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl, Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br, and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions. Singly and doubly-bent geometries were achieved from their straight shape by a micromechanical approach using the AFM cantilever tip. Crystals of molecules &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; display a bright-green and red fluorescence (FL), respectively, and selective reabsorption of a part of their FL band. Crystals &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; exhibit optical-path-dependent low loss emissions at the termini of crystal in their straight and even in extremely bent geometries. Interestingly, the excitation position-dependent optical modes appear in both linear and bent waveguides of crystals &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, confirming their light-trapping ability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Bridging Enables Isolated Iron Atoms on Stereoassembled Carbon Framework To Boost Oxygen Reduction for Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

Highly dispersed Fe atoms on a porous carbon nanofiber framework (Fe&#8722;SA/NCF) are realized by a facile and scalable matrix&#8208;confined co&#8208;pyrolysis strategy based on molecular bridging. Benefitting from highly accessible Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C sites and well&#8208;tuned pore structures, Fe&#8722;SA/NCF delivers boosted oxygen reduction activity and stability via a near four&#8208;electron path, which further demonstrates potential application in zinc&#8208;air batteries, surpassing the commercial Pt/C catalyst.







Abstract
Realizing the synergy between active site regulation and rational structural engineering is essential in the electrocatalysis community but still challenging. Here, a matrix&#8208;confined co&#8208;pyrolysis strategy based on molecular bridging is demonstrated to realize highly dispersed Fe atoms on stereoassembled carbon framework. Both polyacrylonitrile matrix and organic linker from metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide sufficient N&#8208;anchoring sites for the generation of Fe&#8722;N4 moieties. A high Fe loading of 2.9&#8197;wt.% is readily achieved based on the scalable approach without post&#8208;treatment. Owing to the presence of highly exposed Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C sites and well&#8208;tuned pore structures, isolated Fe atoms on porous carbon nanofiber framework (Fe&#8722;SA/NCF) exhibits decent oxygen reduction activity and stability in alkaline conditions via a near four&#8208;electron path, demonstrating superior performance as air cathode for zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) to commercial Pt/C catalyst.

         <title>Cesium&#8208;Fluoride&#8208;Promoted Synthesis of Stable Organocesium Reagents and Their Ambident Reactivities with Arynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 40, July 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different structurally unique thio&#8208;organocesium compounds have been synthesized through a mild, one&#8208;step reaction employing CsF as a cheap source of cesium. This article also highlights the importance of their ambident character to control the divergent synthesis of stable sulfonium ylides and c&#8208;arylation products. Furthermore, fine tuning of these substrates (lacking &#945;&#8208;CH protons) helped in the preparation of various ortho&#8208;bifunctional arenes. As an advantage, reactions in one pot helped to promote the reactions through insertion mechanism to ortho&#8208;functional arenes.







Abstract
Described are the diverse reactivities of novel, stable, ambident thio&#8208;organocesium reagents (bearing electron withdrawing groups) against benzynes. Reactions at reflux temperature predominantly led to the generation of various functionalized stable sulfonium ylides and at 40&#8201;&#176;C the same reaction underwent direct c&#8208;arylation. Furthermore, lack of internal hydrogen on the cesium reagent helped to produce different ortho&#8208;bifunctional arynes in both the reactions. Interestingly, depending on the reactivities of substrates, the one&#8208;pot tri&#8208;component procedure generated either ylides or &#963;&#8208;bond insertion products.

         <title>How Ionization Catalyzes Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 40, July 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Let's get radical! Quantum chemical activation strain analyses reveal how ionization of a dienophile can effectively catalyze the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction by reducing the Pauli repulsion and simultaneously enhancing the orbital interactions. This study nicely demonstrates the similarities and differences between radical&#8208;cation and Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed Diels&#8208;Alder reactions.







Abstract
The catalytic effect of ionization on the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between 1,3&#8208;butadiene and acrylaldehyde has been studied using relativistic density functional theory (DFT). Removal of an electron from the dienophile, acrylaldehyde, significantly accelerates the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction and shifts the reaction mechanism from concerted asynchronous for the neutral Diels&#8208;Alder reaction to stepwise for the radical&#8208;cation Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. Our detailed activation strain and Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital analyses reveal how ionization of the dienophile enhances the Diels&#8208;Alder reactivity via two mechanisms: (i) by amplifying the asymmetry in the dienophile's occupied &#960;&#8208;orbitals to such an extent that the reaction goes from concerted asynchronous to stepwise and thus with substantially less steric (Pauli) repulsion per reaction step; (ii) by enhancing the stabilizing orbital interactions that result from the ability of the singly occupied molecular orbital of the radical&#8208;cation dienophile to engage in an additional three&#8208;electron bonding interaction with the highest occupied molecular orbital of the diene.

         <title>Hydrogenative Catalysis with Three&#8208;Coordinate Zinc Complexes Supported with PN Ligands is Enhanced Compared to PNP Analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 40, July 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic activity of bidentate three&#8208;coordinate Zn(II) complexes towards hydrogenation of model ketone and imine substrates is enhanced compared to the analogous tridentate PNP system. DFT calculations and experimental evidence point towards a sigma bond metathesis mechanism, instead of aromatization/dearomatization metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity, with the lack of trailing P&#8208;arm enabling the enhancement.







Abstract
This work details the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic activity of reactive low&#8208;coordinate organozinc complexes. The complexes activate hydrogen and they appear to be more active in hydrogenation of ketones and imines than their tridentate pincer analogs. This is thought, in part, to be due to the lack of trailing third phosphorus arm present in previous work. DFT computations reveal a sigma&#8208;bond metathesis mechanism is comparable to an alternative aromatization/dearomatization metal&#8208;ligand cooperative mechanism.

         <title>Teaching an Old Compound New Tricks: Reversible Transamidation in Maleamic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 40, July 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible transamidation is described for different maleamic acids. Amide formation and exchange proceed to equilibrium at room temperature without external catalysts, and the equilibrium composition can be controlled using different stimuli. Thermodynamic and kinetic compositions can be accessed by amide libraries produced in this way. This new dynamic bond can be useful in dynamic combinatorial chemistry.







Abstract
Dynamic combinatorial chemistry is a method widely used for generating responsive libraries of compounds, with applications ranging from chemical biology to materials science. It relies on dynamic covalent bonds that are able to form in a reversible manner in mild conditions, and therefore requires the discovery of new types of these bonds in order to progress. Amides, due to their high stability, have been scarcely used in this field and typically require an external catalyst or harsh conditions for exchange.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reversible transamidation&lt;/b&gt; is described for different maleamic acids. Amide formation and exchange proceed to equilibrium at room temperature without external catalysts, and the equilibrium composition can be controlled using different stimuli. Thermodynamic and kinetic compositions can be accessed by amide libraries produced in this way. This new dynamic bond can be useful in dynamic combinatorial chemistry.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamic combinatorial chemistry is a method widely used for generating responsive libraries of compounds, with applications ranging from chemical biology to materials science. It relies on dynamic covalent bonds that are able to form in a reversible manner in mild conditions, and therefore requires the discovery of new types of these bonds in order to progress. Amides, due to their high stability, have been scarcely used in this field and typically require an external catalyst or harsh conditions for exchange. Compounds able to undergo uncatalysed transamidation at room temperature are still rare exceptions. In this work, we describe reversible amide formation and transamidation in a class of compounds known as maleamic acids. Due to the presence of a carboxylic acid in &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-position, these compounds are in equilibrium with their anhydride and amine precursors in organic solvents at room temperature. First, we show that this equilibrium is responsive to external stimuli: by alternating the additions of a Br&#248;nsted acid and a base, we can switch between amide and anhydride several times without side-reactions. Next, we prove that this equilibrium provides a pathway for reversible transamidation without any added catalyst, leading to thermodynamic distributions of amides at room temperature. Lastly, we use different preparation conditions and concentrations of Br&#248;nsted acid to access different library distributions, easily controlling the transition between kinetic and thermodynamic regimes. Our results show that maleamic acids can undergo transamidation in mild conditions in a reversible and tunable way, establishing them as a new addition to the toolbox of dynamic combinatorial chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Frontispiece: Isopropenyl Esters (iPEs) in Green Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 40, July 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isopropenyl esters (iPEs) and isopropenyl acetate (iPAc) are characterised by a tuneable reactivity in organic synthesis. Thanks to the irreversible formation of acetone in transesterification conditions, iPEs are eco&#8208;friendly acylating agents and can be employed for direct biomass modification and/or tandem esterification&#8208;acetalization reactions. C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X bond formation reactions occur selectively on the isopropenyl moiety via electrophilic and/or radical additions and/or metal&#8208; and/or photo&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

Ionization of the dienophile is an effective method to enhance the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene and acrylaldehyde. The origin of this ionization catalysis is both a reduction in steric Pauli repulsion and simultaneous enhancement of the orbital interactions between the reactants. Our work demonstrates the similarities and differences between radical&#8211;cation and Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. More information can be found in the Research Article by T.&#8197;A. Hamlin, F.&#8197;M. Bickelhaupt, and P. Vermeeren (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200987).

         <dc:description>
Triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA)&#8208;based photon upconversion involves the fusion of two non&#8208;emissive triplet excited states into one singlet excited state. The TTA process in naphthalene is found to be mediated by conical intersection between the T1T1 and S1S0 states. The coupling of an optical cavity to a naphthalene dimer results in an increase in the efficiency of TTA&#8208;assisted photon upconversion process. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Gudem and M. Kowalewski (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200781).

         <title>Isopropenyl Esters (iPEs) in Green Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 40, July 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustainability: This comprehensive review showcases the unique reactivity features of bifunctional isopropenyl esters (iPEs), such as sopropenyl acetate (iPAc), bearing an ester moiety, suitable for irreversible transesterification reactions, while the isopropenyl unsaturation reacts selectively in electrophilic and/or radical additions, as well as in metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Moreover, iPEs can be successfully employed for direct biomass modification (i.&#8201;e., lignin or cellulose) and in tandem esterification&#8208;acetalization reactions.







Abstract
The need for greener compounds able to replace conventional ones with similar reactivity is crucial for the development of sustainable chemistry. Isopropenyl esters (iPEs) represent one eco&#8208;friendly alternative to acyl halides and anhydrides. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the preparation methodologies and reported synthetic applications of iPEs and, in particular, of isopropenyl acetate (iPAc). Intriguingly, the presence of a C=C double bond adjacent to the ester functionality makes iPEs appealing in different chemoselective organic synthesis transformations. For instance, the acyl moiety is suitable for transesterification reactions in presence of different heteroatom&#8208;based nucleophiles (C&#8722;, O&#8722;, N&#8722;, S&#8722;, Se&#8722;); these reactions are irreversible thanks to the formation of acetone, obtained upon keto&#8208;enol tautomerization of the prop&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;ol (isopropenyl) leaving group. Similarly, the unsaturation contained in the isopropenyl synthon could be selectively exploited in organic synthesis for electrophilic and/or radical additions as well as in metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. To conclude, iPEs recently found major interest in the direct modification of biomass (i.e. lignin or cellulose) and in the implementation of tandem reactions of esterification&#8208;acetalization by exploiting the co&#8208;formation of acetone during the reaction.

&#8220;This ionization methodology has been extensively exploited in the laboratory to accelerate Diels&#8211;Alder reactions, but no theoretical foundation was available for understanding the physical origin of this catalytic effect.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202200987).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are Pascal&#8197;Vermeeren, Trevor&#8197;A. Hamlin, and F.&#8197;Matthias Bickelhaupt of the TheoCheM group at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. The cover art depicts how ionizing the dienophile lowers the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction barrier between 1,3&#8208;butadiene and acrylaldehyde by reducing the destabilizing steric Pauli repulsion and enhancing the stabilizing orbital interactions.

         <title>Selective Oxidations Using a Cytochrome P450 Enzyme Variant Driven with Surrogate Oxygen Donors and Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single amino acid mutation can convert cytochrome P450 monooxygenases into peroxygenase. These do not require the addition of nicotinamide cofactors or electron transfer proteins greatly simplifying their application. For example, urea&#8208;hydrogen peroxide and light can be used to drive the selective oxidations catalysed by these enzymes.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase enzymes are versatile catalysts, which have been adapted for multiple applications in chemical synthesis. Mutation of a highly conserved active site threonine to a glutamate can convert these enzymes into peroxygenases that utilise hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Here, we use the T252E&#8208;CYP199A4 variant to study peroxide&#8208;driven oxidation activity by using H2O2 and urea&#8208;hydrogen peroxide (UHP). We demonstrate that the T252E variant has a higher stability to H2O2 in the presence of substrate that can undergo carbon&#8208;hydrogen abstraction. This peroxygenase variant could efficiently catalyse O&#8208;demethylation and an enantioselective epoxidation reaction (94&#8201;% ee). Neither the monooxygenase nor peroxygenase pathways of the P450 demonstrated a significant kinetic isotope effect (KIE) for the oxidation of deuterated substrates. These new peroxygenase variants offer the possibility of simpler cytochrome P450 systems for selective oxidations. To demonstrate this, a light driven H2O2 generating system was used to support efficient product formation with this peroxygenase enzyme.

         <title>Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Water&#8208;Soluble Esterase&#8208;Activated CO&#8208;Releasing Molecules Targeting Mitochondria</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic moiety makes the difference. A pyridinium salt in the ester side chain not only improves the water solubility of acyloxydiene&#8208;Fe(CO)3 complexes but also directs these prodrugs to mitochondria, where they are triggered by an esterase to release carbon monoxide as an anti&#8208;inflammatory and cytoprotective agent directly effecting the metabolic state of the cells.







Abstract
Due to the beneficial effects of carbon monoxide as a cell&#8208;protective and anti&#8208;inflammatory agent, CO&#8208;releasing molecules (CORMs) offer some promising potential applications in medicine. In this context, we synthesized a set of acyloxy&#8208;cyclohexadiene&#8208;Fe(CO)3 complexes, all displaying a N&#8208;methyl&#8208;pyridinium triflate moiety in the ester side chain, as mitochondria&#8208;targeting esterase&#8208;triggered CORM prodrugs. Whereas the compounds in which the acyloxy substituent is attached to the 2&#8208;position of the diene&#8208;Fe(CO)3 unit (A series) spontaneously release CO upon dissolution in phosphate buffer, which remarkably is partly suppressed in the presence of porcine liver esterase (PLE), the 1&#8208;substituted isomers (B series) show the expected PLE&#8208;induced release of CO (up to 3&#8197;equiv.). The biological activity of Mito&#8208;CORMs 2/3&#8208;B and their isophorone&#8208;derived analogs 2/3&#8208;A&#8217;, which also displayed PLE&#8208;induced CO release, was assessed by using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Whereas Mito&#8208;CORMs 2/3&#8208;B were not cytotoxic up to 500&#8197;&#956;M (MTT assay), Mito&#8208;CORMs 2/3&#8208;A&#8217; caused significant toxicity at concentrations above 50&#8197;&#956;M. The anti&#8208;inflammatory potential of both Mito&#8208;CORM variants was demonstrated by concentration&#8208;dependent down&#8208;regulation of the pro&#8208;inflammatory markers VCAM&#8208;1, ICAM&#8208;1 and CXCL1 as well as induction of HO&#8208;1 in TNF&#945;&#8208;stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs; western blotting and qPCR). Energy phenotyping by seahorse real&#8208;time cell metabolic analysis, revealed opposing shifts of metabolic potentials in cells treated either with Mito&#8208;CORMs 2/3&#8208;B (increased mitochondrial respiration and glycolytic activity) or Mito&#8208;CORMs 2/3&#8208;A&#8217; (suppressed mitochondrial respiration and increased glycolytic activity). Thus, the Mito&#8208;CORMs represent valuable tools for the safe and targeted delivery of CO to mitochondria as a subcellular compartment to induce positive anti&#8208;inflammatory effects with only minor shifts in cellular energy metabolism. Also, due to their water solubility, these compounds provide a promising starting point for further pharmacological studies.

         <title>Photothermal Oxidation of Cinnamyl Alcohol with Hydrogen Peroxide Catalyzed by Gold Nanoparticle/Antimony&#8208;Doped Tin Oxide Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold nanoparticle&#8208;loaded, antimony&#8208;doped tin oxide nanocrystals (Au/ATO NCs) show thermally activated catalytic activity for the oxidation of cinnamyl alcohol to cinnamaldehyde by hydrogen peroxide. Light irradiation (&#955;ex&gt;660&#8197;nm, &#8764;0.5 sun) of Au/ATO NCs gives rise to a more than twofold increase in the rate of reaction with &#8764;95&#8201;% selectivity. Kinetic analyses indicated that the striking enhancement of the reaction stems from the rise in the temperature near the catalyst surface of &#8764;30&#8197;K due to the photothermal effect of the ATO NCs. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Tada and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201653).

         <title>An Iodide&#8208;mediated Anodic Amide Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ubiquity of amide bonds, present in natural products and common pharmaceuticals renders this functional group one of the most prevalent in organic chemistry. Despite its importance and a wide variety of existing methods for its formation, the latter still can be a challenge for classical activating reagents such as chloridating agents or carbodiimides. As the spent reagents often cannot be recycled, the development of more sustainable methods is highly desirable. Herein, we report an operationally simple and mild indirect electrochemical protocol to effect the condensation of carboxylic acids with amines, forming a wide variety of carboxamides.</dc:description>

         <title>One Fluorophore&#8208;Two Sensing Films: Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Directed Formation of a Quadruple Perylene Bisimide Stack</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elaborately designed &#960;&#8208;stacked molecular aggregates are significant for modulation of photophysical properties of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Herein, a double hydrogen&#8208;bonds trussed di(pyridyl)pyrrole&#8208;perylene bisimide (HDPP&#8208;PBI) was designed and its dimerization behavior was studied. HDPP&#8208;PBI tends to form a quadruple PBI stack with a dimerization constant of ~5.56 &#215; 10  6  M  &#8208;1  . The dimerization was ascribed to synergistic intramolecular double hydrogen&#8208;bonds formation and intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. Addition of CF  3  COOH, a hydrogen bond blocker, promotes the dimer to monomer transition. Accordingly, two distinct fluorescent films were prepared by drop&#8208;casting of the dimerized or the monomeric HDPP&#8208;PBI onto a substrate surface. Interestingly, the less&#8208;emissive PBI quadruple stack&#8208;based film showed a turn on response to acetone vapor, while the highly emissive HDPP&#8208;PBI&#8208;based film exhibited fluorescence quenching upon exposure to triethylamine vapor. We believe that the discovered synergistic effect in the PBI aggregates would enlighten the design of new PAHs aggregates with defined structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic and Kinetic Investigations of ON/OFF (Photo)Switchable Binding of Carbon Monoxide by Chromium(0), Molybdenum(0) and Tungsten(0) Carbonyl Complexes with a Pyridyl&#8208;Mesoionic Carbene Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shining light on group 6&#8201;photochemistry: The reversible (photo)chemistry of chromium(0), molybdenum(0) and tungsten(0) carbonyl complexes containing a mesoionic carbene ligand has been investigated. Kinetic and mechanistic studies were performed by using (temperature&#8208;dependent) FTIR and UV/VIS spectroscopy, in combination with density functional theory calculations.







Abstract
This work tackles the photochemistry of a series of mononuclear Cr0, Mo0 and W0 carbonyl complexes containing a bidentate mesoionic carbene ligand of the 1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene type. FTIR spectroscopy, combined with density functional theory calculations, revealed a clean photo&#8208;induced reaction in organic solvents (acetonitrile, pyridine, valeronitrile) to give mainly one photoproduct with monosubstitution of a carbonyl ligand for a solvent molecule. The highest photodissociation quantum yields were reached for the Cr0 complex under UV irradiation (266&#8197;nm). Based on previous investigations, the kinetics of the dark reverse reactions have now been determined, with reaction times of up to several hours in pyridine. Photochemical studies in the solid state (KBr matrix, frozen solution) also showed light&#8208;induced reactivity with stabilization of the metastable intermediate with a free coordination site at very low temperature. The identified reactive species emphasizes a mechanism without ligand&#8211;sphere reorganization.

         <title>Noncovalent Interactions Involving Group 6&#8201;in Biological Systems: The Case of Molybdopterin and Tungstopterin Cofactors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Protein Data Bank inspection revealed the existence of noncovalent contacts between tetra&#8208; and pentacoordinated Mo/W complexes and electron donor atoms. This newly attractive force involving elements from group&#8197;6 has been described as a Wolfium bond, being markedly different from classical coordination bonds (antibonding Wf&#8208;Ligand orbital involved). The results derived from the PDB survey have been backed up by an ab initio computational study at the RI&#8208;MP2/def2&#8208;TZVP level of theory.







Abstract
In this study we propose to coin the term Wolfium bond (WfB) to refer to a net attractive force (noncovalent interaction) between any element of group&#8197;6 and electron donor atoms (neutral molecules or anions) and to differentiate it from a coordination bond (metal&#8208;ligand interaction). We provide evidence of the existence of this interaction by inspecting the X&#8208;ray crystal structure of proteins containing Molybdopterin and Tungstopterin cofactors from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The plausible biological role of the interaction as well as its physical nature (antibonding Wf&#8208;Ligand orbital involved) are also analyzed by means of ab initio calculations (RI&#8208;MP2/def2&#8208;TZVP level of theory), Atoms in Molecules (AIM), Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) and Noncovalent Interactions plot (NCIplot) analyses.

         <title>Bistriazoles Connected Through a B&#8722;B Bridge, Synthesized by Highly Selective Dipolar Cycloaddition Reactions of a Diazido&#8208;diborane(4)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An exceptionally thermally stable diazido diborane was applied in dipolar cycloaddition reactions with terminal alkynes. The products are the first bistriazoles connected by a B&#8722;B bond. The reactions are highly regioselective, leading exclusively to the 1,4&#8208;triazoles, and tolerate the presence of Lewis&#8208;basic groups and additional alkynyl groups at the alkyne.







Abstract
In this work we report the first cycloaddition reactions between a diazido diborane(4) and terminal alkynes, providing unique access to bis&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles connected by a B&#8722;B bridge. The catalyst&#8208;free reactions are highly selective, yielding exclusively the thermodynamically disfavored bis&#8208;1,4&#8208;triazoles. The reactions are enabled by the high thermal stability of the diazido&#8208;diborane [B(hpp)(N3)]2 (hpp=1,3,4,6,7,8&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrimido[1,2&#8208;&#945;]pyrimidinate). Due to the tetra&#8208;coordinate boron atoms in this reagent, the reactions are tolerant with respect to the introduction of Lewis&#8208;basic groups at the alkyne. The scope and limitations of the new reactions are discussed.

         <title>Modulation of the Naked&#8208;Eye and Fluorescence Color of a Protonated Boron&#8208;Doped Thiazolothiazole by Anion&#8208;Dependent Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The visible and fluorescence colors of a doubly protonated boron&#8208;doped thiazolothiazole can be modulated by tuning its hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions with its counteranions or donor solvent molecules (Cl&#8722;, O3SCF3&#8722;, B(3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3)4&#8722;, OEt2). DFT calculations show that these affect the relative energies of the &#960; orbitals involved in the S0&#8594;S1 transition, thus enabling fine&#8208;tuning of their absorption and emission spectral features.







Abstract
The reaction of a cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized thiazaborolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazaborole (TzbTzb) with strong Br&#248;nsted acids, such as HCl, HOTf (Tf=O2SCF3) and [H(OEt2)2][BArF4] (ArF=3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3), results in the protonation of both TzbTzb nitrogen atoms. In each case X&#8208;ray crystallographic data show coordination of the counteranions (Cl&#8722;, OTf&#8722;, BArF4&#8722;) or solvent molecules (OEt2) to the doubly protonated fused heterocycle via hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, the strength of which strongly influences the 1H&#8197;NMR shift of the NH protons, enabling tuning of both the visible (yellow to red) and fluorescence (green to red) colors of these salts. DFT calculations reveal that the hydrogen bonding of the counteranion or solvent to the protonated nitrogen centers affects the intramolecular TzbTzb&#8208;to&#8208;CAAC charge transfer character involved in the S0&#8594;S1 transition, ultimately enabling fine&#8208;tuning of their absorption and emission spectral features.

         <title>Key Role of a&#8208;Top CO on Terrace Sites of Metallic Pd Clusters for CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
O2 titration using in&#8197;situ DRIFTS was performed on metallic Pd cluster supported on Al2O3 saturated with CO. The most weakly adsorbed a&#8208;top CO adsorbed on terrace site preferentially reacted with oxygen than other CO species. It clearly demonstrated that the CO oxidation is initiated with a&#8208;top CO on terrace sites.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;based catalysts are the most widely used for CO oxidation because of their outstanding catalytic activity and thermal stability. However, fundamental understanding of the detailed catalytic processes occurring on Pd&#8208;based catalysts under realistic conditions is still lacking. In this study, we investigated CO oxidation on metallic Pd clusters supported on Al2O3 and SiO2. High&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed the formation of similar&#8208;sized Pd clusters on Al2O3 and SiO2. In contrast, CO chemisorption analysis indicated a gradual change in the dispersion of Pd (from 0.79 to 0.2) on Pd/Al2O3 and a marginal change in the dispersion (from 0.4 to 0.24) on Pd/SiO2 as the Pd loading increased from 0.27 to 5.5&#8197;wt&#8201;%; these changes were attributed to differences in the metal&#8208;support interactions. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier&#8208;transform spectroscopy revealed that fewer a&#8208;top CO species were present in Pd supported on Al2O3 than those in Pd supported on SiO2, which is related to the morphological differences in the metallic Pd clusters on these two supports. Despite the different dispersion profiles and surface characteristics of Pd, O2 titration demonstrated that linearly bound CO (with an infrared signal at 2090&#8197;cm&#8722;1) reacted first with oxygen in the case of CO&#8208;saturated Pd on Al2O3 and SiO2, which suggests that a&#8208;top CO on the terrace site plays an important role in CO oxidation. The experimental observations were corroborated by periodic density functional calculations, which confirmed that CO oxidation on the (111) terrace sites is most plausible, both kinetically and thermodynamically, compared to that on the edge or corner sites. This study will deepen the fundamental understanding of the effect of Pd clusters on CO oxidation under reaction conditions.

         <title>Dissecting Noncovalent Interactions in Carboxyl&#8208;Functionalized Ionic Liquids Exhibiting Double and Single Hydrogens Bonds Between Ions of Like Charge</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Like&#8208;likes&#8208;like charge attraction is observed for a carboxyl&#8208;functionalized ionic liquid that exhibits three kind of hydrogen bond: the expected single hydrogen bonds between cation and anion, and, surprisingly, single and double hydrogen bonds between the cations, despite the repulsive Coulomb forces between the ions of like charge. Combining X&#8208;ray crystallography, differential scanning calorimetry, IR spectroscopy, thermodynamic methods and DFT calculations allowed all kind of hydrogen bonds present in the solid, liquid and gaseous states to be addressed.







Abstract
We show that the carboxyl&#8208;functionalized ionic liquid 1&#8208;(carboxymethyl)pyridinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [HOOC&#8208;CH2&#8208;py][NTf2] exhibits three types of hydrogen bonding: the expected single hydrogen bonds between cation and anion, and, surprisingly, single and double hydrogen bonds between the cations, despite the repulsive Coulomb forces between the ions of like charge. Combining X&#8208;ray crystallography, differential scanning calorimetry, IR spectroscopy, thermodynamic methods and DFT calculations allows the analysis and characterization of all types of hydrogen bonding present in the solid, liquid and gaseous states of the ionic liquid (IL). We find doubly hydrogen bonded cationic dimers (c+=c+) in the crystalline phase. With increasing temperature, this binding motif opens in the liquid and is replaced by (c+&#8722;c+&#8722;a&#8722; species, with a remaining single cationic hydrogen bond and an additional hydrogen bond between cation and anion. We provide clear evidence that the IL evaporates as hydrogen&#8208;bonded ion pairs (c+&#8722;a&#8722;) into the gas phase. The measured transition enthalpies allow the noncovalent interactions to be dissected and the hydrogen bond strength between ions of like charge to be determined.

         <title>Geometrically Mismatched Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Framework Composed of Tetratopic Carboxylic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Geometrically mismatched assembly of CP&#8208;Phen provides a ladder&#8208;shaped hydrogen&#8208;bonded framework with carboxy groups free from the framework formation.







Abstract
Porous organic frameworks possessing interactive free sites in the pore have attracted much attention due to their potential to show the site&#8208;originated specific functionalities. Herein, we demonstrate that such a framework could be constructed using a concept of geometrically mismatched frameworks composed of phenanthroline&#8208;based tetratopic carboxylic acid CP&#8208;Phen. Simple recrystallization of CP&#8208;Phen yielded a solvent included porous framework CP&#8208;Phen&#8208;1, in which three of four carboxy groups form hydrogen&#8208;bonded dimer to form a ladder&#8208;shaped framework, while the remained one does not participate in framework formation due to geometrical mismatch and interacts with solvent molecules through weak hydrogen&#8208;bonding. This result implies that our proposed strategy is effective to provide free interactive sites in porous frameworks. Although CP&#8208;Phen&#8208;1 undergoes two&#8208;step structural transformation presumably accompanied by hydrogen&#8208;bond rearrangements upon loss of solvent molecules, the activate framework shows good thermal stability up to 360&#8201;&#176;C and selective CO2 adsorption.

         <title>Advances towards Cell&#8208;Specific Gene Transfection: A Small&#8208;Molecule Approach Allows Order&#8208;of&#8208;Magnitude Selectivity</title>

A biotin&#8208;labelled transfection vector tightly grabs a DNA molecule with a binding unit of similar size to the label. At the same time, a cancer cell scans the label with its biotin receptor.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A biotin-labelled transfection vector&lt;/b&gt; tightly grabs a DNA molecule with a binding unit of similar size to the label. At the same time, a cancer cell scans the label with its biotin receptor. While this will prompt the greedy cancer cell to be transfected by the DNA vector system, other cells are safe.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Synthesis of Core&#8208;Functionalised Naphthalene Diimides by Using a Vibratory Ball Mill: Suzuki, Sonogashira and Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvent&#8208;free synthesis of core&#8208;functionalised naphthalene diimide (c&#8208;NDI) residues in a vibratory ball mill is reported. Twenty&#8208;one naphthalene diimide&#8208;based products were produced by using Suzuki, Sonogashira and Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig palladium coupling reactions, including dimeric diimide products that are constituents in functioning organic photovoltaic solar cells. These reactions are rapid (60 to 90&#8197;minutes), do not require additional heating, and are tolerant of air and atmospheric moisture.







Abstract
Solvent&#8208;free synthesis by using a vibratory ball mill (VBM) offers the chance to access new chemical reactivity, whilst reducing solvent waste and minimising reaction times. Herein, we report the core functionalisation of N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)&#8208;2,6&#8208;dibromo&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenetetracarboxylic acid (Br2&#8208;NDI) by using Suzuki, Sonogashira and Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig coupling reactions. The products of these reactions are important building blocks in many areas of organic electronics including organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) and organic photovoltaic cells (OPVCs). The reactions proceed in as little as 1&#8197;h, use commercially available palladium sources (frequently Pd(OAc)2) and are tolerant to air and atmospheric moisture. Furthermore, the real&#8208;world potential of this green VBM protocol is demonstrated by the double Suzuki coupling of a monobromo(NDI) residue to a bis(thiophene) pinacol ester. The resulting dimeric NDI species has been demonstrated to behave as an electron acceptor in functioning OPVCs.

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Enabled Electric&#8208;Field Regulation and Ionic Redistribution Around Lithiophilic Aurum Nanoparticles Toward a Dendrite&#8208;Free and 2000&#8208;Cycle&#8208;Life Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene is conformally coated on the skeleton of Au@3D&#8722;Cu to form G&#8722;Au@3D&#8722;Cu, in which the conductive graphene layer not only decreases the local current intensity but also regulates the homogeneous redistribution of Li+ ions around lithiophilic Au nanoparticles. Benefiting from these merits, a dendrite&#8208;free and 2000&#8208;cycle&#8208;life LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2||G&#8722;Au@3D&#8722;Cu/Li full cell is proposed.







Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) have attracted extensive attention owing to their high energy density. However, the uncontrolled volume changes and serious dendrite growth of the Li metal anode have hindered their commercialization. Herein, a three&#8208;dimensional Cu foam decorated with Au nanoparticles and conformal graphene layer was designed to tune the Li plating/stripping behaviors. The 3D&#8722;Cu conductive host anchored by lithiophilic Au nanoparticles can effectively alleviate the volume expansion caused by the continuous plating/stripping of Li and reduce the nucleation energy barrier. Notably, the conductive graphene not only facilitates the transfer of electrons, but also acts as an ionic rectifier, thereby avoiding the aggregation of local current density and Li+ ions around Au nanoparticles and enabling the uniform Li+ flux. As a result, the G&#8722;Au@3D&#8722;Cu/Li anode ensures the non&#8208;dendritic and homogeneous Li+ plating/stripping. Electrochemical results show that the symmetric G&#8722;Au@3D&#8722;Cu/Li cell delivers a low voltage hysteresis of 110&#8197;mV after 1000&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Matched with a layered LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cathode, the NCM622||G&#8722;Au@3D&#8722;Cu/Li full cell exhibits a long cycle life of 2000 cycles and an ultra&#8208;low capacity decay rate (0.01&#8201;% per cycle).

The synthesis of new morphinan opioids by the addition of photochemically generated carbon&#8208;centered radicals to substrates containing an enone in the morphinan C&#8208;ring, is described. Using tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (TBADT) as a hydrogen atom transfer photocatalyst, diverse radical donors can be used to prepare a variety of C8&#8208;functionalized morphinan opioids. This work demonstrates the late&#8208;stage modification of complex, highly functionalized substrates.

         <title>A General Electro&#8208;Synthesis Approach to Amaryllidaceae Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly pharmaceutically relevant Amaryllidaceae alkaloids have been accessed by a versatile electro&#8208;organic key transformation, including a precursor of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor galantamine, used as FDA&#8208;approved drug for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Spirodienone&#8208;type intermediates were obtained in a regioselective and sustainable anodic key transformation from nature&#8208;derived starting materials







Abstract
Amaryllidaceae alkaloids appeal to organic chemists with their attractive structures and their impressive antitumor and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory properties. We demonstrate a highly versatile access to this family of natural products. A general protocol with high yields in a sustainable electro&#8208;organic key transformation on a metal&#8208;free anode to spirodienones facilitates functionalization to the alkaloids. The biomimetic syntheses start with the readily available, inexpensive biogenic starting materials methyl gallate, O&#8208;methyl tyramine, and vanillin derivatives. Through known dynamic resolutions, this technology provides access to both enantiomeric series of (epi&#8208;)martidine, (epi&#8208;)crinine, siculine, and galantamine, clinically prescribed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Characterization of a Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Sensitive Molecular Switch and Its PEGylation Towards a Self&#8208;Assembling Molecule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploiting the conjugation of the 3&#8208;phenyl benzofulvene scaffold, we prepared a new HBDI&#8208;like chromophore capable of absorbing blue light and photoisomerizing in the picosecond timescale. The PEGylation of this photoswitch lead to a visible light&#8208;sensitive amphiphilic molecule capable of self&#8208;assembly in water to give a spherical nanoaggregated structure.







Abstract
HBDI&#8208;like chromophores represent a novel set of biomimetic switches mimicking the fluorophore of the green fluorescent protein that are currently studied with the hope to expand the molecular switch/motor toolbox. However, until now members capable of absorbing visible light in their neutral (i.&#8201;e. non&#8208;anionic) form have not been reported. In this contribution we report the preparation of an HBDI&#8208;like chromophore based on a 3&#8208;phenylbenzofulvene scaffold capable of absorbing blue light and photoisomerizing on the picosecond timescale. More specifically, we show that double&#8208;bond photoisomerization occurs in both the E&#8208;to&#8208;Z and Z&#8208;to&#8208;E directions and that these can be controlled by irradiating with blue and UV light, respectively. Finally, as a preliminary applicative result, we report the incorporation of the chromophore in an amphiphilic molecule and demonstrate the formation of a visible&#8208;light&#8208;sensitive nanoaggregated state in water.

         <title>Determining the Reaction Mechanisms of Photo&#8208;Thermo Synergetic Processes by Kinetic Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coupled photo and thermal energies can help to improve the reaction activity of a certain reaction process. And kinetic studies are the key means (or way) to clarify light&#8208;specific contributions and even reaction mechanism in the photo&#8208;thermo catalysis, which would help to pave the way in &#8220;rational catalyst design&#8221;.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;thermo catalysis utilizing light has been a promising strategy to improve the conventional thermal catalytic activity and attracts great attention nowadays. However, how heat works in synergy with light radiation is still unclear. This Concept article is trying to clarify the specific contents via summarizing the kinetic studies including 1) proposing elementary steps through pressure dependence studies, 2) estimating reaction barriers through measuring the apparent activation energies and 3) assigning the kinetically relevant step(s) with kinetic isotope effects (KIE) as well as 4) exploring the relationship of the reaction rate with the light excitation wavelength and light intensity. The challenges in kinetic studies such as describing the light&#8208;induced carrier transfer process, the surface temperature under light illumination as well as reaction intermediates were discussed at the same time. Finally, an outlook about kinetic studies in clarifying the photo&#8208;thermo catalysis reaction mechanism was proposed.

Abstract
Adjusting the RedOx activity of polyoxometalate catalysts is a key challenge for the catalysis of selective oxidation reactions. For this purpose, the possibility of influencing the RedOx potential by the introduction of an additional RedOx&#8208;active element was investigated. Thereby, Keggin&#8208;type polyoxometalates (POMs) with up to three different elements in the metal framework were created. An advanced and reproducible synthetic procedure to incorporate MnII and additionally VV into Keggin&#8208;type heteropolyacids alongside comprehensive characterization of the new molecules is presented. The success of our syntheses was confirmed by vibrational spectroscopy (IR and Raman) and elemental analysis. Furthermore, the new compounds were analyzed by NMR spectroscopy to investigate the characteristics of the POMs in solution. The structures of successfully crystalized compounds were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Moreover, all synthesized compounds were characterized using UV/Vis spectroscopy and electrochemical analysis to get further insights into the electronic transfer processes and redox potentials.

         <title>Tetrathienyl Corannulene Compounds with Highly Sensitive Photochromism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Curves are ahead of the curve: Tetrathienyl corannulene compounds showed highly sensitive photochromism with a large molar absorption coefficient and a photocyclization quantum yield close to 1, although dithienyl phenanthrene compounds showed no photoreactivity. Such a high photoreactivity was rationalized by the predominance of the photoreactive atropisomers amplified by energy migration, and the curvature&#8208;induced short distance between photoreactive carbons.







Abstract
We have designed and synthesized photochromic tetrathienyl corannulene compounds, 1,2,7,8&#8208;tetrakis(2&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenylthiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)corannulene (1) and 1,2,7,8&#8208;tetrakis(2,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenylthiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)corannulene (2), by fusing two units of photochromic terarylene with a curved aromatic corannulene with a promising antenna effect. Compound 1 exhibited highly sensitive photoreactivity, with a large molar absorption coefficient of 8.2&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and practically photon&#8208;quantitative photocyclization. On the other hand, a terarylene derivative with a planar aromatic phenanthrene, 9,10&#8208;bis(2,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenylthiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phenanthrene (4) showed no photoreactivity. The reason for such a difference was attributed to the predominance of the photoreactive atropisomers amplified by energy migration, and the shortened distance between reactive carbons induced by the curved structure.

         <title>Regulating Extra&#8208;Framework Cations in Faujasite Zeolites for Capture of Trace Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The explicit structure&#8208;performance relationship and underlying mechanism of trace CO2 capture by faujasite zeolites are elucidated. Two robust adsorbents are screened out, namely Ba&#8722;X with high dynamic CO2 uptake and K&#8722;X with unprecedented resistance to moisture.







Abstract
The development of cost&#8208;effective sorbents for direct capture of trace CO2 (&lt;1&#8201;%) from the atmosphere is an important and challenging task. Natural or commercial zeolites are promising sorbents, but their performance in adsorption of trace CO2 has been poorly explored to date. A systematic study on capture of trace CO2 by commercial faujasite zeolites reveals that the extra&#8208;framework cations play a key role on their performance. Under dry conditions, Ba&#8722;X displays high dynamic uptake of 1.79 and 0.69&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at CO2 concentrations of 10000 and 1000&#8197;ppm, respectively, and shows excellent recyclability in the temperature&#8208;swing adsorption processes. K&#8722;X exhibits perfect moisture resistance, and &gt;95&#8201;% dry CO2 uptake can be preserved under relative humidity of 74&#8201;%. In situ solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and neutron diffraction reveal two binding sites for CO2 in these zeolites, namely the basic framework oxygen atoms and the divalent alkaline earth metal ions. This study unlocks the potential of low&#8208;cost natural zeolites for applications in direct air capture.

This study unlocks the potential of low-cost natural zeolites for applications in direct air capture.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembling Flavin for Visible Photooxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The different micellar and gel states formed by a flavin&#8208;based gelator can be used as effective and selective photocatalysts under visible light. The self&#8208;assembled structure formed directly translates into a difference in the activity of these structures in the photooxidation reactions.







Abstract
A new flavin&#8208;based gelator is reported which forms micellar structures at high pH and gels at low pH. This flavin can be used for the photooxidation of thiols under visible light, with the catalytic efficiency being linked to the self&#8208;assembled structures present.

Abstract
In an interview with Benjamin List, winner of the 2021 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, members of the Young Chemists&#8217; Network (JCF) of the German Chemical Society (GDCh) asked him about his science, his career, and the academic system. Benjamin List, Director at the Max&#8208;Planck&#8208;Institut f&#252;r Kohlenforschung in Germany, was awarded the Nobel Prize together with David W. C. MacMillan (Princeton University, USA) for the development of asymmetric organocatalysis. After studying chemistry at the Free University of Berlin, he received his doctorate from Goethe University in Frankfurt. He discovered the amino acid proline to be an efficient catalyst and thus co&#8208;founded the field of organocatalysis. In 2016, he received the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize, which is considered the most important research award in Germany.

         <title>Catalytic Activation of Imines by Chalcogen Bond Donors in a Povarov [4+2] Cycloaddition Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tellurium&#8208;based chalcogen bonding catalysts successfully activate a Povarov [4+2] cycloaddition with catalyst loadings as low as 1&#8197;mol&#8201;%, with different substrates, and in different solvents. Furthermore, new chiral chalcogen bonding catalysts were introduced and tested in this reaction, but only racemic mixtures of the product were obtained.







Abstract
Recently, chalcogen bonding has been investigated in more detail in organocatalysis and the scope of activated functionalities continues to increase. Herein, the activation of imines in a Povarov [4+2] cycloaddition reaction with bidentate cationic chalcogen bond donors is presented. Tellurium&#8208;based Lewis acids show superior properties compared to selenium&#8208;based catalysts and inactive sulfur&#8208;based analogues. The catalytic activity of the chalcogen bonding donors increases with weaker binding anions. Triflate, however, is not suitable due to its participation in the catalytic pathway. A solvent screening revealed a more efficient activation in less polar solvents and a pronounced effect of solvent (and catalyst) on endo&#8201;:&#8201;exo diastereomeric ratio. Finally, new chiral chalcogen bonding catalysts were applied but provided only racemic mixtures of the product.

         <dc:description>A novel one&#8208;pot reaction producing a metal vinylidene structure in a five&#8208;membered ring by cyclization of a multiyne has been achieved. The ring strain and the high stability of the cyclic metal vinylidene complexes have been analyzed experimentally and computationally. The metal vinylidene unit in a fused&#8208;ring complex is unreactive to both nucleophiles and electrophiles. It reacts however at the nearby carbonyl group achieving the unprecedented conversion of metal vinylidene to metal carbyne within the five&#8208;membered ring. The contributing factors for the aromaticity&#8208;driven process has been studied by DFT calculations.</dc:description>

In contrast to boronic acids, two concomitant oxidative rearrangements are involved in the complete oxidation of these species, which might represent a major limitation for an efficient effector (drug or fluorophore) release. Herein, we describe a comprehensive study of H  2  O  2  &#8208;mediated unsymmetrical arylborinic acid oxidation to investigate the factors that could selectively guide their oxidative rearrangement. The  o  &#8208;CF  3  substituent was found to be an excellent directing group since complete regioselectivity was obtained on borinic acid models. This result was successfully applied to synthesizing new borinic acid&#8208;based fluorogenic probes, which exclusively release the fluorescent moiety upon H  2  O  2  treatment. These compounds maintained their superior kinetic properties compared to boronic acids, thus further enhancing the potential of arylborinic acids as valuable new H  2  O  2  &#8208;sensitive triggers.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>High silica zeolite ZK&#8208;5 (framework Si/Al = 4.8) has been prepared by interzeolite conversion from ultrastable zeolite Y via a co&#8208;templating route using alkali metal cations and nitrate anions but without organic structure directing agents. The mechanism, which involves zeolite framework &#8208; alkali metal cation &#8208; nitrate anion ordering, has been established by a combination of chemical and thermal analyses, Raman spectroscopy, computational modelling and X&#8208;ray powder diffraction.

         <dc:description>Dendrimers are appealing scaffolds for creating carbohydrate mimics with unique multivalent cooperativity. We report here novel bola&#8208;amphiphilic glycodendrimers bearing mannose and glucose terminals, and a hydrophobic thioacetal core responsive to reactive oxygen species. The peculiar bola&#8208;amphiphilic feature enabled stronger binding to lectin compared to the conventional amphiphile. In addition, these dendrimers are able to target mannose receptors and glucose transporters expressed at the surface of cells, allowing effective and specific cellular uptake.&#160; All these highlight&#160;their great promise for targeted delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Cost&#8208;Effective 2D Ultrathin Metal&#8211;Organic Layers with Bis&#8208;Metallic Catalytic Sites for Visible Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As novel generated 2D materials, metal&#8208;organic layers (MOLs) have recently emerged as a potential platform for photocatalysis CO2 reduction reaction (PCO2RR). Such 2D structures negate the blemish of low&#8208;density catalytic sites and low electron transmission efficiency on the surface of MOFs, while retaining the advantage of low expenditure when using earth&#8208;abundant metal nodes and meritorious applicability in the PCO2RR. Herein, we report that the 2D ultrathin layer material with bis&#8208;metallic catalytic sites (Ni&#8208;O metal node and the Ni&#8208;N metal site) from bidentate ligand 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;5,5&#8217;&#8208;dicarboxylate (H2bpydc) and nickel (II) remarkably boosts the visible light&#8208;driven PCO2RR performance with a CO yield of 2400 mmol/g for 18 h and a selectivity up to 99%. Consequently, the effects of morphology, catalytic sites and intrinsic properties on PCO2RR efficiency have been investigated in detail. In this context, the ultrathin layer structrue has been elucidated as the key point to facilitate electron transfer efficiency. Notably, the bis&#8208;metallic catalytic sites with reasonable distance between two adjacent metals presumably induce synergistic effect, offering a guiding ideology for further designing high performance photocatalysts.</dc:description>

Herein, we report that the 2D ultrathin layer material with bis-metallic catalytic sites (Ni-O metal node and the Ni-N metal site) from bidentate ligand 2,2&#8217;-bipyridine-5,5&#8217;-dicarboxylate (H2bpydc) and nickel (II) remarkably boosts the visible light-driven PCO2RR performance with a CO yield of 2400 mmol/g for 18 h and a selectivity up to 99%. Consequently, the effects of morphology, catalytic sites and intrinsic properties on PCO2RR efficiency have been investigated in detail. In this context, the ultrathin layer structrue has been elucidated as the key point to facilitate electron transfer efficiency. Notably, the bis-metallic catalytic sites with reasonable distance between two adjacent metals presumably induce synergistic effect, offering a guiding ideology for further designing high performance photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Do Antarafacial Cycloadditions Occur? Cycloaddition of Heptafulvalene with Tetracyanoethylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antarafacial? No, suprafacial! The [14+2] cycloaddition of heptafulvalene with tetracyanoethylene has long been held as one of the only examples of an antarafacial cycloaddition. Experimental and computational studies demonstrate that it is not a concerted [14&#960;a+2&#960;s] process but instead a stepwise reaction that affords the trans&#8208;cycloadduct through suprafacial addition across the heptafulvalene ring system.







Abstract
The cycloaddition of heptafulvalene (1) with tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) was previously described as an example of an antarafacial cycloaddition, a [&#960;14a+&#960;2s] process that afforded only the trans cycloadduct by virtue of the edge&#8208;to&#8208;face approach of TCNE, facilitated by the S shape of 1. The reaction has been investigated in depth and found not to be a concerted antarafacial process. At low temperature, the reaction is observed to give a mixture of cis and trans cycloadducts as well as a [4+2] cycloadduct. The mixture of products is converted to the trans cycloadduct by equilibration upon warming to room temperature. Studies with diethyl 2,3&#8208;dicyanofumarate and &#8208;maleate confirmed the formation of cis cycloadducts. DFT studies at the M06&#8208;2X/6&#8208;311+G(2d,p) SCRF=acetone level of theory show that the originally proposed edge&#8208;to&#8208;face approach of TCNE to 1 is highly disfavored, whereas a stepwise mechanism involving the addition of TCNE at C2 to form a zwitterion followed by collapse at either C2&#8242; or C7&#8242; is energetically accessible. The Diels&#8208;Alder adduct is also formed in a stepwise reaction by competitive addition of TCNE at C4 of 1. These studies suggest that edge&#8208;to&#8208;face interactions are prohibitive in even the most favorable cases.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have prepared and characterized a sterically strained 32p&#8208;electron antiaromatic bis&#8208;BODIPY macrocycle  4  in which two BODIPY fragments are linked via  p  &#8208;divinylbenzene groups. Unlike regular BODIPYs, the fluorescence in this macrocycle is quenched. The broad signals in NMR spectra of the macrocycle were explained by the vibronic freedom of the  p  &#8208;divinylbenzene fragments. The possible diradicaloid nature of the macrocycle was excluded on a basis of variable&#8208;temperature EPR spectra in solution and the solid&#8208;state, which is indicative of its closed&#8208;shell quinoidal structure. The  meso  &#8208;C&#8208;H bond in the macrocycle and its precursor dialdehyde  3  forms a weak hydrogen bond with THF and is susceptible for the nucleophilic attack by organic amines and cyanide anion. The reaction products of such nucleophilic attack have  meso  &#8208;sp  3  carbon atoms and were characterized by NMR, mass spectrometry and, in some cases, X&#8208;ray crystallography. Unlike initial macrocycle  4  , the adducts have strong fluorescence in 400 nm region. The electronic structure and spectroscopic properties of new chromophores were probed by the Density Functional Theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations and correlate well with the experimental data.</dc:description>

         <title>The Mechanism of Biochemical NO&#8208;Sensing: Insights from Computational Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The production of cGMP and the resulting regulation of numerous physiological functions is regulated by the NO signaling pathway which occurs in soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC). Previously investigated by experiment, the exact details of the mechanism remain unclear, as two active states have been proposed. In this work, using computational techniques, we find that both active states are plausible, under different partial pressures of NO gas.







Abstract
The binding of small gas molecules such as NO and CO plays a major role in the signaling routes of the human body. The sole NO&#8208;receptor in humans is soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) &#8211; a histidine&#8208;ligated heme protein, which, upon NO binding, activates a downstream signaling cascade. Impairment of NO&#8208;signaling is linked, among others, to cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases. In the present work, we use a combination of theoretical tools such as MD simulations, high&#8208;level quantum chemical calculations and hybrid QM/MM methods to address various aspects of NO binding and to elucidate the most likely reaction paths and the potential intermediates of the reaction. As a model system, the H&#8208;NOX protein from Shewanella oneidensis (So H&#8208;NOX) homologous to the NO&#8208;binding domain of sGC is used. The signaling route is predicted to involve NO binding to form a six&#8208;coordinate intermediate heme&#8208;NO complex, followed by relatively facile His decoordination yielding a five&#8208;coordinate adduct with NO on the distal side with possible isomerization to the proximal side through binding of a second NO and release of the first one. MD simulations show that the His sidechain can quite easily rotate outward into solvent, with this motion being accompanied in our simulations by shifts in helix positions that are consistent with this decoordination leading to significant conformational change in the protein.

The influence of the size and doping effects of [TimSinO2(m+n)].+ (m+n=2, 3, 8, 10, 12, 14) clusters towards methane activation have been explored by using a combination of gas&#8208;phase experiments and quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
The size and doping effects in methane activation by Ti&#8722;Si&#8722;O clusters have been explored by using a combination of gas&#8208;phase experiments and quantum chemical calculations. All [TimSinO2(m+n)].+ (m+n=2, 3, 8, 10, 12, 14) clusters can extract a hydrogen from methane. The associated energies and structures have been revealed in detail. Moreover, the doping and size effects have been discussed involving generalized Kohn&#8208;Sham energy decomposition analysis, natural population analysis, Wiberg bond indexes (WBI), molecular polarity index (MPI) and ionization potential (IP). It suggested that Ti&#8722;Si&#8722;O clusters with a low Ti&#8201;:&#8201;Si ratio is beneficial to adsorbing methane and inclination to the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process, while the clusters with a high Ti&#8201;:&#8201;Si ratio favors the generation of a terminal oxygen radical and results in high reactivity and turnover frequency. On the other hand, a cluster size of m+n=12 is recommended considering both the ionization potential and the turnover frequency of the reaction. Hopefully, these finding will be instructive for the design of high&#8208;performance Ti&#8722;Si&#8722;O catalyst toward methane conversion.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Unsaturated Hydrocarbon Chains through C&#8722;S Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#8722;S activation is used in a surface&#8208;supported reaction to create a reticulated network of conjugated hydrocarbon chains on Cu(111). The reaction is initiated at low annealing temperature and the product is characterized by high&#8208;resolution scanning probe microscopy and photoelectron spectroscopy supported by DFT calculations.







Abstract
We use an on&#8208;surface synthesis approach to drive the homocoupling reaction of a simple dithiophenyl&#8208;functionalized precursor on Cu(111). The C&#8722;S activation reaction is initiated at low annealing temperature and yields unsaturated hydrocarbon chains interconnected in a fully conjugated reticulated network. High&#8208;resolution atomic force microscopy imaging reveals the opening of the thiophenyl rings and the presence of trans&#8208; and cis&#8208;oligoacetylene chains as well as pentalene units. The chemical transformations were studied by C 1s and S 2p core level photoemission spectroscopy and supported by theoretical calculations. At higher annealing temperature, additional cyclization reactions take place, leading to the formation of small graphene flakes.

         <title>Study of Carbamoyl Fluoride: Synthesis, Properties and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbamoyl fluorides are among the emerging fluorinated motifs. but are still quite underexplored. So, an efficient, fast, inexpensive, metal&#8208;free and easy&#8208;to&#8208;perform method to access such compounds easily, even with sophisticated molecules, is described. The physicochemical properties of these compounds were measured to give an insight into the potential of carbamoyl fluorides&#8212;in particular, their stability under close&#8208;to&#8208;physiological conditions. Finally, a first application in radiochemistry to obtain fluorine&#8208;18 radiolabeled compounds easily is proposed. More information can be found in the Research Article by F. Toulgoat, T. Billard, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201589).

With his hand holding the sail and his feet on the sailboard, the position of the windsurfer mimics the key strategy of this work: the activation of hydrogenated substrates by chelating coordination with cobalt. The surfer is the cobalt catalyst holding the sail to coordinate parazole, and with his foot on the hydrogenated substrate board to coordinate the vinyl group. Bubbles in the seawater represent the main reagent of the reaction, hydrogen, the dolphin represents the hydrogenated product of this reaction, and the wind represents the bisphosphine ligand that promotes the catalytic activity. Overall, the picture shows that the reaction we developed is powerful like the sport of surfing. More information can be found in the Research Article by Z. Zhang, W. Zhang, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201517).

         <title>Enhancement of Mass and Charge Transfer during Carbon Dioxide Photoreduction by Enhanced Surface Hydrophobicity without a Barrier Layer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
What you want, where you want it: Fewer H2O and more CO2 molecules can be delivered directly to an in&#8208;situ hydrophobic surface for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CH3OH. A traditional hydrophobic surface would hinder charge transfer, while for a hydrophilic surface, the low solubility and slow diffusion rate limit the mass transfer of CO2. Our in&#8208;situ surface fluorination strategy overcomes such mass and charge&#8208;transfer limitations enhancing the performance of CRR, which is a promising route for the clean utilization of renewable resources. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Li, E. Kan, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201034).

Bimetallic duet: The reactivity of a classical organometallic Pt complex, represented by a professional cello player, is enhanced by combined performance with an abundant and inexpensive metal like Zn, represented as a street musician on the left, leading to facile activation of H&#8722;H, B&#8722;H, and Si&#8722;H bonds, which does not occur during a solo performance by Pt alone. More about the bimetallic duet can be found in the Research Article by J.&#8197;R. Khusnutdinova and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201639).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first usefully&#8208;enantioselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation of &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoesters has been achieved using the Trost family of chiral ligands providing products in up to 92% ee. This work provides new insights that can address the typically modest selectivities associated with acyclic &#945;&#8208;fluoroenolates, and provides experimental evidence that the typically poor levels of enantiocontrol associated with these systems is not necessarily due to the presence of E/Z enolate mixtures. Finally, this methodology allows useful 3&#8208;fluoropiperidine intermediates to be easily prepared, and we demonstrate that these systems are amenable to a range of functionalization reactions leading to new building blocks for the discovery of bioactive products.</dc:description>

         <title>Flexible Alkylene Bridges as a Tool to Engineer Crystal Structures of Distyrylbenzene Enabling Highly Fluorescent Monomeric Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To design ultrabright fluorescent solid dyes, a crystal engineering strategy that enables monomeric emission by blocking intermolecular electronic interactions is required. We introduced propylene moieties to distyrylbenzene (DSB) as bridges between the phenyl rings either side of its C=C bonds. The bridged DSB derivatives formed compact crystals that emit colors similar to those of the same molecules in dilute solution, with high quantum yields. The introduction of flexible seven&#8208;membered rings to the DSB core produced moderate distortion and steric hindrance in the DSB &#960;&#8208;plane. However, owing to this strategy, it was possible to control the molecular arrangement with almost no decrease in the crystal density, and intermolecular electronic interactions were suppressed. The bridged DSB crystal structure differs from other DSB derivative structures; thus, bridging affords access to novel crystalline systems. This design strategy has important implications in many fields and is more effective than the conventional photofunctional molecular crystal design strategies.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Chiral bis(phosphine) monooxides (BPMOs) derived from C2&#8208;symmetric bis(phosphines) have been found to induce superior levels of enantioselection in copper&#8208;catalyzed conjugate borylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutenones. More precisely, enantiomeric excesses as well as chemical yields are exceedingly high with (R,R)&#8208;Bozphos as the chiral ligand while these values are low with parent (R,R)&#8208;Me&#8208;Duphos.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of group 1 hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble donor free aluminates [AM(  t  BuDHP)(TMP)Al(  i  Bu)  2  ] (AM = Li, Na, K, Rb) have been synthesised by combining an alkali metal dihydropyridyl unit [(2&#8208;  t  BuC  5  H  5  N)AM)] containing a surrogate hydride (sp  3  C&#8212;H) with [(  i  Bu)  2  Al(TMP)]. These aluminates have been characterised by X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. While the lithium aluminate forms a monomer, the heavier alkali metal aluminates exist as polymeric chains propagated by non&#8208;covalent interactions between the alkali metal cations and the alkyldihydropyridinyl units. Solvates [(THF)Li(  t  BuDHP)(TMP)Al(  i  Bu)  2  ] and [(TMEDA)Na(  t  BuDHP)(TMP)Al(  i  Bu)  2  ] have also been crystallographically characterised. Theoretical calculations show how the dispersion forces tend to increase on moving from Li to Rb, as opposed to the electrostatic forces of stabilization, which are orders of magnitude more significant. Having unique structural features, these bimetallic compounds can be considered as starting points for exploring unique reactivity trends as alkali&#8208;metal&#8208;aluminium hydride surrog[ATES].</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report herein a convenient and scalable dearomative hydroacylation reaction of indoles. Employing readily available aldehydes as the acyl source and TBADT as an inexpensive direct HAT photocatalyst, a variety of indoles derivatives were converted into synthetically interesting 2&#8208;acylindolines in good to excellent yields as well as great diastereoselectivity under mild conditions. An asymmetric version of the reaction was successfully developed and an experimental mechanistic investigation was carried out in order to gain further insights on the assumed reaction pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Superacid&#8208;Mediated Late&#8208;Stage Aromatic Polydeuteration of Pharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The simpler the better: While most of the recent studies on late&#8208;stage aromatic polydeuteration focus on the design of metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation procedures, an easy&#8208;to&#8208;setup and broadly applicable method based on the use of superacidic TfOD has been developed that opens new perspectives for the preparation of deuterated drugs.







Abstract
The field of medicinal chemistry is currently witnessing a deuterium rush owing to the remarkable properties of this element as bioisoster of hydrogen atom. Aromatic hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) is one of the most studied strategies nowadays as it promises to access deuterium&#8208;modified drugs directly from their non&#8208;labeled parents. While most of the recent studies focus on metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation strategy, the use of superacidic conditions has been largely overlooked. This study shows that the use of TfOD as reaction medium allows the late&#8208;stage polydeuteration of a broad library of pharmaceuticals bearing a wide array of functional groups, complementing existing procedures.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The simpler the better&lt;/b&gt;: While most of the recent studies on late-stage aromatic polydeuteration focus on the design of metal-catalyzed C&#8722;H activation procedures, an easy-to-setup and broadly applicable method based on the use of superacidic TfOD has been developed that opens new perspectives for the preparation of deuterated drugs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field of medicinal chemistry is currently witnessing a deuterium rush owing to the remarkable properties of this element as bioisoster of hydrogen atom. Aromatic hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) is one of the most studied strategies nowadays as it promises to access deuterium-modified drugs directly from their non-labeled parents. While most of the recent studies focus on metal-catalyzed C&#8722;H activation strategy, the use of superacidic conditions has been largely overlooked. This study shows that the use of TfOD as reaction medium allows the late-stage polydeuteration of a broad library of pharmaceuticals bearing a wide array of functional groups, complementing existing procedures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>New Approaches toward Building Csp&#8722;P bond: A Two&#8208;Decade Overview</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Preparation of 1&#8208;alkynylphosphorus compounds has seen significant developments. Transition metals proved to be particularly suitable catalysts allowing the transfer of alkynyl units to various phosphorus reagents forming phosphines, phosphine boranes, phosphine oxides and phosphonates. This review also reports metal&#8208;free approaches that use acidic or basic activation, hypervalent iodine reagents and desulfonative reactions.







Abstract
Since the review of Savignac, the past 20&#8197;years have seen significant progresses on the synthesis of alkynylphosphorus compounds considerably expanding the original and rather limited organic toolbox. This comprehensive review explores the latest and potentially greener methodologies using sustainable catalysis or direct metal&#8208;free couplings from stable and easy to handle precursors. Recent progress and mechanistic insights for metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions with a particular emphasis on copper, palladium, nickel and silver catalytic systems, photocatalytic and metal&#8208;free reactions are detailed covering most of the publications related to this field since 2000 until March 2022.

Abstract
A new series of ligands containing the 2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208; naphthyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methylbenzoxazole (HNBO) fluorophore showed selectivity for Mg2+ ions, without the interference of Ca2+.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Synthesis of Water&#8208;Soluble Gold Nanoparticles Stabilized by N&#8208;heterocyclic Carbenes: From Structural Characterization to Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have become attractive ligands for functionalizing gold nanoparticle surfaces with applications ranging from catalysis to biomedicine. Despite their great potential, NHC stabilized gold colloids (NHC@AuNPs) are still scarcely explored and further efforts should be conducted to improve their design and functionalization. Here, the &#8216;bottom&#8208;up&#8217; synthesis of two water&#8208;soluble gold nanoparticles (  AuNP&#8208;1  &#160;and&#160;  AuNP&#8208;2  ) stabilized by hydrophilic mono&#8208; and bidentate NHC ligands is reported together with their&#160; characterization by various spectroscopic and analytical methods. The NPs showed key differences likely to be due to the selected NHC ligand systems .&#160;Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed small&#160;  quasi  &#8208;spherical and faceted NHC@AuNPs of similar particle size (  ca  . 2.3 &#8208; 2.6 nm) and narrow particle size distribution, but the colloids featured different ratios of Au(I)/Au(0) by &#160; X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) . &#160; Furthermore,&#160; the NHC@AuNPs  &#160;  were supported  &#160;  on titania and fully characterized. The new NPs were studied for their catalytic activity towards the reduction of nitrophenol substrates, the reduction of resazurin and for&#160;their  &#160;  photothermal efficiency. Initial results on their application in photothermal therapy (PTT)&#160;were obtained in human cancer cells&#160;  in vitro  . The aforementioned reactions represent important model reactions towards waste water remediation, bioorthogonal transformations and cancer treatment</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature Driven Transformation of the Flexible Metal&#8208;Organic Framework DUT&#8208;8(Ni)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DUT&#8208;8(Ni) metal&#8208;organic framework belongs to the family of flexible pillared layer materials. The desolvated framework can be obtained in the open pore form (op) or in the closed pore form (cp), depending on the crystal size regime. In the present work, we report on the behaviour of desolvated DUT&#8208;8(Ni) at elevated temperatures. For both, op and cp variants, heating causes a structural transition, leading to an new, crystalline compound, containing two interpenetrated networks. The state of the framework before transition (op  vs.  cp) influences the transition temperature: the small particles of the op phase transform at significantly lower temperature in comparison to the macroparticles of the cp phase, transforming close to the decomposition temperature. The new compound, confined closed pore phase (ccp), was characterized by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and spectroscopic techniques, such as IR, EXAFS, and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS). Thermal effects of structural cp to ccp transitions were studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), showing an overall exothermic effect of the process, involving bond breaking and reformation. Theoretical calculations reveal the energetics, driving the observed temperature induced phase transition.</dc:description>

         <title>Ethylene Coordinative Chain Transfer Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly (CCTPISA)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Block copolymers based on ethylene (E) and butadiene (B) were prepared using the ansa &#8208;bis(fluorenyl complex {Me 2 Si(C 13 H 8 ) 2 Nd(BH 4 ) 2 Li(THF)} 2 in combination with ( n&#8208; Bu)( n&#8208; Oct)Mg (BOMAG) as a chain transfer agent. The diblock copolymers incorporating a soft poly(ethylene&#8208; co &#8208;butadiene) segment, called EBR for Ethylene Butadiene Rubber, and a hard polyethylene (PE) one were obtained by simply adjusting the different feeds of monomers during the polymerization. The soluble EBR block was formed first by feeding the catalytic system dissolved in toluene at 70 &#176;C with a mixture of ethylene and butadiene (E/B molar ratio = 80/20). Then the feeding was stopped leading to the consumption of a large part of the residual monomers. The reactor was finally fed with ethylene to form the PE block. By varying the molar mass of the latter, it is shown that the resulting soft&#8208; b &#8208;hard block copolymers can self&#8208;assemble simultaneously to the growth of the PE block in agreement with a polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) mechanism. The self&#8208;assembly is discussed considering the reaction conditions, the crystallization of the PE block and the polymerization mechanism involved.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Optical Chirality Sensing with a Sterically Encumbered Aminoborane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A sterically encumbered aminoborane sensor is introduced and used for quantitative stereochemical analysis of monoalcohols, diols and amino alcohols. The small&#8208;molecule probe exhibits a rigid ortho&#8208;substituted arene scaffold with a proximate boron binding site and a triarylamine circular dichroism (CD) reporter unit which proved to be crucial for the observed chiroptical signal induction. Coordination of the chiral target molecule produces strong Cotton effects and UV changes that are readily correlated to its absolute configuration, enantiomeric composition and concentration to achieve comprehensive stereochemical analysis within a 5% absolute error margin. The sensing method was successfully applied in the chromatography&#8208;free analysis of less than one milligram of a crude asymmetric reaction mixture and the advantages of this chiroptical sensing approach, which is amenable to high&#8208;throughput experimentation equipment and automation, over traditional methods is discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescent P&#8208;Hydroxyphosphole for Peptide Labeling through P&#8208;N Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward synthesis of new P&#8208;hydroxyphosphole&#8208;oxide and &#8208;sulfide based fluorophores exhibiting large Stokes shifts, and their coupling to biomolecules through the formation of P&#8722;N bond is presented herein. The fluorescent P&#8208;hydroxybinaphtylphosphole&#8208;oxide was coupled to a ghrelin receptor (GHSR) antagonist and the binding of the conjugates was highlighted by F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET).







Abstract
Synthesis of fluorescent P&#8208;hydroxybinaphtylphosphole&#8208;oxide or &#8208;sulfide was achieved by trapping a binaphtyl dianion with methyl dichlorophosphite or P&#8208;(N,N&#8208;diethylamino)dichlorophosphine, followed by oxidation or sulfuration of the P&#8208;center. After saponification or acid hydrolysis, the P&#8208;hydroxyphospholes were coupled to peptides using the coupling agent BOP, under the conditions required for the synthesis in solution or on a solid support. This new method was illustrated by the labeling of the JMV2959, a potent antagonist of the Growth Hormone Secretagogue Receptor type 1a (GHS&#8722;R1a). The labeled conjugates were used to characterize GHSR ligands by competition assays, based on Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). Such P&#8208;hydroxyphosphole&#8208;oxide or &#8208;sulfide constitute a promising new class of compact fluorophores with large Stokes shift, for labeling biomolecules by grafting through the phosphorus atom.

         <title>Structural and ITC Characterization of Peptide&#8208;Protein Binding: Thermodynamic Consequences of Cyclization Constraints, a Case Study on Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Does affinity come from constraint ? The thermodynamic and structural analysis of a series of constrained peptide ligands and unconstrained analogues accurately describes the binding process. It highlights how the variation in conformational and vibrational entropies associated with the constraints impacts the affinity.







Abstract
Macrocyclization constraints are widely used in the design of protein ligands to stabilize their bioactive conformation and increase their affinities. However, the resulting changes in binding entropy can be puzzling and uncorrelated to affinity gains. Here, the thermodynamic (Isothermal Titration Calorimetry) and structural (X&#8208;ray, NMR and CD) analysis of a complete series of lactam&#8208;bridged peptide ligands of the vascular endothelial growth factor, and their unconstrained analogs are reported. It is shown that differences in thermodynamics arise mainly from the folding energy of the peptide upon binding. The systematic reduction in conformational entropy penalty due to helix pre&#8208;organization can be counterbalanced by an unfavorable vibrational entropy change if the constraints are too rigid. The gain in configurational entropy partially escapes the enthalpy/entropy compensation and leads to an improvement in affinity. The precision of the analytical ITC method makes this study a possible benchmark for constrained peptides optimization.

         <title>[(CH3)Al(CH2)]12: Methylaluminomethylene (MAM&#8208;12)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The next stage towards the cage: [(CH3)Al(CH2)]12 (MAM&#8208;12) is accessible in high yield through Ga/Al transmetalation with homoleptic gallium methylene [Ga8(CH2)12] and trimethylaluminium. MAM&#8208;12 adopts a cage&#8208;like structure, similar to the structural motifs proposed for the elusive methylaluminoxane [(CH3)Al(O)]n (MAO), featuring three distinct aluminium coordinations. MAM&#8208;12 is insoluble in aliphatic/aromatic solvents and disaggregates to MAM&#8208;3 and [Me2Al&#8208;CH2&#8208;AlMe2] in a coordinating solvent like THF as suggested by a DOSY NMR experiments.







Abstract
The molecular structure of enigmatic &#8220;poly(aluminium&#8208;methyl&#8208;methylene)&#8221; (first reported in 1968) has been unraveled in a transmetalation reaction with gallium methylene [Ga8(CH2)12] and AlMe3. The existence of cage&#8208;like methylaluminomethylene moieties was initially suggested by the reaction of rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metallocene complex [Cp*2Lu{(&#956;&#8208;Me)2AlMe2}] with excess AlMe3 affording the deca&#8208;aluminium cluster [Cp*4Lu2(&#956;3&#8208;CH2)12Al10(CH3)8] in low yield (Cp*=C5Me5). Treatment of [Ga8(CH2)12] with excess AlMe3 reproducibly gave the crystalline dodeca&#8208;aluminium complex [(CH3)12Al12(&#956;3&#8208;CH2)12] (MAM&#8208;12). Revisiting a previous approach to &#8220;poly(aluminium&#8208;methyl&#8208;methylene&#8221; by using a (C5H5)2TiCl2/AlMe3 (1&#8201;:&#8201;100) mixture led to amorphous solids displaying solubility behavior and spectroscopic features similar to those of crystalline MAM&#8208;12. The gallium methylene&#8208;derived MAM&#8208;12 was used as an efficient methylene transfer reagent for ketones.

         <title>Carbon Dots for Carbon Dummies: The Quantum and The Molecular Questions Among Some Others</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite almost 20&#8201;years of intensive research on carbon dots (CDs), their actual nature remains obscure. This review aims at summarizing facts and conclusions from literature as well as bringing critical perspectives on the alleged quantum or molecular nature of CDs.







Abstract
Carbon Dots (CDs) are carbon nanoparticles which were discovered in 2004. Despite two decades of intensive work from the scientific community and a colossal amount of gathered experimental data, no definitive consensus exists to date on several key aspects such as the actual definition of CDs and the origin of their emissive properties. This review proposes a critical evaluation of these fundamental questions. Lay persons will also find here an alternative introduction to the CDs domain, including synthetic strategies, photophysical properties, as well as challenges and outlook of this exciting new area.

         <title>Photothermal Oxidation of Cinnamyl Alcohol with Hydrogen Peroxide Catalyzed by Gold Nanoparticle/Antimony&#8208;Doped Tin Oxide Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heat is on: Gold/antimony&#8208;doped tin oxide nanocrystals show thermally activated catalytic activity for the oxidation of cinnamyl alcohol to cinnamaldehyde by hydrogen peroxide. The catalytic activity increases with an increase in the Au particle size (dAu) at 5.3&#8804;dAu&#8804;8.2&#8197;nm. Light irradiation (&#955;ex &gt;660&#8197;nm, &#8764;0.5 sun) of Au/ATO NCs gives rise to an increase in the rate of reaction of more than two times with &#8764;95&#8201;% selectivity due to the photothermal effect of ATO NCs.







Abstract
Gold nanoparticles with different mean sizes were formed on antimony&#8208;doped tin oxide nanocrystals by the temperature&#8208;varied deposition&#8208;precipitation method (Au/ATO NCs). Au/ATO NCs possess strong absorption in the near&#8208;infrared region due to Drude excitation in addition to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of AuNPs around 530&#8197;nm. Au/ATO NCs show thermally activated catalytic activity for the oxidation of cinnamyl alcohol to cinnamaldehyde by hydrogen peroxide. The catalytic activity increases with a decrease in the mean Au particle size (dAu) at 5.3&#8197;nm&#8804;dAu&#8804;8.2&#8197;nm. Light irradiation (&#955;ex &gt;660&#8197;nm, &#8764;0.5 sun) of Au/ATO NCs increases the rate of reaction by more than twice with &#8764;95&#8201;% selectivity. Kinetic analyses indicated that the striking enhancement of the reaction stems from the rise in the temperature near the catalyst surface of &#8764;30&#8197;K due to the photothermal effect of the ATO NCs.

         <title>Diastereoselectivity is in the Details: Minor Changes Yield Major Improvements to the Synthesis of Bedaquiline
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bedaquiline fumarate is a crucial drug for treatment of multidrug&#8208;resistant tuberculosis. Improvements to the industrial synthesis are reported here that affords racemic bedaquiline in yields twice as high as those reported in patents, presenting an opportunity to dramatically improve the affordability of this drug. Close attention to reaction mechanism informed optimization of this synthesis by providing rationale for operational controls and reaction parameters that influence yield and diastereoselectivity in surprising ways.







Abstract
Bedaquiline is a crucial medicine in the global fight against tuberculosis, yet its high price places it out of reach for many patients. Herein, we describe improvements to the key industrial lithiation&#8208;addition sequence that enable a higher yielding and therefore more economical synthesis of bedaquiline. Prioritization of mechanistic understanding and multi&#8208;lab reproducibility led to optimized reaction conditions that feature an unusual base&#8208;salt pairing and afford a doubling of the yield of racemic bedaquiline. We anticipate that implementation of these improvements on manufacturing scale will be facile, thereby substantially increasing the accessibility of this essential medication.

         <title>1+1&gt;2: Fiber Synergy in Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mesoscopic aggregate is important to transfer or even amplify the molecular information in macroscopic materials. As an important branch of aggregate science, aggregation&#8208;induced emissive luminogens (AIEgens) often show slight or even no emission in solutions but exhibit bright emission when they aggregate, which open a new avenue for the practical applications. Due to the flexible and rotor structure of AIEgens, the aggregate structure of AIEgens is highly sensitive to the surrounding microenvironment, resulting in adjustable optical properties. Fibers integrated of a multiplicity of functional components are ideal carriers to control the aggregation processes, further assembly of fibers produces large&#8208;scale fabrics with amplified functions and practical values. In this Concept article, we focus on the latest advances on the synergy between &#8220;AIE + Fiber&#8221; for the boosted performance that beyond AIE, and their applications are presented and abstracted out to stimulate new ideas for developing &#8220;AIE + Fiber&#8221; systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to Pyridinyl or Pyridinium Aza&#8208;BODIPYs with Tunable Near&#8208;infrared Fluorescence through ICT from 4&#8208;Pyridinyl Pyrroles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aza&#8208;dipyrromethene boron difluoride (Aza&#8208;BODIPY) dyes have attracted much interest in recent decades. In this manuscript, we provide a facile way to access to pyridine&#8208;substituted pyrroles. A series of 1/7&#8208;pyridinyl and pyridinium NIR Aza&#8208;BODIPYs with/without rigidity were constructed and their spectroscopic properties were extensively investigated. These pyridinyl Aza&#8208;BOIDIPYs displayed slight bathochromic shifts and maintained bright NIR emission. Pyridinium Aza&#8208;BODIPYs showed increased bathochromic shift, however, the molar extinction coefficients and fluorescence quantum yields were decreased owing to ICT effect. The impacts followed the order of pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ium &gt; pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ium &gt; pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;ium, which was in consistence with their ICT strength. MO calculation was performed to provide possible explanation to the red&#8208;shifted absorption/emission, and apparent charge separation in pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ium Aza&#8208;BODIPYs. The pyridinium Aza&#8208;BODIPY localized in lysosome and potentially avoided harmful "alkalinizing effects" of traditional lysosome&#8208;targeting fluorescent dyes containing amine moiety. We are working on construction of pyridinyl and pyridinium Aza&#8208;BODIPY photosensitizers against microbials or tumors.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Insights of Non&#8208;fused Ring&#160;Acceptors for High&#8208;Performance Non&#8208;fullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>The non&#8208;fullerene acceptors with fused&#8208;ring structures have rapidly improved the performance of organic solar cells over the past five years, but they still suffer from large synthetic complexity and thus high materials cost, one of the major obstacles of hindering their commercialization process. Constructing non&#8208;fused ring acceptors (NFRAs) recently have been regarded as a feasible solution due to their facile synthesis and satisfactory device performance. Thus in this concept, we highlight the important progress of NFRAs in recent years, and discuss the key relationship between molecular design strategies and device performance. Finally, we provide some potential molecular insights for the future design of high&#8208;performance NFRAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Exfoliation of Two&#8208;Dimensional Phosphorene Sheets and its Energy Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents concise and crucial studies of the recent and most representative developments in electrochemical exfoliation of two&#8208;dimensional phosphorene sheets, including the relationship between exfoliation philosophy, internal mechanisms, processing techniques, and multiple applications of phosphorene. Finally, we also offer our insight into their future challenges and opportunities.







Abstract
Recently, single or few&#8208;layer phosphorene has attracted intense attention due to its exceptional physicochemical properties. To this end, mass production of high&#8208;quality phosphorene nanosheets with specific functionalities represents a pivotal factor for the basic academic studies and practical applications. Among the current synthetic methods, electrochemical exfoliation of black phosphorous is one of the most hopeful ways for mass&#8208;production of phosphorene sheets owing to the uncomplicated apparatus, low cost as well as significant efficiency. Especially, regulating the electrochemical parameters not only induces adjustable phosphorene characteristics but also enables them a promising candidate in energy applications. In this Review, a concise and crucial studies of the recent and most representative developments in this domain was introduced, including the relationship between exfoliation philosophy, internal mechanisms, processing techniques, and multiple applications of phosphorene. At the end, a summary discussion and future perspectives is also provided.

         <title>Real&#8208;Space Interpretation of Interatomic Charge Transfer and Electron Exchange Effects by Combining Static and Kinetic Potentials and Associated Vector Fields
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenomena of interatomic charge transfer and consequent electron exchange were explained in terms of space gaps between the zero&#8208;flux surfaces of atomic and electrostatic and kinetic potential&#8208;based basins. Behaviour of one&#8208;electron potentials included in the Euler equation for electron density and corresponding gradient force fields in crystals was studied.







Abstract
Intricate behaviour of one&#8208;electron potentials from the Euler equation for electron density and corresponding gradient force fields in crystals was studied. Channels of locally enhanced kinetic potential and corresponding saddle Lagrange points were found between chemically bonded atoms. Superposition of electrostatic 
 and kinetic 
 potentials and electron density 
 allowed partitioning any molecules and crystals into atomic 
&#8208; and potential&#8208;based 
&#8208;basins; 
&#8208;basins explicitly account for the electron exchange effect, which is missed for 
&#8208;ones. Phenomena of interatomic charge transfer and related electron exchange were explained in terms of space gaps between zero&#8208;flux surfaces of 
&#8208; and 
&#8208;basins. The gap between 
&#8208; and 
&#8208;basins represents the charge transfer, while the gap between 
&#8208; and 
&#8208;basins is a real&#8208;space manifestation of sharing the transferred electrons caused by the static exchange and kinetic effects as a response against the electron transfer. The regularity describing relative positions of 
&#8208;, 
&#8208;, and 
&#8208; basin boundaries between interacting atoms was proposed. The position of 
&#8208;boundary between 
&#8208; and 
&#8208;ones within an electron occupier atom determines the extent of transferred electron sharing. The stronger an H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bond is, the deeper hydrogen atom's 
&#8208;basin penetrates oxygen atom's 
&#8208;basin, while for covalent bonds a 
&#8208;boundary closely approaches a 
&#8208;one indicating almost complete sharing of the transferred electrons. In the case of ionic bonds, the same region corresponds to electron pairing within the 
&#8208;basin of an electron occupier atom.

         <title>Understanding the Reshaping of Fluorinated Polyester Vitrimers by Kinetic and DFT Studies of the Transesterification Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations and an experimental kinetic study of a transesterification reaction were conducted in order to quantitatively assess the effect of neighbouring fluorinated groups on the reaction rate and provide a molecular model for the observed accelerating effect of proximal fluorinated groups in the reshaping of transesterification vitrimers.







Abstract
Vitrimers are a third class of polymers gathering the mechanical properties and solvent resistance of 3D thermosets and the reprocessability of thermoplastics. This unique behaviour is due to the triggering of certain covalent exchange reactions that allow the network to rearrange upon application of a stimulus. The constitutive feature of vitrimers is the adoption of a glass&#8208;like viscosity during the rearrangement of the network, often due to an associative mechanism for the exchange reaction. Transesterification networks are one of the most studied type of vitrimers that usually require the incorporation of a catalyst, implying the associated drawbacks. Following up on a recent report on catalyst&#8208;free transesterification vitrimers in which the ester functions are particularly reactive thanks to the presence of fluorine atoms in &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;position, parallel DFT calculations and an experimental kinetic study on model molecules are presented in order to quantitatively assess the effect of neighbouring fluorinated groups on the transesterification reaction rate.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Syntheses of Alkylidenecyclopropanes from Allenoates with Donor&#8208;Acceptor and Diacceptor Diazo Reagents</title>

         <dc:description>
Chiral ACPs: The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of alkylidenecyclopropanes from electron&#8208;deficient allenes is described. The methodology, using donor&#8208;acceptor or diacceptor diazo reagents, catalyzed by a chiral rhodium complex furnished the corresponding ACPs in high yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The first diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective cyclopropanation reactions of electron&#8208;deficient allenes with donor&#8208;acceptor and diacceptor diazo reagents are described. The desired enantioenriched alkylidenecyclopropanes (ACPs) were obtained in high yields with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities in the presence of Rh2((S)&#8208;TCPTAD)4 or Rh2((R)&#8208;BTPCP)4 catalysts (up to 95&#8201;% yield, &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 d.r. and 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 e.r.). This methodology gave a direct access to ACPs bearing multiple electron&#8208;deficient substituents and allows to further expand the availability of ACPs chemistry. Interestingly, during the examination of the scope of this reaction, the asymmetric intramolecular C&#8722;H insertion reaction into tert&#8208;butyl group was observed as a side reaction with up to 94&#8201;:&#8201;6 e.r.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first diastereo- and enantioselective cyclopropanation reactions of electron-deficient allenes with donor-acceptor and diacceptor diazo reagents are described. The desired enantioenriched alkylidenecyclopropanes (ACPs) were obtained in high yields with high diastereo- and enantioselectivities in the presence of Rh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;((&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-TCPTAD)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or Rh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;((&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-BTPCP)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; catalysts (up to 95&#8201;% yield, &amp;gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 d.r. and 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 e.r.). This methodology gave a direct access to ACPs bearing multiple electron-deficient substituents and allows to further expand the availability of ACPs chemistry. Interestingly, during the examination of the scope of this reaction, the asymmetric intramolecular C&#8722;H insertion reaction into &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl group was observed as a side reaction with up to 94&#8201;:&#8201;6 e.r.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Carbene&#8208;Metal&#8208;Amido (CMA) Complexes and Their Use as Precatalysts for the Activator&#8208;Free, Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Addition of Carboxylic Acids to Alkynes</title>

         <dc:description>
A sustainable synthetic N&#8722;H metalation route to carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amido (CMA) complexes bearing backbone&#8208;modified (and classical) NHC ligands, carbazole and amines is presented. The CMAs are employed for the first time as precatalysts in the inter&#8208; and intramolecular addition of carboxylic acids to alkynes.







Abstract
A straightforward synthetic protocol leading to carbene&#8211;metal&#8211;amido (CMA) complexes (metal=Au, Cu) using a mild base and an environmentally desirable solvent (EtOH) has been explored, with a focus on complexes bearing backbone&#8208;substituted N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, including BIAN&#8208;NHCs (BIAN=bis(imino)acenaphthene). The novel CMAs were structurally characterized, and gold&#8208;based CMAs bearing diverse NHCs were screened as simple, Br&#248;nsted&#8208;basic precatalysts. The readily accessible complexes display high catalytic activity in the intermolecular and intramolecular hydrocarboxylation of internal alkynes and alkynoic acids respectively, while the screening reveals the ancillary ligand effect of NHCs in these catalytic systems.

         <title>Cyclic Disulfide Liposomes for Membrane Functionalization and Cellular Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Not just decoration: Cyclic disulfide lipids are reported that enable the convenient decoration of liposomal surfaces with functional molecules; this is demonstrated through biotinylation, which drives microplate immobilization. In addition, these lipids enhance cellular delivery when incorporated into liposomes, as evidenced by dose&#8208;dependent increases detected through fluorescence microscopy.







Abstract
Liposomes are effective therapeutic delivery nanocarriers due to their ability to encapsulate and enhance the pharmacokinetic properties of a wide range of therapeutics. Two primary areas in which improvement is needed for liposomal drug delivery is to enhance the ability to infiltrate cells and to facilitate derivatization of the liposome surface. Herein, we report a liposome platform incorporating a cyclic disulfide lipid (CDL) for the dual purpose of enhancing cell entry and functionalizing the liposome membrane through thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange. In order to accomplish this, CDL&#8208;1 and CDL&#8208;2, composed of lipoic acid (LA) or asparagusic acid (AA) appended to a lipid scaffold, were designed and synthesized. A fluorescence&#8208;based microplate immobilization assay was implemented to show that these compounds enable convenient membrane decoration through reaction with thiol&#8208;functionalized small molecules. Additionally, fluorescence microscopy experiments indicated dramatic enhancements in cellular delivery when CDLs were incorporated within liposomes. These results demonstrate that multifunctional CDLs serve as an exciting liposome system for surface decoration and enhanced cellular delivery.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Supported Potassium Hydride for Efficient Low&#8208;Temperature Desulfurization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;temperature desulfurization is developed based on graphite&#8208;supported potassium hydride. KH/C efficiently desulfurizes recalcitrant alkyl dibenzothiophenes, provides deoxygenation, denitrogenation and catalytic aromatic hydrogenation reactions. In addition, KH/C enables ultra&#8208;deep desulfurization of sulfur heterocycles (&lt;3&#8197;ppm [S]).







Abstract
The industrial removal of organosulfur impurities from fossil fuels relies on transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts in harsh conditions (ca. 400&#8201;&#176;C, up to 100&#8197;bar H2), yet desulfurization (DS) of refractory alkyl dibenzothiophenes (DBTs) remains challenging. Here, we report that carbon&#8208;supported potassium hydride (KH/C) enables efficient DS of DBTs in mild conditions, viz. &gt;97&#8201;% conversion of DBTs is achieved at 165&#8201;&#176;C in 3&#8211;6&#8197;h while the yields of respective biphenyls are 84&#8211;95&#8201;% by using only 15&#8201;% excess of KH per a C&#8722;S bond. In addition, KH/C allows to lower the concentration of 4,6&#8208;Me2DBT in the mesitylene solution from 1000&#8197;ppm to &lt;3&#8197;ppm (165&#8201;&#176;C, 20&#8197;h) and provides deoxygenation, denitrogenation and catalytic aromatic hydrogenation reactions. DS of various sulfur heterocycles by using KH/C, a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free material based on earth abundant elements, is viable at low temperature and has prospects for the further development towards decentralized removal of organosulfur species from fossil fuels.

         <title>Mechanical Bond Enhanced Lithium Halide Ion&#8208;Pair Binding by Halogen Bonding Heteroditopic Rotaxanes
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of selective lithium halide recognition by a mechanical bonded heteroditopic host is achieved using a series of halogen and hydrogen bonding [2]rotaxanes. A co&#8208;bound lithium cation switches on halide anion binding which increases greatly with increasing number of halogen bond donors. Ion&#8208;pair binding was not observed with the corresponding heteroditopic macrocycles, highlighting the importance of the mechanical bond effect.







Abstract
A family of novel halogen bonding (XB) and hydrogen bonding (HB) heteroditopic [2]rotaxane host systems constructed by active metal template (AMT) methodology, were studied for their ability to cooperatively recognise lithium halide (LiX) ion&#8208;pairs. 1H&#8197;NMR ion&#8208;pair titration experiments in CD3CN:CDCl3 solvent mixtures revealed a notable &#8220;switch&#8208;on&#8220; of halide anion binding in the presence of a co&#8208;bound lithium cation, with rotaxane hosts demonstrating selectivity for LiBr over LiI. The strength of halide binding was shown to greatly increase with increasing number of halogen bond donors integrated into the interlocked cavity, where an all&#8208;XB rotaxane was found to be the most potent host for LiBr. DFT calculations corroborated these findings, determining the mode of LiX ion&#8208;pair binding. Notably, ion&#8208;pair binding was not observed with the corresponding XB/HB macrocycles alone, highlighting the cooperative, heteroditopic, rotaxane axle&#8208;macrocycle component mechanical bond effect as an efficient strategy for ion&#8208;pair recognition in general.

         <title>Synthesis of 3,4&#8208;Dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;Pyrroles from Ketones, Aldehydes, and Nitro Alkanes via Hydrogenative Cyclization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly active, selective and reusable nickel catalyst has been developed and employed for the synthesis of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrroles via hydrogenation and subsequent cyclization of nitro ketones. The catalyst was identified from a library of 24 heterogeneous catalysts. The key to our hydrogenation/cyclization reaction is the tolerance of aldehydes and ketones as functional groups and the ability to hydrogenate aliphatic nitro compounds efficiently.







Abstract
Syntheses of N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds that permit a flexible introduction of various substitution patterns by using inexpensive and diversely available starting materials are highly desirable. Easy to handle and reusable catalysts based on earth&#8208;abundant metals are especially attractive for these syntheses. We report here on the synthesis of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrroles via the hydrogenation and cyclization of nitro ketones. The latter are easily accessible from three components: a ketone, an aldehyde and a nitroalkane. Our reaction has a broad scope and 23 of the 33 products synthesized are compounds which have not yet been reported. The key to the general hydrogenation/cyclization reaction is a highly active, selective and reusable nickel catalyst, which was identified from a library of 24 earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A highly active&lt;/b&gt;, selective and reusable nickel catalyst has been developed and employed for the synthesis of 3,4-dihydro-2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-pyrroles via hydrogenation and subsequent cyclization of nitro ketones. The catalyst was identified from a library of 24 heterogeneous catalysts. The key to our hydrogenation/cyclization reaction is the tolerance of aldehydes and ketones as functional groups and the ability to hydrogenate aliphatic nitro compounds efficiently.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Resolving Atomic&#8208;Scale Defects in Conjugated Polymers On&#8208;Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;surface synthesis not only allows growing nanomaterials that are not achievable by traditional wet chemistry but also, combined with scanning probe techniques, enables the structure and electronic properties to be resolved with atomic resolution. Here, atomic&#8208;scale structural defects are deliberately introduced into an anthracene&#8208;ethynylene &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer, and it is shown that such defects may give rise of &#960;&#8208;magnetism. These results demonstrate the potential of defect engineering strategy for fine&#8208;tuning the optoelectronic properties of conjugated polymers.







Abstract
Atomic scale defects significantly affect the mechanical, electronic, and optical properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers. Here, isolated atomic&#8208;scale defects are deliberately introduced into a prototypical anthracene&#8208;ethynylene &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer, and its local density of states is carefully examined on the atomic scale to show how individual defects modify the inherent electronic and magnetic properties of this one&#8208;dimensional systems. Scanning tunneling and atomic force microscopy experiments, supplemented with density functional theory calculations, reveal the existence of a sharp electronic resonance at the Fermi energy around certain defects, which is associated with the formation of a local magnetic moment accompanied by substantial mitigation of the mobility of charge carriers. While defects in traditionally synthesized polymers lead to arbitrary conformations, the presented results clearly reflect the preferential formation of low dimensional defects at specific polymer sites, which may introduce the possibility of engineering macroscopic defects in surface&#8208;synthesized conjugated polymers.

         <title>Achieving Solution&#8208;Processed Non&#8208;Doped Single&#8208;Emitting&#8208;Layer White Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes through Adjusting Pyrene&#8208;Based Polyaromatic Hydrocarbon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;emitting&#8208;layer white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (SEL&#8208;WOLEDs) have developed rapidly in recent years due to the outstanding advantages of high efficiency, simple device structure, low cost, less phase separation, and stable emission color. Nevertheless, the relatively complicated host&#8208;dopant system is usually essential for most previous SEL&#8208;WOLEDs and the development of simple non&#8208;doped SEL&#8208;WOLEDs lags behind. Hence the straightforward synthesis of single&#8208;white&#8208;emitting molecules for non&#8208;doped SEL&#8208;WOLEDs still remains a great challengeable task. In this article, we designed and synthesized two new pyrene&#8208;based polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and used them as emitting layer materials in the OLED devices. When the molecules change from the mono&#8208;fused one to bis&#8208;fused one, the emitting light changes from greenish to white color. Further study indicated that the bis&#8208;fused molecule PyD with more twisted and extended backbone packed in neat  Cmca  space group in single crystal system compared with  P2  1  /n  for PyS, which may be favorable to form excimers in the solid state and broaden the emission spectrum in the OLEDs. As a result, a solution&#8208;processed non&#8208;doped SEL&#8208;WOLED with high performance (e.g., a high color rendering index of 66) is reported. The findings will be beneficial not only to further development of simple WOLEDs, but also to other related organic optoelectronic technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Universal Trends between Acid Dissociation Constants in Protic and Aprotic Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>pKa values in nonaqueous solvents are of critical importance in many areas of chemistry. Despite their relevance our knowledge is still limited to the most fundamental properties and few pKa values in the most common solvents. Taking advantage of a recently introduced computationally efficient procedure we computed the pKa values of 182 compounds in 21 solvents. This data set is used to establish for the first time universal trends between all solvents. Our computations indicate, that the total charge of the molecule and the charge of the acidic group combined with the Kamlet&#8208;Taft solvatochromic parameters are sufficient to predict pKa values with at least semiquantitative accuracy. We find, that neutral acids such as alcohols are strongly affected by the solvent properties. This is contrasted by cationic acids like ammonium ions whose pKa is often almost completely independent from the choice of solvent.</dc:description>

         <title>Triplet&#8208;Triplet Energy Transfer Enabled Homolytic N&#8208;S Bond Cleavage in Vinyl Triflimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinyl triflimides are a new compound class with unknown reactivity. A computational analysis identified triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer (EnT) induced homolytic cleavage of the N&#8208;Tf bond as a highly interesting reaction type that may be accessible. A combination of experimental and mechanistic work verified this hypothesis and proved the generated radicals amenable for a radical&#8208;radical coupling reaction. Thereby, vinyl triflimides were transformed into a range&#160;of &#945;&#8208;quaternary, &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethylated amines in a 1,2&#8208;difunctionali&#173;za&#173;tion reaction with no need for external CF 3 &#8208;reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Improved reversible zinc storage achieved in a&#160;constitutionally crystalline&#8208;stable Mn(VO3)2 nanobelts cathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are potential for grid&#8208;scale applications owing to their safety, low price, and available sources. The development of ZIBs cathode with high specific capacity, wide operating voltage window and stable cyclability is urgently needed in next&#8208;generation commercial batteries. Herein, we report a structurally crystalline&#8208;stable Mn(VO  3  )  2  nanobelts cathode for ZIBs prepared  via  a facile hydrothermal method. The as&#8208;synthesized Mn(VO  3  )  2  exhibited high specific capacity of 350 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 0.1 A g  &#8208;1  , and maintained a capacity retention of 92% after 10,000 cycles at 2 A g  &#8208;1  . It also showed good rate performance and obtained a reversible capacity of up to 200 mAh g  &#8208;1  after 600 cycles at 0.2 A g  &#8208;1  under &#8208;20 &#9702;C. The electrochemical tests suggest that Mn(VO  3  )  2  nanobelts impart fast Zn  2+  ions migration, and the introduction of manganese atoms help make the structures more indestructible, leading to a good rate performance and prolonged cycle lifespan.</dc:description>

         <title>New Opportunities for Utilization of the Sulfoximine Group in Medicinal Chemistry from the Drug Designer&#8217;s Perspective</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Extension of the medicinal chemistry toolbox is in the vital interest of drug designers. However, the diffusion of an innovation can be a lengthy process. Along these lines, it took almost 70 years before the use of the sulfoximine group reached a critical mass in medicinal chemistry. Even though interest in this versatile functional group has increased exponentially in recent years, there is ample room for further innovative applications. This minireview highlights emerging trends and opportunities for drug designers for the utilization of the sulfoximine group in medicinal chemistry, such as in the construction of complex molecules, proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) and novel warheads for covalent inhibition.</dc:description>

         <title>Prussian Blue&#8208;Type Cocatalysts for Enhancing Photocatalytic Water Oxidation Performance of BiVO4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficiency of photocatalytic overall water splitting reaction is usually limited by the high energy barrier and complex multiple electron transfer processes of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Although bismuth vanadate (BiVO  4  ) as the photocatalyst has been developed for enhancing the kinetics of the water oxidation reaction, it still suffers from challenges of fast recombination of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs and poor photocatalytic activity. Herein, six M  II  &#8208;Co  III  Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn) cocatalysts are synthesized and deposited on the surface of BiVO  4  for boosting the surface catalytic efficiency and enhancing photogenerated carries separation efficiency of BiVO  4  . Six M  II  &#8208;Co  III  PBAs@BiVO  4  photocatalysts all demonstrate increased photocatalytic water oxidation performance compared to that of BiVO  4  alone. Among them, the Co&#8208;Co PBA@BiVO  4  photocatalyst is employed as a representative research object and is thoroughly characterized by electrochemistry, electronic microscope as well as multiple spectroscopic analyses. Notably, BiVO  4  coupling with Co&#8208;Co PBA cocatalyst could capture more photons than that of pure BiVO  4  , facilitating the transfer of photogenerated charge carriers between BiVO  4  and Co&#8208;Co PBA as well as surface catalytic efficiency of BiVO  4  . Overall, this work would promote the synthesis strategy development for exploring new types of composite photocatalysts for water oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Sterically Controlled Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization of Bulky Phosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fine&#8208;tuning of metal&#8208;phosphine catalyzed reactions relies largely on accessing ever more precisely tuned phosphine ligands via  de novo  synthesis. Late&#8208;stage C&#8211;H functionalization and diversification of commercial phosphines offers rapid access to entire libraries of derivatives based on privileged scaffolds. But existing routes, relying on phosphorous&#8208;directed transformations, only yield functionalization of C  sp  2&#8211;H bonds in a specific position relative to phosphorous. In contrast to phosphorous&#8208;directed strategies, herein we disclose an orthogonal functionalization strategy capable of introducing a range of substituents into previously inaccessible positions on arylphosphines. The strongly coordinating phosphine group acts solely as a bystander in the sterically controlled borylation of bulky phosphines, and the resulting borylated phosphines serve as the supporting ligand for palladium during diversification via phosphine self&#8208;assisted Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrahalidometallate(II) ionic liquids with more than one metal: the effect of bromide vs. chloride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fifteen  N  &#8208;butylpyridinium salts, including five monometallic [C  4  Py]  2  [MBr  4  ] and ten bimetallic [C  4  Py]  2  [M  0.5  a  M  0.5  b  Br  4  ] (M = Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Zn), were synthesized. Their structure and their thermal and electrochemical properties were studied. All compounds are ionic liquids (ILs) with melting points between 64 and 101&#176;C. Powder and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction shows that all ILs are isostructural. The electrochemical stability windows of the ILs are between 2 and 3 V. The conductivities at room temperature are between 10  &#8208;4  and 10  &#8208;8  S cm  &#8208;1  . At elevated temperatures, the conductivities reach up to 10  &#8208;2  S cm  &#8208;1  at 70&#176;C. The article also compares the structures and properties of the current bromide&#8208;based ILs with previous examples using chloride ligands and illustrates differences and similarities between the two groups of ILs.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling Enzymatic Features in a Supramolecular Iridium Catalyst by Computational Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;biological catalysts following the governing principles of enzymes are attractive systems to disclose unprecedented reactivities. Most of those existing catalysts feature an adaptable molecular recognition site for substrate binding that are prone to undergo conformational selection pathways. Herein, we present a non&#8208;biological catalyst able to bind substrates via the induced fit model according to in&#8208;depth computational calculations. The system, which is constituted by an inflexible substrate&#8208;recognition site derived from a zinc&#8208;porphyrin in the second coordination sphere, features destabilization of ground states as well as stabilization of transition states for the relevant iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H bond borylation of pyridine. In addition, this catalyst appears to be most suited to tightly bind the transition state rather than the substrate. Besides these features, which are reminiscent from the action mode of enzymes, new elementary catalytic steps have been disclosed owing to the unique distortions encountered in the different intermediates and transition states.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferroelasticity&#160;in Organic&#8208;inorganic Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular ferroelastics have received particular attention for potential applications in mechanical switches, shape memory, energy conversion, information processing, and solar cells, by taking advantages of their low&#8208;cost, light&#8208;weight, easy preparation, and mechanical flexibility. The unique structures of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites have been considered to be a design platform for symmetry breaking&#8208;associated order&#8208;disorder in lattice, thereby possessing great potential for ferroelastic phase transition. Herein, we review the research progress of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite ferroelastics in recent years, focusing on the crystal structures, dimensions, phase transitions and ferroelastic properties. In view of the few reports on molecular&#8208;based hybrid ferroelastics, we look forward to the structural design strategies of molecular ferroelastic materials, as well as the opportunities and challenges faced by molecular&#8208;based hybrid ferroelastic materials in the future. This review will have positive guiding significance for the synthesis and future exploration of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid molecular ferroelastics.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemistry of pentafluorosulfanyl derivatives and related analogs: from synthesis to applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pentafluorosulfanyl (SF  5  )&#8208;containing compounds and corresponding analogs are a highly valuable class of fluorine&#8208;containing building blocks owing to their unique properties. The reason for that is the set of peculiar and tremendously beneficial characteristics they can impart on molecules once introduced onto them. Despite this, their application in distinct scientific fields remains modest, given the extremely harsh reaction conditions needed to access such compounds. The recent synthetic approaches via S&#8211;F, and C&#8211;SF  5  bond formation as well as the use of SF  5  &#8208;containing building blocks embody a &#8220;stairway&#8208;to&#8208;heaven&#8221; loophole in the synthesis of otherwise&#8208;inaccessible chemical scaffolds only a few years ago. Herein, we report and evaluate the properties of the SF  5  group and analogs, by summarizing synthetic methodologies available to access them as well as following applications in material science and medicinal chemistry since 2015.</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial Antiferromagnets Possessing Extended&#160;0&#8208;, 1&#8208;, 2&#8208;, and 3&#8208;Dimensional Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered (2&#8208;D) artificial (or synthetic) antiferromagnets are fabricated via atom deposition techniques and possess very thin, nanometer scale, magnetically ordered layers separated via a very thin nonmagnetic layer that antiferromagnetically couples the magnetic layers. Artificial antiferromagnets were crucial in the discovery of the giant magnetic effect (GMR), which had an incredible impact on the evolution of computer memory and their applications and nucleated the dawn of spintronics (magnetoelectrics). The fundamental structural motif has been more recently achieved using synthetic chemical methods that led to insulating artificial antiferromagnets. Examples of magnetically ordered layers that are antiferromagnetic coupled to form artificial antiferromagnets have been extended to isolated ions (0&#8208;D) as well as extended chain (1&#8208;D) and 3&#8208;D extended network structures, and new phenomena and applications are anticipated as insulating antiferromagnets are more effective at propagating spin currents with respect to dielectric materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Formylglycine&#8208;Peptide for the Site&#8208;Directed Identification of Phosphotyrosine&#8208;Mimetic Fragments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discovery of protein&#8208;binding fragments for precisely defined binding sites is an unmet challenge so far. Here, we investigate formylglycine as a molecular probe for the sensitive detection of fragments binding to a spatially defined protein site. Formylglycine peptide&#160;  3&#160;  was derived from a phosphotyrosine&#8208;containing peptide substrate of protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B by replacing the phosphorylated amino acid with the reactive electrophile. Fragment ligation with formylglycine occurred in&#8208;situ in aqueous physiological buffer. Structures and kinetics were validated by NMR spectroscopy. Screening and hit validation revealed fluorinated and non&#8208;fluorinated hit fragments being able to replace the native phosphotyrosine residue. The formylglycine probe identified low&#8208;affinity fragments with high spatial resolution as substantiated by molecular modelling. The best fragment hit, 4&#8208;amino&#8208;phenyl&#8208;acetic acid, was converted into a cellularly active, nanomolar inhibitor of the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2.</dc:description>

         <title>Intense Molar Circular Dichroism in Fully Conjugated All&#8208;Carbon Macrocyclic 1,3&#8208;Butadiyne Linked pseudo&#8208;meta [2.2]Paracyclophanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthetic access to macrocyclic molecular topologies with interesting photophysical properties has greatly improved thanks to the successful implementation of organic and inorganic corner units. Based on recent reports, we realized pseudo&#8208;  meta  [2.2]para&#173;cyclo&#173;phanes (PCPs) might serve as optimal corner units for constructing 3D functional materials, owing to their efficient electronic communication, angled substituents and planar chirality. Herein, we report the synthesis, characterization and optical properties of four novel all&#8208;carbon enantiopure macrocycles bearing three to six pseudo&#8208;  meta  PCPs linked by 1,3&#8208;butadiyne units. The macrocycles were obtained by a single step from enantiopure literature known dialkyne pseudo&#8208;  meta  PCP and were unambiguously identified and characterized by state of the art spectroscopic methods and in part even by x&#8208;ray crystallography. By comparing the optical properties to relevant reference compounds, we show that the pseudo&#8208;  meta  PCP subunit effectively elongates the conjugated system throughout the macrocyclic backbone, such that already the smallest macrocycle consisting of only three subunits reaches an astounding polymer&#8208;like conjugation length. Additionally, we show that the chiral pseudo&#8208;  meta  PCPs induce remarkable chiroptical response in the respective macrocycles, reaching unprecedented high molar dichroism values for all&#8208;carbon macrocycles of up to 1307 L mol  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;1  .</dc:description>

         <title>The Importance of Mg2+&#8208;free State in Nucleotide Exchange of Oncogenic K&#8208;Ras Mutants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For efficient targeting of oncogenic K&#8208;Ras interaction sites, a mechanistic picture of the Ras&#8208;cycle is necessary. Herein, we used NMR relaxation techniques and molecular dynamics simulations to decipher the role of slow dynamics in wild&#8208;type and three oncogenic P&#8208;loop mutants of K&#8208;Ras. Our measurements reveal a dominant two&#8208;state conformational exchange on the ms timescale in both GDP&#8208; and GTP&#8208;bound K&#8208;Ras. The identified low&#8208;populated higher energy state in GDP&#8208;loaded K&#8208;Ras has a conformation reminiscent of a nucleotide&#8208;bound/Mg  2+  &#8208;free state characterized by shortened &#946;2/&#946;3&#8208;strands and a partially released switch&#8208;I region preparing K&#8208;Ras for the interaction with the incoming nucleotide exchange factor and subsequent reactivation. By providing insight into mutation&#8208;specific differences in K&#8208;Ras structural dynamics, our systematic analysis improves our understanding of prolonged K&#8208;Ras signaling and may aid the development of allosteric inhibitors targeting nucleotide exchange in K&#8208;Ras.</dc:description>

The identified low-populated higher energy state in GDP-loaded K-Ras has a conformation reminiscent of a nucleotide-bound/Mg  2+  -free state characterized by shortened &#946;2/&#946;3-strands and a partially released switch-I region preparing K-Ras for the interaction with the incoming nucleotide exchange factor and subsequent reactivation. By providing insight into mutation-specific differences in K-Ras structural dynamics, our systematic analysis improves our understanding of prolonged K-Ras signaling and may aid the development of allosteric inhibitors targeting nucleotide exchange in K-Ras.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>[Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase, the third type of natural hydrogenase, is capable to heterolytically activate hydrogen molecule and transfer the resulting hydride to an unsaturated substrate, making it a promising hydrogenation catalyst. Over the last three decades, fruitful results on this enzyme have been achieved. In this review, we summarized the major progresses about this enzyme including its structural characterisation, catalytic mechanism, cofactor biosynthesis, mimetic model development as well as artificial enzyme construction. In the meanwhile, challenges and opportunities of this enzyme or its mimetic systems in the application of synthetic chemistry and others are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Reverse Replacement in NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 with 1,4&#8208;Dicarboxybenzene for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) constructed by the ligands and metal clusters, have been considered as a promising material for photocatalytic water splitting. In this work, a solvent&#8208;assisted ligand exchange (SALE) method has been applied through partial reverse substitution of the ligand in NH  2  &#8208;MIL&#8208;125 (Ti) by 1,4&#8208;dicarboxybenzene (BDC). This modification strategy can optimize the charge transfer dynamics together with the preserved light absorption, resulting in a 3.3 times enhancement of the hydrogen production rate than the pristine material under visible&#8208;light irradiation. This work broadens the pathway of the ligand modifications of MOFs to boost the photocatalytic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Biohybrid Organic Heterostructure Based on Chlorophyll&#8208;Bacteriochlorophyll Aggregates for Ecofriendly Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the fact that hydrogen energy is an abundant, clean, sustainable and environmentally friendly renewable energy source. Therefore, the production of hydrogen by photocatalytically splitting water on semiconductors has been considered in recent years as a promising and sustainable strategy for converting solar energy into chemical energy to replace conventional energy sources and to solve the growing problem of environmental pollution and the global energy crisis. However, highly efficient solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen production remains a huge challenge due to the poor visible light response of available photocatalytic materials and the low efficiency of separation and transfer of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs. In the present work, organic heterojunction structures based on bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) and chlorophyll (Chl) molecules were introduced and used for solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen production from water under visible light. Also, noble metal&#8208;free photocatalyst was successfully constructed on Ti3C2Tx  nanosheets by simple successive deposition of Chl and BChl, which was used for the photocatalytic splitting water to hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The results show that the optimal BChl@Chl@Ti3C2Tx  composite has a high HER performance with 114 &#956;mol/h/gcat  , which is much higher than the BChl@Ti3C2Tx  and Chl@Ti3C2Tx  composites.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Construction of lanthanide heterometallic complex is important for engineering multifunction molecular containers. However, it remains a challenge because of the similar ionic radii of lanthanides. Herein we attempt to prepare chiral lanthanide heterometallic tetrahedron.

         <title>Post&#8208;Synthesis Conversion of an Unstable Imine Cage to a Stable Cage with Amide Moieties towards Selective Receptor for Fluoride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of robust covalent macrocycles/cages via multiple amide&#8208;bond forming reaction is highly challenging and generally it needs multistep reactions. One&#8208;pot reaction of appropriate di&#8208;/tri&#8208;acyl chloride with a diamine generally results polymers or oligomers instead of discrete architectures. To overcome this limitation, a strategy is reported here using dynamic imine chemistry for facile construction of imine&#8208;based macrocycle and cage upon treatment of a diamine with di&#8208; and tri&#8208;aldehydes respectively, followed by post&#8208;synthesis one&#8208;step conversion of imine bonds to amides to form the desired robust macrocycle and cage containing multiple amide bonds. While the macrocycle was found to form aggregates in DMSO, the cage was intact without any aggregation. Six amide groups in the confined pocket of the cage made it an ideal receptor for selective binding of fluoride with very high selectivity (~3 103 fold) over chloride, and it was silent towards other halides, phosphate, and other oxyanions.</dc:description>
