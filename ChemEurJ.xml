         <title>Iron Binding in the Ferroxidase Site of Human Mitochondrial Ferritin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ferritins are nanocage proteins that store iron ions in their central cavity as hydrated ferric oxide biominerals. In mammals, further the L (light) and H (heavy) chains constituting cytoplasmic maxi&#8208;ferritins, an additional type of ferritin has been identified, the mitochondrial ferritin (MTF). Human MTF (hMTF) is a functional homopolymeric H&#8208;like ferritin performing the ferroxidase activity in its ferroxidase site (FS), in which Fe(II) is oxidized to Fe(III) in the presence of dioxygen. To better investigate its ferroxidase properties, here we performed time&#8208;lapse X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis of hMTF, providing structural evidence of how iron ions interact with hMTF and of their binding to the FS. Transient iron binding sites, populating the pathway along the cage from the iron entry channel to the catalytic center, were also identified. Furthermore, our kinetic data at variable iron loads indicate that the catalytic iron oxidation reaction occurs via a diferric peroxo intermediate followed by the formation of ferric&#8208;oxo species, with significant differences with respect to human H&#8208;type ferritin.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Oxygen &#8208; bearing motifs, mainly the congener heterocycles are ubiquitous due to their presence in various natural products and bioactive scaffolds. Although in literature, several strategies have been developed for their synthesis, hydroalkoxylation of alkynes has come forward as a method of choice and has been used extensively.&#160; In particular, hydroalkoxylation of alkynes has gained enormous attention from the synthetic community due to the rapid access to a very useful and reactive synthetic intermediate like &#8216;enol ether&#8217;. Furthermore, to manifold the utility of these methods, reports have been developed elaborating the generation of &#8216;enol ether&#8217; using hydroalkoxylation and their usage in various reactions in cascade or tandem manner.

         <title>An Optimized Protocol for the Synthesis of Peptides Containing trans&#8208;Cyclooctene and Bicyclononyne Dienophiles as Useful Multifunctional Bioorthogonal Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple methodology for the introduction of two strained dienophiles, bicyclononyne (BCN) and trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO), into synthetic peptides is presented. The method is based on the post&#8208;synthetic attachment of the clickable groups to lysine residues after selective deprotection steps. The resulting peptides can be used for construction of useful peptide conjugates in highly efficient and biocompatible manner via two orthogonal click reactions, the strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) and the inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder reaction (iEDDA).







Abstract
Despite the great advances in solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), the incorporation of certain functional groups into peptide sequences is restricted by the compatibility of the building blocks with conditions used during SPPS. In particular, the introduction of highly reactive groups used in modern bioorthogonal reactions into peptides remains elusive. Here, we present an optimized synthetic protocol enabling installation of two strained dienophiles, trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) and bicyclononyne (BCN), into different peptide sequences. The two groups enable fast and modular post&#8208;synthetic functionalization of peptides, as we demonstrate in preparation of peptide&#8208;peptide and peptide&#8208;drug conjugates. Due to the excellent biocompatibility, the click&#8208;functionalization of the peptides can be performed directly in live cells. We further show that the introduction of both clickable groups into peptides enables construction of smart, multifunctional probes that can streamline complex chemical biology experiments such as visualization and pull&#8208;down of metabolically labeled glycoconjugates. The presented strategy will find utility in construction of peptides for diverse applications, where high reactivity, efficiency and biocompatibility of the modification step is critical.

         <title>Structure Elucidation of Complex Endotaxially Intergrown Lanthanum Barium Oxonitridosilicate Oxides by Combination of Microfocused Synchrotron Radiation and Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystalline domains of microcrystalline intergrown oxonitridosilicate oxides Ba22.5+xLa55&#8722;x[Si129N240&#8722;xOx]O3 and Ba25.5+xLa77&#8722;x[Si170N312&#8722;xO9+x]O4 and related Sr analogues were identified by TEM. Diffraction data collected with microfocused synchrotron radiation reveal extraordinarily complex tetrahedra networks. This combination of analytical methods enables the characterization of new luminescent materials in heterogeneous powder samples.







Abstract
Single&#8208;crystalline domains in intergrown microcrystalline material of the new compounds Ba22.5+xLa55&#8722;x[Si129N240&#8722;xOx]O3:Ce3+ and Ba25.5+xLa77&#8722;x[Si170N312&#8722;xO9+x]O4:Ce3+ were identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Precise diffraction data from these domains were collected with microfocused synchrotron radiation so that crystal structure elucidation of the complex disordered networks became possible. They are composed of two different interconnected slabs of which one is similar in both compounds, which explains their notorious intergrowth. The distribution of Ba and La is indicated by the analysis of bond&#8208;valence sums and by comparison with isostructural Sr28.5+xLa75&#8722;x[Si170N312&#8722;xO9+x]O4. Ce3+ doping leads to yellow luminescence. This is a showcase that highlights the discovery and accurate characterization of new compounds relevant for luminescence applications from heterogeneous microcrystalline samples by exploiting the capability of the combination of TEM and diffraction using the latest focusing techniques for synchrotron radiation.

         <title>Ultradoping Boron on Si(100) via Solvothermal Chemistry**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultradoping, i.&#8201;e. using direct dopant&#8208;Si chemical bonds to dope past the Si solid solubility limit, changes the behavior of Si and makes it promising for use in next&#8208;generation devices. While solvothermal methods enable scalability and commercialization, there is little precedence for solvothermal formation of on&#8208;surface B&#8722;Si bonds. This work provides the first demonstration of solvothermally achieving ultradoping levels of B (&#8764;1e14&#8197;cm2).







Abstract
Ultradoping introduces unprecedented dopant levels into Si, which transforms its electronic behavior and enables its use as a next&#8208;generation electronic material. Commercialization of ultradoping is currently limited by gas&#8208;phase ultra&#8208;high vacuum requirements. Solvothermal chemistry is amenable to scale&#8208;up. However, an integral part of ultradoping is a direct chemical bond between dopants and Si, and solvothermal dopant&#8208;Si surface reactions are not well&#8208;developed. This work provides the first quantified demonstration of achieving ultradoping concentrations of boron (&#8764;1e14&#8197;cm2) by using a solvothermal process. Surface characterizations indicate the catalyst cross&#8208;reacted, which led to multiple surface products and caused ambiguity in experimental confirmation of direct surface attachment. Density functional theory computations elucidate that the reaction results in direct B&#8722;Si surface bonds.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ultradoping&lt;/b&gt;, i.&#8201;e. using direct dopant-Si chemical bonds to dope past the Si solid solubility limit, changes the behavior of Si and makes it promising for use in next-generation devices. While solvothermal methods enable scalability and commercialization, there is little precedence for solvothermal formation of on-surface B&#8722;Si bonds. This work provides the first demonstration of solvothermally achieving ultradoping levels of B (&#8764;1e14&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultradoping introduces unprecedented dopant levels into Si, which transforms its electronic behavior and enables its use as a next-generation electronic material. Commercialization of ultradoping is currently limited by gas-phase ultra-high vacuum requirements. Solvothermal chemistry is amenable to scale-up. However, an integral part of ultradoping is a direct chemical bond between dopants and Si, and solvothermal dopant-Si surface reactions are not well-developed. This work provides the first quantified demonstration of achieving ultradoping concentrations of boron (&#8764;1e14&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) by using a solvothermal process. Surface characterizations indicate the catalyst cross-reacted, which led to multiple surface products and caused ambiguity in experimental confirmation of direct surface attachment. Density functional theory computations elucidate that the reaction results in direct B&#8722;Si surface bonds. This proof-of-principle work lays groundwork for emerging solvothermal ultradoping processes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synergistic Engineering of Defects and Heterostructures Enhance Lithium/Sodium Storage Properties of F&#8208;SnO2&#8208;x&#8208;SnS2&#8208;x Nanocrystals Supported on N,S&#8208;Graphene</title>

F&#8208;SnO2&#8208;x&#8208;SnS2&#8208;x@N/S&#8208;RGO nanocomposite, which is featured by the heterostructures that originated from coupling SnO2 and SnS2, defects caused by F doping and VO/VS, is investigated as an anode for LIBs/SIBs. It renders extraordinary performances in both Li and Na ion batteries (LIBs, SIBs), due to the unique hierarchical structure and electronic characteristics. The rational designation is instructive to the exploitation of other similar anodes for superior Li/Na/K storage performance.







Abstract
Phase engineering of the electrode materials in terms of designing heterostructures, introducing heteroatom and defects, improves great prospects in accelerating the charge storage kinetics during the repeated Li+/Na+ insertion/deintercalation. Herein, a new design of Li/Na&#8208;ion battery anodes through phase regulating is reported consisting of F&#8208;doped SnO2&#8208;SnS2 heterostructure nanocrystals with oxygen/sulfur vacancies (VO/VS) anchored on a 2D sulfur/nitrogen&#8208;doped reduced graphene oxide matrix (F&#8208;SnO2&#8208;x&#8208;SnS2&#8208;x@N/S&#8208;RGO). Consequently, the F&#8208;SnO2&#8208;x&#8208;SnS2&#8208;x@N/S&#8208;RGO anode demonstrates superb high reversible capacity and long&#8208;term cycling stability. Moreover, it exhibits excellent great rate capability with 589&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 for Li+ and 296&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for Na+. The enhanced Li/Na storage properties of the nanocomposites are not only attributed to the increase in conductivity caused by VO/VS and F doping (confirmed by DFT calculations) to accelerate their charge&#8208;transfer kinetics but also the increased interaction between F&#8208;SnO2&#8208;x&#8208;SnS2&#8208;x and Li/Na through heterostructure. Meanwhile, the hierarchical F&#8208;SnO2&#8208;x&#8208;SnS2&#8208;x@N/S&#8208;RGO network structure enables fast infiltration of electrolyte and improves electron/ion transportation in the electrode, and the corrosion resistance of F doping contributes to prolonged cycle stability.

         <title>Electroresponsive Performances of Ecoresorbable Smart Fluids Consisting of Various Plant&#8208;Derived Carrier Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper proposes the fabrication of a new type of electrorheological (ER) fluid with ecoresorbable features as well as excellent electroresponsive performance. The proposed ER fluid consists of biocompatible Mg&#8208;doped silica/titania hollow nanoparticles (ST HNPs) suspended in vegetable oils (canola, grapeseed, olive, and soy). The effects of biodegradable plant&#8208;derived carrier liquids on the ER performance are analyzed. The polarizability and wettability of the fabricated ER fluids are studied. The high polarizability of the nanoparticles contributes to the high electroresponsive performance by inducing electrostatic interactions between the nanoparticles under electric fields, which enables the formation of a rigid and strong fibril structure. A suitable wettability, which represents the favorable interaction between the oil and the nanoparticles, allows the nanoparticles to disperse evenly in the oil and prevents their aggregation, therefore making it easier to form a rigid and strong fibrillar structure under the electric field.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Liquids [M3+][A&#8722;]3 with Three&#8208;Valent Cations and Their Possible Use to Easily Separate Rare Earth Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkyl polyethylene oxide carboxylates allow for simple and safe synthesis of polyvalent ionic liquids with &#8216;naked&#8217; rare earth metals without the need of additional complexation. The direct interactions between the ions produce strong ion&#8208;specific properties despite the similarities between lanthanides. Proof of concept experiments highlight the feasibility of rare earth metal separation in liquid/liquid separation.







Abstract
We introduce a simple way to liquify rare earth metals (REM) by incorporating the corresponding cations, in particular Eu3+, La3+, and Y3+, into polyvalent ionic liquids (ILs). In contrast to conventional methods, this is achieved not by transforming them into anionic complexes, but by keeping them as bare cations and combining them with convenient, cheap and commercially available anions (A) in the form [REM3+][A&#8722;]3. To do so, we follow the COncept of Melting Point Lowering due to EThoxylation (COMPLET) with alkyl polyethylene oxide carboxylates as anions. We provide basic properties, such as glass transition temperatures, viscosities, electrical conductivities, as well as water&#8208;octanol partition constants P and show that these ILs have remarkably different properties, despite the similarity of their cations. In addition, we show that the ionic liquids possess interesting luminescent properties as non&#8208;conventional fluorophores.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;covalent interactions of heavy pnictogens with &#960;&#8208;arenes play a fundamental role in fields like crystal engineering or catalysis. The strength of such bonds is based on an interplay between dispersion and donor/acceptor interactions, and is generally attributed to the presence of &#960;&#8208;arenes. Computational studies of the interaction between the heavy pnictogens As, Sb and Bi and cyclohexane, in comparison with previous studies on the interaction between heavy pnictogens and benzene, show that this concept probably has to be revised. A thorough analysis of all the different energetic components that play a role in these systems, carried out with state of the art computational methods, sheds light on how they influence one another and the effect that their interplay has on the overall system. Furthermore, the analysis of such interactions leads us to the unexpected finding that the presence of the pnictogen compounds strongly affects the conformational equilibrium of cyclohexane, reversing the relative stability of the chair and boat&#8208;twist conformers, suggesting a possible application of tuneable dispersion energy donors to stabilize the desired conformation.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein phase separation process involving protein unfolding, misfolding, condensation and aggregation  etc.  has been associated with numerous human degenerative diseases. The complexity in protein conformational transitions results in multi&#8208;step and multi&#8208;species biochemical pathways upon protein phase separation. Recent progresses in designing novel fluorescent probes have unraveled the enriched details of phase separated proteins and provided mechanistic insights towards disease pathology. In this review, we summarized the design and characterizations of fluorescent probes that selectively illuminate proteins at different phase separated states with a focus on aggregation&#8208;induced emission probes, fluorescent molecular rotors, and solvatochromic fluorophores. Inspired by these pioneering works, a design blueprint was proposed to further develop fluorescent probes that can potentially shed light on the unresolved protein phase separated states in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Turning the Light on Phenols: New Opportunities in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phenols (  I  ) are extremely relevant chemical functionalities in natural, synthetic and industrial chemistry. Their corresponding electron&#8208;rich anions, namely phenolates (  I  ), are characterized by interesting physicochemical properties that can be drastically altered upon light excitation. Specifically, phenolates (  I  ) become strong reducing agents in the excited state and are able to generate reactive radicals from suitable precursors  via  single&#8208;electron transfer processes. Thus, these species can photochemically trigger strategic bond&#8208;forming reactions, including their direct aromatic C&#8208;H functionalization. Moreover, substituted phenolate anions can act as photocatalysts to enable synthetically useful organic transformations. An alternative mechanistic manifold is represented by the ability of phenolate derivatives  I  to form ground state electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes with electron&#8208;poor radical sources. These complementary scenarios have paved the way for the development of a wide range of relevant organic reactions. In this Minireview, we present the main examples of this research field, and give insight on emerging trends in phenols photocatalysis towards richer organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Rethinking Borole Cycloaddition Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 43, Page 11226-11233, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
New insights into the reactivity of perarylated boroles toward alkynes have been derived from both experimental and computational studies. It is shown that borepins (the formal alkyne insertion products) can readily isomerize to the thermodynamically more favorable boranorbornadienes (the formal Diels&#8208;Alder products), thus obscuring the mechanism of product formation (see Figure). In addition, the fluorescent nature of the tricyclic boracyclohexenes, the most stable isomers of the addition reactions, has been investigated by absorption and emission spectroscopy.







Abstract
Boroles are attracting broad interest for their myriad and diverse applications, including in synthesis, small molecule activation and functional materials. Their properties and reactivity are closely linked to the cyclic conjugated diene system, which has been shown to participate in cycloaddition reactions, such as the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with alkynes. The reaction steps leading to boranorbornadienes, borepins and tricyclic boracyclohexenes from the thermal reaction of boroles with alkynes are seemingly well understood as judged from the literature. Herein, we question the long&#8208;established mechanistic picture of pericyclic rearrangements by demonstrating that seven&#8208;membered borepins (i.&#8201;e., heptaphenylborepin and two derivatives substituted with a thienyl and chloride substituent on boron) exist in a dynamic equilibrium with the corresponding bicyclic boranorbornadienes, the direct Diels&#8208;Alder products, but are not isolable products from the reactions. Heating gradually converts the isomeric mixtures into fluorescent tricyclic boracyclohexenes, the most stable isomers in the series. Results from mechanistic DFT calculations reveal that the tricyclic compounds derive from the boranorbornadienes and not the borepins, which were previously believed to be intermediates in purely pericyclic processes.

         <title>Influence of Fine Ligand Substitution Modification of the Isocyanidometal Bridge on Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Charge Transfer Properties in Class II&#8211;III Mixed Valence Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 43, Page 11183-11194, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of new heterotrimetallic isocyanidometal&#8208;bridged complexes were synthesized and characterized. The experimental results show that the MMCT energy and the degree of electron delocalization of isocyanidometal&#8208;bridged mixed valence complexes can be tuned systematically by changing the auxiliary ligand on the bridging metal centre. The half&#8208;wave potential splitting between the terminal Fe centres in these three unoxidized complexes are the largest potential splitting for the cyanido&#8208;bridged complexes reported so far.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of Class II&#8211;III mixed valence complexes have been an interesting topic due to their special intermediate behaviour between localized and delocalized mixed valence complexes. To investigate the influence of the isocyanidometal bridge on metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (MMCT) properties, a family of new isocyanidometal&#8208;bridged complexes and their one&#8208;electron oxidation products cis&#8208;[Cp(dppe)Fe&#8722;CN&#8722;Ru(L)2&#8208;NC&#8722;Fe(dppe)Cp][PF6]n (n=2, 3) (Cp=1,3&#8208;cyclopentadiene, dppe=1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane, L=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy, 1[PF6]n), 5,5&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl (5,5&#8217;&#8208;dmbpy, 2[PF6]n) and 4,4&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl (4,4&#8217;&#8208;dmbpy, 3[PF6]n)) have been synthesized and fully characterized. The experimental results suggest that all the one&#8208;electron oxidation products may belong to Class II&#8211;III mixed valence complexes, supported by TDDFT calculations. With the change of the substituents of the bipyridyl ligand on the Ru centre from H, 5,5&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl to 4,4&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl, the energy of MMCT for the one&#8208;electron oxidation complexes changes in the order: 13+&lt;23+&lt;33+, and that for the two&#8208;electron oxidation complexes decreases in the order 14+&gt;34+&gt;24+. The potential splitting (&#916;E1/2(2)) between the two terminal Fe centres for N[PF6]2 are the largest potential splitting for the cyanido&#8208;bridged complexes reported so far. This work shows that the smaller potential difference between the bridging and the terminal metal centres would result in the more delocalized mixed valence complex.

N&#8208;terminal thiourea&#8208;modified helical l&#8208;Leu&#8208;based peptide (0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%) catalyzed a highly enantioselective 1,4&#8208;addition reaction between various &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes and dialkyl malonates to give 1,4&#8208;adducts with a 65&#8211;96&#8201;% ee. The length of the peptide chain, right&#8208;handed helical structure, amide N&#8722;Hs, and the N&#8208;terminal thiourea moiety played crucial roles in the asymmetric induction.







Abstract
N&#8208;terminal thiourea&#8208;modified l&#8208;Leu&#8208;based peptide {(3,5&#8208;diCF3Ph)NHC(=S)&#8208;(l&#8208;Leu&#8208;l&#8208;Leu&#8208;Ac5c)2&#8208;OMe} with five&#8208;membered ring &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted &#945;&#8208;amino acids (Ac5c) catalyzed a highly enantioselective 1,4&#8208;addition reaction between &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene and dimethyl malonate. The enantioselective reaction required only 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% chiral peptide&#8208;catalyst in the presence of iPr2EtN (2.5&#8197;equiv.), and gave a 1,4&#8208;adduct with 93&#8201;% ee of an 85&#8201;% yield. As Michael acceptors, various &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene derivatives such as methyl, p&#8208;fluoro, p&#8208;bromo, and p&#8208;methoxy substituents on the phenyl group, 2&#8208;furyl, 2&#8208;thiophenyl, and naphthyl &#946;&#8208;nitroethylenes could be applied. Furthermore, various alkyl malonates and cyclic &#946;&#8208;keto&#8208;esters could be used as Michael donors. It became clear that the length of the peptide chain, a right&#8208;handed helical structure, amide N&#8722;Hs, and the N&#8208;terminal thiourea moiety play crucial roles in asymmetric induction.

         <title>Self&#8208;assembly of Amphiphilic Porphyrins To Construct Nanoparticles for Highly Efficient Photodynamic Therapy</title>

Pull yourself together! Three photosensitizers with triphenylphosphine units and different lengths of ethylene glycol chains have been synthesized to improve amphiphilicity. Of the three photosensitizers, TPP&#8722;PPh3&#8722;4PEG is the most efficient (singlet oxygen yield: 0.89) for tumor photodynamic therapy not only because of its definite constituent, but also because its amphiphilic structure allows it to self&#8208;assemble in water.







Abstract
Hydrophobic photosensitizers greatly affect cell permeability and enrichment in tumors, but they cannot be used directly for clinical applications because they always aggregate in water, preventing their circulation in the blood and accumulation in tumor cells. As a result, amphiphilic photosensitizers are highly desirable. Although nanomaterial&#8208;based photosensitizers can solve water solubility, they have the disadvantages of complicated operation, poor reproducibility, low drug loading, and poor stability. In this work, an efficient synthesis strategy is proposed that converts small molecules into nanoparticles in 100&#8201;% aqueous solution by molecular assembly without the addition of any foreign species. Three photosensitizers with triphenylphosphine units and ethylene glycol chains of different lengths, TPP&#8722;PPh3, TPP&#8722;PPh3&#8722;2PEG and TPP&#8722;PPh3&#8722;4PEG, were synthesized to improve amphiphilicity. Of the three photosensitizers, TPP&#8722;PPh3&#8722;4PEG is the most efficient (singlet oxygen yield: 0.89) for tumor photodynamic therapy not only because of its definite constituent, but also because its amphiphilic structure allows it to self&#8208;assemble in water.

         <title>Mixed Dimensional Nanostructure (UiO&#8208;66&#8208;Decorated MWCNT) as a Nanofiller in Mixed&#8208;Matrix Membranes for Enhanced CO2/CH4 Separation</title>

The Schiff base strategy was exploited to produce mixed&#8208;dimensional nanostructures by coupling 3D UiO&#8208;66 and 1D MWCNT. The resultant MDN was used as nanofiller in mixed&#8208;matrix membranes to separate CO2 from CH4. The MMM containing 5.0&#8197;wt.&#8201;% UiO&#8208;66@MWCNT demonstrated a permeability for pure CO2 nearly twice that of a pure PSf membrane. The CO2/CH4 selectivity of this MMM was also better under similar conditions of pressure and temperature.







Abstract
Mixed&#8208;matrix membranes (MMMs) with combination of two distinct dimensional nanofillers (such as 1D&#8208;3D, 2D&#8208;3D, or 3D&#8208;3D, etc.) have drawn special attention for gas separation applications due to their concerted effects on gas permeation and mechanical properties. An amine&#8208;functionalized 1D multiwalled carbon nanotube (NH2&#8208;MWCNT) with exceptional mechanical strength and rapid gas transport was crosslinked with an amine&#8208;functionalized 3D metal&#8208;organic framework (UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2) with high CO2 affinity in a Schiff base reaction. The resultant crosslinked mixed&#8208;dimensional nanostructure was used as a nanofiller in a polysulfone (PSf) polymer matrix to explore the underlying synergy between 1D and 3D nanostructures on the gas separation performance of MMMs. Cross&#8208;sectional scanning electron microscopy and mapping revealed the homogenous dispersion of UiO&#8208;66@MWCNT in the polymer matrix. The MMM containing 5.0&#8197;wt.&#8201;% UiO&#8208;66@MWCNT demonstrated a superior permeability 8.3 Barrer as compared to the 4.2 Barrer of pure PSf membrane for CO2. Moreover, the selectivity (CO2/CH4) of this MMM was enhanced to 39.5 from the 28.0 observed for pure PSf under similar conditions of pressure and temperature.

More is better: The InBr3&#8208;catalysed transfer&#8208;hydrogenation from dihydroaromatic compounds to di&#8208; and trisubstituted alkenes was realised utilising cyclohexa&#8208;1,4&#8208;diene as H2 surrogate in chlorinated solvents, such as DCM and DCE. The scope of the reactions could be expanded towards electron&#8208;deficient aryl&#8208;substituted alkenes and even to a dialkyl&#8208;substituted alkene. The regiodivergent hydrodeuterogenation as well as the deuterohydrogenation were realised with two regiospecifically deuterium&#8208;labelled HD surrogates to access site selective deuterium incorporation in the products.







Abstract
The transfer&#8208;hydrogenation as well as the regioselective and regiodivergent addition of H&#8722;D from regiospecific deuterated dihydroaromatic compounds to a variety of 1,1&#8208;di&#8208; and trisubstituted alkenes was realised with InBr3 in dichloro(m)ethane. In comparison with the previously reported BF3&#8901;Et2O&#8208;catalysed process, electron&#8208;deficient aryl&#8208;substituents can be applied reliably and thereby several restrictions could be lifted, and new types of substrates could be transformed successfully in hydrodeuterogenation as well as deuterohydrogenation transfer&#8208;hydrogenation reactions.

Solar&#8208;driven photothermal antibacterial device was designed with multilayers based on IrO2 nanoaggregates&#8208;based photothermal and temperature sensor channels. The device can efficiently inactivate bacteria by monitoring the temperature accurately during the photothermal process. This study could provide valuable insight for development of solar&#8208;driven and self&#8208;feedback device for photothermal antibacterial materials.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven photothermal antibacterial devices have attracted a lot of interest due to the fact that solar energy is one of the cleanest sources of energy in the world. However, conventional materials have a narrow absorbance band, resulting in deficient solar harvesting. In addition, lack of knowledge on temperature change in these devices during the photothermal process has also led to a waste of energy. Here, we presented an elegant multi&#8208;channel optical device with a multilayer structure to simultaneously address the above&#8208;mentioned issues in solar&#8208;driven antibacterial devices. In the photothermal channel, semiconductor IrO2&#8208;nanoaggregates exhibited higher solar absorbance and photothermal conversion efficiency compared with nanoparticles. In the luminescence channel, thermal&#8208;sensitive Er&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles were utilized to reflect the microscale temperature in real&#8208;time. The bacteria were successfully inactivated during the photothermal effect under solar irradiation with temperature monitoring. This study could provide valuable insight for the development of smart photothermal devices for solar&#8208;driven photothermal bacterial inactivation in the future.

         <title>Systematic Access of Ternary Organotetrel&#8208;Copper Chalcogenide Clusters by [PhTE3]3&#8722; Anions (T=Si, Sn; E=S, Se)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 43, Page 11167-11174, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clusters of the type [(CuPPh2Ph)6(PhTE3)2] (T=Si, Sn; E=S, Se) and [(CuPPh3)6(PhSnSe3)3Cu3SnSe] were formed in reactions of Na3[PhTE3] with [Cu(PPh3)3Cl]. The larger cluster based on T/E=Sn/Se clearly followed upon partial degradation of the [PhSnSe3]3&#8722; subunit and exhibited a new cluster archetype with idealized C3v symmetry. Quantum chemical studies served to shed light on the bonding situation in these clusters and to rationalize the optical absorption properties measured by solid&#8208;state UV/Vis absorption spectra.







Abstract
Fragmentation reactions of organotetrel chalcogenide heteroadamantane&#8208;type clusters [(PhT)4E6] (T/E=Si/S (1); Si/Se; Sn/S, and Sn/Se) by addition of the corresponding sodium chalcogenide gave salts of the general formula Na3[PhTE3], with T/E=Si/S (2); Si/Se (3); Sn/S (A); Sn/Se (4). Reaction of these salts with [Cu(PPh3)3Cl] gave a series of organotetrel&#8211;copper chalcogenide clusters [(CuPPh3)6(PhTE3)2] with T/E=Si/S; (5), Si/Se (6), Sn/S (7) and Sn/Se (8). Compounds 5&#8211;8 share a common structural motif with two intact {PhTE3} units coordinating a Cu6 moiety, which was previously reported with other ligands, and for the Sn and Ge congeners only. If the Sn/Se reaction system was allowed to crystallize more slowly, single crystals of compound [(CuPPh3)6(PhSnSe3)3Cu3SnSe] (9) were obtained, which are based on a larger cluster structure. Hence, 9 might form from 8 through incorporation of additional cluster fragments. The experimentally and quantum chemically determined optical properties were compared to related clusters.

         <title>Applying Unconventional Spectroscopies to the Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets, Co(PPh3)2X2 (X=Cl, Br, I): Unveiling Magnetic Transitions and Spin&#8208;Phonon Coupling</title>

Direct determination of magnetic excited levels and spin&#8208;phonon couplings in the compounds in three SMMs, leading to magnetic relaxation, has been achieved by the combined use of inelastic neutron scattering (INS), far&#8208;IR magnetic spectroscopy (FIRMS), high&#8208;frequency and &#8208;field EPR, frequency&#8208;domain FT terahertz EPR, ligand&#8208;field theory (LFT) analysis, and DFT calculations of phonons (i.&#8201;e., both molecular and lattice vibrations). Calculated spin densities on Co(II) ions correlate with magnetic separations in the compounds.







Abstract
Large separation of magnetic levels and slow relaxation in metal complexes are desirable properties of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). Spin&#8208;phonon coupling (interactions of magnetic levels with phonons) is ubiquitous, leading to magnetic relaxation and loss of memory in SMMs and quantum coherence in qubits. Direct observation of magnetic transitions and spin&#8208;phonon coupling in molecules is challenging. We have found that far&#8208;IR magnetic spectra (FIRMS) of Co(PPh3)2X2 (Co&#8208;X; X=Cl, Br, I) reveal rarely observed spin&#8208;phonon coupling as avoided crossings between magnetic and u&#8208;symmetry phonon transitions. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) gives phonon spectra. Calculations using VASP and phonopy programs gave phonon symmetries and movies. Magnetic transitions among zero&#8208;field split (ZFS) levels of the S=3/2 electronic ground state were probed by INS, high&#8208;frequency and &#8208;field EPR (HFEPR), FIRMS, and frequency&#8208;domain FT terahertz EPR (FD&#8208;FT THz&#8208;EPR), giving magnetic excitation spectra and determining ZFS parameters (D, E) and g values. Ligand&#8208;field theory (LFT) was used to analyze earlier electronic absorption spectra and give calculated ZFS parameters matching those from the experiments. DFT calculations also gave spin densities in Co&#8208;X, showing that the larger Co(II) spin density in a molecule, the larger its ZFS magnitude. The current work reveals dynamics of magnetic and phonon excitations in SMMs. Studies of such couplings in the future would help to understand how spin&#8208;phonon coupling may lead to magnetic relaxation and develop guidance to control such coupling.

         <title>Artificial Supramolecular Pumps Powered by Light</title>

         <dc:description>
The appropriate integration of molecular recognition and photoswitching phenomena in rotaxane&#8208;type complexes can lead to the realization of artificial supramolecular pumps driven by light. We describe the operation mechanisms of these systems, based on a flashing energy ratchet, is described, and their ability to function autonomously by dissipating light energy away from chemical equilibrium is reported.







Abstract
The development of artificial nanoscale motors that can use energy from a source to perform tasks requires systems capable of performing directionally controlled molecular movements and operating away from chemical equilibrium. Here, the design, synthesis and properties of pseudorotaxanes are described, in which a photon input triggers the unidirectional motion of a macrocyclic ring with respect to a non&#8208;symmetric molecular axle. The photoinduced energy ratcheting at the basis of the pumping mechanism is validated by measuring the relevant thermodynamic and kinetic parameters. Owing to the photochemical behavior of the azobenzene moiety embedded in the axle, the pump can repeat its operation cycle autonomously under continuous illumination. NMR spectroscopy was used to observe the dissipative non&#8208;equilibrium state generated in&#8197;situ by light irradiation. We also show that fine changes in the axle structure lead to an improvement in the performance of the motor. Such results highlight the modularity and versatility of this minimalist pump design, which provides facile access to dynamic systems that operate under photoinduced non&#8208;equilibrium regimes.

The photoinduced energy ratcheting at the basis of the pumping mechanism is validated by measuring the relevant thermodynamic and kinetic parameters. Owing to the photochemical behavior of the azobenzene moiety embedded in the axle, the pump can repeat its operation cycle autonomously under continuous illumination. NMR spectroscopy was used to observe the dissipative non-equilibrium state generated in&#8197;situ by light irradiation. We also show that fine changes in the axle structure lead to an improvement in the performance of the motor. Such results highlight the modularity and versatility of this minimalist pump design, which provides facile access to dynamic systems that operate under photoinduced non-equilibrium regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Organic Polysulfides from Disulfides by Sulfur Insertion from S8 and an Unexpected Solvent Effect on the Product Distribution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 43, Page 11141-11149, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrifying Sulfur! The electrolysis of organic disulfides in dichloromethane led to the formation of organic polysulfides with a high incorporation of additional sulfur atoms. HPLC/HRMS analysis of the reaction mixture could identify products up to undecasulfides. When CS2 was used as co&#8208;solvent the distribution of the organic polysulfide mixture was altered in favor of the lower polysulfides, such as tri&#8208; and tetrasulfides.







Abstract
An electrochemical synthesis of organic polysulfides through sulfur insertion from elemental sulfur to disulfides or thiols is introduced. The highly economic, low&#8208;sensitive and low&#8208;priced reaction gives a mixture of polysulfides, whose distribution can be influenced by the addition of different amounts of carbon disulfide as co&#8208;solvent. To describe the variable distribution function of the polysulfides, a novel parameter, the &#8220;absorbance average sulfur amount in polysulfides&#8221; (SAP) was introduced and defined on the basis of the &#8220;number average molar mass&#8221; used in polymer chemistry. Various organic polysulfides were synthesized with variable volume fractions of carbon disulfide, and the yield of each polysulfide was determined by quantitative 13C NMR. Moreover, by using two symmetrical disulfides or a disulfide and a thiol as starting materials, a mixture of symmetrical and asymmetrical polysulfides could be obtained.

         <title>Rapid Aqueous Synthesis of Large&#8208;Size and Edge/Defect&#8208;Rich Porous Pd and Pd&#8208;Alloyed Nanomesh for Electrocatalytic Ethanol Oxidation</title>

A facile and rapid aqueous synthesis of Pd and Pd&#8208;alloyed porous nanomeshes (PNMs) with multiple structural advantages like ultrathinness, large&#8208;size, porosity, edge/defect richness, and being ligand&#8208;free results in more catalytically active sites and high atomic efficiency. Synergic structural and compositional enhancement effects enhanced the mass activity, anti&#8208;poisoning ability, and stability/durability in electrocatalytic EOR of PNM Pd87Cu13 compared to PdCu PNMs with other elemental ratios, Pd PNMs, and Pd NPs.







Abstract
In this work, a facile aqueous synthesis strategy was used (complete in 5&#8197;min at room temperature) to produce large&#8208;size Pd, PdCu, and PdPtCu nanomeshes without additional organic ligands or solvent and the volume restriction of reaction solution. The obtained metallic nanomeshes possess graphene&#8208;like morphology and a large size of dozens of microns. Abundant edges (coordinatively unsaturated sites, steps, and corners), defects (twins), and mesopores are seen in the metallic ultrathin structures. The formation mechanism for porous Pd nanomeshes disclosed that they undergo oriented attachment growth along the &#10216;111&#10217; direction. Owing to structural and compositional advantages, PdCu porous nanomeshes with certain elemental ratios (e.&#8201;g., Pd87Cu13) presented enhanced electrocatalytic performance (larger mass activity, better CO tolerance and stability) toward ethanol oxidation.

         <title>Tetrasubstituted Peropyrenes Formed by Reductive Aromatization: Synthesis, Functionalization and Characterization</title>

1,3,8,10&#8208;Tetrasubstituted peropyrenes were synthesized via a reductive aromatization and functionalization strategy. Finetuning of their optoelectronic properties was monitored by UV&#8208;Vis, PL, XRD, CV, and DFT methods.







Abstract
The chromophore class of 1,3,8,10&#8208;tetrasubstituted peropyrenes was effectively synthesized from peropyrenequinone via a Zn&#8208;mediated reductive aromatization approach. In one step, a symmetric functionalization of the peropyrene backbone introducing silylethers (2,3), pivaloyl (4), triflyl (5) and also phosphinite (6) groups was established. Furthermore, the potential of using 4 and 5 in transition metal catalysed cross couplings was explored leading to 1,3,8,10&#8208;tetraaryl (8&#8208;11) and tetraalkynyl (7) peropyrenes. The influence of various substituents on the optoelectronic properties of these &#960;&#8208;system extended peropyrenes was investigated in solid state by means of X&#8208;ray crystallography, in solution by means of UV&#8208;Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and by their redox properties studied via cyclic voltammetry. By comparison with DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations, it could be elucidated that introduction of a broad variety of substituents in such versatile one or two step procedures leads to peropyrenes with easily tunable HOMO and LUMO energies ranging in a gap window of 0.8 eV. The frontier molecular orbital energies identify the target molecules as promising candidates for hole transporting semiconductors.

PCN&#8208;244&#8722;ZnCo1 was successfully synthesized and then pyrolyzed to the target product PCN&#8208;224&#8722;ZnCo1&#8208;950 at 950&#8201;&#176;C. The physical structure of PCN&#8208;224&#8722;ZnCo1&#8208;950 did not change much, as judged by SEM and N2 adsorption and desorption. Due to the volatilization of Zn, PCN&#8208;224&#8722;ZnCo1&#8208;950 has greatly improved basicity and suitable acidic/alkaline site concentration compared to the precursor. It can be efficiently used to carbon dioxide absorption and catalyze the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) is an ideal precursor/template for porous carbon, and its active components are uniformly doped, which can be used in energy storage and catalytic conversion fields. Metal&#8208;organic framework PCN&#8208;224 with carboxylporphyrin as the ligand was synthesized, and then Zn2+ and Co2+ ions were coordinated in the center of the porphyrin ring by post&#8208;modification. Here, PCN&#8208;224&#8722;ZnCo with different ratios of bimetallic Zn2+/Co2+ ions were used as the precursor, and the metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon(M&#8722;N&#8722;C) material of PCN&#8208;224&#8722;ZnCo&#8208;950 was obtained by pyrolyzing the precursor at 950&#8201;&#176;C in Ar. Because Zn is easy to volatilize at 950&#8201;&#176;C, the formed M&#8722;N&#8722;C materials can reflect different Co contents and different basic site concentrations. The formed material still maintains the original basic framework. With the increase of Zn2+/Co2+ ratio in precursor, the concentration of N&#8208;containing alkaline sites in pyrolysis products gradually increase. Compared with the precursor, PCN&#8208;224&#8722;ZnCo1&#8208;950 with Zn2+/Co2+=1&#8201;:&#8201;1 has greatly improved basicity and suitable acidic/ alkaline site concentration. It can be efficiently used to carbon dioxide absorption and catalyze the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxide. More importantly, the current method of adjusting the acidic/basic sites in M&#8722;N&#8722;C materials through volatilization of volatile metals can provide an effective strategy for adjusting the catalysis of MOF derivatives with porphyrin structure.

Compared with the precursor, PCN-224&#8722;ZnCo&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-950 with Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;=1&#8201;:&#8201;1 has greatly improved basicity and suitable acidic/ alkaline site concentration. It can be efficiently used to carbon dioxide absorption and catalyze the cycloaddition of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with epoxide. More importantly, the current method of adjusting the acidic/basic sites in M&#8722;N&#8722;C materials through volatilization of volatile metals can provide an effective strategy for adjusting the catalysis of MOF derivatives with porphyrin structure.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Accessing Improbable Foldamer Shapes with Strained Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 43, Page 11205-11215, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Frustrating folding propensity by imposing a macrocyclic structure to an otherwise helical backbone produces improbable yet stable strained molecular shapes. Both experiments and computational studies show how aromatic oligoamide foldamers constrained within a macrocycle try to fulfill their strong propensity to adopt helical conformations by forming local loops and unfolded sites that connect helical segments. Defined fluxional conformational pathways can be evidenced in such molecules.







Abstract
The alkylation of some secondary amide functions with a dimethoxybenzyl (DMB) group in oligomers of 8&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;quinolinecarboxylic acid destabilizes the otherwise favored helical conformations, and allows for cyclization to take place. A cyclic hexamer and a cyclic heptamer were produced in this manner. After DMB removal, X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR show that the macrocycles adopt strained conformations that would be improbable in noncyclic species. The high helix folding propensity of the main chain is partly expressed in these conformations, but it remains frustrated by macrocyclization. Despite being homomeric, the macrocycles possess inequivalent monomer units. Experimental and computational studies highlight specific fluxional pathways within these structures. Extensive simulated annealing molecular dynamics allow for the prediction of the conformations for larger macrocycles with up to sixteen monomers.

         <title>The Stronger the Better: Donor Substituents Push Catalytic Activity of Molecular Chromium Olefin Polymerization Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 43, Page 11084-11093, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic activity in ethylene polymerization with single&#8208;site organochromium complexes increases with number and donor strength of substituents. The new systems allow the formation of ultra&#8208;high molecular weight polyethylene with highest productivity and high co&#8208;monomer incorporation. An almost linear correlation between ligand donor strength and polymerization activity is observed.







Abstract
The donor strength of bifunctional pyridine&#8208;cyclopentadienyl ligands was altered systematically by the introduction of donating groups in the para&#8208;position of the pyridine. In the resulting chromium complexes an almost linear correlation between donor strength and the nitrogen&#8208;chromium distance as well as the electronic absorption maximum is experimentally observed. The connection of electron&#8208;donating groups in the ligand backbone leads to an efficient transfer of the electronic influences to the catalytically active metal centre without restricting it through steric effects. Therefore, catalytic olefin polymerization activity, which is already very high for the previously studied catalysts, increase considerably by attaching para&#8208;amino groups to the chelating pyridine or quinoline, respectively. Combining electron&#8208;rich indenyl ligands with para&#8208;amino substituted pyridines lead to the highest catalytic activities observed so far for this class of organo chromium olefin polymerisation catalysts. The resulting polymers are of ultra&#8208;high molecular weight and the ability of the catalysts to incorporate co&#8208;monomers is also very high.

         <title>Re&#8208;entrant Photoinduced Morphological Transformation and Temperature&#8208;Dependent Kinetic Products of a Rectangular Amphiphilic Diarylethene Assembly</title>

Different temperature, different assembly: An amphiphilic rectangular&#8208;shaped photochromic diarylethene showed photoinduced morphological transformation upon irradiation with UV and visible light in water. A re&#8208;entrant transformation was observed, which was interpreted by the V&#8208;shaped phase diagram of the LCST transition. Moreover, by changing the cooling temperature, different kinetic products of supramolecular assembly were obtained.







Abstract
An amphiphilic rectangular&#8208;shaped photochromic diarylethene bearing two hydrophobic alkyl chains and two hydrophilic tri(ethylene glycol) chains was synthesized, and its photoinduced morphological transformation in water was investigated. Two unexpected phenomena were revealed in the course of the experiments: a re&#8208;entrant photoinduced macroscopic morphological transformation and temperature&#8208;dependent kinetic products of supramolecular assembly. When the pure closed&#8208;ring isomer was dispersed in water, a re&#8208;entrant photoinduced morphological transformation, that is, a photoinduced transition from the hydrated phase to the dehydrated phase and then back to the hydrated phase, was observed by optical microscopy upon irradiation with green light at 20&#8201;&#176;C; this was interpreted by the V&#8208;shaped phase diagram of the LCST transition. The aqueous assembly of the pure closed&#8208;ring isomer was controlled by changing the temperature; specifically, rapid cooling to 15 and 5&#8201;&#176;C gave J and H aggregates, respectively, as the kinetic products. The thermodynamic product at both temperatures was a mixture of mostly H aggregate with a small amount of J aggregate. This behavior was rationalized by the temperature&#8208;dependent potential energy surface of the supramolecular assembly.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of the Putative Biosynthetic Intermediate Ambruticin&#8197;J</title>

First total synthesis: A putative intermediate in ambruticin biosynthesis was prepared by a convergent route using a trisubstituted cyclopropyl linchpin. The stereochemical assignment has been confirmed and incorrect spectral data have been updated. Access to this material will enable studies of the post&#8208;PKS processing that leads to ambruticin structures and aid greater understanding of their potent anti&#8208;fungal activity.







Abstract
The family of anti&#8208;fungal natural products known as the ambruticins are structurally distinguished by a pair of pyran rings adorning a divinylcyclopropane core. Previous characterization of their biosynthesis, including the expression of a genetically modified producing organism, revealed that the polyketide synthase pathway proceeds via a diol intermediate, known as ambruticin&#8197;J. Herein, we report the first enantioselective total synthesis of the putative PKS product, ambruticin&#8197;J, according to a triply convergent synthetic route featuring a Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling and a Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefination for fragment assembly. This synthesis takes advantage of synthetic methodology previously developed by our laboratory for the stereoselective generation of the trisubstituted cyclopropyl linchpin.

         <title>Hierarchical Architectures Based on Ru Nanoparticles/Oxygen&#8208;Rich&#8208;Carbon Nanotubes for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 43, Page 11150-11157, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen at high or low pH: Hierarchical oxygen&#8208;rich carbon nanotube architectures strongly trap Ru nanoparticles, and a Ru&#8722;O&#8722;C bond is formed from the strong interaction at Ru/OCNT interfaces. The obtained catalyst shows excellent catalytic activity and stability for the HER in both alkaline and acid electrolytes, and the high activity of the catalyst is further confirmed by density functional theory.







Abstract
Highly active and durable electrocatalysts are essential for producing hydrogen fuel through the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, a uniform deposition of Ru nanoparticles strongly interacting with oxygen&#8208;rich carbon nanotube architectures (Ru&#8208;OCNT) through ozonation and hydrothermal approaches has been designed. The hierarchical structure of Ru&#8208;OCNT is made by self&#8208;assembly of oxygen functionalities of OCNT. Ru nanoparticles interact strongly with OCNT at the Ru/OCNT interface to give excellent catalytic activity and stability of the Ru&#8208;OCNT, as further confirmed by density functional theory.

The smaller Tafel slope of Ru&#8208;OCNT than Ru&#8208;CNT and commercial Pt/C in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes indicates high catalytic activity and fast charge transfer kinetics. The as&#8208;proposed chemistry provides the rational design of hierarchically structured CNT/nanoparticle electrocatalysts for HER to produce hydrogen fuel.

     alt="Hierarchical Architectures Based on Ru Nanoparticles/Oxygen-Rich-Carbon Nanotubes for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hydrogen at high or low pH&lt;/b&gt;: Hierarchical oxygen-rich carbon nanotube architectures strongly trap Ru nanoparticles, and a Ru&#8722;O&#8722;C bond is formed from the strong interaction at Ru/OCNT interfaces. The obtained catalyst shows excellent catalytic activity and stability for the HER in both alkaline and acid electrolytes, and the high activity of the catalyst is further confirmed by density functional theory.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly active and durable electrocatalysts are essential for producing hydrogen fuel through the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, a uniform deposition of Ru nanoparticles strongly interacting with oxygen-rich carbon nanotube architectures (Ru-OCNT) through ozonation and hydrothermal approaches has been designed. The hierarchical structure of Ru-OCNT is made by self-assembly of oxygen functionalities of OCNT. Ru nanoparticles interact strongly with OCNT at the Ru/OCNT interface to give excellent catalytic activity and stability of the Ru-OCNT, as further confirmed by density functional theory. Owing to the hierarchical structure and adjusted surface chemistry, Ru-OCNT has an overpotential of 34&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a Tafel slope of 27.8&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in 1&#8197;M KOH, and an overpotential of 55&#8197;mV with Tafel slope of 33&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in 0.5&#8197;M H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The smaller Tafel slope of Ru-OCNT than Ru-CNT and commercial Pt/C in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes indicates high catalytic activity and fast charge transfer kinetics. The as-proposed chemistry provides the rational design of hierarchically structured CNT/nanoparticle electrocatalysts for HER to produce hydrogen fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

Light&#8208;driven supramolecular pumping was achieved, as a result of unidirectional threading and dethreading movements, by combining photoisomerization and self&#8208;assembly processes in a closed reaction network (represented by reservoirs and pipes in the cover image). While light irradiation (bulb and gears) pushes the species energetically uphill, subsequent exergonic reactions (falling water) convert energy into motion, and a continuous and directional transfer along the cycle (the water flow) is observed at the photostationary state.

Chromium based single&#8208;site catalysts allow the production of ultra&#8208;high molecular weight polyethylene with very high productivities. The picture shows a donor&#8208;functionalised indenyl chromium catalyst in action where a strong electron&#8208;donating substituent leads to an increase in catalytic activity and co&#8208;monomer incorporation. The correlation between donor strength, electronic and catalytic properties was studied systematically. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M. Enders et&#8197;al.

The tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanol, Si(C2F5)3OH, flashes out of the shadows of silanol derivatives in the cover image, paving the way to its disiloxane and disilanolate. Oxidation of tris(pentafluoroethyl)silane, Si(C2F5)3H, with NO2 provides Si(C2F5)3OH, which readily condenses to disiloxane (C2F5)3SiOSi(C2F5)3. Deprotonation of in situ generated Si(C2F5)3OH yields disilanolate [{Si(C2F5)3O}2]2&#8722; underlining the formally Lewis amphoteric character of the monomeric tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanolate, [Si(C2F5)3O]&#8722;.

         <title>Dual Plasmonic Au&#8722;Cu2&#8722;xS Nanocomposites: Design Strategies and Photothermal Properties</title>

Hot metals: Au&#8208;Cu2&#8722;xS nanocomposites are a promising class of plasmonic nanomaterials that can be rationally designed to achieve strong light absorption and high photothermal conversion efficiency. In this Minireview, we show the different hybrid configurations that are possible for Au&#8722;Cu2&#8722;xS nanocomposites, present various synthetic strategies for their fabrication, and discuss their tunable plasmon&#8208;induced absorption features and photothermal properties. We also demonstrate their potential use in photothermal therapy and in the blossoming field of theranostics.







Abstract
Coupling two different materials to create a hybrid nanostructured system is a powerful strategy for achieving synergistically enhanced properties and advanced functionalities. In the case of Au and Cu2&#8722;xS, their combination on the nanoscale results in dual plasmonic Au&#8722;Cu2&#8722;xS nanocomposites that exhibit intense photon absorption in both the visible and the near&#8208;infrared spectral ranges. Their strong light&#8208;absorbing properties translate to superior photothermal transduction efficiency, making them attractive in photothermal&#8208;based applications. There are several nanostructure configurations that are possible for the Au&#8722;Cu2&#8722;xS system, and the successful fabrication of a particular architecture often requires a carefully planned synthetic strategy. In this Minireview, the different synthetic approaches that can be employed to produce rationally designed Au&#8722;Cu2&#8722;xS nanocomposites are presented, with a focus on the experimental protocols that can lead to heterodimer, core&#8211;shell, reverse core&#8211;shell, and yolk&#8211;shell configurations. The photothermal behavior of these materials is also discussed, providing a glimpse of their potential use as photothermally active agents in therapeutic and theranostic applications.

A fluoride&#8208;promoted, stepwise nucleophilic aromatic substitution of silicon&#8208;based aryl pronucleophiles decorated with sensitive functional groups and polyfluorinated arenes enables the synthesis of partially fluorinated biaryls. The mild transformation operates at room temperature, requiring less than one hour for completion. Hence, the functional&#8208;group compatibility is superb, and regioselectivities are improved compared to known couplings.







Abstract
A chemoselective C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2) coupling of sufficiently electron&#8208;deficient fluorinated arenes and functionalized N&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8217;&#8208;silyldiazenes as masked aryl nucleophiles is reported. The fluoride&#8208;promoted transformation involves the in&#8197;situ generation of the aryl nucleophile decorated with various sensitive functional groups followed by a stepwise nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr). These reactions typically proceed at room temperature within minutes. This catalytic process allows for the functionalization of both coupling partners, furnishing highly fluorinated biaryls in good yields.

         <title>Unveiling Polymerization Mechanism in pH&#8208;regulated Supramolecular Fibers in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 43, Page 11056-11060, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and self&#8208;assembly in aqueous media of an amine functionalized C3&#8208;symmetric benzotrithiophene is reported. A dramatic change in the polymerization mechanism and size of the supramolecular fibers is observed upon modifying the pH, which is further employed to finely control the one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymerization and copolymerization processes.







Abstract
An amine functionalized C3&#8208;symmetric benzotrithiophene (BTT) monomer has been designed and synthetized in order to form pH responsive one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymers in aqueous media. While most of the reported studies looked at the effect of pH on the size of the aggregates, herein, a detailed mechanistic study is reported, carried out upon modifying the pH to trigger the formation of positively charged ammonium groups. A dramatic and reversible change in the polymerization mechanism and size of the supramolecular fibers is observed and ascribed to the combination of Coulombic repulsive forces and higher monomer solubility. Furthermore, the induced frustrated growth of the fibers is further employed to finely control the one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymerisation and copolymerization processes.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The synthesis&lt;/b&gt; and self-assembly in aqueous media of an amine functionalized C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric benzotrithiophene is reported. A dramatic change in the polymerization mechanism and size of the supramolecular fibers is observed upon modifying the pH, which is further employed to finely control the one-dimensional supramolecular polymerization and copolymerization processes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An amine functionalized C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric benzotrithiophene (BTT) monomer has been designed and synthetized in order to form pH responsive one-dimensional supramolecular polymers in aqueous media. While most of the reported studies looked at the effect of pH on the size of the aggregates, herein, a detailed mechanistic study is reported, carried out upon modifying the pH to trigger the formation of positively charged ammonium groups. A dramatic and reversible change in the polymerization mechanism and size of the supramolecular fibers is observed and ascribed to the combination of Coulombic repulsive forces and higher monomer solubility. Furthermore, the induced frustrated growth of the fibers is further employed to finely control the one-dimensional supramolecular polymerisation and copolymerization processes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanol Derivatives and the Lewis Amphoteric Tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanolate Anion, [Si(C2F5)3O]&#8722;</title>

         <dc:description>
As perfluoroalkyl siloxanes and their congener species are virtually unknown, the oxidation of tris(pentafluoroethyl)silane, Si(C2F5)3H, with NO2 yielding tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanol 1 which readily condenses to hexakis(pentafluoroethyl)disiloxane is reported. Deprotonation of in&#8197;situ generated Si(C2F5)3OH leads to hexakis(pentafluoroethyl)disilanolate 3 showing the Lewis amphoteric character of [Si(C2F5)3O]&#8722;.







Abstract
While alkyl&#8208;substituted siloxanes are widely known, virtually nothing is known about perfluoroalkyl siloxanes and their congener species, the silanols and silanolates. We recently reported on the tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanide ion, [Si(C2F5)3]&#8722;, which features Lewis amphoteric character deriving from the pentafluoroethyl substituents and their strong electron&#8208;withdrawing properties. Transferring this knowledge, we investigated the Lewis amphoteric behavior of the tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanolate, [Si(C2F5)3O]&#8722;. In order to examine such Lewis amphoteric behavior, we first developed a strategy for the synthesis of the corresponding silanol Si(C2F5)3OH, which readily condenses at room temperature to the hexakis(pentafluoroethyl)disiloxane, (C2F5)3SiOSi(C2F5)3. Deprotonation of Si(C2F5)3OH employing a sterically demanding phosphazene base allows the characterization of the first example of a dimeric triorganosilanolate: the dianionic hexakis(pentafluoroethyl)disilanolate, [{Si(C2F5)3O}2]2&#8722;, implies Lewis amphoteric character of the monomeric [Si(C2F5)3O]&#8722; anion.

         <title>Establishing a &#8220;Ring&#8208;Size&#8208;Divergent&#8221; Synthetic Strategy: Synthesis, Structural Revision, and Absolute Configuration of Feroniellins</title>

Running rings around ethers: A &#8220;ring&#8208;size&#8208;divergent&#8221; strategy enabled us to divergently synthesize the five&#8208;, six&#8208;, and seven&#8208;membered ether rings of feroniellin analogs from diepoxides under simple acidic or neutral conditions in only two steps from bergamottin. Additionally, the proposed structures of feroniellins A and B were revised, and the absolute configurations of all feroniellins were determined from their asymmetric synthesis.







Abstract
Feroniellin analogs isolated from Feroniella lucida possess a furanocoumarin skeleton connected to monoterpenic five&#8208; to seven&#8208;membered ethereal rings by an ether linkage and exhibit a broad spectrum of biological activities. In this contribution, we intended to establish a &#8220;ring&#8208;size&#8208;divergent&#8221; synthetic strategy for the monoterpenic five&#8208; to seven&#8208;membered ethereal rings through the chemical sythesis of feroniellins. The short and comprehensive synthesis of feroniellins was achieved in only two steps from easily available bergamottin based on the &#8220;ring&#8208;size&#8208;divergent&#8221; strategy. In addition, these syntheses resulted in revision of the proposed structures for feroniellins A and B and the determination of all the absolute configurations of feroniellins; their preliminary anti&#8208;inflammatory activities were investigated as well.

         <title>Charge Transfer Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Containing Redox&#8208;Active TTF/NDI Units for Highly Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Photothermal Conversion</title>

The heat is on: A charge&#8208;transfer MOF based on redox&#8208;active TTF/NDI units has been prepared and structurally characterized. Due to the efficient charge&#8208;transfer absorption in the NIR region, the MOF shows excellent photothermal conversion performance. Co&#8208;MOF@PDMS composite films have been studied and could be new candidates for stable and processable materials in photothermal therapy.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), as a class of new inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid crystal materials, could have important applications in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal conversion. Herein, a new charge&#8208;transfer MOF (Co&#8208;MOF) with mixed ligands of H4TTFTB and bpmNDI incorporating redox&#8208;active tetrathiafulvalene/naphthalene diimide (TTF/NDI) units into one system is reported. Due to the presence of TTF/NDI oxidative and reductive couples, stable radicals can be observed in the MOF. In addition, charge transfer from the electron donor (TTF) to the acceptor (NDI) results in a broad absorption in the NIR region. The Co&#8208;MOF exhibited an efficient photothermal effect induced by irradiation with a NIR laser. Under the 808&#8197;nm laser (0.7&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) illumination, the temperature of the Co&#8208;MOF increased from room temperature to 201&#8201;&#176;C in only 10&#8197;s. Furthermore, a series of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films doped with trace amounts of Co&#8208;MOF showed efficient NIR photothermal conversion. When a Co&#8208;MOF@PDMS (0.6&#8197;wt&#8201;%) film is irradiated by 808&#8197;nm laser with power of 0.5&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2, it&#8242;s temperature can reach a plateau at 62&#8201;&#176;C from 20&#8201;&#176;C within 100&#8197;s. Our experimental results from the Co&#8208;MOF@PDMS film demonstrate that the effectiveness and feasibility of the material is promising for photothermal applications.

&#8220;We present an improved version of a rotaxane&#8208;based system in which unidirectional threading and dethreading of the molecular components can be carried out repeatedly under stationary optical excitation in solution. By performing the photoreaction in the probe of the NMR spectrometer, we were able to investigate the photoinduced non&#8208;equilibrium behavior of the system, and in particular distinguish between kinetically trapped and stationary dissipative regimes.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;11076&#8197;ff.

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;&lt;i&gt;We present an improved version of a rotaxane-based system in which unidirectional threading and dethreading of the molecular components can be carried out repeatedly under stationary optical excitation in solution. By performing the photoreaction in the probe of the NMR spectrometer, we were able to investigate the photoinduced non-equilibrium behavior of the system, and in particular distinguish between kinetically trapped and stationary dissipative regimes&lt;/i&gt;.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;11076&#8197;ff.

         <title>Self&#8208;Propelling Hybrid Gels Incorporating an Active Self&#8208;Assembled Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Gelator</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid gel beads based on combining a low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator (LMWG) with a polymer gelator (PG) demonstrate enhanced ability to self&#8208;propel in water, with the LMWG playing an active role. Hybrid gel beads were loaded with ethanol and shown to move in water via &#8216;Marangoni effect&#8217; surface tension changes caused by the expulsion of ethanol &#8211; smaller beads move further and faster than larger beads. Flat shapes of the hybrid gel were cut using a &#8216;stamp&#8217; &#8211; circles moved the furthest while stars showed more rotational movement on their own axis. Comparing hybrid LMWG/PG gel beads with PG&#8208;only beads demonstrated that the LMWG speeds up the beads, enhancing the rate of self&#8208;propulsion. Self&#8208;assembly of the LMWG into a &#8216;solid&#8208;like&#8217; network prevents its leaching from the gel. The LMWG also retains its own unique function &#8211; specifically, remediating methylene blue pollutant dye from basic water as a result of non&#8208;covalent interactions. The mobile hybrid beads accumulate this dye more effectively than PG&#8208;only beads. Self&#8208;propelling gel beads have potential applications in removal/delivery of active agents in environmental or biological settings. The ability of self&#8208;assembling LMWGs to enhance mobility and control removal/delivery, suggests that adding them into self&#8208;propelling systems can add significant value.</dc:description>

         <title>The influence of secondary interactions on the [N&#8208;I&#8208;N]+ halogen bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>[Bis(pyridine)iodine(I)]  +  complexes offer controlled access to halonium ions under mild conditions. The reactivity of such stabilized halonium ions is primarily determined by their three&#8208;center, four&#8208;electron [N&#8208;I&#8208;N]  +  halogen bond. We studied the importance of chelation, strain, steric hindrance and electrostatic interaction for the structure and reactivity of halogen bonded halonium ions by acquiring their  15  N NMR coordination shifts and measuring their iodenium release rates, and interpreted the data with the support of DFT computations. A bidentate ligand stabilizes the [N&#8208;I&#8208;N]  +  halogen bond, decreasing the halenium transfer rate. Strain weakens the bond and accordingly increases the release rate. Remote modifications in the backbone do not influence the stability as long as the effect is entirely steric. Incorporating an electron&#8208;rich moiety close by the [N&#8208;I&#8208;N]  +  motif increases the iodenium release rate. The analysis of the iodine(I) transfer mechanism highlights the impact of secondary interactions, and may provide a handle on the induction of stereoselectivity in electrophilic halogenations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The reactivity of iron nanocluster arrays on  h&#8208;  BN/Rh(111) was studied using  in situ  high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The morphology and reactivity of the iron nanoclusters (Fe&#8208; NCs) were investigated by CO adsorption. On&#8208;top and hollow/edge sites were determined to be the available adsorption sites on the as&#8208;prepared Fe&#8208;NCs and CO dissociation was observed at 300 K. C&#8208; and O&#8208;precovered Fe&#8208;NCs showed no catalytic activity towards CO dissociation because the hollow/edge sites were blocked by the C and O atoms. Therefore, these adsorption sites were identified to be the most active sites of the Fe&#8208;NCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of Semiconductor Heterojunctions for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nature, structure and electronic properties of some example of binary and ternary heterostructure relevant in photocatalysis experiments is reported in this work, focusing on important computational aspects such as the band gap problem, quantum size effects, band edges alignment, surface termination and on the insights that simulation can provide when designing new materials.







Abstract
Electronic structure calculations provide a useful complement to experimental characterization tools in the atomic&#8208;scale design of semiconductor heterojunctions for photocatalysis. The band alignment of the heterojunction is of fundamental importance to achieve an efficient charge carrier separation, so as to reduce electron/hole recombination and improve photoactivity. The accurate prediction of the offsets of valence and conduction bands in the constituent units is thus of key importance but poses several methodological and practical problems. In this Minireview we address some of these problems by considering selected examples of binary and ternary semiconductor heterojunctions and how these are determined at the level of density functional theory (DFT). The atomically precise description of the interface, the consequent charge polarization, the role of quantum confinement, the possibility to use facet engineering to determine a specific band alignment, are among the effects discussed, with particular attention to pros and cons of each one of these aspects. This analysis shows the increasingly important role of accurate electronic structure calculations to drive the design and the preparation of new interfaces with desired properties.

         <title>Local Light&#8208;Controlled Generation of Calcium Carbonate and Barium Carbonate Biomorphs via Photochemical Stimulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Local irradiation of a liquid precursor leads to the space&#8208; and time&#8208;controlled photogeneration of calcium carbonate crystals and biomorphs. The method is based on the photodecarboxylation of an organic precursor, and it was optimized to avoid precipitation of organic matter and pH changes. By tuning the light intensity, the morphology of the resulting biomorphs can be controlled.







Abstract
Photochemical activation is proposed as a general method for controlling the crystallization of sparingly soluble carbonates in space and time. The photogeneration of carbonate in an alkaline environment is achieved upon photo&#8208;decarboxylation of an organic precursor by using a conventional 365&#8197;nm UV LED. Local irradiation was conducted focusing the LED light on a 300&#8197;&#956;m radius spot on a closed glass crystallization cell. The precursor solution was optimized to avoid the precipitation of the photoreaction organic byproducts and prevent photo&#8208;induced pH changes to achieve the formation of calcium carbonate only in the corresponding irradiated area. The crystallization was monitored in real&#8208;time by time&#8208;lapse imaging. The method is also shown to work in gels. Similarly, it was also shown to photo&#8208;activate locally the formation of barium carbonate biomorphs. In the last case, the morphology of these biomimetic structures was tuned by changing the irradiation intensity.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalysed Decarbonylation Free Approach to Carbonylative Esterification of 5&#8208;HMF to Its Aryl Esters Synthesis Using Aryl Halides and Oxalic Acid as C1 Source</title>

         <dc:description>
Aldehyde unaffected: Selective carbonylative esterification of 5&#8208;HMF was achieved on a polystyrene&#8208;supported palladium (Pd@PS) catalyst with aryl halides as coupling partner. Using oxalic acid as a solid and environmentally benign CO source avoided the need for highly sophisticated equipment to trap CO gas. A series of aryl esters of 5&#8208;HMF were synthesized in good&#8208;to&#8208;moderate yield by overcoming the issue of decarbonylation.







Abstract
A decarbonylation free, polystyrene&#8208;supported, Pd (Pd@PS)&#8208;catalysed carbonylative esterification of the hydroxy group of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl furfural (5&#8208;HMF) to its corresponding aryl esters has been developed. The use of Pd@PS, oxalic acid as CO source, and aryl halides was first explored for the aryl ester of 5&#8208;HMF synthesis. Here, we investigated the vital role of a polystyrene support to avoid the commonly known decarbonylation of 5&#8208;HMF. The reaction exhibits vast substrate scope with comparably good yield and catalyst recyclability.

         <title>Fluorescent Molecular Logic Gates Driven by Temperature and by Protons in Solution and on Solid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single family of compounds, 1,3,5&#8208;triaryl&#8208;&#916;2&#8208;pyrazolines, produces fluorescent logic gates in aqueous solution and on solid silica microparticles with H+ and temperature as inputs. H+&#8208;driven YES, PASS 1, YES+PASS 1, NOT, as well as temperature&#8208;driven NOT gates are demonstrated. H+&#8208;driven logic gates are based on photoinduced electron transfer (PET), whereas the temperature&#8208;driven cases depend on C(5)&#8722;N(1) predissociation. Temperature&#8208;driven YES logic gates based on polyacrylamide polymers alongside push&#8211;pull benzofurazans are also introduced for tagging solid particles.







Abstract
Temperature&#8208;driven fluorescent NOT logic is demonstrated by exploiting predissociation in a 1,3,5&#8208;trisubstituted &#916;2&#8208;pyrazoline on its own and when grafted onto silica microparticles. Related &#916;2&#8208;pyrazolines become proton&#8208;driven YES and NOT logic gates on the basis of fluorescent photoinduced electron transfer (PET) switches. Additional PASS 1 and YES+PASS 1 logic gates on silica are also demonstrated within the same family. Beside these small&#8208;molecule systems, a polymeric molecular thermometer based on a benzofurazan&#8208;derivatized N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide copolymer is attached to silica to produce temperature&#8208;driven fluorescent YES logic.

         <title>Catalyst Deactivation During Rhodium Complex&#8208;Catalyzed Propargylic C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the complete mechanistic elucidation of rhodium&#8208;catalyzed propargylic C&#8722;H activation is presented. Particular attention is paid to the deactivation pathway of the catalytic reaction. The associated deactivated species has been studied in detail by NMR and Raman spectroscopy as well as X&#8208;ray crystallography. Furthermore, the present work includes a kinetic study carried out by in&#8197;situ operando NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Detailed mechanistic investigations on our previously reported synthesis of branched allylic esters by the rhodium complex&#8208;catalyzed propargylic C&#8722;H activation have been carried out. Based on initial mechanistic studies, we present herein more detailed investigations of the reaction mechanism. For this, various analytical (NMR, X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis, Raman) and kinetic methods were used to characterize the formation of intermediates under the reaction conditions. The knowledge obtained by this was used to further optimize the previous conditions and generate a more active catalytic system.

         <title>Walter Reppe Revival &#8211; Identification and Genesis of Copper Acetylides Cu2C2 as Active Species in Ethynylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper acetylides, Cu2C2, have been proposed as catalytically active species in reactions with acetylene by Walter Reppe decades ago. The present study succeeded for the first time with the doubtless experimental identification of the explosive material as active species in the ethynylation of formaldehyde to 1,4&#8208;butynediol by correlation with the performance of supported Cu/Bi/SiO2 and bulk Cu2C2 catalysts.







Abstract
More than six decades after proposing copper acetylide, Cu2C2, as catalytically active species in ethynylation reactions by Walter Reppe, the explosive species have been experimentally identified and investigated during catalysis in detail now. Taking into account specific safety precautions, unequivocal qualitative characterization was achieved by Raman spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray powder diffraction of supported copper catalysts Cu/Bi/SiO2 during and after activation and catalysis in comparison to bulk Cu2C2 materials. Quantification of Cu2C2 succeeded by thermal analysis and Raman spectroscopy. Its formation in aqueous suspension is studied starting from copper(II) oxide catalysts including dissolution, reduction and precipitation steps. Copper acetylide formation can be correlated with catalytic performance in the ethynylation of formaldehyde to 1,4&#8208;butynediol.

         <title>Communication of Bichromophore Emission upon Aggregation &#8211; Aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene Acetals as Multifunctional Sensor Merocyanines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional shining tool: A library of 31&#8197;aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetal solid&#8208;state emissive bichromophores, synthesized by a consecutive three&#8208;component reaction (3CR), exhibits aggregation induced emission (AIE), acidochromicity, as well as dual emission and energy transfer in aggregates suitable for alcoholic beverage analysis and encapsulation in micrometer sized polystyrene particles with enhanced fluorescence quantum yield.







Abstract
Aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetal&#8208;based bichromophores can be readily synthesized in a consecutive three&#8208;component synthesis in good to excellent yields by condensation of aroyl chlorides and an N&#8208;(p&#8208;bromobenzyl) 2&#8208;methyl benzothiazolium salt followed by a Suzuki coupling, yielding a library of 31&#8197;bichromophoric fluorophores with substitution pattern&#8208;tunable emission properties. Varying both chromophores enables different communication pathways between the chromophores, exploiting aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and energy transfer (ET) properties, and thus, furnishing aggregation&#8208;based fluorescence switches. Possible applications range from fluorometric analysis of alcoholic beverages to pH sensors.

         <title>A Small&#8208;molecule Diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based Dye for in vivo NIR&#8208;IIa Fluorescence Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic small&#8208;molecule fluorophores with near&#8208;infrared IIa (NIR&#8208;IIa) emission have great potential in pre&#8208;clinical detection and inoperative imaging due to the high&#8208;spatial resolution and deep penetration. However, developments of the NIR&#8208;IIa fluorophores are still facing considerable challenges. In this work, a series of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)&#8208;based fluorophores were designed and synthesized. Subsequently, nanomaterial  T25@F127  with significant NIR&#8208;IIa emission properties was rationally prepared by encapsulating DPP&#8208;based fluorophore  T25  , and was selected for fluorescence angiography and cerebral vascular microscopic imaging with nearly 800 &#956;m penetrating depth and excellent signal&#8208;background ratio of 4.07 and 2.26 (at 250 and 400 &#956;m) , respectively. Furthermore, the nanomaterial  T25@cRGD  with tumor targeting ability can image tiny metastatic tumor on intestine with a small size of 0.3 mm&#215;1.0 mm and high&#8208;spatial resolution (SBR = 3.84). This study demonstrates that the nanomaterials which encapsulated  T25  behave as excellent NIR&#8208;IIa fluorescence imaging agents and have a great potential for  in vivo  biological application.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Recognition of Racemic Amino Alcohols in Aqueous Solution by Chiral Metal&#8208;Oxide Keplerate {Mo132} Cluster Capsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral resolution of racemic amino alcohol guests (phenylalaninol and 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol) has been achieved by using a chirally coordinated enantiopure polyoxometalate host, {Mo132(lactate)30}. NMR spectroscopic methods, including DOSY measurements, were applied to determine the enantiomeric excesses of guest mixtures in addition to the association constants of the host&#8208;guest system binding process.







Abstract
Determining the relative configuration or enantiomeric excess of a substance may be achieved using NMR spectroscopy by employing chiral shift reagents (CSRs). Such reagents interact noncovalently with the chiral solute, resulting in each chiral form experiencing different magnetic anisotropy; this is then reflected in their NMR spectra. The Keplerate polyoxometalate (POM) is a molybdenum&#8208;based, water&#8208;soluble, discrete inorganic structure with a pore&#8208;accessible inner cavity, decorated by differentiable ligands. Through ligand exchange from the self&#8208;assembled nanostructure, a set of chiral Keplerate host molecules has been synthesised. By exploiting the interactions of analyte molecules at the surface pores, the relative configuration of chiral amino alcohol guests (phenylalaninol and 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol) in aqueous solvent was establish and their enantiomeric excess was determined by 1H NMR using shifts of &#916;&#916;&#948;=0.06&#8197;ppm. The use of POMs as chiral shift reagents represents an application of a class that is yet to be well established and opens avenues into aqueous host&#8208;guest chemistry with self&#8208;assembled recognition agents.

         <title>Polymer Nanodiscs and Their Bioanalytical Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discovering discs: Although understanding membrane protein (MP) structure and activity is invaluable for rational drug design, challenges are associated with purification and analysis of MPs. Synthetic polymer nanodiscs, structures that arise from amphipathic copolymers capturing membrane proteins and surrounding phospholipids, offer a convenient detergent&#8208;free solution. This review explores the scope of possible analytical applications for polymer nanodiscs in the study of MPs and biomolecules.







Abstract
Membrane proteins (MPs) play a pivotal role in cellular function and are therefore predominant pharmaceutical targets. Although detailed understanding of MP structure and mechanistic activity is invaluable for rational drug design, challenges are associated with the purification and study of MPs. This review delves into the historical developments that became the prelude to currently available membrane mimetic technologies before shining a spotlight on polymer nanodiscs. These are soluble nanosized particles capable of encompassing MPs embedded in a phospholipid ring. The expanding range of reported amphipathic polymer nanodisc materials is presented and discussed in terms of their tolerance to different solution conditions and their nanodisc properties. Finally, the analytical scope of polymer nanodiscs is considered in both the demonstration of basic nanodisc parameters as well as in the elucidation of structures, lipid&#8211;protein interactions, and the functional mechanisms of reconstituted membrane proteins. The final emphasis is given to the unique benefits and applications demonstrated for native nanodiscs accessed through a detergent free process.

         <title>Triplet Exciton Upconverting Blue Exciplex Host for Deep Blue Phosphors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stopping diodes from dying: A TADF exciplex host managing positive polarons and stabilizing excitons was developed to improve the efficiency and device lifetime of blue phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. A higher external quantum efficiency of over 20&#8201;% and doubled device lifetime with deep blue color coordinate were realized in the blue phosphorescent OLEDs by using the new exciplex host system.







Abstract
A thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;type exciplex host employing a novel electron&#8208;transport type (n&#8208;type) type host managing positive polarons and stabilizing excitons was developed to elongate the device lifetime of deep blue phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (PhOLEDs). The bipolar n&#8208;type host was designed to prevent hole leakage and secure hole stability while being stabilized under excitons by introducing a CN&#8208;modified carbazole moiety as a weak donor. The TADF&#8208;type exciplex host&#8208;based blue PhOLEDs showed high (above 20&#8201;%) quantum efficiency with a deep blue color coordinate of (0.14, 0.16) and elongated device lifetime. The device operational lifetime of the blue PhOLEDs bearing the TADF&#8208;type exciplex host was extended by more than twice compared to that of the exciplex&#8208;free unipolar host. This work suggested a design concept of the n&#8208;type host to develop the TADF&#8208;type exciplex host for deep blue phosphors to reach a long lifespan in the deep blue PhOLEDs.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tunable, Redox&#8208;Active Octapalladium Chains Supported by Linear Tetraphosphines, Leading to Dynamically 1D Self&#8208;Assembled Coordination Polymers</title>

         <dc:description>
Dynamically 1D assembled linear Pd8 chains with bisisocyanide linkers are shown against a backdrop of contrails lit from below by the rising sun. A variety of Pd8 chains with a linear tetraphosphine, meso&#8208;dpmppm, were synthesized through both covalent and noncovalent interactions between two Pd4 fragments. They exhibited fine&#8208;tunable electronic states, a wide range of redox properties, and dynamic 1D self&#8208;assembly in solution. These findings could lead to the next frontier in exploring new functions with dynamically aggregated metal building blocks. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T. Tanase et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101715).

         <title>Ytterbium (II) Hydride as a Powerful Multielectron Reductant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular ytterbium(II) hydride enables the two&#8208;electron aromatization of 1,3,5,7&#8208;cyclooctatetraene to provide an inverse sandwich diytterbium cyclooctatetraenyl derivative and hydrogen gas. This reactivity was extended to the more challenging two&#8208;electron reduction of polyaromatic hydrocarbons, including naphthalene (E0=&#8722;2.60&#8197;V), with retention of metal oxidation state. This reactivity proceeds via consecutive polarized Yb&#8722;H/C=C insertion and deprotonation pathways that occurs at the dimeric hydride reagent.







Abstract
A dimeric &#946;&#8208;diketiminato ytterbium(II) hydride affects both the two&#8208;electron aromatization of 1,3,5,7&#8208;cyclooctatetraene (COT) and the more challenging two&#8208;electron reduction of polyaromatic hydrocarbons, including naphthalene (E0=&#8722;2.60&#8197;V). Confirmed by Density Functional Theory calculations, these reactions proceed via consecutive polarized Yb&#8722;H/C=C insertion and deprotonation steps to provide the respective ytterbium (II) inverse sandwich complexes and hydrogen gas. These observations highlight the ability of a simple ytterbium(II) hydride to act as a powerful two&#8208;electron reductant at room temperature without the necessity of an external electron to initiate the reaction and avoiding radicaloid intermediates.

         <title>Upgrading Octane Number of Naphtha by a Robust and Easily Attainable Metal&#8211;Organic Framework through Selective Molecular Sieving of Alkane Isomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naphtha was separated by using a easily attainable metal&#8211;organic framework, Co3(HCOO)6, through selective molecular exclusion of alkane isomers with different degrees of branching. The separation capability of the compound was evaluated by using naphtha mixtures with 180+ hydrocarbon components. Co3(HCOO)6 exhibited efficient separation of the mixture and thus yielded products with high octane ratings and high dynamic capacity. More information can be found in the Communication by H. Wang, Q. Gong, J. Li, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101871).

         <title>Total Synthesis of Aetokthonotoxin, the Cyanobacterial Neurotoxin Causing Vacuolar Myelinopathy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesizing the &#8220;wanted&#8221; bald eagle killer: Aetokthonotoxin (AETX), a pentabrominated 1,2&#8217;&#8208;biindole alkaloid has been indicted to elicit vacuolar myelinopathy, a neurologic disease causing the death of birds of prey, such as the bald eagle in the USA. In order to assess further biological activity studies, synthesis of this neurotoxin is decidedly needed. Here, we describe its first total synthesis: by fusing advanced indole intermediates in a Somei&#8208;type Michael reaction in only five steps overall. More information can be found in the Communication by M.&#8197;G. Ricardo, B. Westermann, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101848).

         <title>Remodeling of the Fibrillation Pathway of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein by Interaction with Antimicrobial Peptide LL&#8208;III</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation plus the droplet formation of proteins has emerged as a key mechanism for intracellular organization, but there is also evidence linking it to a variety of medical conditions. Pathological aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, which is causally linked to Parkinson's disease, can proceed via such droplet condensation. We show that the antimicrobial peptide LL&#8208;III is able to interact with both monomers and condensates of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, stabilizing the droplet phase and preventing conversion to the toxic fibrillar state. More information can be found in the Communication by R. Oliva, R. Winter, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101592).

We show that the antimicrobial peptide LL-III is able to interact with both monomers and condensates of &#945;-synuclein, stabilizing the droplet phase and preventing conversion to the toxic fibrillar state. More information can be found in the Communication by R. Oliva, R. Winter, et&#8197;al. (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202101592"&gt;10.1002/chem.202101592&lt;/a&gt;).

         <title>A full flexible NH4+&#160; ion battery based on the concentrated hydrogel electrolyte for enhanced performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonmetal ammonium&#160; NH  4  +  &#160;ions have recently been explored as effective charge carriers in battery systems due to their abundancy, light weight, small hydration shells in water. The research concerning the use of NH  4  +  &#160;ion&#160;redox chemistry&#160;in flexible batteries, is still in its infancy. For the first time, we report a flexible full&#160; NH  4  +  &#160;ion battery (AIB) composed of a concentrated hydrogel electrolyte sandwiched between NH4V3O8&#183;2.9H2O nanobelts cathode and polyaniline (PANI) anode. The hydrogel electrolyte is simply synthesized by using ammonium sulfate, xanthan gum and water. As a reference,&#160;AIB based on the liquid aqueous electrolyte is prepared first, which exhibits a capacity of 121 mAh g&#8208;1&#160; and capacity retention of 95% after 400 cycles at a specific current of 0.1 A g&#160;&#8208;1. The full flexible AIBs are then fabricated using hydrogel electrolytes with varied salt concentrations, to maximize the electrochemical performance. It is found that the battery based on the hydrogel electrolyte prepared from 3 M ammonium sulfate solution shows the best electrochemical performance&#160;i.e., a capacity of 60 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;while maintaining a capacity retention of 88% after 250 cycles at a specific current of 0.1 A g&#160; &#8208;1. Moreover, the flexible AIB retains excellent electrochemical performance when bent at different angles, demonstrating remarkable mechanical strength and flexibility. Therefore, this study sheds new light on the utilization of concentrated hydrogel electrolyte in the AIB chemistry, for future developments of new electrochemical energy storage technology.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Photoaffinity Probes for Live&#8208;Cell MS&#8208;Based Proteomics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a one&#8208;step Ugi reaction protocol for the expedient synthesis of photoaffinity probes for live&#8208;cell MS&#8208;based proteomics. The reaction couples an amine affinity function with commonly used photoreactive groups, and a variety of handle functionalities. Using this technology, a series of pan&#8208;BET selective bromodomain photoaffinity probes were obtained by parallel synthesis. Studies on the effects of photoreactive group, linker length and irradiation wavelength on photocrosslinking efficiency provide valuable insights into photoaffinity probe design. Optimal probes were progressed to MS based proteomics to capture the BET family of proteins from live cells and reveal their potential on&#8208; and off&#8208;target profiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Photoswitching in Norbornadiene (NBD)/Quadricyclane (QC) &#8211; Fullerene Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With respect to molecular switches, initializing the quadricyclane (QC) to norbornadiene (NBD) back&#8208;reaction by light is highly desirable. Our previous publication provided a unique solution for this purpose by utilizing covalently bound C60  . In this work, we investigate the fundamental processes within these hybrids. Variation of the linker&#8208;unit connecting the NBD/QC moiety with the fullerene core is used as a tool to tune the properties of the resulting hybrids. Utilizing the Prato reaction two unprecedented NBD/QC &#8208; fullerene hybrids having a long&#8208;rigid and a short&#8208;rigid linker were synthesized. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that this results in an average QC &#8211; C60  distance of up to 14.2 &#197;. By comparing the NBD &#8208; QC switching of these derivatives with the already established one having a flexible linker, valuable mechanistic insights were gained. Most importantly, spatial convergence of the QC moiety and the fullerene core is inevitable for an efficient back&#8208;reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>PdNi/Ni Nanotubes Assembled by Mesoporous Nanoparticles for Efficient Alkaline Ethanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The optimization of structure and composition is essential to improve the performance of catalysts. Herein, mesoporous nanoparticles assembled PdNi/Ni nanotubes (mPdNi/Ni NTs) are successfully fabricated using nickel nanowires as sacrificial template. The combination of nanotubular structure with mesoporous nanoparticle morphology can provide facilitated transfer channels and sufficient active sites, allowing the full contact and reaction between catalysts and reactants. Therefore, the synthesized mPdNi/Ni NTs exhibited superior ethanol oxidation performance to mesoporous Pd nanotubes and commercial Pd black. This study proposes a rational strategy for the development of nanoparticle assembled nanotubes with surface mesoporous morphology, which can greatly improve catalytic performance in various electrocatalytic fields.</dc:description>

The resulting compounds [dpfam  3  LnM][OTf] (Ln = La, Nd and M = Ag, Au) feature a close proximity of the two metal centers and were investigated experimentally by photoluminescence spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>Cata&#8208;Annulated Azaacene Bisimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How high can you go? Cata&#8208;annulation of dicarboximides onto azaacenes lowers the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals and increases reduction potentials up to &#8722;0.35&#8197;V vs. Fc/Fc+, but does not stabilize a tetrakis(dicarboximide)tetraazaheptacene which dimerized regioselectively to its butterfly adduct.







Abstract
Ultra&#8208;electron&#8208;deficient azaacenes were synthesized via Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig coupling of ortho&#8208;diaminoarenes with chlorinated mellophanic diimide followed by oxidation of the intermediate N,N&#8217;&#8208;dihydro compounds with MnO2 or PbO2. The resulting cata&#8208;annulated bisimide azaacenes have ultrahigh electron affinities with first reduction potentials as low as &#8722;0.35&#8197;V recorded for a tetraazapentacene. Attempts to prepare a tetrakis(dicarboximide)tetraazaheptacene resulted in the formation of a symmetric butterfly dimer.

         <title>Allenes and Dienes as Chiral Allylmetal Pronucleophiles in Catalytic Enantioselective C=X Addition: Historical Perspective and State&#8208;of&#8208;The&#8208;Art Survey</title>

         <dc:description>
Beyond preformed allylmetal reagents: In this review, the emerging use of allenes and dienes as chiral allylmetal pronucleophiles in catalytic enantioselective reductive additions to aldehydes, ketones, imines, carbon dioxide and other C=X (X=C, O, N) electrophiles is exhaustively catalogued.







Abstract
The use of allenes and 1,3&#8208;dienes as chiral allylmetal pronucleophiles in intermolecular catalytic enantioselective reductive additions to aldehydes, ketones, imines, carbon dioxide and other C=X electrophiles is exhaustively catalogued together with redox&#8208;neutral hydrogen auto&#8208;transfer processes. Coverage is limited to processes that result in both C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C bond formation. The use of alkynes as latent allylmetal pronucleophiles and multicomponent C=X allylations involving allenes and dienes is not covered. As illustrated in this review, the ability of allenes and 1,3&#8208;dienes to serve as tractable non&#8208;metallic pronucleophiles has evoked many useful transformations that have no counterpart in traditional allylmetal chemistry.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pnictinidenes are an increasingly relevant species in main group chemistry and generally exhibit proclivity for the triplet electronic ground state. However, the elusive singlet electronic states are often desired for chemical applications. We predict the singlet&#8208;triplet energy differences (&#916;EST = ESinglet &#8722; ETriplet) of simple group 15 and 16 substituted pnictinidenes (Pn&#8208;R; Pn = P, As, Sb, or Bi) with highly reliable focal&#8208;point analyses targeting the CCSDTQ/CBS level of theory. The only cases we predict to have favorable singlet states are P&#8208;PH2 (&#8722;3.2 kcal mol&#8208;1) and P&#8208;NH2 (&#8722;0.2 kcal mol&#8208;1). &#916;EST trends are discussed in light of the geometric predictions as well as qualitative natural bond order analysis to elucidate some of the important electronic structure features. Our work provides a rigorous benchmark for the &#916;EST of fundamental Pn&#8208;R moieties and provides a firm foundation for the continued study of heavier pnictinidenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of the Redox&#8208;Transmetalation Procedure to Access Divalent Lanthanide and Alkaline&#8208;Earth NHC Complexes**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;transmetalation is the key: NHC complexes of divalent lanthanides (Sm, Eu, Yb) and alkaline&#8208;earth metals (Ca, Sr) have been accessed by a redox&#8208;transmetalation strategy from NHC&#8208;AgI complexes, a viable procedure when the classical and non&#8208;redox transmetalation methodology fails to proceed. Trends in the bonding of the NHC ligands were established from a detailed experimental and computational analysis.







Abstract
Divalent lanthanide and alkaline&#8208;earth complexes supported by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands have been accessed by redox&#8208;transmetalation between air&#8208;stable NHC&#8208;AgI complexes and the corresponding metals. By using the small ligand 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IMe), two series of isostructural complexes were obtained: the tetra&#8208;NHC complexes [LnI2(IMe)4] (Ln=Eu and Sm) and the bis&#8208;NHC complexes [MI2(IMe)2(THF)2] (M=Yb, Ca and Sr). In the former, distortions in the NHC coordination were found to originate from intermolecular repulsions in the solid state. Application of the redox&#8208;transmetalation strategy with the bulkier 1,3&#8208;dimesitylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IMes) ligand yielded [SrI2(IMes)(THF)3], while using a similar procedure with Ca metal led to [CaI2(THF)4] and uncoordinated IMes. DFT calculations were performed to rationalise the selective formation of the bis&#8208;NHC adduct in [SrI2(IMe)2(THF)2] and the tetra&#8208;NHC adduct in [SmI2(IMe)4]. Since the results in the gas phase point towards preferential formation of the tetra&#8208;NHC complexes for both metal centres, the differences between both arrangements are a result of solid&#8208;state effects such as slightly different packing forces.

         <title>Bulky Barbiturates as Non&#8208;Toxic Ionic Dye Insulators for Enhanced Emission in Polymeric Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulky hydrophobic anions based on fluorinated C&#8208;acyl barbiturates with delocalized negative charge are found to provide insulation of ionic dyes, thus preventing their aggregation&#8208;caused quenching in polymeric nanoparticles. Their chemical structure defines dye encapsulation, particle brightness and on/off switching. Compared to currently used anions, C&#8208;acyl barbiturates are non&#8208;toxic, while offering chemical availability and versatility.







Abstract
Bulky hydrophobic counterions (weakly coordinating anions) can insulate ionic dyes against aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) and enable preparation of highly fluorescent dye&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (NPs) for bioimaging, biosensing and light harvesting. Here, we introduce a family of hydrophobic anions based on fluorinated C&#8208;acyl barbiturates with delocalized negative charge and bulky non&#8208;polar groups. Similarly to fluorinated tetraphenylborates, these barbiturates prevent ACQ of cationic dye alkyl rhodamine B inside polymer NPs made of biodegradable poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA). Their efficiency to prevent ACQ increases for analogues with higher acidity and bulkiness. Their structure controls dye&#8208;dye communication, yielding bright NPs with on/off switching or stable emission. They enhance dye encapsulation inside NPs, allowing intracellular imaging without dye leakage. Compared to fluorinated tetraphenylborates known as cytotoxic transmembrane ion transporters, the barbiturates display a significantly lower cytotoxicity. These chemically available and versatile barbiturate derivatives are promising counterion scaffolds for preparation of bright non&#8208;toxic fluorescent nanomaterials.

Recharging your batteries: Brick&#8208;like (NH4)2V7O16, which features an open&#8208;layered structure with two NH4+ ions residing in the V7O16 layers, undergoes ammonium ion extraction and insertion processes during cycling. Two novel full cell systems, (NH4)2V7O16||Li2SO4||LiMn2O4 and (NH4)2V7O16||Na2SO4||LiMn2O4 (shown), both demonstrate good rate capability and excellent cycling performance, thus suggesting that the layered (NH4)2V7O16 could be a promising anode material for aqueous rechargeable lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Searching for novel anode materials to address the issues of poor cycle stability in the aqueous lithium&#8208;ion battery system is highly desirable. In this work, ammonium vanadium bronze (NH4)2V7O16 with brick&#8208;like morphology has been investigated as an anode material for aqueous lithium&#8208;ion batteries and Li+/Na+ hybrid ion batteries. The two novel full cell systems (NH4)2V7O16||Li2SO4||LiMn2O4 and (NH4)2V7O16||Na2SO4||LiMn2O4 both demonstrate good rate capability and excellent cycling performance. A capacity retention of 78.61&#8201;% after 500 cycles at 300&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 was demonstrated in the (NH4)2V7O16||Li2SO4||LiMn2O4 system, whereas no capacity attenuation is observed in the (NH4)2V7O16||Na2SO4||LiMn2O4 system. The reaction mechanisms of the (NH4)2V7O16 electrode and impedance variation of the two full cells were also researched. The excellent cycling stability suggests that layered (NH4)2V7O16 can be a promising anode material for aqueous rechargeable lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Azo&#8208;Bridged Furoxanylazoles as High&#8208;Performance Energetic Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of novel energetic materials comprising of azo&#8208;bridged furoxanylazoles enriched with energetic functionalities was designed and synthesized. These high&#8208;energy materials were thoroughly characterized by IR and multinuclear NMR (  1  H,  13  C,  14  N) spectroscopy, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The molecular structures of representative amino and azo oxadiazole assemblies were additionally confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and X&#8208;ray powder diffraction. A comparison of contributions of explosophoric moieties into the density of energetic materials revealed that furoxan and 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole rings are the densest motifs while the substitution of the azide and amino fragments on the nitro and azo ones leads to an increase of the density. Azo bridged energetic materials have high nitrogen&#8208;oxygen contents (68.8&#8208;76.9%) and high thermal stability. The synthesized compounds exhibit good experimental densities (1.62&#8208;1.88 g cm  &#8208;3  ), very high enthalpies of formation (846&#8208;1720 kJ mol  &#8208;1  ), and, as a result, excellent detonation performance (detonation velocities 7.66&#8208;9.09 km s  &#8208;1  and detonation pressures 25.0&#8208;37.7 GPa). From the application perspective, the detonation parameters of azo oxadiazole assemblies exceed those of the benchmark explosive RDX, while a combination of high detonation performance and acceptable friction sensitivity of azo(1,2,4&#8208;triazolylfuroxan) make it a promising potential alternative to PETN.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The use of weak and inexpensive bases has recently opened promising perspectives towards the simpler and more sustainable synthesis of Au(I)&#8208;aryl complexes with valuable applications in catalysis, medicinal chemistry, and materials science. In recent years, continuous manufacturing has shown to be a reliable partner in establishing sustainable and controlled process scalability. Herein, the first continuous flow synthesis of a range of Au(I)&#8208;aryl starting from widely available boronic acids and various [Au(NHC)Cl] (NHC =  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene) complexes in unprecedentedly short reaction times and high yields is reported.

         <title>Sodium Butylated Hydroxytoluene: A Functional Group Tolerant, Eco&#8208;Friendly Base for Solvent&#8208;Free, Pd&#8208;Catalysed Amination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green amination: Sodium butylated hydroxytoluene (NaBHT) has been shown to be a highly efficient base for the solvent&#8208;free (melt) amination of a wide variety of substrates, including those containing base&#8208;sensitive and redox&#8208;active functional groups.







Abstract
NaBHT (sodium 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenolate), a strong, but hindered and lipophilic base, has been effectively paired with similarly lipophilic, high&#8208;reactivity Pd&#8208;NHC (N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) catalysts to produce an ideal combination for performing solvent&#8208;free (melt) cross&#8208;coupling amination. The mild nucleophilicity of NaBHT, coupled with the anti&#8208;oxidant properties of its conjugate acid byproduct, BHT means the process seems to have no functional group incompatibilities. Highly effective coupling of base&#8208;sensitive and redox&#8208;active functional groups was observed in all cases with only 0.1&#8211;0.2&#8197;mol percent catalyst.

     alt="Sodium Butylated Hydroxytoluene: A Functional Group Tolerant, Eco-Friendly Base for Solvent-Free, Pd-Catalysed Amination"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Green amination&lt;/b&gt;: Sodium butylated hydroxytoluene (NaBHT) has been shown to be a highly efficient base for the solvent-free (melt) amination of a wide variety of substrates, including those containing base-sensitive and redox-active functional groups.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NaBHT (sodium 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenolate), a strong, but hindered and lipophilic base, has been effectively paired with similarly lipophilic, high-reactivity Pd-NHC (N-heterocyclic carbene) catalysts to produce an ideal combination for performing solvent-free (melt) cross-coupling amination. The mild nucleophilicity of NaBHT, coupled with the anti-oxidant properties of its conjugate acid byproduct, BHT means the process seems to have no functional group incompatibilities. Highly effective coupling of base-sensitive and redox-active functional groups was observed in all cases with only 0.1&#8211;0.2&#8197;mol percent catalyst. Comparisons using the standard base for this reaction, KOtBu, led to poor couplings or complete degradation in most applications &#8211; only NaBHT works.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Reversible Self&#8208;Assembly of Gold Nanoparticles Based on Co&#8208;Functionalization with Zwitterionic and Cationic Binding Motifs**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Au nanoparticles co&#8208;functionalized with guanidiniocarbonyl pyrrole carboxylate zwitterions (GCPZ) and guanidiniocarbonyl pyrrole carboxylates (GCP) show a a multi&#8208;pH&#8208;controlled and temperature&#8208;controlled reversible self&#8208;assembly in water. When both binding motifs are installed in a carefully balanced ratio, the Au nanoparticles possess seven alternating regimes in which they are assembled/disassembled, simply controlled by pH and temperature.







Abstract
We report a pH&#8208; and temperature&#8208;controlled reversible self&#8208;assembly of Au&#8208;nanoparticles (AuNPs) in water, based on their surface modification with cationic guanidiniocarbonyl pyrrole (GCP) and zwitterionic guanidiniocarbonyl pyrrole carboxylate (GCPZ) binding motifs. When both binding motifs are installed in a carefully balanced ratio, the resulting functionalized AuNPs self&#8208;assemble at pH&#8197;1, pH&#8197;7 and pH&#8197;13, whereas they disassemble at pH&#8197;3 and pH&#8197;11. Further disassembly can be achieved at elevated temperatures at pH&#8197;1 and pH&#8197;13. Thus, we were able to prepare functionalized nanoparticles that can be assembled/disassembled in seven alternating regimes, simply controlled by pH and temperature.

         <title>Bidentate Disilicate Framework for Bis&#8208;Grafted Surface Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular precursor bearing a bidentate disilicate ligand, &#8722;OSi(OtBu)2OSi(OtBu)2O&#8722;, was grafted on silica supports by substitution reaction on silicon atoms of the disilicate ligand to selectively form bis&#8208;grafted surface species.







Abstract
Recent advances in surface organometallic chemistry have enabled the detailed characterization of the surface species in single&#8208;site heterogeneous catalysts. However, the selective formation of bis&#8208;grafted surface species remains challenging because of the heterogeneity of the supporting surface. Herein, we introduce a metal complex bearing bidentate disilicate ligands, &#8722;OSi(OtBu)2OSi(OtBu)2O&#8722;, as a molecular precursor, which has a silicate framework adjacent to the metal (Pt) center. The grafting of the precursors on silica supports (MCM&#8208;41 and CARiACT Q10) proceeded through a substitution reaction on the silicon atoms of the disilicate ligand, which was verified by the detection of isobutene and tBuOH as the elimination products, to selectively yield bis&#8208;grafted surface species. The chemical structure of the surface species was characterized by solid&#8208;state NMR, and the chemical shift values of the ancillary ligands and 195Pt nuclei suggested that the bidentate coordination sphere was maintained following grafting.

         <title>Strategy of Graphdiyne (g&#8722;CnH2n&#8208;2 ) Preparation Coupling with the Flower&#8208;Like NiAl&#8208;LDH Heterjunctions for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution**

         <dc:description>
Graphdyine nanosheets were synthesized successfully by employing cross&#8208;coupling method with CuI as the catalyst and the composite copper iodide&#8208;graphdyine (CuI&#8208;GD) composite was coupled with the flower&#8208;like layered double hydroxide (NiAl&#8208;LDH) to construct an S&#8208;scheme for producing H2 from photocatalytic water splitting. The spherical flower&#8208;like NiAl&#8208;LDH can support CuI&#8208;GD to prevent it from aggregation. A greatly improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance was obtained in the sensitized system.







Abstract
Graphdiyne (g&#8722;CnH2n&#8208;2), a novel two&#8208;dimension carbon allotrope material composed of a sp&#8208; and sp2&#8208;hybrid carbon network, has been widely explored since it was synthesized for the first time by Li's group in 2010. A series distinct and excellent properties bestow graphdiyne excellent performance in many fields. Here, an innovative progress for preparing graphdiyne by using Cu+ contained material as catalyst is reported and the composite CuI&#8208;GD is coupled with flower&#8208;like NiAl&#8208;LDH to produce H2 from photocatalytic water splitting. The results of FTIR and Raman spectroscopy together reveal that graphdiyne nanosheets are synthesized successfully by employing a cross&#8208;coupling method. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance shows that the hydrogen production activity of CuI&#8208;GD/NiAl&#8208;LDH has a 15&#8208; and 216&#8208;fold enhancement compared with CuI&#8208;GD and NiAl&#8208;LDH, respectively. A series of characterizations are carried out to expound the underlying reasons in the enhancement of the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of CuI&#8208;GD/NiAl&#8208;LDH. Meanwhile, a possible mechanism for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution process was proposed to understand the interaction among these materials.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A recyclable hybrid&#8208;manganese catalyst was developed for site&#8208;selective azine C&#8722;H activation by weak amide&#8208;assistance with ample substrate scope. The heterogeneous catalyst proved to be reusable, and was analyzed in detail by spectroscopy, spectrometry and transmission electron microscopy.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose a recyclable, hybrid manganese catalyst for site&#8208;selective azine C&#8722;H activation by weak amide assistance. The novel, reusable catalyst enabled C3&#8211;H arylation and C3&#8211;H alkylation with ample scope, and was characterized by detailed transmission electron microscopy analysis.

         <title>Photoelectrochemical Reduction of Carbon Dioxide with a Copper Graphitic Carbon Nitride Photocathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper substituted graphitic carbon nitride is shown to be a photoactive electrocatalyst for the two&#8208;electron reduction of CO2 to CO. Electrocatalytic activity as measured by yield and faradaic efficiency is increased upon irradiation with visible light. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra measured in the presence of visible light exhibit pronounced, &gt;1&#8197;eV, light&#8208;induced shifts to lower binding energies representing significant photoconductivity.







Abstract
Research on the photoreduction of CO2 often has been dominated by the use of sacrificial reducing agents. A pathway that avoids this problem would be the development of photocathodes for CO2 reduction that could then be coupled to a photoanodic oxygen evolution reaction. Here, we present the use of copper&#8208;substituted graphitic carbon nitride (Cu&#8722;CN) on a fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) electrode for the photoelectrochemical two&#8208;electron reduction of CO2 to CO as a major product (&gt;95&#8201;%) and formic acid (&lt;5&#8201;%). The results show that at a potential of &#8722;2.5&#8197;V versus Fc\Fc+ the CO2 reduction activity of Cu&#8722;CN on FTO electrode improves by 25&#8201;% upon illumination by visible light with a faradaic efficiency of nearly 100&#8201;%. Independently, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy conclusively shows a pronounced increase in the electrical conductivity of the Cu&#8722;CN upon white light illumination under vacuum and a contactless measuring configuration. This photo&#8208;assisted charge mobility is shown to play a key role in the increased reactivity and faradaic efficiency for the reduction of CO2.

         <title>Phosphate&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Immolative Linkers for Tuneable Double Cargo Release</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A matter of timing: Phosphate&#8208;based self&#8208;immolative linkers that are suitable for tuneable double cargo release allow 1) programmable slow&#8208;release of the one cargo in 3&#8197;hours, 2) simultaneous release of both cargos within 25&#8197;minutes or 3) sequential release of the first cargo within 15&#8197;minutes followed by the second cargo release within 3&#8197;hours. Optimised linkers are stable and could find further applications in the design of innovative materials and multiple&#8208;drug&#8208;delivery systems.







Abstract
Phosphorus&#8208;based self&#8208;immolative (SI) linkers offer a wide range of applications, such as smart materials and drug&#8208;delivery systems. Phosphorus SI linkers are ideal candidates for double&#8208;cargo delivery platforms because they have a higher valency than carbon. A series of substituted phosphate linkers was designed for releasing two phenolic cargos through SI followed by chemical hydrolysis. Suitable modifications of the lactate spacer increased the cargo release rate significantly, from 1&#8197;day to 2&#8197;hours or 5&#8197;minutes, as shown for linkers containing p&#8208;fluoro phenol. In turn, double cargo linkers bearing p&#8208;methyl phenol released their cargo more slowly (4&#8197;days, 4&#8197;hours, and 15&#8197;minutes) than their p&#8208;fluoro analogues. The &#945;&#8208;hydroxyisobutyrate linker released both cargos in 25&#8197;minutes. Our study expands the current portfolio of SI constructs by providing a double cargo delivery option, which is crucial to develop universal SI platforms.

         <title>ChemBead Enabled High&#8208;Throughput Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling Reveals a New Complementary Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shaken, not stirred: Coating reductants onto glass beads simplifies &#956;mol&#8208;scale cross&#8208;electrophile coupling, enabling the rapid survey of 222 different reactions and the discovery of a new, useful catalyst. Although the reactions are heterogeneous, the glass beads enable the use of shakers instead of complex micro stirrers.







Abstract
High&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) methods are central to modern medicinal chemistry. While many HTE approaches to C&#8722;N and Csp2&#8722;Csp2 bonds are available, options for Csp2&#8722;Csp3 bonds are limited. We report here how the adaptation of nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of aryl bromides with alkyl halides to HTE is enabled by AbbVie ChemBeads technology. By using this approach, we were able to quickly map out the reactivity space at a global level with a challenging array of 3&#215;222 micromolar reactions. The observed hit rate (56&#8201;%) is competitive with other often&#8208;used HTE reactions and the results are scalable. A key to this level of success was the finding that bipyridine 6&#8208;carboxamidine (BpyCam), a ligand that had not previously been shown to be optimal in any reaction, is as general as the best&#8208;known ligands with complementary reactivity. Such &#8220;cryptic&#8221; catalysts may be common and modern HTE methods should facilitate the process of finding these catalysts.

         <title>Germyliumylidene: A Versatile Low Valent Group 14 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The versatile ambiphilic catalytic application of a bis&#8208;NHC&#8208;stabilized germyliumylidene enables a range of reductive functionalization reactions, with a particular emphasis on C=O reduction that is, CO2 and carbonyls.







Abstract
Bis&#8208;NHC stabilized germyliumylidenes [RGe(NHC)2]+ are typically Lewis basic (LB) in nature, owing to their lone pair and coordination of two NHCs to the vacant p&#8208;orbitals of the germanium center. However, they can also show Lewis acidity (LA) via Ge&#8722;CNHC &#963;* orbital. Utilizing this unique electronic feature, we report the first example of bis&#8208;NHC&#8208;stabilized germyliumylidene [MesTerGe(NHC)2]Cl (1), (MesTer=2,6&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2)2C6H3; NHC= IMe4=1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) catalyzed reduction of CO2 with amines and arylsilane, which proceeds via its Lewis basic nature. In contrast, the Lewis acid nature of 1 is utilized in the catalyzed hydroboration and cyanosilylation of carbonyls, thus highlighting the versatile ambiphilic nature of bis&#8208;NHC stabilized germyliumylidenes.

         <title>A Chiral Lanthanide Tag for Stable and Rigid Attachment to Single Cysteine Residues in Proteins for NMR, EPR and Time&#8208;Resolved Luminescence Studies</title>

Lanthanoid keys to proteins: A stable chiral lanthanide(III) tag reacts spontaneously and quantitatively with a cysteine residue to generate a stable thioether bond. The lanthanide&#8208;binding tag presents a tool to probe proteins using multiple spectroscopic techniques, including NMR, electron paramagnetic resonance and time&#8208;resolved FRET experiments.







Abstract
A lanthanide&#8208;binding tag site&#8208;specifically attached to a protein presents a tool to probe the protein by multiple spectroscopic techniques, including nuclear magnetic resonance, electron paramagnetic resonance and time&#8208;resolved luminescence spectroscopy. Here a new stable chiral LnIII tag, referred to as C12, is presented for spontaneous and quantitative reaction with a cysteine residue to generate a stable thioether bond. The synthetic protocol of the tag is relatively straightforward, and the tag is stable for storage and shipping. It displays greatly enhanced reactivity towards selenocysteine, opening a route towards selective tagging of selenocysteine in proteins containing cysteine residues. Loaded with TbIII or TmIII ions, the C12 tag readily generates pseudocontact shifts (PCS) in protein NMR spectra. It produces a relatively rigid tether between lanthanide and protein, which is beneficial for interpretation of the PCSs by single magnetic susceptibility anisotropy tensors, and it is suitable for measuring distance distributions in double electron&#8211;electron resonance experiments. Upon reaction with cysteine or other thiol compounds, the TbIII complex exhibits a 100&#8208;fold enhancement in luminescence quantum yield, affording a highly sensitive turn&#8208;on luminescence probe for time&#8208;resolved FRET assays and enzyme reaction monitoring.

         <title>Ni(II) Precatalysts Enable Thioetherification of (Hetero)Aryl Halides and Tosylates and Tandem C&#8722;S/C&#8722;N Couplings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni(II)&#8208;allyl complexes supported by bulky terphenyl phosphine ligands have been prepared and characterized. These complexes have been used as precatalysts in the formation of C&#8722;S bonds, allowing the efficient coupling between a variety of electrophiles, including aryl chlorides and, for the first time, tosylates, with aromatic and aliphatic thiols. Moreover, differentiated reactivity of the electrophilic partners enables tandem formation of C&#8722;S and C&#8722;N bonds in a single step.







Abstract
Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;S cross&#8208;coupling reactions have received less attention compared with other C&#8208;heteroatom couplings. Most reported examples comprise the thioetherification of most reactive aryl iodides with aromatic thiols. The use of C&#8722;O electrophiles in this context is almost uncharted. Here, we describe that preformed Ni(II) precatalysts of the type NiCl(allyl)(PMe2Ar&#8217;) (Ar&#8217;=terphenyl group) efficiently couple a wide range of (hetero)aryl halides, including challenging aryl chlorides, with a variety of aromatic and aliphatic thiols. Aryl and alkenyl tosylates are also well tolerated, demonstrating, for the first time, to be competent electrophilic partners in Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;S bond formation. The chemoselective functionalization of the C&#8722;I bond in the presence of a C&#8722;Cl bond allows for designing site&#8208;selective tandem C&#8722;S/C&#8722;N couplings. The formation of the two C&#8208;heteroatom bonds takes place in a single operation and represents a rare example of dual electrophile/nucleophile chemoselective process.

         <title>Comparative Nucleosomal Reactivity of 5&#8208;Formyl&#8208;Uridine and 5&#8208;Formyl&#8208;Cytidine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The covalent adduct formation of the oxidative lesions and epigenetic bases 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;deoxyuridine (fdU) and 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (fdC) was investigated comparatively arguing that oxidative stress can have transcriptional consequences.







Abstract
5&#8208;Formyl&#8208;deoxyuridine (fdU) and 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (fdC) are formyl&#8208;containing nucleosides that are created by oxidative stress in differentiated cells. While fdU is almost exclusively an oxidative stress lesion formed from deoxythymidine (T), the situation for fdC is more complex. Next to formation as an oxidative lesion, it is particularly abundant in stem cells, where it is more frequently formed in an epigenetically important oxidation reaction performed by &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate dependent TET enzymes from 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (mdC). Recently, it was shown that genomic fdC and fdU can react with the &#1013;&#8208;aminogroups of nucleosomal lysines to give Schiff base adducts that covalently link nucleosomes to genomic DNA. Here, we show that fdU features a significantly higher reactivity towards lysine side chains compared with fdC. This result shows that depending on the amounts of fdC and fdU, oxidative stress may have a bigger impact on nucleosome binding than epigenetics.

         <title>KCs2[Pb2Br5(HCOO)2]: A Polar 3D Lead&#8208;Bromide Framework Exhibiting Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
KCs2[Pb2Br5(HCOO)2] possessing strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response, large birefringence, and a wide transparent window in most visible light and mid&#8208;IR region, has been obtained by the combination of [HCOO] groups and lead bromides. Interestingly, KCs2[Pb2Br5(HCOO)2] features a polar 3D lead&#8208;bromide framework in which adjacent Pb&#8722;Br layers containing coplanar Pb6Br6 rings not only parallel to each other, but also orient in the same direction. These oriented arrangements are responsible for the strong SHG response and large birefringence that are elucidated by both local dipole moment and theoretical calculations.







Abstract
The discovery of new nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals with excellent properties is in urgently demand because of their ability to generate coherent light. Herein, we report an unique NLO lead bromide formate, KCs2[Pb2Br5 (HCOO)2], which has been synthesized by a mix&#8208;solvothermal method. KCs2[Pb2Br5(HCOO)2] exhibits strong phase&#8208;matching second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response (6.5&#215;KDP), large birefringence (0.16@ 1064&#8197;nm), and a wide transparent window in most visible light and mid&#8208;IR region. Interestingly, KCs2[Pb2Br5(HCOO)2] features a polar 3D lead&#8208;bromide framework in which adjacent Pb&#8722;Br layers containing coplanar Pb6Br6 rings are not only parallel to each other, but also orient in the same direction. These oriented arrangements are responsible for the strong SHG response and large birefringence that are elucidated by both local dipole moment and theoretical calculations. This research provides a new strategy to explore subsequent NLO crystals.

         <title>General, Straightforward, and Atom&#8208;Economical Synthesis of Vinyl Triflimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Greatness in simplicity: A general, straightforward, and atom&#8208;economical protocol to synthesize vinyl triflimides has been developed. A broad spectrum of terminal and internal alkynes could be utilized to generate various di&#8208; and trisubstituted vinyl triflimides. The protocol could be conducted on gram scale using both terminal and internal alkynes. Preliminarily attempts to probe the unprecedented reactivity of vinyl triflimides disclosed part of its unique chemical properties.







Abstract
Vinyl triflimides were only accessible recently and their chemistry is yet to be discovered. Herein, we describe a general, straightforward and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of these materials from alkynes and triflimide.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Greatness in simplicity&lt;/b&gt;: A general, straightforward, and atom-economical protocol to synthesize vinyl triflimides has been developed. A broad spectrum of terminal and internal alkynes could be utilized to generate various di- and trisubstituted vinyl triflimides. The protocol could be conducted on gram scale using both terminal and internal alkynes. Preliminarily attempts to probe the unprecedented reactivity of vinyl triflimides disclosed part of its unique chemical properties.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vinyl triflimides were only accessible recently and their chemistry is yet to be discovered. Herein, we describe a general, straightforward and atom-economical synthesis of these materials from alkynes and triflimide. A vast array of terminal and internal alkynes with broad spectrum of functionalities could be employed to generate various di- and trisubstituted vinyl triflimides regiospecifically with high to specific stereoselectivity. Moreover, the protocol could be conducted on gram scale using terminal and internal alkynes. Preliminarily attempts to probe the unprecedented reactivity of vinyl triflimides revealed part of its chemical properties.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Structure Recovery and Recycling of the Used LiCoO2 Cathode Material</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The large number of lithium batteries have been retiring from the market of energy storage. Thus, the recycling of the used electrode materials is becoming urgent. In this study, the industrial machinery processing was used to recover the crystal structure of the waste LiCoO  2  materials with the combination of small&#8208;scale equipment repair technology. The results show that the crystal parameters of the repaired LiCoO  2  material become small, the unit cell volume is reduced, and the crystal structure tends to be stable. The Co&#8208;O bond length of 1.9134 nm, O&#8208;Co&#8208;O bond angle of 94.72&#186;, the (003) interplanar spacing of 0.467 nm indicate the excellent recovery level of the repaired LiCoO  2  . In addition, the electrochemical performance of the repaired LiCoO  2  material is greatly improved, compared with the waste material. The capacity of the repaired electrode material can be maintained at 120 mAh g  &#8208;1  after 100 cycles at the current density of 0.2 C. The promising rate performance of the repaired electrode material demonstrates the stable structure. This research work provides a large&#8208;scale method for the direct recovery of LiCoO  2  with the reduction of unnecessary energy and reagent consumption, which will be beneficial to the environmental protection.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Investigation of a Synthetic Route to Biaryls via the Sigmatropic Rearrangement of Arylsulfonium Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A comprehensive mechanistic investigation was conducted on the coupling reaction of aryl sulfoxides with phenols by means of trifluoroacetic anhydride to yield biaryls. NMR experiments revealed that our previously proposed mechanism, which consists of a cascade of an interrupted Pummerer reaction and a rate&#8208;determining [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement, is reasonable. The electronic effects of the substrates have also been evaluated to elucidate the nature of the rearrangement step. Based on experimental observations and theoretical calculations, we conclude that the rearrangement is highly asynchronous and stepwise rather than concerted when electron&#8208;rich phenols are employed for the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Lateral Metallation and Redistribution Reactions of Sodium Ferrates Containing Bulky 2,6&#8208;Diisopropyl&#8208;N&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)anilide Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkali&#8208;metal&#160;ferrates containing amide groups have emerged as regioselective bases capable of promoting Fe&#8208;H exchanges of aromatic substrates. Advancing this area of heterobimetallic chemistry, a new series of sodium ferrates is introduced incorporating the bulky arylsilyl amido ligand N(SiMe3)(Dipp) (Dipp= 2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3). Influenced by the large steric demands imposed by this amide, transamination of [NaFe(HMDS)3]&#160;(HMDS = N(SiMe3)2) with an excess of HN(SiMe3)(Dipp)&#160;led to the isolation of heteroleptic&#160;[Na(HMDS)2Fe{N(SiMe3)Dipp}]&#8734;&#160;(1) resulting from the exchange of just one&#160;HMDS&#160;&#160;group. An alternative co&#8208;complexation approach, combining the homometallic metal amides [NaN(SiMe3)Dipp] and [Fe{N(SiMe3)Dipp}2] induces lateral metallation of one Me arm from the SiMe3&#160;group in the iron amide furnishing tetrameric&#160;[NaFe{N(SiCH2Me2)Dipp}{N(SiMe3)Dipp}]4&#160;(2). Reactivity studies support that this deprotonation is driven by the steric incompatibility of the single metal amides rather than the basic capability of the sodium reagent. Displaying synergistic reactivity, heteroleptic sodium ferrate&#160;1&#160;can selectively promote ferration of pentafluorobenzene using one of its HMDS arms to give heterotrileptic&#160;[Na{N(SiMe3)Dipp}(HMDS)Fe(C6F5)]&#8734;&#160;(4).&#160;Attempts to deprotonate less activated pyridine led to the isolation of NaHMDS and heteroleptic Fe(II) amide&#160;[(py)Fe{N(SiMe3)Dipp}(HMDS)] (5),&#160;resulting from an alternative redistribution process which is favoured by the Lewis donor ability of this substrate.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Role of Hydrogen Bonds in Luminescent N&#8208;Annulated Perylene Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on a on the liquid&#8208;crystalline (LC) and luminescent properties of a series of&#160;  N  &#8208;annulated perylenes (  1  &#8208;  4  ) alternating amide and ester groups in their molecular structure. We found that the LC properties of these compounds does not only depends on the number of hydrogen bonding (H&#8208;bonding) units, but also on the relative position of the amide linkers in the molecule. The absence of amide groups in compound&#160;  1  &#160;leads to no LC properties, while the use of four amide groups induces the formation of long temperature range columnar hexagonal phase in compound&#160;  4  . Remarkably, compound&#160;  3,  &#160;bearing two amide groups in the inner part of the structure stabilizes the columnar LC phases better than its structural isomer&#160;  2  , with the amide groups in the outer part of the molecule. In the same direction, we found that only compounds&#160;  1  &#160;and&#160;  2  , with no H&#8208;bonding units in the inner part of the molecule, exhibit luminescence vapochromism upon exposure to organic solvent vapors.</dc:description>

         <title>Umbelliferone Decorated Water&#8208;soluble Zinc(II) Phthalocyanines &#8211; In Vitro Phototoxic Antimicrobial Anti&#8208;cancer Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this contribution we report on the synthesis, characterization and application of water&#8209;soluble zinc(II) phthalocyanines which are decorated with four or eight umbelliferone moieties for photodynamic therapy (PDT). These compounds are linked peripherally to zinc(II) phthalocyanine by a tri(ethylene glycol) linker attached to pyridines, leading to cationic pyridinium units, able to increase the water solubility of the system. Beside their photophysical properties they were analyzed concerning their cellular distribution in human hepatocyte carcinoma (HepG2) cells as well as their phototoxicity towards HepG2 cells, Gram&#8209;positive (S. aureus 3150/12 and B. subtilis DB104) and Gram&#8209;negative bacteria (E. coli UTI89 and E. coli Nissle 1917). At low light doses and concentrations, they exhibit superb antimicrobial activity against Gram&#8209;positive bacteria as well as anti&#8209;tumor activity against HepG2. They are even capable to inactivate Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, whereas the dark toxicity remains low.

These compounds are linked peripherally to zinc(II) phthalocyanine by a tri(ethylene glycol) linker attached to pyridines, leading to cationic pyridinium units, able to increase the water solubility of the system. Beside their photophysical properties they were analyzed concerning their cellular distribution in human hepatocyte carcinoma (HepG2) cells as well as their phototoxicity towards HepG2 cells, Gram&#8209;positive (S. aureus 3150/12 and B. subtilis DB104) and Gram&#8209;negative bacteria (E. coli UTI89 and E. coli Nissle 1917). At low light doses and concentrations, they exhibit superb antimicrobial activity against Gram&#8209;positive bacteria as well as anti&#8209;tumor activity against HepG2. They are even capable to inactivate Gram-negative bacteria, whereas the dark toxicity remains low. These unique water&#8209;soluble compounds can be regarded as all-in-one type photosensitizers with broad applications ranges in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature and Large&#8208;Polarization Ferroelectric with Second Harmonic Generation Response in a Novel Crown Ether Clathrate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular ferroelectrics of high&#8208;temperature reversible phase&#8208;transition are very rare and have attracted increasing attention in recent years. In this paper, we have successfully synthesized  a novel high&#8208;temperature host&#8208;guest inclusion ferroelectric: [  (C  6  H  5  NF  3  )  (18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][BF  4  ]  (1)  , which shows a pair of reversible peaks at 348 K (heating) and 331 K (cooling) with a heat hysteresis about 17 K by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements, indicating that  1  undergoes a reversible structural phase transition.  The variable&#8208;temperature PXRD and temperature&#8208;dependent dielectric measurements further prove the phase&#8208;transition behavior of  1  . The second harmonic response demonstrates that  1  belongs to a non&#8208;centrosymmetric space group at room temperature and is a good nonlinear optical material. Meanwhile,  1  shows a wide optical band gap of about 4.43 eV in semiconducting property and is chiefly contributed by C, H and O atoms of the crystals. In particular, the ferroelectric measurements of  1  exhibit a typical polarization&#8208;electric hysteresis loop with large spontaneous polarization (  P  s  ) of about 4.06  &#956;C/  cm  2  . This finding offers an alternative pathway for designing new ferroelectric&#8208;dielectric and nonlinear optical materials and related physical properties in organic&#8208; inorganic and other hybrid crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photo&#8208; and Redox&#8208;Driven Two&#8208;Directional Terthiazole&#8208;Based Switch: A Combined Experimental and Computational Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular switches are key elements for the design of stimuli&#8208;responsive systems and materials. Of particular interest are switches that can be fully operated both by light and electricity, the two most popular inputs. It is shown for the first time that a terarylene photoswitch can be effectively transformed to an efficient photo and redox one when decorated with the electroactive N&#8208;methyl pyridinium group. The driving forces behind different switching processes are revealed by a joint experimental and theoretical approach.







Abstract
Terthiazoles with redox&#8208;active substituents like an N&#8208;methyl pyridinium group and ferrocene have been synthesized and their photo&#8208; and electro&#8208;chromic behaviors were investigated. The presence of two lateral N&#8208;methyl pyridinium substituents in the structure of terthiazole proved to be effective in inducing not only the reductive ring&#8208;closure of the terthiazole core but also its oxidative ring&#8208;opening reaction, leading to the first terarylene&#8208;based switch able to fully operate both photochemically and electrochemically. Moreover, the large increase in the redox potential between its open and closed form (700&#8197;mV) means that a part of the photon energy necessary to trigger the cyclization is stored in the form of chemical potential available for other works. Introduction of a second redox&#8208;active unit such as ferrocene onto the central thiazolyl moiety is found to inhibit the photochromism of the switch but not its redox switchability, which, instead, got improved for the ring&#8208;opening reaction via the redox properties of the ferrocenyl unit. The optical and redox properties of the switch in its different oxidation states are analyzed with the aid of DFT calculations in order to rationalize different switching processes.

         <title>Zeolitic Vanadotungstates with Ultrahigh Porosities for Separation of Butane and Isobutane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zeolitic octahedral metal oxides based on vanadotungstates with different cations were successfully obtained and characterized. They efficiently separated n&#8208;butane from n&#8208;butane and i&#8208;butane mixtures. Single&#8208;gas adsorption measurements showed that the adsorbed volume of n&#8208;butane was much larger than that of i&#8208;butane. Breakthrough measurements showed that the materials efficiently achieved the separation of n&#8208;butane and i&#8208;butane, which was environmental friendly and cost&#8208;efficiently.







Abstract
Zeolitic vanadotungstates with tunable microporosity have potential interests in gas separation. The pore openings of the materials are in between the diameters of normal butane and isobutane, which causes the materials only adsorb normal butane. The breakthrough experiments show that the materials effectively separate normal butane from the normal butane and isobutane mixture even at high temperatures. The robust materials can be reused without loss of the separation performance.

         <title>Hydrogen and Halogen Bonding in Homogeneous External Electric Fields: Modulating the Bond Strengths</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent years have witnessed various fascinating phenomena arising from the interactions of noncovalent bonds with homogeneous external electric fields (EEFs). Here we performed a computational study to interpret the sensitivity of intrinsic bond strengths to EEFs in terms of steric effect and orbital interactions. The block&#8208;localized wavefunction (BLW) method, which combines the advantages of both  ab initio  valence bond (VB) theory and molecular orbital (MO) theory, and the subsequent energy decomposition (BLW&#8208;ED) approach were adopted. The sensitivity was monitored and analyzed using the induced energy term, which is the variation in each energy component along the EEF strength. Systems with single or multiple hydrogen (H) or halogen (X) bond(s) were also examined. It was found that the X&#8208;bond strength change EEFs mainly stems from the covalency change, while generally the steric effect rules the response of H&#8208;bonds to EEFs. Furthermore, X&#8208;bonds are more sensitive to EEFs, with the key difference between H&#8208; and X&#8208;bonds lying in the charge transfer interaction. Since phenylboronic acid has been experimentally used as a smart linker in EEFs, switchable sensitivity was scrutinized with the example of the phenylboronic acid dimer, which exhibits two conformations with either antiparallel or parallel H&#8208;bonds, thereby, opposite or consistent responses to EEFs. Among the studied systems, the quadruple X&#8208;bonds in molecular capsules exhibit remarkable sensitivity, with its interaction energy increased by &#8208;95.2 kJ/mol at the EEF strength 0.005 a.u..</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrodefluorination of Fluoroarenes Utilizing Amide Solvent as Reductant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free photoredox&#8208;catalyzed hydrodefluorination of fluoroarenes was realized by using N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;para&#8208;phenylenediamine as a catalyst under UV light irradiation. This reaction does not necessitate aliphatic amine additives as sacrificial reductants. The mechanistic studies indicated that the amide solvent NMP plays a critical role as a hydrogen and electron donor for this photoredox catalysis.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free photoredox&#8208;catalyzed hydrodefluorination of fluoroarenes was achieved by using N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;para&#8208;phenylenediamine (1) as a strong photoreduction catalyst. This reaction was applicable not only to electron&#8208;rich monofluoroarenes but also to polyfluoroarenes to afford non&#8208;fluorinated arenes. The experimental mechanistic studies indicated that the amide solvent NMP plays an important role for regeneration of the photocatalyst, enabling additive&#8208;free photoreduction catalysis.

         <title>Synthesis of Oligonucleotides Containing trans Mitomycin C DNA Adducts at N6 of Adenine and N2 of Guanine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mitomycin C, (MC), an antitumor drug, is a DNA alkylating agent currently used in the clinics. Inert in its native form, MC is reduced to reactive mitosenes which undergo nucleophilic attack by guanine or adenine bases in DNA to form monoadducts as well as interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). Although ICLs are considered the most cytotoxic lesions, the role of each individual adduct in the drug&#8217;s cytotoxicity is still not fully understood. Synthetic routes have been developed to access modified oligonucleotides containing dG MC&#8208;monoadducts and dG&#8208;MC&#8208;dG ICL at a single position of their base sequences to investigate the biological effects of these adducts. However, until now, oligonucleotides containing monoadducts formed by MC at the adenine base had not been&#160;available, thus preventing the examination of the role played by these lesions in the toxicity of MC. Here, we present a route to access these substrates. Structural proof of the adducted oligonucleotides were provided by enzymatic digestion to nucleosides and high resolution mass spectral analysis. Additionally, parent oligonucleotides containing a dG monoadduct and a dG&#8208;MC&#8208;dG ICL were also produced. The stability and physical properties of all substrates were compared  via  CD spectroscopy and UV melting temperature studies. Finally, virtual models were created to explore the conformational space and structural features of these MC&#8208;DNA complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Double&#8208;shelled Hollow SiO2@N&#8208;C Nanofiber Boosts the Lithium Storage Performance of [PMo12O40]3&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyoxometalates (POMs)&#8208;based materials, with high theoretical capacities and abundant reversible multi&#8208;electron redox properties, are considered as promising candidates in lithium&#8208;ion storage. However, the poor electronic conductivity, low specific surface area and high solubility in the electrolyte limited their practical applications. Herein, a double&#8208;shelled hollow PMo  12  &#8208;SiO  2  @N&#8208;C nanofiber (PMo  12  &#8208;SiO  2  @N&#8208;C, where PMo  12  is [PMo  12  O  40  ]  3&#8208;  , N&#8208;C is nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon) was fabricated for the first time by combining coaxial electrospinning technique, thermal treatment and electrostatic adsorption. As an anode material for LIBs, the PMo  12  &#8208;SiO  2  @N&#8208;C delivered an excellent specific capacity of 1641 mA h g  &#8208;1  after 1000 cycles under 2 A g  &#8208;1  . The excellent electrochemical performance benefit from the unique double&#8208;shelled hollow structure of the material, in which the outermost N&#8208;C shell cannot only hinder the agglomeration of PMo  12  , but also improve its electronic conductivity. The SiO  2  inner shell can efficiently avoid the loss of active components. The hollow structure can buffer the volume expansion accelerate Li  +  diffusion during lithiation/delithiation process. Moreover, PMo  12  can greatly reduce charge&#8208;resistance and facilitate electron transfer of the entire composites, as evidenced by the EIS kinetics study and lithium&#8208;ion diffusion analysis. This work paves the way for the fabrication of novel POM&#8208;based LIBs anode materials with excellent lithium storage performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Topological Transformation of Mg&#8208;containing Layered Double Hydroxide Nanosheets for Efficient Photo&#8208;driven CH4 Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct conversion of methane (CH  4  ) to fuels and other high value&#8208;added chemicals is an attractive technology in the chemical industry; however, practical challenges under sustainable process remain. Herein, we report the preparation of a heterostructured Co&#8208;doped MgO&#8208;based catalyst  via  topological transformation of a MgCo&#8208;layered double hydroxide (LDH) calcination from 200 to 1100  o  C. The catalyst can remarkably activate CH  4  coupling to produce C  2  H  6  with a selectivity of 41.60% within 3 h under a full&#8208;spectrum irradiation when calcination of LDH at 800  o  C. Characterization studies and catalytic results suggest that the highly dispersed active sites and large interfaces amongst the Co&#8208;doped MgO&#8208;based catalyst enable surface activation of CH  4  to methyl (CH  3  *), in turn promoting the coupling of CH  3  * to C  2  H  6  . This study introduces a promising pathway for the photo&#8208;driven CH  4  coupling to high value&#8208;added chemicals by using layered double hydroxides as a precursor.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Liquid crystalline polymer particles prepared by classical polymerization techniques are receiving increased attention as promising candidates for use in a variety of applications including micro&#8208;actuators, structurally colored objects, and absorbents. These particles have anisotropic molecular order and liquid crystalline phases that distinguish them from conventional polymer particles. In this minireview, the preparation of liquid crystalline polymer particles from classical suspension, (mini&#8208;)emulsion, dispersion, and precipitation polymerization reactions are discussed. The particle sizes, molecular orientations, and liquid crystalline phases produced by each technique are summarized and compared. We conclude with a discussion of the challenges and prospects of the preparation of liquid crystalline polymer particles by classical polymerization techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>Lithium Storage Mechanism Study of N&#8208;doped Carbon Modified Cu2S Electrodes for Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to the high specific capacity and abundant reserve, Cu  x  S compounds are promising electrode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Carbon compositing could stabilize Cu  x  S structure, and to repress capacity fading during the electrochemical cycling, but the corresponding Li  +  storage mechanism and stabilization effect should be further clarified. In this study, nanoscale Cu  2  S is synthesized via CuS co&#8208;precipitation and thermal reduction with polyelectrolytes. High&#8208;temperature synchrotron radiation diffraction is employed to monitor the thermal reduction process. During the first cycle, the conversion mechanism upon lithium storage in the Cu  2  S/carbon is elucidated by  operando  synchrotron radiation diffraction and  in situ  X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The N&#8208;doped carbon composited Cu  2  S (Cu  2  S/C) exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 425 mAh g  &#8211;1  at 0.1 A g  &#8211;1  , with the higher long&#8208;term capacity of 523 mAh g  &#8211;1  at 0.1 A g  &#8211;1  after 200 cycles, in contrast to the bare CuS electrode (123 mAh g  &#8211;1  after 200 cycles). Also, multiple&#8208;scan cyclic voltammetry proves that extra Li  +  storage is mainly ascribed to the contribution of the capacitive storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Potassium Ion Conductivity in the Cubic Labyrinth of a Piezoelectric, Antiferromagnetic Oxoferrate(III) Tellurate(VI)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Orange&#8208;colored crystals of the oxoferrate tellurate K  12+6x  Fe  6  Te  4&#8211;x  O  27  [  x  = 0.222(4)] were synthesized in a potassium hydroxide hydroflux with a molar water&#8208;base ratio  n  (H  2  O) :  n  (KOH) = 1.5 starting from Fe(NO  3  )  3  &#183;9H  2  O, TeO  2  and H  2  O  2  at about 200&#160;&#176;C. By using (NH  4  )  2  TeO  4  instead of TeO  2  , a fine powder consisting of microcrystalline spheres of K  12+6x  Fe  6  Te  4&#8211;x  O  27  was obtained. K  12+6x  Fe  6  Te  4&#8211;x  O  27  crystallizes in the acentric cubic space group . [Fe  III  O  5  ] pyramids share their apical atoms in [Fe  2  O  9  ] groups as well as two of their edges with [Te  VI  O  6  ] octahedra to form an open framework, which consists of two loosely connected but not interpenetrating chiral networks. The flexibility of the hinged oxometalate network manifests in a piezoelectric response similar as for LiNbO  3  .The potassium cations are mobile in channels, which run along the &lt;111&gt; directions and are crossing in cavities acting as nodes. The ion conductivity of cold&#8208;pressed pellets of ball&#8208;milled K  12+6x  Fe  6  Te  4&#8211;x  O  27  is 2.3&#183;10  &#8211;4  S&#183;cm  &#8211;1  at room&#8208;temperature. Magnetization measurements and neutron diffraction indicate antiferromagnetic coupling in the [Fe  2  O  9  ] groups.</dc:description>

By using (NH  4  )  2  TeO  4  instead of TeO  2  , a fine powder consisting of microcrystalline spheres of K  12+6x  Fe  6  Te  4&#8211;x  O  27  was obtained. K  12+6x  Fe  6  Te  4&#8211;x  O  27  crystallizes in the acentric cubic space group . [Fe  III  O  5  ] pyramids share their apical atoms in [Fe  2  O  9  ] groups as well as two of their edges with [Te  VI  O  6  ] octahedra to form an open framework, which consists of two loosely connected but not interpenetrating chiral networks. The flexibility of the hinged oxometalate network manifests in a piezoelectric response similar as for LiNbO  3  .The potassium cations are mobile in channels, which run along the &amp;lt;111&amp;gt; directions and are crossing in cavities acting as nodes. The ion conductivity of cold-pressed pellets of ball-milled K  12+6x  Fe  6  Te  4&#8211;x  O  27  is 2.3&#183;10  &#8211;4  S&#183;cm  &#8211;1  at room-temperature. Magnetization measurements and neutron diffraction indicate antiferromagnetic coupling in the [Fe  2  O  9  ] groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Halogen bonding Strapped Porphyrin BODIPY Rotaxanes for Dual Optical and Electrochemical Anion Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anion receptors employing two distinct sensory mechanisms are rare. Herein we report the first examples of halogen bonding porphyrin&#8208;BODIPY [2]rotaxanes capable of both fluorescent and redox electrochemical sensing of anions.  1  H NMR, UV/visible and electrochemical studies reveal rotaxane axle triazole group coordination to the zinc(II) metalloporphyrin containing macrocycle component, serves to preorganise the rotaxane binding cavity and dramatically enhance anion binding affinities. Mechanically bonded integrated axle BODIPY and macrocycle strapped metalloporphyrin motifs, enable the anion recognition event to be sensed  via  significant quenching of the BODIPY fluorophore and cathodic perturbations of the metalloporphyrin P/P  +&#8226;  redox couple.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Platinum Right Bipyramids by Separating and Controlling the Nucleation Step in a Continuous Flow System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Colloidal synthesis of metal nanocrystals with controlled shapes and internal structures calls for a tight control over both the nucleation and growth processes. Here we report a method for the facile synthesis of Pt right bipyramids (RBPs) by separating nucleation from growth and controlling the nucleation step in a continuous flow reactor. Specifically, homogeneous nucleation was thermally triggered by introducing the reaction solution into a tubular flow reactor held at an elevated temperature to generate singly&#8208;twinned seeds. At a lower temperature, the singly&#8208;twinned seeds were protected from oxidative etching to allow their slow growth and evolution into RBPs while additional nucleation of undesired seeds could be largely suppressed to ensure RBPs as the main product. Further investigation indicated that the internal structure and growth pattern of the seeds were determined by the temperatures used for the nucleation and growth steps, respectively. The Br  &#8208;  ions involved in the synthesis also played a critical role in the generation of RBPs by serving as a capping agent for the Pt{100} facets while regulating the reduction kinetics through coordination with the Pt(IV) ions.</dc:description>

         <title>Aminotroponiminates: Impact of the NO2 Functional Group on Coordination, Isomerisation, and Backbone Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aminotroponiminate (ATI) ligands are a versatile class of redox&#8208;active and potentially cooperative ligands with a rich coordination chemistry, which have consequently found a wide range of applications in synthesis and catalysis. While backbone substitution of these ligands has been investigated in some detail, the impact of electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the coordination chemistry and reactivity of ATIs is only little investigated. We report here Li, Na, and K salts of an ATI ligand with a nitro&#8208;substituent in the backbone. It is demonstrated that the NO  2  group actively contributes to the coordination chemistry of these complexes, effectively competing with the  N  ,  N  &#8208;binding pocket as a coordination site. This results in an unprecedented  E  /  Z  &#8208;isomerisation of an ATI imino group and culminates in the isolation of the first &#8220;naked&#8221; ATI anion (i.e. without directional bonding to a metal atom). Reactions of sodium ATIs with silver(I) and tritylium salts gave the first  N,N  coordinated silver ATI complexes and unprecedented backbone substitution reactions. Analytical techniques applied in this work include multinuclear (VT&#8208;)NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptides and nucleic acids can self&#8208;assemble to give supramolecular structures that find application in different fields, ranging from the delivery of drugs to the obtainment of materials endowed with optical properties. Forces that stabilize the &#8220;suprastructures&#8221; typically are hydrogen bonds or aromatic interactions; in case of nucleic acids, Watson&#8208;Crick pairing drives self&#8208;assembly while, in case of peptides, backbone hydrogen bonds and interactions between aromatic side chains trigger the formation of structures, such as nanotubes or ribbons. Molecules containing both aromatic peptides and nucleic acids could in principle exploit different forces to self&#8208;assemble. In this work we meant to investigate the self&#8208;assembly of mixed systems, with the aim to understand which forces play a major role and determine formation/structure of aggregates. We therefore synthesized conjugates of the peptide FF to the Peptide Nucleic Acid dimer &#8220;gc&#8221; and characterized their aggregates by different spectroscopic techniques, including NMR, CD and fluorescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient entropy&#8208;driven inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase III by hydroxyethylene transition state peptidomimetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dipeptidyl peptidase III (DPP3) is a ubiquitously expressed Zn&#8208;dependent protease, which plays an important role in regulating endogenous peptide hormones, such as enkephalins or angiotensins. In previous biophysical studies, we could show that substrate binding is driven by a large entropic contribution due to the release of water molecules from the closing binding cleft. Here, we report the design, synthesis and biophysical characterization of peptidomimetic inhibitors using for the first time an hydroxyethylene transition&#8208;state mimetic for a metalloprotease. Efficient routes for the synthesis of both stereoisomers of the pseudopeptide core were developed, which allowed the synthesis of peptidomimetic inhibitors mimicking the VVYPW&#8208;motif of tynorphin. The best inhibitors inhibit DPP3 in the low &#181;M range. Biophysical characterization by means of ITC measurement and X&#8208;ray crystallography confirm the unusual entropy&#8208;driven mode of binding. Stability assays demonstrated the desired stability of these inhibitors, which efficiently inhibited DPP3 in mouse brain homogenate.</dc:description>

The investigation of their physicochemical properties revealed the impact of C2&#8208;insertion into well&#8208;known carbazole electron&#8208;donors on the properties of previously reported twisted dibenzo[  a,j]phenazine&#8208;cored D&#8211;A&#8211;D triads. Slight structural modification caused a drastic change in conformational preference, allowing unique photophysical behavior of dual emission derived from room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence and triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation. Furthermore, the electrochemical analysis suggested the sigma&#8208;dimer formation and electrochemical polymerization on the electrode.

         <title>Carbon dioxide capture enhanced by pre&#8208;adsorption of water and methanol in UiO&#8208;66</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapidly rising level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere resulting from human activity is one of the greatest environmental problems facing our civilization today. Most technologies are not yet sufficiently developed to move existing infrastructure to cleaner alternatives. Therefore, techniques for capturing carbon dioxide from emission sources may play a key role at the moment. The structure of the UiO&#8208;66 material not only meets the requirement of high stability in contact with water vapor but through the water pre adsorbed in the pores, the selectivity of carbon dioxide adsorption is increased. We successfully applied the recently developed methodology for water adsorption modelling. It allowed to elucidate the influence of water on CO  2  adsorption and study the mechanism of this effect. We showed that water is adsorbed in octahedral cage and stands for promotor for CO  2  adsorption in less favorable space than tetrahedral cages. Water plays a role of a mediator of adsorption, what is a general idea of improving affinity of adsorbate. On the basis of pre&#8208;adsorption of methanol as another polar solvent, we have shown that the adsorption sites play a key role here, and not, as previously thought, only the interaction between the solvent and quadrupole carbon dioxide. Overall, we explained the mechanism of increased CO  2  adsorption in the presence of water and methanol, as polar solvents, in the UiO&#8208;66 pores for a potential post&#8208;combustion carbon dioxide capture application.</dc:description>

         <title>Ternary Conductance Switching Realized by a Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Functionalized Two&#8208;dimensional Imine Polymer Film</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nowadays, most manufacturing memory devices are based on materials with electrical bistability (i.e., &#8220;0&#8221; and &#8220;1&#8221;) in response to an applied electric field. Memory devices with multilevel states are highly desired to produce high&#8208;density and efficient memory devices. Herein, we report for the first time a multichannel strategy to realize ternary state memristor. We make use of the intrinsic subnanometer channel of pillar[5]arene and nanometer channel of two&#8208;dimensional imine polymer to construct an active layer with muiltilevel channels for ternary memory devices. Low threshold voltage, long retention time, clearly distinguishable resistance states, high ON/OFF ratio (OFF/ON1/ON2 = 1:10:10  3  ), and high ternary yield (75%) were obtained. In addition, the flexible memory device based on 2DP  TPAZ+TAPB  can maintain its stable ternary memory performance after bending for 500 times. The device also exhibits excellent thermal stability and can tolerate a high temperature of 300 &#176;C. The results in this work are envisioned to open up possibilities for multistate, flexible resistive memories with good thermal stability and low energy consumption and broaden the application of pillar[n]arene.</dc:description>

         <title>Static Retention of Dynamic Chiral Arrangement for Achiral Shear Thinning Metal Organic Colloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral compounds are known to be important not only because it is the fundamental component of living organism, but also for its unique chiroptical properties. In recent years, scientists have fabricated several chiral organic supramolecular aggregates by utilizing chiral physical field, such as vortex flow. Herein, the relationship between this dynamic chiroptical property and the rheological nature was discussed, suggesting the shear thinning property of non&#8208;Newton fluid may help the colloidal particles adopt the chiral arrangement in the vortex. Further, the storage modulus of colloids was increased by adding linking agent, which successfully kept the dynamic chiroptical property in the static state. Besides, the salt effect on the host&#8208;guest interaction involved in the colloids was studied, suggesting the significant enhancement of the transferred dynamic circular dichroism for the achiral guest molecule.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure and functional differences of cysteine and 3&#8208;mercaptopropionate dioxygenases. A computational study.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiol dioxygenases are important enzymes for human health involved in the detoxification and catabolism of toxic thiol&#8208;containing natural products such as cysteine, which has relevance to the development of Alzheimer&#8217;s and Parkinson&#8217;s diseases in the brain. Recent crystal structure coordinates of cysteine and 3&#8208;mercaptopropionate dioxygenase (CDO and MDO) showed major differences in the second&#8208;coordination spheres of the two enzymes. To understand the difference in activity between these two analogous enzymes, we created large active site cluster models. We show that CDO and MDO have different iron(III)&#8208;superoxo bound structures due to differences in ligand coordination. Furthermore, our studies show that the differences in the second&#8208;coordination sphere and particularly the position of a positively charged Arg residue results in changes of substrate positioning, mobility and enzymatic turnover. Furthermore, the substrate scope of MDO is explored with cysteinate and 2&#8208;mercaptosuccinic acid and their reactivity is predicted.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Sensitive Fluorescent pH Microsensors Based on the Ratiometric Dye Pyranine Immobilized on Silica Microparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a one&#8208;step synthesis, silica microparticles with efficiently immobilized pyranine (HPTS) dye gave extremely sensitive fluorescent ratiometric pH sensors. Immobilizing dye molecules on oppositely charged silica microparticles by using a positively charged silica shell preserves HPTS&#8242;S pH sensitivity, and also enhances the stability of the sensor particles. The effect of microparticle surface charge manipulation on enhancing the pH sensitivity without perturbing the stability and cytocompatibility is explored.







Abstract
Pyranine (HPTS) is a remarkably interesting pH&#8208;sensitive dye that has been used for plenty of applications. Its high quantum yield and extremely sensitive ratiometric fluorescence against pH change makes it a very favorable for pH&#8208;sensing applications and the development of pH nano&#8208;/microsensors. However, its strong negative charge and lack of easily modifiable functional groups makes it difficult to use with charged substrates such as silica. This study reports a methodology for noncovalent HPTS immobilization on silica microparticles that considers the retention of pH sensitivity as well as the long&#8208;term stability of the pH microsensors. The study emphasizes the importance of surface charge for governing the sensitivity of the immobilized HPTS dye molecules on silica microparticles. The importance of the immobilization methodology, which preserves the sensitivity and stability of the microsensors, is also assessed.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Bond Arylation of Cyclometalated Difluorinated 2&#8208;Arylisoquinolinyl Iridium(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalysis&#8208;on&#8208;the&#8208;complex was developed to incorporate diversely substituted aryl group on the ligands of neutral cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes. The regioselectivity of Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond arylation is not affected by C&#8722;Ir bond, as the reaction occurred at the C&#8722;H bond flanked by the two&#8208;fluorine atoms. All post&#8208;functionalized Ir(III) exhibit red phosphorescence with moderate to good efficiency.







Abstract
The utility of C&#8722;H bond functionalization of metalated ligands for the elaboration of aryl&#8208;functionalized difluorinated&#8208;1&#8208;arylisoquinolinyl Ir(III) complexes has been explored. Bis[(3,5&#8208;difluorophenyl)isoquinolinyl](2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;3,5&#8208;heptanedionato) iridium(III) undergoes Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond arylation with aryl bromides. The reaction regioselectively occurred at the C&#8722;H bond flanked by the two fluorine atoms of the difluoroaryl unit, and on both cyclometalated ligands. This post&#8208;functionalization gives a straightforward access to modified complexes in only one manipulation and allows to introduce thermally sensitive functional groups, such as trifluoromethyl, nitrile, benzoyl, or ester. The X&#8208;ray crystallography, photophysical, and electrochemical properties of the diarylated complexes were investigated. Whatever the nature of the incorporated substituted aryl groups is, all obtained complexes emit red phosphorescence (622&#8211;632&#8197;nm) with similar lifetimes (1.9&#8211;2&#8197;&#956;s).

         <title>Controlling Site&#8208;Directed RNA Editing by Chemically Induced Dimerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RNA editing: Site&#8208;directed adenosine&#8208;to&#8208;inosine RNA editing was engineered to be under control of the plant hormone gibberellic acid, applying the mechanism of chemically induced dimerization. Tight control and editing yields up to 44&#8201;% where achieved on endogenous targets in human cell culture.







Abstract
Various RNA&#8208;targeting approaches have been engineered to modify specific sites on endogenous transcripts, breaking new ground for a variety of basic research tools and promising clinical applications in the future. Here, we combine site&#8208;directed adenosine&#8208;to&#8208;inosine RNA editing with chemically induced dimerization. Specifically, we achieve tight and dose&#8208;dependent control of the editing reaction with gibberellic acid, and obtain editing yields up to 20&#8201;% and 44&#8201;% in the endogenous STAT1 and GAPDH transcript in cell culture. Furthermore, the disease&#8208;relevant MECP2 R106Q mutation was repaired with editing yields up to 42&#8201;%. The introduced principle will enable new applications where temporal or spatiotemporal control of an RNA&#8208;targeting mechanism is desired.

         <title>C&#8722;C Cross&#8208;couplings from a Cyclometalated Au(III) C^N complex: Mechanistic Insights and Synthetic Developments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, the reactivity of gold complexes was shown to extend well beyond&#160; p &#8208;activation and to holds promises to achieve selective cross&#8208;couplings in several C&#8211;C and C&#8211;E (E = heteroatom) bond forming reactions. Here, with the aim of exploiting new organometallic species for cross&#8208;coupling reactions, we report on the Au(III)&#8208;mediated C(sp  2  )&#8211;C(sp) occurring upon reaction of the cyclometalated complex [Au(C  CH2  N)Cl  2  ] (1, C  CH2  N = 2&#8208;benzylpyridine) with AgPhCC. The reaction progress has been monitored by NMR spectroscopy, demonstrating the involvement of a number of key intermediates, whose structures have been unambiguously ascertained&#160;  via  &#160;1D and 2D NMR analyses as well as by HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Furthermore, crystallographic studies have serendipitously resulted in the authentication of zwitterionic Au(I) complexes as side&#8208;products arising from cyclization of the coupling product in the coordination sphere of gold. The experimental work has been paralleled and complemented by DFT calculations of the reaction profiles, providing valuable insight into the structure and energetics of the key intermediates and transition states, as well as on the coordination sphere of gold along the whole process. Of note, the broader scope of the cross&#8208;coupling at the Au(III) C  CH2  N centre has also been demonstrated studying the reaction of&#160;1&#160;with C(sp  2  )&#8208;based nucleophiles, namely vinyl and heteroaryl tin and zinc reagents. These reactions stand as rare examples of C(sp  2  )&#8211;C(sp  2  ) cross&#8208;couplings at Au(III).</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we describe a gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization of Boc&#8208;protected benzylamines bearing two tethered alkyne moieties via a domino reaction initiated by a 6&#8208; endo&#8208;dig  cyclization. The reaction was screened intensively and the scope was explored, resulting in nine new Boc&#8208;protected dihydrobenzo[ c  ]phenanthridines with yields of up to 98%; even a &#960;&#8208;extension and two bidirectional approaches were successful. Furthermore, a thermal cleavage of the Boc&#8208;group and subsequent oxidation was possible to obtain substituted benzo[ c  ]phenanthridines in up to quantitative yields. Two bidirectional approaches were successful using the optimized conditions and the resulting &#960;&#8208;extended molecules were tested as organic semiconductors in organic thin&#8208;film transistors.</dc:description>

         <title>Mapping the Electronic Structure and the Reactivity Trends for Stabilized &#945;&#8208;Boryl Carbanions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbanion cartography: This study maps the stability/reactivity space for &#945;&#8208;boryl carbanions leading to the prediction of novel species. Free carbanionic intermediates can be described as borata&#8208;alkene species with a C&#8722;B &#960;&#8208;interaction strongly polarized towards the carbon, whereas multi&#8208;boryl species have very polar C&#8722;B bonds. Extensive analysis of &#945;&#8208;boryl alkylidene metal precursors identifies three structural patterns that can be related to reactivity.







Abstract
The chemistry of stabilized &#945;&#8208;boryl carbanions shows remarkable diversity, and can enable many different synthetic routes towards efficient C&#8722;C bond formation. The electron&#8208;deficient, trivalent boron center stabilizes the carbanion facilitating its generation and tuning its reactivity. Here, the electronic structure and the reactivity trends of a large dataset of &#945;&#8208;boryl carbanions are described. DFT&#8208;derived parameters were used to capture their electronic and steric properties, computational reactivity towards model substrates, and crystallographic analysis within the Cambridge Structural Dataset. This study maps the reactivity space by systematically varying the nature of the boryl moiety, the substituents of the carbanionic center, the number of &#945;&#8208;boryl motifs, and the metal counterion. In general, the free carbanionic intermediates are described as borata&#8208;alkene species with C&#8722;B &#960; interactions polarized towards the carbon. Furthermore, it was possible to classify the &#945;&#8208;boryl alkylidene metal precursors into three classes directly related to their reactivity: 1)&#8197;nucleophilic borata&#8208;alkene salts with alkali and alkaline earth metals, 2)&#8197;nucleophilic &#951;2&#8208;(C&#8722;B) borata&#8208;alkene complexes with early transition metals, Cu and Ag, and 3)&#8197;&#945;&#8208;boryl alkyl complexes with late transition metals. This trend map aids selection of the appropriate reactive synthon depending on the reactivity sought.

         <title>Peptide Cyclization Mediated by Metal&#8208;Free S&#8208;Arylation: S&#8208;Protected Cysteine Sulfoxide as an Umpolung of Cysteine Nucleophile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent linking of side chains provides a method to produce cyclic or stapling peptides that are important in developing peptide&#8208;based drugs. A variety of crosslinking formats contribute to fixing the active conformer and prolonging its biological activity under physiological conditions. One format uses the cysteine (Cys) thiol to participate in crosslinking through nucleophilic thiolate anions or thiyl radicals to form thioether and disulfide bonds. Removal of the S&#8208;protection from an S&#8208;protected Cys derivative generates the thiol which functions as a nucleophile. S&#8208;Oxidation of a protected Cys allows the formation of a sulfoxide that operates as an umpolung electrophile. Herein, the applicability of S&#8208;  p  &#8208;methoxybenzyl Cys sulfoxide (Cys(MBzl)(O)) to the formation of thioether linkage between tryptophan (Trp) and Cys has been investigated. The reaction of peptides containing Cys(MBzl)(O) and Trp with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMSA) or methanesulfonic acid (MSA) in TFA in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride (Gn&#183;HCl) proceeded to give cyclic or stapling peptides possessing the Cys&#8211;Trp thioether linkage. In this reaction, strong acids such as TFMSA or MSA are necessary to activate the sulfoxide. Additionally, Gn&#183;HCl plays a critical role in producing an electrophilic Cys derivative that combines with the indole by aromatic electrophilic substitution. The findings led us to conclude that the less electrophilic Cys(MBzl)(O) serves as an acid&#8208;activated umpolung of Cys nucleophile and is useful for S&#8208;arylation&#8208;mediated peptide cyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepwise stress&#8208;induced transformations of metal&#8208;organic polyhedral cluster&#8208;based assemblies: Where conformational and supramolecular features meet</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The understanding of factors governing the formation of supramolecular structures and phase transitions between various forms of molecular crystals is pivotal for developing dynamic, stimuli&#8208;responsive materials and polymorph&#8208;controlled syntheses. Here, we investigate the pressure&#8208;induced dynamic of both the intrinsic molecular structure and the supramolecular network of a predesigned polyhedral oxo&#8208;centered zinc cluster incorporating monoanionic N,N&#8217;&#8208;diphenylformamidinate and featuring the N&#8208;bonded phenyl groups in close proximity of the primary coordination sphere. We demonstrate that the model oxo cluster is prone to undergo pressure&#8208;induced conformational transformations of the secondary coordination sphere and simultaneous stepwise (initially every second polyhedral molecule undergoes the conformational transformations) and reversible transitions from an ambient phase &#945; to high&#8208;pressure phases &#946; and &#947;, as single crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single crystal events. The observed phase transitions nicely illustrate the key role of an interplay between low&#8208;energy conformational perturbations and cooperative intra&#8208; and intermolecular noncovalent interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>New Ideas for Understanding the Structure and Magnetism in AgF2: Prediction of Ferroelasticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the search for new high&#8208;temperature superconductors it has been proposed that there are strong similarities between the fluoroargentate AgF2  and the cuprate La2CuO4. As a novelty we explore the origin of the possible layered structure of AgF2  by studying its parent high&#8208;symmetry phase and comparing these results with those of a seemingly analogous cuprate, CuF2  . Our findings first stress the large differences between CuF2  and AgF2  . Indeed, the parent structure of AgF2  is found to be cubic, naturally devoid of any layering, even though Ag2+  ions occupy trigonal sites which, nevertheless, allow the existence of a Jahn&#8208;Teller effect. The observed Pbca orthorhombic phase is found when the system is cooperatively distorted by a local Exe trigonal Jahn&#8208;Teller effect around the silver sites that creates both the geometrical and magnetic layering. While the distortion implies that two Ag2+  &#8208;F&#8208;  bonds increase their distance by 15% and become softer, our simulations indicate that covalent bonding and interlayer electron hopping is strong, unlike the situation in cuprate superconductors and that, in fact, exfoliation of individual planes may be a harder task than previously suggested. As a salient feature, the present results prove that the actual magnetic structure in AgF2  is a direct consequence of vibronic contributions involved in the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect. Finally, our findings show that, due to the multiple minima intrinsic to the Jahn&#8208;Teller energy surface, the system is ferroelastic, a property that is strongly coupled to magnetism in this argentate.</dc:description>

         <title>Labeling and Probing the Silica Surface Using Mechanochemistry and 17O&#8197;NMR Spectroscopy**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast, user&#8208;friendly 17O enrichment approach by ball milling was developed to selectively enrich the surface of fumed silica. A variety of high&#8208;resolution solid&#8208;state 17O&#8197;NMR experiments (ultra&#8208;high magnetic field (35.2&#8197;T), 17O&#8197;MQMAS, 2D&#8197;17O&#8722;1H&#8197;D&#8208;HMQC, 17O&#8197;DNP), demonstrate that siloxane and different silanol bonds present at the surface, including H&#8208;bonded and isolated silanols, can be labeled and characterized in detail.







Abstract
In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing cost&#8208;efficient, fast, and user&#8208;friendly 17O enrichment protocols to help to understand the structure and reactivity of materials by using 17O&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. Here, we show for the first time how ball milling (BM) can be used to selectively and efficiently enrich the surface of fumed silica, which is widely used at industrial scale. Short milling times (up to 15&#8197;min) allowed modulation of the enrichment level (up to ca. 5&#8201;%) without significantly changing the nature of the material. High&#8208;precision 17O compositions were measured at different milling times by using large&#8208;geometry secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry (LG&#8208;SIMS). High&#8208;resolution 17O&#8197;NMR analyses (including at 35.2&#8197;T) allowed clear identification of the signals from siloxane (Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si) and silanols (Si&#8722;OH), while DNP analyses, performed by using direct 17O polarization and indirect 17O{1H}&#8197;CP excitation, agreed with selective labeling of the surface. Information on the distribution of Si&#8722;OH environments at the surface was obtained from 2D 1H&#8722;17O D&#8208;HMQC correlations. Finally, the surface&#8208;labeled silica was reacted with titania and using 17O DNP, their common interface was probed and Si&#8722;O&#8722;Ti bonds identified.

         <title>Humins with Efficient Electromagnetic Wave Absorption: A By&#8208;Product of Furfural Conversion to Isopropyl Levulinate via a Tandem Catalytic Reaction in One&#8208;Pot</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The by&#8208;product (called humins) is accompanied by a one&#8208;pot catalytic conversion reaction of furfural (FAL) to isopropyl levulinate (PL), which is carbonized (Humins&#8208;700) and applied to a new experiment of electromagnetic wave absorption, showing superior electromagnetic wave absorption performance. The minimum reflection loss (RLmin) value is &#8722;47.3 dB at 13.0 GHz with a thickness of 2.0&#8197;mm. This provides inspiration that humins can be applied to electromagnetic wave absorption.







Abstract
Both one&#8208;pot catalytic conversion of furfural (FAL) to isopropyl levulinate (PL) and carbonization of by&#8208;product (humins) for electromagnetic wave absorption are discussed, which provides inspiration that humins can be applied to electromagnetic wave absorption. In the former, phosphotungstic acid (PW) is employed as a homogeneous catalyst to convert FAL to PL via a tandem reaction in one pot, with the formation of a vast amount of humins. With FAL and various intermediates as substrates, it was found that humins was a polymerization product of FAL, furfuryl alcohol (FOL) and furfuryl ester (FE) with furan rings. In addition, the in&#8197;situ attenuated total reflection infrared (ATR&#8208;IR) spectra also provided a basis for the proposed reaction route. In the latter, with the humins as raw material, P species and WO3 doped nano&#8208;porous carbon (Humins&#8208;700) platform formed after high&#8208;temperature annealing is used for electromagnetic wave absorption and manifests desirable absorption performance. The minimum reflection loss (RLmin) value is &#8722;47.3 dB at 13.0 GHz with a thickness of 2.0&#8197;mm and the effective absorption bandwidth reaches 4.5 GHz (11.2&#8211;5.7 GHz).

         <title>Janus Pyrrolopyrrole Aza&#8208;dipyrrin: Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Assemblies and Slow Magnetic Relaxation of the Cobalt(II) Complex in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Look both ways after crossing: A pyrrolopyrrole azadipyrrin with a Janus duality (Janus&#8208;PPAD) resulting from the hydrogen&#8208;bonding ketopyrrole and metal&#8208;coordinating azadipyrrin moieties was synthesized by a Schiff base&#8211;forming reaction of diketopyrrolopyrrole and azaarylamine. In addition to the self&#8208;complementary assembly, the cobalt complex functions as a single&#8208;molecule magnet in the presence of a static magnetic field.







Abstract
A novel pyrrolopyrrole azadipyrrin (Janus&#8208;PPAD) with Janus duality was synthesized by a Schiff base&#8211;forming reaction of diketopyrrolopyrrole. The orthogonal interactions of the hydrogen&#8208;bonding ketopyrrole and metal&#8208;coordinating azadipyrrin moieties in Janus&#8208;PPAD enabled the metal ions to be arranged at regular intervals: zinc(II) and cobalt(II) coordination provided metal&#8208;coordinated Janus&#8208;PPAD dimers, which can subsequently form hydrogen&#8208;bonded one&#8208;dimensional arrays both in solution and in the solid state. The supramolecular assembly of the zinc(II) complex in solution was investigated by 1H NMR spectroscopy based on the isodesmic model, in which a binding constant for the elongation of assemblies is constant. Owing to the tetrahedral coordination, in the solid state, the cobalt(II) complex exhibited a slow magnetic relaxation due to the negative D value of &#8722;27.1&#8197;cm&#8722;1 with an effective relaxation energy barrier Ueff of 38.0&#8197;cm&#8722;1. The effect of magnetic dilution on the relaxation behavior is discussed. The relaxation mechanism at low temperature was analyzed by considering spin lattice interactions and quantum tunneling effects. The easy&#8208;axis magnetic anisotropy was confirmed, and the relevant wave functions were obtained by ab initio CASSCF calculations.

         <title>Photoredox Catalysis Using Heterogenized Iridium Complexes**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogenized iridium catalysts were synthesized to generate reusable, robust photoredox catalysts. The catalyst architecture, in nanopowder or thin film forms, was studied to see how it affected the catalytic performance on three different metal oxide surfaces. Reductive dehalogenation of bromoacetophenone to acetophenone was studied as the model photoredox reaction, and all catalysts showed successful product generation. Al2O3&#8208;based catalysts were found to be the most robust and reusable catalysts in both architectures, with at least &#8764;1000 turnovers and reusable three times.







Abstract
Heterogenized photoredox catalysts provide a path for sustainable chemical synthesis using highly tunable, reusable constructs. Here, heterogenized iridium complexes as photoredox catalysts were assembled via covalent attachment to metal oxide surfaces (ITO, ZrO2, Al2O3) in thin film or nanopowder constructs. The goal was to understand which materials provided the most promising constructs for catalysis. To do this, reductive dehalogenation of bromoacetophenone to acetophenone was studied as a test reaction for system optimization. All catalyst constructs produced acetophenone with high conversions and yields with the fastest reactions complete in fifteen minutes using Al2O3 supports. The nanopowder catalysts resulted in faster and more efficient catalysis, while the thin film catalysts were more robust and easily reused. Importantly, the thin film constructs show promise for future photoelectrochemical and electrochemical photoredox setups. Finally, all catalysts were reusable 2&#8211;3 times, performing at least 1000 turnovers (Al2O3), demonstrating that heterogenized catalysts are a sustainable catalyst alternative.

         <title>Factors Controlling the Aluminum(I)&#8208;meta&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Activation in Arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The factors controlling the so&#8208;far poorly understood complete meta&#8208;selectivity observed in the C&#8722;H activation reactions of alkylarenes promoted by different aluminyl anions are revealed by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computational methods.







Abstract
The so far poorly understood factors controlling the complete meta&#8208;selectivity observed in the C&#8722;H activation reactions of alkylarenes promoted by aluminyl anions have been explored in detail by means of Density Functional Theory calculations. To this end, a combination of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computational methods, namely the activation strain model of reactivity and energy decomposition analysis, has been applied to quantitatively unveil the origin of the selectivity of the transformation as well as the influence of the associated potassium cation. It is found that the selectivity takes place during the initial nucleophilic addition step where the key LP(Al)&#8594;&#960;*(C=C) molecular orbital interaction is more stabilizing for the meta&#8208;pathway, which results in a stronger interaction between the reactants along the entire transformation.

         <title>Structural Transformation of Surface&#8208;Confined Porphyrin Networks by Addition of Co Atoms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural transformation of a porphyrin&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional network from its H&#8208;bonded phase to a porous metal&#8208;coordinated phase after the addition of Co&#8208;atoms on Au(111) under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions was inverstigated. The networks were characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy, low&#8208;energy electron diffraction and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of a nickel&#8208;porphyrin derivative (Ni&#8208;DPPyP) containing two pyridyl coordinating sites and two pentyl chains at trans meso positions was studied with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED) on Au(111). Deposition of Ni&#8208;DPPyP onto Au(111) gave rise to a close&#8208;packed network for coverages smaller or equal to one monolayer as revealed by STM and LEED. The molecular arrangement of this two&#8208;dimensional network is stabilized via hydrogen bonds formed between the pyridyl's nitrogen and hydrogen atoms from the pyrrole groups of neighboring molecules. Subsequent deposition of cobalt atoms onto the close&#8208;packed network and post&#8208;deposition annealing at 423&#8197;K led to the formation of a Co&#8208;coordinated hexagonal porous network. As confirmed by XPS measurements, the porous network is stabilized by metal&#8208;ligand interactions between one cobalt atom and three pyridyl ligands, each pyridyl ligand coming from a different Ni&#8208;DPPyP molecule.

         <title>Controlling Antibacterial Activity Exclusively with Visible Light: Introducing a Tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;Chloro&#8208;Azobenzene Amino Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photoswitchable amino acid has provided access to tyrocidine&#8197;A analogues fully operated under visible light. This has led to linear analogues that have shown good photoswitchability and strain selectivity against A. baumannii and S. pyogenes clinical strains by using different analogues. Activated cis compounds turn back to their deactivated trans form upon short exposure times to sunlight, paving the way to self&#8208;deactivating antibacterials with minor evolutionary pressure on the environment.







Abstract
The introduction of a novel tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;chloroazobenzene amino acid (CEBA) has enabled photoswitching of the antimicrobial activity of tyrocidine&#8197;A analogues by using exclusively visible light, granting spatiotemporal control under benign conditions. Compounds bearing this photoswitchable amino acid become active upon irradiation with red light, but quickly turn&#8208;off upon exposure to other visible light wavelengths. Critically, sunlight quickly triggers isomerisation of the red light&#8208;activated compounds into their original trans form, offering an ideal platform for self&#8208;deactivation upon release into the environment. Linear analogues of tyrocidine&#8197;A were found to provide the best photocontrol of their antimicrobial activity, leading to compounds active against Acinetobacter baumannii upon isomerisation. Exploration of their N&#8208; and C&#8208;termini has provided insights into key elements of their structure and has allowed obtaining new antimicrobials displaying excellent strain selectivity and photocontrol.

This has led to linear analogues that have shown good photoswitchability and strain selectivity against &lt;i&gt;A. baumannii&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S. pyogenes&lt;/i&gt; clinical strains by using different analogues. Activated &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; compounds turn back to their deactivated &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; form upon short exposure times to sunlight, paving the way to self-deactivating antibacterials with minor evolutionary pressure on the environment.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction of a novel tetra-&lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-chloroazobenzene amino acid (CEBA) has enabled photoswitching of the antimicrobial activity of tyrocidine&#8197;A analogues by using exclusively visible light, granting spatiotemporal control under benign conditions. Compounds bearing this photoswitchable amino acid become active upon irradiation with red light, but quickly turn-off upon exposure to other visible light wavelengths. Critically, sunlight quickly triggers isomerisation of the red light-activated compounds into their original &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; form, offering an ideal platform for self-deactivation upon release into the environment. Linear analogues of tyrocidine&#8197;A were found to provide the best photocontrol of their antimicrobial activity, leading to compounds active against &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt; upon isomerisation. Exploration of their &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-termini has provided insights into key elements of their structure and has allowed obtaining new antimicrobials displaying excellent strain selectivity and photocontrol.&lt;/p&gt;

Fine tunable Pd8 chains supported by linear tetraphosphine (meso&#8208;dpmppm), [Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(L)2]4+ (L=none (1), solvent (2), RNC (3)) and [Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(X)2]2+ (X&#8722;=(pseudo)halide (4)) were systematically synthesized and exhibited wide range redox behaviors from {Pd4}4+ to {Pd4}0 through {Pd8}4+, {Pd8}3+, and {Pd8}2+ strings and led by treatment with bisisocyanide (BI) in CH3CN to dynamical 1D assembly of {[Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(BI)](BF4)4}n.







Abstract
A series of the octapalladium chains supported by meso&#8208;Ph2PCH2P(Ph)CH2P(Ph)CH2PPh2 (meso&#8208;dpmppm) ligands, [Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(L)2](BF4)4 (L=none (1), solvents: CH3CN (2&#8201;a), dmf (2&#8201;b), dmso (2&#8201;c), RN&#8801;C: R=Xyl (3&#8201;a), Mes (3&#8201;b), Dip (3&#8201;c), tBu (3&#8201;d), Cy (3&#8201;e), CH3(CH2)7 (3&#8201;f), CH3(CH2)11 (3&#8201;g), CH3(CH2)17 (3&#8201;h)) and [Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(X)2](BF4)2 (X=Cl (4&#8201;a), N3 (4&#8201;b), CN (4&#8201;c), SCN (4&#8201;d)), were synthesized by using 2&#8201;a as a stable good precursor, and characterized by spectroscopic (IR, 1H and 31P&#8197;NMR, UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR, ESI&#8208;MS) measurements and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses (for 1, 2&#8201;a,&#8201;b, 3&#8201;a,&#8201;b,&#8201;e,&#8201;f, 4&#8201;a&#8211;d). On the basis of DFT calculations on the X&#8208;ray determined structure of 2&#8201;b ([2b&#8208;Pd8]4+) and the optimized models [Pd8(meso&#8208;Ph2PCH2P(H)CH2P(H)CH2PH2)4(CH3CN)2]4+ ([Pd8Ph8]4+) and [Pd8(meso&#8208;H2PCH2P(H)CH2P(H)CH2PH2)4(CH3CN)2]4+ ([Pd8H8]4+), with and without empirically calculating dispersion force stabilization energy (B3LYP&#8208;D3, B3LYP), the formation energy between the two Pd4 fragments is assumed to involve mainly noncovalent interactions (ca. &#8722;70&#8197;kcal/mol) with four sets of interligand C&#8722;H/&#960; interactions and Pd&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pd metallophilic one, while electron shared covalent interactions are almost canceled out within the Pd8 chain. All the compounds isolated are stable in solution and exhibit characteristic absorption at &#8764;900&#8197;nm, which is assignable to a spin allowed HOMO to LUMO transition, and shows temperature dependent intensity change with variable absorption coefficients presumably due to coupling with some thermal vibrations. The structures and electronic states of the Pd8 chains are found finely tunable by varying the terminal capping ligands. In particular, theoretical calculations elucidated that the HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap is systematically related to the central Pd&#8722;Pd distance (2.7319(6)&#8211;2.7575(6)&#8197;&#197;) by two ways with neutral ligands L (1, 2, 3) and with anionic ligands X (4), which are reflected on the NIR absorption energy of 867&#8211;954&#8197;nm. The isocyanide terminated Pd8 complexes (3) further reacted with excess of RNC (6 eq) to afford the Pd4 complexes, [Pd4(meso&#8208;dpmppm)2(RNC)2](BF4)2 (13), and the cyclic voltammograms of 2&#8201;a (L=CH3CN), 3, and 13 (R=Xyl, Mes, tBu, Cy) demonstrated wide range redox behaviors from 2{Pd4}4+ to 2{Pd4}0 through 2{Pd4}2+&#8596;{Pd8}4+, {Pd8}3+, and {Pd8}2+ strings. The oxidized complexes, [Pd4(meso&#8208;dpmppm)2(RNC)3](BF4)4 (16), were characterized by X&#8208;ray analyses, and the two&#8208;electron reduced chain of [Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4](BF4)2 (7) was analyzed by spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques and DFT calculations. Reactions of 2&#8201;a with 1&#8197;equiv. of aromatic linear bisisocyanide (BI) in CH2Cl2 deposited insoluble coordination polymers, {[Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(BI)](BF4)4}n (5), and interestingly, they were soluble in acetonitrile, 31P{1H} and 1H&#8197;DOSY NMR spectra as well as SAXS curves suggesting that the coordination polymers may exist in acetonitrile as dynamically 1D self&#8208;assembled coordination polymers comprising ca. 50&#8197;units of the Pd8 rod averaged within the timescale.

         <title>Nitric Oxide Photoreleasers with Fluorescent Reporting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tracking your delivery: Molecular constructs are able to combine light&#8208;regulated release of nitric oxide (NO) with fluorescent reporting functionality to track and quantify in real time the amount of NO delivered, even in complex biological environments, are described, highlighting the logical design and their potential therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) plays a multifaceted role in human physiology and pathophysiology, and its controlled delivery has great prospects in therapeutic applications. The light&#8208;activated uncaging of NO from NO caging compounds allows this free radical to be released with accurate control of site and dosage, which strictly determine its biological effects. Molecular constructs able to activate fluorescence concomitantly to NO release offer the important advantage of easy and real&#8208;time tracking of the amount of NO uncaged in a non&#8208;invasive fashion even in the cell environment.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tracking your delivery&lt;/b&gt;: Molecular constructs are able to combine light-regulated release of nitric oxide (NO) with fluorescent reporting functionality to track and quantify in real time the amount of NO delivered, even in complex biological environments, are described, highlighting the logical design and their potential therapeutic applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitric oxide (NO) plays a multifaceted role in human physiology and pathophysiology, and its controlled delivery has great prospects in therapeutic applications. The light-activated uncaging of NO from NO caging compounds allows this free radical to be released with accurate control of site and dosage, which strictly determine its biological effects. Molecular constructs able to activate fluorescence concomitantly to NO release offer the important advantage of easy and real-time tracking of the amount of NO uncaged in a non-invasive fashion even in the cell environment. This contribution provides an overview of the advances in photoactivatable NO releasers bearing fluorescent reporting functionalities achieved in our and other laboratories, highlighting the rationale design and their potential therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Remodeling of the Fibrillation Pathway of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein by Interaction with Antimicrobial Peptide LL&#8208;III</title>

Avoiding fibrils: The cationic antimicrobial peptide LL&#8208;III stabilizes droplet condensates formed by &#945;&#8208;synuclein, thereby impeding their transformation to the fibrillar amyloid state.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) has emerged as a key mechanism for intracellular organization, and many recent studies have provided important insights into the role of LLPS in cell biology. There is also evidence that LLPS is associated with a variety of medical conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders. Pathological aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, which is causally linked to Parkinson's disease, can proceed via droplet condensation, which then gradually transitions to the amyloid state. We show that the antimicrobial peptide LL&#8208;III is able to interact with both monomers and condensates of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, leading to stabilization of the droplet and preventing conversion to the fibrillar state. The anti&#8208;aggregation activity of LL&#8208;III was also confirmed in a cellular model. We anticipate that studying the interaction of antimicrobial&#8208;type peptides with liquid condensates such as &#945;&#8208;synuclein will contribute to the understanding of disease mechanisms (that arise in such condensates) and may also open up exciting new avenues for intervention.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Substituted Tetrahydrofurans via Palladium/Rhodium Synergistic Catalyzed [3+2] Decarboxylative Cycloaddition of Vinylethylene Carbonates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multimetallic cooperative catalysis represents one of the most efficient method for asymmetric C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bond forming transformations. An enantioselective [3+2] cycloaddition reaction catalyzed synergistically by the combination of an achiral palladium catalyst and a chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal rhodium(III) complex has been developed, generating a series of 1,2,3,3&#8208;tetrasubstituted tetrahydrofurans in high yields and stereoselectivities (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 d.r., up to 99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Unlike the comprehensive development of tandem multi&#8208;metallic catalysis, bimetallic synergistic catalysis has been challenging to achieve high stereoselectivity with the generation of multi&#8208;stereogenic centers. Herein, an efficient synergistic catalysis for the diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted tetrahydrofuran derivatives has been developed. Under mild reaction conditions, a series of target molecules with three consecutive stereocenters were synthesized by a palladium(0)/rhodium(III) bimetal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric decarboxylative [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of vinylethylene carbonates with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The corresponding adducts were obtained with moderate to high yields (67&#8201;%&#8764;98&#8201;%) and excellent stereoselectivities (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 d.r., up to 99&#8201;% ee).

         <dc:description>
A versatile approach towards 2,9&#8208;diazadibenzoperylenes (DDPs) and related 2,9&#8208;dimethyldibenzoperylenes (DBPs) with various C, O, and N substituents in 1,3,8,10&#8208;positions is presented. It comprises reductive aromatization of PTCDI via O&#8208;silylation and O&#8208;trifylation steps. DDP&#8208;tetratriflate is the strategic key to (hetero)aryl, alkynyl, aminyl or O&#8208;phosphanyl DDPs characterized by UV/Vis/PL spectra, XRD and CV methods and (TD&#8208;)DFT calculations.







Abstract
The synthesis of 2,9&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3,8,10&#8208;tetratriflato&#8208;dibenzoperylene (DDP 3&#8201;a) and corresponding 2,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3,8,10&#8208;tetratriflato&#8208;dibenzoperylene (DBP 3&#8201;b) has been developed at multigram scale via reduction of one of the industrially most important high&#8208;performance dyes, perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI), and of the corresponding dihydroxy peropyrenequinone precursor. The focus of this paper is on the reactivity pattern of 3&#8201;a as key intermediate towards highly functionalized 2,9&#8208;diazadibenzopyrelenes (DDPs) obtained via catalytic substitution of four triflate by aryl, heteroaryl, alkynyl, aminyl, and O&#8208;phosphanyl substituents. The influence of electron&#8208;donating substituents (OSiMe3, OPt&#8208;Bu2, N&#8208;piperidinyl), electron&#8208;withdrawing (OTf, 3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;phenyl), and of electron&#8208;rich &#960;&#8208;conjugated (2&#8208;thienyl, 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl, trimethylsilyl&#8208;ethynyl) substituents on optoelectronic and structural properties of these functionalized DDPs has been investigated via XRD analyses, UV/Vis, PL spectroscopy, and by electroanalytical CV. These results were correlated to results of DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations. Thus, functionalized DPPs with easily tunable HOMO and LUMO energies and gap became available via a new and reliable synthetic strategy starting from readily available PTCDI.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;temperature aminolytic route was designed to synthesize sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (CFO NPs) with good dispersion through carefully exploiting the reaction of acetates and oleylamine (OAm). The well&#8208;dispersed 9.1&#8197;nm CFO NPs prepared by the aminolytic method exhibited excellent reversible capacity and superior cycling stability compared with those prepared by co&#8208;precipitation method, and the performance could be further enhanced when the size of nanoparticles decreased to 3.4&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Spinel ferrites are promising anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) owing to their high theoretical specific capacities. However, their practical application is impeded by inherent low conductivity and severe volume expansion, which can be surpassed by increasing the surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio of nanoparticles. Currently, most methods produce spinel ferrite nanoparticles with large size and severe aggregation, degrading their electrochemical performance. In this study, a low&#8208;temperature aminolytic route was designed to synthesize sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm CoFe2O4 nanoparticles with good dispersion through carefully exploiting the reaction of acetates and oleylamine. The performance of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles obtained by a traditional co&#8208;precipitation method was also investigated for comparison. This work demonstrates that CoFe2O4 nanoparticles synthesized by the aminolytic route are promising as anode materials for LIBs. Besides, this method can be extended to design other spinel ferrites for energy storage devices with superior performance by simply changing the starting material, such as MnFe2O4, MgFe2O4, ZnFe2O4, and so on.

         <title>First Synthesis of the Inherently Chiral Trans&#8208;4' Bisadduct of C59N Azafullerene Using Cyclo&#8208;[2]&#8208;dodecylmalonate as Tether</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiaddition chemistry of azafullerene C  59  N has been scarcely explored and the isolation of pure bisadducts is in its infancy. Encouraged by the recent regioselective synthesis of the inherently chiral  equatorial  face  bisadduct of C  59  N, we focused on the isolation of the first  trans&#8208;  4 bisadduct, via a simple two&#8208;step approach. The first regioselective synthesis of the  trans&#8208;  4 bisadduct of C  59  N utilizing  cyclo&#8208;  [2]&#8208;dodecylmalonate as tether is now reported. The newly synthesized bisadduct has a  C  1  symmetry as evidenced by  13  C NMR, while X&#8208;ray crystallography validated the  trans&#8208;  4' addition pattern. Furthermore, the inherently chiral  trans&#8208;  4' C  59  N bisadduct was enantiomerically resolved and the mirror&#8208;image relation of the two enantiomers was probed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Finally, UV&#8208;Vis and redox assays suggested that the addition pattern has a reflection in the light&#8208;harvesting and redox properties of the bisadduct.</dc:description>

         <title>Canopy Catalysts for Alkyne Metathesis: Investigations into a Bimolecular Decomposition Pathway and the Stability of the Podand Cap</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molybdenum alkylidyne complexes with a trisilanolate podand ligand framework (&#8220;canopy catalysts&#8221;) are the arguably most selective catalysts for alkyne metathesis known to date. Among them, complex  1a  endowed with a fence of lateral methyl substituents on the silicon linkers is most reactive, although fairly high loadings are required in certain applications. It is now shown that this catalyst decomposes readily via a bimolecular pathway, which engages the Mo&#186;CR entities in a stoichiometric triple bond metathesis event to furnish RC&#186;CR and the corresponding dinuclear complex  8  with a Mo&#186;Mo core. In addition to the regular analytical techniques,  95  Mo NMR was used to confirm this unusual outcome. This rapid degradation mechanism is largely avoided by increasing the size of the peripheral substituents on silicon, without unduly compromising the activity of the resulting complexes. When chemically challenged, however, canopy catalysts can open the apparently somewhat strained tripodal ligand cages; this reorganization leads to the formation of cyclo&#8208;tetrameric arrays composed of four metal alkylidyne units linked together via one silanol arm of the ligand backbone. The analogous tungsten alkylidyne complex  6  endowed with a tripodal tris&#8208;alkoxide (rather than siloxide) ligand framework is even more susceptible to such a controlled and reversible cyclo&#8208;oligomerization. The structures of the resulting giant macrocyclic ensembles were established by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>

         <title>Determining the Diastereoselectivity of the Formation of Dipeptidonucleotides by NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteins are composed of l&#8208;amino acids, but nucleic acids and most oligosaccharides contain d&#8208;sugars as building blocks. It is interesting to ask whether this is a coincidence or a consequence of the functional interplay of these biomolecules. One reaction that provides an opportunity to study this interplay is the formation of phosphoramidate&#8208;linked peptido RNA from amino acids and ribonucleotides in aqueous condensation buffer. Here we report how the diastereoselectivity of the first peptide coupling of the peptido RNA pathway can be determined in situ by NMR spectroscopy. When a racemic mixture of an amino acid ester was allowed to react with an 5'&#8208;aminoacidyl nucleotide, diastereomeric ratios of up to 72:28 of the resulting dipeptido nucleotides were found by integration of 31P&#8208; or 1H&#8208;NMR peaks. The highest diastereomeric excess was found for the homochiral coupling product d&#8208;Ser&#8208;d&#8208;Trp, phosphoramidate&#8208;linked to adenosine 5'&#8208;monophosphate with its d&#8208;ribose ring. When control reactions with an N&#8208;acetyl amino acid and valine methyl ester were run in organic solvent, the diastereoselectivity was found to be lower, with diastereomeric ratios &#8804; 62:38. The results from the exploratory study thus indicate that the ribonucleotide residue not only facilitates the coupling of lipophilic amino acids in aqueous medium but also the formation of a homochiral dipeptide. The methodology described here may be used to search for other stereoselective reactions that shed light on the origin of homochirality.</dc:description>

         <title>Combined Chemical Modification and Collision Induced Unfolding Using Native Ion Mobility&#8208;mass Spectrometry Provides Insights into Protein Gas&#8208;phase Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Native mass spectrometry is now an important tool in structural biology. Thus, the nature of higher protein structure in the vacuum of the mass spectrometer is an area of significant interest. One of the major goals in the study of gas&#8208;phase protein structure is to elucidate the stabilising role of interactions at the level of individual amino acid residues. A strategy combining protein chemical modification together with collision induced unfolding (CIU) was developed and employed to probe the structure of compact protein ions produced by native electrospray ionisation. Tractable chemical modification was used to alter the properties of amino acid residues, and&#160; ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS) utilised to monitor the extent of unfolding as a function of modification. From these data the importance of specific intramolecular interactions for the stability of compact gas&#8208;phase protein structure can be inferred. Using this approach, and aided by molecular dynamics simulations, an important stabilising interaction between K6 and H68 in the protein ubiquitin was identified, as was a contact between the N&#8208;terminus and E22 in a ubiquitin binding protein UBA2.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Native mass spectrometry is now an important tool in structural biology. Thus, the nature of higher protein structure in the vacuum of the mass spectrometer is an area of significant interest. One of the major goals in the study of gas-phase protein structure is to elucidate the stabilising role of interactions at the level of individual amino acid residues. A strategy combining protein chemical modification together with collision induced unfolding (CIU) was developed and employed to probe the structure of compact protein ions produced by native electrospray ionisation. Tractable chemical modification was used to alter the properties of amino acid residues, and&#160; ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) utilised to monitor the extent of unfolding as a function of modification. From these data the importance of specific intramolecular interactions for the stability of compact gas-phase protein structure can be inferred. Using this approach, and aided by molecular dynamics simulations, an important stabilising interaction between K6 and H68 in the protein ubiquitin was identified, as was a contact between the N-terminus and E22 in a ubiquitin binding protein UBA2.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Water Molecule Triggers Guest Exchange at a Mono&#8208;zinc Centre Confined in a Biomimetic Calixarene Pocket: a Model for Understanding Ligand Stability in Zn Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, the ligand exchange mechanism at a biomimetic Zn  II  centre, embedded in a pocket mimicking the possible constrains induced by a proteic structure, is explored. The residence time of different guest ligands (dimethylformamide, acetonitrile and ethanol) inside the cavity of a calix[6]arene&#8208;based tris(imidazole) tetrahedral zinc complex was probed using 1D EXchange SpectroscopY NMR experiments. A strong dependence of residence time on water content was observed with no exchange occurring under anhydrous conditions, even in the presence of a large excess of guest ligand. These results advocate for an associative exchange mechanism involving the transient exo&#8208;coordination of a water molecule, giving rise to 5&#8208;coordinate Zn  II  intermediates, and inversion of the pyramid at the Zn  II&#160;  centre. Theoretical modelling by DFT confirmed that the associative mechanism is at stake. These results are particularly relevant in the context of the understanding of kinetic stability/lability in Zn proteins and highlight the key role that a single water molecule can play in catalysing ligand exchange and controlling the lability of Zn.</dc:description>
