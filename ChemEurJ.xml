         <title>What Makes a Branched Aromatic Compound a Crystallization Chaperone? Insights from a Comparison of Three Organic Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability to accommodate guest molecules of many different shapes in crystal lattices has been tested for teraaryl derivatives of porphyrin, spirobifluorene, and adamantane. The latter appears to offer the most favorable properties, which may be at least partially due to low activation barriers for the interconversion of rotamers.








Abstract
Some tetraaryladamantane (TAA) octa&#8208; and tetraethers have the ability to crystallize into well&#8208;ordered lattices without full desolvation. In many cases, the solvates then yield high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray crystal structures of the encapsulated liquids. To shed light on this unusual effect of TAAs as crystallization chaperones, we have synthesized a series of spirobiflourene and porphyrin derivatives with four phenyl arms also found in TAA chaperones. Despite the structural similarity, neither of the non&#8208;TAA compounds showed promising crystallization properties. Six new X&#8208;ray crystal structures were obtained, but neither gave a high&#8208;resolution structure of an encapsulated guest. Quantum chemical computations suggest that conformational changes have low activation barriers for the TAAs, which may help to adapt to the structures of guest molecules in tightly packed arrangements. These findings on supramolecular chemistry in the crystalline state may help to design new chaperones with improved properties.

         <title>Microwave Radiation for Organolithium Chemistry: Mechanistic Studies on the Direct &#945;&#8208;Metalation of a Tertiary Amine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the use of microwave radiation to lithium chemistry, specifically in the kinetically hindered deprotonation of a tertiary amine at high temperatures without polar additives. The amine acts as substrate and deaggregation agent as shown by a solid&#8208;state structure. The lithium compounds remain stable at the harsh conditions and the deprotonated amine is storage&#8208;stable, facilitating diverse follow&#8208;up chemistry.








Abstract
Deprotonation reactions with lithium alkyls exhibit a high temperature dependency. However, the reactivity of lithium alkyls with conventionally used Lewis bases limits their deprotonation capability of more challenging substrates like tertiary amines. Therefore, we have focused on the use of high but exactly set reaction temperatures by usage of microwave radiation in the deprotonation reaction of a tertiary amine in the absence of polar additives. Our study proves the robustness of lithium alkyls, like t&#8208;butyllithium and &#945;&#8208;metalated tertiary amines under microwave conditions. A solid&#8208;state structure of the prelithiation aggregate and quantum chemical calculations offer an insight into the mechanism, revealing that the substrate amine performs as Lewis base for deaggregation itself. By our method, N&#8208;methylpiperidine was deprotonated without any intermediate or possibly toxic reaction steps, solvents, or additives, solely with t&#8208;butyllithium in the microwave with 56% yield. By using design of experiments we identified the most important factors for a successful deprotonation, revealing the closed reaction conditions under pressure and an excess of amine to be crucial. This investigation proves the high potential of microwave radiation in lithium chemistry, as it provides high but exact energy and introduces new possibilities for deprotonation reactions to overcome high kinetic reaction barriers.

         <title>Naming Matters: Hydridic Hydrogen Atoms are Halogen, Chalcogen, and Pnictogen Bond Acceptors not &#8220;Hydridic Hydrogen Bond&#8221; Donors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydridic hydrogen atoms (e.g., in Me3Ge&#9472;H) form directional noncovalent interactions with electrophilic Br, Se, and As centers. Through electrostatic and orbital analyses, these interactions are identified as halogen, chalcogen, and PnBs, not as &#8220;hydridic hydrogen bonds.&#8221; The study promotes clarity in nomenclature consistent with IUPAC guidelines.








Abstract
The definition and classification of noncovalent interactions are essential for consistent communication in supramolecular chemistry. A recent paper introduced the term &#8220;hydridic hydrogen bond&#8221; to describe interactions where hydrogen atoms bound to electropositive elements (e.g., Si, Ge, Sn) act as electron donors. However, such terminology conflicts with IUPAC definition, which requires hydrogen to be bonded to more electronegative atoms for a hydrogen bond (HB). Herein, we combine electrostatic potential analysis, energy decomposition, ELF/QTAIM, and NBO calculations to show that interactions involving hydridic hydrogen atoms as donors and heavier main group elements (Br, Se, As) as acceptors are better classified as halogen, chalcogen, and pnictogen bonds (PnBs), respectively. Our results confirm the nucleophilic character of hydridic hydrogen atoms and the electrophilic role of the interacting elements via &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;hole interactions, consistent with established IUPAC definitions. Experimental evidence from NMR supports this classification. By clarifying these interactions&#8217; nature and directionality, we advocate for nomenclature that aligns with chemical intuition and community standards, thereby avoiding confusion caused by unnecessary redefinitions.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Heterochiral and Homochiral Peptides Conjugated to PNA Dimers and Their Integration in Peptide&#8208;Based Hydrogels</title>

Homochiral PNA&#8208;peptide conjugates mixed to homochiral peptides yield hydrogels supporting cell growth.








Abstract
Hybrid biomolecules composed of short peptides and nucleic acid analogues can self&#8208;assemble and are good candidates to produce new materials thanks to their biocompatibility and versatility. The assembly occurs by exploiting hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions between nucleobases and amino acids. The organization of the molecules at the supramolecular level is dictated by the structure of the assembling units. In this work we explored the effect of chirality on the self&#8208;assembly of PNA&#8208;peptide conjugates. We focused on homochiral and heterochiral peptides conjugated to PNA dimers and we characterized by spectroscopic techniques the assembled objects. Furthermore, we investigated the ability of the conjugates to form hydrogels in combination with the peptides. The architecture of the assembled molecules in the hydrogels was investigated, as well as the ability of hydrogels to support cell growth. Interestingly, hydrogels formed by homochiral and heterochiral mixtures show pores of different size. In the hydrogels cells grow along a specific direction, dictated by the fiber axis formed by the assembled compounds and their viability seems related to the gel pore size.

         <title>Unraveling Solvent&#8208;Dependent Chirality Inversion in the Self&#8208;Assembly of Glutamide Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide glutamide amphiphile (18NG) self&#8208;assembles into oppositely chiral supramolecular structures in MCH and DMSO, accompanied by a circular dichroism (CD) signal amplification due to the conformational transition of 18NG from folded to extended.








Abstract
This study investigates the solvent&#8208;modulated supramolecular chirality and assembly kinetics of two naphthalimide structural isomers, 18NG and 23NG, designed from glutamide derivatives linked to 1,8&#8208; and 2,3&#8208;naphthalic anhydrides, respectively. Time&#8208;dependent circular dichroism (CD) spectra reveal that 18NG exhibits chiroptical signal amplification with aging time and solvent&#8208;dependent chirality inversion: In methylcyclohexane (MCH), it forms chiral assemblies with a positive Cotton effect, whereas in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), it exhibits a negative Cotton effect. FT&#8208;IR and XRD analyses demonstrate stronger amide&#8211;amide hydrogen bonds in MCH and dominant hydrophobic interaction in DMSO, where DMSO acts as both a hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor (competing with intermolecular hydrogen bonds) and a high&#8208;polarity solvent promoting alkyl&#8208;chain aggregation. In contrast, 23NG assembles rapidly in both solvents without chirality inversion due to pre&#8208;exposed hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs. These findings show how solvent dictates supramolecular chirality and packing by modulating noncovalent interactions, while structural isomerism governs assembly kinetics and solvent responsiveness. This work provides insights for designing adaptive chiral nanomaterials through molecular structure and solvent control.

Time-dependent circular dichroism (CD) spectra reveal that 18NG exhibits chiroptical signal amplification with aging time and solvent-dependent chirality inversion: In methylcyclohexane (MCH), it forms chiral assemblies with a positive Cotton effect, whereas in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), it exhibits a negative Cotton effect. FT-IR and XRD analyses demonstrate stronger amide&#8211;amide hydrogen bonds in MCH and dominant hydrophobic interaction in DMSO, where DMSO acts as both a hydrogen-bond acceptor (competing with intermolecular hydrogen bonds) and a high-polarity solvent promoting alkyl-chain aggregation. In contrast, 23NG assembles rapidly in both solvents without chirality inversion due to pre-exposed hydrogen-bonding motifs. These findings show how solvent dictates supramolecular chirality and packing by modulating noncovalent interactions, while structural isomerism governs assembly kinetics and solvent responsiveness. This work provides insights for designing adaptive chiral nanomaterials through molecular structure and solvent control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hierarchical MnO2 Nanoflowers and SnO2 Nanoparticles on Rhombohedral LaMnO3 for 2&#160;V Supercapacitor Electrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A symmetric 2&#160;V aqueous symmetric supercapacitor using LaMnO3/MnO2 nanoflower hierarchical electrodes prepared using a simple direct chemical synthesis method exhibits superior performance over bare LaMnO3 and MnO2 electrodes. The enhanced performance is attributed to the effective Mn3+/Mn4+ redox transitions, improved interfacial charge transport, and synergistic interactions enabled by the hierarchical architecture.








Abstract
The strategy of forming hierarchical nanostructures of electroactive materials has shown enhancements in supercapacitor performances. In this study, two hierarchical electrodes are prepared by directly growing MnO2 nanoflowers and SnO2 nanoparticles on rhombohedral LaMnO3 nanostructures using a facile method. An extended potential window of 2&#160;V in a neutral aqueous electrolyte with superior electrochemical characteristics compared to pristine LaMnO3 electrodes is exhibited by these electrodes. Moreover, LaMnO3/MnO2 shows the best performance among the two hierarchical nanostructures. The optimized LaMnO3/MnO2 electrode delivers a high capacity of 426 C g&#8722;1 at a current density of 1 A g&#8722;1, nearly 4.6 times compared to pristine LaMnO3. This hierarchical electrode, due to the synergistic effect, exhibits appreciable cycling stability, outperforming the electrodes based on pristine MnO2 and LaMnO3. The aqueous symmetric supercapacitor fabricated using this electrode shows a capacity of 64 C g&#8722;1 (32 F g&#8722;1) at 1 A g&#8722;1, with a high energy density of 17.8 Whkg&#8722;1 at a constant power density of 2000&#160;W kg&#8722;1. Further, the device delivers 89% of its initial capacitance even after 10 000 charge/discharge operations at 10 A g&#8722;1. This study presents the possibility of using these hierarchical nanostructures in high&#8208;performance aqueous electrolyte supercapacitors (SCs).

         <title>Deep&#8208;Learning Driven Identification of Novel Antimicrobial Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using an AI&#8208;driven pipeline that couples HydrAMP sequence generation with AMPlify activity scoring, we evolved a short tryptophan&#8208;rich parent peptide into a mini&#8208;library of analogues, screened them in silico, and validated the top hits experimentally. The lead candidate, AMP3, shows high antimicrobial activity and membrane&#8208;disruptive ability, demonstrating the power of DL and rational peptide engineering to accelerate antimicrobial peptide discovery.








Abstract
In this study, we report the identification of novel antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) via a machine learning&#8208;driven pipeline. Short Trp&#8208;rich peptide sequences were obtained using the HydrAMP deep learning (DL) algorithm, followed by the in silico screening for antimicrobial activity via the AMPlify DL model. Three candidates, namely AMP1, AMP2, and AMP3, were selected for synthesis and experimental validation. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated in vitro against a panel of Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacterial strains. Among them, AMP3 demonstrated the broader antibacterial spectrum. To investigate the mechanisms of action, we conducted detailed biophysical analyses of AMP3 interaction with liposomal models of bacterial membranes. The data revealed significant perturbation of membrane bilayer stability, supporting the proposed membrane&#8208;targeting activity of AMP3. Overall, our results underscore the potential of DL approaches for the accelerated discovery and mechanistic characterization of novel AMPs.

         <title>Mechanism of Oxidative C&#9472;H Bond Activation by De Novo Designed Artificial Cu Metalloenzymes Using H2O2 and O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanism of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde peroxidation by de novo&#8208;designed Artificial Cu Proteins (ArCuPs) is investigated. A PCET step involving H+ transfer from benzylic C&#9472;H bond to CuII&#9472;OH and ET from O&#8208;centered substrate radical to CuII is found to be the RDS. Outer&#8208;sphere steric modifications alter reactivity. The most active variant produces the least amount of detrimental OH and is the most thermostable. 








Abstract
De novo&#8208;designed artificial Cu protein (ArCuP), 3SCC, featuring a trigonal Cu(His)3 binding environment, activates H2O2, O2, and benzylic C&#9472;H bonds of abiotic substrates. We outline the mechanism of ArCuP&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H peroxidation of one such abiotic substrate, the peroxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA) to benzaldehyde. The CuI(H2O2) complex undergoes homolytic cleavage, producing CuII&#8208;OH and &#8226;OH, akin to the lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs). The rate&#8208;limiting step is found in a PCET process, where the CuII&#8208;OH species accepts the benzylic C&#9472;H proton, accompanied by electron transfer from the O&#8208;centered substrate radical, to produce benzaldehyde. The C&#9472;H peroxidation is modulated by outer&#8208;sphere modifications, with the I12A&#8208;3SCC variant having the highest catalytic proficiency. Combined &#8226;OH monitoring and proteomics analysis reveal that the I12A variant produces the least amount of &#8226;OH, indicating no oxidation of the active site His residues, unlike other ArCuPs. The chemical and thermal stability of the I12A variant contributes to its superior reactivity. The presence of substrate significantly lowers protein&#8208;level oxidation, similar to LPMOs and other Cu and heme&#8208;based enzymes.

         <title>Mellitic Acid as a Stable Abiotic Precursor for Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation: An RNA&#8208;Independent Pathway for Prebiotic Compartmentalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Evidence is presented that prebiotically accessible mellitic (benzenehexacarboxylic) acid (MAc) is forming liquid droplets with short poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine. The capacity of MAc to induce liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation with short oligocations, along with abiotic synthesis routes, makes MAc a viable candidate for an ingredient of early prebiotic membraneless organelles.








Abstract
Apart from playing the well&#8208;recognized roles in the self&#8208;assembly of intracellular machinery liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) constitutes a hypothetical, yet compelling scenario for prebiotic compartmentalization. One challenge facing this idea is the absence (or scarcity) of typical biopolymer precursors of liquid droplets, such as RNA, on early Earth. We demonstrate that mellitic acid (MAc), an abiotic component found in certain minerals and a marker of organic matter in astrobiology, forms liquid droplets with poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine (PLL) across a broad pH range and various mixing ratios. The chain&#8208;length threshold of PLL capable of forming droplets with MAc ((L&#8208;Lys)6) is significantly lower than when ATP, the primary intracellular energy currency, is used to induce LLPS in PLL. MAc&#8208;PLL droplets are highly dynamic systems that respond reversibly to added ATP through an efficient mixing and demixing behavior. The observed effects of pH, ionic strength, temperature, and pressure, as well as isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) data, are all consistent with coulombic interactions being the key contributor to maintaining the droplet state in the MAc&#8208;PLL system. We propose that the capacity to induce LLPS with short oligocations, along with abiotic synthesis routes, positions mellitic acid as a viable candidate for an ingredient of early prebiotic membraneless protocells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from playing the well-recognized roles in the self-assembly of intracellular machinery liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) constitutes a hypothetical, yet compelling scenario for prebiotic compartmentalization. One challenge facing this idea is the absence (or scarcity) of typical biopolymer precursors of liquid droplets, such as RNA, on early Earth. We demonstrate that mellitic acid (MAc), an abiotic component found in certain minerals and a marker of organic matter in astrobiology, forms liquid droplets with poly-L-lysine (PLL) across a broad pH range and various mixing ratios. The chain-length threshold of PLL capable of forming droplets with MAc ((L-Lys)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) is significantly lower than when ATP, the primary intracellular energy currency, is used to induce LLPS in PLL. MAc-PLL droplets are highly dynamic systems that respond reversibly to added ATP through an efficient mixing and demixing behavior. The observed effects of pH, ionic strength, temperature, and pressure, as well as isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) data, are all consistent with coulombic interactions being the key contributor to maintaining the droplet state in the MAc-PLL system. We propose that the capacity to induce LLPS with short oligocations, along with abiotic synthesis routes, positions mellitic acid as a viable candidate for an ingredient of early prebiotic membraneless protocells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Crystal Phase Engineering of Carbon Nitride: Advances in Regulation Strategies and Photocatalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graph abstract: This review systematically explores the crystal phase engineering strategy of carbon nitridebased photocatalysts, contrasting the distinct properties, modification, and application of graphite, crystalline, and amorphous phases. At the end, some future developmental directions and challeges for carbon nitride with different crystal structures were also put forward.








Abstract
Crystal phase engineering emerges as a pivotal strategy to overcome the inherent limitations (e.g., structural defects, rapid charge recombination, and insufficient light absorption), plaguing conventional graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) synthesized by thermal polymerization for photocatalysis. This review systematically explores this innovative approach, contrasting the distinct properties and photocatalytic advantages of graphite, crystalline (CCN), and amorphous (ACN) carbon nitride phases. CCN leverages an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated system for superior charge transport and enhanced light absorption, while ACN exploits abundant vacancies to reduce reaction barriers, narrow the bandgap, and improve light harvesting. We critically assess their performance in diverse applications (H2O2 production, H2 evolution, CO2 reduction, pollutant degradation, biomass oxidation), emphasizing the decisive role of the engineered crystal phase in optimizing activity. Despite progress, challenges in efficiency, stability, and complex&#8208;condition applicability persist. Future research must prioritize refining synthesis for precise phase control, enhancing operational stability, and elucidating underlying reaction mechanisms to advance practical environmental and energy applications.

         <dc:description>
Is it a boron atom, or is it a carbon atom? Given that BO33&#8722; and CO32&#8722; have very similar geometries, one can easily be mistaken for the other. In this paper we detail the probable mischaracterization of a supposed BO33&#8722;&#8208;containing complex.








Abstract
The trinuclear copper complex originally formulated as {[Cu(bpy)2]3BO3}(ClO4)4.2O, purportedly containing a triply bridging BO33&#8722; ligand, appears to be the known complex {[Cu(bpy)2]3CO3}(ClO4)4.0.5H2O, containing a triply bridging carbonate ligand.

         <title>Oxidant&#8208;Free Amidation of Aldehydes Enabled by Electrophotocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrophotocatalytic method for C(sp2)&#8211;N bond formation via radical&#8208;polar crossover (RPC)&#8208;HAT catalysis is presented. The mild operating conditions enable functionalization of a wide range of compounds, with electricity as the sole oxidant.








Abstract
Electrophotocatalysis (EPC) is emerging as a powerful tool in organic synthesis, offering unique redox transformations without the need for sacrificial oxidants or reductants. Building on this activation mode, we have developed an electrophotocatalytic method for the direct amidation of aldehydes, utilizing electricity and protons as oxidants and light to generate chlorine radicals for hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). This sustainable approach is compatible with a wide range of aldehydes and nitrogen&#8208;based nucleophiles, performing efficiently under batch conditions and demonstrating scalability with flow technology. The mild reaction conditions, adequate functional group tolerance, and versatility make this EPC protocol particularly suitable for C&#9472;N bond formation, enabling functionalization of diverse organic compounds and facilitating late&#8208;stage modifications in drug development.

         <title>Automation of Multistep Reaction&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis Using Novel Polystyrene&#8208;Coated Magnetic Particles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel magnetic particles were developed to enable automated high&#8208;throughput multistep synthesis on small&#8208;scale. A covalently linked polystyrene shell efficiently protects the encapsulated magnetic iron core to avoid metal release in commonly used solvents, at elevated temperatures and over a broad pH range, thus providing appropriate magnetic properties allowing full automation of multistep reaction sequences.








Abstract
We have developed novel types of polystyrene&#8208;coated magnetic particles for versatile applications in multistep reaction&#8208;based solid&#8208;phase organic synthesis. These particles feature a protective polymer shell that allows them to function under various reaction conditions while maintaining the beneficial properties of traditional polystyrene beads, such as swelling and shrinking in organic solvents. We applied the particles in diverse multistep syntheses, including and combining amide couplings, nucleophilic aromatic substitutions, and Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura couplings at tens of micromole scale. The ferrimagnetic property of the particles enables their reversible immobilization using an external magnetic field, facilitating efficient reagent change cycles through simple aspiration of the separated supernatant liquid. This immobilization principle was applied to particle conditioning, reactions, washing, deprotection, and linker cleavage, allowing for fully automated parallel syntheses in microtiter plates using an automated liquid&#8208;handling system. This platform has already become routine for hit syntheses from various high&#8208;throughput screening campaigns and will enable the efficient production of a wide variety of new compounds by solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Ongoing developments on magnetic particles, reaction conditions, and automated processing will further extend the application range in medicinal chemistry and beyond.

         <title>Alkali Metal Complexes of a Phosphine&#8208;Functionalized Cyclooctatetraene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel phosphine&#8722;functionalized COT ligand and its inverse sandwich alkali metal complexes (Na, K, Rb, and Cs) were synthesized and structurally characterized. The polymeric architectures vary with the metal ion and crystallization solvent, with an eight&#8208;membered ring obtained for Rb in benzene. UV&#8722;Vis and photophysical studies reveal luminescent properties.








Abstract
The distinctive electronic properties and wide range of applications of cyclooctatetraene (COT) sandwich complexes make exploring this class of compounds essential. The new phosphine&#8208;functionalized proligand 1,4&#8722;bis(dimethylsilylmethyl)diphenylphosphinecycloocta&#8722;2,5,7&#8722;triene, {C8H8&#8722;1,4&#8722;(Me2SiCH2PPh2)2}, was synthesized by reaction of K2COT with Me2Si(Cl)CH2PPh2 first. Subsequent deprotonation with various alkali metal bases led to a series of alkali metal complexes [M2{C8H6&#8722;1,4&#8722;(Me2SiCH2PPh2)2}] (M&#160;=&#160;Na, K, Rb, Cs). Notably, the crystallization solvent and the alkali metals significantly influenced the polymeric architecture and led to structural diversity of all complexes. For instance, the two phosphine arms either coordinate both to one metal atom, while the other metal ion is uncoordinated, or, in other structures, each metal atom is equally coordinated by just one phosphine function. Additionally, the coordination behavior of the pendant phosphine groups determines the emissive nature of these complexes. In all cases, polymeric structures are formed, in which intermolecular interactions between the COT ring and a metal atom are observed. Additionally, Rb forms a benzene&#8208;bridged eight&#8208;membered polymeric structure [{Rb2(C8H6&#8722;1,4&#8722;(Me2SiCH2PPh2)2) (C6H6)2}8]&#8734;. Additionally, the lighter alkali metals in [M2{C8H6&#8722;1,4&#8722;(Me2SiCH2PPh2)2}] can be exchanged by the heavier congeners by using the corresponding tert&#8722;butoxides.

The new phosphine-functionalized proligand 1,4&#8722;bis(dimethylsilylmethyl)diphenylphosphinecycloocta&#8722;2,5,7&#8722;triene, {C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;1,4&#8722;(Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}, was synthesized by reaction of K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;COT with Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si(Cl)CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; first. Subsequent deprotonation with various alkali metal bases led to a series of alkali metal complexes [M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;1,4&#8722;(Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}] (M&#160;=&#160;Na, K, Rb, Cs). Notably, the crystallization solvent and the alkali metals significantly influenced the polymeric architecture and led to structural diversity of all complexes. For instance, the two phosphine arms either coordinate both to one metal atom, while the other metal ion is uncoordinated, or, in other structures, each metal atom is equally coordinated by just one phosphine function. Additionally, the coordination behavior of the pendant phosphine groups determines the emissive nature of these complexes. In all cases, polymeric structures are formed, in which intermolecular interactions between the COT ring and a metal atom are observed. Additionally, Rb forms a benzene-bridged eight-membered polymeric structure [{Rb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;1,4&#8722;(Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;&#8734;&lt;/sub&gt;. Additionally, the lighter alkali metals in [M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;1,4&#8722;(Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}] can be exchanged by the heavier congeners by using the corresponding &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;butoxides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thorium Bis&#8208;Salophen Trimers as Anion Detectors and Binding Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of a thorium trimer 3:3 with &#916;,&#916;,&#916;&#8208;chirality and a pore in the center for anion binding.








Abstract
Bis&#8208;salophen ligands are the condensation product of a tetramine and a salicylaldehyde derivative. They feature two binding sites, both of which are tetradentate with mixed O/N donor atoms. Reaction with the ligand precursor and thorium nitrate tetrahydrate forms a 3:3 metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand trimer with a &#916;&#916;&#916;&#8208;chirality confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography of a racemic single crystal. The structure has a pore in the center of the triangular structure measuring 6.22&#160;&#197; at its narrowest point. This compound is air&#8208; and water&#8208;stable as well as soluble in organic solvents. This compound was screened with a series of tetrabutyl ammonium halide salts, and tetrabutylammonium (TBA) chloride showed the strongest binding to the complex. After the addition of 2 equivalents of TBACl, the complex and salt precipitate out of solution.

         <title>Long Used but Hardly Known: Synthesis and Crystal Structure of Tritium Breeding Li2Be2O3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ternary oxide Li2Be2O3 was synthesized in a HT approach starting from Li2O and BeO using a radiofrequency furnace. Although, the compound has been known for almost 60 years, its crystal structure has only now been elucidated and a phase&#8208;pure synthesis makes the determination of directly assignable properties possible. Li2Be2O3 is discussed for its usage in fusion reactors, as it breeds essential tritium under neutron irradiation.








Abstract
A main challenge for the operation of a nuclear fusion reactor is the consumption of tritium during the fusion process and the limited availability of tritium in natural resources or its production in nuclear power plants. The most promising approach is breeding of new tritium within the operating fusion reactor. For this purpose, suitable breeding materials are needed. Lithium beryllium oxides are a promising class of compounds, as they unite both target and neutron multiplier in one material. While there have already been studies on sintered ceramics in the Li2O&#183;BeO system, the crystal structure of compounds of a defined composition has so far remained unsolved. Herein, we report on the synthesis of phase&#8208;pure Li2Be2O3 in a high&#8208;temperature (HT) approach and its structure determination by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (sc&#8208;XRD). In addition, the compound was characterized by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. The thermal stability, which is important for use as blanket material in a fusion reactor, was examined with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).

Carbenes, first named in 1951, stand as a vivid example of carbon's versatility. Once elusive, they have become powerful tools across chemistry. The isolation of the first stable, singlet carbene (a (phosphino)(silyl)carbene) in 1988 by Guy Bertrand and colleagues marked an important milestone. Today, their stereoelectronic diversity continues to fuel discovery, pushing the limits of how we deploy them. The Concept by B. Sawyer, J.&#160;L. Peltier and R. Jazzar (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202501600) explores popular strategies for their detection and structural elucidation highlighting both their capabilities and limitations.

The Cover Feature illustrates the post&#8208;translational chemoenzymatic conversion that enables an in vitro selection platform for thiazole&#8208;containing macrocyclic peptide ligands. This method exploits the reactivity of ribosomally incorporated thioamides, which undergo enzyme&#8208;free spontaneous heterocyclization to form thiazoline, which is further oxidized by the azoline dehydrogenase (GodE) to yield a thiazole moiety. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Suga, Y. #Goto# and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202501355).

         <title>Platform Design Enabling Silver(III) Stabilization &#9472; The Uprise of AgIIICF3 Chemistry?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 44, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidation state&#160;+III represents the highest known for silver compounds. This Concept Article critically analyzes the main strategies allowing for the authentication of silver(III) compounds, with special focus on AgIIICF3 species, that were discovered back in the 80&#8242;s and 90&#8242;s, but brought back to the scene very recently. They often display an inverted ligand field (ILF) electronic structure, which impacts their reactivity (i.e., inhibited axial nucleophilicity), and enables the expansion of the coordination number (up to 6) of SP&#8208;4 AgIII compounds.








Abstract
Unlike its coinage metal counterparts, copper and gold, silver chemistry remains poorly developed and mostly restricted to the oxidation state&#160;+I, which embraces a large variety of coordination environments and types of ligand. Higher oxidation states, that is, +II and&#160;+III, are significantly less represented and predominantly adopt a square planar (SP&#8208;4) geometry around the metal center. In particular, well&#8208;defined d8 AgIII compounds are scarce, and include only a handful of examples exhibiting out&#8208;of&#8208;plane silver coordination. This Concept Article summarizes the strategies known to stabilize AgIII, as well as the unusual electronic structures (inverted ligand field) often found in these compounds. The intriguing case study of the expansion in the coordination number in AgIIICF3 compounds will be highlighted.

         <title>Spatially Coordinated Delivery of siRNA and Peptide Antagonist by Using Quantum Dots for Synergetic Cancer Therapy</title>

Quantum dots (QDs) facilitate ElP103&#8208;mediated siEZH2 delivery by forming RPQDs, which enhance cellular uptake and promote efficient lysosomal escape.








Abstract
We present in this work a quantum&#8208;dot (QDs)&#8208;based delivery strategy for siRNA which shows pronounced improvements of stability against enzymatic degradation by ribonucleases, cellular uptake due to positively charge, and release from endosomes. The introduction of RNA&#8208;binding peptide to the QDs surface enables the dual delivery of the siRNA&#8208;peptide assembly. Briefly, EZH2&#8208;targeting peptide (EIP103) was first introduced to QDs surface via biotin&#8208;streptavidin interaction (PQDs), followed by incubation of siRNA that silences EZH2 (siEZH2). The self&#8208;assembly of EIP103 and siEZH2 on the QDs surface (RPQDs) was achieved via electrostatic attraction between the cationic EIP103 and the negatively charged siEZH2. The results revealed that the obtained RPQDs not only protect both EIP103 peptides and siEZH2 from enzymatic hydrolysis but also promote their endocytosis and endosome escape. This study demonstrates the feasibility of dual delivery and targeting of peptides and siRNA, offering a novel strategy for the synergistic cancer therapy.

         <title>Implementation of the Hard&#8208;Soft Acid&#8208;Base Principle for the Direct Synthesis of Bimetallic Zirconium&#8208;Nickel and Hafnium&#8208;Nickel Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with a Polar Pore Environment</title>

Successful implementation of the HSAB principle using a bifunctional pyrazole&#8208;carboxylic acid organic linker afforded in one&#8208;pot synthesis heterometallic (Zr/Ni and Hf/Ni) MOFs with a polar pore environment, suitable for gas separation applications.








Abstract
An important direction in MOFs is the development of materials with well&#8208;defined and ordered heterogeneity toward novel functionalities and control of important properties at the atomic scale. A great approach is the designed synthesis of mixed&#8208;metal MOFs (M'MOFs) made of different building units based on distinct metal cations. However, their in&#8208;situ formation and co&#8208;assembly into an extended crystalline framework present great challenges due to the different kinetic and thermodynamic parameters. We report the successful synthesis of two isostructural, bimetallic Zr&#8208;Ni and Hf&#8208;Ni M'MOFs following the hard and soft acid and base (HSAB) principle. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed the formation of a 3D structure that features an in&#8208;situ formed [Ni(HPyC)4Cl2]4&#8722; 4&#8208;c nonplanar metallo&#8208;ligand that bridges 8&#8208;c Zr(Hf)6&#8208;clusters. The resulting (4, 8)&#8208;c scu&#8208;type framework shows polygonal 1D channels, with a largest pore diameter of approximately 9&#160;&#197;, decorated by Cl&#8722; anions. This polar pore environment was found fully accessible, and both materials were investigated for Xe/Kr and CO2/CH4 separation. The results are very promising, showing that the IAST selectivity calculated for a 20:80 Xe/Kr molar mixture is 8.2 and 7.1 at 298&#160;K for the Zr_Ni&#8208;scu&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 and Hf_Ni&#8208;scu&#8208;MOF&#8208;1, respectively, which is comparable to some of the best&#8208;performing materials.

         <title>Acceptor&#8208;Adaptive Automated Glycosylation Optimization for Automated Glycan Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 44, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The difficulty of finding the optimal glycosylation conditions for automated solid&#8208;phase glycan assembly leads to the use of large temperature ranges and excess reagents. This has negative atom and energy efficiency implications. We demonstrate that mirroring glycosylation temperature from solution to solid phase via an automated acceptor&#8208;adaptive optimization strategy empowers an efficient and sustainable automated glycan assembly (AGA) process.








Abstract
Optimization of glycosylation temperatures is essential for automated solid&#8208;phase glycan assembly. Constructing a reliable optimization system that mimics key reaction components is crucial for increasing the atom economy and the energy efficiency of the process. Although glycosyl acceptors play a pivotal role in glycosylation, evaluating their effect on glycosylation efficiency (GE) is nontrivial. While screening various glycosyl acceptors for optimization is impractical, compromising for simple alkyl acceptors produces results of dubious relevance. We demonstrate that optimization with a modified trans&#8208;4&#8208;aminocyclohexanol&#8208;based acceptor accurately reflects the optimal glycosylation temperature of several glycosyl acceptors, overcoming previous limitations. The contextual use of both n&#8208;alkyl and glycan&#8208;mimetic acceptors for automated optimization enabled translation of optimized glycosylation temperature to highly efficient solid&#8208;phase synthesis (SPS) of disaccharides.

Backbone Thz moieties prevail in bioactive peptidic natural products and play important roles in their biological functions. Here, we report an in vitro selection platform for Thz&#8208;containing macrocyclic peptides, established through a posttranslational chemoenzymatic transformation.

Abstract
Backbone thiazole (Thz) moieties prevail in bioactive peptidic natural products and play important roles in their biological functions. However, the de novo discovery of artificial Thz&#8208;containing peptide ligands remains challenging. Here, we report an mRNA display&#8208;based selection platform for Thz&#8208;containing macrocyclic peptides (ThzteMP), established through a dedicated posttranslational chemoenzymatic transformation. This method exploits the unique reactivity of ribosomally incorporated thioamides, enabling enzyme&#8208;free spontaneous heterocyclization to form thiazoline (Thn), which is further oxidized using the substrate&#8208;tolerant azoline dehydrogenase (GodE) to yield a Thz moiety. By integrating this chemoenzymatic process with chloroacetyl&#8208;mediated thioether macrocyclization and mRNA display, we have successfully discovered Thz&#8208;containing macrocyclic peptide ligands with high binding affinities against p21&#8208;activated kinase 4 (PAK4). This study establishes a robust system to expedite ligand discovery of pseudo&#8208;natural peptides and to investigate the functional benefit of their backbone Thzs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backbone thiazole (Thz) moieties prevail in bioactive peptidic natural products and play important roles in their biological functions. However, the de novo discovery of artificial Thz-containing peptide ligands remains challenging. Here, we report an mRNA display-based selection platform for Thz-containing macrocyclic peptides (&lt;sup&gt;Thz&lt;/sup&gt;teMP), established through a dedicated posttranslational chemoenzymatic transformation. This method exploits the unique reactivity of ribosomally incorporated thioamides, enabling enzyme-free spontaneous heterocyclization to form thiazoline (Thn), which is further oxidized using the substrate-tolerant azoline dehydrogenase (GodE) to yield a Thz moiety. By integrating this chemoenzymatic process with chloroacetyl-mediated thioether macrocyclization and mRNA display, we have successfully discovered Thz-containing macrocyclic peptide ligands with high binding affinities against p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4).

In this research, we have successfully achieved the efficient synthesis of disubstituted &#947;&#8208;ketophosphine derivatives through the reaction between [TBA][P(SiCl3)2] and N&#8208;(aryl)acrylamides. This strategy utilizes the active low&#8208;valence [TBA][P(SiCl3)2] prepared from phosphoric acid as the phosphorus source, offering a novel, cost&#8208;effective, and highly efficient approach for the preparation of &#947;&#8208;ketophosphine derivatives with unique biological activities.

         <title>Efficient Photocatalytic Degradation of Methylene Blue From Aqueous Solution Using Hybrid Biomass&#8208;Derived Nanostructured Carbon&#8208;TiO2 Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 44, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid photocatalyst of biomass&#8208;derived carbon nanospheres and TiO&#8322; has been developed from waste coffee leaves, achieving 99% MB dye degradation. The carbon reduces the bandgap, boosting UV photocatalysis, and the material shows excellent stability and recyclability, offering a sustainable, scalable solution for wastewater treatment.








Abstract
Industrial dye usage results in substantial wastewater discharge, posing environmental and health hazards. Hence, developing efficient, sustainable, and cost&#8208;effective treatment technologies is crucial. Photocatalysis using TiO&#8322; has emerged as a promising approach for dye degradation. This study explores the photocatalytic removal of methylene blue (MB), a model dye pollutant, using a composite of biomass&#8208;derived carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) and nanosized TiO&#8322; under UV light. The CNPs were synthesized via one&#8208;step pyrolysis from waste coffee leaves, offering a sustainable carbon source. The resulting CNPs (CL&#8208;10) and the TiO&#8322;&#8208;CNP composite (PC@CL&#8208;10) were thoroughly characterized using advanced techniques. Incorporating carbon significantly reduces the band gap of TiO&#8322; from &#8764;3.2&#160;eV to 2.90&#160;eV, enhancing photocatalytic activity. Degradation studies under varying catalyst doses, dye concentrations, and pH levels demonstrate effective MB removal under UV irradiation. Photocatalytic experiments revealed up to 99% degradation of MB under UV light, while tests conducted in the dark showed negligible activity, confirming the light&#8208;dependent efficiency. Kinetic analysis indicated that intra&#8208;particle diffusion (IPD) governs the dye degradation process. Moreover, recyclability tests over seven cycles showed consistent performance with minimal decline, highlighting the catalyst's stability and reusability. These findings suggest that PC@CL&#8208;10 is a highly effective, low&#8208;cost photocatalyst with strong potential for large&#8208;scale wastewater treatment applications.

         <title>Mono&#8208; IrIII versus Heterobimetallic IrIII&#8208;AuI Complexes for Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 44, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two enantiopure heterobimetallic complexes, namely &#916;&#8208;IrAu&#8208;4 and &#923;&#8208;IrAu&#8208;4, have been synthesized. The photophysical and chiroptical properties were characterized and compared with the archetypal &#923;/&#916;&#8208;Ir(ppy)2(acac), highlighting an increase in gLum value moving from mono&#8208; to heterobimetallic Ir(III) complexes. This work provides valuable insights on the design of better and more efficient CPL&#8208;active complexes and materials for CP&#8208;optoelectronics.








Abstract
Fundamental rationalization of the structural&#8212;circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity relationship is a challenging task. Herein, a pair of enantiopure, heterobimetallic IrIII&#9472;AuI complexes IrAu&#8208;4 featuring chirality&#8208;at&#8208;metal is thoroughly investigated by means of spectroscopical and computational techniques, also including spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC) effects. Upon resolution of the racemic mixture of the starting chloro&#8208;bridged dimer via a chiral auxiliary ligand, the complexes IrIII&#9472;AuI are straightforwardly prepared in a stepwise procedure with retention of configuration in good yields. The IrAu&#8208;4 complexes display moderate orange phosphorescence arising from an admixed metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT/3LLCT) excited state and good chiroptical activity, as shown by both electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and CPL spectroscopy. A comparison between the parental mononuclear pairs &#916;&#8208;Ir(ppy)2(acac) and &#923;&#8208;Ir(ppy)2(acac) and the binuclear IrAu&#8208;4 counterparts also provides interesting insights. The latter possess higher dissymmetry factor (gLum) values despite the very similar ECD activity of the lower&#8208;lying 1MLCT band with enantiospecific polarization bias of the light dictated by the chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal configuration. The different nature of the emissive excited state between the two families of complexes and its implication onto the radiative rate constant and the dipolar force is tentatively accounted for the increased CPL&#8208;activity observed in IrAu&#8208;4.

         <title>Hybrid Tuning in NHC Ligands: Synergistic Effects of BIAN &#960;&#8208;Conjugation and Aryl &#963;&#8208;Modulation in Gold(I) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 44, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study investigates how combining &#960;&#8208;extended backbones with aryl substituent variation in Au(I)/BIAN&#8211;NHCX complexes affects their structure, photophysics, reactivity, and toxicity. It is evident that subtle changes in substituent type and position give rise to distinct trends, thus demonstrating how it is possible to harness &#960;&#8211;&#963; interactions in order to fine&#8208;tune properties for catalytic and biomedical applications.








Abstract
In this study, we explore extended design of metal&#8211;NHC complexes that relies on dual strategies for tuning ligand properties: (i) electronic modulation through &#960;&#8208;extended frameworks such as bis(imino)acenaphthene (BIAN), and (ii) systematic aryl substitution to influence &#963;&#8208;donor strength and steric environment. We report the first integrated exploration of these two strategies on a unified ligand platform. A series of Au(I)/BIAN&#8211;NHCX complexes were synthesized by introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents (X&#160;=&#160;F, Cl, Br, CF&#8323;) at the ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, and para&#8208;positions of the N&#8208;aryl groups.

&lt;p&gt;The present study investigates how combining &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-extended backbones with aryl substituent variation in Au(I)/BIAN&#8211;NHC&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; complexes affects their structure, photophysics, reactivity, and toxicity. It is evident that subtle changes in substituent type and position give rise to distinct trends, thus demonstrating how it is possible to harness &lt;i&gt;&#960;&#8211;&#963;&lt;/i&gt; interactions in order to fine-tune properties for catalytic and biomedical applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we explore extended design of metal&#8211;NHC complexes that relies on dual strategies for tuning ligand properties: (i) electronic modulation through &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-extended frameworks such as bis(imino)acenaphthene (BIAN), and (ii) systematic aryl substitution to influence &lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;-donor strength and steric environment. We report the first integrated exploration of these two strategies on a unified ligand platform. A series of Au(I)/BIAN&#8211;NHC&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; complexes were synthesized by introducing electron-withdrawing substituents (X&#160;=&#160;F, Cl, Br, CF&#8323;) at the &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-, and &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-positions of the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-aryl groups. This hybrid tuning approach allowed us to probe the synergistic and antagonistic effects arising from &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt; interplay across multiple dimensions. Each complex was thoroughly characterized with respect to synthetic yield, structural features (including X-ray structure and dynamics in solution), photophysical properties (UV-Vis and luminescence), catalytic performance in hydroamination of phenylacetylene, and cytotoxicity in HEK293T cells. Structure&#8211;property correlations revealed distinct cooperative and counteractive regimes depending on the substituent type and position. These findings demonstrate that combining orthogonal electronic control elements enables a more predictive and fine-grained design of NHC-based metal complexes, with future implications for catalysis, materials science, and biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Crystal Actuation of Fluorinated Acylhydrazones Enabled by [2+2] Photocycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 44, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three isomeric fluorinated acylhydrazone derivatives (DFBP&#8208;IND, DFBP&#8208;BHD, DFBP&#8208;3&#8208;FBHD) were successfully synthesized and demonstrated dynamic photo&#8208;responsive behavior ranging from crack initiation to crystal fragmentation under 365 nm UV irradiation. The photochemical mechanism was explored in detail and highlighted the essential role of the C&#9552;N bond in the acylhydrazone framework for enabling [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;driven actuation. Our structural engineering strategy established a design paradigm for photoresponsive materials through rational selection of hydrazide precursors, enabling precise modulation of optomechanical properties.








Abstract
Crystalline materials with photomechanical responsiveness have garnered significant attention in flexible actuators and micro/nano&#8208;electromechanical systems due to their unique capability to directly convert light into mechanical energy. In this work, four novel fluorinated acylhydrazone compounds were successfully synthesized through direct condensation reactions between 4,4&#8242;&#8208;difluorobenzophenone (DFBP) and acylhydrazine compounds, including benzoylhydrazine (BHD), 3&#8208;fluorobenzoylhydrazine (3&#8208;FBHD), isoniazid (IND), and acetylhydrazine (AED). Systematic investigation of their photomechanical responses revealed distinct molecular mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate that isomeric fluorinated acylhydrazone derivatives (DFBP&#8208;BHD, DFBP&#8208;3&#8208;FBHD, DFBP&#8208;IND) exhibit dynamic photo&#8208;responsive behavior ranging from crack initiation to crystal fragmentation under 365&#160;nm UV irradiation, whereas the hydrazone derivative DFBP&#8208;AED remains inert. This confirms the essential role of [2&#160;+&#160;2] photocycloaddition&#8208;dependent C&#160;=&#160;N double bonds in photomechanical activity. Comprehensive characterization through DSC, TG, XRD, &#185;H/&#185;3C NMR, and MS elucidated the formation pathways and structural characteristics of photocycloaddition products. Density functional theory calculations revealed that energy disparities between (0 0 1) and (1 0 0) crystallographic planes govern longitudinal fragmentation patterns. This study establishes a &#8220;molecular structure&#8208;crystal arrangement&#8208;macroscopic response&#8221; multi&#8208;scale regulation strategy, offering novel insights for developing high&#8208;performance light&#8208;driven materials.

Modular self&#8208;assembly of extendable porphyrin&#8208;based heterotrimetallic discrete architectures: a new efficient strategy toward the construction of stable multicomponent functional systems.








Abstract
An efficient strategy for the preparation of heterometallic discrete porphyrin assemblies, tuned both in dimensions and number of metal centers, is described. Five rod&#8208;shaped di&#8208;pyridyl FeII&#8208;metalloligands, with varied length (1.5 &#8211; 3.2&#160;nm), lateral substituents, and number of iron centers, were used to bridge two RuII&#8208;metallacycles, made of two coplanar ZnII&#8208;porphyrin each. The resulting architectures consist of four RuII complexes, four zinc&#8208;porphyrins, and either two or four FeII&#8208;clathrochelate units. Earlier, geometrically similar sandwich&#8208;like architectures were based on purely organic connectors. Among other novel characteristics, the use of metalloligands was found to be beneficial for the overall stability, thus allowing for a solution&#8208;based characterization of the assemblies. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structures were determined for the complete collection, highlighting additional key features: the two facing ZnII&#8208;porphyrin platforms are set wide apart according to the span of the two connecting metalloligands, while the latter are parallelly aligned by the anchoring ZnII&#8208;porphyrin/RuII&#8208;metallacycles, at fixed inter Fe&#183;&#183;Fe distance(s). Mutual control over these geometrical parameters is very strict, as evidenced by self&#8208;sorting experiments. Useful implementation of these systems into functional systems may be envisaged by pairing the peripheral metalloporphyrin photosensitizers with photo/redox/catalytically active inner metal cores.

         <title>Expanding the Scope of BICAAC Organocatalyst: Hydroboration of Carbonyl and Alkyne Substrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 44, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
BICAAC efficiently mediates the hydroborative reduction of carbonyls and alkynes. In situ control experiments, 1H NMR monitoring, and DFT calculations show BICAAC acts as a pre&#8208;catalyst, forming the active species in situ via oxidative addition of the B&#9472;H bond at the carbene center. This species lowers the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap between benzaldehyde and HBpin, enabling the reaction. These insights elucidate BICAAC's mechanistic role and highlight its potential in advancing metal&#8208;free catalytic systems.








Abstract
Bicyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (BICAAC) (I) has been used as a highly effective catalyst for hydroboration of aldehydes, ketones, and alkynes. The catalyst is effective across a broad range of substrates bearing both electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, indicating its robust functional group tolerance. Mechanistic investigations, supported by both experimental studies and computational analyses, suggest the initial step involves the reaction of BICAAC (I) with pinacolborane (HBpin), leading to the formation of boron&#8211;carbene complex (active catalyst II). This active species facilitates substrate activation. A subsequent hydride transfer from an additional equivalent of HBpin to the activated substrate completes the reduction process. This stepwise mechanism underscores the dual role of HBpin as both a catalyst activator and a hydride donor. The interaction between BICAAC and HBpin is pivotal, as it modulates the electronic environment of the boron center to promote efficient hydride delivery.

         <title>Productive Homogeneous Hydrogenation of Fatty Esters with Carboxylate SNS Ruthenium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 44, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carboxylate ruthenium complexes, prepared from easily accessible ruthenium precursors and bis(2&#8208;(ethylthio)ethyl)amine (SNS ligand), efficiently catalyze the hydrogenation (HY) of methyl decanoate (model for the FAME reduction) to 1&#8208;decanol with H2 under mild conditions and without solvents. The acetate trans&#8208;[Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)2(SNS)(PPh3)] derivative catalyzes the HY of a number of long&#8208;chain and aromatic methyl&#8208; and ethyl esters at extremely high S/C (up to 100,&#160;000).








Abstract
The carboxylate pincer complexes trans&#8208;[Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OCOR)2(SNS)(PPh3)] (R&#160;=&#160;CH3 1, tBu 2; SNS&#160;=&#160;bis(2&#8208;(ethylthio)ethylamine) are obtained from [Ru(&#951;2&#8208;OCOR)2(PPh3)2] (R&#160;=&#160;CH3, tBu) and HN(CH2CH2SEt)2 in acetone by elimination of PPh3. Substitution of PPh3 in 1 with PPh2Me gives trans&#8208;[Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)2(SNS)(PPh2Me)] (3) in toluene at 105&#176;C. The cationic complexes cis&#8208;[Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)(SNS)(dppb)]OAc (4) and [Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)(CO)(SNS)(PPh3)]OAc (5) are synthesized from [Ru(&#951;2&#8208;OAc)2(dppb)] and [Ru(&#951;2&#8208;OAc)2(CO)(PPh3)2], respectively, by treatment with the SNS ligand in toluene. Hydride trans&#8208;[RuH(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)(SNS)(PPh3)] (6) is obtained by reaction of 1 with NaOiPr in a mixture of iPrOH/toluene. The carboxylate complexes 1&#8211;6 catalyze the homogeneous hydrogenation of methyl decanoate to 1&#8208;decanol with NaOMe under mild reaction conditions (T&#160;=&#160;40&#176;C, H2 pressure 27.5&#160;bar) and extremely low catalyst loading (S/C 10,000&#8211;100,000). Complexes 1 and 2 display remarkably high catalytic activity for the reduction of fatty acid methyl and ethyl esters at S/C of 50,000&#8211;100,000, with high selectivity for the reduction of the carboxylate group in the presence of C&#160;&#9552;&#160;C functionalities. An easy scale&#8208;up of this process (100&#160;mmol of substrate) has been demonstrated. Mechanistic studies show that 1 reacts with H2 (5&#160;bar), affording the monohydride 6, that by further reaction with H2 and an alkoxide gives the dihydride cis&#8208;[RuH2(SNS)(PPh3)], which reduces methyl benzoate to benzyl alcohol.

     alt="Productive Homogeneous Hydrogenation of Fatty Esters with Carboxylate SNS Ruthenium Catalysts"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carboxylate ruthenium complexes, prepared from easily accessible ruthenium precursors and bis(2-(ethylthio)ethyl)amine (SNS ligand), efficiently catalyze the hydrogenation (HY) of methyl decanoate (model for the FAME reduction) to 1-decanol with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under mild conditions and without solvents. The acetate &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-[Ru(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-OAc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SNS)(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)] derivative catalyzes the HY of a number of long-chain and aromatic methyl- and ethyl esters at extremely high S/C (up to 100,&#160;000).

         <title>Zirconium&#8208;Mediated Hydroaminoalkylation of Conjugated Dienes Probed by a Computational Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 44, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;depth computational mechanistic probe of the zirconium&#8208;mediated hydroaminoalkylation of conjugated dienes with N&#8208;aryl substituted amines complements previous stochiometric and catalytic studies, providing a deeper understanding of intricate mechanistic details.








Abstract
An in&#8208;depth computational probe of the hydroaminoalkylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with N&#8208;aryl substituted amines by a tethered bis(ureate)&#8208;ligated zirconium compound is reported. The mechanistic proposal derived from smooth energy profiles acquired by employing a reliable computational protocol complies with previous experimental mechanistic studies, providing a more advanced understanding of intricate mechanistic aspects. The high degree of regioselectivity achieved for reversible diene insertion and butenyl tether protonolysis is instrumental for the generation of the main product, (E)&#8208;4,1 linear homoallylic amine. Product liberation and regeneration of the zirconaaziridine favours a two&#8208;step sequence comprising transamination with incoming amine, followed by &#946;&#8208;hydrogen abstraction at the intervening zircona bis&#8208;amide. The irreversible transamination is likely the regioselectivity&#8208;determining event that dictates the product composition. The &#946;&#8208;hydrogen abstraction at the zircona bis&#8208;amide, which likely constitutes the catalyst resting state, is turnover limiting. Its DFT&#8208;assessed defining barrier conforms with reported catalyst performance data. The role of the smaller, more nucleophilic dimethylamide in the catalytic transformation has been revealed.

         <title>On the Reaction of Pacman&#8208;Phosphanes with Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 44, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of a Pacman phosphane (a macrocyclic, multidentate phosphane ligand) with Lewis acids such as BPh&#8323;, B(C&#8326;F&#8325;)&#8323;, and GaCl&#8323; were investigated, revealing distinct bonding motifs and coordination behaviors. While B(C&#8326;F&#8325;)&#8323; forms a stable di&#8208;adduct, GaCl&#8323; induces an unusual structural rearrangement with the formation of a [Pacman&#8208;GaCl&#8322;]&#8314;[GaCl&#8324;]&#8315; salt and a rare tetracoordinated phosphorus center in the&#160;+&#160;III oxidation state.








Abstract
The reactions of Pacman phosphanes (1a) with Lewis acids such as R3B (R&#160;=&#160;C6H5, C6F5) and GaCl3 were investigated. While equilibria between mono&#8208; and di&#8208;adducts were found in the reaction with BPh3, B(C6F5)3 preferentially formed the di&#8208;adduct (1a&#183;2B(C6F5)3), which could be isolated and fully characterized. density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the N&#8208;bonded adducts are thermodynamically more stable than the P&#8208;bonded adducts. In contrast to the reaction of the Pacman phosphane with boranes, GaCl3 reacted with 1a to give an unusual [Pacman&#8208;GaCl2]+[GaCl4]&#8722; salt, featuring a nearly planar GaN2C2 heterocycle as part of the Pacman macrocycle. In addition, the coordination geometry on one P atom changes from triple to an unusual quadruple coordination, although it is still a formal P atom in the&#160;+&#160;III oxidation state, as shown by quantum chemical calculations.

Abstract
Rationalized by a thermochemical evaluation using both theoretical density functional theory (DFT) and empirical data, we show that the arene&#8208;encapsulated M+&#160;cations of the group 1 alumanyls, [{SiNDipp}AlM]2 ({SiNDipp} = {CH2SiMe2N(Dipp)}2; Dipp&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3); M&#160;=&#160;Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs] may be interconverted by redox reactions with the elemental alkali metals. These observations contradict the established E0 data and allow access to an otherwise inaccessible sodium derivative.

         <title>Deep Learning for Hyperpolarized NMR of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins Without Resolution Loss: Access to Short&#8208;Lived Intermediates</title>

Abstract
The inherently low sensitivity of solution&#8208;state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) has long limited its ability to characterize transient biomolecular states at atomic resolution. While dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (dDNP) offers a compensating signal enhancement, its broader use has been hindered by rapid polarization decay, causing severe spectral distortion. Here, we introduce HyperW&#8208;Decon, an approach that enables high&#8208;sensitivity, high&#8208;resolution NMR of biomolecules in solution. HyperW&#8208;Decon combines two key aspects: (i) the use of hyperpolarized water (HyperW) to transfer polarization to proteins through rapid proton exchange; and (ii) a theory&#8208;driven, machine learning (ML)&#8211;based deconvolution method that corrects polarization&#8208;induced artifacts without requiring external reference signals. This approach is based on a first&#8208;principles understanding of dDNP line shapes and delivers a scalable solution to spectral distortion. Applied to intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) involved in biomineralization, HyperW&#8208;Decon reveals previously inaccessible, short&#8208;lived ion&#8208;peptide encounter complexes with residue resolution.

         <title>How to Track Mechanochemical Reactions in Resonant Acoustic Mixers by in Situ Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We define a practical operational window for in situ Raman monitoring in resonant acoustic mixing (RAM), a milling media&#8208;free alternative to ball milling. By optimizing key parameters, including vessel design, filling degree, and acceleration, we establish conditions that enable robust spectral acquisition across various mechanochemical transformations. This framework facilitates reliable reaction tracking in RAM.








Abstract
Mechanochemical processes have traditionally been explored using ball mills; however, resonant acoustic mixers (RAM) offer a compelling alternative, operating without milling media and enabling scalable, solvent&#8208;free synthesis. Despite their advantages, direct transfer of reaction conditions from ball mills to RAM has proven nontrivial, requiring careful optimization of key parameters. In this study, we systematically define an operational window for effective in situ Raman monitoring in RAM. Critical parameters&#8212;including vessel material, applied gravitational force, filling degree, substrate rheology, and reaction time&#8212;were assessed to ensure high&#8208;quality spectral acquisition. Utilizing a sapphire&#8208;glass window and a precisely aligned laser setup, we achieved strong, reproducible Raman signals under controlled conditions. The optimal window was found to include a minimum filling degree of 10% and applied g&#8208;forces between 20 and 70&#160;g. This framework was validated across diverse mechanochemical reactions, including organic condensations (Knoevenagel and quinoxaline), metal&#8208;organic framework formation (ZIF), and catalytic coupling (Glaser reaction), demonstrating the robustness and versatility of in situ Raman spectroscopy in RAM&#8208;based synthesis.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Sulfur&#8208;Mediated C&#8208;S Bond Formation: Mechanistic Insights from the state&#8208;crossing tRNA Methylthiolation by the Radical SAM Enzyme MiaB</title>

         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;sulfur cluster chemistry: The mechanism of the MiaB&#8208;catalyzed methylthiolation of N6&#8208;isopentenyladenosine at position 37 in tRNA is elucidated. The reaction sequence clearly demonstrates that the state&#8208;crossing methylthiolation occurs following C2&#8208;H abstraction by 5&#8242;&#8208;dAdo&#8226;. Moreover, the essential role of the auxiliary [3Fe&#8208;4S] cluster is revealed, as it functions as both the methyl carrier and the direct sulfur donor during catalysis.








Abstract
The radical S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzyme MiaB is a bifunctional catalyst that mediates the posttranscriptional methylthiolation of N6&#8208;isopentenyladenosine (i6A37) at position 37 in tRNA. Herein, density functional calculations were employed to elucidate the two stages of MiaB&#8208;catalyzed modification: methylation and sulfur insertion at the C2 position of i6A37. MiaB contains two iron&#8208;sulfur clusters: a radical SAM cluster ([4Fe&#8208;4S]RS) and an auxiliary cluster ([3Fe&#8208;4S]Aux). Our calculations demonstrate that the [4Fe&#8208;4S]RS cluster is essential for generating the potent oxidant 5&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosyl radical (5&#8242;&#8208;dAdo&#8226;) via the reductive cleavage of SAM and that the [3Fe&#8208;4S]Aux cluster serves both as the carrier of methyl and as a direct sulfur donor during catalysis. Furthermore, it is revealed that a state crossing occurs during the methylthio installation at the substrate, which follows C2&#8208;H abstraction by 5&#8242;&#8208;dAdo&#8226;. Additionally, substituting Arg66 with glutamine highlights its critical role in stabilizing the substrate radical and modulating MiaB activity. Overall, our work advances the understanding of iron&#8208;sulfur cluster chemistry and inert C&#8208;H bond activation within the growing superfamily of radical SAM enzymes, offering insights for translating the catalytic advantages of natural enzymes into synthetic transition&#8208;metal complexes and functional materials.

         <dc:description>
A series of bifluorenylidene&#8208;based BAEs and their derivatives have been prepared via the palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki coupling/Heck cyclization tandem reaction in one pot from the substrates containing boronic ester groups and 2&#8208;bromophenyl trifluoromethanesulfonate or similar derivatives.








Abstract
A variety of bifluorenylidene&#8208;based bistricyclic aromatic enes (BAEs) and their derivatives have been prepared via the palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki coupling/Heck cyclization tandem reaction in one pot. In the new scheme, 2&#8208;bromophenyl trifluoromethanesulfonate and similar derivatives were chosen as one of the reaction substrates, which could undergo a tandem Suzuki coupling/Heck cyclization reaction with suitable arylboronic acid ester substrates to afford the expected BAEs and their derivatives. In the newly designed scheme, the raw materials are easier to obtain and can be applied to the synthesis of more BAEs and their derivatives.

         <title>A Tunable, Amine&#8208;Functionalized Porous Silica Catalyst for CO2&#160;Transformation into Cyclic Organic Carbonates at Atmospheric Pressure</title>

Tunable amine&#8208;functionalized silica catalysts with channel and wormhole like morphology utilized for CO2 fixation reaction into cyclic organic carbonates (COCs) from epoxides at atmospheric pressure.








Abstract
A silica catalyst with characteristic features of broad pore size distribution, large pore width and tunable basic sites was synthesized by a one&#8208;step green co&#8208;condensation synthesis method analogous to SBA&#8208;15 synthesis. The surface chemical features of the above catalyst were explored by XPS, N2 and CO2 adsorption and desorption experiments. The catalyst showed 90% conversion of styrene oxide (SO) with nearly complete selectivity toward styrene carbonate (SC) in 7&#160;hours under a solvent&#8208;free condition at a temperature of 120&#160;&#176;C with the aid of co&#8208;catalyst tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB). Moreover, the catalyst demonstrates versatility with various epoxide substrates, providing valuable insights into the cycloaddition reaction under ambient pressure conditions involving carbon dioxide. The mechanistic details of the catalytic conversion were investigated by the in&#8208;situ DRIFT studies and reported here.

The surface chemical features of the above catalyst were explored by XPS, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and desorption experiments. The catalyst showed 90% conversion of styrene oxide (SO) with nearly complete selectivity toward styrene carbonate (SC) in 7&#160;hours under a solvent-free condition at a temperature of 120&#160;&#176;C with the aid of co-catalyst tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB). Moreover, the catalyst demonstrates versatility with various epoxide substrates, providing valuable insights into the cycloaddition reaction under ambient pressure conditions involving carbon dioxide. The mechanistic details of the catalytic conversion were investigated by the in-situ DRIFT studies and reported here.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry Generates Adaptative Libraries of Glyco&#8208;Dyn[n]Arenes That can Be Templated to Produce Anti&#8208;Adhesive Glycoconjugates Targeting Pseudomonas aeruginosa</title>

DCC enables the formation of glycocluster libraries through reversible disulfide exchange. Nanomolar ligands for multiple lectins (ConA, LecA, and LecB) were identified in a simple experimental set up, purified, and displayed nanomolar affinity with anti&#8208;infectious properties.








Abstract
Carbohydrate&#8208;protein interactions are important in cell&#8208;cell communication, signal transduction, cancer, or infection. Chemists have designed glycosylated multivalent systems to mimic these recognition phenomena and produce potent ligands of lectins with therapeutic applications. Dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC) provides access to libraries of glycosylated macrocycles equilibrating through reversible covalent bonds. This strategy can be applied to the rapid and efficient identification of multivalent glycoclusters by introducing a protein into the equilibrating library. This strategy allowed the identification of the best ligands for more than one lectin in a single experimental set up by using two simple 1,4&#8208;dithiophenol building blocks. Selection of the best binder by each lectin (ConA, LecA, and LecB) was accompanied by the amplification of glyco&#8208;dyn[3]arenes and glyco&#8208;dyn[4]arenes. These macrocycles could be synthesized, isolated, and displayed nanomolar dissociation constants. Furthermore, while no toxicity could be detected against human cells or bacteria, their anti&#8208;adhesive properties against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were confirmed through a virulence assay on human cells. Altogether, extremely simple 1,4&#8208;dithiophenol building blocks provided access to a large diversity of glycoconjugates that could be selected by a lectin in a simple experimental set up to identify glycoconjugates with potential anti&#8208;infectious applications, thus speeding up the discovery of potential new antibacterial treatments.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Pairing Assemblies of Polarized Charged Porphyrin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ion pairs, consisting of the polarized porphyrin AuIII complex as a dipolar &#960;&#8208;electronic cation, formed crystal&#8208;state ion&#8208;pairing assemblies based on antiparallel stacking structures stabilized by dispersion forces along with reduced electrostatic repulsion originating from the dipole&#8211;dipole interactions.








Abstract
A porphyrin AuIII complex comprising 5,10&#8208;penatafluorophenyl units was synthesized as a dipolar &#960;&#8208;electronic cation. The &#960;&#8208;electronic cation was combined with anions, including a bulky borate anion and planar &#960;&#8208;electronic anions. The dipolar &#960;&#8208;electronic cation formed crystal&#8208;state ion&#8208;pairing assemblies based on antiparallel stacking structures, which were stabilized by interionic dipole&#8211;dipole interactions.

         <title>Synergistic Gold&#8208;Silicon Catalysis: Unravelling Alkynyl Gold Reactivity and Application to the High&#8208;Performance C&#8208;Alkynylation of Glycals</title>

         <dc:description>
This research highlights an efficient and highly &#945;&#8208;stereoselective Au&#8208;Si&#8208;catalyzed alkyne transfer reaction from 1&#8208;trimethylsilylalkynes to glycals, utilizing the bench&#8208;stable (F5Ph)3PAuNTf2 complex at low catalyst loadings (0.2&#8211;1 mol%). DFT mechanistic investigations revealed the nucleophilic character of the in situ formed electron&#8208;deficient alkynylgold species and allowed elucidating the full mechanism, including two distinct pathways for its addition to an oxacarbenium electrophile.








Abstract
Within the synergistic gold&#8208;silicon catalysis concept, we have reported here the efficient and highly &#945;&#8208;stereoselective Au&#8208;Si&#8208;catalyzed alkyne transfer from 1&#8208;trimethylsilylalkynes to glycals, at room temperature and at low loading (0.2&#8211;1 mol%). The synthesized and bench&#8208;stable (F5Ph)3PAuNTf2 complex was found instrumental to achieve such C&#8208;alkynylation reaction, through the in situ generation of both trimethylsilyl triflimide and alkynylgold complex from 1&#8208;trimethylsilylalkynes. This coupling has been deployed routinely on a wide combination of glycal donors and as efficiently with either aryl or alkyl 1&#8208;trimethylsilylalkyne aglycons, functionalized or not. This method could also be applied to the synthesis of a pseudo&#8208;C&#8208;disaccharide.
DFT mechanistic investigations confirmed for the first time that alkynylgold species i) exhibit suitable nucleophilic character, even when they carry highly electrophilic ligands, and ii) that they react as &#8220;classical&#8221; organometallics and not through their possible carbenic form in reaction with oxacarbenium electrophiles.

         <title>Tuning Electrocatalytic Energy Release in Norbornadiene&#160;Based Molecular Solar Thermal Systems Through Substituent Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigated how push&#8211;pull substituents influence the electrochemically driven energy release in norbornadiene&#8208;based MOST systems. Electron&#8208;donating groups proved to be decisive, with p&#8208;methoxyphenyl derivatives achieving up to 99% selectivity. These insights offer valuable design guidelines for future MOST systems.








Abstract
Molecular solar thermal (MOST) systems, such as the norbornadiene/quadricyclane (NBD/QC) pair, combine solar energy conversion, storage, and release in a simple one&#8208;molecule process. The energy&#8208;releasing reaction QC to NBD can be controlled electrochemically. In this study, we used in&#8208;situ photoelectrochemical infrared spectroscopy (PEC&#8208;IRRAS) together with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate how electron donating (EDG) and electron withdrawing (EWG) groups in the push&#8208;pull system of the MOST pair affect the electrocatalytic properties of the electrochemically triggered back&#8208;conversion. Specifically, we investigated cyano, tosyl, and methyl ester groups as EWGs, and methoxy, dimethylamine, thioether, and diphenylamine groups located in the para&#8208;position of a phenyl group as EDGs. We characterized the onset potential, electrochemical stability window, and selectivity. We found that these properties strongly depend on the strength of electron donation of the EDG, as it exclusively locates the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and raises its energy level. We obtained the highest selectivity for compounds with p&#8208;methoxyphenyl functionality.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Glycybridin B, a Pharmacophore Screened Candidate for Tubulin Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discovery and first total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;glycybridin B via a five&#8208;step route utilizing a key chalcone intermediate. Initially identified through a pharmacophore screening as a potential tubulin binder, this natural product serves as a tool compound to explore structure&#8208;activity relationships related to microtubule targeting and anticancer potential.








Abstract
Microtubule&#8208;targeting agents (MTAs) represent a pivotal class of therapeutic compounds designed to disrupt microtubule dynamics, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in malignant cells. Nevertheless, their off&#8208;target effects on healthy, rapidly dividing cells result in significant neurotoxicity and myelosuppression. Ongoing research aims to enhance their specificity and identify novel active scaffolds to minimize adverse effects and fight drug resistance. Searching for new potential tubulin binders with a pharmacophore screening method, we identified glycybridin B as a promising natural product. Here, we report the first total synthesis of this compound via a five&#8208;step route, involving a key chalcone intermediate, along with its biological evaluation.

&lt;p&gt;Discovery and first total synthesis of (&#8722;)-glycybridin B via a five-step route utilizing a key chalcone intermediate. Initially identified through a pharmacophore screening as a potential tubulin binder, this natural product serves as a tool compound to explore structure-activity relationships related to microtubule targeting and anticancer potential.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs) represent a pivotal class of therapeutic compounds designed to disrupt microtubule dynamics, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in malignant cells. Nevertheless, their off-target effects on healthy, rapidly dividing cells result in significant neurotoxicity and myelosuppression. Ongoing research aims to enhance their specificity and identify novel active scaffolds to minimize adverse effects and fight drug resistance. Searching for new potential tubulin binders with a pharmacophore screening method, we identified glycybridin B as a promising natural product. Here, we report the first total synthesis of this compound via a five-step route, involving a key chalcone intermediate, along with its biological evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Application of PEG&#8208;functionalized Amphiphilic Pillararene in Drug Delivery Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively summarizes the application of PEG&#8208;functionalized amphiphilic pillararenes in drug delivery systems for chemotherapy, phototherapy, and gas therapy of tumor. Some corresponding examples were discussed in detail to evaluate their performance in chemotherapy, phototherapy, and gas therapy of tumor. At the end, some future developmental directions for PEG&#8208;functionalized amphiphilic pillararenes were also put forward.








Abstract
As a new generation of supramolecular host macrocyclic molecules, pillararenes display many advantages including simple synthesis routes, rigid electron&#8208;rich structures, unique host&#8208;guest interactions, and adjustable cavity sizes, which make them widely be used in drug delivery systems for precise diagnosis and treatment of cancer. The molecular functions of pillararenes can be easily expanded through the introduction of different functional groups into the side chain. For example, polyethylene glycol (PEG) which has good biocompatibility and water solubility can be used to construct PEG&#8208;functionalized amphiphilic pillararenes. These PEG&#8208;functionalized amphiphilic pillararenes can be used to construct the nanocarriers with good water solubility and excellent biocompatibility through their self&#8208;assembly to deliver hydrophobic drugs. Although there are many reviews introducing the application of amphiphilic pillararenes in drug delivery, there are still no comprehensive articles summarizing such type of pillararenes. In this paper, based on their functional characteristics, the applications of PEG&#8208;functionalized amphiphilic pillararene in drug delivery systems have been summarized. We focused on the relationship between their molecular design and functional application, providing reasonable guidance for the structural design of amphiphilic pillararenes.

         <title>Citrate&#8208;Assisted Solvothermal Synthesis of SnO2 Porous Microflowers as Efficient Cathode for Advanced Hybrid Supercapacitor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SnO2 porous microflowers were prepared by a citrate&#8208;mediated solvothermal route along with a post&#8208;annealing treatment in air. Such SnO2 flowers exhibited a battery&#8208;type electrochemical response with a great specific capacity of 177.2 C g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 in 2&#160;M of KOH electrolyte. The assembled SnO2 microflowers//AC hybrid supercapacitor delivered a high specific energy of 29.5&#160;W h kg&#8722;1 at 883.9&#160;W kg&#8722;1.








Abstract
Herein, mesoporous tin dioxide materials with distinct structures (SnO2 microflowers and SnO2 microsheets) were, respectively, prepared via a citrate&#8208;mediated solvothermal route along with a post&#8208;annealing treatment in air. Electrochemical tests revealed a typical battery&#8208;type charge storage behavior of SnO2 materials. Attributing to the 3D hierarchical flower&#8208;like structure and its good conductivity, the SnO2 microflowers possessed a specific capacity of 177.2 C g&#8722;1, slightly greater than 159.0 C g&#8722;1 achieved by SnO2 microsheets under 1 A g&#8722;1. When assembled into hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) utilizing activated carbon (AC) as an anode, the SnO2 microflowers//AC HSC device delivered a high energy density (ED) of 29.5&#160;W h kg&#8722;1 at 883.9&#160;W kg&#8722;1, surpassing SnO2 microsheets//AC HSC (26.9&#160;W h kg&#8722;1 at 881.7&#160;W kg&#8722;1). Furthermore, both SnO2//AC HSCs exhibited long&#8208;term stability, showing 113.2% (SnO2 microflowers//AC) and 106.4% (SnO2 microsheets//AC) capacity retention over 5000 cycles. Notably, this synthesis strategy achieves facile morphological control and improved electrochemical properties of SnO2 materials by adjusting the sodium citrate amount. These results indicate that SnO2 microflowers and SnO2 microsheets are attractive candidates for high&#8208;performance HSC assembly. Furthermore, this cost&#8208;effective approach can provide a reference for synthesizing other advanced metal oxide&#8208;based electrode materials.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;stretchable Transparent Hydrogels with Low Hydrophobic and Amphiphilic Monomers Using Asymmetric Crosslinker to Give Low Mechanical Hysteresis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copolymerizing a low&#8208;hydrophobic monomer and an amphiphilic monomer with an asymmetric crosslinker has led to a transparent, highly stretchable hydrogel. Optimizing the monomer concentration and ratio has led to up to a 19.3 swelling ratio and 1300% stretchability, or over 3000% with slightly reduced transparency, with all hydrogels displaying low hysteresis and rapid contraction.








Abstract
Exploring a reasonable network design to develop highly stretchable hydrogels with over 1,000% extension is still a big challenge in the field of hydrogel chemistry and materials. Micellar copolymerization with hydrophobic monomers and surfactants/proteins is a well&#8208;studied approach to provide stretchable hydrogels with hydrophobic association domains as sacrificial bonds when subjected to large deformation, but some limitations, such as dose increase of such monomers and surfactant&#8208;free synthesis have not yet been well considered. In this study, we demonstrate a simple but powerful approach to produce transparent, ultra&#8208;stretchable hydrogels expressing more than 3,000% elongation by surfactant&#8208;free copolymerization of low hydrophobic monomer and amphiphilic monomer. We believe that this result offers wider availability of low hydrophobic groups in various water&#8208;containing polymer materials, including gels, micelles, etc.

         <title>A Potassium Base&#8208;Promoted Intramolecular Enolate&#8211;Olefin Metathesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel olefin metathesis, the enolate&#8208;olefin metathesis reaction, in which two double bonds recombine via a four&#8208;membered carbocyclic intermediate (NOT metallacyclobutane intermediate), is developed. The methodology is a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, base&#8208;promoted enolate&#8211;olefin metathesis involving [2&#160;+&#160;2] / retro&#8208;[2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition sequences of 2&#8208;acyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;alkenylbiaryl substrates. This reaction enables the synthesis of a wide range of hydroxy&#8208;substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.








Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are important structures known for their unique properties. Herein, we present a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free method for synthesizing hydroxy&#8208;substituted PAHs using base&#8208;promoted intramolecular enolate&#8208;olefin&#8208;metathesis chemistry. 2&#8208;Acyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;alkenylbiaryl substrates were subjected to [2&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;/retro&#8208;[2&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;cycloaddition sequences to afford functionalized PAH derivatives, including enantiomerically enriched [7]helicenes. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predicted that ionic and radical intermediates are involved in a stepwise process. Various biaryl substrates, including heteroatom&#8208;containing compounds, were successfully converted into the desired PAHs. The developed method also enabled the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;extended arenols, thereby offering a sustainable and efficient alternative to transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed processes.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Ligand Cooperation of Ir(III) Catalysts Bearing a &#946;&#8208;Protic Pyrazole Chelate in Carboxylative Cyclization of Propargylic Amine with CO2</title>

         <dc:description>
Proton&#8208;responsive C&#8211;N chelating Cp*Ir complexes derived from 3,5&#8208;diphenylpyrazole catalyze the carboxylative cyclization of propargylic amines with CO2. The cyclic urethane product is smoothly released via protonolysis of the alkenyl&#8208;Ir species with the aid of the &#946;&#8208;protic NH unit on pyrazole. Related nonprotic pyrazole analogs and &#945;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;protic complexes are not catalytically active, but they provide access to catalytic intermediate models.








Abstract
Bifunctional iridium complexes having a &#946;&#8208;protic C&#8211;N chelating pyrazole ligand catalyze the carboxylative cyclization of 1&#8208;methylamino&#8208;2&#8208;butyne under atmospheric CO2. This reaction affords a five&#8208;membered cyclic urethane, along with a six&#8208;membered regioisomer. Alkenyliridium(III) complexes as catalytic intermediate models are formed by stoichiometric reaction of related nonprotic pyrazole complexes with 1&#8208;methylamino&#8208;2&#8208;butyne and CO2 in the presence of Ag2O, although the protic pyrazole analog is too unstable to be detected. In particular, the isolable N&#8208;phenylpyrazole&#8208;ligated alkenyliridium(III) complex with a cyclic urethane framework is characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The &#946;&#8208;protic pyrazole ligand would be capable of accelerating protonolysis of the alkenyl carbon&#8211;iridium bond in the key intermediate, releasing the cyclic urethane product, and being responsible for the catalytic function.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Luminescent Responsive Bilayer Architecture Based on 2D Lanthanide MOFs for Ratiometric NO2 and SO2 Monitoring</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report two novel Lanthanide Coordination Polymers, [Tb2(AATA)3(DMF)4] (1) and [Eu2(AATA)3(DMF)4] (2), with enhanced luminescence. These MOFs were then embedded in PDMS to create a bilayer configuration. We implemented a novel ratiometric approach to achieve highly accurate SO2 detection. 2 serves as an internal reference while 1 act as the SO2&#8208;sensitive component offering high sensitivity, specificity, and a pioneer application of a bilayer system.








Abstract
The development of responsive materials for monitoring atmospheric toxic emissions is a growing area of interest. Luminescent metal&#8208;organic framework (LMOF), particularly those based on lanthanides (LnMOFs), have emerged as promising candidates due to their sharp emission bands, long luminescence lifetimes, and structural versatility. Despite their potential, the integration of LnMOFs into robust solid&#8208;state sensing platforms remains limited. In this study, we report the synthesis of three isostructural LnMOFs &#8208;[Tb2(AATA)3(DMF)4], [Eu2(AATA)3(DMF)4], [Gd2(AATA)3(DMF)4]&#8208; based on the antenna&#8208;type ligand 2,5&#8208;bis(acetylamido)terephthalic acid, which promotes strong lanthanide emission and stable 2D frameworks. The MOFs were successfully embedded into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to produce composite films retaining their luminescent properties in the solid state. We further present a conceptual bilayer configuration with one film acting as a stable internal reference, and the other serving as the analyte&#8208;responsive layer. This bilayer design enables ratiometric luminescence detection, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the measurements. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we demonstrate that the bilayer films exhibit measurable luminescence changes in presence of two major atmospheric pollutants, NO2 and SO2. This result sets a foundational approach for developing more accurate and self&#8208;referencing luminescent materials.

         <title>Metallophthalocyanine&#8208;based Conductive Frameworks as Working Electrode for Dehydrogenase&#8208;Like Electrochemical Oxidation of Thioethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of polymetallophthalocyanines as working electrode achieves dehydrogenase&#8208;like electrochemical oxidation of thioethers with excellent Faradaic efficiency over 96.3% and nearly 100% product distribution to sulfoxides, along with a high conversion rate of 0.238 mmol&#160;h&#8722;1, outperforming carbon paper electrodes.








Abstract
The selection of electrode materials is critical to the reactivity and selectivity for organic electrosynthesis. In this work, we for the first time use polymetallophthalocyanines (pMPcs) as working electrode for the efficient and highly selective oxidation of sulfide. pMPcs was found to be able to mediate sulfide oxidation with dehydrogenase&#8208;like activity, in which water acts as an oxygen source, for a broad substrate scope, including pharmaceuticals. Among the pMPcs electrodes, pFePc exhibits the highest catalytic selectivity with a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 96.3% and nearly 100% product distribution for the oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides, as well as the highest conversion rate of 0.238&#160;mmol h&#8722;1. Studies combining spectroscopic experiments and computational approaches reveal that the mechanism of oxidation of sulfide involves the proton&#8208;coupled oxidation of Fe&#9472;OH2 to generate Fe&#9552;O intermediates on the metal atom of the metal&#8208;N4 units of pMPcs. This work highlights the potential for the application of conductive framework materials in organic&#8208;electrical synthesis.

         <title>Nitroreductase&#8208;Responsive Bioorthogonal Tetrazine Conjugations in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here nitroreductase&#8208;responsive bioorthogonal tetrazine ligations have been demonstrated, enabled by nitrobenzyl caged dihydrotetrazines. By tagging a nitroreductase&#8208;activatable tetrazine precursor with an integrin&#8208;specific peptide c(RGDyK), a dual tumor&#8208;selective on demand bioorthogonal prodrug activation has been achieved in the presence of hypoxic cancer cells.








Abstract
Prodrugs in response to tumor&#8208;overexpressed enzymes offer a targeted approach for cancer therapy. However, this strategy faces several challenges, including poor water solubility, off&#8208;target effects, and tumor heterogeneity. To address these limitations, this study developed a novel class of nitroreductase&#8208;responsive tetrazine precursors by employing nitrobenzyl as a masking group for dihydrotetrazines (NBdTz), which can be further functionalized with targeting peptides. Furthermore, we have demonstrated a dual tumor&#8208;selective on demand bioorthogonal prodrug activation enabled by RGD&#8208;NBdTz. RGD promotes tumor cellular uptake by interacting with tumor&#8208;associated integrin &#945;v&#946;3, and subsequent enzymatic reduction of aromatic nitro group of NBdTz by overexpressed Nitroreductase (NTR) among hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME) leads to the liberation of the bioorthogonal handle tetrazine, resulting in the anticipated bioorthogonal activation of trans&#8208;cyclooctene caged payloads through &#8220;click&#8208;to&#8208;release&#8221; reactions. We envision the presented NBdTz enabled tumor&#8208;selective on demand tetrazine ligation offers new opportunities for cancer therapy.

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Peptoids with Two Different Binding Sites for Strong ATP Chelation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ATP is key for activating enzymes associated with cancer. A potential therapeutic approach is strong binding of ATP, making it unavailable to enzymes. The water&#8208;soluble peptoid P1&#8208;TB incorporates two synergistic binding sites for ATP: terpyridine&#8208;Zn&#178;&#8314; and 4&#8208;CPBA that bind ATP's phosphate and diol groups, respectively, and exhibits an exceptional K&#7429;&#8208;ATP of 7.416&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;9&#160;M, representing a potential ATP chelator.








Abstract
Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) is the activator of many enzymes, including kinases, that play a significant role in various medical conditions such as cancer. Therefore, inhibiting ATP&#8208;dependent enzymes requires to disable its binding to enzymes, and this can be done by developing potent ATP chelators. Currently, there are two main types of chelators: one that binds ATP via zinc complexes of nitrogen&#8208;based ligands, such as 2,2&#8242;;6&#8242;,2&#8243;&#8208;terpyridine (Terpy), which target&#160;the phosphate ligands, and another one containing phenylboronic acid (PBA) to bind the diols within the ribose. Herein, we report on a unique chelation approach that combines these two binding strategies in one scaffold; we use peptidomimetic oligomers called peptoids that incorporate both Zn(Terpy) and PBA as strong, water&#8208;soluble ATP binding inhibitors. These peptoids demonstrated high affinity to ATP, where the highest is KD&#8208;ATP&#160;=&#160;7.416&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;9&#160;M, four times higher than the binding affinity of peptoids targeting only phosphates or only diols, and at least two orders of magnitude higher than known ATP chelators. Structural studies indicated that positioning both Terpy and PBA side chains close together on the scaffold increased ATP binding affinity, compared to spacing them apart.

&lt;p&gt;ATP is key for activating enzymes associated with cancer. A potential therapeutic approach is strong binding of ATP, making it unavailable to enzymes. The water-soluble peptoid P1-TB incorporates two synergistic binding sites for ATP: terpyridine-Zn&#178;&#8314; and 4-CPBA that bind ATP's phosphate and diol groups, respectively, and exhibits an exceptional K&lt;i&gt;&#7429;&lt;/i&gt;-ATP of 7.416&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;9&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;M, representing a potential ATP chelator.

         <title>Crown Ether Supported Alkali Metal Phosphides: Synthesis, Structures and Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crowned! Herein we describe a complete series of crown ether coordinated alkali metal phosphides from lithium to cesium, including solid state structures, detailed investigations in solution and extensive quantum chemical investigation of the bonding situation.








Abstract
Herein we present the synthesis and full characterization of the previously unpresented lithium diphenyl phosphides Li(15&#8208;crown&#8208;5)PPh2 (1Li) and Li(12&#8208;crown&#8208;4)PPh2 (2Li) as well as the heavy homologues Rb(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)PPh2 (1Rb) and Cs(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)PPh2 (1Cs). We thus complete the series of crown ether coordinated alkali metal diphenyl phosphides and reveal that the structural diversity increases upon descending the group. Including the previously reported Na and K derivatives, we performed a detailed study of the title compounds in solution that strongly indicated all of them are monomers with an alkali metal phosphide AM&#8211;P interaction. We further investigated the influence of the phosphorus&#8208;bound substituents on the bond between the Cs(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6) and the phosphide fragment. For this purpose, we synthesized and characterized two new cesium phosphides, alkyl&#8208;aryl Cs(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)PtBuPh (4Cs) and bis&#8208;alkyl Cs(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)PtBu2 (5Cs). We observed here that the heavy alkali metals Rb and Cs favor coordination via &#960;&#8208;arene interactions&#160;over the P donor dative interactions. Finally, we used state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum chemical methods to analyze the bonding situation in the title series of compounds.

         <title>Fine Tuning of the Redox&#8208;Active Diguanidine Ligand in Cationic Cobalt Complexes for Electronic Structure Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidation in Co complexes with redox&#8208;active diguanidine ligands is either ligand&#8208; or metal&#8208;centered, leading to paramagnetic high&#8208;spin CoII complexes with radical monocationic diguanidine ligands or low&#8208;spin CoIII redox isomers with neutral diguanidine ligands. Careful ligand design leads to the energetic harmonization of the two redox isomers and realization of one&#8208;electron oxidation processes that are both metal&#8208; and ligand&#8208;centered.








Abstract
In this work we show that the redox chemistry of hexacoordinated cobalt complexes with redox&#8208;active diguanidine ligands could be tuned by modifying the diguanidine and/or the co&#8208;ligands. In this way, one&#8208;electron oxidation could be directed to be either ligand&#8208; or metal&#8208;centered, leading to high&#8208;spin CoII complexes with an oxidized, radical&#8208;monocationic diguanidine ligand (ligand&#8208;centered oxidation) or low&#8208;spin CoIII complexes with a reduced, neutral diguanidine ligand. Further fine&#8208;tuning of the redox&#8208;active diguanidine ligand leads to a harmonization of the energies of both redox isomers. Consequently, ligand&#8208; as well as metal&#8208;centered one&#8208;electron oxidation is observed, resulting in a mixture of both redox isomers. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations confirm the energetic proximity of the two redox isomers in this bistable system. The results of this work contribute to the development of a directed approach toward the design of bistable cobalt&#8208;guanidine complexes and their possible applications in spin&#8208;switching devices.

         <title>Spacer Group Modified Naphthalimide with Acidichromism and Mechanochromism for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P1 powder shows no fluorescence because of PET between tertiary amines and naphthalimide. P1&#8208;HCl powder exhibits bright blue emission because HCl can bind onto the lone&#8208;pair electrons of trimethylamine to prevent PET. The highly twisted conformation of P1&#8208;HCl has enough steric effect, contributing to obvious red&#8208;shifted mechanochromism.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescence materials are crucial in developing intelligent materials and have wide applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption. However, organic fluorescence dyes with strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; intermolecular interactions and dense molecular packing lead to inertia ability of stimuli&#8208;responsive. Here, we design and synthesize spacer group modified naphthalimide compounds (P1 and P2) with acidichromism and mechanochromism properties. Photoinduced electron transfer (PET) between naphthalimide and trimethylamine moieties quenches fluorescence of P1 and P2. Then, fluorescence is obtained when P1 and P2 interact with hydrochloric acid (named P1&#8208;HCl and P2&#8208;HCl). More importantly, the spacer group modified P1&#8208;HCl with a highly twisted conformation, preventing strong intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions and a compact packing structure, contributing to obvious mechanochromism, while P2&#8208;HCl does not. Our study provides a molecular strategy to investigate the relationship between molecular chemical structure and stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescence properties and realizes anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.

         <title>Indole&#8208;2&#8208;Carboxylic Acid Ligand&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Stable Perovskite Nanocrystals for Fast Responsive Photodetector</title>

Stable CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 mixed NCs synthesized by using ICA ligand effectively enhances the Photoluminescence (PL) and PLQY. These mixed nanocrystals show high responsivity in prototype photodetector device.








Abstract
Cesium lead bromide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) show great potential for photoelectric properties. However, due to their poor stability and the insulating nature of passivating ligands, they suffer from practical applications. Herein, in an approach to passivate the NCs surface by introducing a ligand, Indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid (ICA), we synthesized a mixed CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 NCs by a ligand&#8208;assisted reprecipitation approach. Incorporating the ICA ligand in place of long&#8208;chain insulating Oleic acid (OA) effectively reduced the loss of nonradiative recombination induced by surface trap states. Through all the performed compositional and structural characterization, the existence of CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 mixed NCs was confirmed. The obtained CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 mixed NCs show green emission at 518&#160;nm and superior stability under ambient conditions compared to CsPbBr3 NCs. The photoluminescence (PL) of the CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 mixed NCs increased approximately three times, and the PL quantum yield (PLQY) increased from 75&#160;&#177;&#160;2% to 94&#160;&#177;&#160;2% as compared to CsPbBr3 NCs. To demonstrate the potential application of the material in optoelectronics, a photodetector based on mixed CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 NCs is fabricated, which exhibits the maximum responsivity of 1.133&#160;mA/W at 9&#160;mW/cm2 incident power density and faster rise and fall times of 0.31&#160;ms and 1.19&#160;ms, respectively. The specific detectivity of the device is 1.608&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8313; Jones with an incident power of 9&#160;mW/cm2.

Herein, in an approach to passivate the NCs surface by introducing a ligand, Indole-2-carboxylic acid (ICA), we synthesized a mixed CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Cs&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; NCs by a ligand-assisted reprecipitation approach. Incorporating the ICA ligand in place of long-chain insulating Oleic acid (OA) effectively reduced the loss of nonradiative recombination induced by surface trap states. Through all the performed compositional and structural characterization, the existence of CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Cs&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; mixed NCs was confirmed. The obtained CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Cs&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; mixed NCs show green emission at 518&#160;nm and superior stability under ambient conditions compared to CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; NCs. The photoluminescence (PL) of the CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Cs&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; mixed NCs increased approximately three times, and the PL quantum yield (PLQY) increased from 75&#160;&#177;&#160;2% to 94&#160;&#177;&#160;2% as compared to CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; NCs. To demonstrate the potential application of the material in optoelectronics, a photodetector based on mixed CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Cs&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; NCs is fabricated, which exhibits the maximum responsivity of 1.133&#160;mA/W at 9&#160;mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; incident power density and faster rise and fall times of 0.31&#160;ms and 1.19&#160;ms, respectively. The specific detectivity of the device is 1.608&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8313; Jones with an incident power of 9&#160;mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Hyperbranched Polyurethane Acrylate as Self&#8208;cleaning Protective Film on Solar Panel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyperbranched polyurethane acrylate (PHBA) was synthesized and blended with epoxy acrylate (EB600) to fabricate protective coatings for solar panels. The multifunctional coating exhibits satisfactory comprehensive properties, significantly prolonging the service life of solar panels. The research provides a feasible strategy for manufacturing high&#8208;performance protective coatings.








Abstract
Renewable and green energy technologies, particularly the improvement of solar panel efficiency, have gained considerable attention in academic and industrial communities. However, long&#8208;term exposure to soiling can lead to substantial reduction in the energy generation capacity of photovoltaic systems. Here, hyperbranched polyurethane acrylate (PHBA) was synthesized using hydroxyl&#8208;terminated hyperbranched polyester as a core component. PHBA was subsequently blended with epoxy acrylate (EB600) and rapidly UV&#8208;cured to fabricate protective coatings for solar panels. The polymeric coating exhibited outstanding mechanical properties, including tensile strength of about 65.43 MPa, the elongation at break of about 3.73%, adhesion of 1 level, and pencil hardness of 6H. The hyperbranched topological structure can remarkably improve the mechanical properties and extend the service life of solar panels. Moreover, the uniform dispersion of siloxane coupling agent in the polymer matrix improved hydrophobic properties, which effectively reduced dust deposition and maintained voltage stability. The high&#8208;performance polymeric coating has shown great application potential in solar panel protective films.

         <title>Enhanced Seawater Oxygen Evolution with Improved Electronic Environment of NiCoPS Through Fluorine Doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the F&#8208;doped NiCoPS nanowires were synthesized&#160;as a high&#8208;performance catalyst for seawater oxygen evolution. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the strongly electronegative fluorine improves the surface electronic structure of NiCoPS, further enhancing the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates and electronic conductivity. This work provides an efficient strategy to design effective and durable oxygen evolution reaction(OER) electrocatalysts in alkaline seawater.








Abstract
Developing economical and robust electrocatalysts to prevent chlorine&#160;ions corrosion and improve seawater splitting efficiency is essential for seawater electrolysis. Herein, fluorine&#8208;doped nickel cobalt phospho&#8208;sulfide nanowires (F&#8208;NiCoPS NWs) were synthesized as high&#8208;performance catalysts for overall seawater splitting. The strongly electronegative F anion is favorable to build weak metal fluorine bonds, which easily break to generate highly active species of Ni/Co&#8208;hydroxides/oxyhydroxides protective layer on the electrode surface. This process effectively avoids chlorine evolution reaction (ClER)&#8208;induced dissolution, and enhances the stability of catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the electronegative fluorine affects the electronic structure of the catalyst&#8217; surface, further enhancing the adsorption energy and electronic conductivity of the reaction intermediates. F&#8208;NiCoPS with appropriate F doping significantly decreased the overpotential (228 (303) mV at 10 (100)&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and the Tafel slope (44&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1) in alkaline seawater, and exhibited a long stability of 100&#160;hours. This work provides new insights for constructing effective, cost&#8208;efficient, and nonnoble metal electrocatalyst for alkaline seawater splitting.

         <title>1,3&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;Zwitterionic Complexes of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes in Reactions with Arylallenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New examples of (3&#160;+&#160;2)&#8208;cycloaddition and annulation reactions of Donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes (DACs) with 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;methylallenes in the presence of GaCl3 were demonstrated. The starting DACs act in these processes as the source of 1,3&#8208; or 1,2&#8208;zwitterionic intermediates. Substituted 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;(inden&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethylmalonates, tetrahydrobenzo[c]fluorenylmalonates, and exo&#8208;methylenecyclopentane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates were obtained with high diastereoselectivity and good yields.








Abstract
The reaction of 2&#8208;arylcyclopropane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates (ACDC) with GaCl3 and other Lewis acids in the presence of 3&#8208;arylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;dienes, which acts as a trapping agent for the 1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;zwitterionic intermediates being generated, has been studied. The reaction of 1,2&#8208;zwitterionic gallium complexes at low temperature has been found to give products of annulation at the phenyl substituent in the allene, 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;(inden&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethylmalonates, as the main products. Only in the case of naphthylcyclopropanedicarboxylate, the formation of a polycyclic frame by annulation at both aromatic moieties occurred upon an increase in temperature to 0 &#176;C. Trapping of 1,3&#8208;zwitterions, the primary intermediates of cyclopropane ring opening, by the indicated allene was most successful if catalytic amounts of GaCl3 were added directly to the reaction mixture. In this case, the reaction followed the pathway of the usual formal (3&#160;+&#160;2)&#8208;cycloaddition of 1,3&#8208;zwitterions at each of the double bonds of the allene to give the corresponding exo&#8208;methylenecyclopentane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates in up to 93% yields. This process occurred with the highest efficiency at the unsubstituted double bond of 3&#8208;arylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;diene.

         <title>Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP) Reactivity from Carbone&#8211;BPh3 Lewis Adduct</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP) reactivity toward the activation of various small molecules and the catalytic reduction of ketones have been demonstrated using a carbodicarbene (CDC)&#9472;BPh3 adduct. Mechanistic studies, including NMR exchange spectroscopy and DFT calculations, reveal that reversible adduct dissociation generates a transient encounter complex essential for the observed FLP&#8208;type reactivity.








Abstract
We present a systematic investigation of the Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP) chemistry of carbodicarbenes (fCDCs) featuring varied steric profiles in combination with strong (B(C6F5)3, BCF) and weak (BPh3) boron Lewis acids. The resulting CDC&#8211;borane systems display a full spectrum of behaviors: (i) tightly bound Lewis adducts lacking FLP reactivity, (ii) adducts exhibiting reversible dissociation and activate small molecules via FLP&#8208;type reactivity, and (iii) a &#8220;classical&#8221; FLP that remain unbound. The most reactive Lewis adduct, 1&#183;BPh3, which exhibits the lowest dissociation energy, activates a broad range of bonds (C&#9472;H, O&#9472;H, N&#9472;H, H&#9472;B, H&#9472;Si, S&#9472;S, and CO2) and catalyzes hydroboration and hydrosilylation of ketones under mild, metal&#8208;free conditions. NMR exchange spectroscopy and DFT calculations reveal that its FLP reactivity originates from reversible dissociation and the formation of a reactive transient encounter complex. These findings establish carbone&#8208;based Lewis adducts as tunable platforms for FLP&#8208;type small molecule activation and main&#8208;group catalysis, where reactivity can be regulated through steric and electronic modulation.

         <title>Zinc(II) Monomeric, Dimeric, and Trimeric Photosensitizers with Microsecond&#8208;Lived Intra&#8208;Ligand Charge Transfer Excited States Investigated Through Time&#8208;Resolved Optical and X&#8208;Ray Spectroscopy</title>

An array of spectroscopic methods including femto&#8208;nanosecond optical transient absorption and nanosecond X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopies resolve the singlet intraligand charge transfer (1ILCT) and triplet (3ILCT) states in a family of Monomeric, Dimeric, and Trimeric Zn&#8208;based photosensitizers with phenanthroline&#8208;derived ligands. These results are crucial toward suggesting designs of new Zn&#8208;based complexes that can be employed for energy transfer and photoredox catalytic reactions.








Abstract
ZnII photosensitizers relative to CuI complexes have received less attention due to their energetically higher metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer states. Three ZnII complexes, namely a Monomer, a bimetallic helicate, and a trimetallic helicate, bearing phenanthroline ligands are hereby studied through time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray absorption (tr&#8208;XAS) and femto&#8208;microsecond optical transient absorption spectroscopy (OTA). The formation of intraligand singlet charge transfer (IILCT) excited states is achieved within femtoseconds, followed by intersystem crossing (ISC) in nanoseconds to generate microsecond&#8208;lived triplet (3ILCT) states. Femtosecond OTA shows that the 1ILCT states in the Monomer, Dimer, and Trimer occur within 235 fs, 683 fs, and 730 fs, respectively, while nano&#8208;microsecond OTA and tr&#8208;XAS show their 3ILCT states to decay within 1.00 &#181;s, 1.48 &#181;s, and 1.51 &#181;s. The ISC from the 1ILCT to the 3ILCT state for the Trimer is 42.8&#160;ns compared to the Monomer and Dimer with ISC rates of less than 13&#160;ns. These differences arise due to the stabilization by &#960;&#8208;&#960; and CH&#8208;&#960; noncovalent interactions of the phenanthroline ligands. The dihedral and torsional angles indicate stronger ligand strains in the excited states of the Dimer and Trimer versus the Monomer. DFT calculations for the electrochemical oxidation potentials further highlight their capability in inducing photoredox processes.

         <title>A Fluorinated Anodic Aluminum Oxide Nanopores Coating Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Self&#8208;healing Triboelectrification and Anti&#8208;corrosion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triboelectric nanogenerator with the surface of alumina nanostructures by anodic oxidation method was prepared. Compared to TENG with aluminum sheets, TENG with alumina nanopores has higher triboelectric output. Low surface energy compounds loaded in alumina nanopores can migrate to the surface to achieve a triboelectrification self&#8208;healing property. In addition to supplying energy such as lighting, the electrical energy collected with TENG can also be used to protect carbon steel against corrosion through self&#8208;powered cathodic protection.








Abstract
The triboelectric layer is a key component affecting the performance of a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). Herein, a TENG with a triboelectric layer possessing a fluorinated&#8208;anodic&#8208;alumina&#8208;nanopores structure was prepared. The nanopores structure can increase the contact area and thus increase the triboelectric output. The fluorination treatment further increased the output. The current output of this TENG is 10.4&#160;&#181;A, while that of the TENG with a pristine&#8208;aluminum&#8208;based triboelectric layer is 3.7&#160;&#181;A. The ability of the low&#8208;surface&#8208;energy compounds loaded in the alumina nanopores to migrate to the surface leads to a triboelectrification self&#8208;healing property. In addition to supplying energy such as lighting, the electrical energy collected with TENG can also be used to protect carbon steel against corrosion through self&#8208;powered cathodic protection.

         <title>In Quest for Polyenic Macrolactam JBIR&#8208;150 Identity: Stereoselective Synthesis of DP4+&#8208;Based Purported Structure and Biogenetically Inspired Positional Stereoisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The DP4+&#8208;predicted (8R,10R,19R)&#8208;JBIR&#8208;150 stereoisomer and the C11&#8208;epimeric structures of iso&#8208;JBIR&#8208;150 with the hydroxyl groups located at the odd&#8208;numbered positions (C9 and C11) as biogenetically inspired by the collinearity principle of their modular sequence, namely (9S,11S,19R)&#8208;iso&#8208;JBIR&#8208;150&#8208;1 and (9S,11R,19R)&#8208;iso&#8208;JBIR&#8208;150&#8208;2, were stereoselectively synthesized, but the NMR data did not match those of the natural product, which keeps its structure undetermined.








Abstract
Total synthesis of polyenic macrolactam JBIR&#8208;150 with all&#8208;trans geometries, hydroxyl substituents located at C8 and C10 and 8R,10R,19R absolute configuration, the most likely stereoisomer predicted by DP4+ calculations, was completed. The formal syn&#8208;1,3&#8208;diol was synthesized iteratively by enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective Krische's allylation reactions. The construction of the conjugated triene units was based on a Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of the corresponding alkenylboronates and alkenyliodides, and Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons (HWE) condensation reactions. Macrolactam formation promoted by HATU and DIPEA was best carried out by amine protecting group exchange and release of both reactive functional groups under basic conditions. Given the lack of correspondence of the 1H&#8208; and 13C&#8208;NMR data for the synthetic and purported JBIR&#8208;150, the hydroxyl groups of JBIR&#8208;150 were alternatively proposed to be located at the odd&#8208;numbered positions (C9, C11) based on the general biogenesis of the family of polyenic macrolactams and the collinearity principle of their modular sequence. The C11&#8208;diastereoisomers of the biogenetically inspired 9,11&#8208;dihydroxy positional isomers (termed iso&#8208;JBIR&#8208;150) with formal syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;diol configurations were completed. Much to our dismay, the NMR data of the synthetic diastereomeric polyenic macrolactams with 9S,11S,19R or 9S,11R,19R absolute configuration did not match those of the natural product, and the structural identity of JBIR&#8208;150 remains undetermined.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent N6 versus Cvinyl Arylation of 8&#8208;Vinyl Adenine Nucleosides, Sequential Diarylation, Fluorescence Properties, and Computational Evaluations**</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed aryl amination and Heck arylation reactions are complementary transformations, generally requiring a suitable catalyst combination and a base. With substrates containing both an amino group and a vinyl moiety, control of C&#9472;N versus C&#9472;C reactivity can lead to regiodivergent functionalizations. With this focus, reactions of silyl&#8208;protected 8&#8208;vinyl 2'&#8208;deoxyadenosine and adenosine with aryl bromides and iodides have been studied. Pd(OAc)2, Pd2(dba)3, and preformed dichloro[1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis(di&#8208;t&#8208;butylphosphino)ferrocene]palladium (II) (Pd&#8208;118) were evaluated as metal sources. Ligands tested were Xantphos, DPEphos, BIPHEP, and DPPF, with Cs2CO3 and K3PO4 as bases. In toluene as solvent, the Pd(OAc)2/Xantphos/Cs2CO3 combination was uniquely capable of predominant N6 arylation. Aryl bromides and iodides gave comparable product yields. Replacement of Cs2CO3 with K3PO4 redirected arylation from the nitrogen atom to the vinyl carbon atom, and all other catalyst, ligand, and base combinations gave Cvinyl arylation as well. Simply switching from Pd(OAc)2 to Pd2(dba)3 resulted in loss of the N6&#8208;selectivity and Cvinyl arylation was favored. Based upon these results, using two structurally similar catalytic systems sequential Cvinyl and N6 arylations of the nucleosides were accomplished. Some of the products were converted to other novel nucleoside analogues. Because some compounds were fluorescent, their photophysical properties were assessed experimentally and computationally.

In toluene as solvent, the Pd(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Xantphos/Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; combination was uniquely capable of predominant &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; arylation. Aryl bromides and iodides gave comparable product yields. Replacement of Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; redirected arylation from the nitrogen atom to the vinyl carbon atom, and all other catalyst, ligand, and base combinations gave C&lt;sup&gt;vinyl&lt;/sup&gt; arylation as well. Simply switching from Pd(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to Pd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(dba)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; resulted in loss of the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-selectivity and C&lt;sup&gt;vinyl&lt;/sup&gt; arylation was favored. Based upon these results, using two structurally similar catalytic systems sequential C&lt;sup&gt;vinyl&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; arylations of the nucleosides were accomplished. Some of the products were converted to other novel nucleoside analogues. Because some compounds were fluorescent, their photophysical properties were assessed experimentally and computationally.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Harnessing the Biosynthetic Diversity of Actinomycetes: Discovery of Unique Natural Products Through Comparative Genomic and Metabolic Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comparative analysis of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (sBGCs) in Actinomycetes revealed that Pseudonocardiaceae strains possess abundant, diverse, and strain&#8208;specific sBGCs. Molecular networking&#8208;based strategy identified lentindoles A and B, novel peptides with rare 6/5/6 and 6/5/5 tricyclic scaffolds, as strain&#8208;specific metabolites from a Lentzea strain. This approach offers a promising strategy for discovering novel natural products.








Abstract
Actinomycetes, rich in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), are important sources of natural products (NPs). However, the rate of discovering novel NPs from actinomycetes has declined, indicating the need for a new strategy to obtain NPs. Herein, we present a strategy for the efficient discovery of novel NPs. First, we performed a comprehensive analysis of BGCs in actinomycetes, evaluating the average number and types of BGCs per genus to identify prolific NP producers. Our analysis revealed that certain actinomycete strains, such as those in the family Pseudonocardiaceae, possess a greater number of BGCs than Streptomyces. In addition, these strains tend to possess strain&#8208;specific BGCs compared with others. To facilitate the identification of strain&#8208;specific compounds, we developed a comparative metabolic analysis method using molecular networking. Applying this method to eight Pseudonocardiaceae strains, we successfully discovered two novel peptides, lentindoles A (1) and B (2), featuring a 6/5/6 and 6/5/5 tricyclic ring system, respectively, along with their possible biosynthetic precursor, lentindole C (3). Our result demonstrates the effectiveness of our developed strategy, which is expected to accelerate the discovery of novel NPs.

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Cytotoxic Evaluation of New Structurally Simplified and Highly Potent Third&#8208;Generation Tubulysin Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed the first solid&#8208;phase synthesis of novel third&#8208;generation tubulin inhibitors without tubuvaline and tubuphenylalanine fragments, earlier considered essential for anticancer activities. The simplified tubulysin derivatives obtained in high yields have shown potent cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines from prostate, lung, breast, cervical, and skin cancers with IC50 values in the low nM range (IC50 = 13&#8211;53&#160;nM).








Abstract
Tubulysins belong to a class of natural products originally isolated from myxobacteria culture and are known to induce cell apoptosis through inhibition of microtubule assembly. Herein, we report the computationally designed, structurally simplified, and first solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis of novel third&#8208;generation tubulin inhibitors in high yields. These inhibitors are devoid of tubuvaline and tubuphenylalanine fragments previously considered essential for tubulin inhibition activity. The most potent inhibitor contains four fragments arranged from the N terminal to the C terminal as N&#8208;methyl pipecolic acid, isoleucine, valine&#8208;thiazole, and asparagine. The hydrophilic tubulin inhibitors demonstrated significant anticancer activity, with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range (IC50 = 13&#8211;53&#160;nM) within a 48&#160;hours incubation period across prostate, lung, breast, skin, and cervical cancer cell lines. The synthetic strategy incorporates a simplified valine&#8208;thiazole ring structure, retaining both biological activity and chiral integrity of the molecules. The method enables the synthesis of potent tubulin inhibitors by avoiding multistep synthetic and purification procedures, supporting the inhibitor's applicability for large&#8208;scale synthesis and potential therapeutic development. The structural modifications at the N&#8208;terminal result in the loss of activity from nM to &#181;M range, whereas the C&#8208;terminal modification had minimal impact on the potency.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Phosphorescence of a Trans&#8208;Bis(iminomethylpyrolato)Platinum Complex Bearing a Polymethylene Vaulted Structure: Chain Length&#8211;Dependent Solid&#8208;State Emissions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platinum(II) complexes featuring a vaulted polymethylene bridge exhibit efficient AIE. An odd&#8208;even effect in chain length is also observed in the AIE behavior, where strong phosphorescence emerges from dimer formation in crystals. Theoretical calculations imply that dimerization raises the MECP, suppressing nonradiative decay.








Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) has recently attracted considerable attention. Although phosphorescent transition&#8208;metal complexes exhibit significant potential as aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens), their exploration and utilization have remained limited, partly due to the insufficient understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Here, we report a new series of platinum(II) complexes, trans&#8208;bis(2&#8208;iminomethylpyrrolato)platinum derivatives (1a&#8211;d), which feature vaulted polymethylene chains of varying lengths (n&#160;=&#160;9&#8211;12) that bridge over the metal atom. Notably, racemic complexes 1b and 1d (with chain lengths of 10 and 12) exhibit strong yellow emission in the crystalline state (quantum yields of 24% and 33%, respectively), despite showing no emission in solution. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed face&#8208;to&#8208;face dimer packing in these emissive crystals, suggesting that dimer formation contributes to their enhanced emission. In contrast, complexes with odd&#8208;numbered chain lengths (1a and 1c) showed no such emission enhancement. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the minimum energy crossing point (MECP) between the excited triplet and ground state lies at significantly higher energy in the dimeric structure than in the monomer, suggesting suppression of nonradiative decay in the crystalline state. This work provides a design strategy for inducing solid&#8208;state phosphorescence by controlling the 3D molecular structure to facilitate favorable molecular stacking while suppressing nonradiative decay pathways.

         <title>Vacancy Engineering of Fe&#8208;Doped CoNi2S4@CC Boosting the Oxygen Evolution Reaction and Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have synthesized Fe&#8208;doped CoNi2S4@CC with sulfur vacancies (Fe&#8208;CoNi2S4&#8208;x@CC). The catalyst exhibited excellent OER and overall water splitting performance, which is attributed to the fact that vacancy engineering and iron doping synergistically promote charge transfer to enhance the catalyst performance.








Abstract
Transition metal sulfides have emerged as promising alternatives to precious metal catalysts for sustainable electrocatalytic hydrogen production. However, achieving simultaneous optimization of active site exposure and vacancy&#8208;electron interplay remains a critical challenge. Herein, we develop a dual&#8208;regulation strategy integrating Fe&#8208;doping and high&#8208;temperature annealing to synthesize sulfur&#8208;deficient Fe&#8208;doped CoNi2S4@CC nanocatalysts (Fe&#8208;CoNi2S4&#8208;x@CC). The approach innovatively combines heteroatom doping and vacancy engineering, where iron doping leads to lattice dilation and sulfur vacancies create vacancy defects, thereby exposing a large number of active sites. The designed catalysts have iron&#8208;induced charge redistribution and vacancy tailored adsorption energies synergistically in the dual active center and expose more active sites to accelerate charge transfer. Intriguingly, the Fe&#8208;CoNi2S4&#8208;x@CC achieves a low overpotential of 194.72 mV@10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline media, surpassing most reported CoNi&#8208;based sulfides. More remarkably, it demonstrates exceptional kinetics with a Tafel slope of 43.2&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 and enhanced active site utilization evidenced by its high electrochemical double layer capacitance value (31.3 mF cm&#8722;2). This work presents a significant advance for the rational design of high&#8208;performance OER catalysts by demonstrating a synergistic modulation strategy that integrates cation doping and vacancy engineering in Fe&#8208;doped CoNi2S4@CC, which not only optimizes the electronic structure but also increases the rate of charge transfer to enhance the catalytic activity.

More remarkably, it demonstrates exceptional kinetics with a Tafel slope of 43.2&#160;mV dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and enhanced active site utilization evidenced by its high electrochemical double layer capacitance value (31.3 mF cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). This work presents a significant advance for the rational design of high-performance OER catalysts by demonstrating a synergistic modulation strategy that integrates cation doping and vacancy engineering in Fe-doped CoNi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@CC, which not only optimizes the electronic structure but also increases the rate of charge transfer to enhance the catalytic activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Affordable Automated Modules for Lab&#8208;Scale High&#8208;Throughput Synthesis of Inorganic Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semi&#8208;automated high&#8208;throughput synthesis station, developed within the MAITENA platform, features two modular units: one for solid&#8208;state and wet&#8208;chemistry routes (ceramic, sol&#8208;gel, Pechini), and another for microwave&#8208;assisted solvothermal synthesis. It enables reproducible workflows, phase diagram exploration, and morphology control, demonstrated on Li&#8208;ion battery materials.








Abstract
The development of sustainable advanced materials is increasingly driven by the need for sustainable, faster, scalable, and more efficient research workflows. Advancements in computational screening, high&#8208;throughput experimentation, and artificial intelligence (AI) are accelerating progress in materials discovery. To fully leverage the benefits of these complementary approaches, the implementation of materials acceleration platforms (MAPs) and self&#8208;driving laboratories (SDL) has emerged as a promising strategy. Here, we present the development of a semi&#8208;automated station for the lab&#8208;scale high&#8208;throughput synthesis (HTS) of inorganic materials, as part of the Materials Acceleration and Innovation plaTform for ENergy Applications (MAITENA). The system integrates two in&#8208;house&#8208;designed liquid&#8208;handling modules capable of performing sol&#8208;gel, Pechini, solid&#8208;state, and hydro/solvothermal syntheses. Each module enables the preparation of several dozen gram&#8208;scale samples per week with high reproducibility and minimal manual intervention. The system's capabilities are demonstrated through three case studies involving Li&#8208;ion battery materials. Results highlight the module's utilization for efficient screening of compositions and synthesis conditions to vary materials&#8217; properties. This accessible and modular infrastructure offers a practical route to implementing high&#8208;throughput strategies in inorganic materials research.

         <title>Enhanced Reactivity of N&#8208;heterocyclic Halophosphines and Phosphenium Cations: The Activation of Carbon&#9472;Heteroatom and Boron&#9472;Heteroatom Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Novel class of saturated NHPs with phosphoramidothioate substituents exhibit enhanced reactivity in photoinitiated transfer hydrogenation reactions and activate C&#9472;O, B&#9472;H, B&#9472;C, and B&#9472;F bonds via phosphenium cation formation.








Abstract
N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphines (NHPs), and especially their ionic derivatives, phosphenium cations, have gained significant attention not only as isoelectronic species to N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) but mainly, as highly Lewis acidic, active organocatalysts. A novel type of saturated NHPs has been introduced, with the nitrogen atoms substituted by phosphoramidothioates&#8211;{[&#954;2&#8208;O,O&#8208;(OCH2C(Me)2CH2O)P(= S)]2&#8208;&#956;&#8208;[NCH2CH2N]}PX, where X&#160;=&#160;F, Cl, Br, I, H, Ph, and their derivatives. Thanks to an increased positive charge at the P(III) atom, these compounds are prone to activate C&#9472;O, B&#9472;H, B&#9472;C, or B&#9472;F bonds and open cyclic ethers through the formation of intermediate species&#8211;phosphenium cations. The hydrido derivative can effectively catalyze the transfer hydrogenation of azobenzene by ammonia borane when irradiated by UV light at room temperature. The self&#8208;ionization of the iodido derivative promoted by the coordination of less sterically demanding N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene enables the isolation of a phosphenium cation.

         <title>Cooperative B&#9472;H Bond Activation: A Direct Route to Monometallic Diborane(5) and Dihydroborate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of hemilabile ligands in &#954;2&#8208;N,E&#8208;chelated iridium and rhodium complexes on small molecule activation has been systematically investigated (E = S or Se). These complexes facilitate B&#9472;H bond activation, leading to the formation of diborane(5) and dihydroborate species (see picture).








Abstract
To study the role of hemilabile ligands in B&#9472;H bond activation, &#954;2&#8208;N,E&#8208;chelated iridium and rhodium complexes, [Cp*M(&#954;1&#8208;E&#8208;C5H4NE)(&#954;2&#8208;N,E&#8208;C5H4NE)] (2a: M = Ir, E = S; 2b: M = Ir, E = Se; 2c: M = Rh, E = S; 2b: M = Rh, E = Se) have been synthesized by salt metathesis reactions of [Cp*MCl2]2 (1a: M = Ir, 1a: M = Rh) and potassium salts of thio&#8208;/seleno&#8208;pyridine ligands. The strained four&#8208;membered rings in 2a&#8208;d indicate their potential for activating small molecules. Indeed, treatment of 2a&#8208;b with [BH3&#8901;THF] afforded monometallic diborane(5) complexes, [(Cp*IrIIIH){&#954;3&#8208;B,B,Se&#8208;(B2H4&#8208;C5H4NE)}] (3a: E = S, 3b: E = Se) and transition metal (TM)&#8208;dihydroborate complexes, [(&#951;4&#8208;C5Me5H)IrI{&#954;2&#8208;H,H,E&#8208;(H3B&#8208;C5H4NE))] (4a: E = S, 4b: E = Se). Complexes 3a&#8208;b, containing a [Cp*IrH] unit, stabilize the non&#8208;classical [B2H4(C5H4NE)]&#8722; fragment, presumably generated through B&#9472;H activation at the Ir&#9472;N bond and subsequent dehydrogenation. In contrast, the Rh analogues 2c&#8208;d yielded dihydroborate rhodium(I) complexes, [(&#951;4&#8208;C5Me5H)RhI{&#954;3&#8208;H,H,E&#8208;(H3B&#8208;C5H4NE)}] (4c: E = S, 4d: E = Se) through B&#9472;H bond insertion into the Rh&#9472;N bonds followed by cyclopentadienyl ring slippage. In an attempt to synthesize a rhodium analogue of 3b, complex 4d is treated with [BH3&#8901;THF] which generated an unsymmetrical bis&#8208;zwitterionic rhodium complex, [Cp*Rh(&#956;3&#8208;Se){BH2(C5H4NSe)}2], 5 comprising a bicyclo [4.4.0] cage.

A supramolecular protecting group (sPG) enables selective esterification of monocarboxylic acids in the presence of dicarboxylic acids. A systems chemistry model was used to identify key parameters that govern selectivity, yielding general design principles for sPGs.








Abstract
A supramolecular protecting group (sPG) was developed that can selectively protect dicarboxylic acids, enabling the preferential esterification of monocarboxylic acids. The high selectivity (selectivity factor s&#160;=&#160;72) was achieved through reversible hydrogen bonding and measured under synthetically relevant conditions. This strategy offers an efficient and dynamic alternative to traditional covalent protecting groups. To deepen understanding and optimize the performance of the supramolecular approach, a systems chemistry model was developed, which was validated by the good agreement with experimental results. The computational model was then used to explore parameter space and define selectivity&#8208;limiting factors. The insights gained from the model guided the optimization of reaction conditions and provided general principles for using supramolecular protecting groups (sPGs). This strategy is expected to have broad implications for the development of new synthetic tools for efficient and selective organic chemical transformations in the selective functionalization of complex molecules.

         <title>The Impact of X&#8208;ray Damage in Chemical Crystalline Materials and New Opportunities for Small Molecule Serial Crystallography</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of X&#8208;ray damage in chemical crystals was minimised by the introduction of area detectors in the late 20th&#8208;century. Now, ever&#8208;brighter X&#8208;ray sources are re&#8208;establishing X&#8208;ray damage as a key challenge. This article reviews recent observations of X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced processes in chemical samples and discusses state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methodologies for their mitigation.








Abstract
In line with the dramatic and continuing improvements in X&#8208;ray generation technologies for laboratory and accelerator sources around the world, reports of X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced processes in chemical crystalline materials are on the rise. These observations are challenging the traditional viewpoint that radiation damage is only of significant concern for protein structure determinations, encouraging small molecule crystallographers to identify and address X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced effects in a broadening range of susceptible materials. This review explores the recent investigations into X&#8208;ray damage and X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced transformations in chemical crystalline materials and discusses state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methodologies to quantify and mitigate the effects of the X&#8208;ray probe on single&#8208;crystal and microcrystalline powder samples.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Novel Glycerol&#8208;Derived Liquids with Dual Functional Groups: Nonsymmetric (E/Z)&#8208;Isomeric Mixtures of 1,3&#8208;Diether&#8208;2&#8208;Alkenes</title>

         <dc:description>
Nonsymmetric (E/Z) isomeric mixtures of 1,3&#8208;diether&#8208;2&#8208;alkene molecules based on a glycerol skeleton were synthesized via elimination reaction of precursors with varied R groups. The resulting products were thoroughly characterized using both experimental and computational techniques. The C&#160;&#9552;&#160;C double bond was also shown to be reactive for thiol&#8208;ene chemistry, indicating that these molecules may also have use as chemical intermediates. These alkenes expand the portfolio of products and reactions that utilize the advantageous versatility of glycerol and related products.








Abstract
This study introduces the synthesis and detailed characterization of six novel nonsymmetric (E/Z)&#8208;isomeric mixtures of 1,3&#8208;diether&#8208;2&#8208;alkenes derived from precursors with a glycerol skeleton: 1&#8208;((3&#8208;butoxyallyl)oxy)heptane ([H, A, B]), 1&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)&#8208;5&#8208;methylhex&#8208;2&#8208;ene ([ME, A, IP]), 1&#8208;((3&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)prop&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxy)butane ([ME, A, B]), ((3&#8208;isopropoxyprop&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxy)benzene ([IP, A, Ph]), ((3&#8208;(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethoxy)prop&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxy)benzene ([F, A, Ph]), and 1&#8208;(allyloxy)&#8208;3&#8208;(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethoxy)prop&#8208;1&#8208;ene ([F, A, A]). These compounds were synthesized via a three&#8208;step reaction starting from various glycidyl ethers, purified by fractional distillation and drying, and obtained with overall isolated yields of at least 60%. The ratio of isomer configurations (E:E:Z:Z) varied based on substituents R1 and R2. Thermophysical properties, including density, refractive index (RI), and viscosity, were evaluated at temperatures of 293.15 to 333.15 and 353.15&#160;K. CO2 absorption capacity (Henry's constants) of compound [F, A, A] was assessed at temperatures of 303.15, 318.15, 333.15, and 348.15&#160;K under CO2 pressures from 2 to 10 atm. Density, viscosity, vapor pressure, enthalpy of vaporization, and dipole moment were also calculated for each compound. Moreover, the nonsymmetric alkenes&#8217; C&#160;&#9552;&#160;C double bond was shown to readily react with thiols via thiol&#8208;ene coupling. The resulting thioether linkage exhibits high stability under physiological conditions, making these compounds promising intermediates for synthesizing more complex glycerol&#8208;based molecules.

         <dc:description>
Program catalysis with light: Herein, we report a light&#8208;responsive peptide assembly system which switches between thermodynamically stable equilibrium nanofibers and energy&#8208;dependent nonequilibrium nanoparticles via SPs photoisomerization, enabling programmable control of catalytic activity in Michael addition reactions.








Abstract
The dynamic regulation of self&#8208;assembled structures in nonequilibrium states is critical for mimicking biological functions, where energy&#8208;driven processes underpin spatiotemporal control of molecular activities. Herein, we report a light&#8208;responsive peptide assembly system that switches between thermodynamically stable equilibrium nanofibers and energy&#8208;dependent nonequilibrium nanoparticles. This dual&#8208;state behavior is enabled by spiropyran's (SPs) photoisomerization, which switches between the closed&#8208;ring SP and open&#8208;ring merocyanine (MC) forms. Crucially, this morphological transition enables programmable control of catalytic activity in Michael addition reactions. In the dark&#8208;stable equilibrium state, the nanofiber formed by peptide 1 exhibited robust catalysis, achieving over 95% yield. Under blue light, the nonequilibrium nanoparticle assembly of 1 completely abolished catalytic activity. Intermittent light exposure further demonstrates programmable regulation of reaction progression.&#160;The system's ability to couple structural dynamics with functional modulation offers a new avenue for designing programmable catalysts and adaptive materials.

         <title>Tetrahydropyranyl Backbone Protection for Enhanced Fmoc Solid&#8208;Phase Peptide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Fmoc solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis has been indispensable for the efficient manufacture of research grade peptides and proteins, and peptide APIs. However, the solid&#8208;phase approach is still hampered by solubility issues and aggregation of the resin&#8208;bound peptide chain, which limits routine access to peptides&#160;&gt;&#160;40 amino acids in length. The use of backbone amide protecting groups, such as through the introduction of N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;based moieties and pseudoproline dipeptides, ameliorates this synthetic inefficiency somewhat. But benzyl groups can be difficult to remove postassembly, and pseudoprolines are limited to serine, threonine, and cysteine&#8208;rich peptide segments. To enhance the utility of backbone protection, we have evaluated the tetrahydropyranyl (Thp) group as a more acid labile alternative to benzyl protection. The Thp group can be efficiently introduced to the resin&#8208;bound peptide as a protected dipeptide and is readily cleaved and scavenged postsynthesis. A drastic improvement in the solid&#8208;phase assembly of aggregation&#8208;prone amyloid&#8208;&#946; and prion&#8208;derived peptide fragments is observed using Thp as a backbone protecting group. We envisage that Thp&#8208;protected dipeptides will become useful building blocks for peptide manufacturing, complementing existing backbone protecting group strategies.

         <title>5d Orbital Covalency Controls the High&#8208;Pressure Polymorphism of BaO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The influence of metal d orbitals on the high&#8208;pressure structures of CaO, SrO, and BaO are investigated with DFT calculations and chemical bonding analysis. CaO and SrO undergo the B1&#8208;B2 transition, from the rock salt structure to the caesium chloride structure, while BaO undergoes a sequence of transitions from B1&#8208;B8, the NiAs structure, and then B8&#8722; dB2, a distorted form of B2. DFT calculations of bond strengths show that the B8 and dB2 structures are stabilized relative to B1 and B2 by metal&#8208;oxygen covalency through the metal d orbitals. In BaO covalency outweighs electrostatics because of the large 5d orbitals of Ba, so the unique B8 and dB2 structures form. This marks an important expansion of the importance of d orbitals in group II chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Properties of an Aryloxenium Cation with a Triplet Electronic Ground State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryloxenium cations contain a formally positively&#8208;charged, monovalent oxygen atom with an incomplete electron shell. In spite of this unusual structural element, they are key intermediates in many important processes, such as biological oxidation reactions and the industrial generation of thermoplastics. However, the development of new applications is hindered by the lack of knowledge on their fundamental chemical properties. While most past studies have focused on aryloxenium cations with singlet electronic ground states, minor structural modifications can produce aryloxenium cations that have a triplet ground state. Unfortunately, examination of the reactivity of triplet aryloxenium cations is limited to just two studies that reported the detection of H atom abstraction from solvents. A detailed kinetic reactivity study involving cyclohexane, allyl iodide and dimethyl disulfide reagents is reported here for an aryloxenium cation with a triplet electronic ground state, the 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyloxenium cation.</dc:description>
