         <title>Electronic Buffering Mechanism Enhances Stability and Water Oxidation Efficiency of CeO2@NiFe&#8208;LDH</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nickel&#8208;iron layered double hydroxide shows significant promise as an electrocatalyst in facilitating oxygen evolution reactions. But its development is hindered by low conductivity and insufficient cycling stability. Herein, the synthesis of a hierarchically structured heterostructure catalyst, CeO2@NiFe LDH, is reported through a straightforward two&#8208;step process involving hydrothermal treatment. The catalyst realizes a significant breakthrough in OER catalytic performance and stability. At a current density of 100 mA cm&#8208;2, the overpotentials amount to 255 mV in 1 M KOH, 263 mV in simulated seawater with alkaline conditions, and 346 mV in actual alkaline seawater. After 200 hours of continuous operation under high current density in simulated alkaline seawater, the morphology with no significant alterations observed, highlighting its high stability in complex seawater environments. Introducing CeO2 optimizes the binding energy of the OH intermediate, which facilitates the formation and dissociation of the OOH intermediate. In situ Raman analysis demonstrates the positive impact of CeO2 on the generation of active species. This research emphasizes the efficacy of CeO2 in improving the performance and durability of NiFe LDH for oxygen evolution reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>De Novo Design of Lipopeptide&#8208;Based &#946;&#8208;Sheet&#8208;Like Self&#8208;Assemblies: A Strategy to Develop Fusion Inhibitors as Broad&#8208;Spectrum Antivirals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recent surge in emerging viral infections warrants the design of broad&#8208;spectrum antivirals. We aim to develop a lead molecule that targets a common biochemical feature of many enveloped viruses, membrane fusion. To achieve the broad&#8208;spectrum ability, instead of targeting the fusion machinery, we plan to modulate the physicochemical properties of the host and viral membranes to block fusion. The approach is based on the Coronin&#8208;1 protein of Mycobacterium, which presumably inhibits the phagosome&#8208;lysosome fusion, and a unique Trp&#8208;Asp (WD) sequence is placed at the distorted &#946;&#8208;meander motif. We designed a WD&#8208;based branched lipopeptide (Myr&#8208;D(WD)2) that supported the intermolecular interactions to create a &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like supramolecular assembly at the membrane surface. TEM and confocal fluorescence experiments also suggest that the lipopeptide self&#8208;assembled at the bilayer interface and modulated the interfacial order and the water penetration. We demonstrated that the supramolecular organization of Myr&#8208;D(WD)2 could block artificial membrane fusion completely and restrict pH&#8208;dependent H1N1, H9N2, and pH&#8208;independent mouse hepatitis virus, human coronavirus (HCoV&#8208;OC43) infections. The present study provided an evidence&#8208;based broad&#8208;spectrum antiviral potential of a designed self&#8208;assembled lipopeptide.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemiluminescence immunoassay of cTnI with ruthenium&#8208;based metal covalent organic framework and dual DNAzymes cascade amplification strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with tunability and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high stability are promising nanomaterials for electrochemiluminescence (ECL), while Ru&#8208;based metal covalent organic frameworks (Ru&#8208;MCOFs) have rarely been reported. Herein, an ECL immunosensor based on a strong ECL&#8208;emitting Ru&#8208;MCOF was proposed for the sensitive detection of the cardiac troponin&#8208;I (cTnI). Imine&#8208;linked Ru&#8208;MCOF was prepared as an ECL emitter via solvothermal method using tris(4,4' &#8208;diamino&#8208;2,2' &#8208;bipyridine)ruthenium(II) (Ru(dbpy)32+) as a precursor. Compared with monomers, the imine&#8208;linked Ru&#8208;MCOF achieved structural extension through covalent bonds, which not only effectively facilitated the electrochemical activation of the luminophores but also shortened the transmission distance between electrons and co&#8208;reactants, generating dense ECL emission. In addition, the porous framework of Ru&#8208;MCOF provided a microreactor with nanoconfinement effect, which could accelerate the diffusion of co&#8208;reactants into the framework and promote the excitation of internal and external ECL emitters, significantly enhancing the ECL intensity. Considering the excellent ECL performance of Ru&#8208;MCOF, combined with dual DNAzymes&#8208;driven catalytic hairpin cycle amplification, the ECL immunosensor achieved sensitive detection of cTnI with a detection limit as low as 0.42 fg/mL. The proposed highly stable Ru&#8208;MCOF raises a new approach for exploring MCOF&#8208;based luminophores, highlighting the potential of MCOFs in advancing ECL emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Gels Derived from Primary Ammonium Salts of Naproxen and its Amino Acid Derivatives: Design, Synthesis, Structures and its Application as Anti&#8208;cancer Agent Against Melanoma Cell B16&#8208;F10</title>

A series of PAM salts is rationally designed following supramolecular synthon approach that showed excellent gelation ability as well as self&#8208;healing, load&#8208;bearing and anti&#8208;cancer activities.







Abstract
Supramolecular synthon approach was employed to synthesize a series of primary ammonium monocarboxylate (PAM) salts derived from a well&#8208;known nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug (NSAID) naproxen (NAP) and its amino acid conjugates namely naproxen&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine (NAP&#8208;PHE) and naproxen&#8208;L&#8208;alanine (NAP&#8208;ALA), and four amines namely tyramine (TYRM), tryptamine (TRPM), 3,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenethylamine (DMP) and phenethylamine (PEA) as potential supramolecular gelators for developing self&#8208;drug delivery system. Out of the total twelve PAM salts thus synthesized, 75&#8201;% of the salts showed gelation ability. Importantly, majority of the gelator salts (67&#8201;%) displayed gelling abilities with topical gel formulating solvent methyl salicylate. One such salt, NAP&#8208;PHE&#8901;PEA was an ambidextrous gelator producing hydrogel with pure water and organogel with methyl salicylate with a minimum gelator concentration (MGC) of 0.5&#8197;wt % (w/v) thereby qualifying as a supergelator. The gels were extensively characterized by dynamic rheology and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Supramolecular interactions such as &#960;&#8208;&#960; and C&#8722;H&#8230;&#960; were probed by variable&#8208;temperature 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy in the hydrogelation process of NAP&#8208;PHE&#8901;PEA. Single crystal structures of nine out of twelve salts were determined and the supramolecular synthon present therein was carefully analyzed. Intriguing insights of the gel&#8208;network structure was also investigated by structure&#8208;property correlation based on single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (SXRD, PXRD, respectively) analysis of gelator/nongelator salts. The gelator salt NAP&#8208;PHE&#8901;PEA displayed significant anti&#8208;cancer property against cancer cells (B16&#8208;F10, HeLa and A375); it was found non&#8208;cytotoxic against normal cell lines (E. derm and HEK&#8208;293) at comparable concentrations as revealed by MTT assays. The gelator salt NAP&#8208;PHE&#8901;PEA also displayed significant anti&#8208;cancer behaviour against B16&#8208;F10 (scratch assay) and HeLa (multi&#8208;cellular tumour spheroid). The methyl salicylate gel of NAP&#8208;PHE&#8901;PEA displayed shape&#8208;sustaining, load&#8208;bearing, self&#8208;healing properties along with rheoreversibility, which are considered important for topical applications.

Photogeneration and direct observation of a 2H&#8208;phosphirene and an arylphosphenium ion.







Abstract
Phosphenium ions are highly reactive species with the formula of RR&#8216;P+. Although phosphenium ions were proposed as the invaluable intermediates of various important chemical processes, the methods to generate and characterize them were very limited. In this study, a novel photoprecursor to give rise to the arylphosphenium ions, 1&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phosphirane, was synthesized and investigated by femtosecond to nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopies, photoproduct analysis, and density functional theory calculations. Subsequent to photoexcitation, the S1 state of the photoprecursor of interest is populated from the higher excited states, accompanied by the generation of an unexpected 2H&#8208;phosphirene, 7bH&#8208;naphtho[1,2&#8208;b]phosphirene. After that, the resulted 2H&#8208;phosphirene is protonated by H2O in the solvent to generate the naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl(hydryl)phosphenium ion, which can be attacked by H2O and oxidized by O2 to give naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ylphosphinic acid as the major final product. The presence of these transient species is supported by density functional theory calculation and control experiments with different solvents. This study provides an understanding of the reactivity of arylphosphenium ions as well as 2H&#8208;phosphirenes, and provides a novel method to generate and characterize these reactive species, which may help to further reveal their reactivity and explore their chemistry and use in a range of applications.

&lt;p&gt;Photogeneration and direct observation of a 2H-phosphirene and an arylphosphenium ion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosphenium ions are highly reactive species with the formula of RR&#8216;P&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Although phosphenium ions were proposed as the invaluable intermediates of various important chemical processes, the methods to generate and characterize them were very limited. In this study, a novel photoprecursor to give rise to the arylphosphenium ions, 1-(naphthalen-2-yl)phosphirane, was synthesized and investigated by femtosecond to nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopies, photoproduct analysis, and density functional theory calculations. Subsequent to photoexcitation, the S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; state of the photoprecursor of interest is populated from the higher excited states, accompanied by the generation of an unexpected 2H-phosphirene, 7bH-naphtho[1,2-b]phosphirene. After that, the resulted 2H-phosphirene is protonated by H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in the solvent to generate the naphthalen-2-yl(hydryl)phosphenium ion, which can be attacked by H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and oxidized by O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to give naphthalen-2-ylphosphinic acid as the major final product. The presence of these transient species is supported by density functional theory calculation and control experiments with different solvents. This study provides an understanding of the reactivity of arylphosphenium ions as well as 2H-phosphirenes, and provides a novel method to generate and characterize these reactive species, which may help to further reveal their reactivity and explore their chemistry and use in a range of applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry Unveils Nsp10 Inhibitors with Antiviral Potential Against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates antiviral strategies targeting SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 by disrupting the protein&#8208;protein interactions of Nsp10 with Nsp14 and Nsp16, which are essential for viral survival. It employs target&#8208;directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry for the identification and synthesis of inhibitors. Evaluation of these inhibitors for their binding affinity, enzymatic&#8208;activity inhibition, and antiviral effects, offers novel insights for developing therapeutics against coronaviruses.







Abstract
The development of antiviral drugs against the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) responsible for the recent Covid&#8208;19 pandemic is crucial, as treatment options remain limited and vaccination does not prevent (re)infection. Two relatively underexplored targets of this virus are the 3&#8242;&#8208;5&#8242; exoribonuclease (ExoN) and the 2&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;methyltransferase (2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;MTase), both essential for viral viability. The non&#8208;structural proteins Nsp14 and Nsp16 exhibit enzymatic activities for ExoN and 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;MTase, respectively, especially when in complex with their co&#8208;factor protein Nsp10. The study focuses on the use of target&#8208;directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry (tdDCC) to identify binders of Nsp10, aiming to disturb the protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPI) involving Nsp10&#8208;Nsp14, as well as Nsp10&#8208;Nsp16. We synthesised the hits and evaluated them to assess Nsp10 affinity, ExoN and 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;MTase activities inhibition, and antiviral activity in hCoV&#8208;229E and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;infected whole&#8208;cell settings. This study reports a novel class of ExoN and/or 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;MTase inhibitors exhibiting antiviral activity against coronaviruses.

         <title>B(C6F5)3&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Thioetherifications of Alkenes via Thiiranium Intermediates: Experimental and Computational Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates a substitution&#8208;controlled regiodivergent thioetherification of di&#8208; and trisubstituted alkenes, using 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% B(C6F5)3 as a metal&#8208;free catalyst and N&#8208;thiosuccinimide as a sulfenylating agent. The method provides efficient Csp2&#8722;H and Csp3&#8722;S sulfenylation products with high yields, along with diphenylvinylsulfides with AIE properties used for OLEDs, sensors, and imaging, and allylic thioethers. DFT analysis reveals a thiiranium&#8208;ion&#8208;mediated mechanism.







Abstract
Precise control of selective alkene functionalization is a continuing challenge in the chemical community. In this study, we develop a substitution&#8208;controlled regiodivergent thioetherification of di&#8208; or trisubstituted alkenes using 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3] as a catalyst and N&#8208;thiosuccinimide as a sulfenylating reagent. This metal&#8208;free borane catalyzed C&#8722;S bond forming method is utilized for a Csp2&#8722;H sulfenylation reaction to synthesize an array of diphenylvinylsulfide derivatives with good to excellent yields (25 examples, up to 91&#8201;% yield). Some of the products exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen properties used in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), chemical sensors, and biological imaging units. Depending upon the starting alkene, Csp3&#8722;S sulfenylation products could also be generated regioselectively. A variety of allylic thioethers from &#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted styrenes were isolable in good yields and selectivities (14 examples, up to 67&#8201;% yield). The DFT&#8208;supported mechanistic study confirms that the reaction proceeds via a thiiranium ion intermediate, where the regioselectivity and product formation is determined by the alkene substituents which influence the activation barriers and energy profiles. Diphenylvinylsulfide derivatives can also be efficiently transformed into a range of synthetically valuable compounds, including vinyl sulfoxides, vinyl sulfones, and vinyl sulfoximines.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>he overuse of fossil fuels and various anthropogenic activities have resulted in excessive carbon dioxide emissions, causing significant global warming. Measures to reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations are critically needed to address this pressing global challenge. Consequently, exploring environmentally friendly strategies for capturing airborne CO2 and converting it into high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals presents a promising pathway towards achieving "carbon neutrality". In recent years, porous organic polymers (POPs) have garnered significant attention for CO2 capture and catalytic conversion due to their high specific surface area, excellent chemical stability, nanoscale porosity, and structural versatility, which facilitate functionalization. This review discusses the preparation methods of various POPs, the types of POPs utilized for CO2 adsorption, and recent advancements in using POPs for photocatalytic and chemocatalytic CO2 conversion. Additionally, we examine the impact of different adsorption mechanisms on the efficiency of catalytic conversion. Finally, we propose future directions for advancing research in this dynamic field.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Functional Sulfur&#8208;rich Copolymers for Stable Anchoring and Enhanced Conversion of Polysulfide in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur&#8208;rich copolymers have gained a great deal of attention as promising cathode materials in Li&#8208;S batteries due to their low cost and naturally uniform sulfur dispersion. However, the poor electrical conductivity and shuttle effect cause rapid capacity decay and low sulfur utilization especially under high sulfur loading and low electrolyte/sulfur ratio. Herein, the Fe1&#8208;xS/C dispersed and Se&#8208;containing sulfur&#8208;rich polymer (FSP) was synthesized by one&#8208;pot reaction of ferrocene, trithioiynuric acid with SexSy. In such process, the trithioiynuric acid reacts with SexSy to form Se&#8208;containing sulfur&#8208;rich copolymers. Simultaneously, ferrocene reacts with sulfur to form highly dispersed Fe1&#8208;xS/C within sulfur&#8208;rich copolymers. The covalent chemical binding of sulfur in the FSP e&#64256;ectively suppress the shuttle e&#64256;ect of polysul&#64257;des by chemical binding. Meanwhile, the Se improves the conductivity of FSP, which enhances the reaction kinetics. Moreover, the highly dispersed Fe1&#8208;xS/C in the FSP is able to effectively catalyze polysulfide conversion and inhibit the shuttle effect. As a result, the optimized FSP electrode exhibits a high capacity of 1330 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.2 C. Even under high sulfur loading (4.08 mg cm&#8208;2) and low E/S ratio (6 &#956;L mg&#8208;1), the FSP cathode demonstrates a remarkable capacity of 734.7 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.2 C.</dc:description>

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Platinum&#8208;Free High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Catalysts on Reduced Graphene Oxide Sheets for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction and Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nano&#8208;sized high&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs) recently received more attention to researchers due to their superior electrochemical catalytic properties. HEMs comprise at least five elements with or without metals and are synthesized through solid&#8208;state reactions and solution&#8208;mediated techniques. The presence of many elements in these HEMs result in a high mixing entropy and facilitates the formation of stable solid solutions in fundamental crystal structures. Herein, Pt&#8208;free high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) were synthesized through facile and straightforward pulse microwave (PM) synthesis technique, which serve as efficient electrochemical catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction. The PM synthesis method was conducted at an extremely low temperature (100 &#176;C) without any external catalytic reagents. Using this PM technique, Cr18.2Zr13.5Ti5.3Co17.8Ni8.4Cu8.5Fe28.3 and Al15.3Mn18.2Ti3.7Co23.2Ni5.9Cu5.9Fe27.8 HEAs catalysts were synthesized with superior catalytic activity towards OER and ORR and compare its activities with pure Pt catalysts. The as&#8208;prepared HEAs also display an anti&#8208;CO poisoning effect and long&#8208;term durability, as compared to pure Pt catalysts. The low&#8208;temperature PM approach not only confirms the feasibility of synthesis of noble metal&#8208;free HEAs but also validates their superior catalytic activity towards OER and ORR, which is beneficial for the development of proton exchange membrane fuel cells and proton exchange membrane water electrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced deprotection of 2&#8208;nitrophenylneopentyl glycol boronates enables light&#8208;triggered polycondensation of siloxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Various protecting groups have been developed for boronic acids, mostly based on diols. Alternatives include trifluoroborates and amine complexes, which offer easier synthesis and release under milder conditions. We present here a new strategy involving photocleavable protecting groups for boronic and borinic acids, based on the 2&#8208;nitrobenzyl motif. A screening of several 1,2&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;diols bearing a 2&#8208;nitrobenzyl group led us to identify 1&#8208;(2&#8208;nitrophenyl)neopentyl glycol (npnp) for the protection of boronic acid derivatives. This diol is easily prepared in a single step on gram scale, and the corresponding npnp boronates are stable in wet acetonitrile at 90 &#176;C for several days, and under under acidic conditions. Irradiation at 365 nm in acetonitrile allows for the controlled liberation of boronic acids in good to excellent yields, a method also applied to a dimesitylborinic ester bearing a 2&#8208;nitrobenzylalcohol moiety. 1&#8208;(2&#8208;Nitrophenyl)neopentyl glycol boronates ArB(npnp) demonstrated their utility in light&#8208;triggered siloxane crosslinking. We showed that catalysts incorporated into a polymer matrix, irradiated, and then incubated at 50 &#176;C for 7 days resulted in efficient polymerization, forming solid materials in some cases.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Pseudopeptides to Decipher the Interplay Between Cu and Methionine&#8208;Rich Domains in Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Maintaining tightly copper homeostasis is crucial for the survival of all living organisms, in particular microorganisms like bacteria. They have evolved a number of proteins to capture, transport and deliver Cu(I), while avoiding Fenton&#8208;like reactions. Some Cu proteins exhibit methionine&#8208;rich (Met&#8208;rich) domains, whose role remains elusive. In this work, we designed biomimetic compounds recapitulating the possible Cu(I) binding sites in these domains, in order to examine the parameters important for Cu(I) binding. Five different biomimetic pseudopeptides were synthesized, exhibiting either three methionines or two methionines and a third amino acid likely to be present in the Met&#8208;rich domain. The affinities for Cu(I) of these model binding sites were determined, as well as their redox properties and behavior in the presence of Cu(II). Our results highlight the importance of Met residues, and their abundance in Met&#8208;rich domains, to efficiently bind Cu(I) in the periplasmic space.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial synergism in NiMoO4/FeOOH heterostructure for enhanced alkaline oxygen evolution and urea oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>FeOOH with excellent catalytic properties for oxygen evolution and also considered to be a true active site has attracted great interest in recent years. However, the intrinsic low conductivity limits its catalytic performance. Herein, a one&#8208;dimensional core&#8208;shell NiMoO4/FeOOH heterojunction with high OER activity and stability was developed. At current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm&#8208;2, low overpotentials of 194 and 266 mV are need to drive oxygen evolution, meanwhile, the electrode exhibits high catalytic kinetics with small Tafel slopes of 53.4 mV dec&#8208;1 and excellent stability over 100 hours. Further analysis showed that the ultrathin FeOOH layer (~5 nm) uniformly covered the surface of NiMoO4 nanorods, acting as an active species and facilitating the surface change transfer to the interior. The internal NiMoO4 cores, on the other hand, provides reliable electron transmission as a highly conductive medium, and can effectively overcome the low conductivity of FeOOH. DFT calculations further manifest the strong electronic interactions between NiMoO4 and FeOOH species. The NiMoO4 core serves as mass transport of active materials is beneficial to tune the adsorption energy of OH&#8208; on the surface of electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This experimental and theoretical study illustrates how phosphaalkenes, which are isolobal to alkenes, can utilize a variety of external triggers for molecular switching. The E/Z isomerization of a truxene&#8208;based phosphaalkene, i.e. TruxC=P&#8208;Mes* (Mes* = 2,4,6&#8208;tris&#8208;t&#8208;butyl&#8208;benzene), is accomplished by irradiation, metal coordination, or deprotonation of the truxene core. The reversible and quantitative Z/E double bond isomerization by gold(I) coordination/decoordination of the phosphorous lone pair represents a novel fuelling strategy for molecular switches.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from oxygen (O2) represents a promising catalytic pathway, the limited efficiency of the oxygen reduction constitutes a primary barrier to enhancing production. In this content, alkali metal potassium (K+) and Br&#8208;doped g&#8208;C3N4 photocatalysts (K&#8208;CN) were successfully constructed by one&#8208;pot method. The introduction of K+ is not only beneficial to the transmission of space charge and the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers, but also promotes the efficient production of H2O2 by 2e&#8208; oxygen reduction reaction. The introduction of Br&#8208; promotes O2 converted to triplet state and triggers energy transfer process to increase 1O2 production, O2 adsorption was facilitated through regulating the oxygen evolution (O2&#8594;1O2), which is beneficial to the subsequent oxygen reduction process. The results showed that the H2O2 yield of 0.05 K&#8208;CN catalyst reached 26.0 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, which was more than 5 times that of pure g&#8208;C3N4.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Potential of Thiophene&#8208;Functionalized Porous Organic Polymers for Bromine Adsorption and Selective Separation from Iodine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bromine is a significant environmental threat due to its corrosive nature and contribution to ozone layer depletion. It often coexists with iodine and forms interhalogen complexes (IBr), which require an effective and selective bromine adsorption strategy. Leveraging the electrophilic nature of bromine, we designed an electron&#8208;rich thiophene&#8208;based porous organic polymer (POF&#8208;2). This material exhibits exceptional efficiency for bromine adsorption (2.86 g g&#8722;1) and rapid uptake kinetic from aqueous solutions, driven by noncovalent charge transfer interactions. POF&#8208;2 also demonstrates selective capture of bromine from a bromine&#8208;iodine mixture in cyclohexane. The material's electron&#8208;rich sites exhibit a stronger orbital interaction with the &#963;* orbital of bromine compared to iodine, leading to the observed selectivity in cyclohexane.</dc:description>

         <title>Sheets Copper&#8208;Cobalt Graphitic Carbon Nitride Dual Single&#8208;Atom&#160;Catalysts for the Epoxidation of Styrene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#160;single&#8208;atom catalysts have attracted considerable research interest due to their higher metal atom loading and more flexible active sites compared to single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs).&#160;We pioneered the one&#8208;step synthesis of sheets copper&#8208;cobalt graphitic carbon nitride dual single&#8208;atom (S&#8208;Cu/Co&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4) using folding fan&#8208;shaped aluminum foil as a template, and used them as catalysts in the epoxidation of styrene respectively. Through XAFS&#65288;X&#8208;ray Absorption Fine Structure&#65289; and&#160;other characterizations, it is found that Cu and Co&#160;single atoms are stabilized separately on g&#8208;C3N4&#160;via coordination with nitrogen (N), hindered the ordered growth of sheets, and formed more pore structures, which not only increased more catalytically active sites, but also effectively prevented the flakes re&#8208;aggregate during the catalytic process. And the synergistic effect between Cu and Co changes the energy band structure of the material and facilitates electron transfer during catalysis, hence an excellent catalytic effect of 89% styrene conversion and 85% styrene oxide selectivity was achieved when S&#8208;Cu/Co&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;1:1 was applied in the epoxidation of styrene. Furthermore, the mechanisms&#160;of the epoxidation of styrene with S&#8208;Cu/Co&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;1:1&#160;was&#160;probed by the density functional theory (DFT) based on the&#160;slab model.</dc:description>

         <title>Water Microdroplets Promote Spontaneous Oxidation of Amino Acid&#8208; and Peptide&#8208;related Thiols to Disulfide Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Disulfide bonds (S&#8722;S) play a critical role in modern biochemistry, organic synthesis and prebiotic chemistry. Traditional methods for synthesizing disulfide bonds often rely on oxygen, alkali, &#160;and metal catalysts. Herein, thiol groups involved in amino acids and peptides were spontaneously converted into symmetrical and unsymmetrical disulfide bonds within water microdroplets, without the need for catalysts or oxygen, and under room temperature. Water microdroplets displayed improved selectivity for disulfide bond formation, with minimal production of other oxidative species. Mechanistic investigations revealed that hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) present on the water microdroplet surface facilitated the oxidation process. Thiols were firstly oxidized to thiyl radicals (RS&#8226;), which subsequently coupled to form disulfide bonds. This study highlights the potential of microdroplet chemistry as an efficient and mild approach for constructing disulfide bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>PDA/PMMA blend membrane utilized for the selective adsorption and separation of heavy metal ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The detrimental effects of heavy metal aqueous pollution are attracting people's attention increasingly. Membrane separation technology plays a pivotal role in the treatment of aqueous pollution due to its low energy consumption and excellent separation effect. Inspired by the strong adhesion of heavy metal ions by the dopamine in mussel protein, we have fabricated the 5%, 10%, 20% and 30% proportion of polydopamine (PDA)/Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) blend membranes with dopamine structure by solvent&#8208;induced phase conversion. I&#8208;V current, UV titration and transmission tests examined the membrane's selective adsorption and retention capabilities for Fe3+, Cu2+ and Cr3+. These experiments indicated the different selectivity for Fe3+ of four blend membranes with varying PDA/PMMA fractions. Based on Langmuir's adsorption theory, the 10% blend membranes exhibited the most outstanding selective adsorption for Fe3+ with an LOD of 4.724&#215;10&#8208;9 M. Moreover, the ability to retain Fe3+ is still close to 100% after 48 h of transmission.

Membrane separation technology plays a pivotal role in the treatment of aqueous pollution due to its low energy consumption and excellent separation effect. Inspired by the strong adhesion of heavy metal ions by the dopamine in mussel protein, we have fabricated the 5%, 10%, 20% and 30% proportion of polydopamine (PDA)/Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) blend membranes with dopamine structure by solvent-induced phase conversion. I-V current, UV titration and transmission tests examined the membrane's selective adsorption and retention capabilities for Fe3+, Cu2+ and Cr3+. These experiments indicated the different selectivity for Fe3+ of four blend membranes with varying PDA/PMMA fractions. Based on Langmuir's adsorption theory, the 10% blend membranes exhibited the most outstanding selective adsorption for Fe3+ with an LOD of 4.724&#215;10-9 M. Moreover, the ability to retain Fe3+ is still close to 100% after 48 h of transmission. This study manifested that the PDA/PMMA blend membrane is capable of adsorbing trace amounts of Fe3+ from water, thereby contributing to aqueous purification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Shape&#8208;Memory and Durable Transparent Polyacrylate Film Integrated by Soft&#8208;Rigid Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible film in display requires multi&#8208;functional integration, such as stretchability, flexibility, abrasion resistance, transparency, and shape memory. In this paper,&#160;a reasonable design strategy of flexible polyacrylate&#160;(PA) film&#160;with high transparency,&#160;shape&#160;memory,&#160;excellent&#160;abrasion&#160;resistance&#160;and foldability&#160;is presented. The PA films are prepared by free radical polymerization of&#160;vinyl&#8208;terminated&#160;polyurethane (PU) prepolymer as a cross&#8208;linking agent and acrylate monomers in&#160;ultraviolet&#160;(UV) light. The&#160;various acrylate monomers in PA films with different functional groups (e.g. epoxy groups, benzene rings) provide&#160;soft&#8208;rigid chains and&#160;hydrogen bonds, which improve overall mechanical&#160;and optical properties.&#160;The experimental results also effectively demonstrate that after&#160;folding performance (500 cycles)&#160;or&#160;abrasion&#160;resistance (1000 cycles), the transparency&#160;of PA film&#160;remained&#160;above 91%.&#160;In addition, the PA films&#160;with different folded shapes also prove excellent shape&#160;memory, which can fix the folded shape at low temperature and then return to the original shape at room temperature.&#160;Notably, the PA film is successfully applied to the curved touch screen through drawing, pattern decoding and image magnification in the simulation practical demonstration, fully revealing its great significance as a flexible substrate in the development of future flexible displays.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepwise Modulation of Bridged Single&#8208;Benzene&#8208;Based Fluorophores for Materials Science</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, researchers studying fluorogenic samples have steadily shifted from using large, expensive, poorly soluble fluorophores with complex synthetic sequences to smaller, simpler p scaffolds with low molecular weight. This research article presents an in&#8208;depth study of the photophysical properties of five bridged single&#8208;benzene&#8208;based fluorophores (SBBFs) investigated for their solution and solid&#8208;state emission (SSSE) properties. The compounds O4, N1O3, N2O2, N3O1, and N4 are derived from a central terephthalonitrile core and vary in the amount of oxygen and nitrogen bridging atoms. These minimalized emitters show full&#8208;color tunable emission properties and exhibit moderate&#8208;to&#8208;high photoluminescence quantum yield values reaching up to 0.78 in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). In addition to demonstrating excellent compatibility in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films and additive manufacturing using stereolithography (SLA), white light emission was achieved in both solution and 3D&#8208;printed materials by controlling the mixing ratio of the compounds. Employing density&#8208;functional theory (DFT), well&#8208;correlating theoretical absorption and emission wavelengths were calculated as average values of the different possible conformers. Furthermore, cellular internalization of the substances was accomplished using Pluronic&#174; F&#8208;127 nanoparticles. Overall, this study emphasizes the remarkable properties of single&#8208;benzene&#8208;based emitters, showcasing their accessibility and potential applications in biomedical fields and materials science.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Multicentric DIL@PDIL Catalyst for Mild CO 2 &#160;Conversion to Cyclic Carbonates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among the various studies on CO2&#160;utilization, the sustainable and cost&#8208;effective fixation of CO2&#160;into cyclic carbonates remains one of the most intriguing subjects. To this end, a novel type of &#160;composite&#160;dicationic ionic liquid&#160;material, DIL@PDIL,&#160;was developed. This composite consists of a dicationic ionic liquid (DIL), DMAP[TMGH]Br, supported on a polymeric dicationic ionic liquid (PDIL), P&#8208;DVB/Im[TMGH]Br. The multicentric high&#8208;ion&#8208;density material was prepared with exceptional efficiency from five readily available starting materials in one pot through simultaneous quaternization, neutralization and polymerization.&#160;The structure was characterized using FT&#8208;IR, XPS, SEM, TGA, ICP&#8208;MS and BET, as well as through stepwise synthesis verification. Evaluation of the catalytic performance revealed the ionic liquid composite delivered chloropropylene carbonate (CPC) in excellent yield and selectivity from either pure CO2&#160;or simulated flue gas at 60 oC and relatively lower pressure. Additionally, the DIL@PDIL catalyst exhibited good recyclability and were applicable to a range of epoxide substrates. The high activity of the the catalyst could be attributed to the abundant [TMGH]+&#160;hydrogen bonding donors&#160;and Br&#8208;&#160;anions, which synergistically catalyze the epoxide ring&#8208;opening, as well as the abundant &#8208;COO&#8208;&#160;groups and imidazole cations, which facilitate the adsorption and activation of CO2.</dc:description>

         <title>Graphene oxide as a self&#8208;carbocatalyst to facilitate the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of glycidol for efficient polyglycerol grafting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Grafting carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials (CNMs) with polyglycerol (PG) improves their application potentials in biomedicine and electronics. Although &#8220;grafting from&#8221; method offers advantages over &#8220;grafting to&#8221; one in terms of operability and versatility, little is known about the reaction process of glycidol with the surface groups onto CNMs. By using graphene oxide (GO) as a multi&#8208;functional model material, we examined the reactivity of the surface groups on GO toward glycidol molecules via a set of model reactions. We reveal that carboxyl groups spontaneously react with the epoxide ring with no need of catalyst, while GO catalyzes the reactions of hydroxyl groups with the epoxide of glycidol. In addition, the hydroxyl group of glycidol can open the epoxide in the basal pane of GO. The subsequent polymerization of PG is supposed to propagate at the primary and/or the secondary hydroxyl groups, generating a ramified PG macromolecule with random branch&#8208;on&#8208;branch topology. In addition, ketones, benzyl esters and aromatic ethers are found not to react with glycidol even in the presence of GO, while the aldehydes are easily oxidized into carboxyl groups under ambient condition, behaving then as the carboxyl groups. Our findings pose the foundation for understanding the polymerization mechanism of PG on CNMs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The development of multifunctional therapeutic agents is crucial for addressing complex diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we report a ruthenium&#8208;rhenium (Ru&#8208;Re) complex that combines photodynamic therapy (PDT) and carbon monoxide (CO) generation capabilities. The Ru&#8208;Re complex shows promising photophysical property and significant therapeutic potential. Our studies reveal the complex's ability to generate singlet oxygen (1O2), CO, inhibit tau aggregation, and enhance mitochondrial respiration. These multifunctional properties position the Ru&#8208;Re complex as a versatile tool for therapeutic applications in Alzheimer's disease.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Catalytic Potential of Bioinspired Taurine&#8208;Functionalized Carbon Quantum Dots as Bifunctional Catalysts for Diverse Sustainable Organic Transformations in Water.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Taurine&#8208;functionalized Carbon Quantum Dots (Tau&#8208;CQDs) were synthesized and evaluated for their catalytic potential under metal&#8208;, acid&#8208;, and base&#8208;free sustainable conditions, using water as a solvent for various organic transformations, including Knoevenagel condensation, the Biginelli reaction, and the Knoevenagel&#8208;Michael cascade. These bioinspired N, S&#8208;doped CQDs exhibit bifunctionality, acting as hydrogen bond donors and acceptors for C&#8211;C, C&#8211;N, and C&#8211;O bond formation. Comprehensive characterization of the catalyst was performed using HRTEM, PXRD, XPS, FTIR, AFM, Zeta potential, UV&#8208;Vis, and photoluminescence spectrometry. The Tau&#8208;CQDs demonstrated excellent reusability, maintaining catalytic performance over 10 cycles. Green chemistry metrics, including a low E&#8208;factor, high atom economy, and favorable PMI, CE, and RME values, highlight this approach's environmental and economic advantages. Key properties, such as high reaction yields, short reaction times, water solubility, enhanced surface functionality, non&#8208;toxicity, and mild operating conditions, underscore the broader significance of Tau&#8208;CQDs as an efficient, sustainable catalytic platform. Additionally, the simple recovery of the catalyst via filtration, without the need for further purification, enhances its practical applicability.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Modelling and Machine Learning Approaches on the Conductance Transients of Zn0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 Sensors for Addressing Cross&#8208;sensitivity towards Ethanol and Acetone Vapors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The accurate discrimination among various volatile organic compounds, especially ethanol and acetone possess a serious concern for metal oxide based chemiresistive sensors. The work presents a systematic approach to address the issue by utilizing superior sensing potentiality of Zn0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 coupled with efficient machine learning (ML) techniques. The work provides a thorough understanding on the synthesis, characterization of Zn0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 nanoparticles and evaluating their sensing performance towards ethanol and acetone vapors. The optimized sensor performance recorded under varying concentrations (100&#8208;1000 ppm) of analytes across the range of temperature (225&#8208;300 &#176;C) provides lesser selectivity between acetone and ethanol. The&#160;Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood&#160;reaction mechanism was invoked further to address the selectivity issue by modeling the response transients of the sensor to get an insight into sensing interaction at microscopic level. The estimated activation energy values of ethanol (0.26 eV) have been found to be smaller compared to that of acetone (0.34 eV), explaining little higher response of the sensor towards ethanol. Moreover, some efficient ML algorithms were employed to predictively analyze the acquired sensing data for achieving more precise discriminations between these two analytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Reductive Zincke Reaction: Opening of Pyridinium Rings to &#948;&#8208;Amino Ketones via Transfer Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Zincke reaction and Birch reduction have been one of the few reactions that allow for ring opening of pyridines ever since the discovery of pyridine more than a century ago. This paper presents a new addition to the list of pyridine ring&#8208;opening reactions, reductive Zincke reaction, which affords saturated &#948;&#8208;amino ketones. Under the catalysis of a simple rhodium complex, pyridinium salts with diverse substituents are reduced with formic acid, ring&#8208;opened with water, transaminated with a secondary amine and further reduced to afford a wide range of &#948;&#8208;amino ketones, including those in which the alkane chain of the ketones is selectively deuterated or fluorinated. The applicability of the reaction is exemplified by the synthesis of drug analogues and late&#8208;stage modification of drug molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving precise control over the molecular periphery of dibenzoixenes through modular synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanographenes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, both finite forms of graphene, are promising organic semiconducting materials because their optoelectronic and magnetic properties can be modulated through precise control of their molecular peripheries. Several atomically precise edge structures have been prepared by bottom&#8208;up synthesis; however, no systematic elucidation of these edge topologies at the molecular level has been reported. Herein, we describe rationally designed modular syntheses of isomeric dibenzoixenes with diverse molecular peripheries, including cove, zigzag, bay, fjord, and gulf structured. The single&#8208;crystal structures of dibenzo[a,p]ixene and dibenzo[j,y]ixene reveal enantiomeric pairs with helically twisted cove edges and packing structures. The molecular edge structures are identified from the C&#8211;H bonds of the dibenzoixenes using Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy with different vibrational modes, which were further explained using density functional theory calculations. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy indicate that the zigzag&#8208;edged molecular periphery significantly affects the magnetic properties of the material. Furthermore, the electrochemical characteristics, examined using dibenzoixenes as anode materials in Li&#8208;ion batteries, reveal that the dibenzo[a,p]ixene exhibits promising Li intercalation behaviors with a specific capacity of ~120 mAh g&#8211;1. The findings of this study could facilitate the synthesis of larger [[EQUATION]]&#8208;extended systems with engineered molecular peripheries and potential application in organic electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Mesostructured Yb3+, Er3+ Codoped CeO2 with Upconverted Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Upconverted circularly polarized luminescence (UC&#8208;CPL) active organic and organic&#8208;inorganic composite materials have garnered increasing attention due to their vast potential applications in areas such as 3D displays, encryptions, spintronics and optoelectronic devices. However, effective methods for fabricating chiral inorganic materials exhibiting UC&#8208;CPL remain a challenge. Herein, we propose an approach for the synthesis of UC&#8208;CPL active chiral mesostructured CeO2 powders (CMCs) via a hydrothermal growth method, using L/D&#8208;aspartic acid as symmetry&#8208;breaking and structure&#8208;directing agents. Two levels of chirality exist in CMCs: primary nanoplates constructed from nanoparticles and the helical stacking of these nanoplates to form a twisting nanofusiform. Yb3+ and Er3+ ions can be codoped into the CMCs through a one&#8208;step synthesis to achieve UC&#8208;CPL. The 1% Yb3+, 1% Er3+ codoped CMCs exhibited absorption&#8208;based optical activities in the range of 350&#8208;500 nm, similar to undoped CMCs, and displayed circularly polarized luminescence in the range of 520&#8208;610 nm under the excitation by a 980 nm laser. This luminescence is attributable to the energy transfer process between Yb3+ and Er3+. This work may provide new insights into designing chiral photon upconversion inorganic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemically Robust Cationic Porous Organic Polymer (POP) for Selective Detection and Removal of ReO4&#8208; as a Surrogate of Radioactive 99TcO4&#8208;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficient removal of 99TcO4&#8208; from alkaline nuclear waste is vital for optimizing nuclear waste management and safeguarding the environment. However, current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art sorbent materials are constrained by their inability to simultaneously achieve high alkali resistance, rapid adsorption kinetics, large adsorption capacity, and selectivity. In this study, we synthesized a urea&#8208;rich cationic porous organic polymer, IPM&#8208;403, which demonstrates exceptional chemical stability, ultrafast kinetics (~92% removal within 30 seconds), high adsorption capacity (664 mg/g), excellent selectivity, along with multiple&#8208;cycle recyclability (up to 7 cycles), making it highly promising for the removal of ReO4&#8208; (surrogate of 99TcO4&#8208;) from nuclear wastewater. Notably, after exposure to 1 M NaOH solution for 24 hours, IPM&#8208;403 maintained a high adsorption capacity of 421.3 mg/g for ReO4&#8208;. Furthermore, IPM&#8208;403 acts as an efficient sensor for ReO4&#8208;, exhibiting a turn&#8208;on response and a detection limit as low as 78.8 ppb.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Multiple Deuteration of Polyethylene Glycol Derivatives using Deuterium Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deuterated molecules are of growing interest because of the specific characteristics of deuterium, such as stronger C&#8208;D bonds being stronger than C&#8208;H bonds. Polyethylene glycols (PEGs) are widely utilized in scientific fields (e.g., drug discovery and material sciences) as linkers and for the improvement of various properties (solubility in water, stability, etc.) of mother compounds. Therefore, deuterated PEGs can be used as novel tools for drug discovery. Although the H/D exchange reaction (deuteration) is a powerful and straightforward method to produce deuterated compounds, the deuteration of PEGs bearing many unactivated C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds has not been developed. Herein, we report the photocatalytic deuteration of multiple sites of&#160;PEGs using tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium decatungstate (TBADT) and D2O as an inexpensive deuterium source. This deuteration can be adapted to PEG derivatives bearing various substituents ((hetero)aryl, benzoyl, alkyl, etc.). The deuteration efficiencies of the &#945;&#8208;oxy C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds at the terminal positions of the PEGs were strongly influenced by the substituents. These reactivities were elucidated by density functional theory calculations of the reaction barriers towards the formation of radical intermediates, induced by the excited state of TBADT and the PEG substrate. In addition, the applicability of deuterated PEGs to internal standard experiments and Raman spectroscopy was demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving Ultrabright NIR&#8208;II Nanofluorophore for In Vivo Imaging by Inhibiting H&#8208;Aggregates Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small molecules with an acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;D&#8208;A) structure, featuring a fused&#8208;ring core as the donor and two electron&#8208;withdrawing end groups as acceptor units, represent a potential option for NIR&#8208;II fluorophores, benefiting from their narrow bandgaps, superior light&#8208;harvesting capabilities, and exceptional photostabilities. However, their planar conformations predispose them to forming H&#8208;aggregates during self&#8208;assembly, leading to significantly reduced fluorescence quantum yield (QY) of the resulting nanofluorophores. Herein, we report a small molecule, PF8CN, with a terminal unit&#8208;A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;terminal unit structure. The terminal units of 3,5&#8208;bis(octyloxy)phenyl group result in a twisted conformation for PF8CN, preventing face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking and thereby inhibiting the formation of H&#8208;aggregates. Consequently, the NIR&#8208;II fluorescence QY of PF8CN NPs is 3.8 times that of the model nanofluorophore (F8CN NPs), which contains a substantial amount of H&#8208;aggregates. The NIR&#8208;II brightness of PF8CN NPs is 5.3&#8208; and 14.9&#8208;times that of F8CN NPs and ICG/FBS, respectively, at an equal molar concentration. Such ultrahigh NIR&#8208;II brightness of PF8CN NPs allows us to perform long&#8208;term and real&#8208;time NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging of cerebral and hindlimb vessels, as well as the thrombolytic process. This work provides an effective method for producing nanofluorophores with ultrahigh NIR&#8208;II brightness, positioning PF8CN NPs as a strong contender in the field of NIR&#8208;II nanofluorophores</dc:description>

         <title>Spin Crossover and Its Application in Organometallic Catalysis: Concepts and Recent Progress</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 72, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article discusses the influence of spin crossover in open&#8208;shell metal catalytic reactions. It introduces the development of key concepts such as &#8220;two&#8208;state reactivity&#8221; and their impact on the field, proposing the concept of &#8220;spin&#8208;responsive catalysis&#8221; to encompass the effects of spin states, drawing on recent studies to highlight the role of spin crossover in reaction dynamics, pathways, and selectivity.







Abstract
Spin crossover is one of the most important properties of open&#8208;shell metal complexes. In organometallic catalytic reactions, catalysts can alter reaction kinetics by spin crossover, i.&#8201;e., accelerating or hindering the reaction progression, as well as altering reaction pathways, modulating the reaction selectivity or promoting new reactions. This personal account outlines the introduction and development of important concepts such as &#8220;two&#8208;state reactivity&#8221; involving spin crossover, and proposes a new concept, &#8220;spin&#8208;responsive catalysis&#8221; to summarize the catalytic processes in which spin effects are present. Finally, the electronic mechanism of spin crossover accelerating the reaction and the role of spin crossover in changing the reaction path and regulating the reaction selectivity are introduced by taking two recent typical iron&#8208;catalyzed reactions recently reported by our group as examples.

         <title>Neo&#8208;Glycolipid Oximes as Intestinal Permeation Enhancers for Peptide Hormone PYY3&#8208;36</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 72, December 23, 2024. </description>

Permeation enhancers optimized. Peptide hormone PYY3&#8208;36 transport across epithelial cell monolayers was facilitated by neo&#8208;glycolipids, selected from a combination of panels of mono&#8208; and disaccharides (blue circle in figure) with lipids comprising different length and terminal charge (red circle in figure).







Abstract
Herein, we describe the design and synthesis of 16 neo&#8208;glycolipids that are potential permeation enhancers for oral drug delivery of peptide therapeutics. These amphiphilic neo&#8208;glycolipids are composed of fatty acids and various carbohydrates (d&#8208;glucose, lactose, cellobiose, maltose) via an oxime linker. The ability of the synthesized neo&#8208;glycolipids to enhance permeation of fluorescein&#8208;labelled dextran (4&#8197;kDa) or 3H&#8208;mannitol across intestinal epithelium was investigated in&#8197;vitro using monolayers of human epithelial Caco&#8208;2 cells. Their effects were compared with (pre&#8208;)clinically known enhancers as reference compounds; sodium salts of octanoic, decanoic, and dodecanoic acid, and sodium salcaprozate (SNAC). Most neo&#8208;glycolipids increased the permeation of the model compounds, proving that neo&#8208;glycolipids, which possess vastly different properties from the reference compounds, e.&#8201;g., in terms of clogD and polar surface area, are effective permeation enhancers. The neo&#8208;glycolipid based on decanoic acid and glucose was more potent than related compounds based on disaccharides. Significant differences in solubility and cellular compatibility were found for neo&#8208;glyolipids based on different carbohydrates. Finally, neo&#8208;glycolipids were evaluated as permeation enhancers for the peptide hormone PYY3&#8208;36. Glucose&#8208; and maltose&#8208;derived neo&#8208;glycolipids based on decanoic and dodecanoic acid showed promising enhancements in PYY3&#8208;36 permeation in&#8197;vitro while maintaining good cellular compatibility, relevant for oral delivery of obesity treatments.

         <title>Nitrate&#8208;Anion&#8208;Induced Formation of a 2D Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with an Unconventional Kagom&#233; Lattice Exhibiting Methanol&#8208;Mediated Ketone Catalysis</title>

This study presents a synthesis of a stable 2D MOF with an unconventional kagom&#233; lattice, namely, [Na0.33Co(L)(CH3OH)2](NO3)0.33 via nitrate anion recognition using a multifunctional phosphonato&#8208;amino&#8208;carboxylate ligand. This kagom&#233; lattice is efficient for the &#945;&#8208;methoxymethylation and aminomethylation of aromatic ketones, which can be in&#8208;situ exfoliated into one layer MOF nanosheets under catalytic reaction conditions.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with kagom&#233; lattice are attractive for their unique physical and chemical properties, but little attention has been paid to their catalytic properties. Herein, we report a 2D MOF based on a phosphonato&#8208;amino&#8208;carboxylate ligand (NaHL), i.&#8201;e., [Na0.33Co(L)(CH3OH)2](NO3)0.33 (2), which exhibits an unconventional kagom&#233; lattice. The formation of this kagom&#233; lattice is caused by the selective recognition of the NO3&#8722; anion by the phenolato group of L2&#8722; as evidenced by theoretical calculations. Compound 2 can be utilized for the &#945;&#8208;methoxymethylation and aminomethylation of aromatic ketones using methanol as a C1 source. Interestingly, compound 2 can be exfoliated in&#8208;situ into nanosheets with one&#8208;layer thickness under catalytic reaction conditions, which improves the catalytic efficiency. Based on the results of experiments and theoretical calculations, we proposed possible pathways for the catalytic reaction.

         <title>Toughening Healable Supramolecular Double Polymer Networks Based on Hydrogen Bonding and Metal Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 72, December 23, 2024. </description>

We report supramolecular polymer double networks (DNs) based on poly(n&#8208;butyl acrylate)s featuring orthogonally responsive 2&#8208;ureido&#8208;4[1H]pyrimidinone (UPy) and 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes between 2,6&#8208;bis(1&#8242;&#8208;methylbenzimidazolyl)pyridine (MeBip) ligand and Zn2+ ions as cross&#8208;links. The supramolecular DN exhibits thermal stability, creep resistance, excellent healability, and improved elongation and toughness.







Abstract
Double polymer networks (DNs) consist of two interpenetrating polymer networks and can offer properties that are not merely a sum of the parts. Here, we report an elastic DN made from two supramolecular polymers (SMPs) that consist of the same poly(n&#8208;butyl acrylate) (BA) backbone. The two polymers feature different non&#8208;covalent binding motifs, which form dynamic, reversible cross&#8208;links. The polymers were prepared by reversible addition&#8722;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer polymerization of n&#8208;butyl acrylate and either the self&#8208;complementary hydrogen&#8208;bonding motif 2&#8208;ureido&#8208;4[1H]pyrimidinone, or the 2,6&#8208;bis(1&#8242;&#8208;methylbenzimidazolyl)pyridine ligand, which forms complexes with metal ions. The supramolecular DN made by these components combines features of the single networks, including high thermal stability and resistance to creep. The DN further exhibits excellent healability and displays a higher extensibility and a higher toughness than its constituents. The mechanical characteristics of the DN can be further enhanced by selectively pre&#8208;stretching one of the networks, which is readily possible due to the reversible formation of the supramolecular cross&#8208;links and their orthogonal stimuli&#8208;responsiveness.

         <title>Reactivity of Polynuclear Niobium Oxynitride Cluster Anions Nb4N5&#8208;xOx&#8722; (x=0&#8211;5) toward N2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 72, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Significant regulation of the reactivity of polynuclear niobium oxynitride clusters with the N/O ratio was observed experimentally. By the complementary of quantum chemistry calculations, the uncommon side&#8208;on/end&#8208;on coordination mode of N2 on the dual metal centers was identified and the natural charge environment at the active sites resulting from the modulation of N/O ratio is responsible for the reactivity variation.







Abstract
The activation of N&#8322; under mild conditions remains a significant challenge in chemistry. Understanding how the composition of ligands modulates the reactivity of metal centers is pivotal for the rational design of efficient catalysts for nitrogen fixation. Herein, the reactions between polynuclear niobium oxynitride anions Nb4N5&#8208;xOx&#8722; (x=0&#8211;5) and N2 were investigated by employing mass spectrometry, photoelectron imaging spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations. The rate constants of Nb4N5&#8208;xOx&#8722;/N2 gradually decrease for x=0 to x=4, and then increase again for x=5. The sharp increase of the rate constants of Nb4O5&#8722;/N2 corresponds to a decrease in the electron detachment energy of the Nb4O5&#8722; cluster in the photoelectron spectroscopic experiments. Theoretical calculations suggest that the low&#8208;coordinated Nb&#8722;Nb sites in Nb4N5&#8208;xOx&#8722; (x=0&#8211;5) behaves as the active centers to bind N2 in the side&#8208;on/end&#8208;on manner. Mechanistic analysis reveals that reducing the N/O ratio leads to higher electron densities on the active Nb&#8722;Nb centers and decreased positive charge on the metal atoms, which hinders the approach of N2 to the clusters. This finding discloses fundamental insights into the impact of N/O ratio in fine&#8208;tuning the reactivity of metal centers toward N2 adsorption in related catalytic processes.

         <title>Photooxidation of Toluene Derivatives under HAT and ROS Synergy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 72, December 23, 2024. </description>

This study synergistically combines hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation to achieve efficient photocatalytic oxidation of toluene derivatives with low catalyst loading as well as mild conditions, yielding benzoic acid derivatives and aryl ketones, thereby enhancing catalytic efficiency while ensuring both ecological sustainability and economic viability.







Abstract
The valorization of toluene offers a dual solution by addressing its environmental impact while also facilitating the synthesis of a diverse array of valuable fine chemicals and pharmaceutical intermediates, thus ensuring both ecological sustainability and economic viability. We report herein a synergistic approach that harmonizes hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under mild condition and low catalyst loading, which enables the efficient synthesis of a broad spectrum of esteemed benzoic acid derivatives and aryl ketones through the photocatalytic oxidation of toluene derivatives. Mechanistic elucidation reveals that the HAT reagent anthraquinone has both the capabilities to abstract hydrogen atoms and the ability to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) during energy transfer with triplet oxygen (3O2), and the combination of these two potencies significantly improves the catalytic efficiency of the reaction. This study not only introduces the amalgamation of HAT with ROS generation but also delineates a systematic approach for the selection of HAT reagents with energy transfer proficiency for ROS generation in catalytic oxidation reactions.

         <title>Steric Activation in the Nazarov Cyclization of Fully Substituted Divinyl Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 72, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contrary to expectations, the Nazarov cyclization of fully substituted divinyl ketones bearing only electronically neutral (non&#8208;activating) substituents has been found to be extraordinarily facile. Indeed, increasing the size of R&#8208;groups, including those at the point of ring closure, can increase the cyclization rate. Steric interactions between R&#8208;groups and OA deflect the pentadienyl cation intermediate from planarity, thus raising its energy and reducing the barrier height to cyclization.







Abstract
Fully substituted divinyl ketones (fsDVKs) have long been regarded as resistant to Nazarov cyclization (NC) unless they contain strategically positioned electronically activating substituents. Here, however, we show that fsDVKs bearing only electronically neutral alkyl or aryl groups actually undergo facile NC due to steric crowding in the pentadienyl cation intermediate, which raises its energy and reduces the barrier height to cyclization. Strongly ionizing and suitably bulky acid moieties further increase the energy of this intermediate cation, favoring cyclization. These features enable NCs of fsDVKs to be employed in the ready construction of multiple contiguous all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters under mild conditions, in the absence of electronically activating groups.

         <title>Model Catalytic Studies on the Thermal Dehydrogenation of the Benzaldehyde/Cyclohexylmethanol LOHC System on Pt(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 72, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dehydrogenation mechanism and thermal robustness of the liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC) couple benzaldehyde/cyclohexylmethanol (H0&#8208;BA/H8&#8208;BA) are investigated in&#8197;situ on Pt(111) by synchrotron radiation&#8208;based photoelectron spectroscopy and temperature&#8208;programmed desorption. The results are compared with a previous study on the structurally related secondary alcohol 1&#8208;cyclohexylethanol, demonstrating the influence of the substitution degree of the alcohol group on the dehydrogenation characteristics of alcohol&#8208;functionalized LOHCs.







Abstract
We investigated the dehydrogenation reaction and the thermal robustness of the liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC) couple benzaldehyde/cyclohexylmethanol on a Pt(111) model catalyst in&#8197;situ in synchrotron radiation photoelectron spectroscopy&#8208; and complementary temperature&#8208;programmed desorption experiments. The system stores hydrogen in a cyclohexyl group and a primary alcohol functionality and achieves an attractive hydrogen storage capacity of 7.0&#8197;mass&#8201;%. We observed a stepwise dehydrogenation mechanism, characterized by a low temperature dehydrogenation of the alcohol group at 235&#8197;K. However, stability limitations challenge the system's application as reversible hydrogen storage solution, as the resultant aldehyde was found to decompose during the dehydrogenation of its cyclohexyl group (between 250 and 350&#8197;K). A comparison of cyclohexylmethanol with the structurally related secondary alcohol (1&#8208;cyclohexylethanol; 6.3&#8197;mass&#8201;% hydrogen) revealed a parallel stepwise dehydrogenation pattern for both compounds, but a technically relevant superior thermal robustness of the latter, demonstrating the influence of the alcohol&#8208;group's substitution degree on the dehydrogenation characteristics of alcohol&#8208;functionalized LOHCs. Density functional theory calculations are in agreement with the experimentally observed stability trend.

         <title>Oxidative Cleavage of Aromatic C&#8722;O Linkages by Oxoammonium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 72, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidative cleavage of aromatic C(sp2)&#8722;O bond is implemented using water as oxygen source and oxoammonium salt as oxidant, which is efficiently applied into cleavage of lignin model compounds and depolymerization of PPO. The oxoammonium cation activates water to form hydroxy&#8208;oxoammonium adduct, which plays the key role in the oxidative cleavage. The recycling of oxoammonium cation is confirmed via electrolysis.







Abstract
Oxidative cleavage of aromatic C(sp2)&#8722;O bond is important to the conversion of biomass and plastic wastes into value&#8208;added chemicals. Here we put forward the oxidative cleavage of para&#8208;C&#8722;O bonds in phenolic compounds in use of oxoammonium salts as oxidant and water as the oxygen source. The mechanism is that oxoammonium cation activates water to form hydroxy&#8208;oxoammonium adduct and thus realizes the ipso&#8208;substitution of 4&#8208;alkoxyphenol, which is proved by substituent effect, isotope labelling experiments, and kinetic analysis. Furthermore, this protocol is successfully applied into the depolymerization of both lignin model compounds with &#945;&#8208;O&#8208;5 and 4&#8208;O&#8208;5 linkages and polyphenylene oxide (PPO).

         <title>Stable Cu (I) Complexes for Intracellular Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Azide Alkyne Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 72, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An original azole ligand scaffold has been used to create a Cu (I) trinuclear dimer, demonstrating air&#8208; and water&#8208;stability due to its linear molecular geometry around the metal center. The complex is characterized and shown to efficiently catalyze the CuAAC reaction in aqueous media at low loading, as well as on fixed cells.







Abstract
The copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) has heralded a new era of chemical biology and biomedicine. However, caveats of the CuAAC include formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other copper&#8208;related toxicity. This limits utility in sensitive biological samples and matrices. Towards addressing these caveats, we synthesized and fully characterized two air and water stable trinuclear Cu(I) dimer complexes. The complexes were stable to oxidation in the presence of hydrogen peroxideand other chelators, which was reasoned to be due to the linear benzimidazole&#8208;Cu&#8208;benzimidazole geometry. Computational investigations of the catalytic cycle implicated two of the three coppers in the trimer complex as the active metal centers. The complexes were shown to catalyze the reaction at far below sub&#8208;toxic concentrations for intracellular click reactions to label triple negative breast cancer cells and compared to the current CuSO4&#8208;THPTA standard.

         <title>Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells with Efficient Charge Mobility and Separation Capabilities Studied by DFT</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 72, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of heterojunction organic solar cells were designed using bacteriochlorin as a donor. They exhibit efficient charge mobility and separation rates, which provide theoretical guidance for constructing new low&#8208;cost and highly efficient BHJ organic solar cells.







Abstract
The properties of the active layer materials play a decisive role in determining the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs). Chlorophyll and its derivatives are abundant and environmentally friendly functional organic molecular materials. Using density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT), we have calculated the absorption spectra and their excited state properties based on optimized ground state structures. It was found that bacteriochlorin exhibits superior structural properties, a smaller energy gap and hole reorganization energy, redshifted absorption spectra, and higher hole mobility compared to the donor D18. This suggests that bacteriochlorin exhibits superior donor properties. Comparative studies between o&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl and m&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl showed that o&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl had superior acceptor properties, implying that differences in substitution positions can influence the physicochemical properties of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs). Subsequently, six bulk heterojunctions (BHJs) were constructed by combining three donors with nonfused ring electron acceptors, o&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl and m&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl. The bacteriochlorin&#8208;based BHJs performed well among them, with BChl3/o&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl and BChl4/o&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl having the largest interfacial charge separation rate. The results suggested that BHJs composed of bacteriochlorin and NFAs can improve OSCs&#8217; photovoltaic performance, providing a feasible scheme for designing efficient OSCs.

     alt="Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells with Efficient Charge Mobility and Separation Capabilities Studied by DFT"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new series of heterojunction organic solar cells were designed using bacteriochlorin as a donor. They exhibit efficient charge mobility and separation rates, which provide theoretical guidance for constructing new low-cost and highly efficient BHJ organic solar cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The properties of the active layer materials play a decisive role in determining the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs). Chlorophyll and its derivatives are abundant and environmentally friendly functional organic molecular materials. Using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), we have calculated the absorption spectra and their excited state properties based on optimized ground state structures. It was found that bacteriochlorin exhibits superior structural properties, a smaller energy gap and hole reorganization energy, redshifted absorption spectra, and higher hole mobility compared to the donor D18. This suggests that bacteriochlorin exhibits superior donor properties. Comparative studies between o-AT-2Cl and m-AT-2Cl showed that o-AT-2Cl had superior acceptor properties, implying that differences in substitution positions can influence the physicochemical properties of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs). Subsequently, six bulk heterojunctions (BHJs) were constructed by combining three donors with nonfused ring electron acceptors, o-AT-2Cl and m-AT-2Cl. The bacteriochlorin-based BHJs performed well among them, with BChl3/o-AT-2Cl and BChl4/o-AT-2Cl having the largest interfacial charge separation rate. The results suggested that BHJs composed of bacteriochlorin and NFAs can improve OSCs&#8217; photovoltaic performance, providing a feasible scheme for designing efficient OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Networked Multicomponent Ensemble as AND Gate with FRET Output</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 72, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on two metal ions inputs (Hg2+ and Li+) a networked six&#8208;component ensemble AND gate has been fabricated. The performance of the gate is evaluated by FRET emission of rhodamine receptor which is controlled by the logic operation of the gate. Application of only one input, does not produce any output result of the gate. Upon addition of both the inputs only, Cu+ ion is released to solution as primary output. The released Cu+ binds with the receptor and ignite a FRET transition. The strict stoichiometric inputs and output of the gate allowa highly defined communication between different parts of the gate. The smooth molecular cybernetics in the multicomponent ensemble is a lucid example that encourages us for further work in controlling intricate mutually dependent supramolecular devices or further complex logic circuits operation. A six&#8208;component AND gate using input of Hg2+ and Li+ ions releases stoichiometric Cu+ which triggers FRET emission in a rhodamine receptor upon binding. Only dual inputs activate the gate, demonstrating precise communication for complex molecular logic circuits.







Abstract
A networked supramolecular logic AND gate system is accomplished using precise chemical communication within a multicomponent ensemble via metal ion&#8208;driven self&#8208;sorting processes. The cybernetic AND gate is composed of a copper(I)&#8208;loaded nanoswitch, an aza&#8208;crown ether and a rhodamine receptor. The modus operandi of the AND gate, from state (0,0), was induced with stoichiometric amounts of two inputs (IN&#8208;1=Hg2+, IN&#8208;2=Li+) generating copper(I) ions as output only in state (1,1). Generation of state (1,1) from state (0,0) involves selective Cu+ ion translocation from the nanoswitch to the aza&#8208;crown ether in the first step (IN&#8208;1) and then from the aza&#8208;crown ether to the rhodamine receptor in the second step (IN&#8208;2). The released copper(I) output acts as a messenger that binds to the rhodamine receptor, triggering it's spiro&#8208;lactam ring opening, which leads to a diagnostic FRET emission from the copper(I)&#8208;loaded rhodamine scaffold accompanied by a remarkable fluorescence and colour change from pale yellow to pink.

Light&#8208;assisted assembly: The photosubstitution reactions of a ruthenium precursor complex with bridging ligands having pyrazole moieties afford oligomeric ruthenium complexes. The photochemically synthesized ruthenium complexes act as synthons for longer metal&#8208;complex&#8208;based nanowires with a length of the order of tens&#8208;of nanometers.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled oligonuclear and polynuclear complexes have numerous functionalities and potential applications. Generally, such compounds have been constructed by thermal substitution reactions with bridging ligands. Herein, we report bottom&#8208;up and photochemical construction of functional coordination oligomers and polymers by photosubstitution&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly. The photosubstitution reactions of a ruthenium precursor complex with bridging ligands having pyrazole moieties afford mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, and pentanuclear ruthenium complexes, Ru1&#8211;Ru5, which have one&#8208;dimensional architectures. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding between each bridging ligand is a key to construct the molecular nanowires. All the complexes have been isolated and thoroughly characterized. The photochemically synthesized ruthenium complexes act as synthons for longer metal&#8208;complex&#8208;based nanowires with a length of the order of tens&#8208;of nanometers. The multinuclear complexes are generated by photoinduced self&#8208;assembly in the presence of a base, and they undergo photoinduced disassembly in the presence of acid.

Trace iridium modified NiFe phosphide (Ir&#8208;NiFePx/CC) was in&#8208;situ grown on carbon cloth by a simple wet chemical method, followed by a phosphorization post treatment at a relatively low temperature. The best&#8208;performing electrocatalyst, Ir2&#8208;NiFePx/CC, shows excellent OER activity, with an overpotential of 190&#8197;mV for alkaline OER at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an ideal long&#8208;term stability over 90&#8197;h.







Abstract
Cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts is a key constituent to establish the balance of cost and catalytic efficiency for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via water electrolysis in the area of energy conversion and storage. NiFe phosphide decorated with trace amount of iridium (Ir) species in&#8208;situ grown on carbon cloth was prepared by a facile wet chemistry approach followed by a phosphorization post&#8208;treatment at a relative low temperature. The optimal electrocatalyst, Ir2&#8208;NiFePx/CC, exhibits excellent OER activity, with an low overpotential of 190&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for alkaline OER, and a desirable long&#8208;term durability over 90&#8197;h. The outstanding OER performance stems from the structural evolution via phosphorization process, Ir decoration with more high&#8208;valence stated Ir4+ species, and tight connection between individual components of the electrode, which gives rise to the strong activity to the active sites and faster reaction kinetics in the alkaline OER process. Mover, the Ir loading was as low as approximately ~1.7&#8197;wt&#8201;% (0.29&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2), showing promissing propective in cost&#8208;effective OER.

         <title>Regulating Solvated Sheath with Anion Chelant Enables 4.6&#8197;V Ultra&#8208;Stable Commercial LiCoO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 72, December 23, 2024. </description>

We employ an electrolyte additive strategy to stabilize commercial LiCoO2 at high&#8208;voltage of 4.6&#8197;V. The anion&#8208;chelating agent (ACA) TPFPB promotes the F&#8208;rich CEI formation on LiCoO2, which endows Li/LCO half cells and 4&#8197;Ah Gr/LCO pouch cell with enhanced cycling stability under the high voltage condition.







Abstract
Increasing cut&#8208;off voltage of lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) (&gt;4.6&#8197;V) is an effective strategy to satisfy the ever&#8208;increasing demand for high energy density. However, the irreversible phase transition significantly destroys the structure of high&#8208;voltage LCO, especially the surface lattice. Considering that the structural stability of LCO is primarily dominated by the intrinsic merits of electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface (EEI), we explored and disclosed the operating mechanism of anion chelating agent tris(pentafluorophenyl) borane (TPFPB) and regulate the CEI layer on LCO electrode. Benefiting from the high HOMO energy level and preferential decomposition of TPFPB&#8208;PF6&#8722;, a robust LiF&#8208;rich CEI layer is constructed and greatly improves the stability of electrode/electrolyte interface. The well&#8208;designed electrolyte composed of 1&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 LiPF6 in EC/EMC with TPFPB additives endows Li/LCO half cells and 4&#8197;Ah Gr/LCO pouch cell with enhanced cycling stability under a high voltage condition. This work provides pave a new direction for the development of economical high&#8208;voltage LIBs.

&lt;p&gt;Increasing cut-off voltage of lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) (&amp;gt;4.6&#8197;V) is an effective strategy to satisfy the ever-increasing demand for high energy density. However, the irreversible phase transition significantly destroys the structure of high-voltage LCO, especially the surface lattice. Considering that the structural stability of LCO is primarily dominated by the intrinsic merits of electrode-electrolyte interface (EEI), we explored and disclosed the operating mechanism of anion chelating agent tris(pentafluorophenyl) borane (TPFPB) and regulate the CEI layer on LCO electrode. Benefiting from the high HOMO energy level and preferential decomposition of TPFPB-PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, a robust LiF-rich CEI layer is constructed and greatly improves the stability of electrode/electrolyte interface. The well-designed electrolyte composed of 1&#8197;mol&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; LiPF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; in EC/EMC with TPFPB additives endows Li/LCO half cells and 4&#8197;Ah Gr/LCO pouch cell with enhanced cycling stability under a high voltage condition. This work provides pave a new direction for the development of economical high-voltage LIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Responsive Fluorescent Diarylethene Having a Betaine Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 72, December 23, 2024. </description>

Introduction of a pyridinium N&#8208;enolate betaine structure to photochromic diarylethene leads to significant red shifts of absorption spectra in both open&#8208;ring and closed&#8208;ring forms and provides the molecule with fluorescing ability. The diarylethene undergoes efficient turn&#8208;off mode switching of fluorescence upon photocyclization induced by 405&#8197;nm light in solution and polymer films.







Abstract
As a new molecular scaffold of photoswitchable fluorophore, we developed a photochromic diarylethene containing a betaine structure based on pyridinium N&#8208;enolate. A facile reaction of a pyridyl&#8208;substituted dithienylperfluorocyclopentene derivative with octafluorocyclopentene constructed the betaine structure. The introduction of the betaine moiety provided the diarylethene molecule with bathochromically shifted optical absorption and fluorescing ability, thus enabling the molecule to function as a visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive turn&#8208;off mode photoswitchable fluorophore. The molecule in the open&#8208;ring form emitted bright bluish green fluorescence. Upon irradiation with 405&#8197;nm light, the molecule underwent cyclization isomerization to form the closed&#8208;ring isomer and the fluorescence intensity significantly decreased. The turn&#8208;off mode fluorescence photoswitching was observed not only in solution but also in polymer films.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Induced Aromatic Substitution: A Study on Guanidino&#8208;Functionalized Aromatics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 72, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidation of a redox&#8208;active aromatic molecule leads to an umpolung from a nucleophile to an electrophile, enabling addition of a nucleophile as part of an aromatic substitution. Thereby a variety of new, non&#8208;symmetrically substituted redox&#8208;active compounds could be synthesized. Several reactions of redox&#8208;active guanidino&#8208;substituted benzene molecules are reported. In some cases redox&#8208;induced aromatic substitution is part of a reaction cascade.







Abstract
Aromatic substitution of redox&#8208;active aromatic compounds could be initiated by a preceding redox step. We report on the different reaction pathways of such redox&#8208;induced substitution (RIAS) reactions between a redox&#8208;active guanidino&#8208;functionalized aromatic molecule (GFA) and an amine or guanidine. Oxidation of the GFA leads to an umpolung of the guanidine from a nucleophile to an electrophile and thereby enables addition of the amine or guanidine. Several examples are given, demonstrating the use of redox substitution in synthetic chemistry, e.&#8201;g. for the convenient synthesis of novel N&#8208;heteropolycyclic molecules and unsymmetrically&#8208;substituted aromatics.

         <title>Emergent Behavior of a Photoswitchable Solute in a Biphasic Solvent System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 72, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple approach to complex behavior is provided by placing a photoswitch in a two&#8208;phase system. Depending on which phase is irradiated, different out of equilibrium stationary states can be accessed, including photostationary states not accessible in either of the pure phases.







Abstract
Due to thermal E/Z isomerization, hydrazones in solution typically exist in thermodynamic equilibria between their isomers. Irradiation of such solutions leads to photostationary states that may differ from the equilibrium distribution. Operating such switchable hydrazones in a biphasic system of two immiscible solvents introduces three new degrees of freedom: the E/Z equilibrium in the second solvent and two equilibria for distribution of each of the isomers between the solvents. Irradiation of such a system can be performed in three different ways &#8211; the first solvent only, the second solvent only, and both solvents at once &#8211; all yielding distinct outcomes. Depending on the choice of materials and the mode of irradiation, such setup may lead to different emergent behaviors that are not immediately intuitive, including net cyclic transport or the accumulation of one photoswitched product in one of the phases, beyond what is reachable by irradiating a simple solution of the same photoswitch.

         <title>Endogenous Cu(II) Labeling for Distance Measurements on Proteins by EPR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 72, December 23, 2024. </description>

Quick and easy endogenous spin labeling: This work shows that hypotonic swelling is a reproducible and facile method to endogenously label proteins with Cu(II) protein spin label in E.&#8197;coli cells. The method enables the facile measurement of structural constraints in&#8208;cells. The figure was made using BioRender.com.







Abstract
In&#8208;cell measurements of the relationship between structure and dynamics to protein function is at the forefront of biophysics. Recently, developments in EPR methodology have demonstrated the sensitivity and power of this method to measure structural constraints in&#8208;cell. However, the need to spin label proteins ex&#8208;situ or use noncanonical amino acids to achieve endogenous labeling remains a bottleneck. In this work we expand the methodology to endogenously spin label proteins with Cu(II) spin labels and describe how to assess in&#8208;cell spin labeling. We quantify the amount of Cu(II)&#8208;NTA in cells, assess spin labeling, and account for orientational effects during distance measurements. We compare the efficacy of using heat&#8208;shock and hypotonic swelling to deliver spin label, showing that hypotonic swelling is a facile and reproducible method to efficiently deliver Cu(II)&#8208;NTA into E.&#8197;coli. Notably, over six repeats we accomplish a bulk average of 57&#8197;&#956;M spin labeled sites, surpassing existing endogenous labeling methods. The results of this work open the door for endogenous spin labeling that is easily accessible to the broader biophysical community.

         <title>Regulating Zn Deposition Manner by Confining the Reactivity of Free Water in the Electric Double Layer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 72, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the poor reversibility of Zn anode, we propose to use benzotriazole as decent electrolyte additive to confine the reactivity of free water in the electric double layer, which can adsorb on the surface of Zn metal and then react with Zn2+ to form solid Zn&#8208;BTA complexes on the Zn anode surface.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising candidates of next&#8208;generation energy storage devices with high safety and theoretical capacity. However, the irreversibility of metallic Zn anode, attributed to dendrite growth and water decomposition, severely limits the cycling durability of AZIBs and restricts their further development. Herein, a facile surface engineering strategy is put forward to tackle the issue of poor reversibility of the Zn anode. Benzotriazole (BTA) is employed as a functional additive of ZnSO4 electrolyte to confine the reactivity of free water situated in the electric double layer (EDL). Experimental results and theoretical simulation reveal that BTA can preferiencially adsorb onto the Zn surface to uniform Zn2+ ion distribution and alleviate H2O&#8208;involved side reactions like hydrogen evolution, and surface passivation. Consequently, in BTA&#8208;modulated aqueous electrolyte, the lifespan of the Zn anode is extended from 170&#8197;h&#8211;1092&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

&lt;p&gt;To address the poor reversibility of Zn anode, we propose to use benzotriazole as decent electrolyte additive to confine the reactivity of free water in the electric double layer, which can adsorb on the surface of Zn metal and then react with Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to form solid Zn-BTA complexes on the Zn anode surface.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous Zn ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising candidates of next-generation energy storage devices with high safety and theoretical capacity. However, the irreversibility of metallic Zn anode, attributed to dendrite growth and water decomposition, severely limits the cycling durability of AZIBs and restricts their further development. Herein, a facile surface engineering strategy is put forward to tackle the issue of poor reversibility of the Zn anode. Benzotriazole (BTA) is employed as a functional additive of ZnSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyte to confine the reactivity of free water situated in the electric double layer (EDL). Experimental results and theoretical simulation reveal that BTA can preferiencially adsorb onto the Zn surface to uniform Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion distribution and alleviate H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-involved side reactions like hydrogen evolution, and surface passivation. Consequently, in BTA-modulated aqueous electrolyte, the lifespan of the Zn anode is extended from 170&#8197;h&#8211;1092&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;/1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The reversibility improvement of Zn anode also benefits the cycling durability of full devices including supercapacitors and batteries. Zn||I&#8322; batteries assembled in as-designed electrolyte witness only 11.3&#8201;% capacity decay over 17000 cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, far outstripping that observed in ZnSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; counterpart (~4675 cycles). The design criteria proposed in this study offers a new concept for the development of regulation additives that confine the reactivity of free water in the electric double layer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unprecedented Cubic Mesomorphic Behaviour of Crown&#8208;Ether Functionalized Amphiphilic Cyclodextrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 72, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crown&#8208;ether&#8208;functionalized amphiphilic &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrins have been shown for the first time to form thermotropic bicontinuous cubic mesophases without relying on other mesogenic groups, uncover a simple and practical strategy to alter the phase behavior of macrocyclic supramolecular liquid crystals via the tuning of the volume fractions of the hydrophilic domains of the mesogens. Solid&#8208;state NMR studies revealed such materials to conduct Li+ ion transport with a very low activation energy.







Abstract
Amphiphilic supramolecular materials based on biodegradable cyclodextrins (CDs) have been known to self&#8208;assemble into different types of thermotropic liquid crystals, including smectic and hexagonal columnar mesophases. Previous studies on amphiphilic CDs bearing 14 aliphatic chains at the secondary face and 7 oligoethylene glycol (OEG) chains at the primary face showed that the stability of the mesophase can be rationally tuned through implementation of terminal functional groups to the OEG chains. Here, we report the syntheses of first examples of crown ether&#8208;functionalized amphiphilic cyclodextrins that unexpectedly form thermotropic bicontinuous cubic phases. This constitutes the first reported examples of cyclodextrins forming such phases, which are potentially capable of 3D ion transport. Lithium composites were made to assess lithium conduction in the material. XRD revealed the added lithium salt destabilizes the cubic phase in favour of the smectic phase. Solid&#8208;state NMR studies showed that these materials conduct lithium ions with a very low activation energy.

In this study, we developed a novel method for converting double&#8208;stranded DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (dsDELs) to single&#8208;stranded DELs (ssDELs) with compounds at the 3&#8217; end using cleavabledeoxyuridine. Moreover, such ssDELs are converted to dsDELs with the coding information covalently attached to photo&#8208;crosslinkers (dsDELs&#8208;PC). This approach enhances photo&#8208;crosslinking selection efficiency, maintaining high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise (S/N) ratios under stringent conditions.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL) technology is a crucial tool in pharmaceutical research, rapidly identifying compounds that bind to a target of interest from an extensive pool of compounds. In this study, we propose a new method for generating single&#8208;stranded DELs (ssDELs) with compounds at the 3&#8217; end. The introduction of uniquely designed hairpin&#8208;shaped headpieces containing deoxyuridine (NC&#8208;HP) and the use of a cleavage enzyme facilitate the conversion from double&#8208;stranded DELs (dsDELs) to such ssDELs. Moreover, Klenow fill&#8208;in provides the dsDELs with photo&#8208;crosslinkers covalently linked to the coding region, which exhibit durability even under stringent washing conditions and enable photo&#8208;crosslinking with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, as also confirmed in cell&#8208;based photo&#8208;crosslinking selections.

Co2P2O7&#8208;MoN/NC exhibits a superior OER performance in an alkaline medium, delivering an overpotential of 278&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a Tafel slope of 83.3&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, and long&#8208;term durability over 100&#8197;h. The structural synergy among pyrophosphate, nitride, N&#8208;doped carbon, and the new&#8208;formed CoOOH nanosheets prompts the enhancement of the OER performance significantly.







Abstract
Realizing efficient and durable non&#8208;precious metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) still remains a great challenge. Here, a multi&#8208;component composite of Co2P2O7&#8208;MoN/NC containing pyrophosphate, nitride, and nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon is successfully prepared via a facile two&#8208;step synthesis method. Combining the structural regulation between the active metal&#8208; and non&#8208;metal&#8208;based species, Co2P2O7&#8208;MoN/NC demonstrates superior activity and durability for OER, requiring an overpotential of 278&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a Tafel slope of 83.3&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, and long&#8208;term stability over 100&#8197;h in an alkaline solution. Post&#8208;characterizations reveal that synergistic effect among stable Co2P2O7, partially dissolved MoN, N&#8208;doped carbon, and new&#8208;formed CoOOH nanosheets enable structural reconstruction, fast charge transfer, and formation of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates, promoting the OER performance significantly. This work provides a promising pathway to tune multi&#8208;components to fabricate efficient transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts in energy conversion applications.

         <title>Engineering Interfacial Molecular Interactions on Ag Hollow Fibre Gas Diffusion Electrodes for High Efficiency in CO2 Conversion to CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 72, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The silver hollow fibre gas diffusion electrode (Ag HFGDE) acts as a CO2 diffuser through the porous wall, effectively converting CO2 to CO in a wide potential range. CTAB molecules at the electrode/electrolyte interface promoted CO2 penetration to active sites and repelled water to reduce the activity of competitive hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) occurs at the nanoscale interface of the electrode&#8208;electrolyte. Therefore, tailoring the interfacial properties in the interface microenvironment provides a powerful strategy to optimise the activity and selectivity of electrocatalysts towards the desired products. Here, the microenvironment at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface of the flow&#8208;through Ag&#8208;based hollow fibre gas diffusion electrode (Ag HFGDE) is modulated by introducing surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as the electrolyte additive. The porous hollow fibre configuration and gas penetration mode facilitate the CO2 mass transfer and the formation of the triple&#8208;phase interface. Through the ordered arrangement of hydrophobic long&#8208;alkyl chains, CTAB molecules at the electrode/electrolyte interface promoted CO2 penetration to active sites and repelled water to reduce the activity of competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). By applying CTAB&#8208;containing catholyte, Ag HFGDE achieved a high CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) of over 95&#8201;% in a wide potential range and double the partial current density of CO. The enhancement of CO selectivity and suppression of hydrogen was attributed to the improvement of charge transfer and the CO2/H2O ratio enhancement. These findings highlight the importance of adjusting the local microenvironment to enhance the reaction kinetics and product selectivity in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction CO2RR.

     alt="Engineering Interfacial Molecular Interactions on Ag Hollow Fibre Gas Diffusion Electrodes for High Efficiency in CO2 Conversion to CO"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The silver hollow fibre gas diffusion electrode (Ag HFGDE) acts as a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; diffuser through the porous wall, effectively converting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO in a wide potential range. CTAB molecules at the electrode/electrolyte interface promoted CO2 penetration to active sites and repelled water to reduce the activity of competitive hydrogen evolution reaction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) occurs at the nanoscale interface of the electrode-electrolyte. Therefore, tailoring the interfacial properties in the interface microenvironment provides a powerful strategy to optimise the activity and selectivity of electrocatalysts towards the desired products. Here, the microenvironment at the electrode-electrolyte interface of the flow-through Ag-based hollow fibre gas diffusion electrode (Ag HFGDE) is modulated by introducing surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as the electrolyte additive. The porous hollow fibre configuration and gas penetration mode facilitate the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mass transfer and the formation of the triple-phase interface. Through the ordered arrangement of hydrophobic long-alkyl chains, CTAB molecules at the electrode/electrolyte interface promoted CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; penetration to active sites and repelled water to reduce the activity of competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). By applying CTAB-containing catholyte, Ag HFGDE achieved a high CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) of over 95&#8201;% in a wide potential range and double the partial current density of CO. The enhancement of CO selectivity and suppression of hydrogen was attributed to the improvement of charge transfer and the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ratio enhancement. These findings highlight the importance of adjusting the local microenvironment to enhance the reaction kinetics and product selectivity in the electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Targeted and Untargeted Amine Metabolite Quantitation in Single Cells with Isobaric Multiplexing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 72, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isobaric labeling for single&#8208;cell metabolomics involves multiplexing six individually prepared and labeled cells with an analyte&#8208;abundant carrier. The isobaric reagents contain stable isotopes at different locations (i.e. isotopomers), creating superimposed peaks in mass spectrometry (MS1), which can be resolved using tandem mass spectrometry (MS2). Using an abundant analyte carrier with one isotopomer helps mitigate sample losses.







Abstract
We developed a single cell amine analysis approach utilizing isobarically multiplexed samples of 6 individual cells along with analyte abundant carrier. This methodology was applied for absolute quantitation of amino acids and untargeted relative quantitation of amines in a total of 108 individual cells using nanoflow LC with high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry. Together with individually determined cell sizes, this provides accessible quantification of intracellular amino acid concentrations within individual cells. The targeted method was partially validated for 10 amino acids with limits of detection in low attomoles, linear calibration range covering analyte amounts typically from 30&#8197;amol to 120&#8197;fmol, and correlation coefficients (R) above 0.99. This was applied with cell sizes recorded during dispensing to determine millimolar intracellular amino acid concentrations. The untargeted approach yielded 249 features that were detected in at least 25&#8201;% of the single cells, providing modest cell type separation on principal component analysis. Using Greedy forward selection with regularized least squares, a sub&#8208;selection of 100 features explaining most of the difference was determined. These features were annotated using MS2 from analyte standards and accurate mass with library search. The approach provides accessible, sensitive, and high&#8208;throughput method with the potential to be expanded also to other forms of ultrasensitive analysis.

         <title>Demonstrating Synergistic Activity of Magnetic Iron Oxide Nano Photocatalyst for C&#8722;H Activation in Heterogeneous Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 72, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This protocol represents a novel and environmentally benign arylation approach under mild conditions in the heterogeneous phase by merging cooperative photoredox and C&#8722;H activation. Magnetically isolable iron oxide nanoparticles are employed as potent photocatalysts for C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2) bond&#8208;forming methods with a broad range of substrates. Detailed mechanistic investigations are performed to justify the presented scientific advancements.







Abstract
This report describes a dual catalytic approach for the versatile C&#8722;H arylation of arenes under photo&#8208;excitation at room temperature. The cooperative catalysis utilizes iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (which mostly contain Fe3O4 along with some &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3) as the potential photocatalyst, which merges with the Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation cycle for the reductive generation of aryl radical from aryl diazonium salt, revealing its photocatalytic activities. The method is applicable to a wide range of aryl coupling partners and different directing groups, demonstrating excellent productivity, nice co&#8208;operativity and recyclability. Adequate control experiments and mechanistic studies assisted in establishing the radical&#8208;based reaction mechanism for the C&#8722;H arylation occurring in the heterogeneous phase.

         <title>Formal Transformation of Benzylic Carboxylic Acids to Phenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 72, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of phenols from the benzylic carboxylic acids is described herein. The photocatalytic conversion of carboxylic acids to peroxides represents a pivotal step in this strategy, facilitating the subsequent C&#8722;O bond formation via Hock rearrangement.







Abstract
Phenols play a crucial role as core structural motifs in natural products and also serve as fundamental building blocks in synthetic chemistry. Apart from the known protocols for the conversion of aryl precursors to phenols (i.&#8201;e., decarboxylative oxygenation), we report here the efficient synthesis of phenols from the stable and readily available benzylic carboxylic acids under mild reaction conditions. The photocatalytic conversion of carboxylic acids to peroxides is a crucial step in this strategy, allowing the subsequent C&#8722;O bond formation via Hock rearrangement.

         <title>Fortuitous Enantiomeric Self&#8208;Rectification of an Unreported Partial Racemisation in the Synthesis of a Chiral Phosphoric Acid: A Warning to Practitioners</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 72, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Research Article details a partial racemisation of a 3,3&#8217;&#8208;bis(phenanthrene) substituted BINOL during methoxymethyl (MOM) ether deprotection. Moreover, during phosphorylation of the (partially racemised) BINOL, it was found that a racemic intermediate phosphorochloridate precipitated, fortuitously reestablishing enantiopurity in the chiral phosphoric acid product.







Abstract
Racemisation without Consequence: MOM deprotection during a routine synthesis of phosphoric acid 1 promoted partial racemisation of the product BINOL 5. Surprisingly, however, after phosphorylation of the partially racemised BINOL, enantiopure acid 1 was isolated. Further inspection revealed that during phosphorylation, unhydrolysed racemic phosphorochloridate 6 precipitated, thus restoring homochirality in the product phosphoric acid 1. Moreover, MOM deprotection partial racemisation was avoided by conducting reactions at lower temperatures for no longer than the required deprotection time, and/or by application of other deprotection conditions from the literature.

The pro&#8208;aromatic terpene &#947;&#8208;terpinene &#8208; present as minor component in essential oils &#8208; shows antioxidant activity in micelles and liposomes, and protects cells from ferroptosis, by an unprecedented &#8220;slingshot&#8221; mechanism, due to its ability to react with radicals in the lipidic region forming, after fragmentation and aromatization, the HOO&#8901; radical that escapes from the membrane blocking the radical chain.

Ferroptosis is a cell death mechanism based on extensive cellular membrane peroxidation, implicated in neurodegenerative and other diseases. The essential oil component &#947;&#8208;terpinene, a natural monoterpene with a unique highly oxidizable pro&#8208;aromatic 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene skeleton, inhibits peroxidation of polyunsaturated lipid in model heterogeneous systems (micelles and liposomes). Upon H&#8208;atom abstraction, an unstable &#947;&#8208;terpinene&#8208;derived peroxyl radical is formed, that aromatizes to p&#8208;cymene generating HOO&#8901; radicals. As HOO&#8901; are small and hydrophilic radicals, they quickly diffuse outside the lipid core, blocking the radical chain propagation of polyunsaturated lipids. This unprecedented antioxidant &#8220;slingshot&#8221; mechanism explains why &#947;&#8208;terpinene shows a protective activity against ferroptosis, being effective at submicromolar concentrations in human neuroblastoma (SH&#8208;SY5Y) cells.

         <title>Photochemistry with Plane&#8208;Polarized Light: Controlling Selectivity of a Photochemical Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 72, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unidirectional alignment of photoreactive compounds in the nematic liquid crystal solutions enables controlling their photochemistry upon irradiation with the plane&#8208;polarized light. In this work, we demonstrate control over the preferential aryl group migration in the photochemical type B enone rearrangement. This approach provides a novel tool to direct photochemical reactivity and attenuate selectivity of the photochemical reactions.







Abstract
Over the past 50&#8197;years, a principal approach to controlling conventional photochemical reactions has relied on imposing geometric constraints on reactant or transition state via conducting photochemistry in the organized or constraining media. Herein, we describe a fundamentally different approach to affect the course of photochemical reactions (photochemical rearrangements) by utilizing spatially selective excitation of specific electronic transitions with plane&#8208;polarized light in the reactant molecules uniformly aligned in the nematic liquid crystal phase. In particular, we focused on the Type B enone rearrangement of 4,4&#8208;diarylcyclohexenones &#8211; one of the most common photochemical rearrangements. We demonstrated that the aryl migratory aptitude in this reaction was attenuated in response to changing an angle between the polarization plane of the incident light and the alignment direction of the nematic liquid crystal, with the enhanced aryl migration achieved when the polarization plane coincided with the transition dipole moment leading to the excited state responsible for this migration. The spatially&#8208;selective initial excitation therefore was overruling the electronic factors responsible for the relative ratio of the two alternative photoproducts. The experimental findings were further supported by the results of a computational study. This work showcases a new fundamental paradigm in controlling photochemical reactivity and selectivity of photoreactions.

Abstract
Asymmetric synthesis of derivatives of spiro[indoline&#8208;3,4&#8208;pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]pyridines] were first developed through the organocatalytic cascade of Knoevenagel/Michael/cyclization reactions using a quinidine&#8208;derived squaramide. Under the optimized conditions, the three&#8208;component reactions of isatins, cyanoacetates, and 3&#8208;aminomaleimides yield the desired heterocycle&#8208;fused spirooxindoles in good yields (78&#8211;91&#8201;%) with 53&#8201;%&#8211;99&#8201;% enantiomeric excess (ee). Notably, this reaction enables a broad substrate scope under mild conditions and provides a convenient method for the enantioselective construction of diverse spirooxindoles combined with dihydropyridine and maleimide skeletons, which has great potential for the construction of new bioactive chemical entities.

The palladium trimer functionalized polymers PSSy&#8208;[Pd3]+ (2) and their derived palladium nanoparticles (3) are synthesized by concise free radical polymerization method. They show much superior catalytic activities than their monomeric precursors in the SMCC and 4&#8208;nitrophenol reduction reactions. This work enlightens that the immobilization of tri&#8208;palladium clusters or nanoparticles by polymerization could offer multiple advantages in stability, efficiency and recyclability.







Abstract
The development of heterogeneous palladium catalysts has shown continuous vitality in the field of catalysis and materials. In this work, we report one concise free radical polymerization approach to accomplish the aromatic palladium trimer functionalized polymers PSSy&#8208;[Pd3]+ (2) and its derived palladium nanoparticles (3). Full characterizations could confirm the successful combination of cationic [Pd3]+ or nanoparticles with poly(p&#8208;sulfonated styrene) skeleton. Compared to their monomeric tri&#8208;palladium precursor (1) and common Pd(dba)2, Pd(PPh3)4, Pd(OAc)2, heterogeneous PSSy&#8208;[Pd3]+ (2) shows much superior catalytic activities (0.15&#8197;mol&#8201;%, TOF=1333.3&#8197;h&#8722;1) in the SMCC reaction. The identically ligated PdNPs (3) are formed in&#8208;suit in the presence of NaBH4 and accomplish quantitative reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol in just 320&#8197;s (0.50&#8197;mol&#8201;%, TOF=2250&#8197;h&#8722;1). Moreover, these heterogeneous catalysts are reused for 5&#8211;6 times without significant loss of catalytic activity. Their superior catalytic ability is probably attributed to the synergistic effect of polymer entanglement and the tri&#8208;palladium fragment. This work enlightens that the immobilization of palladium clusters or nanoparticles by polymerization could offer multiple advantages in stability, efficiency and recyclability for their involved catalyses and show far&#8208;reaching future implications.

         <title>Gallatabenzene Ligands Emerging from Open Lutetocene and Yttrocene Methyl Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 72, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully open metallocene (2,4&#8208;dtbp)2LuMe (I) is isolable and stable only at low temperatures and features a superbasic vital intermediate for subsequent ring&#8208;closure reactions. So accessible bis(gallatabenzene) complexes (1&#8208;Me&#8208;3,5&#8208;tBu2&#8208;C5H3Ga)(&#956;&#8208;Me)Ln(1&#8208;Me&#8208;3,5&#8208;tBu2&#8208;C5H3Ga) (Ln=Y, Lu (II)) exhibit almost planar metallacycles, while the respective aluminatabenzene chemistry follows distinct reaction pathways.







Abstract
Utilizing ternary mixtures [LnMe3]n/K(2,4&#8208;dtbp)/GaMe3 (Ln=Lu, Y; 2,4&#8208;dtbp=2,4&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;pentadienyl), a series of metallacycles is accessible via tandem salt metathesis/deprotonation.

&lt;p&gt;Fully open metallocene (2,4-dtbp)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;LuMe (I) is isolable and stable only at low temperatures and features a superbasic vital intermediate for subsequent ring-closure reactions.

Abstract
Incorporation of a thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene into an isophlorinoid&#8208;like framework alters the aromaticity by extending the macrocyclic &#960;&#8208;circuit. Their opto&#8208;electronic and aromatic properties significantly differ from other 22&#960; and 34&#960; porphyrinoids. Among the three different 34&#960; hexaphyrins, furan based hexaphyrin adopts a non&#8208;aromatic &#8216;figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight&#8217; conformation. Replacing all the furans either by thiophene or selenophene induces a planar conformation with aromatic characteristics. Spectro&#8208;electrochemical studies revealed reversible two&#8208;electron ring oxidation to yield their 4n&#960; dicationic species respectively.

         <title>Highly Luminescent Aceno[6]helicenones by Intramolecular Radical Cyclization</title>

Carbo[n]helicenes are poor emitters with the emission peak in purple or blue region. Inserting a carbonyl group into the skeleton shifts the emission to longer wavelengths and greatly improves the fluorescence quantum yield. The color can be tuned by shifting the position of the carbonyl.







Abstract
Helicenes and helicenoid structures are promising candidates for future applications exploiting circularly polarized light. Ideal candidates should possess near&#8208;quantitative photoluminescence quantum yield, a high luminescence dissymmetry factor and an adjustable HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. However, carbo[n]helicenes are poorly luminescent compounds and they absorb light mainly in the ultraviolet region. Here we show that the incorporation of a carbonyl group into helical scaffold significantly improves the fluorescence quantum yield and shifts the absorption to visible region. Although the carbonyl group is commonly considered as detrimental to efficient emission, fluorescence quantum yields up to &#934;=0.43 were recorded. A straightforward synthetic approach to a highly luminescent tetraceno[6]helicenone and an aza analogue has been developed. The key step is a radical cyclization which is achieving dehydrative &#960;&#8208;extension. The aza&#8208;analogue was incorporated as an emitter in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and showed good performance.

         <title>Chiral Induction of a Tetrakis(porphyrin) in Various Chiral Solvents</title>

Urethane&#8208;equipped tetrakis(porphyrin) is CD&#8208;active in many chiral solvents, which demonstrates the potential benefits of supramolecular interactions for developing chiral sensory systems.







Abstract
Non&#8208;covalent interactions offer an alternative way for developing stimulus&#8208;responsive materials such as sensors, machines, and drug&#8208;delivery systems. We recently reported that a urethane&#8208;equipped tetrakis(porphyrin) forms one&#8208;handed helical supramolecular polymers in solution in response to chirality of chiral solvents. Conformational changes in helical sense were detected using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, which showed that the tetrakis(porphyrin) can possibly be used as a sensor for determining the enantiomeric excess of a chiral analyte. Hence, we studied the scope and limitations of the chiral&#8208;induction behavior of tetrakis(porphyrin) to deepen the understanding of tetrakis(porphyrin)&#8208;based chiral sensing systems. Herein, we report the chiral&#8208;induction behavior of tetrakis(porphyrin) in various chiral solvents, which was found to be CD&#8208;active in many chiral solvents. Notably, the tetrakis(porphyrin) was CD active in a cryptochiral molecular solvent, which is exciting because the chiralities of acyclic saturated hydrocarbons are hard to sense. Consequently, this study highlights the potential advantages of supramolecular chiral sensors capable of targeting a wide range of analytes, including molecules that are absorption&#8208;silent in the UV/vis region, ones devoid of anchoring functional groups, and acyclic, saturated hydrocarbons.

         <title>Anisotropic Porosity and Interface Synergy Enhanced Gas Permselectivity in Heterolayer Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membrane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 72, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anisotropic heterolayer metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) membrane, composed of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 and ZIF&#8208;8, is synthesized using a sequential growth strategy. The membrane's pore anisotropy (ranging from 3.4 to 6&#8197;&#197;) and a distinct MOF&#8208;MOF interface with chemically crosslinked pores demonstrate enhanced CO2/N2 permselectivity compared to the performance of individual MOF membranes.







Abstract
The pursuit of sustainable, carbon&#8208;free separation technology hinges on the efficient separation of gas mixtures with high separation factors and flow rates, i.&#8201;e. high permselectivity. However, achieving this objective is arduous due to the meticulous engineering at the angstrom scale and intricate chemical manipulation required to design the pores within membranes. To address this challenge, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for an anisotropic porous membrane has been devised. Employing a meticulous step&#8208;by&#8208;step methodology, two distinct porous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are integrated to form a monolithic anisotropic membrane. By harnessing pore anisotropy (3.4 to 6&#8197;&#197;) aligned with the gas permeation direction and a unique interface characterized by cross&#8208;linked pores derived from the two distinct MOFs, this membrane transcends the performance limitations inherent in the individual MOF membranes (~45&#8201;% enhanced selectivity). This approach not only sheds light on the heterolayer membrane design strategy but also elucidates the intricate CO2/N2 permselectivity relationship inherent in the interface structure.

         <title>Mechano&#8208;Responsive Fluorescent Gel based on Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Crosslinked Dynamic Covalent Network</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 72, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechano&#8208;responsive fluorescent gel was developed using tetraphenylethylene as a cross&#8208;linker, resulting in a dynamic covalent network that exhibited enhanced fluorescence under tensile stress. During the stress relaxation, the fluorescence intensity also decreased due to the exchange of dynamic covalent bonds.







Abstract
The rapid development of mechano&#8208;responsive fluorescence has been driven by its promising applications in the fields of sensors, information encryption, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. However, designing mechanophores that can exhibit fluorescence changes under relatively low force remains challenging. In this study, a mechano&#8208;responsive fluorescent gel was developed using a tetraphenylethylene derivative as a cross&#8208;linker, producing a dynamic covalent network that exhibits increased fluorescence under tensile stress. Based on controlled experimental studies and molecular modeling calculations, the fluorescence enhancement by external forces was attributed to the restriction of intramolecular motion in tetraphenylethylene by macromolecular chain orientation. In time&#8208;dependent experiments, due to the exchange of dynamic covalent bonds, the stress relaxation and the decrease in fluorescence intensity of the gel at fixed strain occurred simultaneously, demonstrating the potential of this fluorescence as an indication of internal stress through aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) type mechanophore.

         <title>Triscyanocorrole, the Newest and Most Intriguing Member of the C1&#8208;Substituted Corrole Family</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 72, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare CF3/CN conversion is reported as a facile synthetic approach towards 5,10,15&#8208;triscyanocorrole, whose gallium, phosphorus, and cobalt complexes were fully characterized. The meso&#8208;nitrile groups strongly affect photophysical properties, redox potentials and coordination chemistry. Light absorption and emission take place at longer wavelengths and the excited state lifetimes are larger, reduction of both the corrole macrocycle and metals chelated by it becomes easier, and the relative orientation of axial pyridine ligands is perpendicular rather than parallel.







Abstract
Considering the potential advantages of minimally sized corroles for diverse applications, this study reports a facile access to cyano&#8208;substituted derivatives via a rare CF3/CN conversion. Investigation of the fully characterized gallium, phosphorus, and cobalt complexes discloses multiple effects of the meso&#8208;nitrile groups attached to the macrocycle. This corrole appears to be the most electron poor derivative which comes into play in the redox potentials of the corresponding complexes. Compared to its precursor, both the absorption and emission are strongly red shifted and the fluorescence lifetime and quantum yield are much larger. The coordination chemistry is affected as well, by virtue of axial ligands being perpendicular rather than parallel relative to each other.

         <title>Formulation and Release of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Using a Supramolecular Self&#8208;Healing Two&#8208;Component Gel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 72, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator (LMWG) was formulated with a variety of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) &#8208; APIs must be carefully chosen to optimise formulation and release. The thixotropic atropine&#8208;loaded gel controlled the release of atropine over a period of hours, suggesting supramolecular gels have promise as a potential approach for treating myopia.







Abstract
A two&#8208;component low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator (LMWG) formed from a modified amino acid and an aldehyde was formulated with active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Basic APIs (propranolol, atropine) can be mixed with the LMWG prior to gel assembly while acidic APIs (naproxen, rosuvastatin) inhibit assembly by disrupting the LMWG imine bond and were loaded by diffusion after gel assembly. For diffusion&#8208;loaded gels, the API in the liquid&#8208;like phase was rapidly released, with the remainder, interacting with gel fibres, retained in the gel. Rosuvastatin release was particularly low with Saturation Transfer Difference (STD) NMR indicating interactions between the aromatic ring and the self&#8208;assembled gel network. Propranolol also interacted with the gel via its aromatic unit, and its release led to gel erosion. Using agarose as a polymer gelator additive reinforced the gel, restricting erosion. In contrast, atropine was readily released over a period of hours &#8208; it is primarily in the liquid&#8208;like phase with STD NMR indicating no interactions with the gel network. The atropine&#8208;loaded gel retained its thixotropic properties. Overall, APIs must be carefully chosen to optimise formulation/release. Of the APIs investigated, atropine has most potential for further development. Atropine has applications in treating myopia, and our results suggest potential ophthalmic applications of supramolecular gels.

&lt;p&gt;A low-molecular-weight gelator (LMWG) was formulated with a variety of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) - APIs must be carefully chosen to optimise formulation and release. The thixotropic atropine-loaded gel controlled the release of atropine over a period of hours, suggesting supramolecular gels have promise as a potential approach for treating myopia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A two-component low-molecular-weight gelator (LMWG) formed from a modified amino acid and an aldehyde was formulated with active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Basic APIs (propranolol, atropine) can be mixed with the LMWG prior to gel assembly while acidic APIs (naproxen, rosuvastatin) inhibit assembly by disrupting the LMWG imine bond and were loaded by diffusion after gel assembly. For diffusion-loaded gels, the API in the liquid-like phase was rapidly released, with the remainder, interacting with gel fibres, retained in the gel. Rosuvastatin release was particularly low with Saturation Transfer Difference (STD) NMR indicating interactions between the aromatic ring and the self-assembled gel network. Propranolol also interacted with the gel via its aromatic unit, and its release led to gel erosion. Using agarose as a polymer gelator additive reinforced the gel, restricting erosion. In contrast, atropine was readily released over a period of hours - it is primarily in the liquid-like phase with STD NMR indicating no interactions with the gel network. The atropine-loaded gel retained its thixotropic properties. Overall, APIs must be carefully chosen to optimise formulation/release. Of the APIs investigated, atropine has most potential for further development. Atropine has applications in treating myopia, and our results suggest potential ophthalmic applications of supramolecular gels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Designing Artificial Laccase Catalysts by Introducing Substrate Oxidation Metals into Oxygen&#8208;Reducing Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Cu&#8208;Doped ZIF&#8208;67</title>

This study presents the development of copper&#8208;doped zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 (Cu&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67) as an artificial laccase catalyst. Cu&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67 exhibits enhanced catalytic performance and thermal stability compared to natural laccase, providing an efficient and reusable solution for industrial applications. The dual&#8208;site mechanism, where copper facilitates phenol oxidation and cobalt&#8208;based ZIF&#8208;67 supports oxygen reduction, is thoroughly explored.







Abstract
Laccase, a multi&#8208;copper oxidase, is limited by its optimal temperature range and isolation costs. To overcome these challenges, we synthesized copper&#8208;doped zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 (Cu&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67) with 16&#8197;mol&#8201;% Cu as an artificial laccase catalyst. The introduced Cu site acts as the phenol oxidation site, and Co&#8208;based ZIF&#8208;67 is the four&#8208;electron oxygen reduction site. Laccase also employs this division of oxidation and reduction sites. Cu&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67 demonstrated significant catalytic activity, superior to natural laccase, especially at elevated temperatures, and maintained stability across multiple reaction cycles. These findings suggest that Cu&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67 is a robust, reusable alternative for industrial applications requiring high thermal stability and efficient catalysis.

         <title>Copper(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective H/D Exchange Based on Reversible C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 72, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for Cu&#8208;catalyzed H/D exchange was developed based on the mechanistic framework of reversible concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation. This process, which typically follows disproportionation of Cu(II) to Cu(III) in the functionalizations, was hindered by the presence of picolinic acid. This inhibition enabled the inverse reconstruction of C&#8722;D bond using heavy water as deuterium source, with a catalytic loading of copper species.







Abstract
Despite the increasing use of copper in C&#8722;H functionalizations, the Cu&#8208;catalyzed direct deuteration of C&#8722;H bonds remains a significant challenge due to its inherent low reactivity in inverse C&#8722;H bond reconstruction. In this paper, a novel strategy had been developed to reverse the copper&#8208;catalyzed concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation process by inhibiting the unexpected disproportionation of Cu(II) to Cu(III). Picolinic acid was identified as a powerful ligand for facilitating this H/D exchange with D2O as deuterium source, and its inhibition activity was supported by preliminary control experiments and DFT studies.

         <title>3,3&#8208;Difluorooxetane&#8211;A Versatile Functional Group for Bioisosteric Replacements in Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 72, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
3,3&#8208;Difluorooxetane (3,3&#8208;diFOx) is proposed as a promising functional group for drug discovery and other areas of science. Its applicability is confirmed by a comprehensive study of physicochemical, structural, electronic, and biological properties, assessing chemical stability, as well as multigram synthesis of corresponding building blocks. The compatibility with bioisosteric replacements is demonstrated for the case of tert&#8208;butyl group in the molecule of Tenovin&#8208;6, a known sirtuin inhibitor.







Abstract
Functional group (FG) is one of the cornerstone concepts in organic chemistry and related areas. The wide spread of bioisosterism ideas in medicinal chemistry and beyond caused a striking rise in demand for novel FGs with a defined impact on the developed compound properties. In this work, the evaluation of the 3,3&#8208;difluorooxetane unit (3,3&#8208;diFox) as a functional group for bioisosteric replacements is disclosed. A comprehensive experimental study (including multigram building block synthesis, quantification of steric and electronic properties, measurements of pKa, LogP, chemical stability, and biological evaluation of the 3,3&#8208;diFox&#8208;derived bioisostere of a drug candidate) revealed a prominent behavior of the 3,3&#8208;diFox fragment as a versatile substituent for early drug discovery programs.

A convenient synthesis of planar chiral [2.2]paracyclophane imidazoline N,O&#8208;ligands has been developed. The application of these classes of ligands showed excellent performance in organozinc additions to aldehydes. An improved seven&#8208;step synthesis of [2.2]paracyclophane&#8208;imidazoline N,O&#8208;ligands (UCD&#8208;Imphanols) possessing both central and planar chirality is presented. These ligands are applied in organozinc additions to aldehydes, achieving enantioselectivities of up to 97&#8201;% ee in ethylation and 95&#8201;% ee (R) and 82&#8201;% ee (S) in arylation using (S,S,SP)&#8208; and (S,S,RP)&#8208;UCD&#8208;Imphanols, respectively.







Abstract
We present an improved and convenient synthesis of [2.2]paracyclophane&#8208;imidazoline N,O&#8208;ligands with central and planar chirality in seven steps starting from [2.2]paracyclophane.

The asymmetric ethylation of aldehydes proceeded with enantioselectivities of up to 97&#8201;% ee, while the asymmetric arylation of aldehydes gave up to 95&#8201;% ee (R) and 82&#8201;% ee (S) using (S,S,SP)&#8208;UCD&#8208;Imphanol and (S,S,RP)&#8208;UCD&#8208;Imphanol, respectively.

The Front Cover shows 3,3&#8208;difluoroxetane (3,3&#8208;diFOx)&#8212;a valuable functional group for bioisosteric replacements in drug discovery. The physicochemical, structural, and biological properties of this very interesting fragment were mainly caused by the synergistic effect of the gem&#8208;difluorinated (3,3&#8208;diF) and oxetane (Ox) moieties. Both of these &#8220;foxes&#8221; are shown as heteroatom&#8208;colored constellations, along with the X&#8208;ray&#8208;derived structure of the 3,3&#8208;difluoroxetane unit as an important part of the described study. More information can be found in the Research Article by O.&#8197;O. Grygorenko and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403277).

The Cover Feature illustrates a bioinspired metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) that mimics the function of laccase, an enzyme involved in the hardening of traditional Japanese lacquerware. Laccase is a multicopper oxidase containing a trinuclear copper cluster responsible for oxygen reduction and a mononuclear site that oxidizes phenolic substrates, linking these reactions to achieve catalytic function. Inspired by this mechanism, we developed a MOF incorporating cobalt ions for oxygen reduction and copper ions as active sites for phenolic oxidation. This design highlights the potential of bioinspired approaches in creating artificial enzymes with complex catalytic functionalities. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Nakahara and Y. Hitomi (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202402953).

         <title>Cover Feature: Role of Active Centers in Predicting the Catalyst Turnover: A Theoretical Study (Chem. Eur. J. 72/2024)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 72, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of active centers in predicting the turnover for molecular water&#8208;oxidation catalysts has been analyzed. To achieve this goal, we chose three [M(OTf)2(Me2Pytacn)] complexes with manganese (Mn), cobalt (Co), and nickel (Ni) active centers that help to cross the energy barrier necessary for the water oxidation reaction. Our computed result indicates that the [Co(OTf)2(Me2Pytacn)] complex shows the highest efficiency, indicating a suitable alternative for water oxidation reaction.

         <dc:description>
Protein lipoxidation, a kind of protein post&#8208;translational modification mainly produced under cellular oxidative stress, plays a significant regulatory role in the structure and function of protein. This review describes the source and pathophysiological effects of protein lipoxidation, highlights developments and applications of the detection strategies especially MS&#8208;based chemoproteomic technologies of LDE&#8208;protein adducts and discusses challenges in this field.







Abstract
Lipid peroxidation, occurring through enzymatic or non&#8208;enzymatic processes, generates lipid&#8208;derived electrophiles (LDEs), which can covalently modify nucleophilic amino acid residues in proteins, a process known as protein lipoxidation. This modification can alter protein structure and function, either causing damage or regulating signalling pathways. Identifying the protein targets and specific lipoxidation sites provide important clues for unveiling the oxidative stress&#8208;related protein interaction network and molecular mechanisms of related diseases. In this review, we present a detailed overview of recent advances in protein LDE modification profiling, with a focus on mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based chemoproteomic platforms for global protein lipoxidation profiling.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Polymerized Solid/Quasi&#8208;Solid Polymer Electrolyte for Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries: Recent Progress and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 72, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ polymerization can achieve good interfacial contact between polymer electrolytes and electrodes, which can significantly reduce the interfacial resistance. This review summarized the latest in&#8197;situ polymerization strategies of polymer electrolytes for lithium metal batteries, including thermally induced polymerization, chemical initiator polymerization, ionizing radiation polymerization, and concluded the major challenges and future trends of in&#8208;situ polymerized electrolytes for LMBs.







Abstract
In pursuit of high energy density, lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are undoubtedly the best choice. However, leakage and inevitable dendrite growth in liquid electrolytes seriously hinder its practical application. Solid/quasi&#8208;solid state electrolytes have emerged as an answer to solve the above issues. Especially, polymer electrolytes with excellent interface compatibility, high flexibility, and ease of machining have become a research hotspot for LMBs.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In situ&lt;/i&gt; polymerization can achieve good interfacial contact between polymer electrolytes and electrodes, which can significantly reduce the interfacial resistance. This review summarized the latest in&#8197;situ polymerization strategies of polymer electrolytes for lithium metal batteries, including thermally induced polymerization, chemical initiator polymerization, ionizing radiation polymerization, and concluded the major challenges and future trends of in-situ polymerized electrolytes for LMBs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In pursuit of high energy density, lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are undoubtedly the best choice. However, leakage and inevitable dendrite growth in liquid electrolytes seriously hinder its practical application. Solid/quasi-solid state electrolytes have emerged as an answer to solve the above issues. Especially, polymer electrolytes with excellent interface compatibility, high flexibility, and ease of machining have become a research hotspot for LMBs. Nevertheless, the interface contact between polymer electrolyte and inorganic electrode materials and the low ionic conductivity restrict its development. On account of these, in&#8197;situ polymerized polymer electrolyte is proposed. Polymer solid electrolytes produced through in&#8197;situ polymerization promote robust interface contact between the electrolyte and electrode while simplifying the preparation steps. This review summarized the latest research progress in in&#8197;situ polymerized solid electrolytes for LMBs. These electrolytes were divided into three parts according to their polymerization methods: thermally induced polymerization, chemical initiator polymerization, ionizing radiation polymerization, and so on. Furthermore, we concluded the major challenges and future trends of in&#8197;situ polymerized solid electrolytes for LMBs. It's hoped that this review will provide meaningful guidance on designing high-performance polymer solid electrolytes for LMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Decarboxylative Fluorination of b&#8208;Keto Acids in Aqueous Media: 19F&#8208;NMR&#8208;Assisted Batch Optimization and Transfer to Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective decarboxylative fluorination of 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;3&#8208;phenylpropionic acid is used as a benchmark reaction to optimize it under biocompatible conditions in batch and to transfer it to continuous flow mode. The reaction conditions are varied with respect to temperature, fluorinating reagents, inorganic base additives, and pH, as these parameters have been identified as having a significant impact on the process. The formation of the products and any by&#8208;products is analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) and 19F nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). Once optimal conditions have been determined, the reaction is carried out using an automated continuous laboratory synthesis system that features a mesostructured capillary reactor and an integrated 19F&#8208;NMR spectrometer for real&#8208;time monitoring of the reaction. The work presented here represents the initial phase of a multi&#8208;step continuous flow process that will include additional biocatalyzed downstream reactions in future applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Duplex Stability of DNA Oligonucleotides Containing Metal&#8208;Mediated Base Pairs of Imidazole&#8208;Derived Nucleobases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two artificial imidazole&#8208;derived nucleobases, HQIm (3H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;f]quinolin&#8208;5&#8208;ol) and CaIm (imidazole&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate), were introduced into short DNA duplexes to systematically investigate their thermal stability upon metal ion coordination. Metal&#8208;mediated base pairs are formed with the 3d metal ions CoII, NiII and ZnII, as well as with the lanthanoid ions EuIII and SmIII, which induce a thermal stabilization of up to 8 &#176;C upon binding. The latter are the first lanthanoid&#8208;mediated base pairs involving only four donor atoms that result in a significant duplex stabilization. For the 3d metal ions, the increase in DNA melting temperature is in agreement with the trend in complex stability according to the Irving&#8208;Williams series. The duplex stabilization upon metal&#8208;mediated base pair formation depends on the identity of the artificial base pair, enabling discrimination between metal ions by systematic design of the duplex. Further, the influence of pH on the stability of selected duplexes was studied, revealing a linear relation between pH and the formation of HQIm&#8211;NiII&#8211;HQIm base pairs and allowing to induce a distinct stabilization between 1 &#176;C and 28 &#176;C. Regarding EuIII&#8208;mediated base pairs, an acidic pH can be utilized to disturb their formation, presumably by promoting the coordination of EuIII to the DNA backbone.</dc:description>

         <title>Addition and Oxidation Reactivity of a Pentacoordinate Nickelacyclobutane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nickelacyclobutanes are reactive intermediates in catalytic cycles involving cyclopropanation and insertion reactions. The stoichiometric study of these intermediates has shown that their reactivity is highly influenced by the coordination environment of the nickel center. A pentacoordinated nickelacyclobutane embedded in a diphosphine pincer ligand has been shown to selectively undergo various reactions with exogenous ligands, including [2+2] cycloreversion and carbene transfer to an isocyanide. Herein, we investigate the reactivity of the pentacoordinated nickelacyclobutane towards addition and oxidation reactions. Addition reactions lead to ring&#8208;opening to form stable square planar Ni(II) compounds, while metal oxidation enhances [2+2] cycloreversion. DFT calculations are used to shed light on the different mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The supramolecular resorcinarene hexameric capsule efficiently promotes the unprecedented reaction between isocyanides and electron&#8208;deficient aromatic aldehydes leading to the formation of imines and carbon monoxide. The mechanism of the reaction was investigated via isotope labelling, kinetic analysis of the reaction, computational studies and the independent synthesis of a proposed intermediate. Control experiments indicate that the formation of the key aziridinone intermediate is limited to the cavity of the capsule.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Symmetrical and Asymmetrical Polyferrocenylmethylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of differently substituted polyferrocenylmethylenes (PFM) via ring&#8208;opening transmetalation polymerization (ROTP) is reported. A number of novel, symmetrically and asymmetrically substituted carba[1]magnesocenophanes have been prepared, which were used as precursors and allowed investigations of the influence of different substitution patterns on the PFM polymer properties. The novel carba[1]magnesocenophanes have been fully characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, and structurally authenticated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD). The corresponding PFMs were obtained with molecular weights in a range of Mw = 1900 g mol&#8208;1 up to 15100 g mol&#8208;1 and corresponding dispersities of &#272; = 1.48 to 1.81. All PFMs have been fully characterized by 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopy, as well as by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization&#8208;time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (MALDI&#8208;ToF) mass spectrometry. Pyrolysis of spyrocyclic substituted PFM resulted in a ceramic yield above 50%, while the obtained residue was characterized by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD).</dc:description>

         <title>Block Architectures in 2D Polymer Networks Fabricated via Sequential Copolymerization in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polymer network monolayers with novel block architectures were fabricated via sequential copolymerization within a pillared&#8208;layer metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) that served as the reaction template. The MOF provides a confined 2D nanospace, restricting the crosslinking copolymerization of vinyl monomers to two dimensions. Sequential crosslinking copolymerization of methyl methacrylate and styrene, regulated by the reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) process, resulted in the formation of 2D block architectures with &#8216;patchy&#8217; domains consisting of crosslinked poly(methyl methacrylate) and polystyrene segments. Atomic force microscopy revealed that the resulting block monolayers exhibited varied morphologies on substrates, attributed to their intrinsic flexibility in 2D conformation, which facilitated microphase separation of the 2D segments within monolayers, leading to the unique aggregation morphologies. The unprecedented block topology in 2D polymeric monolayers presented in this study introduces a novel strategy for designing 2D polymeric nanomaterials with flexible yet anisotropic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental Spin State Determination of Iron(II) Complexes by Hirshfeld Atom Refinement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we present the first experimental determination of the spin state of transition metal complexes by using Hirshfeld Atom Refinement. For the demonstration, the two iron(II) complexes, (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2*6H2O and [Fe(pic)3]Cl2*EtOH were investigated. The method involves the refinement using wavefunctions of different spin multiplicity and comparison against experimental diffraction data by means of refinement indicators and residual electron density. Our results show a clear distinction between high&#8208;spin and low&#8208;spin configurations, even for compounds with spin&#8208;crossover behavior. The presented work demonstrates the potential of Hirshfeld Atom Refinement for the experimental determination of spin states in transition metal complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>MOF derived cobalt ferrite cubic rod&#8208;like materials for highly efficient electrochemical simultaneous detection of multiple heavy metal ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of CoFe2O4&#160;materials derived from metal&#8208;organic framework&#160;were successfully constructed by the solvent&#8208;thermal method.&#160;The morphology of a typical sample&#160;CoFe2O4&#8208;1&#160;was mostly in the form of a cubic rod&#8208;like structure with a size distribution of&#160;3.2 &#177; 0.2 &#956;m, while a small amount of the structure presented hexagonal shape with uniform size dispersion.&#160;The XPS characterization results confirmed that the CoFe2O4&#8208;1 material contained Co3+&#160;(Co2+/Co3+&#160;= 0.98), and the redox reaction between Co2+&#160;and Fe3+&#160;produced more Fe2+&#160;(Fe2+/Fe3+&#160;= 1.63), leading to the production of more OV&#160;on the surface of the CoFe2O4&#8208;1 material (OV% = 0.34), thereby facilitating the efficient adsorption of the efficient adsorption of heavy metal ions&#160;(HMIs). CoFe2O4&#8208;1/GCE as a typical&#160;electrode presented excellent performance for the detection of multiple&#160;HMIs. The results&#160;should&#160;be&#160;attributed to the good electrical conductivity and large electrochemically active surface area of CoFe2O4&#8208;1/GCE, accelerating the transport of ions and charges in the system. Interestingly,&#160;there are&#160;interaction mechanisms&#160;between the HMIs when performing simultaneous detection,&#160;suggesting&#160;the detection of target ions can be facilitated by adding additional ions.&#160;This study provides new research insights for the development of highly sensitive electrochemical sensors for real&#8208;time environmental monitoring.</dc:description>

         <title>The Designs and Applications of Tetraphenylethylene Macrocycles and Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetraphenylethylene containing macrocycles and cages unite the aggregation&#8208;induced emission and supramolecular hosts into a single component, which makes them especially attractive functional molecules. With advanced synthesis strategies and self&#8208;assemblies, various complicated macrocycles and cages have been reported. Those unique compounds were attracting materials for sensing, imaging, catalysis, and many other applications.







Abstract
Macrocycles and cages are very attractive for the development of functional materials due to their unique inner cavities. Building blocks with interesting functions and synthetic conveniences are especially attractive. Tetraphenylethylene (TPE) is such an entity with C2 symmetry and tetrakis&#8208;functional groups easily modifiable. As a typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) active compound, TPE perfectly unites the functions of fluorescence and structural building blocks together. The unique marriage of the two roles into one component makes TPE an ideal platform for the development of functional molecular systems including macrocycles and cages. The TPE macrocycles and cages are not merely a simple combination of those two but also generate added values unseen in either component alone. The fluorescence properties of TPE in macrocycles/cages are greatly improved or modulated, which makes them more suitable for various applications compared to their linear counterparts. In this review, the chemistry and design principles of TPE macrocycles/cages are surveyed first. The unique properties of those compounds are also discussed to provide general guidance for their functionalization. A brief discussion of their applications focusing on the utilization of their unique fluorescence is also presented. In the last, outlooks and future perspectives of TPE macrocycles/cages are provided for further developments.

         <title>Pd/Cu Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylation for Stereodivergent Synthesis of Glutamic Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A branched, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective coupling of Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman carbonates and Schiff bases derived from simple amino acids has been developed via synergistic Pd/Cu catalysis. This protocol features high efficiency, mild conditions, and a broad substrate scope, providing a series of &#946;&#8208;branched glutamic acid derivatives with adjacent 3&#176;/3&#176; or 3&#176;/4&#176; stereocenters in high yields and excellent enantiomeric excess.







Abstract
A synergistic Pd/Cu catalyst system has been developed for stereodivergent transformation of Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) carbonates and Schiff bases derived from simple amino acids to afford a series of optically active &#946;&#8208;branched &#947;&#8208;methyleneglutamic acid derivatives with adjacent tertiary/tertiary and quaternary/tertiary stereocenters in high yields (up to 96&#8201;%) with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (&gt;20/1 dr and &gt;99&#8201;% ee in most cases) under mild conditions. The use of SKP ligand is disclosed to be crucial for the success of the transformation, and in particular allowing the reaction to proceed at low catalyst loading (0.02&#8197;mol&#8201;% for Pd and 0.08&#8197;mol&#8201;% for Cu). The high efficiency of the catalysis was attributed to the formation of intimate ion pair complex A1, composed of Pd&#8208;phosphonium cation and a t&#8208;butoxide anion, which would facilitate the subsequent deprotonation and C&#8722;C coupling events. All four stereoisomers of the &#946;&#8208;branched glutamic acid derivatives were readily prepared by permutation of the catalyst enantiomers. Synthetic utility of the methodology was exemplified by efficient synthesis of a fused pyrrolooxazolidinone with three contiguous chiral centers, highlighting the power of synergistic Pd/Cu catalysis for asymmetric allylic alkylation with MBH carbonates.

         <title>Sulfonatocalix[4]arene&#8208;Based Scavengers for V&#8208;Type Nerve Agents with Enhanced Detoxification Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two is better than one. The introduction of a second hydroxamic acid substituents along the cavity of a sulfonatocalix[4]arene improves the activity with which this compound detoxifies highly toxic nerve agents of the V&#8208;type to such an extent that its use as an antidote is now conceivable.







Abstract
Synthetic small molecule scavengers that rapidly detoxify nerve agents in&#8197;vivo allow (pre)treatment of nerve agent poisoning. However, scavengers that detoxify persistent V&#8208;type nerve agents at pH&#8197;7.4 and 37&#8201;&#176;C with sufficient efficiency are still unknown. The most promising compound to date is a monosubstituted sulfonatocalix[4]arene containing a hydroxamic acid group. This compound was used to investigate the effect of structural modifications on detoxification activity. While none of the monosubstituted calixarene derivatives considered in this context possessed higher activity than the parent compound, the disubstituted derivatives were very active, exhibiting half&#8208;lives of detoxification under the conditions of an established in&#8197;vitro assay of &lt;1.5&#8197;min. The rate of detoxification decreased with decreasing scavenger concentration, but even at a fourfold molar excess of the scavenger, complete detoxification of 2.5&#8197;&#956;M solutions of some nerve agents could be achieved within one hour. These disubstituted calixarene derivatives thus bring synthetic scavengers for V&#8208;type nerve agents closer to application.

         <title>Sulfur and Oxygen Transfer Reactions with Simultaneous NHC&#8208;Coordination from Cyclic Thioureas and Ureas to a Stable Silylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur and oxygen transfer reactions of cyclic thioureas and ureas to an isolable silylene were examined. The sulfur transfer of a cyclic thiourea to the silylene formed the corresponding Si=S species. In the reaction of a cyclic urea, an oxygen transfer and the subsequent silyl migrations occurred to furnish a stable azomethine ylide.







Abstract
Reactions of cyclic thioureas (1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;thione and 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;thione) and ureas (1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;one and 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;one) with an isolable dialkylsilylene were examined. In these reactions, cyclic thioureas served as sulfur and NHC (N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) sources, and the corresponding silanethione and NHC&#8208;derived products formed via silanethione&#8208;NHC complexes. Reactions of cyclic ureas with the silylene afforded a new NHC and an isolable azomethine ylide. These reactions involved oxygen atom transfer and 1,3&#8208;silyl migrations, which were supported by computational studies.

         <title>Bioinspired Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Hunterine A: Deciphering the Key Step in the Biogenetic Pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise, bioinspired, and enantioselective synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;hunterine A, an unusual 6/7/6/6/5 pentacyclic natural compound, is reported through an aspidosperma precursor, employing a late&#8208;stage skeletal rearrangement. Our investigation delineates the potential mechanism and stereochemical elements governing the involved skeletal rearrangement, providing insight into the likely biosynthetic origin of (&#8722;)&#8208;hunterine A.







Abstract
A concise, bioinspired, and enantioselective synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;hunterine A, an odd 6/7/6/6/5 pentacyclic natural product, is described. The key step in the synthesis of this complex structure is an interim&#8208;template directed 6&#8208;exo selective epoxide ring&#8208;opening reaction, which is interwoven with a hydrolysis step of the indolenine hemiaminal template to create the unusual 7&#8208;membered azepine bridge motif. Our work not only refines the previously proposed biogenetic pathway, but also reveals the possible stereochemical prerequisite of the unique skeletal rearrangement, which provides a vantage point for understanding how (&#8722;)&#8208;hunterine A is likely to be generated in nature.

         <title>Active Site Engineering of a Glycerol Dehydrogenase Improves its Oxidative Activity and Scope Toward Glycerol Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regioselective oxidation of glyceryl alkyl ethers enables hydroxy ketone and enantiopure 1,2&#8208;diol synthesis. Engineering position 252 in GlyDH broadened substrate scope, with BsGlyDH&#8722;L252S emerging as a highly efficient biocatalyst for two&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot deracemization.







Abstract
Regioselective oxidation of glyceryl alkyl ethers is of utmost importance for the fabrication of substituted hydroxy ketones and enantiopure 1,2&#8208;diols as green solvents and pharmaceutical building blocks, respectively. An engineered glycerol dehydrogenase from Bacillus stearothermophilus was described to perform the regioselective oxidation of alkyl glycerol ethers, identifying position 252 as key for accepting larger substrates than glycerol. In this work, we further engineer that position through partial saturation mutagenesis to broaden the substrate scope toward other glycerol derivatives, improving enzyme kinetics and minimizing product inhibition. In particular, the BsGlyDH&#8722;L252S variant becomes the most efficient biocatalyst for the deracemization of alkyl glyceryl ethers in a two&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot immobilized system. The discovery and use of these alternative mutants of GlyDH opens the road to more applications and increases the enzymatic toolbox for the modifications of glyceryl ethers.

A highly efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective formal (3+3) and (3+2) cycloaddition reactions of isatin&#8208;derived tertiary propargylic esters with N,N&#8208;dimethylbarbituric acid and 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins, respectively has been realized. This approach facilitates the formation of optically active spirooxindole&#8208;pyran and furan scaffolds, each incorporating an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter, with high yields and excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective formal (3+3) and (3+2) cycloaddition reaction of isatin&#8208;derived tertiary propargylic esters with N,N&#8208;dimethylbarbituric acid and 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins, respectively. In this process, the tertiary propargylic ester serves as both C3&#8208; and C2&#8208;synthons, facilitating the synthesis of optically active spirooxindole&#8208;pyran and furan scaffolds featuring an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter. The reaction delivers these spirocyclic frameworks in good yields with high enantioselectivities. Additionally, the scalability of both the reactions and the transformation of chiral intermediates into valuable structures emphasize the synthetic and practical importance of this strategy.

         <title>Engineering Metal&#8208;MOF Interfaces for Selective CO&#8322; Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering metal&#8208;MOF interfaces unlocks new potential for selective CO&#8322; hydrogenation to methanol. Leveraging tunable structures, high surface areas, and strong metal&#8208;support interactions, MOF&#8208;based catalysts enhance methanol selectivity and stability. This paper explores Cu&#8722;Zn and Zn&#8722;Zr interfaces in MOFs, aiming to revolutionize methanol synthesis by improving active site dispersion and catalytic performance.







Abstract
The hydrogenation of CO&#8322; to methanol is a promising pathway toward sustainable fuel production and carbon recycling. A key factor in the efficiency of this process lies in the interaction between the metal catalyst and its support. Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as highly effective platforms due to their tunable structures, large surface areas, and ability to form stable interfaces with single&#8211;atom metals or metal nanoparticles. These metal&#8208;MOF interfaces are crucial for stabilizing active sites, preventing sintering, and enhancing catalytic performance. In this concept paper, we explore the role of these interfaces in promoting CO&#8322; hydrogenation, focusing on Cu&#8722;Zn, Cu&#8722;Zr, and Zn&#8722;Zr interfaces. The formation of strong interactions between metal sites and MOF nodes enables precise control over the dispersion and electronic environment of the active species, significantly improving methanol selectivity and long&#8208;term stability. By analyzing recent advancements in MOF&#8208;supported catalysts, this work highlights the concept of engineered metal&#8208;MOF interfaces to drive the development of next&#8208;generation catalysts for efficient methanol synthesis from CO&#8322;.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hydrogenation of CO&#8322; to methanol is a promising pathway toward sustainable fuel production and carbon recycling. A key factor in the efficiency of this process lies in the interaction between the metal catalyst and its support. Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as highly effective platforms due to their tunable structures, large surface areas, and ability to form stable interfaces with single&#8211;atom metals or metal nanoparticles. These metal-MOF interfaces are crucial for stabilizing active sites, preventing sintering, and enhancing catalytic performance. In this concept paper, we explore the role of these interfaces in promoting CO&#8322; hydrogenation, focusing on Cu&#8722;Zn, Cu&#8722;Zr, and Zn&#8722;Zr interfaces. The formation of strong interactions between metal sites and MOF nodes enables precise control over the dispersion and electronic environment of the active species, significantly improving methanol selectivity and long-term stability. By analyzing recent advancements in MOF-supported catalysts, this work highlights the concept of engineered metal-MOF interfaces to drive the development of next-generation catalysts for efficient methanol synthesis from CO&#8322;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Dual site borane capture into the Fe&#8722;N bonds of 1,3&#8208;N,S&#8208;chelated iron complex, [(dppe)Fe{&#954;2&#8208;N,S&#8208;(mp)}2], leads to isolation of a rare example of dimeric bis(dihydridoborate) complex, [Fe{k3&#8208;S,H,H&#8208;(H3B(mp))}2]2. This dinuclear complex exists as a pair of enantiomers, in which the iron centres are hepta&#8208;coordinated and comprise fourfold five&#8208;membered [Fe&#8722;B&#8722;NCS] heterocycles with k3&#8208;S,H,H coordination modes (see picture).







Abstract
In our effort to establish a direct synthetic approach for bis(dihydridoborate) complexes of first&#8208;row transition metals, we have investigated the reactivity of [Cp*Fe(dppe)Cl] (dppe =1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane) with Na[BH3L] (L =2&#8208;mercaptopyridine (mp) and 2&#8208;mercaptobenzothiazole (mbz)) that led to the formation of iron(II) dihydridoborate complexes, [Cp*Fe{&#954;3&#8208;S,H,H&#8208;(H2BH(L))}] 1&#8201;a&#8208;b (L=mp (1&#8201;a) and L=mbz (1&#8201;b)). Further, in an attempt to isolate the bis(dihydridoborate) complex of iron by the insertion of borane into the &#954;2&#8208;N,S&#8208;chelated iron complex, [(dppe)Fe{&#954;2&#8208;N,S&#8208;(mp)}2] (2), we have isolated and structurally characterized a rare example of dimeric iron bis(dihydridoborate) complex, [Fe{&#954;3&#8208;S,H,H&#8208;(H2BH(mp))}2]2, &#923;&#916;/&#916;&#923;&#8208;3 as pair of enantiomers. Interestingly, these enantiomers &#923;&#916;/&#916;&#923;&#8208;3 have two trans&#8208;[Fe{&#954;3&#8208;S,H,H&#8208;(H2BH(mp))}2] moieties bridged through sulfur atoms of 2&#8208;mercaptopyridinyl ligands, where the iron centres are hepta&#8208;coordinated. The natural bond&#8208;orbital (NBO) analyses of &#923;&#916;&#8208;3 and &#916;&#923;&#8208;3 show considerable electron donation from the filled &#963;B&#8208;H bonding orbital to vacant

         <title>Higher Assemblies of Coordination Cage&#8208;Catenanes Linked by Copper(II) Chloride Clusters: Networks and Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Serendipitous scavenging of chloride contaminant on reaction of Cu(NO3)2 with tris(nicotinoyl)cyclotriguaiacylene gives a tetramer of metal&#8208;organic cages bridged through {Cu4(&#956;&#8208;Cl)6Cl2(OH2)2} cluster into a dimer of cage&#8208;catenanes. Reaction with CuCl2 gives a similar motif but linked in a 2D polymer through further copper chloride bridging. Both materials show alteration of Cu(II) bridging on solvent&#8208;exchange.







Abstract
Cage&#8208;catenanes are chemical constructs where two or more cage&#8208;like molecules or assemblies are mechanically interlocked together. We report a new class of cage&#8208;catenanes where dimeric metal&#8208;organic cage&#8208;catenanes are linked into larger assemblies through additional bridging metal chloride links. These crystalline materials are obtained from the reaction of tris(nicotinoyl)cyclotriguaiacylene (L1) with Cu(II) salts, and all feature a tetramer of cages where two {Cu3(L1)2(X)6} cages (X=anion) are mechanically interlocked, and link to each other and to another {Cu3(L1)2(X)6}2 cage&#8208;catenane through a planar, linear tetranuclear {Cu4(&#956;&#8208;Cl)6Cl2} cluster. The complex of discrete tetrameric {Cu3(L1)2(X)6}4 assemblies (dimers of cage&#8208;catenanes) transforms through solvent&#8208;exchange processes to 1D coordination chain structures through additional {Cu2(&#956;&#8208;Cl)2} bridges between the tetrameric {Cu3(L1)2(X)6}4 assemblies. Complex [Cu6(L1)4Cl12(H2O)3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(H2O)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;15(DMF) C2 features a 2D coordination network of 63 topology linked through three different Cu(II) clusters, namely {Cu4(&#956;&#8208;Cl)6}, {Cu2(&#956;&#8208;Cl)2} and a rare linear {Cu2(&#956;&#8208;Cl)} linkage. Break&#8208;down of C2 in water likely proceeds through hydrolysis of this unusual linear Cu&#8208;Cl&#8208;Cl bond.

         <title>Nickel/Photoredox Catalyzed Aryl&#8208;Alkyl Cross&#8208;Coupling with Alkyl Boronic Esters as Radical Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We disclosed that activation of alkyl boronic esters by MeOLi is highly efficient for the generation of alkyl radicals under photocatalysis conditions. This strategy was successfully applied to nickel/photoredox dual&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) coupling of aryl halides with alkyl boronic esters. Mechanistic experiments such as radical trapping experiments, stoichiometric Ar&#8722;Ni(II)&#8208;X mediated or Ar&#8722;Ni(II)&#8208;X, Ni(I)&#8208;X or Ni(0) catalyzed reactions, fluorescence quenching experiments etc. were performed. DFT calculations indicated that the cross&#8208;coupling likely proceeds via a Ni(I)&#8208;catalyzed pathway. In addition, the method can also be extended to alkyl boronic acids.







Abstract
Nickel/photoredox dual catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of aryl halides with alkylboron compounds is one of the effective methodologies for the construction of C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds. Although elegant results have been achieved by using alkyl trifluoroborates as alkyl radical precursors, the generation of alkyl radicals from readily available alkyl boronic esters is still limited due to their high oxidation potential. We disclosed here that activation of alkyl boronic esters by MeOLi is highly efficient for the generation of alkyl radicals under photocatalysis conditions. The reaction featured with a wide substrate scope, high functional group tolerance, and late&#8208;stage modification of bioactive substances. In addition, the method was also successfully extended to alkyl boronic acids. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies indicated that the cross&#8208;coupling likely proceeds via a Ni(I)&#8208;catalyzed pathway.

         <title>Development of a Synthetic Platform for Ent&#8208;Pimaranes Reveals their Potential as Novel Non&#8208;Redox Active Ferroptosis Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A full account of five distinct synthetic strategies towards a subfamily of ent&#8208;pimaranes is given. Highlights include radical and cationic polyene cyclizations for construction of the tricyclic core. Valuable insights from unsuccessful approaches informed the final route, which culminated in the enantioselective synthesis of eight ent&#8208;pimaranes. Biological investigations identified ent&#8208;pimaranes as novel and unusual non&#8208;redox active ferroptosis inhibitors.







Abstract
We present a comprehensive account on the evolution of a synthetic platform for a subfamily of ent&#8208;pimaranes. For the most complex member, norflickinflimiod C, five distinct strategies relying on either cationic or radical polyene cyclizations to construct the requisite tricyclic carbon scaffold were explored. Insights from early and late stage oxidative and reductive dearomatization studies ultimately led to a mild, rhodium&#8208;catalyzed arene hydrogenation for the final synthetic route. A Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation was found to be suitable to render the platform enantioselective and diversification of a late&#8208;stage key intermediate culminated in the total synthesis of eight ent&#8208;pimaranes in 11&#8211;16 steps. These compounds were found to inhibit the formation of pro&#8208;inflammatory leukotrienes and other 5&#8208;lipoxygenase products. Notably, three ent&#8208;pimaranes exhibited low micromolar, non&#8208;redox active ferroptosis inhibition with remarkable structural specificity.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Supramolecular Double Helix from a Tetrapeptide and Direct Visualization by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 310&#8208;helical tetrapeptide, through a combination of H&#8208;bonds and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions, self&#8208;assembles to give a supramolecular double helix. We succeed in building such a double helix in both single crystals and on the HOPG surface with direct visualization by STM.







Abstract
This work reports single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), and quantum mechanics calculations of the 310&#8208;helical peptide Z&#8208;(Aib)2&#8208;L&#8211;Dap(Boc)&#8208;Aib&#8208;NHiPr (Aib, &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid; Dap, 2,3&#8208;diaminopropionic acid; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; Boc, t&#8208;butoxycarbonyl). The peptide forms a double&#8208;helical superstructure, studied by XRD and STM. Such architecture is rare in short peptides. Here, we show, by combining XRD and STM that this intriguing conformational feature is not driven by crystal packing; rather, it is an intrinsic property of this peptide. Indeed, the double helix is clearly detected also by STM, where crystal packing cannot be invoked. XRD reveals that intermolecular H&#8208;bonds stabilize two left&#8208;handed supra&#8208;helices (tertiary structure) that develop around a 6&#8208;fold screw axis. Then, two supra&#8208;helices are intertwined in a quaternary structure as a left&#8208;handed, double supra&#8208;helix, where C&#8722;H&#8943;&#960; interactions play a crucial role. STM images show the formation of long, isolated &#8220;necklaces&#8221; (&gt;110&#8197;nm). They are of left and right helical handedness. Their size agrees with the XRD finding. DFT calculations allowed us to weigh the contribution of the different intermolecular interactions in the two single supra&#8208;helices and the supramolecular double&#8208;helix. Interestingly, we were able to conclude that the contribution of the C&#8722;H&#8943;&#960; interactions to the binding energies is close to 50&#8201;%.

         <title>Mo&#8722;O&#8722;Sn Bond Boosting Kinetics of MoO2&#8722;xSnO2/Sn Anode for High&#8208;Performance Li&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

A bimetallic MoO2&#8208;xSnO2/Sn nanoparticles uniformly anchored on N, S co&#8208;doped graphene nanosheets (MoO2&#8208;xSnO2/Sn@NSG) are developed as an anode electrode for Li&#8208;ion battery. In the MoO2&#8208;xSnO2/Sn nanocomposite, the generated Sn&#8722;O&#8722;Mo bond can modulate the electronic and composition structures to improve the intrinsic conductivity of SnO2 and reinforce the structural stability during cycles. Featuring excellent electronic conductivity and a hierarchical NBG matrix, the optimized MoO2&#8208;2SnO2/Sn@NSG anode exhibits excellent electrochemical properties.







Abstract
Obtaining a robust electrode composed of Sn&#8208;based metal oxides and carbonaceous matrix through nanoscale structure engineering is essential for effectively improving Li&#8208;ion batteries&#8217; electrochemical performance and stability. Herein, we report a bimetallic MoO2&#8208;xSnO2/Sn nanoparticles uniformly anchored on N, S co&#8208;doped graphene nanosheets (MoO2&#8208;xSnO2/Sn@NSG) as an anode electrode for Li&#8208;ion battery via a one&#8208;step hydrothermal and thermal treatment approach. In the MoO2&#8208;xSnO2/Sn nanocomposite, the generated Sn&#8722;O&#8722;Mo bond can modulate the electronic and composition structures to improve the intrinsic conductivity of SnO2 and reinforce the structural stability during cycles. Moreover, featuring excellent electronic conductivity via coupling of MoO2&#8208;xSnO2/Sn and hierarchical NBG matrix, the MoO2&#8208;xSnO2/Sn@NSG electrode possesses ultrafast electrochemical kinetics and superior long&#8208;term cycling stability and rate capability. Additionally, the hierarchical MoO2&#8208;2SnO2/Sn@NSG can suppress the aggregation and accommodate the volume variations of active substances, thereby providing more lithium storage sites. Consequently, the optimized MoO2&#8208;2SnO2/Sn@NSG anode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 904&#8197;mA&#8197;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and excellent cycling performance with the reversible capacity of 456&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 600 cycles. The universal synthesis technology of bimetallic oxide anodes for advanced LIBs may provide vital guidance in designing high&#8208;performance energy&#8208;storage materials.

         <title>Zero&#8208;Dimensional Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Single Crystals for the Sensitive Detection of Visible Light and X&#8208;Rays</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zero&#8208;dimensional lead&#8208;free MA3Bi2I9 single crystals with high anisotropy is developed to fabricate photo&#8208; and X&#8208;ray detectors with a low detection limit. Detectors perpendicular to the {001} crystal plane exhibit better weak light detection capabilities compared to devices parallel to the {001} crystal plane.







Abstract
The excellent performance and facile fabrication process of perovskite semiconductor materials make them highly promising candidates in the field of optoelectronic devices. Whether for visible light or X&#8208;rays, detectors with low detection limits can better identify weak light signals, significantly reducing the intensity of the received light source during device operation. In particular, for X&#8208;ray detectors, reducing X&#8208;ray dosage can greatly enhance the safety of X&#8208;ray imaging technology. This work develops detectors with low detection limit based on zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) MA3Bi2I9 single crystals. The anisotropy of MA3Bi2I9 and its influence on the detector&#8216;s performance were investigated in detail. Detectors perpendicular to the (001) crystal plane have better weak light detection capability and require significantly less light intensity compared to devices parallel to the (001) crystal plane. X&#8208;ray detector with a limit of detection (LoD) of 0.68&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 and sensitivity of 5072&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was obtained. The present study offers comprehensive insights into the operational mechanism of layered perovskites, which can provide valuable guidelines for future designs and fabrications of highly sensitive photo and X&#8208;ray detectors.

Fluorinated Heterocycles A comprehensive study on the physicochemical properties of gem&#8208;difluorinated saturated O&#8208;heterocyclic substituents, as well as their non&#8208;fluorinated and carbocyclic counterparts is reported. The potential of the title fragments for bioisosteric replacements in medicinal chemistry is illustrated by the synthesis and evaluation of MAPK inhibitors &#8211; analogs of clinical candidate R&#8208;1487.







Abstract
A comprehensive study on the physicochemical properties of gem&#8208;fluorinated O&#8208;heterocyclic substituents is reported. Systematic additive effects of introducing O&#8208; and gem&#8208;CF2 group introduction on acidic properties (pKa) of the corresponding carboxylic acids/protonated primary amines were demonstrated. The impact of the O/CF2 moieties on lipophilicity (LogP) was found to be complex; significant mutual influence of the corresponding polar moieties governed the compound's overall properties in this case. Biological evaluation of MAPK kinase inhibitors incorporating the title substituents demonstrated their utility as promising fragments for bioisosteric replacements in drug discovery campaigns.

         <title>Unveiling the Long&#8208;Awaited Aldehyde Intermediate in Oxidative Dephosphorylation: A Unique Approach to Access Useful Carboxaldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This is the first report to trap and isolate aldehyde intermediate from oxidative dephosphorylation reactions that typically generate symmetrically substituted alkenes from organophosphonates. Thus, a unique synthetic strategy has been developed to access structurally diverse aldehydes by oxidizing phosphonate carbanions using molecular oxygen.







Abstract
Oxidative dephosphorylation reactions usually generate symmetrically substituted alkenes from organophosphonates. Even the ubiquitous presence of oxygen can produce such alkenes inadvertently as a side product in small amounts from Wittig/Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons (HWE) reactions. So far, aldehydes have been expected to be the on&#8208;pathway intermediate since their discovery, but there was no substantial experimental evidence to support this. Herein, aldehyde intermediates are judiciously trapped before forming alkene on dephosphorylation reactions of diverse phosphonates. Consequently, a unique synthetic strategy has been established to access structurally diverse aldehydes by oxidizing phosphonate carbanions using molecular oxygen. This is the first report to trap and isolate aldehydes since the historical discovery of Wittig/HWE reactions. Only ketone/amide was isolated as a support, but no aldehyde. The optimization studies offer 48&#8211;84&#8201;% reaction yields of such aldehydes. The mechanistic studies are validated with reaction mixture 1H and 31P&#8208;NMR studies. Along with other various aldehydes, a unique class of structurally diverse anthracenyl aldehydes exhibiting intense fluorescence has been identified. The extended process to bis&#8208;phosphonates led to bis&#8208;carboxaldehyde forming in 52&#8211;68&#8201;% yield within 30&#8197;min. The scope is further extended to achieve 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole&#8208;linked phosphonate, functionalized with carboxaldehyde.

         <title>Red Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Non&#8208;Aromatic Carbonized Polymer Dots</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;aromatic red organic room temperature phosphorescence with emission at 605 and 645&#8197;nm is achieved through inducing and confining carboxyl dimer association (CDA), a unique hydrogen&#8208;bonded coupling red phosphorescence unit, in carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) with polyacrylic acid (PAA) and succinic acid (SA) as precursors.







Abstract
Achieving red organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) remains a significant challenge, especially in a non&#8208;aromatic system. Herein, red RTP with emission at 605 and 645&#8197;nm is achieved through inducing and confining carboxyl dimer association (CDA), a unique hydrogen&#8208;bonded coupling red phosphorescence unit, in non&#8208;aromatic carbonized polymer dots (CPDs). The CPDs are synthesized via microwave method by using polyacrylic acid (PAA), succinic acid (SA), and traces of phosphoric acid as precursors. Small molecule SA can flexibly enter the polymer cluster of PAA and pair with the isolated carboxyl groups to form CDA. The intrinsic local carbonized structure formed in CPDs can effectively stabilize CDA to achieve red RTP. The red afterglow can last for 1&#8197;s to naked eye, and the corresponding lifetimes for emission at 605 and 645&#8197;nm were 61 and 45&#8197;ms, respectively, after 365&#8197;nm excitation off. This work not only reported the non&#8208;aromatic red organic RTP materials for the first time, but also explored CPDs as an effective platform for achieving such non&#8208;aromatic long&#8208;wavelength RTP.

         <title>New Concept on the Generation and Regulation of Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has attracted tremendous attention. But the simultaneously rational control of chirality and luminescence still remains a challenge. This concept overviews the current advances in the diverse matching rules for the convenient generation and regulation of CPL, mainly including fluorescence&#8208;selective absorption, circularly polarized fluorescence energy transfer, and chiral communication.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has attracted tremendous attention because of its significant application prospect across multiple fields of three&#8208;dimensional display, data storage, and information encryption. Chirality and luminescence are two necessary prerequisites for the generation of CPL. However, controlling these two factors simultaneously in a rational manner remains a challenge. Herein, we highlight the recent advances on the rational generation and regulation of CPL through the new concept, named matching rules, mainly including fluorescence&#8208;selective absorption, circularly polarized fluorescence energy transfer, and chiral communication between excited state and ground state. An important commonality among these strategies is that they need a good overlap of the corresponding spectra between the luminescent part (fluorescence, phosphorescence, or CPL) and the chiral part (organic, inorganic, or organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials), which can be contactless and separate. Different from most previous studies, no covalent or noncovalent interactions between the two parts are required, which makes them more facile and convenient. Finally, we summarize the main advantages of these strategies and the current challenges. We expect this concept to offer insightful and novel understanding and inspiration on CPL generation and regulation.

         <title>Interfacial Oxygen Vacancy of CuOx&#8208;CeO2 Enhances H2O2 Activation and Pollutant Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing the ion exchange reverse loading strategy, the loading of inert CeO2 support onto reactive CuOx nanoparticles generates nanocomposite with abundant surface oxygen vacancies neighboring Cu and Ce as new active sites, resulting in remarkably improved activity for H2O2 activation and pollutant degradation.







Abstract
In the Fenton process, the development of catalysts with a wide pH range and good stability has been a long&#8208;term goal for water treatment purpose. This study proposes a strategy to solve this problem by preparing supported catalysts CuOx@CeO2&#8208;IE using an ion exchange reversed loading method. The generation of a large number of interfacial oxygen vacancies with Cu&#8208;OV&#8208;Ce (OV represents an oxygen vacancy site) structures prolongs the O&#8722;O bond of H2O2, promotes the rupture of the peroxide bond of H2O2, and thereby promotes the activation of H2O2 on the surface of the catalyst. The results show that with a H2O2 concentration of 5&#8197;mM and CuOx@CeO2&#8208;IE at 50&#8197;mg/L, the removal rate of bisphenol A is 94.1&#8201;% in 60&#8197;min, in which &#8226;&#8201;OH dominates the degradation process. Moreover, the system can operate well within a relatively wide pH range (4&#8211;8). This study provides a novel strategy for the design of Fenton catalysts with a wide pH suitability and excellent stability.

The generation of a large number of interfacial oxygen vacancies with Cu-O&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;-Ce (O&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; represents an oxygen vacancy site) structures prolongs the O&#8722;O bond of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, promotes the rupture of the peroxide bond of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and thereby promotes the activation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on the surface of the catalyst. The results show that with a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration of 5&#8197;mM and CuO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;@CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-IE at 50&#8197;mg/L, the removal rate of bisphenol A is 94.1&#8201;% in 60&#8197;min, in which &#8226;&#8201;OH dominates the degradation process. Moreover, the system can operate well within a relatively wide pH range (4&#8211;8). This study provides a novel strategy for the design of Fenton catalysts with a wide pH suitability and excellent stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A {Cr4Ln2} Complex with Exchange Coupled {Cr2} Units: Structural Description and Magnetic Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel {Cr4Ln2}, core with exchange coupled {Cr2} units (Ln = Gd and Dy) where Ln = Dy shows SMM behaviour at zero external field.







Abstract
We have prepared and structurally characterized pivalate based {CrIII4LnIII2} complexes with Ln = Dy and Gd as well as the Y analogue, with the overall formula [CrIII4LnIII2(mdea)2(piv)10(OH)4], Ln = Gd, Dy and Y. We are reporting a detailed experimental magnetic properties study, including magnetization relaxation dynamics and calorimetric data, supported with quantum chemical calculations. The synthesis of the Y derivative, allowed to precisely identify the Cr(III)&#8208;Cr(III) exchange interaction magnitude which proved moderately strong and in agreement with known magneto&#8208;structural correlations. This result agrees with the observed double bridged {Cr2&#8208;&#956;OH&#8208;&#956;OR} units within the {Cr4Ln2} complexes. The Gd(III) complex magnetic properties can be properly described with the already established exchange coupled {Cr2} units, and a unique Gd(III)&#8208;Cr(III) exchange coupling parameter which proved anti&#8208;ferromagnetic in nature. The MCE characterization of this complex based on magnetization and calorimetric data down to 2&#8197;K affords a moderate entropy change value, mainly affected by the strong Cr&#8208;Cr exchange interaction. The complex with Ln = Dy, showed SMM behaviour below 10&#8197;K under 0 DC applied field with negligible field dependence up to 3000&#8197;Oe and 10&#8197;kHz of AC field frequency. Two relaxation processes are clearly distinguished, with thermal barriers for an Orbach mechanism of ca. 20&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and 40&#8197;cm&#8722;1.

         <title>Selective Self&#8208;Assembly of Supramolecular Helices and Macrocycles Directed by Halogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular helices controlled by intermolecular I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8722;O&#8722;N+ halogen bonds and bimolecular supramolecular planar macrocycles controlled by intermolecular &#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N or &#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8722;O&#8722;N+ halogen bonds were selectively constructed from H&#8208;bonded arylamide foldamers with an equivalent degree of polymerization.







Abstract
In this study, several hydrogen&#8208;bonded arylamide foldamers (compounds 1&#8211;5) with the same degree of polymerization were designed and synthesized. The polyfluoroiodobenzene or iodoethynyl polyfluoroiodobenzene segment was modified as a halogen donor at the end of the monomer, and pyridine or pyridine oxynitride served as the corresponding halogen acceptor segment. The crystal structure of compound 1 indicates that the supramolecular double helices were constructed by stacking a P helix and an M helix in an antiparallel manner in the direction of intermolecular I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8722;O&#8722;N+ halogen bonding. The zig&#8208;zag&#8208;shaped linear structures of compounds 2 and 3 were generated under the induction of intermolecular I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N and I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8722;O&#8722;N+ halogen bonds. [1+1] near&#8208;planar bimolecular supramolecular macrocycles in compounds 4 and 5 were formed by multiple groups of effective intramolecular three&#8208;center hydrogen bonding and strong I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N and I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8722;O&#8722;N+ halogen bonds. Hirshfeld surface analysis and theoretical modelling of the halogen bonding energy were performed. The noncovalent interactions on the surface of the monomers and the halogen bonding energy were investigated in detail.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article provides a comprehensive overview of recent developments in the area of hydroxamate&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). It primarily focuses on their synthesis, structural characteristics, and porosity. Finally, it highlights the potential for future applications, including catalysis, small molecule capture, and semiconductive materials.







Abstract
This mini&#8208;review focuses on recent developments in hydroxamate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), which exhibit unique structures and properties distinct from those of carboxylate&#8208;based MOFs. Hydroxamates (RCONHO&#8722;) form MOFs with novel structural motifs and functionalities. In this review, synthetic strategies, structural characteristics, and functional applications of key examples of hydroxamate&#8208;based MOFs are described, providing insights into the influence of the hydroxamate ligand on the MOF properties compared to that of the carboxylate&#8208;based analogues.

         <title>Tuning of a Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework by Liquid&#8208;Assisted Mechanosynthesis between Trans&#8208;Aconitic Acid and Isonicotinamide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) system was developed using trans&#8208;aconitic acid and isonicotinamide via mechanochemical milling. The crystal structures were determined by SCXRD, microcrystal electron diffraction and synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction. PXRD verified the isostructurality, thermogravimetric analysis confirmed their stability and this study also showcase tunable HOF properties.







Abstract
Cocrystallization of trans&#8208;aconitic acid (TACA) and isonicotinamide (INA) using liquid assisted mechanochemical grinding results in a unique supramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) system encapsulating various organic solvents (liquid guest) with the formation of channel inclusion compounds. Dimension and shape of the framework is dependent on the solvent used during liquid assisted grinding (LAG). Although crystal structure of the cocrystal (TACA)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(INA)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(H2O)@(INA)0.5 has been determined by Single Crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD), crystal structures of 3 cocrystal HOFs were determined by microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) and synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction due to lack of suitable single crystal. PXRD analysis confirms isostructurality of various host&#8208;guest systems; whereas guest incorporation as well as stability of the HOFs were further confirmed using thermogravimetric analysis. This study demonstrates that the framework of HOFs can be tuned by varying solvent molecules used during LAG.

         <title>General Acetal&#8208;Protected Aldehyde Strategy for Facile Synthesis of Covalent Organic Frameworks with Splendid Crystallinity and Uniform Morphology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed a general acetal&#8208;protected aldehyde protocol for the facile synthesis of imine&#8208;linked COFs, which enables the simultaneous optimization of crystallinity and morphology. This synthetic approach demonstrates broad adaptability across various framework topologies, precursor species, and synthetic solvent systems, simplifying the typically laborious solvent screening process in COF synthesis.







Abstract
Crystallinity and morphology are critical factors that closely related to the properties and applications of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). However, the controlled synthesis of COFs with both high crystallinity and uniform morphology remains a significant challenge due to uncontrollable polymerization and complex reaction conditions. In this work, we present a general acetal&#8208;protected aldehyde protocol for the facile synthesis of imine&#8208;linked COFs, which enables the simultaneous optimization of crystallinity and morphology. Of the acetal&#8208;protected aldehydes explored, ethanediol&#8208;protected terephthalaldehyde (Tp&#8208;E) emerged as the most effective, balancing stability and reactivity to yield highly crystalline Py&#8208;COF&#8208;E with a well&#8208;defined hollow spherical morphology and a significantly enhanced BET surface area compared to its aldehyde&#8208;based counterpart Py&#8208;COF. This synthetic approach demonstrates broad adaptability across various framework topologies, precursor species, and synthetic solvent systems, simplifying the typically laborious solvent screening process in COF synthesis. Furthermore, Py&#8208;DBT&#8208;COF&#8208;E showed superior photocatalytic H2 evolution performance relative to Py&#8208;DBT&#8208;COF, despite their identical chemical compositions, emphasizing the critical role of crystallinity and morphology in determining functional performance. Overall, this study provides a versatile methodology for the controlled synthesis of COFs and offers valuable insights into the interconnected roles of morphology, crystallinity, and material performance.

         <title>Apoptosis&#8208;Inducing Activity of a 2&#8208;Hydroxyphenyl Benzamide&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Assembled Anion Channel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports readily prepared 2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl benzamide derivatives that self&#8208;assemble into chloride channels through intermolecular hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. Interestingly, transmembrane chloride transport mediated by the nanotubes induces apoptosis in a human breast cancer MCF&#8208;7&#8197;cell lines while remaining relatively non&#8208;toxic to non&#8208;cancerous cells.







Abstract
Despite the significant interest in designing artificial ion channels, there is limited availability of channel&#8208;forming molecules to tackle complex issues, especially in biological systems. Moreover, a major challenge is the scarcity of chloride transporters that can selectively induce toxicity in cancer cells while minimizing harm to normal healthy cells. This work reports a series of 2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl benzamide&#8208;based small molecules 1&#8201;a&#8211;1&#8201;c, which self&#8208;assemble to form barrel rosette&#8208;type artificial ion channels that adequately transport chloride ions across membranes. The formation of these ion channels primarily relies on intermolecular hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, as supported by the analysis of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Importantly, chloride ion transport by these compounds specifically triggers apoptosis in cancer cells while demonstrating relatively low toxicity toward non&#8208;cancerous cell lines.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced ArC(sp3)&#8722;F Bond Activation in Aqueous Media: From DFT Study to Molecular Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photophysical properties of DTMAs, a stepwise photo&#8208;defluorination mechanism and a photo&#8208;induced intramolecular single electron activation model for ArC(sp3)&#8722;F bond in photo&#8208;DAFEx reaction were revealed by TD(DFT) study. Guided by the theoretical studies, new molecules with long excitation wavelength and good activity in photo&#8208;DAFEx reaction were designed and synthesized experimentally.







Abstract
Trifluoromethylarenes (ArCF3) are crucial bioisosteres in medicinal chemistry, but catalyst&#8208;free and controlled photo&#8208;activation of the ArC(sp3)&#8722;F bond remains a significant challenge. The photo&#8208;induced defluorination acyl fluoride exchange (photo&#8208;DAFEx) of m&#8208;trifluoromethylaniline, induced by ultraviolet light, emerges as a promising novel photo&#8208;click reaction for photoaffinity drug discovery. However, the photophysical properties of NMe2PhF2C(sp3)&#8722;F derivatives and factors affecting ArC(sp3)&#8722;F bond activation in photo&#8208;DAFEx are not yet fully understood, hindering the development of new photo&#8208;defluorination reagents with longer absorption wavelength for the photo&#8208;DAFEx. Herein, the photophysical properties, the related mechanism and their affecting factors of a series of ArCF3 compounds are systematically studied using (TD)DFT methods. The skeleton of aromatic core is found to be intimately related to the absorption wavelength needed for ArC(sp3)&#8722;F bond activation. A photo&#8208;induced intramolecular single&#8208;electron activation model was proposed to rationalize the photo&#8208;activation of the ArC(sp3)&#8722;F bond. The transfer of excited electron to C(sp3)&#8722;F antibonding orbital determined the activation. Based on the above knowledge, three novel ArCF3 reagents with extended excitation wavelength were designed and predicted, and the absorption spectra and photo&#8208;defluorination reactivity of two of them with visible absorption wavelength were validated experimentally, which provided a theoretical guidance for designing next&#8208;generation photo&#8208;DAFEx.

         <title>A Kagome Lattice of Lanthanide Atoms in a 2D Er&#8208;Directed Metal&#8208;Organic Coordination Network</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The deposition and subsequent annealing of TTDP molecules, bestowing pyridyl moieties to promote metal&#8208;organic bonding, along with Er atoms on a Au(111) surface, enables the creation of a well&#8208;defined kagome lattice of lanthanide elements.







Abstract
Kagome lattices have attracted much attention due the very interesting properties they can exhibit, both from the electronic and the magnetic points of view, although much of the experimental studies have been reported on 3D metals or 2D nanosheets. In the past few years, on&#8208;surface synthesis has allowed the fabrication of strictly monolayer 2D metal&#8208;organic networks, many of them containing transition metals. In this paper we report the fabrication and the study of the electronic and magnetic properties of a monolayer 2D metal&#8208;organic network where the nodes are lanthanide atoms forming a kagome lattice.

         <title>A Stable Carbon&#8208;Centered Radical Showing Six Amphoteric Redox States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully conjugated system built by alternate fusion of four benzene and three cyclopentadiene rings is a further rare example of an air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable carbon&#8208;centered hydrocarbon radical. It was synthesized by double ortho fusion and was extensively characterized by spectroscopic and computational methods.







Abstract
An air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable hydrocarbon radical with four six&#8208; and three five&#8208;membered rings alternately fused to a heptacycle was obtained by ortho fusion in a suitably ortho,ortho&#8217;&#8208;substituted diphenylfluorene and subsequent re&#8208;establishment of the conjugation. The radical was obtained in five consecutive steps from commercially available starting materials with a total yield of 34&#8201;%; key steps are Suzuki couplings and cyclizing SEAr reactions. Mesityl substituents at the five&#8208;membered rings ensure the stability of the radical. This cyclopenta&#8208;fused polyaromatic hydrocarbon (CP&#8208;PAH) was characterized by EPR and UV/Vis spectroscopy and by cyclic voltammetry. Quantum chemical calculation disclosed further properties and led to simulated spectra (spin densities, aromaticity, orbital energies, and UV/Vis/NIR). This radical is best described with the unpaired electron centered in the outer five&#8208;membered rings; these resonance formulas show the largest number of fully intact benzene rings. Its triradical character was computed to be very small and can be neglected. The five&#8208;membered rings show notable antiaromatic character, especially in the central ring. The constitution of the radical could be further substantiated by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of its direct precursor.

         <title>Nucleophilic Amination of Aryl Halides with an Azanide Surrogate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the conversion of electron&#8208;deficient (hetero)aryl halides into primary N&#8208;aryl amines by using an anionic amidine nucleophile as an azanide (&#8722;NH2) surrogate. The developed surrogate is a safer and more selective alternative to existing anionic N&#8208;nucleophiles, such as alkali metal amides or azide salts.







Abstract
We report the development of an azanide (&#8722;NH2) surrogate which enables the facile conversion of electron&#8208;deficient (hetero)aryl halides into primary N&#8208;aryl amines under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. The designed amidine reagent is easy to prepare, bench stable, and undergoes facile N&#8208;arylation under basic conditions at 40&#8201;&#176;C. Intermediate N&#8208;aryl amidines are readily cleaved to form N&#8208;aryl amines in&#8197;situ through hydrolysis or base&#8208;promoted elimination. The developed surrogate is a safer and more selective alternative to existing anionic N&#8208;nucleophiles, such as alkali metal amides or azide salts.

         <title>Defluorinative Diazolation&#8208;Cyclization Relay for Synthesis of Furan&#8208;Bridged Triheterocycles and Colorimetric Sensor Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyaromatics, as the assembly of diverse cyclic &#960;&#8208;systems, exhibit unique physicochemical properties when compared to their individual constituents. In this study, we developed a strategic connection of two azacycles via a furan bridge through a defluorinative diazolation&#8208;cyclization reaction of trifluoromethyl enones and N&#8208;heterocycles. A range of modular 2,4&#8208;furan&#8208;bridged triheterocycles (FBTHs), featuring a C3&#8208;trifluoromethyl group, was synthesized with broad substrate scope and good regioselectivity under transition metal&#8208;free conditions. This three&#8208;component protocol was achieved through successive C(sp3)&#8208;F bond functionalization of one trifluoromethyl group, which is recognized for its stability and durability. Moreover, the synthetically useful functionalities such as bromide and formyl group could be easily installed on the resulting products, and the imidazole&#8208;containing FBTH could serve as a valuable ligand in the preparation of an advanced colorimetric sensor, thereby underscoring their potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Fisetin as a Blueprint for Senotherapeutic Agents &#8212; Elucidating Geroprotective and Senolytic Properties with Molecular Modeling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeting senescent cells and the factors that accelerate this pathological state has recently emerged as a novel field in medicinal chemistry. As attention shifts to synthetic substances, studies on natural agents are often overlooked. In this paper, we present a detailed computational modeling study that encompasses quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics to elucidate the senotherapeutic activity of fisetin. The mitochondrial environment, serving as a proxy for senescence, received special attention. Throughout the study, fisetin&#8217;s outstanding geroprotective properties&#8212;exhibiting significant potential against&#160;&#8226;OOH, O2&#8226;&#8211;, and&#160;&#8226;OH radicals, surpassing those of Trolox or ascorbate&#8212;were identified. Furthermore, fisetin demonstrated a high capacity to restore oxidatively damaged biomolecules to their pristine forms, thereby renewing the functionality of proteins and amino acids. The senolytic properties were examined in terms of Bcl&#8211;2 and Bcl&#8211;xL inhibition. The results indicated that fisetin not only binds effectively to these proteins but also, with appropriate modifications, may exhibit specific selectivity toward either target. This study highlights fisetin&#8217;s remarkable activity in these areas and provides a molecular description of the underlying processes, paving the way for future research.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we report the high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state synthesis and intriguing optical features of Bi3+/Ln3+ doped Ca2YTi2Ga3O12 (CYT). The optical properties of CYT were fine&#8208;tuned by judiciously substituting Zr4+ ions at Ti4+ sites and Bi3+, Ln3+ ions at Y3+ sites. All these compounds are crystallized in a cubic crystal system with an Ia&#8208;3d (no. 230) space group. The Bi3+ doped systems showed a broad photoluminescence (PL) band in the yellow&#8208;orange region centered at ~552 nm from the metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer state (MMCT). The yellow&#8208;orange emissive CYT:Bix was co&#8208;doped with blue emissive Tm3+ to obtain an excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent color tuneable white light phosphor CYT:Tm0.02Bi0.012. Substituting Zr4+ ions in place of Ti4+ ions in CYT gave rise to CYTZ (Ca2YTi2&#8208;mZrmGa3O12), which upon doping with Bi gave Ca2YZr2Ga3O12:Bix (CYZ:Bix) and they exhibit the 3P0,1 &#8594; 1S0 emission in the violet&#8208;indigo region (&#955;em = 395 nm; &#955;ex = 315 nm). On co&#8208;doping CYTZ:Bix with Sm3+ ions produced white light emissive Ca2YTi0.1Zr1.9Ga3O12:Bi3+; Sm3+, (CYTZ:Bi3+; Sm3+). CYT:Bix showed slower (microsecond) PL decay than the CYZ:Bix (nanosecond). The crystal structure, steady state, and time&#8208;resolved optical studies, and semiempirical calculations were employed to rationalize the optical features. The optical features of CYT:Bi0.1, were explored for potential applications in secret writing.</dc:description>

         <title>Helical Supramolecular Polymers Formed via Head&#8208;to&#8208;Tail Host&#8208;Guest Complexation of Chiral Bisporphyrin Monomers with Trinitrofluorenone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intermolecular host&#8208;guest complexation of head&#8208;to&#8208;tail monomers consisting of cleft&#8208;shaped bisporphyrin and trinitrofluorenone units connected by a chiral binaphthyl linker was employed to construct helically twisted supramolecular polymers. Results from 1H NMR, diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy, and viscometry experiments revealed that the supramolecular polymerization of these monomers follows a ring&#8208;chain competition mechanism. The introduction of bulky substituents at the linker significantly suppressed the formation of macrocyclic oligomers, whereas smaller alkyl chains facilitated the formation of the cyclic form. The chirally twisted structures of the supramolecular polymers were confirmed using circular dichroism spectroscopy. Atomic force microscopy revealed that the (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;configurations of the binaphthyl linkers induced right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed helical structures, respectively, in the supramolecular polymer chains. The absence of cooperativity in the supramolecular copolymerization of (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;1a resulted in the formation of stereo&#8208;random supramolecular copolymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;molecular charge redistributions in H&#8208;bonded Cyanuric Acid*Melamine (CA*M) networks: insight from core level spectroscopy and natural bond orbital analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we elucidate the electronic charge redistributions that occur within the cyanuric acid (CA) and melamine (M) molecules upon formation of the triple H&#8208;bond between the imide group of CA and the diaminopyridine group of M. To achieve this, we investigated 2D H&#8208;bonded assemblies of M, CA and CA*M grown on the Au(111) surface, using X&#8208;ray photoemission (XPS) and near edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopies. Compared to the homomolecular networks, the spectra of the mixed sample reveal core level shifts in opposite directions for CA and M, indicating a nearly complementary charge accumulation on the CA molecule and a charge depletion on the M molecule. These findings were further confirmed by theoretical simulation of the ionization potentials (IPs), which were computed using unsupported models of the H&#8208;bonded networks. A natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis performed on the three systems helped to rationalize the net charge transfer form M to CA. Finally, we observed that intramolecular interactions (electron delocalization effects) contribute progressively to the charge redistributions inside the two molecules when going from the homomolecular to the heteromolecular networks.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this work, we elucidate the electronic charge redistributions that occur within the cyanuric acid (CA) and melamine (M) molecules upon formation of the triple H-bond between the imide group of CA and the diaminopyridine group of M. To achieve this, we investigated 2D H-bonded assemblies of M, CA and CA*M grown on the Au(111) surface, using X-ray photoemission (XPS) and near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopies. Compared to the homomolecular networks, the spectra of the mixed sample reveal core level shifts in opposite directions for CA and M, indicating a nearly complementary charge accumulation on the CA molecule and a charge depletion on the M molecule. These findings were further confirmed by theoretical simulation of the ionization potentials (IPs), which were computed using unsupported models of the H-bonded networks. A natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis performed on the three systems helped to rationalize the net charge transfer form M to CA. Finally, we observed that intramolecular interactions (electron delocalization effects) contribute progressively to the charge redistributions inside the two molecules when going from the homomolecular to the heteromolecular networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Impact of Single Amino Acid Insertion on the Supramolecular Assembly Pathway of Aromatic Peptide Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the mechanism of self&#8208;assembly driven by non&#8208;covalent interactions is crucial for designing supramolecular materials with desired properties. Here we investigate the self&#8208;assembly of aromatic peptide amphiphiles, Fmoc&#8208;L2QG and Fmoc&#8208;L3QG using a combination of spectroscopic, transmission electron and superresolution optical microscopy techniques. Our results show that Fmoc&#8208;L2QG leads to concentration&#8208;dependent assembly, forming fibrous assemblies at low concentrations and supramolecular droplets via liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) at higher concentrations. Mechanical activation using for example ultrasonication triggered the transition from metastable droplets to fibre morphologies of Fmoc&#8208;L2QG. In contrast, Fmoc&#8208;L3QG followed both on&#8208;pathway and off&#8208;pathway routes, resulting in the formation of fibrous morphologies regardless of concentration. Seeding experiments revealed that homo&#8208;seeds of the same peptide sequence accelerated the on&#8208;pathway process, while hetero&#8208;seeds of a mismatched peptide sequences accelerated the off&#8208;pathway process, highlighting the competing nature of the complex assembly profile. These findings demonstrate the significant impact of single amino acid insertion on the supramolecular assembly process of oligopeptide monomers, and highlight the potential for controlling the structure and dynamics of peptide materials. Pathway engineering of oligopeptide building blocks and multidomain supramolecular monomers will open new avenues in tailor&#8208;made and customizable supramolecular biomaterials.</dc:description>

A selective association of acyl radical formed in&#8208;situ during aldehyde autoxidation with Pd&#8208;catalysis is the key to the process.

         <title>Mechanism&#8208;Guided Development of Bifunctional Cyclooctenes as Active, Practical, and Light&#8208;Gated Bromination Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most molecular catalysts have been developed employing polar functional groups as catalytic sites. However, the use of non&#8208;polar functional groups for catalysis has received less attention due to their modest molecular interactions while the bioorthogonal reactivity of non&#8208;polar alkenes as substrates is frequently used in click chemistry. In this study, we conducted mechanistic studies on the catalysis of trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) derivatives with the strained olefin as the catalytic site using kinetic and computational analyses to aid the design of more active olefin catalysts. The analysis reveals the significant role of the benzyl substituents in accelerating the generation of bromonium species through dispersion interaction in the rate&#8208;determining step. Guided by the mechanistic insights, we developed bifunctional TCO catalysts bearing a functionalized benzyl group, taking advantage of the remarkable substituent effects. Experimental studies confirmed the theoretical model and revealed that TCO with a para&#8208;hydroxybenzyl group provided excellent catalytic activity. Furthermore, inclusion of the functionalized benzyl groups allowed more readily available and robust cis&#8208;cyclooctenes to be used as active catalysts, expanding the practical utility of the olefin catalysts. By using a photochemically labile masking group on the para&#8208;hydroxybenzyl substituent, the first light&#8208;gated bromination catalyst was developed, enabling spatiotemporal control of the transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;Transition&#8208;Dipole Stacking of Conjugated Organic Molecules: Structure, Exciton Behavior and Optoelectronic Property</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cross&#8208;transition&#8208;dipole stacking enables weak exciton coupling, leads to exciton localization, and induces chirality in organic solids, which emerged as a unique molecular stacking mode for enhanced optoelectronic properties. This mini&#8208;review offers an in&#8208;depth insight and perspective in this packing mode.







Abstract
Organic conjugated molecules have gained widespread application as organic semiconductors due to their unique optoelectronic properties. The rigidity of these large conjugated structures facilitates strong intermolecular interactions, which significantly influence their properties in the solid state through various molecular arrangements. The study of the relationship among molecular arrangement, exciton behavior, and optoelectronic properties is an eternal research topic. Cross&#8208;dipole stacking is a specific molecular arrangement that demonstrates unique characteristics and has received continuous attention over the past decades. This mini&#8208;review will first discuss the unique exciton behaviors in cross&#8208;dipole stacking based on exciton models, including weak exciton coupling and suppression of F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer. These exciton behaviors, determined by molecular stacking arrangements, are fundamental to the optoelectronic properties of cross&#8208;dipole stacking systems. Next, we will introduce well&#8208;defined cross&#8208;dipole systems and summarize their design principles from a molecular structure perspective. Finally, we will present the specific optoelectronic properties of cross&#8208;dipole stacking systems and their outstanding performance, such as high solid&#8208;state luminescence, good charge carrier mobility, and significant CD/CPL. Through this mini&#8208;review, we hope to enhance the understanding of cross&#8208;dipole stacking, contributing to the construction of such systems, the exploration of excited&#8208;state behaviors, and the discovery of high&#8208;performance materials.

         <title>Utilizing Alkyne&#8208;Nitrone Cycloaddition for the Convenient Multi&#8208;Component Assembly of Protein Degraders and Biological Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a fast, modular, and convenient multi&#8208;component assembly strategy of multi&#8208;functional molecules via strain&#8208;promoted alkyne&#8211;nitrone cycloaddition (SPANC), facilitating the synthesis of proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and biological probes. The 2&#8208;component PROTACs were assembled via SPANC in&#8197;vivo. The 3&#8208;component PROTACs were assembled by sequential nitrone formation and SPANC, and photocages can be used to provide extra control of protein degradation.







Abstract
Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have become a popular therapeutic strategy, and the development of multi&#8208;functional PROTACs has added complexity to their synthetic process. Although click reactions have been widely applied to prepare highly functionalized biomolecules, most of them are limited to two&#8208;component reactions, restricting the creation of more complex structures. Here, we developed a convenient multi&#8208;component assembly strategy via strain&#8208;promoted alkyne&#8211;nitrone cycloaddition (SPANC), which can be extended to a 3&#8208;component reaction when combined with nitrone formation. Using the 2&#8208;component assembly, we demonstrated the targeted protein degradation with both preassembled and in&#8208;cell assembled PROTACs. This strategy was also applied to facilitate the screening of E3 ligases in PROTACs and the preparation of various biological probes. Moreover, the 3&#8208;component assembly, via sequential nitrone formation and SPANC, enabled the synthesis of trifunctional 3&#8208;component PROTACs. The N&#8208;substituent, serving as an additional functional moiety, was designed as a photocage for sterically controlling PROTAC activity. The 3&#8208;component assembly can be further modified to provide additional control or enhance the cell&#8208;targeting ability of PROTACs. In short, our multi&#8208;component SPANC assembly strategy offers a modular and versatile synthetic platform for creating multi&#8208;functional PROTACs and biological probes.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Dehydration of 1&#8208;Aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;Ethanediols to Methyl Ketones Driven by Eosin Y Fragmentation Products</title>

         <dc:description>
&#8220;How would you remove water from your molecule with light?&#8221; Herein, we report a mild photocatalytic dehydration protocol for aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;ethanediols. Our mechanistic studies suggest a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and a 1,2&#8208;spin center shift (SCS) as key steps. Eosin Y photodissociation products serve as a highly efficient catalytic mixture.







Abstract
Herein, we report a mild photocatalytic redox&#8208;neutral dehydration of aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;ethanediols forming the respective methyl ketones. In the proposed mechanistic cycle an initial hydrogen atom abstraction (HAT) is followed by a 1,2&#8208;spin center shift (SCS) as key steps. Interestingly, Eosin Y was found to act as a pre&#8208;catalyst dissociating into a catalytically active mixture under irradiation. To the best of our knowledge, this exemplifies the first synthetic utilization of Eosin Y degradation products. As a result, our reaction can be realized with a single organic photocatalyst and releases water as a sole by&#8208;product.

         <title>Basic&#8208;Functionalized Ionic Porous Organic Polymers: Triple Roles in One for Highly Efficient and Recyclable Carboxylative Cyclization of CO2 under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Basic&#8208;functionalized ionic porous organic polymers (IPOPs) DCX&#8208;4&#8208;Tetz/Ag2O exhibited highly efficient and recyclable performance for the cycloaddition of CO2 under mild condition due to its triple roles as adsorbent, activator and stabilizer, eliminating the use of extra organic bases.







Abstract
The transformation of carbon dioxide (CO2) into high&#8208;value chemicals is a significant step towards achieving the goal of &#8220;carbon neutrality&#8221;. &#945;&#8208;methylene cyclic carbonate, as an intermediate for the synthesis of many important organic compounds, is widely employed in industrial productions. In this work, a series of ionic porous organic polymers (IPOPs) with different basic&#8208;functionalized anions were successfully synthesized and adjusted to have certain BET surface areas and high contents of ion sites by post&#8208;modification. These basic&#8208;functionalized IPOPs could exhibit excellent catalytic performance for carboxylative cyclization of CO2 at 30&#8201;&#176;C and 1&#8197;bar in presence of silver salts, eliminating the use of the extra organic bases. In the whole catalytic reaction, the basic&#8208;functionalized anions could play triple roles: enriching CO2 for further transformation, activating the hydroxyl groups of substrates to improve the catalytic performance, while coordinating with Ag atom to stabilize and regenerate catalyst. Notably, the catalytic system of DCX&#8208;4&#8208;Tet/Ag2O exhibited excellent recyclability, and the yield of &#945;&#8208;alkylidene cyclic carbonate was well maintained at 99&#8201;% after 5&#8197;cycles. To the best of our knowledge, the catalytic system was the first example of basic&#8208;functionalized IPOPs that played multiple roles for highly efficient CO2 cyclization under mild conditions without any extra organic bases.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Ligand Functionalization Reverses Hypsochromic Luminescence Shifts in Platinum(II) Complexes of Benzannulated NCN&#8208;Coordinating Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversing the Trend: Phenanthridine (benzo[c]quinoline) donors defy conventional logic that increasing ligand benzannulation leads to bathochromic (red) shifts in the absorption and emission of their coordination complexes. Here, we provide a counterfactual that reverses this trend: substitution at the phenanthridine 6&#8208;position (i.&#8201;e., at the C=N sub&#8208;unit) breaks the phenanthridine's tendency to cause hypsochromic luminescence shifts.







Abstract
Ligands containing phenanthridine (benzo[c]quinoline) have presented notable exceptions to the conventional logic that increasing ligand benzannulation leads to bathochromic (red) shifts in the absorption and emission of their coordination complexes. The counterintuitive blue shifts have been attributed to the peculiar structure of phenanthridines, whose ground states are dominated by imine&#8208;bridged biphenyl resonance contributors. These serve to isolate the C=N unit electronically from the rest of the ligand framework and allow the C=N moiety to act as a &#8216;shock&#8208;absorber&#8217;, buffering against larger molecular distortions in a molecule's excited state, and reducing the observed pseudo&#8208;Stokes&#8217; shift. Here, we provide experimental evidence for this assertion in the form of a counterfactual that reverses this trend: substitution at the phenanthridine 6&#8208;position (i.&#8201;e., at the C=N sub&#8208;unit) breaks the phenanthridine's tendency to cause hypsochromic luminescence shifts. The synthesis, full characterization, and comparison of 2&#8208;quinolinyl and 6&#8208;phenanthridinyl exemplars is provided, supported by a detailed theoretical treatment.

         <title>Peptide Designs for Cell&#8208;Interfacing Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept review underscores the pivotal role of designing cell&#8208;interfacing peptide assemblies, including the precise control of displayed molecules, the regulation of molecular dynamics to modulate cell behaviors, and responsiveness to biological stimuli. Finally, the development of advanced cell&#8208;interfacing biomaterials is summarized and prospected.







Abstract
Constructing synthetic materials to interact with cells offers significant promise for understanding natural cellular processes and manipulating cell behaviors beyond nature's capabilities. Peptide assemblies are particular promising in this regard, as they have demonstrated efficacy in promoting cell differentiation, repair, and regeneration as supportive scaffolds. However, distinct gaps persist between natural and synthetic assembly systems in various aspects. This Concept review explores representative studies focusing on developing chemical strategies to design peptide assemblies with precise control over displayed molecules, adjustable molecular dynamics to modulate cell behaviors, and responsiveness to biological stimuli. This paper would inspire more fundamental studies on molecular assemblies and foster inter&#8208;disciplinary interests in material applications, advancing the interplay between natural cells and synthetic materials.

         <title>Facile Fabrication of Novel S&#8208;scheme Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4/Zeolite Photocatalyst for Boosting Photocatalytic Tetracycline Degradation and Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel S&#8208;scheme Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4/zeolite ternary photocatalyst performed dramatically enhanced photocatalytic TC degradation and hydrogen evolution performance. The improved photocatalytic activity was mainly due to the synergistic effect of S&#8208;scheme Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4 heterojunction and zeolite support. This study provides a promising strategy to develop a low&#8208;cost, efficient, and stable photocatalyst for photocatalytic antibiotic wastewater treatment and hydrogen production.







Abstract
This study presents a novel ternary Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4/zeolite composite for photocatalytic H2 production and TC degradation through S&#8208;scheme electron transport. The S&#8208;scheme Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4 heterojunction was successfully constructed on zeolite surface through calcination and precipitation processes. The results indicated that Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4/zeolite&#8208;50&#8201;% presented dramatically enhanced photocatalytic TC degradation performance, and the TC degradation efficiency was up to 92.86&#8201;% in 180&#8197;min under visible light. The corresponding reaction rate constant was 0.01205&#8197;min&#8722;1 which was 2.18 and 7.48 times greater than those of pure Ag3PO4 (0.00554&#8197;min&#8722;1) and g&#8208;C3N4 (0.00161&#8197;min&#8722;1), respectively. Meanwhile, the highest H2 production rate (2748.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) was achieved over Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4/zeolite&#8208;50&#8201;% under simulated solar light which was around 26.5 and 5.6 times higher than that of g&#8208;C3N4 and Ag3PO4, respectively. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the ternary composite was mainly due to the synergistic effect of S&#8208;scheme Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4 heterojunction and zeolite support which endowed the composite with excellent adsorption activity, enhanced light response ability, and efficient separation of photoinduced carriers. TC degradation mechanism and pathways were proposed based on quenching experiment and HPLC&#8208;MS results. Overall, this study proposes a promising strategy for significantly improving photocatalytic activity and applying in photocatalytic pollutant degradation and hydrogen production.

The results indicated that Ag&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/zeolite-50&#8201;% presented dramatically enhanced photocatalytic TC degradation performance, and the TC degradation efficiency was up to 92.86&#8201;% in 180&#8197;min under visible light. The corresponding reaction rate constant was 0.01205&#8197;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; which was 2.18 and 7.48 times greater than those of pure Ag&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (0.00554&#8197;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (0.00161&#8197;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), respectively. Meanwhile, the highest H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate (2748.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) was achieved over Ag&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/zeolite-50&#8201;% under simulated solar light which was around 26.5 and 5.6 times higher than that of g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Ag&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the ternary composite was mainly due to the synergistic effect of S-scheme Ag&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; heterojunction and zeolite support which endowed the composite with excellent adsorption activity, enhanced light response ability, and efficient separation of photoinduced carriers. TC degradation mechanism and pathways were proposed based on quenching experiment and HPLC-MS results. Overall, this study proposes a promising strategy for significantly improving photocatalytic activity and applying in photocatalytic pollutant degradation and hydrogen production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Click Coupling of Flavylium Dyes with Plasmodione Analogues: Towards New Redox&#8208;Sensitive Pro&#8208;Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;sensitive pro&#8208;fluorophores based on azido&#8208;flavyliums clicked to alkynyl analogues of plasmodione oxide have been developed. In their quinone form, the fluorescence is quenched by photoinduced electron process (PeT) and restored after reducing to hydroquinone. PEG chain length modulates the amplitude of fluorogenic response. Due to their properties, these hybrid compounds have the potential to evaluate redox alterations in parasitized erythrocytes.







Abstract
The development of redox&#8208;sensitive molecular fluorescent probes for the detection of redox changes in Plasmodium falciparum&#8208;parasitized red blood cells remains of interest due to the limitations of current genetically encoded biosensors. This study describes the design, screening and synthesis of new pro&#8208;fluorophores based on flavylium azido dyes coupled by CuAAC click chemistry to alkynyl analogues of plasmodione oxide, the key metabolite of the potent redox&#8208;active antimalarial plasmodione. The photophysical and electrochemical properties of these probes were evaluated, focusing on their fluorogenic responses. The influence of both the redox status of the quinone and the length of the PEG chain separating the fluorophore from the electrophore on the photophysical properties was investigated. The fluorescence quenching by photoinduced electron transfer is reversible and of high amplitude for probes in oxidized quinone forms and fluorescence is reinstated for reduced hydroquinone forms. Our results demonstrate that shortening the PEG chain has the effect of enhancing the fluorogenic response, likely due to non&#8208;covalent interactions between the two chromophores. All these systems were evaluated for their antiparasitic activities and fluorescence imaging suggests the efficacy of the fluorescent flavylium dyes in P. falciparum&#8208;parasitized red blood cells, paving the way for future parasite imaging studies to monitor cellular redox processes.

         <title>Mild&#8208;Temperature Catalyzed Hydrosilylation for Simplified Carbohydrate Functionalization of Porous Silicon Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot hydrosilylation strategy is developed for the functionalization of porous silicon nanoparticles (PSiNPs) with allyl&#8208;tetra&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranoside (ATAG), using mild temperatures and ethylaluminium dichloride solution (EtAlCl2) as a catalyst. This efficient method reduces reaction times for passivating and bioengineering PSiNPs, enhancing their stability and potential for biomedical applications.







Abstract
Porous silicon is one of the most explored nanostructured materials in various biomedical applications owing to its remarkable properties. However, its inherent chemical instability mandates a robust surface modification procedure, and proper surface bioengineering is essential to ensure its effectiveness in the biomedical field. In this study, we introduce a one&#8208;pot functionalization strategy that simultaneously stabilizes porous silicon nanoparticles and decorates their surface with carbohydrates through hydrosilylation chemistry, combining mild temperatures and a Lewis acid catalyst. This approach yielded a surface functionalization degree of 300&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 in just 4&#8197;hours at 60&#8201;&#176;C, significantly reducing both the prolonged reaction times and high temperatures typically associated with conventional hydrosilylation. Furthermore, this advancement opens the way for utilizing thermolabile molecules useful for surface bioengineering.

         <dc:description>Pd&#8208;catalyzed alkoxycarbonylation of internal alkynes provides a straightforward access to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted acrylic esters. Compared with the well&#8208;established regioselective alkoxycarbonylation of terminal alkynes, the regioselective hydrocarboxylation of non&#8208;functionalized unsymmetric internal alkynes was more challenging owing to the delicate differences of properties between the two substituents. Herein, by using either monophosphine ligand based on 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzo[d][1,3]oxaphosphole motif or bidentate ligand Ph&#8208;Phox, the regioselective alkoxycarbonylations of aryl&#8208;aryl, aryl&#8208;alkyl and alkyl&#8208;alkyl disubstituted alkynes were achieved, giving a diversity of trisubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic esters with moderate to excellent yields and high regioselectivity.

         <title>Structural Characteristics of a Partially Planarized Triarylmethyl Cation with Unsymmetrical Push&#8211;Pull Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the physical properties of a new class of triarylmethyl&#8208;based carbocations containing both an electron&#8208;donating diphenyl ether moiety and an electron&#8208;accepting carbonyl group with a helical plane framework. Their unique packing patterns were clarified by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, which depend on the counter anions to influence their photophysical properties in the solid states. Notably, the interactions between &#960;&#8208;cation species and planar anion species lead to a unique panchromatic property, accompanying a near&#8208;infrared absorption with a &#955;onset value of 1030 nm, which can be assigned to intermolecular charge transfer transition. We found that the &#960;&#8208;cation species with planar anion formed cation dimers, being stacked in opposite directions. The two cation molecules are flanked by two anions on both the top and bottom side. Pair interaction energy decomposition analysis (PIEDA) calculations imply that the origins of the unique packing patterns of the &#960;&#8208;cations originate from the electrostatic forces of four neighbouring &#960;&#8208;anion species.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A new miniaturized framework for graphitic material featuring three neighboring pyridinic nitrogen atoms is disclosed. The quinoline/quinazoline hybridized pseudo trimeric macrocycle, DiQuinoline(Q)&#8208;MonoQuinazolines(Qz), Q2Qz1, was readily synthesized from the key macrocyclic amide precursor in a modular fashion. Its central cavity strongly captures a proton, and the thus&#8208;formed positively charged, highly planar architecture exhibits supramolecular complexation through &#120587;&#8208;interactions. Q2Qz1, with its unique properties, was applied as a scavenger for toxic polyaromatic hydrocarbons and as a G&#8208;quartet ligand for potential therapeutic agent for cancer chemotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterogeneous Catalytic Oxidations with In Situ&#8208;Generated Hypervalent Iodine&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous organic polymers (POPs) are novel emergent materials for heterogeneous organocatalysis owing to their remarkable physicochemical stabilities. Through a bottom&#8208;up approach entailing diligent design of twisted biaryl building blocks with in&#8208;built o&#8208;iodobenzoic acid (IA) moieties, a series of POP precatalysts, p&#8208;OMeIA&#8208;POP, DiMeIA&#8208;POP, and m&#8208;OMeIA&#8208;POP, were synthesized by employing Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation. These IA&#8208;POP precatalysts can undergo in situ oxidation in the presence of Oxone&#174; to generate hypervalent iodine(V) species (&#955;5&#8208;iodanes), in particular, modified o&#8208;iodoxybenzoic acid, popularly termed IBX, which mediates diverse oxidative transformations. The applications of m&#8208;OMeIA&#8208;POP as a heterogeneous precatalyst in the presence of Oxone&#174; are demonstrated for facile oxidation of i) primary and secondary alcohols to carbonyl compounds, ii) cleavage of olefins, vicinal diols, and acyloins into carboxylic acids and iii) oxidation of diols to lactones; the in situ formation of the &#955;5&#8208;iodane species in catalytic amounts precludes potential explosive attributes of IBX. It is shown that the IA&#8208;precatalyst (m&#8208;OMeIA&#8208;POP) can be easily recycled without any loss of catalytic activity. The results constitute the first demonstration of the development of IA&#8208;bearing POP precatalysts for in situ generation of hypervalent iodine(V) species and various heterogeneous oxidations mediated therefrom.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Mechanochromism of a Platinum Complex with Four Monodentate Ligands Governed by Intramolecular Interactions Between Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A platinum complex equipped with 3&#8208;methylbenzofuryl groups was prepared and its crystal structure and emission properties were investigated. This platinum complex has two distinctly emissive polymorphs: a blue&#8208;emissive polymorph with low intensity and a brightly green&#8208;emissive polymorph. Upon mechanical stimulation, the blue&#8208;emitting phase is converted to green&#8208;emitting powder through a crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal phase transition. Structure analyses indicated that intramolecular interactions between ligands control the phase&#8208;transition behavior and the emission properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescence and Generation of Reactive Oxygen Species in Solution by Ta6Br12 Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An intrinsic metal cluster NIR&#8208;II emission of the {Ta6Br12}2+ aqua/hydroxocomplexes was determined in aqueous solutions under inert atmosphere. The photoluminescence (PL) is enhanced in D2O, and the lifetime scale expands from nanoseconds to microseconds. Possible cluster emission transitions have been assigned and analyzed from a computational perspective. In the presence of O2, the cluster compound kept its robustness but showed partial quenching of the PL. Stern&#8208;Volmer and laser&#8208;flash photolysis studies confirmed that quenching is mainly associated with O2 diffusion. Laser&#8208;flash photolysis experiments showed that singlet oxygen (1O2) was not detected under measurement conditions. Generation of peroxide and superoxide radical species after irradiation in D2O was confirmed by using luminol as a probe, whereas no hydroxide radical species were detected as evidenced by the emission of the 3&#8208;coumarin carboxylic acid (3&#8208;CCA) molecular sensor.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances in Chiral Macrocycles: Molecular Design and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral macrocycles have recently emerged as promising materials for enantioselective recognition, asymmetric catalysis, and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) due to their terminal&#8208;free structure, preorganized chiral cavities, and unique host&#8208;guest and self&#8208;assembly properties. This review summarizes recent advances in the design and synthesis of chiral macrocycles with central, axial, helical, and planar chirality, each imparting distinct structural and chiroptical characteristics. We highlight key strategies for constructing these macrocycles and their applications in optoelectronic and catalytic systems. Emphasis is placed on the balance between rigidity and flexibility in macrocycle design, essential for effective molecular recognition, adaptable catalysis, and CPL. We conclude with perspectives on future opportunities, anticipating ongoing developments in chiral macrocycle research.</dc:description>

         <title>Screening of an Antibacterial and Coagulation Multifunctional Peptide and Its Application in Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a new type of drug developed in the era of antibiotics, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have great potential in antibacterial, antiviral and antitumor aspects. Different from the principle of action of antibiotics, AMPs have a better effect on resisting drug&#8208;resistant bacteria. We synthesized a peptide library using solid&#8208;phase synthesis and successfully screened the antimicrobial peptide RKGAK. AMPs provide effective defense against both bacteria and fungi. Research has found that the lowest inhibitory concentrations of RKGAK against S. aureus, E. coli, and C. albicans are 75 &#956;g/mL, 100 &#956;g/mL, and 300 &#956;g/mL. Not only that, this antibacterial peptide also has certain antiviral and coagulation effects. It is a multifunctional peptide that has great potential in many biomedical fields. It also has the advantages of being less likely to develop drug resistance, low hemolytic activity and low cytotoxicity. Loading the peptide into hydrogels has achieved good results in applications that promote wound healing.</dc:description>

         <title>Dehydrocoupling of Phosphine&#8208;Borane Adducts Under Ambient Conditions using Aminoboranes as Hydrogen Acceptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the reactivity of aminoboranes (R2N=BH2; R =&#160;iPr, Et, Me) with phosphine&#8208;borane adducts (PhR&#697;PH&#8226;BH3; R&#697; = H, Ph): sufficiently sterically unencumbered aminoboranes can accept hydrogen from phosphine&#8208;borane adducts. The hydrogen transfer results in the formation of amine&#8208;borane adducts (R2NH&#8226;BH3) and transient phosphinoboranes (PhR&#697;P&#8211;BH2)&#160;in situ. These phosphinoboranes undergo subsequent reactivity to yield either polyphosphinoborane, [PhPH&#8211;BH2]n, or the linear dimer, Ph2PH&#8226;BH2&#8211;Ph2P&#8226;BH3. Unlike metal catalyzed phosphine&#8208;borane dehydrocoupling, which occurs at elevated temperatures (2 M, toluene, &#8805; 100 &#176;C, &#8805; 24 h), these dehydrocoupling reactions occur under ambient conditions (2 M, Et2O or C6D6, 20 &#176;C, &#8804; 24 h). We performed a computational mechanistic study in which we identified that this transformation potentially occurs&#160;via&#160;a P&#8208;to&#8208;N and B&#8208;to&#8208;B hydrogen transfer&#160;via&#160;a&#160;6&#8208;membered transition state.</dc:description>

         <title>Developing bio&#8208;carbon matrices for the encapsulation of silicon nanoparticles for high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion battery anode materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural coconut silk is employed to synthesize a CSC with hierarchical pore structure and rich oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups, which is used to compound with Si to obtain CSC/Si composite, and delivers decent electrochemical performances.







Abstract
Silicon (Si) is considered to be one of the most promising anode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries because of its abundant reserves, low discharge potential, and most importantly, its high theoretical specific capacity. However, the practical application of Si&#8208;based anodes is mainly hindered by the low intrinsic conductivity of Si and the large volume change upon lithiation/de&#8208;lithiation. In order to improve the electrochemical performance of Si&#8208;based anodes, we prepared a composite material consisting of Si nanoparticles (NPs) and coconut silk bio&#8208;carbon (CSC) skeleton. The porous carbon skeleton derived from coconut silk with natural through&#8208;holes and ample micropores on the wall, which was used as the carrier of Si NPs. The continuous through&#8208;holes and well&#8208;distributed oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups of the CSC provided sufficient space and abundant adsorption active sites for Si NPs, what&#8216;s more, the good dispersion of Si NPs in the through&#8208;holes increased their contact with the surrounding carbon materials, which was conducive to electron transport. Meanwhile, the pore structure also provided buffer space for the volume expansion of Si. The rich oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups can form a certain chemical force with silicon particles, and further stabilize the nano silicon particles.

&lt;p&gt;Natural coconut silk is employed to synthesize a CSC with hierarchical pore structure and rich oxygen-containing functional groups, which is used to compound with Si to obtain CSC/Si composite, and delivers decent electrochemical performances.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silicon (Si) is considered to be one of the most promising anode materials for next-generation lithium-ion batteries because of its abundant reserves, low discharge potential, and most importantly, its high theoretical specific capacity. However, the practical application of Si-based anodes is mainly hindered by the low intrinsic conductivity of Si and the large volume change upon lithiation/de-lithiation. In order to improve the electrochemical performance of Si-based anodes, we prepared a composite material consisting of Si nanoparticles (NPs) and coconut silk bio-carbon (CSC) skeleton. The porous carbon skeleton derived from coconut silk with natural through-holes and ample micropores on the wall, which was used as the carrier of Si NPs. The continuous through-holes and well-distributed oxygen-containing functional groups of the CSC provided sufficient space and abundant adsorption active sites for Si NPs, what&#8216;s more, the good dispersion of Si NPs in the through-holes increased their contact with the surrounding carbon materials, which was conducive to electron transport. Meanwhile, the pore structure also provided buffer space for the volume expansion of Si. The rich oxygen-containing functional groups can form a certain chemical force with silicon particles, and further stabilize the nano silicon particles. Hence, the CSC/Si electrode revealed an excellent capacity retention of 82.8&#8201;% at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 100 cycles. This study provides a simple universal high-throughput method to obtain anode materials with outstanding electrochemical properties and promotes the further development of Si/C composites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nucleophilic Triphenylgermanides of Magnesium and Calcium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of the dimeric alkaline earth hydrides, [(BDI)AeH]2 (BDI=HC{(Me)CNDipp}2; Dipp=2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3; Ae=Mg, Ca), with Ph3GeH in the presence of THF provide H2 and [(BDI)AeGePh3(THF)]. Although the synthesis of the magnesium derivative is complicated by THF ring opening, the calcium reagent is a viable source of the triphenylgermanide nucleophile.







Abstract
The dimeric calcium and magnesium hydrides, [(BDI)AeH]2 [BDI=HC{(Me)CNDipp}2, Dipp=2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3; Ae=Mg or Ca] do not react with Ph3GeH in non&#8208;coordinating solvent. Addition of THF, however, induces deprotonation and access to monomeric Ae&#8208;germanide complexes, [(BDI)Ae{GePh3}(THF)], both of which have been structurally characterized. Although this process is facile when Ae=Ca, the analogous magnesium&#8208;based reaction requires heating to temperatures &gt;100&#8201;&#176;C, under which conditions germanide formation is complicated by THF ring opening and the generation of an alkaline earth germyl&#8208;C&#8208;terminated n&#8208;butoxide, [(BDI)Mg{&#956;2&#8208;O(CH2)4GePh3}]. Reactions of [(BDI)Ca{GePh3}(THF)] with N,N&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;isopropylcarbodiimide and benzophenone provide the respective germylamidinate and germylalkoxide derivatives, [(BDI)Ca{(i&#8208;PrN)2CGePh3}(THF)] and [(BDI)Ca{OC(GePh3)Ph2}(THF)], demonstrating its potential as a well&#8208;defined and soluble source of the [Ph3Ge]&#8722; anion in nucleophilic addition reactions.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Thioglycosylated Monolignol Dual Probes for Bioimaging of Lignin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the design, synthesis, and application of thioglycosylated monolignol probes, functionalized for bioorthogonal labeling, to study lignin biosynthesis in plant cell walls. By incorporating stable sulfur&#8208;linked glycosides with clickable tags, we enable precise in&#8197;situ visualization of lignin through confocal fluorescence microscopy. Our results highlight unique insights into the spatial dynamics and roles of monolignol glucosides in lignification.







Abstract
Lignin biosynthesis is a critical process that underpins plant structural integrity and defenses. Central to this pathway are monolignol glucosides (MLGs), whose role as intermediates remains debated. To elucidate MLGs&#8217; involvement, we developed thioglycosylated monolignol probes compatible with click chemistry for in&#8197;situ visualization of lignin biosynthesis. Using a highly selective Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig&#8211;Migita cross&#8208;coupling approach, these probes incorporate glycosyl thiols into MLGs, creating stable thioacetal bonds to enhance both metabolic stability and tracking precision. The unique chemistry of these probes allows for incorporation within the lignification pathway, enabling specific visualization of MLG involvement in lignin formation. The probes are compatible with bioorthogonal chemistry labeling and confocal microscopy, allowing detailed tracking of MLG transport, storage, and incorporation into cell walls. Our findings provide new insights into lignification dynamics, underscoring the metabolic roles of MLGs and demonstrating their potential as metabolic intermediates in lignin polymerization. This approach offers a novel chemical biology toolset to dissect plant cell wall biosynthesis and will help elucidatethe molecular roles of MLGs in the context of plant biochemistry and resilience.

         <title>IPLOT&#8208;VKA: An Integral&#8208;Method Powell&#8208;pLOT&#8208;Enhanced Visual Kinetic Analysis for the Determination of Orders of Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods for the determination of partial orders of reaction have been surveyed and expanded. A free online application named IPLOT&#8208;VKA, after Integral&#8208;method Powell&#8208;pLOT&#8208;enhanced&#8208;Visual Kinetic Analysis, has been developed to speed up the determination of partial orders of reaction in chemical kinetics. Applications to classical teaching experiments and current literature in catalysis are reported.







Abstract
Determination of partial orders of reactions in kinetics is a general entry step for any mechanistic investigation; recently, considerable attention has been given to the benefits of using visual methods to help in this task, such as easy utilization and data&#8208;efficiency. In this respect, we here revisit and improve the classic method by Powell and Margerison for kinetic analysis. For the first time, analytical equations for a bimolecular reaction have been worked out for all values of partial orders of reactions, and the solutions have been implemented in a free, open&#8208;access and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use Web&#8208;application, named IPLOT&#8208;VKA, which also allows estimation of the errors on the kinetic constant, and residual standard error on concentrations. Several examples, taken from reference teaching experiences and from recent literature in catalysis show the efficacy and accuracy of our approach, which also has the advantage of requiring less experimental runs than other visual methods currently available.

         <title>Near&#8208;Quantitative Removal of Oxalate and Terephthalate from Water by Precipitation with a Rigid Bis&#8208;Amidinium Compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple precipitant removes oxalate and terephthalate from water and shows remarkable selectivity over other anions including halides, other polycarboxylates and sulfate. Once oxalate/terephthalate has been removed from water, the precipitant can be regenerated easily and effectively for subsequent re&#8208;use.







Abstract
A simple, readily&#8208;prepared precipitant (1&#8901;Cl2) precipitates oxalate or terephthalate from water with very high efficacy, removing these anions at sub&#8208;millimolar concentrations using only one equivalent of precipitant. A simple aqueous base/acid cycle can be used to regenerate 1&#8901;Cl2 after use. The resulting precipitates, 1&#8901;oxalate and 1&#8901;terephthalate, are anhydrous and closely&#8208;packed, with each anion receiving eight charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds from amidinium N&#8722;H donors. Precipitation of oxalate and terephthalate occurs at much lower concentrations than other dicarboxylates, and direct competition experiments with the biologically/environmentally relevant divalent anions CO32&#8722;, HPO42&#8722; and SO42&#8722; reveal very high selectivity for oxalate or terephthalate over these competitors.

         <title>Hydridostannylene Derivatives of Magnesium and Calcium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Reactions of [(2,6&#8208;Dipp2C6H3)Sn(&#956;&#8208;H)]2 (Dipp=2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3) with [(BDI)AeH]2 (BDI=HC{(Me)CNDipp}2; Ae=Mg, Ca) provide heterobimetallic bis&#8208;&#956;2&#8208;hydrido species, [[(BDI)Ae&#8208;&#956;&#8208;(H)2&#8208;Sn(C6H3&#8208;2,6&#8208;Dipp2)]. Although both compounds react with hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene to provide alkaline earth derivatives of tetravalent organostannides, the magnesium reagent promotes twofold addition of the alkene whereas the calcium&#8208;based reaction is arrested after a single hydrostannylation event.







Abstract
Reactions of a m&#8208;terphenylhydridostannylene with &#946;&#8208;diketiminato magnesium and calcium hydrides provide bis&#8208;&#956;2&#8208;hydrido species, the heterobimetallic constitutions of which are maintained after the addition of THF donor solvent. In both cases, reactions with hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene result in the formation of tetravalent organostannyl alkaline earth derivatives. Whereas the magnesium reagent undergoes facile twofold addition, the calcium&#8208;centered process is arrested after a single alkene reduction event. This contrasting behavior is assessed to result from the heavier alkaline earth element's ability to form a persistent polyhapto interaction with an arene substituent of the m&#8208;terphenyl ligand.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Hydrothermal Synthesis of Glucose&#8208;Induced Low Crystallinity NiCo&#8208;Based Layered Double Hydroxides for High&#8208;Performance Asymmetric Supercapacitors</title>

Supercapacitor electrodes: Glucose induced NiCo&#8208;based layered double hydroxides (NiCoLDH) to produce excellent electrode structure, thereby improving the electrochemical performance of supercapacitor.







Abstract
In order to improve the electrochemical performance of NiCo&#8208;based layered double hydroxide (NiCoLDH), the synthesis of low&#8208;crystallinity NiCoLDH was induced by the adsorption of glucose and NiCoLDH. The results showed that glucose could not only effectively regulate the pore structure and morphology of NiCoLDH, but also had a regular effect on crystallinity. Pure phase NiCoLDH had higher crystallinity. When the mass of glucose is 0.05&#8197;g, the prepared NiCoLDH&#8208;0.05 is a short&#8208;range ordered structure embedded in the amorphous matrix. The crystallinity of the product decreases further with the further increase of glucose mass. Since the ordered structures have higher electrical conductivity, and amorphous structures have more defects and active sites, the structure of NiCoLDH&#8208;0.05 is conducive to achieving the best electrochemical performance. Electrochemical test results show that NiCoLDH&#8208;0.05 has a high specific capacitance, about 12 times that of the pure phase NiCoLDH, the mass of glucose is higher than or below 0.05&#8197;g, the specific capacitance will be further reduced. NiCoLDH&#8208;0.05 and activated carbon assembled into an asymmetric supercapacitor have a power density of 400&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at an energy density of 32.7&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. This study provides a new idea for obtaining excellent electrochemical properties by adjusting LDH crystallinity.

         <title>An Ion Pair Receptor for Selective Solid&#8208;Liquid Extraction of LiCl</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ion pair receptor composed of a functionalized calix[4]arene and a calix[4]pyrrole unit extracts lithium chloride with high selectivity from a solid mixture of alkali metal chloride salts and releases it upon contact with water.







Abstract
We have synthesized a new ion pair receptor (2) consisting of a cone&#8208;calix[4]arene bearing a combination of ethyl esters and ethers as a cation binding site and a calix[4]pyrrole subunit acting as an anion binding site. Ion pair receptor 2 complexes LiCl, NaCl, and CsCl among alkali metal chloride salts with distinct complexation modes and affinities in 10&#8201;% methanol&#8208;d4 in chloroform&#8208;d. For instance, relatively small Li+ and Na+ cations are bound to the oxygen atoms of the functionalized calix[4]arene lower rim with Cl&#8722; being hydrogen bonded to the calix[4]pyrrole NHs while the larger Cs+ cation is bound to the cone&#8208;shaped calix[4]pyrrole cavity via a &#960;&#8208;cation interaction. By contrast, in the co&#8208;presence of all MCl salts (M=Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs), receptor 2 binds LiCl with complete selectivity. Besides, receptor 2 is capable of extracting LiCl selectively into a chloroform or a dichloromethane organic phase from its solid source containing all other MCl salts.

         <title>Enabling High&#8208;Performance Multi&#8208;Resonant TADF Emitters via Intramolecular Hydrogen Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green OLED based on BN&#8208;2Pm demonstrates EQEmax of 36.5% with CIE coordinates of (0.18, 0.71), while device employing BN&#8208;5Pm as emitting layer exhibits EQEmax of 14.6% with CIE coordinates of (0.12, 0.57). The magic difference in luminescence between the two isomers lies in the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bond.







Abstract
Hydrogen bonds (HBs), prevalent strong interactions in organic compounds, can effectively constrain single bond rotation, leading to rigid planar configurations. This rigidity enhances emission efficiency and narrows the emission spectrum of luminescent materials. Recent advances have leveraged HBs to advance high&#8208;performance donor&#8208;acceptor thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials. However, their application in multi&#8208;resonance (MR) TADF emitters remains limited. We herein developed MR&#8208;TADF emitters incorporating intramolecular hydrogen bonds (IHBs) with pyrimidine as the HB acceptor. The rigid planar conformation induced by IHBs significantly improved photoluminescence quantum yield, extended emission wavelength, reduced full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum, and decreased non&#8208;radiative decay rates for BN&#8208;2Pm compared to BN&#8208;5Pm. Devices based on BN&#8208;2Pm achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency of 36.5&#8201;%, a current efficiency of 102.3&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, a power efficiency of 84.6&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1, and Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.18, 0.71). In contrast, BN&#8208;5Pm exhibited lower values: 14.6&#8201;%, 36.8&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, 27.6&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1, and (0.12, 0.57), respectively.

         <title>Isolation of a Staudinger&#8208;type Intermediate Utilizing a Five&#8208;Membered Phosphorus&#8208;Centered Biradicaloid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trapping transient Staudinger&#8208;type intermediates. The reaction of five&#8208;membered biradicaloids with azides (e.&#8201;g.&#160;Dipp&#8208;N3) leads to a variety of reaction pathways. Staudinger&#8208;type intermediates can be isolated directly from the reaction mixture (without loss of N2) if specific time or temperature control is applied. SCXRD, low&#8208;temperature NMR studies and calculations help to understand under which conditions addition or Staudinger type reaction takes place.







Abstract
The Staudinger reaction provides chemists with a valuable tool for the reduction of azides, which are notoriously unstable and can decompose explosively. By providing a controlled method for the conversion of azides to amines, the reaction opened up new avenues for the synthesis of various amine&#8208;containing compounds that are widely used in natural products, pharmaceuticals and polymers. The Staudinger reaction begins with the nucleophilic attack of a trivalent phosphine (usually triphenylphosphine), leading to the formation of a triazenide intermediate, a highly reactive species. Here we report how a divalent phosphorus&#8208;centered biradicaloid reacts with covalent azides and show that it is possible to capture and fully characterize the transient intermediate. The experimental data is supported by quantum chemical calculations of the reaction paths and in terms of thermodynamics and chemical bonding.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trapping transient Staudinger-type intermediates&lt;/b&gt;. The reaction of five-membered biradicaloids with azides (e.&#8201;g.&#160;Dipp-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) leads to a variety of reaction pathways. Staudinger-type intermediates can be isolated directly from the reaction mixture (without loss of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) if specific time or temperature control is applied. SCXRD, low-temperature NMR studies and calculations help to understand under which conditions addition or Staudinger type reaction takes place.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Staudinger reaction provides chemists with a valuable tool for the reduction of azides, which are notoriously unstable and can decompose explosively. By providing a controlled method for the conversion of azides to amines, the reaction opened up new avenues for the synthesis of various amine-containing compounds that are widely used in natural products, pharmaceuticals and polymers. The Staudinger reaction begins with the nucleophilic attack of a trivalent phosphine (usually triphenylphosphine), leading to the formation of a triazenide intermediate, a highly reactive species. Here we report how a divalent phosphorus-centered biradicaloid reacts with covalent azides and show that it is possible to capture and fully characterize the transient intermediate. The experimental data is supported by quantum chemical calculations of the reaction paths and in terms of thermodynamics and chemical bonding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;Encapsulated NHCs: Increased Selectivity and Reactivity of CO2 in Amine Formylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The confinement of a N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) in cyclodextrins (CDs) allows the organocatalytic formylation of amines. The presence of a cavity enables substrate&#8208;selectivity, based on the steric bulk around the amine, without any loss of reactivity.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the confinement of a N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) organocatalyst in the cavity of cyclodextrins (CDs). These confined organocatalysts allow the formylation of amines through CO2 hydrosilylation. The presence of the cavity of the CDs leads to substrate&#8208;selectivity between amines in competition reactions. The use of the smallest &#945;&#8208;CD induces the best selectivities but also increased reactivity compared to the bigger &#946;&#8208;CD. A careful study conducted by NMR and DFT revealed that in &#945;&#8208;CD, the complexed CO2 interacts with the cavity through hydrogen bonds. These H&#8208;bonds destabilize the NHC&#8211;CO2 adduct and are accountable for the higher reactivity observed using &#945;&#8208;CD.

This study demonstrates how the coordination conformation of a tris&#8208;amine molecule built on a central benzene frame changes when multimetallated by a different set of alkali metals







Abstract
Literature on Group One organoelement chemistry is dominated by lithium, though sodium and potassium also feature prominently, whereas rubidium and caesium are rarely mentioned. With recent breakthroughs hinting that organoelement compounds of these two heavier metals can perform better than their lighter congeners in particular applications, important advantages could be missed unless complete sets of alkali metals are included in studies. Here, we report the synthesis and characterisation of a complete set of multi&#8208;alkali&#8208;metallated molecular compounds of the 1,3,5&#8208;tris[(4,6&#8208;dimethylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)aminomethyl]&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triethylbenzene framework. Made by deprotonating the framework N&#8722;H bonds by a suitable base, the set comprises six THF&#8208;solvated compounds, four of which are homometallic, either containing Li in a trinuclear structure or Na, K, and Rb in hexanuclear structures. Since deprotonation was incomplete with Cs, its homometallic compound is tetranuclear containing two un&#8208;metallated N&#8722;H bonds. A heterobimetallic trilithium&#8208;tricaesium hexanuclear compound was also obtained by using a bimetallic Li&#8722;Cs base for deprotonation. Such alkali&#8208;metallated frameworks are often precursors to other multimetallic frameworks with unique properties across different fields of science.

We developed, for the first time, reusable, efficient ligand&#8208;free iron&#8208;copper catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction involving a variety of aryl, heteroaryl halides (including chlorides, bromides, and iodides), and alkyl bromides with diverse aryl and aliphatic primary amides, conducted under solvent&#8208;minimized conditions. This economically competitive protocol offered the corresponding cross&#8208;coupling products, N&#8208;arylamides and N&#8208;alkylamides, in good to excellent yields with broad substrate scope (65 examples) and tolerance to several sensitive functionalities. A series of experiments, XPS, UV, CV, EPR, XRD, and radical clock experiments were performed to investigate the reaction mechanism. Furthermore, the in&#8208;vitro. study of synthesized products 3&#8201;ii, 3&#8201;xii, and 3&#8201;xxxx exhibited promising antibacterial and anticancer activities (MTT and Molecular Docking).

A series of experiments, including X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry (CV), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) were conducted to identify the oxidation state of active catalytic species and radical clock experiment was performed using a radical probe to investigate the reaction mechanism. Furthermore, we evaluated the antibacterial and anticancer properties of selected synthesized products (3&#8201;ii, 3&#8201;xii, and 3&#8201;xxxx) in&#8208;vitro.

         <title>Morphological Evolution of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks into Hedrite, Sheaf and Spherulite Superstructures with Localized Different Coloration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hyperbranched metal&#8208;organic superstructures reported here exhibit diverse morphologies, including hedrites, sheafs, and spherulites. These structures are formed via non&#8208;crystallographic branching, which represents a distinct growth mechanism typically observed in many materials and is being reported for the first time in metal&#8208;organic frameworks.







Abstract
The branched metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are the first superstructures of this kind, and the growth mechanism may explain crystal shapes of other materials. The mechanism of the formation of fascinating structures having a hedrite, sheaf or spherulite appearance are detailed. The branching can be controlled, resulting in crystals that either exhibit multiple generations of branching or a single generation. These structures might result from an increasing number of defects on fast&#8208;grown rods. As the basal facets become less reactive, material is added to the prism facets, leading to secondary nucleation and triangular branches. These triangular structures are connected to the rod surface, growing longer than the central rod. Electron diffraction analyses show that the sheafs are polycrystalline structures with their fantails consisting of single&#8208;crystalline nanorods deviating gradually from each other in their orientation. The crystallographic structure consists of channels with opposite handedness. The accessibility of the nanochannels and the porosity of the superstructures are demonstrated by chromophore diffusion into the channels. The confinement and alignment of the chromophores inside the channels resulted in polarized&#8208;light dependent coloration of the crystals; the polycrystallinity generated areas having different optical properties.

         <title>Exploring Benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]benzothiophene S&#8208;Oxides for Organic Electronics, Fluorescence&#8208;Based Applications, and Asymmetric Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]benzothiophene&#160;S&#8208;oxides has been efficiently synthesized via one&#8208; or two&#8208;step selective oxidation of benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]benzothiophene (BTBT). These BTBT&#160;S&#8208;oxides form highly ordered structures that display optical anisotropy, are thermally stable up to temperatures above 210 oC, and do not show phase transitions. They exhibit long excited state lifetimes (0.181&#8211;0.869 ms) and are more resistant to oxidative degradation than their parent unoxidized BTBT. Some of these compounds demonstrate high quantum yields, exceeding 98% in solution and 71% in the solid state. As evidenced by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, BTBT&#8208;based sulfoxides have sufficiently high pyramidal inversion energy barriers that prevent their stereomutation at room temperature. Additionally, fully S&#8208;oxidized BTBT meets the energy&#8208;splitting criterion required for the singlet fission process, with the T1 energy level that makes it suitable for device application.</dc:description>

         <title>Sn(IV) Complexes of 5,10,15,20&#8208;Tetraaryl&#8208;5,15&#8208;diazaporphyrinoids: A Promising Platform for Evaluating the 20&#960;&#8208;Electron Antiaromaticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porphyrinoids in the 20&#960;&#8208;electron state have been extensively studied from the fundamental viewpoint of investigating their structure&#8211;antiaromaticity relationships. However, most of the 20&#960; porphyrinoids are highly distorted and unstable in air, which hinder the comprehensive analysis of paratropic ring&#8208;current effects derived from planar &#960;&#8208;electron systems. Herein, we present the first examples of antiaromatic Sn(IV) complexes of 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraaryl&#8208;5,15&#8208;diazaporphyrinoids (SnX2TADAPs), prepared by the complexation of the corresponding freebases with Sn(II) chloride under aerobic conditions and subsequent metathesis of the axial ligands, that show paratropic ring&#8208;current effects. Notably, both neutral 20&#960;&#8208;electron derivatives and 19&#960;&#8208;electron radical cations of SnX2TADAP are extremely stable in air owing to the intrinsic electronic effects of the central Sn(IV) unit and meso nitrogen atoms. NMR spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and density functional theory calculations were performed to assess the ring&#8208;current effects and orbital energies of a series of the 20&#960;&#8208;electron SnX2TADAPs, and the results reveal that the paratropic ring&#8208;current effects arising from the planar 20&#960;&#8208;electron DAP ring increases with a decrease in the HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photolockable Polyaromatic Capsule Designed via Regiochemical Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new bent amphiphile featuring two 2&#8208;substituted anthracene panels, designed via the regiochemical substitution of a previous bent amphiphile with 9&#8208;substituted panels, quantitatively assembles into a well&#8208;defined polyaromatic capsule in water with improved host ability. Upon short light irradiation, the capsule and its host&#8208;guest composites undergo efficient intermolecular [4+4] photo&#8208;oligomerization in water, without release of the bound guests.







Abstract
Photocontrol over host frameworks is an elegant way to manipulate host&#8208;guest composites, yet the majority of previous systems suffer from long irradiation time and narrow guest scope, and are restricted to intramolecular photoreactions in organic solvents. Herein we present a photolockable polyaromatic capsule with high guest binding abilities in water. The capsule assembles from bent amphiphiles featuring two 2&#8208;subsutituted anthracene panels, which shows high stability against dilution and undergoes intermolecular [4+4] photo&#8208;oligomerization upon short light irradiation (&lt;10&#8197;min). The photolocked capsule provides a roughly spherical framework, with an average, core diameter of ~3&#8197;nm, composed of amphiphilic oligomers (e.&#8201;g., trimer). The new capsule shows improved host ability (up to 10&#8208;fold) in water toward various hydrophobic compounds (e.&#8201;g., organic and metal&#8208;complex dyes), as compared with an analogous, non&#8208;photolockable capsule with 9&#8208;subsutituted anthracene panels. In addition, the resultant dye&#8208;loaded capsules are also successfully photolocked via short irradiation with high retention of the bound dyes.

         <title>Photocatalytic CeCl3&#8208;Promoted C&#8722;H Alkenylation and Alkynylation of Alkanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An indirect HAT&#8208;mediated photocatalytic protocol is developed, using a cerium salt (CeCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;7H2O) and a chlorine source (TBACl) as the catalytic system. A variety of cyclic and linear hydrocarbons are utilized, delivering the corresponding alkenylation or alkynylation products in good to high yields, displaying high regioselectivity under 390 nm irradiation.







Abstract
The reemerging field of photoredox catalysis offers numerous advantages towards the development of novel, sustainable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;execute organic transformations. Herein, we report a light&#8208;triggered application of cerium complexes towards the C&#8722;H alkenylation and alkynylation of alkanes. An indirect HAT&#8208;mediated photocatalytic protocol was developed, using a cerium salt (CeCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;7H2O) and a chlorine source (TBACl) as the catalytic system. A variety of cyclic and linear hydrocarbons were utilized, delivering the corresponding alkenylation or alkynylation products in good to high yields, displaying high regioselectivity. A series of mechanistic experiments were conducted.
