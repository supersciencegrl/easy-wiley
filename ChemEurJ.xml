         <title>Tetrasubstituted Peropyrenes Formed by Reductive Aromatization: Synthesis, Functionalization and Characterization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chromophore class of 1,3,8,10&#8208;tetrasubstituted peropyrenes was effectively synthesized from peropyrenequinone via a Zn&#8208;mediated reductive aromatization approach. In one step, a symmetric functionalization of the peropyrene backbone introducing silylethers (  2  ,  3  ), pivaloyl (  4  ), triflyl (  5  ) and also phosphinite (  6  ) groups was established. Furthermore, the potential of using  4  and  5  in transition metal catalyzed cross couplings was explored leading to 1,3,8,10&#8208;tetraaryl (  8  &#8208;  11  ) and tetraalkynyl (  7  ) peropyrenes. The influence of various substituents on the optoelectronic properties of these &#960;&#8208;system extended peropyrenes was investigated in solid state by means of X&#8208;ray crystallography, in solution by means of UV&#8208;Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and by their redox properties studied via cyclic voltammetry. By comparison with DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations, it could be elucidated that introduction of a broad variety of substituents in such versatile one or two step procedures leads to peropyrenes with easily tunable HOMO and LUMO energies ranging in a gap window of 0.8 eV. The frontier molecular orbital energies identify the target molecules as promising candidates for hole transporting semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphorus&#8208;containing Superbases: Recent Progress in the Chemistry of Electron&#8208;abundant Phosphines and Phosphazenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The renaissance of Br&#248;nsted superbases is primarily based on their pronounced capability for a large variety of chemical transformations under mild reaction conditions. Four major set screws are available for the selective tuning of the basicity: the nature of the basic center (N, P, &#8230;), the degree of electron donation by substituents to the central atom, the possibility of charge delocalization, and the energy gain by hydrogen bonding. Within the past decades, a plethora of neutral electron&#8208;rich phosphine and phosphazene bases appeared in the literature. Their outstanding properties and advantages over inorganic or charged bases have made them now indispensable as auxiliary bases in deprotonation processes. Also, their utilization in catalysis or as ligands in coordination chemistry is highlighted due to broad&#8208;spread interest. Here we give an update of the chemistry of basic phosphines and phosphazenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis and Bioactivity Mapping of Geodiamolide H</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first total synthesis of the actin&#8208;stabilizing marine natural product geodiamolide H was achieved. Solid&#8208;phase based peptide assembly paired with scalable stereoselective syntheses of polyketide building blocks and an optimized esterification set the stage for investigating the key ring&#8208;closing metathesis. Geodiamolide H and synthetic analogs were characterized for their toxicity and for antiproliferative effects in cellulo, by characterising actin polymerization induction in vitro, and by docking on the F&#8208;actin target and property computation in silico, for a better understanding of structure&#8208;activity relationships (SAR). A non&#8208;natural analog of geodiamolide H was discovered to be most potent in the series, suggesting significant potential for tool compound design.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of Bicontinuous Cubic Phase and its Two&#8208;sided Nature Produced by Use of Siloxane Tails and Introduction of Molecular Nonsymmetry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A recent intriguing finding that a helical network arrangement forms the bicontinuous cubic phase is attracting great attention for its possibility for new routes to asymmetric synthesis by achiral molecules. However, the design of the molecular structure for the cubic phase is still unrevealed. Herein, we show that a nonsymmetric core molecule with larger naphthalene and smaller benzene moieties at each side of the central linkage and the same disiloxanyldecyloxy terminal at both terminals is the first example for forming both single&#8208;layered and double&#8208;layered core assembly modes in the  Ia  3  d  phase as a single molecule system. The molecule forms the former mode at high temperatures as a thermodynamically stable phase, similarly to the symmetric naphthalene core system, whereas, on cooling below a temperature (&#8764;350 K), a metastable  Ia  3  d  phase forms a double&#8208;layered core state down to room temperature, which is common to the benzene core system. As another effect of the nonsymmetric core, the cubic phase is maintained at room temperature for more than 100 days with slight distortion. Infrared spectral studies and quantum chemical calculations suggested the easy transformation between the two core assembly modes. The core nonsymmetry can be a versatile fine&#8208;tuning of the core assembly mode and phase stability for the cubic phase molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Soluble Congeners of Prior Insoluble Shape&#8208;Persistent Imine Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chains make the difference! By attaching three n&#8208;hexyloxy chains to a triptycene triamine precursor, various soluble [4+4] and [4+6] imine cages were synthesized that were prior insoluble, revealing detailed insights in cage formation and exchange mechanisms by NMR spectroscopy in combination with gel permeation chromatography. The cubic [4+4] cage once formed is extraordinarily stable against exchange, although it is a clear thermodynamically controlled product.







Abstract
One of the most applied reaction types to synthesize shape&#8208;persistent organic cage compounds is the imine condensation reaction and it is assumed that the formed cages are thermodynamically controlled products due to the reversibility of the imine condensation. However, most of the synthesized imine cages reported are formed as precipitate from the reaction mixture and therefore rather may be kinetically controlled products. There are even examples in literature, where resulting cages are not soluble at all in common organic solvents to characterize or study their formation by NMR spectroscopy in solution. Here, a triptycene triamine containing three solubilizing n&#8208;hexyloxy chains has been used to synthesize soluble congeners of prior insoluble cages. This allowed us to study the formation as well as the reversibility of cage formation in solution by investigating exchange of building blocks between the cages and deuterated derivatives thereof.

The enantioselective reaction required only 0.5 mol % chiral peptide&#8208;catalyst in the presence of  i  Pr  2  EtN (2.5 equiv), and gave a 1,4&#8208;adduct with 93% ee of an 85% yield. As Michael acceptors, various &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene derivatives such as methyl,  p  &#8208;fluoro,  p  &#8208;bromo, and  p  &#8208;methoxy substituents on the phenyl group, 2&#8208;furyl, 2&#8208;thiophenyl, and naphthyl &#946;&#8208;nitroethylenes could be applied. Furthermore, various alkyl malonates and cyclic &#946;&#8208;keto&#8208;esters could be used as Michael donors.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heptazine&#8208;based microporous polymeric network, HMP&#8208;TAPA was synthesized via direct coupling of trichloroheptazine and tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl)amine (TAPA). The high surface area of 424 m  2  /g was achieved which is the highest surface area among heptazine&#8208;based polymeric networks (HMPs). The tailored electron&#8208;donor and acceptor units in HMP&#8208;TAPA render the broad visible light absorption. HMP&#8208;TAPA was employed as metal&#8208;free photocatalyst for oxidative coupling of amines to imines under visible light irradiation with 98% selectivity. Furthermore, the surface basicity of HMP&#8208;TAPA was utilized to achieve metal&#8208;free heterogeneous base catalysis for Knoevenagel condensation under base&#8208;free conditions with &gt;99 % conversion. Furthermore, HMP&#8208;TAPA showed extreme robustness over a wide pH range (1&#8208;14). The versatility and flexibility in the current material design is beneficial for understanding the offered photo&#8208;activity and surface basicity to design dual active (photo) catalyst materials for specific applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Simple Amides and Amines for the Synergistic Recovery of Rhodium from Hydrochloric Acid by Solvent Extraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic combination of a simple primary amine (LA) and a simple primary amide (L1) is shown to extract rhodium from hydrochloric acid. A range of experimental and computational techniques are used to elucidate the structures of two different complexes in the organic phase; the ion&#8208;pair [HLA]3[RhCl6] and the amide complex [HLA]2[RhCl5(L1)]. In the latter complex, the amide is tautomerized to its enol form and coordinated through the nitrogen atom.







Abstract
The separation and isolation of many of the platinum group metals (PGMs) is currently achieved commercially using solvent extraction processes. The extraction of rhodium is problematic however, as a variety of complexes of the form [RhCln(H2O)6&#8208;n](n&#8722;3)&#8722; are found in hydrochloric acid, making it difficult to design a reagent that can extract all the rhodium. In this work, the synergistic combination of a primary amine (2&#8208;ethylhexylamine, LA) with a primary amide (3,5,5&#8208;trimethylhexanamide, L1) is shown to extract over 85&#8201;% of rhodium from 4&#8197;M hydrochloric acid. Two rhodium complexes are shown to reside in the organic phase, the ion&#8208;pair [HLA]3[RhCl6] and the amide complex [HLA]2[RhCl5(L1)]; in the latter complex, the amide is tautomerized to its enol form and coordinated to the rhodium centre through the nitrogen atom. This insight highlights the need for ligands that target specific metal complexes in the aqueous phase and provides an efficient synergistic solution for the solvent extraction of rhodium.

         <title>Indium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;F Bond Transformation through Oxymetalation/&#946;&#8208;Fluorine Elimination to Access Fluorinated Isocoumarins</title>

&#8220;The DFT calculation results revealed an attractive characteristic of indium atoms with fluorine atoms. These significant results show that indium salts act as a &#960;&#8208;Lewis activator of gem&#8208;difluoroalkene and smoothly abstract fluoride thanks to an affinity toward fluorine atoms. In indium chemistry, few results of C&#8722;F bond functionalization have been established. We achieved both indium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;F bond functionalization and the first synthesis of monofluorinated isocoumarin at the 3&#8208;position.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff.

         <title>Metal&#8208;free Deoxygenation of Chiral Nitroalkanes: an Easy Entry to &#945;&#8722;substituted Enantiomerically Enriched Nitriles.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A metal&#8208;free, mild and chemodivergent transformation involving nitroalkanes was developed. Under optimized reaction conditions, in the presence of trichlorosilane and a tertiary amine, aliphatic nitroalkanes have been selectively converted into amines or nitriles. Furthermore, when chiral &#946;&#8208;substituted nitro compounds were reacted, the stereochemical integrity of the stereocenter was maintained and &#945;&#8722;functionalized nitriles were obtained with no loss in enantiomeric excess. The methodology was successfully applied to the synthesis of chiral &#946;&#8208;cyano esters, &#945;&#8208;aryl alkylnitriles, and TBS&#8208;protected cyanohydrins, including direct precursors of four APIs (Ibuprofen, Tembamide, Aegeline and Denopamine).</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclopentadienone Derivative Dimers as Tunable Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 29, Page 7882-7886, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of novel photoswitches based on a cyclopentadienone derivative dimer was synthesized. Their photoswitching properties were investigated.







Abstract
A series of photoswitchable cyclopentadienone derivative dimers bearing bromo, thienyl, 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)phenyl, 3&#8208;pyridinyl, 4&#8208;nitrophenyl and cyano groups was designed and facilely synthesized. Photoswitching properties such as the photoconversions in the photostationary state (PSS), the thermal kinetics and thermal half&#8208;lives of photoisomers were systematically investigated. These photoswitches show high fatigue resistance and large photoconversions in the PSS. This work proves that the photoswitching properties of photoswitches based on cyclopentadienone dimers can be tuned by substitution groups and also pave the way to functionalize the cyclopentadienone derivative dimer&#8208;based photoswitch, which is important for its future applications.

     alt="Cyclopentadienone Derivative Dimers as Tunable Photoswitches"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A series of novel photoswitches&lt;/b&gt; based on a cyclopentadienone derivative dimer was synthesized. Their photoswitching properties were investigated.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of photoswitchable cyclopentadienone derivative dimers bearing bromo, thienyl, 4-(dimethylamino)phenyl, 3-pyridinyl, 4-nitrophenyl and cyano groups was designed and facilely synthesized. Photoswitching properties such as the photoconversions in the photostationary state (PSS), the thermal kinetics and thermal half-lives of photoisomers were systematically investigated. These photoswitches show high fatigue resistance and large photoconversions in the PSS. This work proves that the photoswitching properties of photoswitches based on cyclopentadienone dimers can be tuned by substitution groups and also pave the way to functionalize the cyclopentadienone derivative dimer-based photoswitch, which is important for its future applications.&lt;/p&gt;

A divine sage: The potent KOR agonist (&#8722;)&#8208;salvinorin A was synthesized in only sixteen steps by modification of our previous route to the racemic title compound. Transition to asymmetric synthesis succeeded by a highly enantioselective propargylation to install the stereogenic center at C&#8208;12. Shortening of the original reaction sequence by two steps was finally achieved using a chemoselective Mitsunobu esterification of a cyclic syn 1,2&#8208;diol. Furthermore, an alternative intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder strategy employing a 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene moiety was investigated.







Abstract
A concise enantioselective total synthesis of the neoclerodane diterpene (&#8722;)&#8208;salvinorin A is reported. The stereogenic center at C&#8208;12 was installed by catalytic asymmetric propargylation with excellent enantioselectivity, and the remaining six stereogenic centers were set up highly diastereoselectively under substrate control. As for our previous synthesis of racemic salvinorin A, two intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder reactions were applied to generate the tricyclic core. A chemoselective Mitsunobu inversion of a syn 1,2&#8208;diol allowed for further streamlining of the original reaction sequence by two steps. Overall, (&#8722;)&#8208;salvinorin A was synthesized in only 16 steps starting from 3&#8208;furaldehyde with 1.4&#8201;% total yield. Furthermore, an alternative intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder strategy employing a 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene moiety was investigated.

         <title>Intertwined Analytical, Experimental and Theoretical Studies on the Formation and Structure of a Copper Dienolate</title>

         <dc:description>
An intertwined analytical, experimental and theoretical study disclose the mechanism of formation of an organocopper dienolate reagent from its silylated precursor. The study shed light on the Cu(II) to Cu(I) reduction process, the Si to Cu exchange mechanism and finally the metallotropic equilibrium of the resulting copper dienolate.







Abstract
The reaction of a silyl dienolate, a Cu(II) salt and TBAT yielding the corresponding copper dienolate is addressed. A combined NMR and cyclic voltammetry analysis first highlight the role of TBAT in the Cu(II) to Cu(I) reduction and the structure of the precatalytic species. From these first results a second set of NMR and theoretical studies enable the determination of the structure and the mechanism of formation of the copper dienolate catalytic species. Finally, we showed that that the copper catalyst promote the E/Z s&#8208;cis/s&#8208;trans equilibration of the silyl dienolate precursor through a copper dienolate intermediate. All of these results unveil some peculiarities of the catalytic and asymmetric vinylogous Mukaiyama reaction.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Fluorescent Helicene&#8208;Boranils: Synthesis, Photophysical and Chiroptical Properties</title>

Helicene&#8208;mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;boranils have been prepared in enantiopure forms. The chiroptical (electronic circular dichroism and optical rotation) and photophysical properties (unpolarized and circularly polarized luminescence) of these new chiral emissive helicenes have been studied both experimentally and theoretically and highlight their combined helical and axial chirality effects.







Abstract
Mono&#8208; and di&#8208;boranil&#8208;substituted helicenes were prepared by BF2&#8208;borylation of the corresponding anils, readily synthesized by condensation of 2&#8208;amino&#8208; and 2,15&#8208;diamino&#8208;helicenes with 4&#8208;(diethylamino)salicylaldehyde. After enantiomeric resolution using HPLC, their chiroptical properties including circularly polarized fluorescence in solution and in PMMA films were investigated and rationalized with the help of NMR, X&#8208;ray and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations.

Daucenol Synthase (DcS) from Streptomyces venezuelae was redirected using substrate analogues with additional, shifted, or lacking methyl groups to yield molecules from a naturally difficult to access chemical space, and improved in its catalytic efficiency through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis of surface residues, turning DcS into a high yielding biocatalyst.







Abstract
The dauc&#8208;8&#8208;en&#8208;11&#8208;ol synthase from Streptomyces venezuelae was investigated for its catalytic activity towards alternative terpene precursors, specifically designed to enable new cyclisation pathways. Exchange of aromatic amino acid residues at the enzyme surface by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis led to a 4&#8208;fold increase of the yield in preparative scale incubations, which likely results from an increased enzyme stability instead of improved enzyme kinetics.

         <title>Supramolecular Coordination Cages Based on N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Gold(I) Ligands and Their Precursors: Self&#8208;Assembly, Structural Transformation and Guest&#8208;Binding Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 29, Page 7853-7861, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a trackable CpZr&#8208;involved cage to cage conversion to generate heteroleptic V2E3 cages from two homoleptic cages with different geometries of V2E3 and V4E6. The heteroleptic assembly can also be formed by ligand displacement transformations from homoleptic assembly.







Abstract
The incorporation of functional groups into the cavity of discrete supramolecular coordination cages (SCCs) will bring unique functions and applications. Here, three dicarboxylate ligands (H2L1Cl, H2L2Cl and H2L3Cl) containing N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) precursors as linkers were introduced to construct SCCs by combining with two C3&#8208;symmertic (CpZr)3(&#956;3&#8208;O)(&#956;2&#8208;OH)3 clusters as three&#8208;connect vertices, resulted in a series of rugby&#8208;like V2E3 (V=vertex, E=edge) type homoleptic cages (SCC&#8208;1, SCC&#8208;2 and SCC&#8208;3). However, V4E6&#8208;type tetrahedral cages (SCC&#8208;4 and SCC&#8208;5), incorporating six Au&#8208;NHC moieties, were obtained when the corresponding NHC&#8208;gold(I) functionalized ligands (H2L1Au, H2L2Au) were applied. For the first time, we present a trackable CpZr&#8208;involved cage to cage conversion to generate a heteroleptic V2E3 cage (SCC&#8208;6) from two homoleptic cages (SCC&#8208;2 and SCC&#8208;5) with different geometries of V2E3 and V4E6. The heteroleptic assembly SCC&#8208;6 can also be formed upon a subcomponent displacement strategy. The structural transformation and reassembly processes were detected and monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy and electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry. The formation of heteroleptic assembly was further supported by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Moreover, homoleptic cage SCC&#8208;2 possesses a trigonal bipyramidal cationic cavity allowing the encapsulation of a series of sulfonate anionic guests.

Photochemistry. A facile, mild and metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot protocol for the activation of aromatic aldehydes and their conversion into amides, hydroxamic acids and esters was developed, using cheap household lamps as the light source and thioxanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one as the photocatalyst.







Abstract
A cheap, facile and metal&#8208;free photochemical protocol for the activation of aromatic aldehydes has been developed. Utilizing thioxanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one as the photocatalyst and cheap household lamps as the light source, a variety of aromatic aldehydes have been activated and subsequently converted in a one&#8208;pot reaction into amides, hydroxamic acids and esters in good to high yields. The applicability of this method was highlighted in the synthesis of Moclobemide, a drug against depression and social anxiety. Extended and detailed mechanistic studies have been conducted, in order to determine a plausible mechanism for the reaction.

         <title>On the Reactivity Enhancement of Graphene by Metallic Substrates towards Aryl Nitrene Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 29, Page 7887-7896, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The covalent functionalization of pristine graphene activated by metal substrates towards nitrenes is presented. Observed rate constants reveal that graphene supported on Ni (G/Ni) has the highest reactivity towards nitrenes, followed by G/Cu and then G/silicon wafer. DFT results indicate that increased charge transfer to graphene contribute to the higher reactivity with G/Ni. These results suggest that substrate activation represents an effective and novel strategy for functionalizing graphene using nitrenes potentially extending to other electron deficient reactants.







Abstract
Pristine graphene is fairly inert chemically, and as such, most application&#8208;driven studies use graphene oxide, or reduced graphene oxide. Using substrates to modulate the reactivity of graphene represents a unique strategy in the covalent functionalization of this otherwise fairly inert material. It was found that the reactivity of pristine graphene towards perfluorophenyl azide (PFPA) can be enhanced by a metal substrate on which graphene is supported. Results on the extent of functionalization, defect density, and reaction kinetics all show that graphene supported on Ni (G/Ni) has the highest reactivity toward PFPA, followed by G/Cu and then G/silicon wafer. DFT calculations suggest that the metal substrate stabilizes the physisorbed nitrene through enhanced electron transfer to the singlet nitrene from the graphene surface assisted by the electron rich metal substrate. The G/Ni substantially stabilizes the singlet nitrene relative to G/Cu and the free&#8208;standing graphene. The product structure is also predicted to be substrate dependent. These findings open up opportunities to enhance the reactivity of pristine graphene simply through the selection of the substrate. This also represents a new and powerful approach to increasing the reactivity of singlet nitrenes through direct electronic communication with graphene.

         <title>N&#8208;Doped Porous Carbon Derived from Solvent&#8208;Free Synthesis of Cross&#8208;Linked Triazine Polymers for Simultaneously Achieving CO2 Capture and Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 29, Page 7908-7914, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high surface area and high nitrogen content porous carbon was obtained by the rational design and pyrolysis of cross&#8208;linked triazine polymers. Such porous carbon as a CO2 adsorbent, exhibits a high CO2 adsorption capability at 5.67&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298.15&#8197;K and excellent stability. As an anode for supercapacitors, it delivers A&#8201;good specific capacitance of 158.8&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
It is highly desirable to design advanced heteroatomic doped porous carbon for wide application. Herein, N&#8208;doped porous carbon (NPC) was developed via the fabrication of high nitrogen cross&#8208;linked triazine polymers followed by pyrolysis and activation with controllable porous structure. The as&#8208;synthesized NPC at the pyrolysis temperature of 700&#8201;&#176;C possessed rich nitrogen content (up to 11.51&#8201;%) and high specific surface area (1353&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), which led to a high CO2 adsorption capability at 5.67&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298.15&#8197;K and 5&#8197;bar pressure and excellent stability. When the activation temperature was at 600&#8201;&#176;C, such NPC exhibited a superior electrochemical performance as anode for supercapacitors with a specific capacitance of 158.8 and 113&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 in 6&#8197;M KOH at a current density of 1 and 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively. Notably, it delivered an excellent stability with capacity retention of 97.4&#8201;% at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1after 6000 cycles.

1&#8208;Phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornenes (PAN) are shown to be suitable starting materials for novel bridged 7&#8208;membered phosphorus heterocycles (using lithium aluminium hydride as reducing agent) or lithium phospholide (with elemental lithium as reducing agent).

Abstract
The reduction of the 1&#8208;phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornene derivate endo&#8208;1 with lithium aluminium hydride leads to an unprecedented 1&#8208;phosphabicyclo[3.2.1]octa&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene, while a phospholide anion is formed with lithium. The latter can be protonated resulting in formation of an unusual 2H&#8208;phosphole dimer. Furthermore, 3H&#8208;phospholes, previously assumed to have no synthetic relevance as intermediates, were proposed to act as dienophile in the dimerisation of 3,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1&#8208;phenylphosphole at elevated temperatures based on theoretical calculations.

         <title>Structural Insights into the Molecular Recognition Mechanism of the Cancer and Pathogenic Epitope, LacdiNAc by Immune&#8208;Related Lectins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 29, Page 7951-7958, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular determinants that govern the binding of the tumour and pathogenic LacdiNAc (LDN) epitope by two human lectins, hGal&#8208;3 and hMGL, including the comparison with the natural LacNAc (LN) epitope, were unveiled. These findings are essential for chemical designing mimetics to selective target hGal&#8208;3 and hMGL.







Abstract
Interactions of glycan&#8208;specific epitopes to human lectin receptors represent novel immune checkpoints for investigating cancer and infection diseases. By employing a multidisciplinary approach that combines isothermal titration calorimetry, NMR spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and X&#8208;ray crystallography, we investigated the molecular determinants that govern the recognition of the tumour and pathogenic glycobiomarker LacdiNAc (GalNAc&#946;1&#8208;4GlcNAc, LDN), including their comparison with the ubiquitous LacNAc epitope (Gal&#946;1&#8208;4GlcNAc, LN), by two human immune&#8208;related lectins, galectin&#8208;3 (hGal&#8208;3) and the macrophage galactose C&#8208;type lectin (hMGL). A different mechanism of binding and interactions was observed for the hGal&#8208;3/LDN and hMGL/LDN complexes, which explains the remarkable difference in the binding specificity of LDN and LN by these two lectins. The new structural clues reported herein are fundamental for the chemical design of mimetics targeting hGal&#8208;3/hMGL recognition process.

         <title>Glycerol as a Substrate and Inactivator of Coenzyme B12&#8208;Dependent Diol Dehydratase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 29, Page 7930-7941, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two distinct enzymes, coenzyme B12&#8208;dependent diol dehydratase (B12&#8208;dDDH) and coenzyme B12&#8208;independent glycerol dehydratase (B12&#8208;iGDH), are capable of catalyzing the selective transformation of glycerol to 3&#8208;hydroxypropionaldehyde. Only the former enzyme is subject to substrate&#8208;induced inactivation, however. Utilizing molecular dynamics (MD), quantum mechanical (QM), and hybrid QM/MM techniques, we found that inactivation in B12&#8208;dDDH occurs if hydrogen abstraction takes place from the &#8216;wrong&#8217; side (C3) of glycerol.







Abstract
Diol dehydratase, dependent on coenzyme B12 (B12&#8208;dDDH), displays a peculiar feature of being inactivated by its native substrate glycerol (GOL). Surprisingly, the isofunctional enzyme, B12&#8208;independent glycerol dehydratase (B12&#8208;iGDH), does not undergo suicide inactivation by GOL. Herein we present a series of QM/MM and MD calculations aimed at understanding the mechanisms of substrate&#8208;induced suicide inactivation in B12&#8208;dDDH and that of resistance of B12&#8208;iGDH to inactivation. We show that the first step in the enzymatic transformation of GOL, hydrogen abstraction, can occur from both ends of the substrate (either C1 or C3 of GOL). Whereas C1 abstraction in both enzymes leads to product formation, C3 abstraction in B12&#8208;dDDH results in the formation of a low energy radical intermediate, which is effectively trapped within a deep well on the potential energy surface. The long lifetime of this radical intermediate likely enables its side reactions, leading to inactivation. In B12&#8208;iGDH, by comparison, C3 abstraction is an endothermic step; consequently, the resultant radical intermediate is not of low energy, and the reverse process of reforming the reactant is possible.

         <title>d/f&#8208;Polypnictides Derived by Non&#8208;Classical Ln2+ Compounds: Synthesis, Small Molecule Activation and Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 29, Page 7862-7871, May 20, 2021. </description>

Six new d/f&#8208;polyphosphides or d/f&#8208;polyarsenides, [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)] [Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Ln(E5)FeCp*] (Ln=La, Ce, Nd; E=P, As), were obtained by usage of non&#8208;classical divalent lanthanide compounds as reducing agents. While their optical properties were investigated by fs&#8208;spectroscopy, their reactivity was studied by P4 activation. The latter resulted in a selective expansion of the P5 rings ([K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)] [Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Ln(P7)FeCp*] (Ln=La, Nd)).







Abstract
Reduction chemistry induced by divalent lanthanides has been primarily focused on samarium so far. In light of the rich physical properties of the lanthanides, this limitation to one element is a drawback. Since molecular divalent compounds of almost all lanthanides have been available for some time, we used one known and two new non&#8208;classical reducing agents of the early lanthanides to establish a sophisticated reduction chemistry. As a result, six new d/f&#8208;polyphosphides or d/f&#8208;polyarsenides, [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)] [Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Ln(E5)FeCp*] (Ln=La, Ce, Nd; E=P, As) were obtained. Their reactivity was studied by activation of P4, resulting in a selective expansion of the P5 rings. The obtained compounds [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)] [Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Ln(P7)FeCp*] (Ln=La, Nd) are the first examples of an activation of P4 by a f&#8208;element&#8208;polypnictide complex. Additionally, the first systematic femtosecond (fs)&#8208;spectroscopy investigations of d/f&#8208;polypnictides are presented to showcase the advantages of having access to a broader series of lanthanide compounds.

         <title>Photoinduced Electron vs. Concerted Proton Electron Transfer Pathways in SnIV (l&#8208;Tryptophanato)2 Porphyrin Conjugates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 29, Page 7872-7881, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoinduced electron transfer (ET) or concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer (CPET) occur in tin(IV) porphyrin&#8208;tryptophan conjugates in dichloromethane in the presence of an organic base depending on the chromophore identity and spin multiplicity of the excited state which point out how peculiar the l&#8208;tryptophan amino acid is with respect to charge transfer reactions.







Abstract
Aromatic amino acids such as l&#8208;tyrosine and l&#8208;tryptophan are deployed in natural systems to mediate electron transfer (ET) reactions. While tyrosine oxidation is always coupled to deprotonation (proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer, PCET), both ET&#8208;only and PCET pathways can occur in the case of the tryptophan residue. In the present work, two novel conjugates 1 and 2, based on a SnIV tetraphenylporphyrin and SnIV octaethylporphyrin, respectively, as the chromophore/electron acceptor and l&#8208;tryptophan as electron/proton donor, have been prepared and thoroughly characterized by a combination of different techniques including single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. The photophysical investigation of 1 and 2 in CH2Cl2 in the presence of pyrrolidine as a base shows that different quenching mechanisms are operating upon visible&#8208;light excitation of the porphyrin component, namely photoinduced electron transfer and concerted proton electron transfer (CPET), depending on the chromophore identity and spin multiplicity of the excited state. The results are compared with those previously described for metal&#8208;mediated analogues featuring SnIV porphyrin chromophores and l&#8208;tyrosine as the redox active amino acid and well illustrate the peculiar role of l&#8208;tryptophan with respect to PCET.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Photoinduced electron transfer&lt;/b&gt; (ET) or concerted proton-electron transfer (CPET) occur in tin(IV) porphyrin-tryptophan conjugates in dichloromethane in the presence of an organic base depending on the chromophore identity and spin multiplicity of the excited state which point out how peculiar the &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-tryptophan amino acid is with respect to charge transfer reactions.

Ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of benzylsulfonyl macroheterocyclosiloxane and five different cyclosiloxanes was systematically investigated for the first time. A general approach for the synthesis of benzylsulfonyl&#8208;containing silicone copolymers with various substituents, including methyl, vinyl, ethyl, and phenyl, was developed herein. Notably, the obtained polymers with adjustable structures and benzylsulfonyl macroheterocyclosiloxane content possessed composition&#8208;dependent properties, including thermal, surface, and mechanical characteristics. The copolymers also emitted blue fluorescence due to the clustering&#8208;triggered emission and luminescence of nonconventional luminogens.







Abstract
Ring&#8208;opening copolymerization (ROCP) of benzylsulfonyl macroheterocyclosiloxane (BSM) and five different cyclosiloxanes was systematically investigated. A general approach for the synthesis of benzylsulfonyl&#8208;containing silicone copolymers with various substituents, including methyl, vinyl, ethyl, and phenyl, was developed herein. A series of copolymers with variable incorporation (from 6&#8201;% to 82&#8201;%) of BSM were obtained by modifying the comonomer feed ratio and using KOH as the catalyst in a mixed solvent of dimethylformamide and toluene. The obtained copolymers exhibited various composition&#8208;dependent properties and unique viscoelasticity. Notably, the surface and fluorescent characteristics as well as the glass transition temperatures of the copolymers could be tailored by varying the amount of BSM. Unlike typical sulfone&#8208;containing polymers, such as poly(olefin sulfone)s, the prepared copolymers displayed excellent thermal and hydrolytic stability. The universal strategy developed in the present study provides a platform for the design of innovative silicone copolymers with adjustable structures and performance.

Fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted carbohydrates play relevant roles in diverse areas, such as supramolecular chemistry, glycoconjugation, liquid crystals, and surfactants, with direct applications as wetting, antifreeze, and coating agents. In light of these promising applications, new methodologies for the late&#8208;stage incorporation of fluoroalkyl RF groups into carbohydrates and derivatives are here presented.

Systematic design and self&#8208;assembly of complex supramolecular coordination cages with predictable configurations has been a long&#8208;standing challenge in chemistry, which is as mysterious as the starry sky depicted in the cover image. This work reports a trackable CpZr&#8208;involved cage to cage conversion to generate a heteroleptic V2E3 cage from two homoleptic cages with different geometries of V2E3 and V4E6. Moreover, SCC&#8208;2 cage possesses a cationic cavity allowing the encapsulation of a series of sulfonate anionic guests. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Bai, Y.&#8208;F.

When fed the right food, the hermit crab depicted in the cover image grows bigger and finally needs a larger shell. This work reports the reactivity of a 1&#8208;phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornene, the product of a hetero Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between a 2H&#8208;phosphole and an activated imine. Thus, reductive cleavage of the phosphorus&#8722;nitrogen bond with LiAlH4 leads to an unprecedented ring expansion with formation of a 1&#8208;phosphabicyclo[3.2.1]octa&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene. The cover image was designed by Dr. Christoph Selg. More information can be found in the Full Paper by E. Hey&#8208;Hawkins et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100898).

         <title>Approaches to the Synthesis of Perfluoroalkyl&#8208;Modified Carbohydrates and Derivatives: Thiosugars, Iminosugars, and Tetrahydro(thio)pyrans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 29, Page 7813-7825, May 20, 2021. </description>

Perfluoroalkyl&#8208;modified carbohydrates: New protocols for the direct incorporation of fluoroalkyl groups onto carbohydrate scaffolds that rely on thermal metal&#8208;mediated chemistry and photocatalysis are presented. Along with the introduction of fluoroalkyl moieties into carbohydrates, the fluorination and fluoroalkylation reactions of iminosugars, pyrans, and thiopyrans will be presented. Recent examples on the trifluoromethylthiolation of glycals are illustrated.







Abstract
Fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted carbohydrates play relevant roles in diverse areas such as supramolecular chemistry, glycoconjugation, liquid crystals, and surfactants, with direct applications as wetting, antifreeze, and coating agents. In light of these promising applications, new methodologies for the late&#8208;stage incorporation of fluoroalkyl RF groups into carbohydrates and derivatives are herein presented as they are relevant to the synthetic carbohydrate community. Previously reviewed protocols for the installation of RF groups onto carbohydrates and derivatives will be succinctly summarized in the light of the new achievements. Fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted iminosugars, on the other hand, are also interesting glycomimetic derivatives with prominent roles as glycosidases and glycosyltransferases inhibitors, as has recently been demonstrated. Also, they positively contribute to the study of sugar&#8211;protein interactions and enzyme mechanisms. New advances in the syntheses of fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted iminosugars will also be presented here.

         <title>Interconnectivity between Surface Reactivity and Self&#8208;Assembly of Kemp Elimination Catalyzing Nanorods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 29, Page 7831-7836, May 20, 2021. </description>

Self&#8208;powered assembly: Synthetic functional assembly of catalytic unit (gold nanorod), principally regulated through their surface catalytic reactivity towards proton transfer reaction is reported. The hydrophobic cavities formed during flocking of gold nanorods has been utilized as reactors for hydrophobic substrates towards aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction in aqueous media, demonstrating a catalytic cascading which is completely unrelated to primary reaction products.







Abstract
Understanding the fundamental facts behind dynamicity of catalytic processes has been a longstanding quest across disciplines. Herein, we report self&#8208;assembly of catalytically active gold nanorods that can be regulated by tuning its reactivity towards a proton transfer reaction at different pH. Unlike substrate&#8208;induced templating and co&#8208;operativity, the enhanced aggregation rate is due to alteration of catalytic surface charge only during reactivity as negatively charged transition state of reactant (5&#8208;nitrobenzisoxazole) is formed on positively charged nanorod while undergoing a concerted E2&#8208;pathway. Herein, enhanced diffusivity during catalytic processes might also act as an additional contributing factor. Furthermore, we have also shown that nanosized hydrophobic cavities of clustered nanorods can also efficiently accelerate the rate of an aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction, which also demonstrates a catalytic phenomenon that can lead to cascading of other reactions where substrates and products of the starting reactions are not directly involved.

         <title>Tuning J&#8208;aggregate Formation and Emission Efficiency in Cationic Diazapentacenium Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 29, Page 7826-7830, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new diazapentacenium salts have been obtained from a new synthetic methodology and shown to display a drastic increase of fluorescence quantum yields induced by aggregation (AIE phenomena) in poor solvents and associated to a particular type of aggregates organization: J&#8208;aggregates. A simple structural modification (4 H in D1 vs 4 F in D2) changes the contribution of J&#8208;aggregates which is quantitatively followed by time resolved fluorescence.







Abstract
Enhancement of the luminescence efficiency of two new diazapentacenium salts (D1 and D2) of more than 55 for D1 and 22 times for D2) in poor solvents, acetonitrile and/or dichloromethane, was observed and rationalized as formation of emissive J&#8208;aggregates. Both compounds displaying 4&#8208;n&#8208;decylphenyl substituents at the 7,14&#8208;carbons and phenyl (D1) or 2,6&#8208;difluorophenyl (D2) substituents at the quaternary nitrogen atoms in 5,12&#8208;positions have been synthetized in a two&#8208;step procedure involving a two&#8208;fold Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig&#8208;type CN cross&#8208;coupling and an electrophilic Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type cyclization. The optical properties of the dicationic diazapentacenium salts in various solvents and in thin films have been investigated by steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopies. In thin films and in good solvents, isolated molecules coexist with aggregates. Nonetheless, D1 is seven times more emissive than D2, reflecting a higher J&#8208;aggregate contribution in the former.

         <title>Quadruple Photoresponsive Functionality in a Crystalline Hybrid Material: Photochromism, Photomodulated Fluorescence, Magnetism and Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 29, Page 7842-7846, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline hybrid material is reported with quadruple photoresponsive functionality, which shows photochromism, photomodulated fluorescence, magnetism, and second&#8208;order nonlinear optical properties. This work provides a general method to construct hybrid photochromic materials with multiple photoresponsive performances.







Abstract
As promising photoresponsive materials and potential smart materials, hybrid photochromic materials (HPMs), especially for crystalline HPMs (CHPMs), have been broadly explored for their potential in inheriting the merits of each constituents, and intriguing photomodulated functionality. Hitherto, the photoresponsive functionality in explored CHPMs mainly concentrate on dyad combination. By contrast, triple or quadruple photoresponsive properties are very rare because of the limited compatibility of multiple photoresponsive functionality in a single system. In this work, the electron&#8208;transfer (ET) and crystal engineering strategies were utilized to predesign CHPMs with multiple photoresponsive properties via the collaboration of paramagnetic metal ion (Dy3+), electron&#8208;donor (ED) ligand (benzene&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;tricarboxylic acid, H3BTA) and electron&#8208;acceptor (EA) ligand (1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, phen). The resulting complex [Dy(BTA)(phen)2]&#8901;2H2O (1) shows hybrid chain with the intrachain Dy3+ ions bridged and chelated by tricarboxylate and phen ligands, respectively. After photostimuli, the ET between tricarboxylate and phen results in photogenerated radicals and the resultant quadruple photoresponsive properties. Considering the abundant resources of paramagnetic metal ions, ED&#8208; and EA&#8208;ligands, this work provides a general method to construct CHPMs with multiple photoresponsive performances via the collaboration of each unit under the guidance of ET and crystal engineering strategies.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding Ion&#8208;Pair Cryptand Host Discrimination of Potassium Halide Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 29, Page 7837-7841, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen bonding (ChB) and halogen bonding (XB) ion&#8208;pair heteroditopic cryptands exhibit cooperative recognition of potassium halide salts. Incorporation of bidentate triazole&#8208;based ChB or XB donor motifs into a dibenzo&#8208;30&#8208;crown&#8208;10&#8208;based macrobicyclic receptor framework is demonstrated to profoundly influence selectivity and affinity behaviour towards the recognition of KBr and KI ion&#8208;pairs relative to hydrogen bonding analogues.







Abstract
A series of chalcogen, halogen and hydrogen bonding heteroditopic macrobicyclic cryptands are reported and their potassium halide ion&#8208;pair recognition properties investigated. Saliently, the co&#8208;bound potassium cation was determined to be crucial in switching on the bromide and iodide recognition properties of the respective cryptand receptor. Importantly, the nature of the sigma&#8208;hole mediated interaction employed in the anion recognition component is demonstrated to significantly augment the ion&#8208;pair binding behaviour, markedly so for the halogen bonding analogue. Most notably the incorporation of a chelating chalcogen bonding donor motif significantly improves the selectivity towards KBr over KI, relative to halogen and hydrogen bonding analogues.

         <dc:description>In recent years, applications of low&#8208;valent main group compounds in the field of catalysis is gaining momentum. NHC&#8208;stabilized phosphinidenes owing to the access of two lone pairs of electrons have been found as excellent Lewis bases, however, they are yet to be&#160; used as catalysts.&#160; Herein, we report an NHC stabilized phosphinidene 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(phenylphosphanylidene)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole (  1  ) for&#160; the activation of CO  2  . A closer inspection on the CO  2  activation process by DFT calculations along with intrinsic bond orbital analysis unravel that phosphinidene associates with phenylsilane through a non&#8208;covalent &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction between two phenyl rings which activates the Si&#8208;H facilitating its transfer to the CO  2  molecule. Detailed DFT studies along with spectroscopic experiments were combined to understand the mechanism of CO  2  activation and its catalytic reductive functionalization leading to the formylation of a range of chemically inert primary amides under mild reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Formulation of Next&#8208;Generation Multicompartment Microcapsules by Reversible Electrostatic Attraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Let&#8242;s assemble! Different active substances can be formulated within one carrier system. A novel melamine&#8208;formaldehyde/polyethyleneimine coating for microcapsules results in microcapsules with a positive surface charge. Based on electrostatic interactions with negative charged poly&#8208;l&#8208;lactide and poly(lactide&#8208;co&#8208;glycolide) nanocapsules, a pH&#8208;responsive hierarchical capsule@capsule system was formed. Controlled assembling (pH&#8197;7) and disassembling (pH&#8197;3) between nanocapsules and microcapsules was demonstrated.







Abstract
The combination of several active substances into one carrier is often limited due to solubility, stability and phase&#8208;separation issues. These issues have been addressed by an innovative capsule design, in which nanocapsules are assembled on the microcapsule surface by electrostatic forces to form a pH&#8208;responsive hierarchical capsule@capsule system. Here, melamine&#8208;formaldehyde (MF) microcapsules with a negative surface charge were synthesized and coated with a novel MF&#8208;polyethyleneimine (PEI) copolymer to achieve a positive charge of &#950;=+28&#8197;mV. This novel coating procedure allows the electrostatic assembly of negatively charged poly&#8208;l&#8208;lactide (PLLA, &#950;=&#8722;19&#8197;mV) and poly&#8208;(lactide&#8208;co&#8208;glycolide) (PLGA, &#950;=&#8722;56&#8197;mV) nanocapsules on the microcapsule surface. Assembly studies at pH&#8197;7 gave a partial surface coverage of PLLA nanocapsules and full surface coverage for PLGA nanocapsules. The pH&#8208;responsive adsorption and desorption of nanocapsules was shown at pH&#8197;7 and pH&#8197;3.

         <title>Copper(II) Pyridyl Aminophenolates: Hypoxia&#8208;Selective, Nucleus&#8208;Targeting Cytotoxins, and Magnetic Resonance Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine&#8208;labelled CuII complexes have been developed as hypoxia&#8208;targeting chemotherapeutics and MRI agents. Tuning the electronic properties identified a nitro&#8208;substituted complex as having hypoxia&#8208;selective cytotoxicity driven by nuclear accumulation and DNA cleavage. 19F magnetic resonance experiments discriminate between CuII and reduced complexes, thus demonstrating a bifunctional role for CuII complexes as both hypoxia probes and chemotherapeutic agents.







Abstract
Targeting the low&#8208;oxygen (hypoxic) environments found in many tumours by using redox&#8208;active metal complexes is a strategy that can enhance efficacy and reduce the side effects of chemotherapies. We have developed a series of CuII complexes with tridentate pyridine aminophenolate&#8208;based ligands for preferential activation in the reduction window provided by hypoxic tissues. Furthermore, ligand functionalization with a pendant CF3 group provides a 19F spectroscopic handle for magnetic&#8208;resonance studies of redox processes at the metal centre and behaviour in cellular environments. The phenol group in the ligand backbone was substituted at the para position with H, Cl, and NO2 to modulate the reduction potential of the CuII centre, giving a range of values below the window expected for hypoxic tissues. The NO2&#8208;substituted complex, which has the highest reduction potential, showed enhanced cytotoxic selectivity towards HeLa cells grown under hypoxic conditions. Cell death occurs by apoptosis, as determined by analysis of the cell morphology. A combination of 19F NMR and ICP&#8208;OES indicates localization of the NO2 complex in HeLa cell nuclei and increased cellular accumulation under hypoxia. This correlates with DNA nuclease activity being the likely origin of cytotoxic activity, as demonstrated by cleavage of DNA plasmids in the presence of the CuII nitro complex and a reducing agent. Selective detection of the paramagnetic CuII complexes and their diamagnetic ligands by 19F MRI suggests hypoxia&#8208;targeting theranostic applications by redox activation.

         <title>Phenyl Silicates with Substituted Catecholate Ligands: Synthesis, Structural Studies and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pathway less travelled: A general study of phenyl silicates bearing substituted catecholate ligands has been achieved. The silicates have been fully characterized and their reactivity under photooxidative conditions has been explored. Substitution of the catecholate moiety, notably with a 4&#8208;cyanocatecholato ligand, allowed the phenyl radical to be generated and trapped. Computational studies provided a rationale for these findings.







Abstract
While the generation of aryl radicals by photoredox catalysis under reductive conditions is well documented, it has remained challenging under an oxidative pathway. Because of the easy photo&#8208;oxidation of alkyl bis&#8208;catecholato silicates, a general study of phenyl silicates bearing substituted catecholate ligands has been achieved. The newly synthesized phenyl silicates have been fully characterized, and their reactivity has been explored. It was found that, thanks to the substitution of the catecholate moiety, notably with the 4&#8208;cyanocatecholato ligand, the phenyl radical could be generated and trapped. Computational studies provided a rationale for these findings.

         <title>Photoluminescent Carbon Quantum Dots: Synthetic Approaches and Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) synthesized in four different solvents or mixed solvents with 1,3,6&#8208;trinitropyrene as the carbon precursor: blue&#8208;emitting (DMF/H2O), green&#8208;emitting (EtOH/CH3CO2H), yellow&#8208;emitting (EtOH), and red&#8208;emitting (DMF). Photograph shows the photoluminescent CQDs dispersed in toluene under UV light, and normalized emission spectra with bands at 460, 517, 581, and 620&#8197;nm, respectively.







Abstract
A number of synthetic methodologies and applications of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) have been reported since they were first discovered nearly two decades ago. Unlike metal&#8208;based or semiconductor&#8208;based (e.&#8201;g., metal chalcogenides) quantum dots (MSQDs), CQDs have the unique feature of being prepared through a variety of synthetic protocols, which are typically understood from considerations of reaction models and photoluminescence mechanisms. Consequently, this brief review article describes quantum dots, in general, and CQDs, in particular, from various viewpoints: (i) their definition, (ii) their photophysical properties, and (iii) the superiority of CQDs over MSQDs. Where possible, comparisons are made between CQDs and MSQDs. First, however, the review begins with a general brief description of quantum dots (QDs) as nanomaterials (sizes&#8804;10&#8197;nm), followed by a short description of MSQDs and CQDs. Described subsequently are the various top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up approaches to synthesize CQDs followed by their distinctive photophysical properties (emission spectra; quantum yields, &#934;s).

         <title>Hollow POM@MOF&#8208;derived Porous NiMo6@Co3O4 for Biothiol Colorimetric Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiMo6@ZIF&#8208;67 derived hollow porous Co3O4 with tetrahedral sites (with four oxygen neighbours) and octahedral sites (with six oxygen neighbours) were prepared. Compared with pure porous and commercial Co3O4, NiMo6@Co3O4(n) exhibit the enhanced peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activity and stability, and the corresponding &#8216;on&#8208;off switch&#8217; colorimetric biosensing platform with the inspiring sensitivity and terrific selectivity for L&#8208;cysteine (L&#8208;Cys) detection has been developed to date.







Abstract
Developing highly active and sensitive peroxidase mimics for L&#8208;cysteine (L&#8208;Cys) colorimetric detection is very important for biotechnology and medical diagnosis. Herein, polyoxometalate&#8208;doped porous Co3O4 composite (NiMo6@Co3O4) was designed and prepared for the first time. Compared with pure and commercial Co3O4, NiMo6@Co3O4(n) composites exhibit the enhanced peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activities and stabilities due to the strong synergistic effect between porous Co3O4 and multi&#8208;electron NiMo6 clusters. Moreover, the peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activities of NiMo6@Co3O4(n) composites are heavily dependent on the doping mass of NiMo6, and the optimized NiMo6@Co3O4(2) exhibits the superlative peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activity. More importantly, a sensitive L&#8208;Cys colorimetric detection is developed with the sensitivity of 0.023&#8197;&#956;M&#8722;1 and the detection limit at least 0.018&#8197;&#956;M in the linear range of 1&#8211;20&#8197;&#956;M, which is by far the best enzyme&#8208;mimetic performances, to the best our knowledge.

         <title>From BN&#8208;Naphthalenes to Benzoborole Dianions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzoborole dianions have been selectively prepared in one step by lithium reduction of easily available BN&#8208;naphthalene derivatives. With this ring&#8208;contraction strategy, several new types of amino and phenyl&#8208;substituted benzoborole dianions could be obtained in excellent yields. Treatment of these dianions with methyl iodide resulted in the formation of the corresponding borates, which were luminescent both in solution and in the solid state.







Abstract
The synthesis of benzoborole dianions by alkali metal reduction of BN&#8208;naphthalene derivatives via a ring&#8208;contraction strategy has been developed. Reduction of 1&#8208;alkynyl 2,1&#8208;benzazaborine 1&#8201;a in Et2O led to the elimination of alkynyllithium with the formation of 1&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;benzoborole trilithium salt 2&#8201;a, whereas reduction of 1&#8208;phenyl 2,1&#8208;benzazaborine 1&#8201;c in THF yielded 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;benzoborole dilithium salt 2&#8201;c with the elimination of ArNHLi. The trilithium and dilithium salts 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;c have been fully characterized. Treatment of trilithium salt 2&#8201;a with Et3NHCl led to the selective protonation of the amino lithium to afford the dilithium salt 2&#8201;aH, which could be cleanly oxidized to 1&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;benzoborole 3 in an excellent yield. Reaction of 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;benzoborole dilithium salt 2&#8201;c with MeI yielded the lithium borate 4&#8201;c, which is luminescent both in solution and in the solid state.

         <title>Unraveling the Guest&#8208;Induced Switchability in the Metal&#8208;Organic Framework DUT&#8208;13(Zn)**

Breathe! Combining synchrotron in&#8197;situ PXRD with gas adsorption has shed light on the mechanism of guest&#8208;induced breathing in dynamic DUT&#8208;13 framework. In the contracted&#8208;pore phase, the crystal has pores half the volume of those in the open&#8208;pore phase; this is consistent with the adsorption isotherms. Methane physisorption isotherms at different temperatures indicate the softness of the framework.







Abstract
The switching mechanism of the flexible framework Zn4O(benztb)1.5 (benztb=N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;benzidine tetrabenzoate), also known as DUT&#8208;13, was studied by advanced powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and gas physisorption techniques. In&#8197;situ synchrotron PXRD experiments upon physisorption of nitrogen (77&#8197;K) and n&#8208;butane (273&#8197;K) shed light on the hitherto unnoticed guest&#8208;induced breathing in the MOF. The mechanism of contraction is based on the conformationally labile benztb ligand and accompanied by a reduction in specific pore volume from 2.03&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 in the open&#8208;pore phase to 0.91&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 in the contracted&#8208;pore phase. The high temperature limit for adsorption&#8208;induced contraction of 170&#8197;K, determined by systematic temperature variation of methane adsorption isotherms, indicates that the DUT&#8208;13 framework is softer than other mesoporous MOFs like DUT&#8208;49 and does not support the formation of overloaded metastable states required for negative gas&#8208;adsorption transitions.

         <title>Rapidly Adaptive All&#8208;covalent Nanoparticle Surface Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acetal&#8208;terminated surface ligands stabilize idealized colloidal nanoparticle building blocks. On&#8208;demand activation of the masked aldehyde functionality occurs rapidly under mild conditions with precise stoichiometric control, revealing a versatile platform for all&#8208;covalent post&#8208;synthesis surface engineering. On&#8208;surface dynamic covalent transformations lead to diverse structural and functional modifications including rapidly adaptive environment&#8208;responsive nanomaterials.







Abstract
Emerging nanotechnologies demand the manipulation of nanoscale components with the same predictability and programmability as is taken for granted in molecular synthetic methodologies. Yet installing appropriately reactive chemical functionality on nanomaterial surfaces has previously entailed compromises in terms of reactivity scope, functionalization density, or both. Here, we introduce an idealized dynamic covalent nanoparticle building block for divergent and adaptive post&#8208;synthesis modification of colloidal nanomaterials. Acetal&#8208;protected monolayer&#8208;stabilized gold nanoparticles are prepared via operationally simple protocols and are stable to long&#8208;term storage. Tunable surface densities of reactive aldehyde functionalities are revealed on&#8208;demand, leading to a wide range of adaptive surface engineering options from one nanoscale synthon. Analytically tractable with molecular precision, interfacial reaction kinetics and dynamic surface constitutions can be probed in&#8197;situ at the ensemble level. High functionalization densities combined with rapid equilibration kinetics enable environmentally adaptive surface constitutions and rapid nanoparticle property switching in response to simple chemical effectors.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of Highly Fluorescent and CPL&#8208;Active Dispiroindeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorenes</title>

Spiraling under control: Configurationally stable [7]&#8208;helical dispirodihydro[2,1&#8208;c]indenofluorenes (DSF&#8208;IFs) have been synthesized with er values up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 by using intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of tethered triynediols catalyzed by RhI/SEGPHOS&#174;. The chiral DSF&#8208;IFs had circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity and exceptionally high fluorescence.







Abstract
The enantioselective synthesis of chiral [7]&#8208;helical dispirodihydro[2,1&#8208;c]indenofluorenes (DSF&#8208;IFs) was achieved for the first time in good yields with high er values (er up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1). The crucial step of the whole reaction sequence was the enantioselective intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of tethered triynediols to indenofluorenediols, which was catalyzed by a Rh/SEGPHOS&#174; complex. Further transformations led to the corresponding DSF&#8208;IFs. The prepared helically chiral DSF&#8208;IFs combine circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity (glum=&#8764;10&#8722;3) with exceptionally high fluorescence quantum yields (up to &#934;lum=0.97).

         <title>Carbo&#8208;mer of Barrelene: A Rigid 3D&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Expanded Molecular Barrel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
After 1D (Z)&#8208;dimethylidynebutene, 2D benzene and 2D xylylene, carbo&#8208;meric expansion of 3D barrelene is envisaged. First examples of carbo&#8208;barrelenes have thus been obtained in 2&#8211;3 steps from classical substrates used for the synthesis of carbo&#8208;benzenes and carbo&#8208;xylylenes. Beyond experimental characterization by NMR/UV/Vis spectroscopy, voltammetry and crystallography, DFT&#8208;based theoretical analyses of carbo&#8208;barrelenes allow interpretation of their observed structural and electronic features and anticipation of their possible host capability toward ionic guests such as NH4+ or metallic ions.







Abstract
After extensive studies of 1D and 2D skeletal carbo&#8208;mers based on C8 &#960;&#8208;conjugating dialkynylbutatriene units (DABs: &#8764;C&#8801;C&#8722;(R)C=C=C=C(R)&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8764;) bridging sp or sp2 centers in carbo&#8208;butene, carbo&#8208;xylylene or carbo&#8208;benzene derivatives, 3D versions are envisaged through carbo&#8208;barrelenes and partially reduced derivatives thereof where two or three DAB blades span a bridge between sp3 carbinol vertices or ether thereof. For R=Ph, stable representatives were synthesized through a pivotal [6]pericyclynedione, and extensively characterized by spectroscopic, electrochemical and crystallographic methods. Density functional theory calculations allow detailed analysis of structural and electronic features of the 7&#8197;&#197; high C26 barrel&#8208;shaped molecules, and show that they can behave as cages for ionic species. Beyond aesthetical concerns, the results could open prospects of applications in host&#8208;guest supramolecular chemistry and single molecule charge transport.

         <title>Acetylenic Replacement of Albicidin's Methacrylamide Residue Circumvents Detrimental E/Z Photoisomerization and Preserves Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead optimization: The cinnamoyl residue of the antibiotic albicidin is shown to readily undergo UV&#8208;mediated E/Z isomerization, thereby converting from the highly bioactive E form found in the natural product to the significantly less bioactive Z form. Acetylenic replacement of the susceptible methylacrylamide moiety affords a set of photochemically stable albicidin derivatives with virtually undiminished antibacterial activity.







Abstract
The natural product albicidin is a highly potent inhibitor of bacterial DNA gyrase. Its outstanding activity, particularly against Gram&#8208;negative pathogens, qualifies it as a promising lead structure in the search for new antibacterial drugs. However, as we show here, the N&#8208;terminal cinnamoyl moiety of albicidin is susceptible to photochemical E/Z isomerization. Moreover, the newly formed Z isomer exhibits significantly reduced antibacterial activity, which hampers the development and biological evaluation of albicidin and potent derivatives thereof. Hence, we synthesized 13 different variants of albicidin in which the vulnerable para&#8208;coumaric acid moiety was replaced; this yielded photostable analogues. Biological activity assays revealed that diaryl alkyne analogues exhibited virtually undiminished antibacterial efficacy. This promising scaffold will therefore serve as a blueprint for the design of a potent albicidin&#8208;based drug.

         <title>Nematic Triphenyltriazine Triesters and the Induction of the Columnar Mesophase by Fluorine Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine induces columnar instead of nematic self&#8208;assembly in easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize triphenyltriazine triesters, which have high triplet energies and no own fluorescence. Such matrices could lead to enhanced light outcoupling from blue delayed&#8208;fluorescent devices by emitter alignment.







Abstract
Whereas their para homologs are not mesogenic, the disk&#8208;shaped triphenyltriazine meta&#8208;trialkylesters obtained via trimerization of 3&#8208;cyanobenzoic alkylester, which are configurationally more flexible, exhibit a monotropic nematic mesophase. Introduction of fluorine atoms into the alkyl chains or into the phenyl moieties leads to the appearance of an enantiotropic columnar mesophase. If fluorine is introduced both in the chains and in the phenyl moieties, only a monotropic mesophase remains. Fluorination of either the alkyl chains or the aromatic core, but not both, appears thus as a simple means of inducing or stabilizing columnar self&#8208;assembly in disk&#8208;shaped systems. As the homeotropically alignable columnar mesophase can thus be made to persist at room temperature, as energies higher than 3&#8197;eV of the first excited triplet state are computed in agreement with the value reported for the parent arene, and as they are not fluorescent themselves, these compounds are of promise as aligning host matrices for blue&#8208;emitting TADF devices with improved light outcoupling. Dilution of a columnar with a nonmesogenic homolog induces the nematic state, indicating that the nanoscopic make&#8208;up of both mesophases is closely related.

Fluorination of either the alkyl chains or the aromatic core, but not both, appears thus as a simple means of inducing or stabilizing columnar self-assembly in disk-shaped systems. As the homeotropically alignable columnar mesophase can thus be made to persist at room temperature, as energies higher than 3&#8197;eV of the first excited triplet state are computed in agreement with the value reported for the parent arene, and as they are not fluorescent themselves, these compounds are of promise as aligning host matrices for blue-emitting TADF devices with improved light outcoupling. Dilution of a columnar with a nonmesogenic homolog induces the nematic state, indicating that the nanoscopic make-up of both mesophases is closely related.&lt;/p&gt;

Investigation of the coordination behavior of salicylidene glucosamine (H2L1) towards uranyl ions (UO22+) revealed the exclusive formation of a trinuclear anionic uranyl complex [(UO2)3(&#956;3&#8208;O)(L1)3]2&#8722; (12&#8722;), which was isolated by precipitation with the alkali metals ions Cs+, Rb+, and K+. Recrystallization of the Cs salt in the presence of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 in DMF led to the formation of the solvated ion pair [Cs(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)]21, in which coordination of the Cs+ ion by three uranyl oxygen atoms was observe.







Abstract
The reaction of UO2(OAc)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O with the biologically inspired ligand 2&#8208;salicylidene glucosamine (H2L1) results in the formation of the anionic trinuclear uranyl complex [(UO2)3(&#956;3&#8208;O)(L1)3]2&#8722; (12&#8722;), which was isolated in good yield as its Cs&#8208;salt, [Cs]21. Recrystallization of [Cs]21 in the presence of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 led to formation of a neutral ion pair of type [M(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)]21, which was also obtained for the alkali metal ions Rb+ and K+ (M=Cs, Rb, K). The related ligand, 2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;naphthylidene) glucosamine (H2L2) in a similar procedure with Cs+ gave the corresponding complex [Cs(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)]2[(UO2)3(&#956;3&#8208;O)(L2)3 ([Cs(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)]22). From X&#8208;ray investigations, the [(UO2)3O(Ln)3]2&#8722; anion (n=1, 2) in each complex is a discrete trinuclear uranyl species that coordinates to the alkali metal ion via three uranyl oxygen atoms. The coordination behavior of H2L1 and H2L2 towards UO22+ was investigated by NMR, UV/Vis spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, revealing the in&#8197;situ formation of the 12&#8722; and 22&#8722;dianions in solution.

         <title>Na2FePO4F/Biocarbon Nanocomposite Hollow Microspheres Derived from Biological Cell Template as High&#8208;Performance Cathode Material for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Na2FePO4F/biocarbon nanocomposite hollow microspheres were synthesized through self&#8208;assembly of yeast cell biotemplates. The electrode delivered high initial capacity (114.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C), long&#8208;cycle stability (74.3&#8201;% retention after 500 cycles at 5&#8197;C), and high rate capability (70.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;C).







Abstract
We have successfully synthesized Na2FePO4F/biocarbon nanocomposite hollow microspheres from FeIII precursor as cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries through self&#8208;assembly of yeast cell biotemplate and sol&#8208;gel technology. The carbon coating on the nanoparticle surface with a mesoporous structure enhances electron diffusion into Na2FePO4F crystal particles. The improved electrochemical performance of Na2FePO4F/biocarbon nanocomposites is attributed to the larger electrode&#8722;electrolyte contact area and more active sites for Na+ on the surface of hollow microspheres compared with those of Na2FePO4F/C. The Na2FePO4F/biocarbon nanocomposite exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 114.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C, long&#8208;cycle stability with a capacity retention of 74.3&#8201;% after 500 cycles at 5&#8197;C, and excellent rate capability (70.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;C) compared with Na2FePO4F/C. This novel nanocomposite hollow microsphere structure is suitable for improving the property of other cathode materials for high&#8208;power batteries.

&#963;&#8208;Silane adducts and alcohol adducts are kinetically detected intermediates in zinc&#8208;catalyzed &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis&#8208;type dehydrocoupling reactions. These intermediates feature prominently in the reactivity of coordinatively unsaturated zinc centers, which efficiently mediate Si&#8722;O bond formation. The catalyst is responsive to reaction conditions, adapting as a function of concentration to follow the kinetically preferred mechanism.

ZnR (PhBOX
=phenyl&#8208;(4,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;oxazolinato; R=Me: 2&#8201;a, Et: 2&#8201;b) catalyzes the dehydrocoupling of primary or secondary silanes and alcohols to give silyl ethers and hydrogen, with high turnover numbers (TON; up to 107) under solvent&#8208;free conditions. Primary and secondary silanes react with small, medium, and large alcohols to give various degrees of substitution, from mono&#8208; to tri&#8208;alkoxylation, whereas tri&#8208;substituted silanes do not react with MeOH under these conditions. The effect of coordinative unsaturation on the behavior of the Zn catalyst is revealed through a dramatic variation of both rate law and experimental rate constants, which depend on the concentrations of both the alcohol and hydrosilane reactants. That is, the catalyst adapts its mechanism to access the most facile and efficient conversion. In particular, either alcohol or hydrosilane binds to the open coordination site on the PhBOX
ZnOR catalyst to form a PhBOX
ZnOR(HOR) complex under one set of conditions or an unprecedented &#963;&#8208;adduct PhBOX
ZnOR(H&#8722;SiR&#8242;3) under other conditions. Saturation kinetics provide evidence for the latter species, in support of the hypothesis that &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis reactions involving four&#8208;centered electrocyclic 2&#963;&#8211;2&#963; transition states are preceded by &#963;&#8208;adducts.

         <title>Bis(pertrifluoromethylcatecholato)silane: Extreme Lewis Acidity Broadens the Catalytic Portfolio of Silicon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The extremely electron&#8208;deficient tetratrifluorocatechol is synthesized and installed at silicon, providing a Lewis superacid that ranks among the strongest fluoride ion acceptors accessible in the condensed phase. The compound enables silicon&#8208;catalyzed deoxygenation of ketones, aldehydes, amides and phosphine oxides and the first silicon catalyzed carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis.







Abstract
Given its earth abundance, silicon is ideal for constructing Lewis acids of use in catalysis or materials science. Neutral silanes were limited to moderate Lewis acidity, until halogenated catecholato ligands provoked a significant boost. However, catalytic applications of bis(perhalocatecholato)silanes were suffering from very poor solubility and unknown deactivation pathways. In this work, the novel per(trifluoromethyl)catechol, H2catCF3, and adducts of its silicon complex Si(catCF3)2 (1) are described. According to the computed fluoride ion affinity, 1 ranks among the strongest neutral Lewis acids currently accessible in the condensed phase. The improved robustness and affinity of 1 enable deoxygenations of aldehydes, ketones, amides, or phosphine oxides, and a carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis. All those transformations have never been catalyzed by a neutral silane. Attempts to obtain donor&#8208;free 1 attest to the extreme Lewis acidity by stabilizing adducts with even the weakest donors, such as benzophenone or hexaethyl disiloxane.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Low Pressure Carbonylation of Allylic Alcohols by Catalytic Anhydride Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct carbonylation of allylic alcohols is described for the first time with high catalyst activity at low pressure (10&#8197;bar). Key to high activities in the carbonylation is the finding that catalytic amounts of anhydride activate the substrate.







Abstract
A direct carbonylation of allylic alcohols has been realized for the first time with high catalyst activity at low pressure of CO (10&#8197;bar). The procedure is described in detail for the carbonylation of E&#8208;nerolidol, an important step in a new BASF&#8208;route to (&#8722;)&#8208;ambrox. Key to high activities in the allylic alcohol carbonylation is the finding that catalytic amounts of carboxylic anhydride activate the substrate and are constantly regenerated with carbon monoxide under the reaction conditions. The identified reaction conditions are transferrable to other substrates as well.

         <title>Nucleophilic Reactions of Osmanaphthalynes with PMe3 and H2O</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New classes of osmium complexes bearing different substituents have been synthesized in a one&#8208;pot method comprising ligand substitution and nucleophilic addition of osmanaphthalynes. Aided by DFT calculations, the possible mechanism of this experiment is discussed. Moreover, all the target complexes have been fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy, HRMS and elemental analysis.







Abstract
Members of a new class of complexes, 2(CF3), 2(H), 2(Br), 2(I), and 2(OCH3), have been synthesized in a one&#8208;pot method involving the treatment of osmanaphthalynes bearing corresponding substituents (1(CF3), 1(H), 1(Br), 1(I), and 1(OCH3)) with trimethylphosphine (PMe3) and water. The main reaction process involves two steps, namely a ligand&#8208;exchange with trimethylphosphine and nucleophilic addition of water to the Os&#8801;C bond of the osmanaphthalyne. The substituents have a significant influence on the rate of the reaction, as befits a nucleophilic addition. Fortunately, the key intermediate [1(OCH3)]&#8242; could be successfully captured, and the detailed reaction mechanism has been explored with the aid of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which were in excellent agreement with the experimental findings. All of the target complexes have been fully characterized by 1H, 31P{1H}, and 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopy, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis.

         <title>Analysis of Non&#8208;innocence of Phosphaquinodimethane Ligands when Charge and Aromaticity Come into Play</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In order to analyze their non&#8208;innocence character when ligated in M(CO)5 complexes, various phosphaquinodimethanes (pPQDM) and their complexes have been theoretically investigated regarding their electronic and structural properties, following corresponding changes in substitution, charge and spin state. Additionally, a combination of computed spin distributions and NICS values with geometric distortion models (HOMA, HOMQc) were used to gain further insights.







Abstract
Several phosphaquinodimethanes and their M(CO)5 complexes (M=Cr, Mo, W) and model derivatives have been theoretically investigated regarding the quest of non&#8208;innocence. Computed structural and electronic properties of the P&#8208;Me/NH2 substituted phosphaquinodimethanes and tungsten complexes revealed an interesting non&#8208;innocent ligand behaviour for the radical anion complexes with distonic ion character and a strong rearomatization of the middle phenyl ring. The latter was further probed taking also geometric aromaticity (HOMA) and quinoid distortion parameters (HOMQc) into account, as well as NICS(1). Furthermore, the effect of the P&#8208;substitution was investigated for real (or plausible) complexes and their free ligands focusing on the resulting aromaticity at the middle phenyl ring and vertical one&#8208;electron redox processes. The best picture of ligand engagement in redox changes was provided by representing NICS(1) values versus HOMA and the new geometric distortion parameter HOMQc8.

         <title>Developing Bright Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)&#8208;like Fluorogens for Live&#8208;Cell Imaging with Nonpolar Protein&#8722;Chromophore Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redder fluorogen derived from jellyfish: Using a double&#8208;donor&#8208;one&#8208;acceptor strategy, we designed and synthesized a new yellow fluorogen from GFP chromophore (jellyfish Aequorea victoria) that shows the highest brightness upon binding a popular FAST protein tag, enabling live&#8208;cell imaging with specific staining. By effectively partitioning the environmental parameters via multivariable analysis of ultrafast spectroscopic data, the H&#8208;bonding and dipolar interactions are revealed to govern fluorogenicity.







Abstract
Fluorescence&#8208;activating proteins (FAPs) that bind a chromophore and activate its fluorescence have gained popularity in bioimaging. The fluorescence&#8208;activating and absorption&#8208;shifting tag (FAST) is a light&#8208;weight FAP that enables fast reversible fluorogen binding, thus advancing multiplex and super&#8208;resolution imaging. However, the rational design of FAST&#8208;specific fluorogens with large fluorescence enhancement (FE) remains challenging. Herein, a new fluorogen directly engineered from green fluorescent protein (GFP) chromophore by a unique double&#8208;donor&#8208;one&#8208;acceptor strategy, which exhibits an over 550&#8208;fold FE upon FAST binding and a high extinction coefficient of approximately 100,000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, is reported. Correlation analysis of the excited state nonradiative decay rates and environmental factors reveal that the large FE is caused by nonpolar protein&#8722;fluorogen interactions. Our deep insights into structure&#8208;function relationships could guide the rational design of bright fluorogens for live&#8208;cell imaging with extended spectral properties such as redder emissions.

Stable complex with {Cl2}. Oxochloroselenate with incorporated Cl2 units, TMA3{[Se2O2Cl7](Cl2)}, features very strong halogen bonding in solid state and high thermal stability. The nature of non&#8208;covalent interactions was investigated by theoretical and spectral methods.







Abstract
Reaction of SeO2, tetramethylammonium (TMA) chloride, aqueous HCl and Cl2 yields oxochloroselenate with incorporated Cl2 units, TMA3{[Se2O2Cl7](Cl2)}. The main feature of this compound is the strong (up to 3.5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, according to DFT calculations) Cl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl bonding, which is also detected by Raman spectroscopy.

         <title>Synthetic Approaches for 15N&#8208;Labeled Hyperpolarized Heterocyclic Molecular Imaging Agents for 15N NMR Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange in Microtesla Magnetic Fields</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Getting hyper: This minireview provides a selective overview of 15N&#8208;labeling approaches for the preparation of contrast agents hyperpolarized by using the SABRE&#8208;SHEATH technique. This technique employs parahydrogen as a fast and inexpensive means to produce hyperpolarized biocompatible contrast agents for molecular imaging applications.







Abstract
NMR hyperpolarization techniques enhance nuclear spin polarization by several orders of magnitude resulting in corresponding sensitivity gains. This enormous sensitivity gain enables new applications ranging from studies of small molecules by using high&#8208;resolution NMR spectroscopy to real&#8208;time metabolic imaging in&#8197;vivo. Several hyperpolarization techniques exist for hyperpolarization of a large repertoire of nuclear spins, although the 13C and 15N sites of biocompatible agents are the key targets due to their widespread use in biochemical pathways. Moreover, their long T1 allows hyperpolarized states to be retained for up to tens of minutes. Signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE) is a low&#8208;cost and ultrafast hyperpolarization technique that has been shown to be versatile for the hyperpolarization of 15N nuclei. Although large sensitivity gains are enabled by hyperpolarization, 15N natural abundance is only &#8764;0.4&#8201;%, so isotopic labeling of the molecules to be hyperpolarized is required in order to take full advantage of the hyperpolarized state. Herein, we describe selected advances in the preparation of 15N&#8208;labeled compounds with the primary emphasis on using these compounds for SABRE polarization in microtesla magnetic fields through spontaneous polarization transfer from parahydrogen. Also, these principles can certainly be applied for hyperpolarization of these emerging contrast agents using dynamic nuclear polarization and other techniques.

         <title>Coordination Properties of Hydroxyisophthalic Acids: Topological Correlations, Synthesis, Structural Analysis, and Properties of New Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological regularities in coordination networks allowed the design of new compounds of K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+, NH4+ with 4,5,6&#8208;trihydroxyisophthalate dianion. The structures exhibit cluster structural groups, coordination of water, and the ligand through asymmetric coordination modes, aromatic stacking, and H&#8208;bonds competing with coordination bonds. The structural features favor second harmonic generation and possible proton transport.







Abstract
Hydroxyisophthalic acids are valuable polytopic ligands for the design of functional materials based on coordination polymers due to the variety of charges and coordination modes they possess. Herein, we describe the synthesis, thermal stability, nonlinear optical (NLO) and spectroscopic properties of five novel coordination compounds, [K2L(H2O)2], [MgL(H2O)2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O, [CaL(H2O)3], [SrL(H2O)3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O, [BaL(H2O)(H2O)5], and one salt, (NH4)2L&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O, with 4,5,6&#8208;trihydroxyisophthalic acid (H2L), which has not been tested in assembling crystalline coordination networks before. The peculiarities of the structural organization of the compounds were analyzed and compared with those for other hydroxyisophthalates. The coordination properties of hydroxyisophthalic acids were studied from the topological point of view, and a comparative topological analysis of coordination and H&#8208;bonded networks was performed. Structural correlations revealed in this study could be useful for the design of hydroxyisophthalate&#8208;based coordination networks, including porous metal&#8208;organic frameworks, proton conductors, and NLO materials.

         <title>Dual Control of Peptide Conformation with Light and Metal Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coiled coil peptide programmed with 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline (HQ) and imidazole groups exhibits a conformational shift to a &#946;&#8208;sheet structure upon coordination of Zn2+, whereas the introduction of other metal ions (Cu2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Mg2+, and Ni2+) does not lead to a conformational change.







Abstract
The design of a stimuli&#8208;responsive peptide whose conformation is controlled by wavelength&#8208;specific light and metal coordination is described. The peptide adopts a defined tertiary structure and its conformation can be modulated between an &#945;&#8208;helical coiled coil and &#946;&#8208;sheet. The peptide is designed with a hydrophobic interface to induce coiled coil formation and is based on a recently described strategy to obtain switchable helix dimers. Herein, we endowed the helix dimer with 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline (HQ) groups to achieve metal coordination and shift to a &#946;&#8208;sheet structure. It was found that the conformational shift only occurs upon introduction of Zn2+; other metal ions (Cu2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Mg2, and Ni2+) do not offer switching likely due to non&#8208;specific metal&#8208;peptide coordination. A control peptide lacking the metal&#8208;coordinating residues does not show conformational switching with Zn2+ supporting the role of this metal in stabilizing the &#946;&#8208;sheet conformation in a defined manner.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Triggered Structural Dynamics of Non&#8208;Coordinating Guest Moieties in a Fluorescent Actinide Polyrotaxane Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new fluorescent uranyl&#8208;coordination polyrotaxane only connected by macrocyclic host has been constructed. The non&#8208;coordinating guest (C7BPy) in the obtained polyrotaxane shows thermal displacement and dynamic conformational variations with temperature increasing from 150 to 300&#8197;K. Meanwhile, this polyrotaxene can selectively detect Fe3+ over other eight competing cations in aqueous solution, with the limit of Fe3+ detection as low as 4.4&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;ppm.







Abstract
We present here the synthesis of a novel fluorescent actinide polyrotaxane compound URCP1 through the utilization of an end&#8208;cutting pseudorotaxane precursor with only the cucurbit[6]uril (CB[6]) macrocyclic components acting as linking struts. The non&#8208;coordinating guest motif in the obtained polyrotaxane, with increased freedom and structural flexibility, can display intriguing temperature&#8208;triggered conformational variations inside the cavity of CB[6], which was clearly evidenced by crystallographic snapshots at different temperatures. Notably, this observation of temperature&#8208;triggered structural dynamics in URCP1 represents the first report of actinide polyrotaxane with such feature in solid&#8208;state. Moreover, URCP1 has a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 49.8&#8201;%, comparable to other luminescent uranyl compounds, and can work as a fluorescent probe to selectively detect Fe3+ over other eight competing cations in aqueous solution, with the limit of detection being as low as 4.4&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;ppm.

The non-coordinating guest (&lt;b&gt;C7BPy&lt;/b&gt;) in the obtained polyrotaxane shows thermal displacement and dynamic conformational variations with temperature increasing from 150 to 300&#8197;K. Meanwhile, this polyrotaxene can selectively detect Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; over other eight competing cations in aqueous solution, with the limit of Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; detection as low as 4.4&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;ppm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present here the synthesis of a novel fluorescent actinide polyrotaxane compound &lt;b&gt;URCP1&lt;/b&gt; through the utilization of an end-cutting pseudorotaxane precursor with only the cucurbit[6]uril (CB[6]) macrocyclic components acting as linking struts. The non-coordinating guest motif in the obtained polyrotaxane, with increased freedom and structural flexibility, can display intriguing temperature-triggered conformational variations inside the cavity of CB[6], which was clearly evidenced by crystallographic snapshots at different temperatures. Notably, this observation of temperature-triggered structural dynamics in &lt;b&gt;URCP1&lt;/b&gt; represents the first report of actinide polyrotaxane with such feature in solid-state. Moreover, &lt;b&gt;URCP1&lt;/b&gt; has a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 49.8&#8201;%, comparable to other luminescent uranyl compounds, and can work as a fluorescent probe to selectively detect Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; over other eight competing cations in aqueous solution, with the limit of detection being as low as 4.4&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;ppm.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Stiffening and Non&#8208;Cell Adhesive Properties of Amphiphilic Peptides with Central Alkylene Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive study on the amphiphilic peptides revealed unexpected effects of inserting an alkylene chain at the center on strengthening &#946;&#8208;sheet hydrogen bonds, providing stiffened hydrogels and diminishing cell adhesion property, which are clearly different from the effects of putting an alkyl tail at an end. This finding offers a novel molecular design to tune mechanical and biological functionalities of peptide materials.







Abstract
Amphiphilic peptides bearing terminal alkyl tails form supramolecular nanofibers that are increasingly used as biomaterials with multiple functionalities. Insertion of alkylene chains in peptides can be designed as another type of amphiphilic peptide, yet the influence of the internal alkylene chains on self&#8208;assembly and biological properties remains poorly defined. Unlike the terminal alkyl tails, the internal alkylene chains can affect not only the hydrophobicity but also the flexibility and packing of the peptides. Herein, we demonstrate the supramolecular and biological effects of the central alkylene chain length inserted in a peptide. Insertion of the alkylene chain at the center of the peptide allowed for strengthened &#946;&#8208;sheet hydrogen bonds and modulation of the packing order, and consequently the amphiphilic peptide bearing C2 alkylene chain formed a hydrogel with the highest stiffness. Interestingly, the amphiphilic peptides bearing internal alkylene chains longer than C2 showed a diminished cell&#8208;adhesive property. This study offers a novel molecular design to tune mechanical and biological properties of peptide materials.

         <dc:description>
The diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of a configurationally stable S&#8208;shaped double azahelicene&#8208;like molecule showing good chiroptical responses has been achieved with the high ee value of 89&#8201;% by the rhodium(I)/xyl&#8208;segphos&#8208;complex&#8208;catalyzed double [2+2+2] cycloaddition of a dicyanotetrayne.







Abstract
The enantioselective synthesis of aza[6] and [7]helicene&#8208;like molecules have been achieved by the cationic rhodium(I)/axially chiral biaryl bisphosphine complex&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of cyanodiynes. This protocol was successfully applied to the diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of an S&#8208;shaped double aza[6]helicene&#8208;like molecule with a high ee value of 89&#8201;%. Although no epimerization and racemization were observed in the double carbo[6]helicene&#8208;like molecule at 80&#8201;&#176;C, epimerization and racemization of the double aza[6]helicene&#8208;like molecule proceeded at 80&#8201;&#176;C. This double aza[6]helicene&#8208;like molecule showed good fluorescent quantum yields and chiroptical responses under both neutral and acidic conditions.

         <title>Relay&#8208;Heck Cross&#8208;Coupling Between Alkenyl Halides and Unsaturated Alcohols in the Synthesis of Open&#8208;Chain Analogues of Musk Odorant Vulcanolide</title>

         <dc:description>
Unactivated alkenyl iodides and bromides underwent an unprecedented palladium&#8208;catalyzed relay&#8208;Heck cross&#8208;coupling with a wide range of alkenols. This methodology allowed for the preparation of open&#8208;chain analogues of the musk odorant Vulcanolide.







Abstract
Unactivated alkenyl iodides and bromides underwent an unprecedented palladium&#8208;catalyzed relay&#8208;Heck cross&#8208;coupling with a whole range of alkenols of different chain lengths linking the alkene and the alcohol, affording unsaturated aldehydes and ketones in moderate to good yields. In contrast, alkenyl triflates were not suitable partners for this reaction. This method allowed the preparation of open&#8208;chain analogues of the musk odorant Vulcanolide, several of which retained key olfactory properties of the parent molecule.

Carba&#8208;trisaccharide cyclophellitols are potent GH76 &#945;&#8208;1,6 endo&#8208;mannanase inactivators and resistant to endoglycosidic bond cleavage.







Abstract
There is a vast genomic resource for enzymes active on carbohydrates. Lagging far behind, however, are functional chemical tools for the rapid characterization of carbohydrate&#8208;active enzymes. Activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs) offer one chemical solution to these issues with ABPs based upon cyclophellitol epoxide and aziridine covalent and irreversible inhibitors representing a potent and widespread approach. Such inhibitors for enzymes active on polysaccharides are potentially limited by the requirement for several glycosidic bonds, themselves substrates for the enzyme targets. Here, it is shown that non&#8208;hydrolysable trisaccharide can be synthesized and applied even to enzymes with challenging subsite requirements. It was found that incorporation of carbasugar moieties, which was accomplished by cuprate&#8208;assisted regioselective trans&#8208;diaxial epoxide opening of carba&#8208;mannal synthesised for this purpose, yields inactivators that act as powerful activity&#8208;based inhibitors for &#945;&#8208;1,6 endo&#8208;mannanases. 3&#8208;D structures at 1.35&#8211;1.47&#8197;&#197; resolutions confirm the design rationale and binding to the enzymatic nucleophile. Carbasugar oligosaccharide cyclophellitols offer a powerful new approach for the design of robust endoglycosidase inhibitors, while the synthesis procedures presented here should allow adaptation towards activity&#8208;based endoglycosidase probes as well as configurational isosteres targeting other endoglycosidase families.

         <title>Selectivity in the Ligand Functionalization of Photocatalytic Metal Oxide Nanoparticles for Phase Transfer and Self&#8208;Assembly Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transferred to film: The selectivity in ligand functionalization of photocatalytic metal oxide nanoparticles namely has been demonstrated for thiol (dodecane&#8208;1&#8208;thiol) and amine (oleylamine) terminated ligands. The success of polar&#8208;to&#8208;nonpolar phase transfer of the nanoparticles is consistent with the ligand&#8208;nanoparticle selectivity. The hydrophobic functionalized nanoparticles can be self&#8208;assembled at the air&#8208;water interface for thin&#8208;film applications.







Abstract
The functionalization of photocatalytic metal oxide nanoparticles of TiO2, ZnO, WO3 and CuO with amine&#8208;terminated (oleylamine) and thiol&#8208;terminated (dodecane&#8208;1&#8208;thiol) alkyl&#8208;chain ligands was studied under ambient conditions. A high selectivity was observed in the binding specificity of a ligand towards nanoparticles of these different oxides. It was observed that oleylamine binds stably to only TiO2 and WO3, whereas dodecane&#8208;1&#8208;thiol binds stably only to ZnO and CuO. Similarly, polar&#8208;to&#8208;nonpolar solvent phase transfer of TiO2 and WO3 nanoparticles could be achieved by using oleylamine, but not dodecane&#8208;1&#8208;thiol, whereas the opposite holds for ZnO and CuO. The surface chemistry of ligand&#8208;functionalized nanoparticles was probed by attenuated total reflectance (ATR)&#8208;FTIR spectroscopy, which enabled the occupation of the ligands at the active sites to be elucidated. The photostability of the ligands on the nanoparticle surface was determined by the photocatalytic self&#8208;cleaning properties of the material. Although TiO2 and WO3 degrade the ligands within 24&#8197;h under both UV and visible light, ligands on ZnO and CuO remain unaffected. The gathered insights are also highly relevant from an application point of view. As an example, because the ligand&#8208;functionalized nanoparticles are hydrophobic in nature, they can be self&#8208;assembled at the air&#8208;water interface to give nanoparticle films with demonstrated photocatalytic as well as anti&#8208;fogging properties.

     alt="Selectivity in the Ligand Functionalization of Photocatalytic Metal Oxide Nanoparticles for Phase Transfer and Self-Assembly Applications"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transferred to film&lt;/b&gt;: The selectivity in ligand functionalization of photocatalytic metal oxide nanoparticles namely has been demonstrated for thiol (dodecane-1-thiol) and amine (oleylamine) terminated ligands. The success of polar-to-nonpolar phase transfer of the nanoparticles is consistent with the ligand-nanoparticle selectivity. The hydrophobic functionalized nanoparticles can be self-assembled at the air-water interface for thin-film applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The functionalization of photocatalytic metal oxide nanoparticles of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ZnO, WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CuO with amine-terminated (oleylamine) and thiol-terminated (dodecane-1-thiol) alkyl-chain ligands was studied under ambient conditions. A high selectivity was observed in the binding specificity of a ligand towards nanoparticles of these different oxides. It was observed that oleylamine binds stably to only TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, whereas dodecane-1-thiol binds stably only to ZnO and CuO. Similarly, polar-to-nonpolar solvent phase transfer of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles could be achieved by using oleylamine, but not dodecane-1-thiol, whereas the opposite holds for ZnO and CuO. The surface chemistry of ligand-functionalized nanoparticles was probed by attenuated total reflectance (ATR)-FTIR spectroscopy, which enabled the occupation of the ligands at the active sites to be elucidated. The photostability of the ligands on the nanoparticle surface was determined by the photocatalytic self-cleaning properties of the material. Although TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; degrade the ligands within 24&#8197;h under both UV and visible light, ligands on ZnO and CuO remain unaffected. The gathered insights are also highly relevant from an application point of view. As an example, because the ligand-functionalized nanoparticles are hydrophobic in nature, they can be self-assembled at the air-water interface to give nanoparticle films with demonstrated photocatalytic as well as anti-fogging properties.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Tailored Mobility in a Zeolite Imidazolate Framework (ZIF) Antibody Conjugate**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Framing an assay: We present nanosized zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) conjugated to immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by using a strong and flexible covalent amino&#8208;alkyl link. These nanoZIF&#8208;IgG particles display good mobility and an excellent behaviour in dispersion. Their application to antibody&#8208;based bioanalytical assays, including enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), was examined.







Abstract
Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) hybrid fluorescent nanoparticles and ZIF antibody conjugates have been synthesized, characterized, and employed in lateral&#8208;flow immunoassay (LFIA). The bright fluorescence of the conjugates and the possibility to tailor their mobility gives a huge potential for diagnostic assays. An enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as label, proved the integrity, stability, and dispersibility of the antibody conjugates, LC&#8208;MS/MS provided evidence that a covalent link was established between these metal&#8208;organic frameworks and lysine residues in IgG antibodies.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Adaptability and Redox&#8208;Switching Properties of a Di&#8208;Gold Metallotweezer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A di&#8208;gold metallo&#8208;tweezer is used as receptor of a series of electron&#8208;deficient planar organic guests, including three organic molecules and two square&#8208;planar metal complexes. The host adapts its shape to maximize the attractive interaction with the guests. Redox&#8208;active guests are released upon one electron reduction, thus this tweezer constitutes an interesting example of redox&#8208;switchable binding.







Abstract
The use of a carbazolyl&#8208;connected di&#8208;gold(I) metallotweezer for the encapsulation of several electron&#8208;poor organic substrates, and a planar Au(III) complex containing a CNC pincer ligand, is described. The binding affinity of the receptor depends on the electron&#8208;deficient character of the planar guest, with larger association constants found for the more electron&#8208;poor guests. The X&#8208;ray diffraction molecular structures of two host:guest adducts show that the host approaches its arms in order to facilitate the optimum interaction with the surface of the planar guests, in a clear example of an guest&#8208;induced fit conformational arrangement. The electrochemical studies of the encapsulation of N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;naphthalenetetracarboxy diimide (NTCDI) show that the redox active guest is released from the receptor upon one electron reduction, thus constituting an example of redox&#8208;switchable binding.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendritic&#8208;like hole transporting materials for perovskite solar cells have been prepared by functionalization of a clickable pillar[5]arene core with triarylamine dendrons. Importantly, the apparent structural complexity of the resulting compounds is not associated to a difficult synthesis which is a major advantage for applications in the field of organic electronic materials. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Collavini, S. Seki, J.&#8208;F. Nierengarten, A. Abate, J.&#8197;L. Delgado, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101110).

Abundant edges (coordinatively unsaturated sites, steps, and corners), defects (twins), and mesopores exhibited in the metallic ultrathin structures. The formation mechanism for porous Pd nanomesh disclosed that they undergo the oriented attachment growth along &lt;111&gt; direction.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processing of Topochemically Converted Layered WO3 for Multifunctional Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solution processing of nanomaterials is a promising technique to utilize in various applications owing to its simplicity and scalability. However, the studies on liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) of tungsten oxide (WO3) are limited, unlike others due to lack of commercial availability of bulk WO3 with layered structures. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step topochemical synthesis approach to obtain bulk layered WO3 from commercially available layered tungsten disulfide (WS2) by optimizing various parameters like reaction time and temperature. Detailed microscopic and spectroscopic techniques have confirmed the conversion process. Further, LPE has been carried out on topochemically converted bulk layered WO3 in twenty&#8208;two different solvents, and among studied solvents isopropyl alcohol&#8208;water (1:1) co&#8208;solvent system appears to be the best. This indicates that the possible values of surface tension and Hansen solubility parameters for bulk WO3 could be close to that of co&#8208;solvent system. The obtained WO3 dispersions in a low boiling point solvent enable to fabricate thin films with varying thickness using spray deposition method. The obtained thin films are used as active materials in supercapacitors without any conductive additives/binders and exhibited an areal capacitance of 31.7 mF cm&#8208;2 at 5 mV s&#8208;1. The photoelectrochemical measurements reveal that these thin films can also be used as photoanodes for photoelectrochemical water oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Silver&#8208;Free Au(I) Catalysis Enabled by Bifunctional Urea&#8208; and Squaramide&#8208;Phosphine Ligands via H&#8208;Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A library of gold(I) chloride complexes with phosphine ligands incorporating pendant (thio)urea and squaramide H&#8208;bond donors was prepared with the aim of promoting chloride abstraction from Au(I) via H&#8208;bonding. In the absence of silver additives, complexes bearing squaramides and trifluoromethylated aromatic ureas displayed good catalytic activity in the cyclization of N&#8208;propargyl benzamides, as well as in a 1,6&#8208;enyne cycloisomerization, a tandem cyclization&#8208;indole addition reaction and the hydrohydrazination of phenylacetylene. Kinetic studies and DFT calculations indicate that the energetic span of the reaction is accounted by both the chloride abstraction step, facilitated by the bidentate H&#8208;bond donor via an associative mechanism, and the subsequent cyclization step.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Positive Materials for Magnesium Batteries: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mg cell is one of the promising candidate to replace to Li&#8208;ion batteries thanks to its advantages such as more abundance, cheaper and most importantly, the safety for the users. Positive electrode study is an important field in its development. Not only inorganic materials, but also the organic positive electrode research remains a major challenge to its potential use. Therefore, in this review, studies on organic positive electrodes in Mg batteries so far will be generalized.







Abstract
Magnesium batteries, like lithium&#8208;ion batteries, with higher abundance and similar efficiency, have drawn great interest for large&#8208;scale applications such as electric vehicles, grid energy storage and many more. On the other hand, the use of organic electrode materials allows high energy&#8208;performance, metal&#8208;free, environmentally friendly, versatile, lightweight, and economically efficient magnesium storage devices. In particular, the structural diversity and the simple activity of organic molecules make redox properties, and hence battery efficiency, easy to monitor. While organic magnesium batteries still in their infancy, this field becomes more and more promising because significant results were reported. To summarize the achievements in studies on organic cathodes for magnesium systems, their synthesis is discussed, combined with electrode design to provide the basis for controlling the electrochemical properties. Moreover, the techniques to synthesize organic materials with high&#8208;yield are mentioned. Finally, potential problems and prospects are explored to further improve organic cathodes.

         <title>Cs4B4O3F10: First Fluorooxoborate with [BF4] Involving Heteroanionic Units and Extremely Low Melting Point</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new congruently melting borate Cs4B4O3F10 has been synthesized as the first fluorooxoborate with [BF4] involving heteroanionic units, which possesses two highly fluorinated anionic clusters and therefore its formula can be expressed as Cs3(B3O3F6)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Cs(BF4). More importantly, Cs4B4O3F10 shows the lowest melting point among all the available borates and thus sets a new record for such system.







Abstract
Herein, a new congruently melting mixed&#8208;anion compound Cs4B4O3F10 has been characterized as the first fluorooxoborate with [BF4] involving heteroanionic units. Compound Cs4B4O3F10 possesses two highly fluorinated anionic clusters and therefore its formula can be expressed as Cs3(B3O3F6)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Cs(BF4). The influence of [BF4] units on micro&#8208;symmetry and structural evolution was discussed based on the parent compound. More importantly, Cs4B4O3F10 shows the lowest melting point among all the available borates and thus sets a new record for such system. This work is of great significance to enrich and tailor the structure of borates using perfluorinated [BF4] units.

         <title>Using Small Molecules to Enhance P450 OleT Enzyme Activity in Situ</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of small molecules was reported to enhance the catalytic efficiency of P450 OleTSA by interaction with the enzyme active center. Up to 6&#8208;fold increase of terminal alkenes yield has been achieved in the small molecule stimulated enzymatic reactions.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450 OleT is a fatty acid decarboxylase that catalyzes the production of olefins with biofuel and synthetic applications. However, the relatively sluggish catalytic efficiency of the enzyme limits its applications. Here, we report the application of a novel class of benzene containing small molecules to improve the OleT activity. The UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy study and molecular docking results confirmed the high proximity of the small molecules to the heme group of OleT. Up to 6&#8208;fold increase of product yield has been achieved in the small molecule&#8208;modulated enzymatic reactions. Our work thus sheds the light to the application of small molecules to increase the OleT catalytic efficiency, which could be potentially used for future olefin productions.

         <title>Indium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;F Bond Transformation through Oxymetalation/&#946;&#8208;Fluorine Elimination to Access Fluorinated Isocoumarins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorinated isocoumarin (depicted as a gladiator&#8242;s shield in the cover image) is transformed from a gem&#8208;difluoroalkene (wood shield) by virtue of the cool property of an indium catalyst (shooting star). Both fluorinated heterocycles and isocoumarins are alluring structural motifs, and we developed a comprehensive and novel strategy for the synthesis of fluorinated isocoumarins. Indium salts possess a moderate Lewis&#8208;acidity and affinity with gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and both properties accomplished the reaction system. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Y. Nishimoto, M. Yasuda et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100672).

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Oxo Clusters with Bi&#8208; and Tridentate Organic Ligands &#8211; Gradual Evolution of the Structures from Small to Big</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Homometallic titanium oxo clusters are one of the most important groups of metal oxo clusters, with more than 300 examples characterized by X&#8208;ray structure analyses. Most of them are uncharged and are obtained by partial hydrolysis and condensation of titanium alkoxo derivatives. The cluster cores, ranging from 3 to &gt;50 titanium atoms, are stabilized by organic ligands. Apart from residual OR groups, carboxylato and phosphonato ligands are most frequent. The article critically reviews and categorizes the known structures and works out basic construction principles by comparing the different cluster types.</dc:description>

         <title>The Stronger the Better: Donor Substituents Push Catalytic Activity of Molecular Chromium Olefin Polymerization Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The donor strength of bifunctional pyridine&#8208;cyclopentadienyl ligands was altered systematically by the introduction of donating groups in the  para  &#8208;position of the pyridine. In the resulting chromium complexes an almost linear correlation between donor strength and the nitrogen&#8208;chromium distance as well as the electronic absorption maximum is experimentally observed. The connection of electron&#8208;donating groups in the ligand backbone leads to an efficient transfer of the electronic influences to the catalytically active metal center without restricting it through steric effects. Therefore, catalytic olefin polymerization activity, which is already very high for the previously studied catalysts, increase considerably by attaching para&#8208;amino groups to the chelating pyridine or quinoline, respectively. Combining electron rich indenyl ligands with para&#8208;amino substituted pyridines lead to the highest catalytic activities observed so far for this class of organo chromium olefin polymerisation catalysts. The resulting polymers are of ultra high molecular weight and the ability of the catalysts to incorporate co&#8208;monomer is also very high.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Chlorination of 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;tellurazole&#8208;2&#8208;oxide yielded the&#160;&#955;4 Te&#160;dichloro derivative. Its crystal structure demonstrates that the heterocycle retains its ability to autoassociate by chalcogen bonding (ChB) forming macrocyclic tetramers. The corresponding Te&#8230;O ChB distances are 2.062&#160;&#197;, the shortest observed to date in aggregates of this type. DFT&#8208;D3 calculations indicate that while the halogenated molecule is stronger as a ChB donor it also is a weaker ChB acceptor; the overall effect is that the ChBs in the chlorinated homotetramer are not significantly stronger. However, partial halogenation or scrambling selectively yield the 2:2 heterotetramer with alternating&#160;&#955;4 Te and&#160;&#955;2 Te centers, which calculations identified as the thermodynamically preferred arrangement.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Plasmonic Au&#8211;Cu2&#8211;xS Nanocomposites: Design Strategies and Photothermal Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coupling two different materials to create a hybrid nanostructured system is a powerful strategy for achieving synergistically enhanced properties and advanced functionalities. In the case of Au and Cu  2&#8211;  x  S, their combination at the nanoscale results in dual plasmonic Au&#8211;Cu  2&#8211;  x  S nanocomposites that exhibit intense photon absorption in both the visible and the near&#8208;infrared spectral range. Their strong light&#8208;absorbing property translates to superior photothermal transduction efficiency, rendering them attractive in photothermal&#8208;based applications. There are several nanostructure configurations that are possible for the Au&#8211;Cu  2&#8211;  x  S system, and the successful fabrication of a particular architecture often requires a carefully planned synthetic strategy. In this Minireview, we present the different synthetic approaches that can be employed to produce rationally designed Au&#8211;Cu  2&#8211;  x  S nanocomposites, with focus on the experimental protocols that can lead to heterodimer, core&#8722;shell, reverse core&#8722;shell, and yolk&#8722;shell configurations. We also discuss the photothermal behavior of these materials and provide a glimpse of their potential use as photothermally active agents in therapeutic and theranostic applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;resorcin[4]arene&#8208;based inorganic&#8722;organic complexes are a kind of potential multifunctional materials for their adjustable structures and diverse functions. They have potentials applications for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Additionally, the relationship between different coordinated metal ions and electrochemical performance was also rarely investigated. Herein, three functionalized POM&#8208;resorcin[4]arene&#8208;based inorganic&#8722;organic materials, [Co2(TMR4A)2(H2O)10][SiW12O40]&#183;2EtOH&#183;4.5H2O (1), [Ni2(TMR4A)2(H2O)10][SiW12O40]&#183;4EtOH&#183;13H2O (2) and [Zn2(TMR4A)2(H2O)10][SiW12O40]&#183;2EtOH&#183;2H2O (3), have been synthesized. Further, to enhance the conductivities of these compounds, 1&#8208;3 were doped with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) to gain composites 1@RGO&#8208;3@RGO, respectively. As anode materials for LIBs, 1@RGO&#8208;3@RGO can deliver very high discharge capacities (1445.9, 1285.0 and 1095.3 mAh g&#8722;1, respectively) in the initial run, and show the discharge capacities of 898, 665 and 651 mAh g&#8722;1 at the current density of 0.1 A g&#8722;1 over 100 runs, respectively. More importantly, the discharge capacities of 319, 283 and 329 mAh g&#8722;1 were still maintained for 1@RGO&#8208;3@RGO even after 400 cycles at the large current density (1 A g&#8722;1).</dc:description>

         <title>A Disulfide Switch Providing Absolute Handedness Control in Double Helices via Conversion from the Antiparallel to Parallel Helical Pattern</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A strategy to reversibly switch the parallel/antiparallel helical conformation of aromatic double helices through the formation/breakage of a disulfide bond is presented. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures, NMR, and circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrate that the double helices with terminal thiol groups favor an antiparallel helical arrangement both in the solid state and in solution, while the  P  /  M  bias of helicity induced by chiral segments from another extremity of the sequence is weak in this structural motif. The antiparallel helices can be rearranged to parallel helices through the disulfide connection of the sequences. This in turn enhances the bias of helical handedness and results in absolute chirality control of the double helices. The handedness mediated process can be governed by the oxidation&#8208;reduction cycle, thereby switching the structural arrangement and the enhancement of chiral bias. In addition, we find that the sequences can dimerize into an intermolecular double helix with the disulfide connection. And the helical handedness is also fully controlled due to the head&#8208;to&#8208;head structural motif.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A strategy to reversibly switch the parallel/antiparallel helical conformation of aromatic double helices through the formation/breakage of a disulfide bond is presented. Single-crystal X-ray structures, NMR, and circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrate that the double helices with terminal thiol groups favor an antiparallel helical arrangement both in the solid state and in solution, while the  P  /  M  bias of helicity induced by chiral segments from another extremity of the sequence is weak in this structural motif. The antiparallel helices can be rearranged to parallel helices through the disulfide connection of the sequences. This in turn enhances the bias of helical handedness and results in absolute chirality control of the double helices. The handedness mediated process can be governed by the oxidation-reduction cycle, thereby switching the structural arrangement and the enhancement of chiral bias. In addition, we find that the sequences can dimerize into an intermolecular double helix with the disulfide connection. And the helical handedness is also fully controlled due to the head-to-head structural motif.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Electrophilic anions of type [B12X11]&#8208;  posses a vacant positive boron binding site within the anion. In a comparatitve experimental and theoretical study the reactivity of [B12X11]&#8208;  with X&#160;=&#160;F, Cl, Br, I, CN is characterized towards different nucleophiles: (i) noble gases (NGs) as &#963;&#8208;donors and (ii) CO/N2  as &#963;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptors.

The observed order is explained by an interplay of the electron deficiency of the vacant boron site in [B12X11  ]&#8208;  and steric effects.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic anion transporters show much promise as potential anti&#8208;cancer agents and therapeutics for diseases associated with mis&#8208;regulation of protein anion channels. In such applications high activity and anion selectivity are crucial to overcome competing proton or hydroxide transport which dissipates cellular pH gradients. Here we report highly active bidentate halogen bonding and chalcogen bonding anion carriers based on electron deficient iodo&#8208; and telluromethyl&#8208;triazole derivatives. Anion transport experiments in lipid bilayer vesicles reveal record nanomolar chloride transport activity for the bidentate halogen bonding anion carrier, and remarkably high chloride over proton/hydroxide selectivity for the chalcogen bonding anionophore. Computational studies provide further insight into the role of sigma&#8208;hole mediated anion recognition and desolvation at the membrane interface. Comparison with hydrogen bonding analogues demonstrates the importance of employing sigma&#8208;hole donor motifs in synthetic anionophores for achieving both high transport activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultimate Corrosion to Pt&#8208;Cu Electrocatalysts for Enhancing Methanol Oxidation Activity and Stability in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acid tested: An ultimate corrosion method to Pt&#8722;Cu electrocatalysts is presented that greatly promotes electrocatalytic activity and stability for methanol oxidation under acidic conditions. The formation mechanism has been investigated, and a mesostructured re&#8208;formation and atomic re&#8208;organization process is proposed. Our method could potentially be extended to the facile synthesis of highly acid stable Pt&#8208;based alloys with excellent electrocatalytic performance.







Abstract
Alloying platinum (Pt) with transition metals (M), as an established class of electrocatalysts, reduces the use of Pt and improves the electrocatalytic performance. However, the stability of transition metals in nanostructured platinum alloys is a fundamental and practical problem in electrocatalysis, due to leaching of transition metals under acidic operating condition. Here, a corrosion method has been developed for a Pt&#8722;Cu electrocatalyst with high activity (6.6 times that of commercial Pt/C) and excellent stability for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) under acidic operating conditions. The mechanism of formation has been studied, and possible mesostructured re&#8208;formation and atomic re&#8208;organization have been proposed. This work offers an effective strategy for the facile synthesis of a highly acid&#8208;stable PtM alloying and opens a door to high&#8208;performance design for electrocatalysts.

         <title>The Most Active Oxidase&#8208;Mimicking Mn2O3 Nanozyme for Biosensor Signal Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn2O3 nanoparticles have the highest oxidase&#8208;like activity among the tested metal oxides, but the activity is inhibited by H2O2. Mn3O4 behaves similarly, while the activity of MnO2 is enhanced by H2O2.







Abstract
Oxidase&#8208;mimicking nanozymes are more desirable than peroxidase&#8208;mimicking ones since H2O2 can be omitted. However, only a few nanomaterials are known for oxidase&#8208;like activities. In this work, we compared the activity of Mn2O3, Mn3O4 and MnO2 and found that Mn2O3 had the highest oxidase activity. Interestingly, the activity of Mn2O3 was even inhibited by H2O2. The oxidase&#8208;like activity of Mn2O3 was not much affected by the presence of proteins such as bovine serum albumin (BSA), but the physisorption of antibodies to Mn2O3 was not strong enough to withstand the displacement by BSA. We then treated Mn2O3 with 3&#8208;aminopropyltriethoxysilane to graft an amine group, which was used to conjugate antibodies using glutaraldehyde as a crosslinker. A one&#8208;step indirect competitive ELISA (icELISA) was developed for the detection of isocarbophos, and an IC50 of 261.7&#8197;ng/mL was obtained, comparable with the results of the standard two&#8208;step assay using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)&#8208;labeled antibodies. This assay has the advantage of significant timesaving for rapid detection of large amounts of samples. This work has discovered a highly efficient oxidase&#8208;mimicking nanozyme useful for various nano&#8208; and analytical applications.

         <title>Organometallic Molecular Wires with Thioacetylene Backbones, trans&#8208;{RS&#8208;(C&#8801;C)n}2Ru(phosphine)4: High Conductance through Non&#8208;Aromatic Bridging Linkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The scanning tunneling microscope break&#8208;junction study of thioacetylene ruthenium molecular wires exhibited single&#8208;molecule conductance higher than that of the related organometallic wires indicating the superiority of the acetylene bridging linkers as well as the thioether coordination anchor groups. The DFT non&#8208;equilibrium Green's function study supports the high conductance of the thioacetylene molecular wires, for which HOMOs are the dominant conductance pathways.







Abstract
In this work, the design, synthesis, and single&#8208;molecule conductance of ethynyl&#8208; and butadiynyl&#8208;ruthenium molecular wires with thioether anchor groups [RS=n&#8208;C6H13S, p&#8208;tert&#8208;Bu&#8722;C6H4S), trans&#8208;{RS&#8722;(C&#8801;C)n}2Ru(dppe)2 (n=1 (1R), 2 (2R); dppe: 1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane) and trans&#8208;(n&#8208;C6H13S&#8722;C&#8801;C)2Ru{P(OMe)3}4 3hex] are reported. Scanning tunneling microscope break&#8208;junction study has revealed conductance of the organometallic molecular wires with the thioacetylene backbones higher than that of the related organometallic wires having arylethynylruthenium linkages with the sulfur anchor groups, trans&#8208;{p&#8208;MeS&#8722;C6H4&#8208;(C&#8801;C)n}2Ru(phosphine)4 4n (n=1, 2) and trans&#8208;(Th&#8722;C&#8801;C)2Ru(phosphine)4 5 (Th=3&#8208;thienyl). It should be noted that the molecular junctions constructed from the butadiynyl wire 2R, trans&#8208;{Au&#8722;RS&#8722;(C&#8801;C)2}2Ru(dppe)2 (Au: gold metal electrode), show conductance comparable to that of the covalently linked polyynyl wire with the similar molecular length, trans&#8208;{Au&#8722;(C&#8801;C)3}2Ru(dppe)2 63. The DFT non&#8208;equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) study supports the highly conducting nature of the thioacetylene molecular wires through HOMO orbitals.

CASTing call: A semi&#8208;rational combinatorial active&#8208;site saturation test (CAST) was performed to improve the C&#946; stereoselectivity of threonine aldolase. MD simulations suggested that the Y314R variant could interact with 4&#8208;methylsulfonyl benzaldehyde through hydrogen bonding to control the direction of entry of substrate, this increased the de value from 58 to 81&#8201;%.







Abstract
l&#8208;Threonine aldolase from Actinocorallia herbida (AhLTA) is an ideal catalyst for producing l&#8208;threo&#8208;4&#8208;methylsulfonylphenylserine [(2S,3R)&#8208;1&#8201;b], a key chiral precursor for florfenicol and thiamphenicol. The moderate C&#946; stereoselectivity is the main obstacle to the industrial application of AhLTA. To address this issue, a combinatorial active&#8208;site saturation test (CAST) together with sequence conservatism analysis was applied to engineer the AhLTA toward improved C&#946; stereoselectivity. The optical mutant Y314R could asymmetrically synthesize l&#8208;threo&#8208;4&#8208;methylsulfonylphenylserine with 81&#8201;% diastereomeric excess (de), which is 23&#8201;% higher than wild&#8208;type AhLTA. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations revealed that the mechanism for the improvement in C&#946; stereoselectivity of Y314R is due to the acylamino group of residues Arg314 controlling the orientation of substrate 4&#8208;methylsulfonyl benzaldehyde (1&#8201;a) in the active pocket by directed interaction with the methylsulfonyl group; this leads to asymmetric synthesis of l&#8208;threo&#8208;4&#8208;methylsulfonylphenylserine. The success in this study demonstrates that direct control of substrates in an active pocket is an attract strategy to address the C&#946; stereoselectivity problem of LTA and contribute to the industrial application of LTA.

A one&#8208;step scalable template/solvent&#8208;free pyrolysis strategy for in&#8197;situ immobiliziation of CoP nanoparticles with high uniformity and dispersity onto N and P co&#8208;doped carbon porous nanosheets, is demonstrated. Thanks to the compositional and structural advantages, the prepared CoP@N,P&#8208;CNSs sample exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic HER performance and extraordinary long&#8208;term stability in alkaline medium.







Abstract
The search for economical, active and stable electrocatalysts towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is highly imperative for the progression of water electrolysis technology and related sustainable energy conversion technologies. The delicate optimization of chemical composition and architectural configuration is paramount to design high&#8208;efficiency non&#8208;precious metal HER electrocatalysts. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step scalable template/solvent&#8208;free pyrolysis approach for in&#8197;situ immobilizing uniform CoP nanoparticles onto N and P co&#8208;doped carbon porous nanosheets (denoted as CoP@N,P&#8208;CNSs hereafter). The simultaneous consideration of architectural design and nanocarbon hybridization renders the formed CoP@N,P&#8208;CNSs with plentiful well&#8208;dispersed anchored active sites, shortened pathway for mass diffusion, enhanced electric conductivity, and reinforced mechanical stability. As a consequence, the optimized CoP@N,P&#8208;CNSs exhibit an overpotential of 115&#8197;mV to afford a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, small Tafel slope of 74.2&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, high Faradaic efficiency of nearly 100&#8201;%, and superb long&#8208;term durability in an alkaline medium. Given the fabrication feasibility, mass production potential and outstanding HER performance, the CoP@N,P&#8208;CNSs may hold great promise for large&#8208;scale electrochemical water splitting. More importantly, the explored one&#8208;step template/solvent&#8208;free pyrolysis methodology offers a feasible and versatile route to fabricate carbon nanosheet&#8208;based nanocomposites for diverse energy conversation&#8208;related applications.

         <title>Zinc&#8208; and Cadmium meso&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Isoporphyrins: Non&#8208;Aromatic NIR Dyes with Distinct Conformational Features</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new sign has risen in the porphyrin sky! Stable isoporphyrins can be produced as non&#8208;aromatic NIR dyes in yields up to 36% by a one&#8208;pot process. Non&#8208;planar distortion modes are the key to control the optical spectra and the occurrence of isomers by means of synthesis. For the first time, the redox chemistry of isoporphyrins was studied by electrochemical methods, which is significant with regard to potential applications in photovoltaics. The cover image shows the linear display of a zinc isoporphyrin as a constellation in the night sky of the northern hemisphere, between the constellations Orion and Big Dipper. In the foreground, the UV spectrum with the prominent NIR absorptions around 900&#8197;nm piles up as a mountain relief. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M. Br&#246;ring et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100686).

         <title>Organophotocatalytic Aerobic Oxygenation of Phenols in a Visible&#8208;Light Continuous&#8208;Flow Photoreactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of a customized continuous&#8208;flow photoreactor enabled a highly efficient aerobic oxygenation of phenols to provide benzoquinones and p&#8208;quinols. By using pressurized air as oxidant, ecologically benign solvents and low amounts of methylene blue as organophotocatalyst in combination with hyper red LEDs, excellent selectivity values and yields were obtained. The method is expected to improve sustainability for the production of a variety of crucial products and intermediates.







Abstract
A mild photocatalytic phenol oxygenation enabled by a continuous&#8208;flow photoreactor using visible light and pressurized air is described herein. Products for wide&#8208;ranging applications, including the synthesis of vitamins, were obtained in high yields by precisely controlling principal process parameters. The reactor design permits low organophotocatalyst loadings to generate singlet oxygen. It is anticipated that the efficient aerobic phenol oxygenation to benzoquinones and p&#8208;quinols contributes to sustainable synthesis.

         <title>Synthesis of Lignans Based on a Borate&#8208;mediated One&#8208;pot Sequential Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Coupling of Cyclic Boranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lignans are a kingdom of phytochemicals and have attracted much attention due to their structural variety and intriguing biological activities. Herein we report a unified synthetic approach to lignans that consisted of three phases: stereo&#8208;, substrate&#8208;, and skeletal&#8208;diversification. The approach was successfully applied to the syntheses of various lignans in a modular manner.







Abstract
Lignans are a group of polyphenolic phytochemicals that possess a large spectrum of chemical structures and biological activities. Here the syntheses of lignans &#8211; anwulignan, burseran, dehydroxycubebin, ruburisandrin B, and sesamin &#8211; are achieved based on a borate&#8208;mediated one&#8208;pot sequential Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling of cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;fused bicyclic boranes, which were prepared by diastereoselective cyclic hydroboration of exo&#8208;cyclic diene with cyclopentyl&#8208; and thexylboranes, respectively. A one&#8208;pot sequential Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling of each cyclic borate with various aryl bromides initiated by activation of the cyclic borane with the carbon nucleophile provided 2,3&#8208;dibenzylbutane derivatives with different aromatic substituents. Finally, the syntheses of naturally occurring lignans were accomplished in several steps from the products of Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling.

         <title>Redox Chemistry of Heterobimetallic Polypnictogen Triple&#8208;Decker Complexes &#8211; Rearrangement, Fragmentation and Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The redox chemistry of heterobimetallic triple&#8208;decker complexes (Fe/Co and Co/Ni) with polypnictogen ligands (E=P, As) was studied first by cyclic voltammetry and then experimentally. The complexes respond to the addition and withdrawal of electrons either by the rearrangement of the triple&#8208;decker geometry, by the fragmentation of the En ligand and/or by the exchange of {Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;M} fragments.







Abstract
The redox chemistry of the heterobimetallic triple&#8208;decker complexes [(Cp*Fe)(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co)(&#956;,&#951;5:&#951;4&#8208;E5)] (E=P (1), As (2), Cp*=1,2,3,4,5&#8208;pentamethyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl, Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;=1,2,4&#8208;tri&#8208;tertbutyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl) and [(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co)(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ni)(&#956;,&#951;3:&#951;3&#8208;E3)] (E=P (10), As (11)) was investigated. Compound 1 and 2 could be oxidized to the monocations 3 and 4 and further to the dications 5 and 6, while the initially folded cyclo&#8208;E5 ligand planarizes upon oxidation. The reduction leads to an opposite change in the geometry of the middle deck, which is now folded stronger into the direction of the other metal fragment (formation of monoanions 7 and 8). For the arsenic compound 8, a different behavior is found since a fragmentation into an As6 (9) and As3 ligand complex occurs. The Co and Ni triple&#8208;decker complexes 10 and 11 can be oxidized initially to the heterometallic monocations 12 and 13, which are not stable in solution and convert selectively into the homometallic nickel complexes 14 and 15 and the cobalt complexes 16 and 17. This behavior was further proven by the oxidation of [(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co)(Cp&#8242;&#8242;Ni)(&#956;,&#951;3:&#951;2&#8208;P3)] (19, Cp&#8242;&#8242;=1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tertbutyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl) comprising two different Cp ligands. The transfer of {CpRM} fragments can be suppressed when a {W(CO)5} unit is coordinated to the P3 ligand (20) prior to the oxidation and the mixed cobalt and nickel cation 21 can be isolated. The reduction of 10 and 11 yields the heterometallic monoanions 22 and 23, where no transfer of the {CpRM} fragments is observed.

The Co and Ni triple-decker complexes &lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;11&lt;/b&gt; can be oxidized initially to the heterometallic monocations &lt;b&gt;12&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt;, which are not stable in solution and convert selectively into the homometallic nickel complexes &lt;b&gt;14&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;15&lt;/b&gt; and the cobalt complexes &lt;b&gt;16&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;17&lt;/b&gt;. This behavior was further proven by the oxidation of [(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co)(Cp&#8242;&#8242;Ni)(&#956;,&#951;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;:&#951;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)] (&lt;b&gt;19&lt;/b&gt;, Cp&#8242;&#8242;=1,3-di-tertbutyl-cyclopentadienyl) comprising two different Cp ligands. The transfer of {Cp&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;M} fragments can be suppressed when a {W(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;} unit is coordinated to the P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ligand (&lt;b&gt;20&lt;/b&gt;) prior to the oxidation and the mixed cobalt and nickel cation &lt;b&gt;21&lt;/b&gt; can be isolated. The reduction of &lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;11&lt;/b&gt; yields the heterometallic monoanions &lt;b&gt;22&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;23&lt;/b&gt;, where no transfer of the {Cp&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;M} fragments is observed.&lt;/p&gt;

         <dc:description>
The electrochemical hydroboration of alkynes by using B2Pin2 as the boron source is reported. This reaction manifold was applied to a broad range of alkynes, giving the hydroboration products in good to excellent yields without the need of a metal catalyst or a hydride source. In addition, the mechanism of this transformation was study.







Abstract
Herein we reported the electrochemical hydroboration of alkynes by using B2Pin2 as the boron source. This unprecedented reaction manifold was applied to a broad range of alkynes, giving the hydroboration products in good to excellent yields without the need of a metal catalyst or a hydride source. This transformation relied on the possible electrochemical oxidation of an in&#8197;situ formed borate. This anodic oxidation performed in an undivided cell allowed the formation of a putative boryl radical, which reacted on the alkyne.

         <title>The Unusual Photochromic and Hydrochromic Switching Behavior of Cellulose&#8208;Embedded 1,8&#8208;Naphthalimide&#8208;Viologen Derivatives in the Solid&#8208;State</title>

         <dc:description>
Water and Light Triggered Chromic Switching! A series of emissive 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide&#8208;viologen dyads were found to exhibit unusual dual photochromic and hydrochromic switching behavior in the solid phase when embedded in a cellulose matrix. Relying on humidity&#8208;sensitive solid state fluorescence hydrochromism and photoreduction processes, the dyads could be cycled unidirectionally between three distinct chromic states. Mechanistic investigations provided new insights into the role of cellulose&#8208;stabilized viologen radical cations in the process.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive chromic materials such as photochromics, hydrochromics, thermochromics, and electrochromics have a long history of capturing the attention of scientists due to their potential industrial applications and novelty in popular culture. However, hybrid chromic materials that combine two or more stimuli&#8208;triggered color changing properties are not so well known. Herein, we report a design strategy that has led to a series of emissive 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide&#8208;viologen dyads which exhibit unusual dual photochromic and hydrochromic switching behavior in the solid&#8208;state when embedded in a cellulose matrix. This behavior manifests as reversible solid state fluorescence hydrochromism upon changes in atmospheric relative humidity (RH), and reversible solid state photochromism upon generation of a cellulose&#8208;stabilized viologen radical cation. In this design strategy, the bipyridinium unit serves as both a water&#8208;sensitive receptor for the hydrochromic fluorophore&#8208;receptor system, and a photochromic group, capable of eliciting its own visible colorimetric response, generating a fluorescence quenching radical cation with prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. These dyes can be inkjet&#8208;printed onto cellulose paper or drop&#8208;cast as cellulose powder&#8208;based films and can be unidirectionally cycled between three different states which can be characteristically visualized under UV light or visible light. The material's photochromism, hydrochromism, and underlying mechanism of action was investigated using computational analysis, dynamic vapor sorption/desorption isotherms, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and variable humidity UV&#8208;Vis adsorption and fluorescence spectroscopies.

         <title>Energetics of Competing Chiral Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accounting for defects: Subtle energetic differences (chiral mismatches and helix reversals) govern the stability of two competing helical structures and translate into a major change of the macroscopic properties of solutions of racemic versus enantiopure monomers.







Abstract
Chirality can have unexpected consequences including on properties other than spectroscopic. We show herein that a racemic mixture of bis&#8208;urea stereoisomers forms thermodynamically stable supramolecular polymers that result in a more viscous solution than for the pure stereoisomer. The origin of this macroscopic property was probed by characterizing the structure and stability of the assemblies. Both racemic and non&#8208;racemic bis&#8208;urea stereoisomers form two competing helical supramolecular polymers in solution: a double and a single helical structure at low and high temperature, respectively. The transition temperature between these assemblies, as probed by spectroscopic and calorimetric analyses, is strongly influenced by the composition (by up to 70&#8201;&#176;C). A simple model that accounts for the thermodynamics of this system, indicates that the stereochemical defects (chiral mismatches and helix reversals) affect much more the stability of single helices. Therefore, the heterochiral double helical structure predominates over the single helical structure (whilst the opposite holds for the homochiral structures), which explains the aforementioned higher viscosity of the racemic bis&#8208;urea solution. This rationale constitutes a new basis to tune the macroscopic properties of the increasing number of supramolecular polymers reported to exhibit competing chiral nanostructures.

         <title>Integrated Photoresponsive Alkaline Earth Metal Coordination Networks: Synthesis, Topology, Photochromism and Photoluminescence Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Now you see me: A series of alkaline earth metal coordination networks (&#8220;apples&#8221;) have been synthetizeOd from an amino acid&#8208;naphthalene diimide ligand (&#8220;trunk&#8221;) and Mg2+, Ca2+, and Sr2+ (&#8220;nutriment&#8221;). In addition to their photoluminescence turn&#8208;off toward drug molecules (&#8220;worms&#8221;), they have reusable photochromic properties that would enable them to be used as secret inks or ultraviolet detectors.







Abstract
Photoresponsive materials are a key part of the age of smart technology that have potential in a broad range of applications. Coordination networks (CNs) are widely used due to their designability and stability. In this work, three novel alkaline earth metal coordination networks (AEM&#8208;CNs): [Mg(CMNDI)(H2O)2], [Ca(CMNDI)(H2O)2]&#8901;H2O, and [Sr(CMNDI)(H2O)(DMF)] with fsl, cds, and scn topology nets were synthetized via N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(carboxymethyl)&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenediimide (H2CMNDI); the scn net is not found in the Reticular Chemistry Structure Resource or ToposPro. The reusable and sensitive photochromic properties of the three CNs enable them to be used as secret inks or ultraviolet detectors. In addition, the CNs also exhibited reusable photoluminescent turn&#8208;off toward the drug molecules, balsalazide disodium (Bal.) and colchicine (Col.), with good limits of detection of 0.16 and 0.70&#8197;&#956;M. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of a fluorescence sensor for Bal. Thus, the AEM&#8208;CNs provide a design idea for integrated photoresponsive materials that could be further improved in the near future by further study.

         <title>Dual Electroactivity in a Covalent Organic Network with Mechanically Interlocked Pillar[5]arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox active pillar[5]arene macrocycles are inserted via mechanical bonds in a viologen&#8208;based covalent organic network. Solid state electrochemical studies show that both n and p type redox centers are active on a relatively narrow potential range (&#8764;1&#8197;V). The presence of the pillar[5]arene macrocycles boosts the electroactivity of the solid in aqueous electrolyte.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of a polyrotaxanated covalent organic network (CON) based on the association between the viologen and pillar[5]arene (P[5]OH) units are reported. The mechanical bond allows for the irreversible insertion of n&#8208;type redox centers (P[5]OH macrocycles) within a pristine structure based on p&#8208;type viologen redox centers. Both redox units are active on a narrow potential range and, in water, the presence of P[5]OH greatly increases the electroactivity of the material.

         <title>An In&#8208;Situ Self&#8208;regeneration Catalyst for the Production of Renewable Penta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternative approach to the efficient production of penta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene: Bio&#8208;based hydrogenation of pentane&#8208;2,3&#8208;dione by a Pt/Ce/Al2O3 catalyst under mild conditions with a selectivity of 97&#8201;%, followed by dehydration by an urchin&#8208;like LaPO4 catalyst afforded penta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene in yield of 59&#8201;%. The LaPO4 self&#8208;regenerated during the dehydration owing to its ability to restore the active sites in&#8197;situ.







Abstract
Catalyst deactivation is a problem of great concern for many heterogeneous reactions. Here, an urchin&#8208;like LaPO4 catalyst was easily developed for pentane&#8208;2,3&#8208;diol dehydration; it has an impressive ability to restore the activity in&#8197;situ by itself during the reaction, accounting for its high stability. This facilitates the efficient production of renewable penta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene from pentane&#8208;2,3&#8208;dione via a novel approach, where penta&#8208;2,3&#8208;diol was obtained as an intermediate in 95&#8201;% yield under mild conditions.

         <title>Fulvalene&#8208;Based Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Ladder&#8208;Type Structures: Synthesis and Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiredox systems: Ladder&#8208;type structures can be obtained by connecting indenofluorene units via cross&#8208;conjugated fulvalene motifs. Placing such polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons between two dithiafulvenes provides multiredox systems that undergo reversible reductions and oxidations and that can hence exist in several charge states. Synthetic protocols for such &#8220;super&#8208;extended&#8221; tetrathiafulvalenes are presented together with redox, optical, and structural properties.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have found strong interest for their electronic properties and as model systems for graphene. While PAHs have been studied intensively as single units, here PAHs were constructed in ladder&#8208;type arrangements using cross&#8208;conjugated fulvalene and dithiafulvalene motifs as connecting units and moving forward a convenient synthetic approach for dimerizing (thio)ketones into olefins by the action of Lawesson's reagent. Some of the PAHs can also be regarded as &#8220;super&#8208;extended&#8221; tetrathiafulvalenes (TTFs) with some of the largest cores ever explored, being multi&#8208;redox systems that exhibit both reversible oxidations and reductions. Concomitant absorption redshifts were observed when expanding the ladder&#8208;type structures from one to two to three indenofluorene units, and optical and electrochemical HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps were found to correlate linearly. Various conformations (and solid&#8208;state packing arrangements) were studied by X&#8208;ray crystallography and computations.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature H2 Reduction of Copper Oxide Subnanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lowering of the CuII&#8594;CuI reduction temperature for subnano CuO particles (ca. 1&#8197;nm) was demonstrated, compared to the nanoparticles, which was monitored by in&#8197;situ XAFS H2&#8208;TPR experiments. The enhanced performance with a release of the atomic oxygen from the copper oxide is attributed to the surface&#8208;strained structure and the elongation of the Cu&#8722;O bonds.







Abstract
Subnanoparticles (SNPs) with sizes of approximately 1&#8197;nm are attractive for enhancing the catalytic performance of transition metals and their oxides. Such SNPs are of particular interest as redox&#8208;active catalysts in selective oxidation reactions. However, the electronic states and oxophilicity of copper oxide SNPs are still a subject of debate in terms of their redox properties during oxidation reactions for hydrocarbons. In this work, in&#8197;situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements of Cu28Ox SNPs, which were prepared by using a dendritic phenylazomethine template, during temperature&#8208;programmed reduction (TPR) with H2 achieved lowering of the temperature (T50=138&#8201;&#176;C) reported thus far for the CuII&#8594;CuI reduction reaction because of Cu&#8722;O bond elongation in the ultrasmall copper oxide particles.

         <title>Molecular Sieving of Acetylene from Ethylene in a Rigid Ultra&#8208;microporous Metal Organic Framework.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double (bond) take: The molecular sieving of C2H2 from C2H4 has been realized in a rigid ultra&#8208;microporous metal organic framework that enabled efficient one&#8208;step C2H4 production from the binary gas mixture C2H2/C2H4 and the ternary gas mixture C2H2/CO2/C2H4.







Abstract
Rigid molecular sieving materials are the ideal candidates for gas separation (e.&#8201;g., C2H2/C2H4) due to their ultrahigh adsorption selectivity and the absence of gas co&#8208;adsorption. However, the absolute molecular sieving effect for C2H2/C2H4 separation has rarely been realized because of their similar physicochemical properties. Herein, we demonstrate the absolute molecular sieving of C2H2 from C2H4 by a rigid ultra&#8208;microporous metal&#8208;organic framework (F&#8722;PYMO&#8722;Cu) with 1D regular channels (pore size of ca. 3.4&#8197;&#197;). F&#8722;PYMO&#8722;Cu exhibited moderate acetylene uptake (35.5&#8197;cm3/cm3), but very low ethylene uptake (0.55&#8197;cm3/cm3) at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar, yielding the second highest C2H2/C2H4 uptake ratio of 63.6 up to now. One&#8208;step C2H4 production from a binary mixture of C2H2/C2H4 and a ternary mixture of C2H2/CO2/C2H4 at 298&#8197;K was achieved and verified by dynamic breakthrough experiments. Coupled with excellent thermal and water stability, F&#8722;PYMO&#8722;Cu could be a promising candidate for industrial C2 separation tasks.

Coupled with excellent thermal and water stability, &lt;b&gt;F&#8722;PYMO&#8722;Cu&lt;/b&gt; could be a promising candidate for industrial C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Solvent Effects in Halogen and Hydrogen Bonding Mediated Electrochemical Anion Sensing in Aqueous Solution and at Interfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active ferrocenyl receptors enable electrochemical anion sensing in highly competitive aqueous solvent media, with a sensory performance that is markedly dependent on the nature of the non&#8208;covalent interaction. In solution, the halogen bonding sensor (XB) is superior and significantly less sensitive to solvent polarity, while surface immobilisation is associated with an enhanced performance, particularly for the hydrogen bonding (HB) system.







Abstract
Sensing anionic species in competitive aqueous media is a well&#8208;recognised challenge to long&#8208;term applications across a multitude of fields. Herein, we report a comprehensive investigation of the electrochemical anion sensing performance of novel halogen bonding (XB) and hydrogen bonding (HB) bis&#8208;ferrocene&#8208;(iodo)triazole receptors in solution and at self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs), in a range of increasingly competitive aqueous organic solvent media (ACN/H2O). In solution, the XB sensor notably outperforms the HB sensor, with substantial anion recognition induced cathodic voltammetric responses of the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple persisting even in highly competitive aqueous solvent media of 20&#8201;% water content. The response to halides, in particular, shows a markedly lower sensitivity to increasing water content associated with a unique halide selectivity at unprecedented levels of solvent polarity. The HB sensor, in contrast, generally displayed a preference towards oxoanions. A significant surface&#8208;enhancement effect was observed for both XB/HB receptive films in all solvent systems, whereby the HB sensor generally displayed larger responses towards oxoanions than its halogen bonding analogue.

         <title>An Ultrastable Crystalline Acylhydrazone&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient Removal of Organic Micropollutants from Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for the synthesis of ultra&#8208;stable acylhydrazone&#8208;linked COFs through reinforcing the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions between the adjacent layers with increased &#960;&#8208;surface is reported. It is surprising to found that the produced material exhibits extremely chemical stability in harsh environments, and could be used to effectively capture various organic micropollutants from water such as antibiotic and plastic components.







Abstract
As an important member of crystalline porous polymers, acylhydrazone&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have gained much attention in recent years. However, the low structural stability imparts a limit on their practical applications. To tackle this problem, we report a simple strategy to increase the chemical stability of acylhydrazone&#8208;linked COFs by incorporating azobenzene groups in the conjugated framework. Through reinforcing the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions between the adjacent layers with increased &#960;&#8208;surface, it is surprising to find that the resulting materials exhibit extreme stability in harsh environments, such as in strong acid, strong base, aqueous educing agent and boiling water, even exposed to air for one year. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, such frameworks have been used to remove various organic micropollutants such as antibiotics, plastic components, endocrine disruptors, and carcinogens from water with high capacity, fast speed and excellent reusability over a wide pH range at environmentally relevant concentrations. The results provide a new avenue to significantly enhance the stability of COFs for practical applications.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed a widely applicable approach to synthesize ketones, esters, amides via the oxidative C&#8208;C bond cleavage of readily available alkyl aldehydes. Green and abundant molecular oxygen (O  2  ) was used as the oxidant, and base metals (cobalt and copper) were used as the catalysts. This strategy can be extended to the one&#8208;pot synthesis of ketones from primary alcohols and &#945;&#8208;ketoamides from aldehydes.</dc:description>

         <title>Fabrication of Pd/Mg2P2O7 via a Struvite&#8208;template Way from Wastewater and Application as Chemoselective Catalyst in Hydrogenation of Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst Pd/ Mg  2  P  2  O  7&#160;  was fabricated by combining palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) and mesoporous Mg  2  P  2  O  7  fibers/rods. The Mg  2  P  2  O  7  fibers with ultra high specific surface area were prepared from struvite as templates which were synthesized from wastewater consisting of N&#8208; and P&#8208;containing pollutants. This strategy provided a novel pathway in developing advanced catalysts from eutrophication polluted water. The composite Pd/Mg  2  P  2  O  7  showed brilliant performance in selective hydrogenation of nitro&#8208;aromatics to get anilines. As an example of nitrobenzene hydrogenation, the conversion and selectivity to aniline were found to reach almost 100% at temperature of T=90&#176;C and under pressure of P  H2  =2.0 MPa. The superior performance was found to originate from Pd NPs which were boosted by electron transfer afforded by the nano&#8208;fibers Mg  2  P  2  O  7  supports. The favorable adsorption of withdrawing groups (&#8208;NO  2  ) was realized by synergistic effects between Pd and oxygen vacancies provided by pyrolysis of struvite. The catalyst remained stably after cycles of reuse with little degradation in catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Bench&#8208;Stable Electrophilic Fluorinating Reagents for Highly Selective Mono&#8208; and Difluorination of Silyl Enol Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient methods for the synthesis of fluorinated compounds have been intensively studied, recently. Development of practical fluorinating reagents is indispensable for this purpose. Herein, bench&#8208;stable electrophilic fluorinating reagents were synthesized as  N  &#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) substitutes. Reagents obtained by replacing one of the NFSI sulfonyl groups with an acyl group led to the highly selective monofluorination of silyl enol ethers with suppression of undesired overreaction, that is difluorination. On the other hand, reagents bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents at NFSI benzenesulfonyl groups efficiently facilitated the difluorination of silyl enol ethers under base&#8208;free conditions. Thus, both mono&#8208; and difluorinated target materials were prepared from the same substrate.</dc:description>

Development of practical fluorinating reagents is indispensable for this purpose. Herein, bench-stable electrophilic fluorinating reagents were synthesized as  N  -fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) substitutes. Reagents obtained by replacing one of the NFSI sulfonyl groups with an acyl group led to the highly selective monofluorination of silyl enol ethers with suppression of undesired overreaction, that is difluorination. On the other hand, reagents bearing electron-withdrawing substituents at NFSI benzenesulfonyl groups efficiently facilitated the difluorination of silyl enol ethers under base-free conditions. Thus, both mono- and difluorinated target materials were prepared from the same substrate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gelatin&#8208;derived 1&#8208;D Carbon Nanofiber Architecture with Simultaneous Decoration of Single Fe&#8208;Nx Sites and Fe/Fe3C Nanoparticles for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>

         <dc:description>Exploring high&#8208;performance non&#8208;precious metal electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is critical. Herein, we report a scalable and cost&#8208;effective strategy for the construction of one&#8208;dimensional (1&#8208;D) carbon nanofiber architecture with simultaneous decoration of single Fe&#8208;Nx sites and highly dispersed Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles for efficient ORR, through the Fe(III) complex assisted&#8208;electrospinning of gelatin nanofibers with subsequent pre&#8208;oxidation and carbonization. Results show that the presence of Fe(III) complex enables the 1&#8208;D gelatin nanofibers to be well retained during the pre&#8208;oxidation process. Owing to the distinct 1&#8208;D nanofiber structure and the synergistic effect of Fe/Fe3C and Fe&#8208;Nx sites, the resulting electrocatalyst is highly active for ORR with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.885 V (outperforming commercial Pt/C) and a superior electrochemical stability in alkaline electrolyte. Similarly, it also shows a high power density (144.7 mW cm&#8208;2) and a superior stability in Zn&#8208;air battery. This work opens a path for the design and synthesis of 1&#8208;D carbon electrocatalyst for efficient ORR catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Rethinking Borole Cycloaddition Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boroles are attracting broad interest for their myriad and diverse applications, including in synthesis, small&#8208;molecule activation and functional materials. Their properties and reactivity are closely linked to the cyclic conjugated diene system, which has been shown to participate in cycloaddition reactions, such as the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with alkynes. The reaction steps leading to boranorbornadienes, borepins and tricyclic boracyclohexenes from the thermal reaction of boroles with alkynes are seemingly well understood as judged from the literature. Herein, we question the long&#8208;established mechanistic picture of pericyclic rearrangements by demonstrating that seven&#8208;membered borepins (i.e. heptaphenylborepin and two derivatives substituted with a thienyl and chloride substituent on boron) exist in a dynamic equilibrium with the corresponding bicyclic boranorbornadienes, the direct Diels&#8208;Alder products, but are not isolable products from the reactions. Heating gradually converts the isomeric mixtures into fluorescent tricyclic boracyclohexenes, the most stable isomers in the series. Results from mechanistic DFT calculations reveal that the tricyclic compounds derive from the boranorbornadienes and not the borepins, which were previously believed to be intermediates in purely pericyclic processes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Redox&#8208;active Tetrazine&#8208;based Pincer Ligand for the Reduction of N&#8208;oxyanions Using a Redox&#8208;inert Metal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction chemistry of the bis&#8208;tetrazinyl pyridine ligand (btzp) towards nitrogen oxyanions coordinated to zinc is studied in order to explore the reduction of the NO  x  &#713; substrates with a redox&#8208;active ligand in the absence of redox activity at the metal. Following syntheses and characterization of (btzp)ZnX  2  for X = Cl, NO  3  and NO  2  , featuring O&#8208;Zn linkage of both nitrogen oxyanions, it is shown that a silylating agent selectively delivers silyl substituents to tetrazine nitrogens, without reductive deoxygenation of NO  x  &#8208;1  . A new synthesis of the highly hydrogenated H  4  btzp, containing two dihydrotetrazine reductants is described as is the synthesis and characterization of (H  4  btzp)ZnX  2  for X = Cl and NO  3  , both of which show considerable hydrogen bonding potential of the dihydrotetrazine ring NH groups. The (H  4  btzp)ZnCl  2  complex does not bind zinc in the pincer pocket, but instead H  4  btzp becomes a bridge between neighboring atoms through tetrazine nitrogen atoms, forming a polymeric chain. The reaction of AgNO  2  with (H  4  btzp)ZnCl  2  is shown to proceed with fast nitrite deoxygenation, yielding water and free NO. Half of the H  4  btzp reducing equivalents form Ag  0  and thus the chloride ligand remains coordinated to the zinc metal center to yield (btzp)ZnCl  2  . To compare with AgNO  2  , experiments of (H  4  btzp)ZnCl  2  with NaNO  2  result in salt metathesis between chloride and nitrite, highlighting the importance of a redox&#8208;active cation in the reduction of nitrite to NO.</dc:description>

         <title>Upper Critical Solution Temperature&#8208;Type Responsive Cyclodextrins with Characteristic Inclusion Abilities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;soluble and thermoresponsive macrocycles with stable inclusion toward guests are highly valuable to construct stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular materials for versatile applications. Here, we develop such macrocycles, ureido&#8208;substituted cyclodextrins (CDs) which exhibit unprecedented upper critical solution temperature (UCST) behavior in aqueous media. These novel CD derivatives showed good solubility in water at elevated temperature, but collapsed from water to form large coacervates upon cooling to low temperature. Their cloud points are dependent greatly on concentrations, and furthermore, can be mediated through oxidation and chelation with silver ion. Significantly, amphiphilicity of these CD derivatives is supportive to the host&#8208;guest binding, which afford them to retain inclusion abilities to guest dyes. The inclusion complexation remained nearly intact during thermally induced phase transitions, which makes contrast to the switchable inclusion behavior of lower critical solution temperature (LCST)&#8208;type CDs. Moreover, ureido&#8208;substituted CDs were exploited to coencapsulate a pair of guest dyes whose fluorescence resonance energy transfer process can be switched by the UCST phase transition. We therefore believe this novel thermoresponsive CDs may form a new strategy for developing smart macrocycles and allow for exploring smart supramolecular materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Functional Carbazole&#8208;Fullerene Complexes: A New Perspective of Carbazoles Acting as NanoOctopus to Capture Globular Fullerenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fullerene host&#8208;guest constructs have attracted increasing attention owing to their molecular&#8208;level hybrid arrangements. However, the usage of simple carbazolic derivatives to bind with fullerenes is rare. In this research, we rationally designed three novel carbazolic derivatives containing a tunable bridging linker and carbazole units for the capturing of fullerenes. Unlike the general concave&#8208;convex interactions, fullerenes could interact with the planar carbazole subunits to form 2&#8208;dimensional hexagonal/quadrilateral cocrystals with alternating stacking patterns of 1:1 or 1:2 stoichiometry, as well as the controllable fullerene packing modes. At the meanwhile, good electron&#8208;transporting performances and significant photovoltaic effects were realized when continuous C  60  &#183;&#183;&#183;C  60  interaction channel existed. Our results indicate that the introduction of such carbazolic system into fullerene receptor would provide us new insights into novel fullerene host&#8208;guest architectures for versatile applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Comparative Investigation into the Complexation and Extraction Properties of Tetradentate and Tridentate Phosphine Oxide Functionalized 1,10&#8208;Phenanthroline Ligands toward Lanthanides and Actinides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two new phosphine oxide functionized 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligands, tetradentate 2,9&#8208;bis(butylphenylphosphine oxide)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (BuPh&#8208;BPPhen, L1) and tridentate 2&#8208;(butylphenylphosphine oxide)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (BuPh&#8208;MPPhen, L2), were synthesized and studied comparatively for the coordination with trivalent actinides and lanthanides. The complexation mechanisms of these two ligands toward trivalent f&#8208;block elements were thoroughly elucidated by NMR spectroscopy, UV&#8208;vis spectrophotometry, fluorescence spectrometry, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, solvent extraction, and theoretical calculation methods. NMR titration results demonstrated that both 1:1 and 1:2 (metal to ligand) lanthanides complexes formed for L1 whereas 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 lanthanide complexes formed for L2 in methanol solution. The formation of these species were also validated by fluorescence spectrometry and the corresponding stability constants for the complexes of Nd(III) with L1 and L2 were determined using UV&#8208;vis spectrophotometry. Structures of the 10&#8208;coordinated 1:1&#8208;type complexes of EuL1(NO3)3 and [EuL2(NO3)3(H2O)]&#8231;Et2O in solid state were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. In solvent extraction experiments, L1 exhibited extremely strong extraction ability for both Am(III) and Eu(III) while L2 showed nearly no extraction toward Am(III) and Eu(III) due to its high hydrophilicity. Finally, the structures and bonding natures of those complexes species formed between Am(III)/Eu(III) and L1/L2 were analyzed using DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu/CuxS Embedded N,S&#8208;doped Porous Carbon In Situ Derived from a Novelly Designed MOF for Efficient Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reasonable design of the precursor of the carbon&#8208;based nanocatalyst is an important pathway to improve its catalytic performance. In this study, a simple solvothermal method was used to synthesize [Cu(TPT)(2,5&#8208;tdc)]&#183;2H  2  O (  Cu&#8208;MOF  ) containing N and S atoms in one step. Further in&#8208;situ carbonization of the  Cu&#8208;MOF  as the precursor was used to synthesize Cu/Cu  x  S embedded N,S&#8208;doped porous carbon (Cu/Cu  x  S/NSC) composites. The catalytic activities of the prepared Cu/Cu  x  S/NSC were investigated through catalytic reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol (4&#8208;NP) to 4&#8208;aminophenol (4&#8208;AP). The results show that the designed Cu/Cu  x  S/NSC has exceptional catalytic activity and recycle stability, showing the reaction rate constant is 0.0256 s  &#8208;1  , and the conversion rate still exceeds 90% after 15 cycles. Meanwhile, the efficient catalytic reduction of dyes (CR, MO, MB and RhB) confirmed its versatility. Finally, the active sites of the Cu/Cu  x  S/NSC catalysts were analyzed and a possible multi&#8208;component synergistic catalytic mechanism was proposed.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect has been widely studied in both small molecules and linear polymers. Covalently&#8208;bonded donor&#8208;acceptor pairs with tunable bandgaps and photoelectric properties endow these materials with potential applications in optoelectronics, fluorescent bioimaging, and sensors, etc. However, owing to the lack of charge transfer pathway or effective separation of charge carriers, unfavorable charge recombination gives rise to inevitable energy loss. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) can be mediated with various geometry&#8208; and property&#8208;tailored building blocks, where donor (D) and acceptor (A) segments are connected by covalent bonds and can be finely arranged to form highly ordered networks (namely D&#8208;A COFs). The unique structural features of D&#8208;A COFs render the formation of segregated D&#8208;A stacks, thus provides pathways and channels for effective charge carriers transport. This minireview highlights the significant progress on D&#8208;A COFs over the past decade with emphasis on design principles, growing structural diversities, and promising application potentials.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomic Layer Deposition of Ternary Indium/Tin/Aluminum Oxide Thin Films, their characterization and Transistor Performance under Illumination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multilayered heterostructures comprising of In  2  O  3  , SnO  2  , and Al  2  O  3  were studied for their application in thin&#8208;film transistors (TFT). The compositional influence of tin oxide on the properties of the thin&#8208;film, as well as on the TFT characteristics is investigated. The heterostructures are fabricated by atomic layer deposition (ALD) at 200&#176;C, employing trimethylindium (TMI), tetrakis(dimethylamino)tin (TDMASn), trimethylaluminum (TMA), and water as precursors.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Multilayered heterostructures comprising of In  2  O  3  , SnO  2  , and Al  2  O  3  were studied for their application in thin-film transistors (TFT). The compositional influence of tin oxide on the properties of the thin-film, as well as on the TFT characteristics is investigated. The heterostructures are fabricated by atomic layer deposition (ALD) at 200&#176;C, employing trimethylindium (TMI), tetrakis(dimethylamino)tin (TDMASn), trimethylaluminum (TMA), and water as precursors.

         <dc:description>Rate constants for the reactions of dialkyl chalcogenides with laser&#8208;flash photolytically generated benzhydrylium ions have been measured photometrically to integrate them in the comprehensive benzhydrylium&#8208;based nucleophilicity scale. The combination of these rate constants with the previously reported equilibrium constants for the same reactions provided the corresponding Marcus intrinsic barriers and made it possible to quantify the leaving group abilities (nucleofugalities) of dialkyl sulfides and dimethyl selenide. Due to the low intrinsic barriers, dialkyl chalcogenides are fairly strong nucleophiles (comparable to pyridine and  N  &#8208;methylimidazole) as well as good nucleofuges, which makes them useful group&#8208;transfer reagents.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Chiral Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alcohol addition reactions to cyclic carbonyl ylides generated from  N  &#8208;(&#945;&#8208;diazocarbonyl)&#8208;2&#8208;oxazolidinones featuring a dual catalytic system are reported. Construction of a chiral quaternary heteroatom&#8208;substituted carbon center was accomplished in which the unique heterobicycles were obtained in good yields with high stereoselection. The alcohol adducts were successfully converted to optically active oxazolidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones by hydrolysis. Mechanistic studies by DFT calculations revealed that alcohols could be activated by Lewis acids, enabling enantioselective protonation of the carbonyl ylides.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Application of Mini&#8208;libraries of the miRNA Probes for an Efficient and Versatile miRNA&#8208;mRNA Cross&#8208;linking</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MicroRNAs constitute a class of endogenous, non&#8208;coding RNAs having a great influence on various processes within the cell. By base&#8208;pairing to partially&#8208;complementary sites located in the 3&#8217; untranslated region of target messenger RNAs, microRNAs participate in the post&#8208;transcriptional regulation of the majority of human protein&#8208;coding genes and their dysregulation has been related to many pathological processes and diseases. Thus, an in&#8208;depth understanding of the microRNA mechanisms of action is crucial. Here, we present a new concept of probe design to achieve an efficient and sequence&#8208;independent miRNA&#8208;mRNA cross&#8208;linking. The new strategy is based on the utilization of a controlled mixture of probes for a chosen miRNA, in which the trioxsalen moiety is introduced at the  N  4  &#8208;position of a selected cytidine through short oligoethylene glycol&#8208;based linkers.  In vitro  photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking experiments with mini&#8208;libraries of probes for microRNAs of interest showed variable cross&#8208;linking efficiencies, giving strong evidence for the general applicability of the presented approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Methyl&#8208;induced Polarization Destabilizes Non&#8208;covalent Interactions of N&#8208;methylated Lysines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lysine methylation can modify non&#8208;covalent interactions by altering lysine's hydrophobicity as well as its electronic structure. While ramifications of the former are documented, the effects of the latter remain largely unknown. Understanding electronic structure is important for determining how biological methylation modulates protein&#8208;protein binding, and how artificial methylation impacts experiments in which methylated lysines are used as spectroscopic probes and protein crystallization facilitators. Benchmarked first principles calculations undertaken here reveal that methyl&#8208;induced polarization weakens electrostatic attraction of amines with protein functional groups &#8208; salt bridges, hydrogen bonds and cation&#8208;pi interactions weaken by as much as 10.3, 7.9 and 3.5&#160;kT, respectively. Multipole analysis shows that weakened electrostatics is due to altered inductive effects that overcome increased attraction from methyl&#8208;enhanced polarizability and dispersion. These effects, due to their fundamental nature, are expected to be present in many cases. Survey of methylated lysines in protein structures reveals several cases where methyl&#8208;induced polarization is the primary driver of altered non&#8208;covalent interactions, and in these cases destabilizations are found to be in the 0.6&#8208;4.7 kT range. The clearest case of where methyl&#8208;induced polarization plays a dominant role in regulating biological function is that of the PHD1&#8208;PHD2 domain that recognizes lysine methylated&#8208;states on histones. These results broaden our understanding of how methylation modulates non&#8208;covalent interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Theoretical Insight into the Effect of Fluorine&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Supported Palladium Single&#8208;Site Catalyst in the Ethylene Dimerization Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethylene dimerization reaction is one of the most common mechanisms for the production of 1&#8208;butene. Recently metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have received extensive attention in this area since they combine all the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts in a single compound. Here is reported a computational mechanistic study of MOF&#8208;supported palladium single&#8208;site catalyst for ethylene dimerization reaction. Catalytic systems with both biphenyl&#8208;type backbone as organic ligand and its fluorine&#8208;functionalization have been investigated to reveal the origin of ligand effects on the catalytic activity and selectivity. The calculations revealed that the nonfluorinated palladium MOF catalyst undergoes dimerization over isomerization reaction. Then the influence of the fluorine&#8208;functionalized organic ligand was compared in the dimerization catalytic cycle, which was strongly favored in terms of activity and selectivity. Catalyst&#8208;substrate interactions were analyzed by energy decomposition analysis revealing the critical role of ligand backbone functionalization on the activity. This theoretical analysis identified three chemically meaningful dominant effects on these catalysts; steric, electrostatic and charge transfer effects. The steric effects promote nonfluorinated MOF catalyst, whereas the electrostatic effects are the dominant factor that promotes its fluorinated counterpart. This theoretical study provides feedback with future experimental studies about the role of fluorine ligand functionalization in palladium MOF catalysts for ethylene dimerization reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Correlation between the dynamics of nanoconfined water and local chemical environments in calcium silicate hydrate nanominerals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Calcium silicate hydrates are members of a large family of minerals with layered structures containing hanging Ca&#8208;OH and Si&#8208;OH groups that interact with confined water molecules. To rationalize the impact of the local chemical environment on the dynamics of water, Si&#8208;OH&#8208;rich and Ca&#8208;OH&#8208;rich model nanocrystals were synthesized using the continuous supercritical hydrothermal method and then systematically studied by a combination of spectroscopic techniques. In our comprehensive analysis, the ultrafast relaxation dynamics of hanging hydroxyl groups can be univocally assigned to Ca&#8208;OH or Si&#8208;OH environments, and the local chemical environment largely affects the H&#8208;bond network of the solvation water. Interestingly, the ordered &#8220;ice&#8208;like&#8221; solvation water found in the Si&#8208;OH&#8208;rich environments is converted to a disordered &#8220;liquid&#8208;like&#8221; distribution in the Ca&#8208;OH&#8208;rich environment. This refined picture of the dynamics of confined water and hydroxyl groups in calcium silicate hydrates can also be applied to other water&#8208;containing materials, with a significant impact in many fields of materials science.</dc:description>

This refined picture of the dynamics of confined water and hydroxyl groups in calcium silicate hydrates can also be applied to other water-containing materials, with a significant impact in many fields of materials science.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hierarchical Architectures Based on Ru&#8208;Nanoparticles/Oxygen&#8208;Rich&#8208;CNT for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly active and durable electrocatalysts are essential for producing hydrogen fuel through hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we design the uniform deposition of Ru nanoparticles strongly interacting with oxygen&#8208;rich CNT architectures (Ru&#8208;OCNT) via ozonation and hydrothermal approaches. The hierarchical structure of Ru&#8208;OCNT is constructed by self&#8208;assembly of oxygen&#8208;functionalities of OCNT. Ru nanoparticles are strongly interacted with OCNT at Ru/OCNT interface for the excellent catalytic activity and stability of the Ru&#8208;OCNT, as further confirmed by density functional theory. Owing to the hierarchical structure and adjusted surface chemistry, Ru&#8208;OCNT has an overpotential of 34 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2  with a Tafel slope of 27.8 mV dec&#8208;1  in 1 M KOH, and an overpotential of 55 mV with Tafel slope of 33 mV dec&#8208;1  in 0.5 M H2SO4  . The smaller Tafel slope of Ru&#8208;OCNT than Ru&#8208;CNT and commercial Pt/C in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes indicates the high catalytic activity and fast charge transfer kinetics. The as&#8208;proposed chemistry provides the rational design of hierarchically structured CNT/nanoparticle electrocatalysts for HER to produce hydrogen fuel</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Oxazolomycins B and C</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report our efforts towards the first total synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;oxazolomycin B and (+)&#8208;oxazolomycin C from the intermediate of our previous synthesis of (+)&#8208;neoxazolomycin. The synthesis was achieved via a longest linear sequence of 25 steps from amino acid serine in 3.6% and 2.7% overall yield, respectively. The efficiency of our approach is derived from silyl triflate&#8208;mediated reductive oxazolidine ring&#8208;opening and F&#252;rstner&#8217;s Ru&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation and protodesilylation reactions. The obtained spectra and optical rotations were in good agreement with those of natural products, thus confirming the structures.</dc:description>

         <title>A Proton&#8208;Responsive Pyridyl(benzamide)&#8208;Functionalized NHC Ligand on Ir Complex for Alkylation of Ketones and Secondary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Cp*Ir(III) complex (  1  ) of a newly designed ligand L  1  featuring a proton&#8208;responsive pyridyl(benzamide) appended on N  &#8208;  heterocyclic carbene (NHC) has been synthesized. The molecular structure of  1  reveals a dearomatized form of the ligand. The protonation of  1  with HBF  4  in tetrahydrofuran gives the corresponding aromatized complex [Cp*Ir(L  1  H)Cl]BF  4  (  2  ). Both compounds are characterized spectroscopically and by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The protonation of  1  with acid is examined by  1  H NMR and UV&#8208;vis spectra. The proton&#8208;responsive character of  1  is exploited for catalyzing  &#945;  &#8208;alkylation of ketones and  &#946;  &#8208;alkylation of secondary alcohols using primary alcohols as alkylating agents through hydrogen&#8208;borrowing methodology. Compound  1  is an effective catalyst for these reactions and exhibits a superior activity in comparison to a structurally similar iridium complex [Cp*Ir(L  2  )Cl]PF  6  (  3  ) lacking a proton&#8208;responsive pendant amide moiety. The catalytic alkylation is characterized by a wide substrate scope, low catalyst and base loadings, and short reaction time. The catalytic efficacy of  1  is also demonstrated for the syntheses of quinoline and lactone derivatives via acceptorless dehydrogenation, and selective alkylation of two steroids, pregnenolone and testosterone. Detailed mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations substantiates the role of the proton&#8208;responsive ligand in the hydrogen&#8208;borrowing process.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination&#8208;induced N&#8211;H Bond Splitting of Ammonia and Primary Amine of CuI&#8211;MOFs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we reported a porous three&#8208;dimensional anionic tetrazolium based Cu  I  &#8211;MOF  1  , which is capable of cleaving N&#8211;H bond of ammonia and primary amine, as well as O&#8211;H bond of H  2  O along with the spontaneous H  2  evolution. In the gas&#8208;solid phase reaction of  1  with ammonia and water vapour, Cu  I  &#8211;MOF  1  was gradually oxidized to NH  2  &#8211;Cu  II  &#8211;MOF and OH&#8211;Cu  II  &#8211;MOF, respectively, through single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) structural transformations, which was confirmed by XPS, PXRD and X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal diffraction. Density functional theory (DFT) demonstrated that Cu  I  &#8211;MOF could lower N&#8208;H bond dissociation free energy of ammonia through coordination&#8208;induced bond weakening and promote H  2  evolution by the reduction potential of  1  . To our knowledge, this is the first example of MOFs which activated ammonia and amine in gas&#8208;solid manner.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) property is molecular by essence while commonly measured in solid crystalline state. Solvent crystallization molecules are usually neglected in the analysis and interpretation of solid state properties. Solvation/desolvation process in the polyoxometallate(POM)&#8211;based Na  9  [Er(W  5  O  18  )  2  ]&#183;35H  2  O SMM demonstrates that the dehydrated form relaxes more than 1000 times faster than the initial state while the rehydration process allows the quasi complete recovering of the initial magnetic behaviour. This dehydration process is monitored by Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and temperature dependent X&#8208;ray powder diffraction, and rationalized by periodic quantum chemical calculations evidencing the tremendous role of the labile water molecules in the stability of the edifice. Ab&#8208;initio calculations highlight that sodium ions localization in the structure drive the magnetic responses.

         <title>One&#8208;step Chemo&#8208;, Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Reduction of Ketosteroids to Hydroxysteroids over Zr&#8208;containing MOF&#8208;808 Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zr&#8208;containing MOF&#8208;808 is a very promising heterogeneous catalyst for the selective reduction of ketosteroids to the corresponding hydroxysteroids through a Meerwein&#8208;Ponndorf&#8208;Verley (MPV) reaction. Interestingly, the process leads to the diasteroselective synthesis of elusive 17&#945;&#8208;hydroxy derivatives in one step, while most chemical and biological transformations produce the 17&#946;&#8208;OH compounds, or they require several additional steps to convert 17&#946;&#8208;OH into 17&#945;&#8208;OH by inverting the configuration of the 17 center. Moreover, MOF&#8208;808 is found to be stable and reusable, and it is also chemoselective (only keto groups are reduced, even in the presence of other reducible groups such as C=C bonds) and regioselective (in 3,17&#8208;diketosteroids only the keto group in position 17 is reduced, while the 3&#8208;keto group remains almost intact). Kinetic rate constant and thermodynamic parameters of estrone reduction to estradiol have been obtained by a detailed temperature&#8208;dependent kinetic analysis. The results evidence a major contribution of the entropic term, thus suggesting that the diastereoselectivity of the process is controlled by the confinement of the reaction inside the MOF cavities, where the Zr  4+  active sites are located.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Nitrogen&#8208;doping in the Catalytic Transfer Hydrogenation of Phenol to Cyclohexanone with Formic Acid over Pd supported on Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly selective one&#8208;step hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone, an important intermediate in the production of nylon 6 and nylon 66, is desirable but remains a challenge. Pd nanoparticles supported on nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;functionalized carbon nanotubes (NCNTs, OCNTs) were prepared, characterized, and applied in the hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone to study the effect of N&#8208;doping. Almost full conversion of phenol with high selectivity to cyclohexanone was achieved over Pd/NCNT under mild reaction conditions using either H  2  or formic acid (FA) as a hydrogen source. The effects of reaction temperature and FA/phenol ratio and the reusability were investigated. Separate FA decomposition experiments without and with the addition of phenol were performed to investigate the reaction mechanism, especially the deactivation behavior. Deactivation was observed for both catalysts during the FA decomposition, while only Pd/OCNT rather than Pd/NCNT was deactivated in the transfer hydrogenation with FA and the FA decomposition in the presence of phenol, indicating the unique role of N&#8208;doping. Therefore, we assume that deactivation is caused by the strongly bound formates on the active Pd sites, suppressing further FA decomposition and/or transfer hydrogenation on Pd. The nonplanar adsorption of phenol on NCNTs via weak O&#8212;H&#8943;N interactions enables the occurrence of the subsequent hydrogenation by adsorbed formate on Pd.</dc:description>

         <title>Tune the Fluorescence and Electrochemiluminescence of Graphitic Carbon Nitride Nanosheets by Controlling the Defect States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The effects of defect states on the fluorescence (FL) and electrochemiluminescence (ECL) properties of graphite phase carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) are systematically investigated for the first time. The g&#8208;CN nanosheets (CNNSs) obtained at different condensation temperatures are used as the study models. It can be found that all the CNNSs have two kinds of defect states, one is originated from the edge of CNNSs (labeled as CN&#8208;defect) and the other is attributed to the partially carbonization regions (labeled as C&#8208;defect). Both the two kinds of defect states affect substantially the luminescent properties of CNNSs. Both the FL and ECL signals of CNNSs contain a band gap emission and two defect emissions. For the FL of CNNSs, decreasing the density of defect states can increase efficiently the FL quantum yield, while increasing the density of defect states can make the FL spectra red&#8208;shift. For the ECL of CNNSs, increasing the density of CN&#8208;defect states and decreasing the density of C&#8208;defect states are greatly important to improve the ECL activity. This work provides a deep insight into the FL and ECL mechanisms of g&#8208;CN, and is of significance in tuning the FL and ECL properties of g&#8208;CN. Also, it will greatly promote the applications of CNNSs based on the FL and ECL properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Round DNA Aptamer Selection by Combined Use of Capillary Electrophoresis and Next Generation Sequencing: An Aptaomics Approach for Identifying Unique Functional Protein&#8208;Binding DNA Aptamers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In DNA aptamer selection, existing methods do not discriminate aptamer sequences based on their binding affinity and function and the reproducibility of the selection is often poor, even for the selection of well&#8208;known aptamers like those that bind the commonly used model protein thrombin. In the present study, a novel single&#8208;round selection method (SR&#8208;CE selection) was developed by combining capillary electrophoresis (CE) with next generation sequencing. Using SR&#8208;CE selection, a successful semi&#8208;quantitative and semi&#8208;comprehensive aptamer selection for thrombin was demonstrated with high reproducibility for the first time. Selection rules based on dissociation equilibria and kinetics were devised to obtain families of analogous sequences. Selected sequences of the same family were shown to bind thrombin with high affinity. Furthermore, data acquired from SR&#8208;CE selection was mined by creating sub&#8208;libraries that were categorized by the functionality of the aptamers (e.g., pre&#8208;organized aptamers vs. structure&#8208;induced aptamers). Using this approach, a novel fluorescent molecular recognition sensor for thrombin with nanomolar detection limits was discovered. Thus, in this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept report, we have demonstrated the potential of a &#8220;DNA Aptaomics&#8221; approach to systematically design functional aptamers as well as to obtain high affinity aptamers.</dc:description>

         <title>What is The Catalytic Mechanism of Enzymatic Histone N&#8208;Methyl Arginine Demethylation and Can it be Influenced by an External Electric Field?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arginine methylation is an important mechanism of epigenetic regulation. Some Fe(II) and 2&#8208;oxoglutarate dependent Jumonji&#8208;C (JmjC) N&#949;&#8208;methyl lysine histone demethylases also have N&#8208;methyl arginine demethylase activity. We report combined molecular dynamic (MD) and Quantum Mechanical/Molecular Mechanical (QM/MM) studies on the mechanism of N&#8208;methyl arginine demethylation by human KDM4E and compare the results with those reported for N&#8208;methyl lysine demethylation by KDM4A. At the KDM4E active site, Glu191, Asn291, and Ser197 form a conserved scaffold that restricts substrate dynamics; substrate binding is also mediated by an out of active site hydrogen&#8208;bond between the substrate Ser1 and Tyr178.&#160;&#160;The calculations imply that in either C&#8208;H or N&#8208;H potential bond cleaving pathways for hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) during N&#8208;methyl arginine demethylation, electron transfer occurs via a &#963;&#8208;channel; the transition state for the N&#8208;H pathway is ~10 kcal/mol higher than for the C&#8208;H pathway due to the higher bond dissociation energy of the N&#8208;H bond. The results of applying external electric fields (EEFs) reveal EEFs with positive field strengths parallel to the Fe=O bond have a significant barrier&#8208;lowering effect on the C&#8208;H pathway, by contrast, such EEFs inhibit the N&#8208;H activation rate. The overall results imply that KDM4 catalyzed N&#8208;methyl arginine demethylation and N&#8208;methyl lysine demethylation occur via similar C&#8208;H abstraction and rebound mechanisms leading to methyl group hydroxylation, though there are differences in the interactions leading to productive binding of intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>CeCoOx core / Nb2O5@TiO2 Double Shell Nanocage Catalyst Demonstrates High Activity and Water Resistance for Catalytic Combustion of O&#8208;dichlorobenzene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we have successfully prepared a series of catalysts with different core&#8208;shell structures via hydrothermal method. They were consisted of CeCoOx@TiO2 (single shell), CeCoOx@Nb2O5 (single shell) and CeCoOx@Nb2O5@TiO2 (double shell) core&#8208;shell nanocages and CeCoOx nanocages, in which CeCoOx was core and TiO2 and Nb2O5 were shell. Then, the influence of core&#8208;shell structure on the catalytic performance of o&#8208;dichlorobenzene was investigated by activity, water&#8208;resistance, thermal stability test and catalyst characterization. The temperature corresponding to 90% conversion of o&#8208;dichlorobenzene (T90) of CeCoOx, CeCoOx@TiO2, CeCoOx@Nb2O5 and CeCoOx@Nb2O5@TiO2 catalysts was 415, 383, 362 and 367 &#176;C, respectively. CeCoOx@Nb2O5 exhibited the excellent catalytic activity, mainly owing to the special core&#8208;shell structure, large specific surface area, abundant activity species of Co3+, Ce3+, Nb5+, strong reducibility and more active oxygen vacancies. It can be seen that the Nb2O5 coating can greatly improve the catalytic activity of the catalyst. In addition, due to the protective effect of TiO2 shell on CeCoOx, CeCoOx@Nb2O5@TiO2 catalysts exhibited the outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability within 1200 minutes. The T90 of CeCoOx@Nb2O5@TiO2 was slightly lower than that of CeCoOx@Nb2O5, but it had higher stability and hydrothermal stability. Furthermore, the possible reaction pathway involving the Mars&#8208;van&#8208;Krevelen (MvK) and Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood (L&#8208;H) models were deduced.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this work, we have successfully prepared a series of catalysts with different core-shell structures via hydrothermal method.

         <title>Charge Transfer Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Containing the Red&#8208;Ox Active TTF/NDI Units for Highly Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), as a class of new inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid crystal materials, may have important application in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal conversion. Herein, we obtained a new charge transfer MOF ( Co&#8208;MOF ) with mixed ligands of H 4 TTFTB and bpmNDI incorporating red&#8208;ox active tetrathiafulvalene/naphthalene diimide (TTF/NDI) units into one system. Due to the presence of TTF/NDI oxidative and reductive couples, stable radicals can be observed in the MOF. Additionally, the charge transfer from the electron donor (TTF) to the acceptor (NDI) units results in a broad absorption in NIR region. Co&#8208;MOF exhibited the efficient photothermal effect induced by irradiating with NIR laser. Under the 808 nm laser (0.5 W cm &#8722;2 ) illumination, the temperature of Co&#8208;MOF promptly increases from room temperature to 151.7 &#176;C in only 10 s. Furthermore, a series of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films doped with trace amount of Co&#8208;MOF showed efficient NIR photothermal conversion. Irradiated by 808 nm laser with power of 0.5 W cm &#8722;2 , the temperature of Co&#8208;MOF@PDMS (0.6 wt%) film can reach a plateau at 62 &#176;C from 20 &#176;C within 100 s. Our experimental results from Co&#8208;MOF@PDMS film demonstrates that the effectiveness and feasibility of the material in promising photothermal applications.</dc:description>
