         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bridged Oligosilanylsilyl Mono&#8208; and Oligosilanylsilyl Dications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presence of multiple Si&#8722;H functionalities in one molecule is used to generate at low temperatures oligosilane&#8208;based mono&#8208; and dications that are stabilized by intramolecular 3c2e Si&#8722;H&#8722;Si bridges. For the oligosilanylsilyl monocation, a rapid intramolecular Si&#8722;H group exchange is monitored by NMR spectroscopy at low temperatures. This dynamic process is not observed for the corresponding dication. According to the obtained NMR data, both cationic Si&#8722;H&#8722;Si bridges are electronically isolated by the trisilanyl backbone.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bridged oligosilanylsilyl borates 8&#8201;[B(C6F5)4], 9[B(C6F5)4] and diborates 10&#8201;[B(C6F5)4]2 have been prepared by hydride transfer between &#945;&#8208;&#969;&#8208;dihydrido&#8208; (11) and branched tetrahydrido&#8208;oligosilanes (13) and trityl cation. The obtained cyclic intramolecularly stabilized silylium ions 8, 9 and bissilylium ion 10 were characterized by low temperature NMR spectroscopy supported by the results of density functional calculations. The branched Si&#8722;H&#8722;Si monocation 9 undergoes at low temperatures a fast degenerate rearrangement, which exchanges the Si&#8722;H groups with a barrier of 31&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 via an antarafacial transition state. Reaction of the branched monocation 9 with a second equivalent of trityl cation or of the branched oligosilane 13 with two equivalents of trityl cation, gives at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C the corresponding bissilylium ion 10, an example for a new class of highly reactive poly&#8208;Lewis acids.

         <title>Calixarenes Incorporating Sulfonamide Moieties: Versatile Ligands for Carbonic Anhydrases Inhibition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calixarene derivatives bearing arms terminating with primary benzensulfonamides demonstrated their ability of inhibiting human Carbonic Anhydrases with significant efficiency and selectivity among different isoforms of the enzymes. A mode of binding where the benzensulfonamide arm penetrates into the funnel of the enzyme active site and interacts with the protein Zn2+ ion is supported by X&#8208;ray diffraction data and MD calculations.







Abstract
Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) continue to represent a relevant pharmaceutical target. The need of selective inhibitors and the involvement of these metalloenzymes in many multifaceted diseases boost the search for new ligands able to distinguish among the different CA isoforms, and for multifunctional systems simultaneously able to inhibit CAs and to interfere with other pathological events by interacting with additional targets. In this work, we successfully explored the possibility of preparing new CAs ligands by combining calixarenes with benzensulfonamide units. Inhibition tests towards three human CA isoforms evidenced, for some of the ligands, Ki values in the nanomolar range and promising selectivity. X&#8208;ray and molecular modeling studies provided information on the mode of binding of these calixarene derivatives. Thanks to the encouraging results and the structural features typical of the calixarene scaffold, it is then possible to plan for the future the design of multifunctional inhibitors for this class of widely spread enzymes.

         <title>BOPHY&#8208;Fullerene C60 Dyad as a Photosensitizer for Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photosensitizer: The first BOPHY&#8211;fullerene C60 dyad (BP&#8208;C60) has been synthesized and obtained as two atropisomers. The presence of the BOPHY light&#8208;harvesting antenna in the dyad increases the absorption of the fullerene moiety in the visible region and improves its photodynamic action. Photoinduced energy/electron transfer processes (EnT/PeT) take place from BOPHY to fullerene C60. The dyad exhibits an efficient production of reactive oxygen species. BP&#8208;C60 is a promising heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizer with potential application in photodynamic treatments..







Abstract
A novel BOPHY&#8211;fullerene C60 dyad (BP&#8208;C60) was designed as a heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizer (PS) with potential uses in photodynamic treatment and reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated applications. BP&#8208;C60 consists of a BOPHY fluorophore covalently attached to a C60 moiety through a pyrrolidine ring. The BOPHY core works as a visible&#8208;light&#8208;harvesting antenna, while the fullerene C60 subunit elicits the photodynamic action. This fluorophore&#8211;fullerene cycloadduct, obtained by a straightforward synthetic route, was fully characterized and compared with its individual counterparts. The restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the BOPHY and pyrrolidine moieties led to the formation of two atropisomers. Spectroscopic, electrochemical, and computational studies disclose an efficient photoinduced energy/electron transfer process from BOPHY to fullerene C60. Photodynamic studies indicate that BP&#8208;C60 produces ROS by both photomechanisms (type&#8197;I and type&#8197;II). Moreover, the dyad exhibits higher ROS production efficiency than its individual constitutional components. Preliminary screening of photodynamic inactivation on bacteria models (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) demonstrated the ability of this dyad to be used as a heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free PS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that not only a BOPHY&#8211;fullerene C60 dyad is reported, but also that a BOPHY derivative is applied to photoinactivate microorganisms. This study lays the foundations for the development of new BOPHY&#8208;based PSs with plausible applications in the medical field.

The bonding character, electron delocalization, and aromaticity of C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) were studied by advanced theoretical means. The difference of electron delocalization between two sets of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems and significant influence of the number of &#8208;CO groups on them were focused on, and the essential reason for the distinct difference in molecular aromaticity was elucidated.







Abstract
The bonding character, electron delocalization, and aromaticity of the cyclo[18]carbon (C18) precursors, C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2), have been studied by combining quantum chemical calculations and various electronic wavefunction analyses with different physical bases. It was found that C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) molecules exhibit alternating long and short C&#8722;C bonds, and have out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane dual &#960; systems (&#960;out and &#960;in) perpendicular to each other, which are consistent with the relevant characteristics of C18. However, the presence of carbonyl (&#8208;CO) groups significantly reduced the global electron conjugation of C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) compared to C18. Specifically, the &#8208;CO group largely breaks the extensive delocalization of &#960;in system, and the &#960;out system is also affected by it but to a much lesser extent; as a consequence, C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) with larger n shows weaker overall aromaticity. Mostly because of the decreased but still apparent &#960;out electron delocalization in the C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2), a notable diatropic induced ring current under the action of external magnetic field is observed, demonstrating the clear aromatic characteristic in the molecules. The correlation between C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) and C18 in terms of the gradual elimination of &#8208;CO from the precursors showed that the direct elimination of two CO molecules in C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) has a synergistic mechanism, but it is kinetically infeasible under normal conditions due to the high energy barrier.

Label&#8208;free electrochemiluminescence imaging of single cells has been achieved through a bipolar nanoelectrode array. The picture is divided into two parts by a strip of film, indicating that the bipolar nanoelectrode array separates cells and imaging. Oxygen is shown as the electrochemical probe and Ru(bpy)32+ as the luminescence molecule. More information can be found in the Research Article by X.&#8208;H. Xia et&#8197;al.

         <dc:description>We have developed the first enantioselective reductive aldol reaction of unprotected &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids by employing a copper/bisphosphine catalyst. The reaction features in situ protection and activation of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acid by a hydrosilane. The copper enolate formed in situ reacts with a ketone to afford the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy carboxylic acid with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99% ee). The corresponding gram&#8208;scale reaction with a low catalyst loading and the derivatization of the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy carboxylic acids highlight the practicality of this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Aldehydes with Allylboronates Enables Facile Access to Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present herein a novel strategy for the preparation of ketones from aldehydes and allylic boronicesters. This reaction involves the allylation of aldehydes with allylic boronicesters and the Rh&#8208;catalyzed chain&#8208;walking of homoallylic alcohols. The key to this successful development is the protodeboronation of alkenyl borylether intermediate via a tetravalent borate anion species in the presence of KHF  2  and MeOH. This approach features mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies also supported that the tandem allylation and chain&#8208;walking process was involved.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrostatic perturbations in the substrate&#8208;binding pocket of taurine/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate dioxygenase determine its selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Taurine/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate dioxygenase is an important enzyme that takes part in the cysteine catabolism process in the human body and selectively hydroxylates taurine at the C  1  &#8208;position. Recent computational studies showed that in the gas&#8208;phase the C  2  &#8722;H bond of taurine is substantially weaker than the C  1  &#8722;H bond, yet no evidence exists of 2&#8208;hydroxytaurine products. To this end, we performed a detailed computational study on the selectivity patterns in TauD. The calculations show that the second&#8208;coordination sphere and the protonation states of residues play a major role in guiding the enzyme to the right selectivity. Specifically, a single proton on an active site histidine residue can change the regioselectivity of the reaction through its electrostatic perturbations in the active site and effectively changes the C  1  &#8722;H and C  2  &#8722;H bond strengths of taurine. This is further emphasized by many polar and hydrogen bonding interactions of the protein cage in TauD with the substrate and the oxidant that weaken the  pro  &#8208;  R  C  1  &#8722;H bond and triggers a chemoselective reaction process. Our large cluster models reproduce the experimental free energy of activation excellently.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and crystallographic characterization of a phosphinine&#8208;borane adduct was achieved for the first time by using a Me3Si&#8208;functionalized phosphinine and the Lewis acid B(C6F5)3. This reaction strongly depends on the nature of the substituents in the &#945;&#8208;position of the phosphorus heterocycle. In contrast, the reaction of B2H6 with various substituted phosphinines leads to an equilibrium between the starting materials and the phosphinine&#8208;borane adducts, which is determined by the Lewis&#8208;basicity of the phosphinine. The novel phosphinine borane adduct (6&#8208;B(C6F5)3) shows rapid and facile insertion and [4+2] cycloaddition reactivity towards phenylacetylene. With styrene a hitherto unknown dihydro&#8208;1&#8208;phosphabarrelene is formed. The reaction with an ester provides a new, facile and selective route to 1&#8208;R&#8208;phosphininium salts. These salts then undergo a [4+2] cycloaddition in the presence of Me3Si&#8208;C&#8801;CH and styrene, respectively, to cleanly form unprecedented derivatives of 1&#8208;R&#8208;phosphabarrelenium salts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The targeted search for suitable solid&#8208;state ionic conductors requires a certain understanding of the conduction mechanism and the correlation of the structures and the resulting properties of the material.

         <title>Rhodium&#8211;Iodide Complex on a Catalytically Active SiO2 Surface for One&#8208;Pot Hydrosilylation&#8211;CO2 Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface Rh&#8211;iodide complex for one&#8208;pot catalysis: A one&#8208;pot synthetic strategy for the hydrosilylation of olefin is developed. The hydrosilylation reaction is accelerated in the presence of a novel Rh&#8211;iodide complex developed on the surface of SiO2. The decrease in steric hindrance and electron donation from iodide to Rh promote the catalytic process.







Abstract
In this study, a novel Rh&#8211;iodide complex was synthesized through a surface reaction between an immobilized Rh cyclooctadiene complex and alkylammonium iodide (N+I&#8722;) on SiO2. In the presence of ammonium cations, the SiO2&#8208;supported Rh&#8211;iodide complex could be effectively used for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of various silylcarbonate derivatives starting from epoxy olefins, hydrosilanes, and CO2. The maximum turnover numbers (TONs) for the hydrosilylation reaction and the CO2 cycloaddition were 7600 (Rh) and 130 (N+I&#8722;), respectively. The catalyst exhibited much higher performance for hydrosilylation than solely the Rh complex on SiO2. The mechanism of the Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation reaction and the local structure of Rh, which is affected by the co&#8208;immobilized N+I&#8722;, were investigated by using Rh and I K&#8208;edge XAFS and XPS. Analysis of the XAFS profiles indicated the presence of a Rh&#8722;I bond. The Rh unit was in its electron&#8208;rich state. Curve&#8208;fitting analysis of the Rh K&#8208;edge EXAFS profiles suggests dissociation of the cycloocta&#8208;1,5&#8208;diene (COD) ligand from the Rh center. Results from spectroscopic and kinetic analyses revealed that the high activity of the catalyst (during hydrosilylation) could be attributed to a decrease in steric hindrance and the electron&#8208;rich state of the Rh. The decrease in the steric hindrance could be attributed to the absence of COD, and the electron&#8208;rich state promoted the oxidative addition of Si&#8722;H. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a one&#8208;pot silylcarbonate synthesis as well as a determination of a novel surface Rh&#8211;iodide complex and its catalysis.

         <title>Z&#8208;Scheme In2S3/NU&#8208;1000 Heterojunction for Boosting Photo&#8208;Oxidation of Sulfide into Sulfoxide under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of In2S3/NU&#8208;1000&#8201;heterojunction photocatalysts was constructed via a solvothermal method, which efficiently catalyzes the oxidation of sulfides to form sulfoxides as the sole product under LED lamp (full&#8208;spectrum) illumination in air at room temperature. Especially, the sulfur mustard simulant, 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), can also be photocatalytically oxidized with In2S3/NU&#8208;1000 to afford nontoxic 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide (CEESO) selectively and effectively.







Abstract
Photocatalytic oxidation of sulfide into sulfoxide has attracted extensive attention as an environmentally friendly strategy for chemical transformations or toxic chemicals degradation. Herein, we construct a series of In2S3/NU&#8208;1000 heterojunction photocatalysts, which can efficiently catalyze the oxidation of sulfides to form sulfoxides as the sole product under LED lamp (full&#8208;spectrum) illumination in air at room temperature. Especially, the sulfur mustard simulant, 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), can also be photocatalytically oxidized with In2S3/NU&#8208;1000 to afford nontoxic 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide (CEESO) selectively and effectively. In contrast, individual NU&#8208;1000 and In2S3 show very low catalytic activity on this reaction. The significantly improved photocatalytic activity is ascribed to the constructing of an efficient Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysts In2S3/NU&#8208;1000, which exhibits the enhancement of light harvesting, the promotion of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole separation, and the retention of high porosity of the parent MOF. Moreover, mechanism studies in photocatalytic oxidation reveal that the superoxide radical (.O2&#8722;) and singlet oxygen (1O2) are the main oxidative species in the oxidation system. This work exploits the opportunities for the construction of porous Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysts based on the photoactive MOFs materials and inorganic semiconductors for promoting catalytic organic transformations. More importantly, it provides a route to the rational design of efficient photocatalysts for the detoxification of mustard gas.

         <title>Characterization of Cyclic N&#8208;Acyliminium Ions by Infrared Ion Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Acyliminium ions (NAIs) are highly reactive intermediates that are important for the construction of CC&#8208;bonds adjacent to nitrogen atoms. These species have been characterized for the first time in the gas phase by collision induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry followed by infrared ion spectroscopy (IRIS), which has led to new structural information that can be invoked to explain the diastereoselectivity of reactions involving these cationic intermediates.







Abstract
N&#8208;Acyliminium ions are highly reactive intermediates that are important for creating CC&#8208;bonds adjacent to nitrogen atoms. Here we report the characterization of cyclic N&#8208;acyliminium ions in the gas phase, generated by collision induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry followed by infrared ion spectroscopy using the FELIX infrared free electron laser. Comparison of DFT calculated spectra with the experimentally observed IR spectra provided valuable insights in the conformations of the N&#8208;acyliminium ions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;N-&lt;/i&gt;Acyliminium ions are highly reactive intermediates that are important for creating CC-bonds adjacent to nitrogen atoms. Here we report the characterization of cyclic &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acyliminium ions in the gas phase, generated by collision induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry followed by infrared ion spectroscopy using the FELIX infrared free electron laser. Comparison of DFT calculated spectra with the experimentally observed IR spectra provided valuable insights in the conformations of the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acyliminium ions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bulk Mn2+ Doped 1D Hybrid Lead Halide Perovskite with Highly Efficient, Tunable and Stable Broadband Light Emissions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimization of 1D perovskite: Through controllable Mn2+ doping strategy toward bulk 1D perovskite, enhanced energy transfer from bound excitons of host material to 3d electrons of Mn2+ ions gives rise to tunable broadband light emissions from weak yellow to strong red spectral range with highest PLQY up to 28.41&#8201;%. More importantly, these Mn2+&#8208;doped 1D perovskites display ultrahigh structural and optical stabilities in humid atmosphere, water and high temperature exceeding the conventional 3D perovskite nanocrystals.







Abstract
Mn2+ doped colloidal three&#8208;dimensional (3D) lead halide perovskite nanocrystal (PNC) has attracted intensive research attention; however, the low exciton binding energy and fatal optical instability of 3D PNC seriously hinder the optoelectronic application. Therefore, it remains significant to explore new stable host perovskite with strongly bound exciton to realize more desirable luminescent property. In this work, we utilized bulk one&#8208;dimensional (1D) hybrid perovskite of [AEP]PbBr5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O (AEP=N&#8208;aminoethylpiperazine) as structural platform to rationally optimize the luminescent property by a controllable Mn2+ doping strategy. Significantly, the series of Mn2+&#8208;doped 1D [AEP]PbBr5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O show enhanced energy transfer efficiency from the strongly bound excitons of host material to 3d electrons of Mn2+ ions, resulting in tunable broadband light emissions from weak yellow to strong red spectral range with highest photoluminescence quantum yield up to 28.41&#8201;%. More importantly, these Mn2+&#8208;doped 1D perovskites display ultrahigh structural and optical stabilities in humid atmosphere, water and high temperature exceeding the conventional 3D PNC. Combined highly efficient, tunable and stable broadband light emissions enable Mn2+&#8208;doped 1D perovskite as excellent down&#8208;converting phosphor showcasing the potential application in white light emitting diode. This work not only provides a profound understanding of low&#8208;dimensional perovskites but also opens a new way to rationally design high&#8208;performance broadband light emitting perovskites for solid&#8208;state lighting and displaying devices.

         <title>Prebiotically Plausible Autocatalytic Peptide Amyloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple amino acids activated by the volcanic gas carbonyl sulfide can condense into peptides that then spontaneously assemble into amyloids. This suggests a plausible prebiotic relevance of peptide amyloids and has led to the discovery that they can template sequence&#8208;selective, regioselective and stereoselective peptide synthesis. Depending on the environmental conditions, such amyloid templating can function in either complementary or self&#8208;replicating mode. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Riek, J. Greenwald, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103841).

         <title>Anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Inhibitory Profile of New Quinoline Compounds in Cell Culture&#8208;Based Infection Models</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New quinoline&#8208;based compounds were synthesized via conventional synthetic methods, including copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition reactions (CuAAC) and were studied for their activity against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. These quinoline derivatives showed pronounced cell culture&#8208;based inhibitory profiles against the virus (EC50 down to 1.5&#177;1.0&#8197;&#956;M), thus presenting a very promising developmental basis compared to reference drugs chloroquine (EC50=3.1&#177;2.7&#8197;&#956;M).







Abstract
The presently ongoing pandemic of human SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infections (COVID&#8208;19) presents an enormous challenge in surveillance, vaccine and antiviral drug development. Here we report the synthesis of new bioactive quinoline&#8208;morpholine hybrid compounds and their virological evaluation, which proves pronounced cell culture&#8208;based inhibitory profile against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Thus, selected quinoline compounds may suggest specific hit&#8208;to&#8208;lead development.

A new bi&#8208;functional ligand bearing chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and prolinol moieties is designed and applied in the generation of a Cu/Zn hetero&#8208;bimetallic complex, which unlocks the asymmetric allylic alkylation reactions of allyl phosphates with zinc keto&#8208;homoenolates generated from cyclopropanols, leading to the formation of various &#947;&#8208;vinyl ketones with good regio&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selectivity. DFT calculation supports that the chelation of allyl phosphates with catalyst promotes the SN2&#8217; addition and the ligand&#8208;substrate steric interactions account for the stereoselective outcome.

         <title>Highly Regioselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Transfer Hydrodeuteration of Unactivated Terminal Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precision deuteration of unactivated alkenes: A copper&#8208;catalyzed alkene transfer hydrodeuteration for the synthesis of precisely deuterated small molecules is described. It is the most regio&#8208; and chemoselective transfer hydrodeuteration of unactivated terminal alkenes reported to date. The transformation was performed across a broad scope of substrates and even demonstrated on two natural product derivatives.







Abstract
Catalytic transfer hydrodeuteration of unactivated alkenes is challenging because of the requirement that chemically similar hydrogen and deuterium undergo selective insertion across a &#960;&#8208;bond. We now report a highly regioselective catalytic transfer hydrodeuteration of unactivated terminal alkenes across a variety of heteroatom&#8208; or heterocycle&#8208;containing substrates. The base&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reaction is also demonstrated on two complex natural products. Reaction studies indicate modular conditions that can also be extended to perform either an alkene transfer hydrogenation or transfer deuteration.

The transformation was performed across a broad scope of substrates and even demonstrated on two natural product derivatives.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalytic transfer hydrodeuteration of unactivated alkenes is challenging because of the requirement that chemically similar hydrogen and deuterium undergo selective insertion across a &#960;-bond. We now report a highly regioselective catalytic transfer hydrodeuteration of unactivated terminal alkenes across a variety of heteroatom- or heterocycle-containing substrates. The base-metal-catalyzed reaction is also demonstrated on two complex natural products. Reaction studies indicate modular conditions that can also be extended to perform either an alkene transfer hydrogenation or transfer deuteration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The Groebke&#8211;Blackburn&#8211;Bienaym&#233; three&#8208;component reaction (GBB&#8208;3CR) has contributed enormously to the progress of organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry, and materials science. Diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of skeletally diverse cyclophanyl&#8208;derived fused imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]heterocycles by one&#8208;pot GBB&#8208;3CR involving formyl&#8208;cyclophane components in combination with various aliphatic and aromatic isocyanides and heteroaromatic amidines gives a library of versatile cyclophanyl imidazoles ligands. These can be readily transformed to prepare N,C palladacycles by regioselective ortho&#8208;palladation. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Br&#228;se et&#8197;al.

         <title>A solid support&#8208;based synthetic strategy for the site&#8208;selective functionalization of peptides with organometallic half&#8208;sandwich moieties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The number of donor atoms available on peptides that can competitively coordinate to metal centers renders the site&#8208;selective generation of advanced metal&#8211;peptide conjugates in high purity a challenging venture. Herein, we present a transmetalation&#8208;based synthetic approach on solid support in which an imidazolium proligand can be used to selectively anchor a range of transition metal half&#8208;sandwich complexes onto peptides in the presence of multiple coordinative motifs. Amenable to solid support, a range of N&#8208;terminus and/or lysine conjugated metal&#8208;peptide conjugates were obtained in high purity after cleavage from the resin. The metalated peptides were evaluated for their anticancer properties against human cancer cell lines. While no cytotoxic activity was observed, this platform has the potential to i) provide a pathway to site&#8208;selective peptide labelling, ii) be explored as a biorthogonal handle and/or iii) generate a new strategy for ligand design in transition metal catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>211At and 125I&#8208;labeling of (hetero)aryliodonium ylides: astatine wins again</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the growing interest in radioiodine and  211  At&#8208;labeled radiopharmaceuticals, the search for radiolabeling reactions has been somewhat neglected, resulting in a limited number of available radiosynthetic strategies. Herein we report a comparative study of nucleophilic  125  I and  211  At&#8208;labeling of aryliodonium ylides. Whereas radioiodination efficiency was low,  211  At&#8208;labeling performed efficiently on a broad scope of precursors. The most activated aryliodonium ylides led rapidly to quantitative reactions at room temperature in acetonitrile. For deactivated precursors, heating up to 90&#176;C in glyme and addition of 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) as radical scavenger appeared essential to avoid precursor degradation and to achieve high radiochemical yields and molar activity. The approach was applied successfully to the preparation of 4&#8208;[  211  At]astatophenylalanine (4&#8208;APA), an amino acid derivative increasingly studied as radiotherapeutic drug for cancers. This validated aryliodonium ylides as a valuable tool for nucleophilic  211  At&#8208;labeling and will complement the short but now growing list of available astatination reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Switches and Motors: Recent Developments and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by human vision, a diverse range of light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors has been developed for fundamental understanding and application in material science and biology. Recently, the design and synthesis of visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors have been actively pursued. This emerging trend is partly motivated to avoid the harmful effects of ultraviolet light, which was necessary to drive the classical molecular switches and motors at least in one direction, impeding their employment in biomedical and photopharmacology applications. Moreover, visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors are demonstrated to enable benign optical materials for advanced photonic devices. Therefore, during the past several years, visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches based on azobenzene derivatives, diarylethenes, 1,2&#8208;dicyanodithienylethenes, hemithioindigo derivatives, iminothioindoxyls, donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adducts, and overcrowded alkene based molecular motors have been judiciously designed, synthesized, and used in the development of functional materials and systems for a wide range of applications. In this Review, we present the recent developments toward the design of visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors, with their applications in the fabrication of functional materials and systems in material science, bioscience, pharmacology,  etc  . The visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors realized so far undoubtedly widen the scope of these interesting compounds for technological and biological applications. We hope this Review article could provide additional impetus and inspire further research interests for future exploration of visible light&#8208;driven advanced materials, systems, and devices.</dc:description>

         <title>A masked form of an O&#8208;borylated Breslow intermediate for the diastereoselective FLP&#8208;type activation of aldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Breslow intermediates are very often elusive species whose application in Frustrated Lewis Pair chemistry is unprecedented. We describe herein the use of a masked form of an O&#8208;Borylated Breslow (OBB) intermediate that performs FLP&#8208;type activation of the carbonyl function of five different benzaldehyde derivatives with complete diastereoselectivity. The resulting compounds are characterised in solution by NMR spectroscopy (compounds  4  &#8208;  8  ) and in solid state by X&#8208;Ray diffraction analysis (compounds  4  &#8208;  6  ). A combined kinetic and theoretical investigation reveals the associative nature of the rate determining step and suggests that the OBB intermediate part is never released during the whole process.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel lipophilic fluorophores with highly acidity&#8208;dependent two&#8208;photon response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipophilic fluorophores are widely implemented in nonlinear microscopy; however, few existing membrane&#8208;specific probes combine high brightness of two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence (2PEF) with pH sensitivity. Here we describe four novel two&#8208;photon excited fluorophores, based on a coumarin 151 core structure, where lipophilicity is induced by a covalently attached phosphazene moiety. Changing the environmental acidity using trifluoromethanesulfonic (triflic) acid leads to profound changes in the linear fluorescence and 2PEF characteristics, due to chromophores&#8217; switching between neutral&#8208; and protonated forms. We characterize this dependence by measuring the two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) spectra over the region  &#955;  2PA  = 550 &#8211; 1000 nm, observing 2PA cross sections of  &#963;  2PA  = 10 &#8211; 20 GM, with associated 2PEF brightness of 10 &#8211; 13 GM, in neutral solutions of both acetonitrile and  n  &#8208;octanol. Although quantum chemical modelling and NMR measurements show that, at high chromophore concentrations, protonation may be accompanied by a dimerization process, these dimers likely do not form at the lower concentrations used in optical spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>A Redox&#8208;active Microporous Organosiloxane Containing a Stable Neutral Radical, Trioxotriangulene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new silyl&#8208;substituted trioxotriangulene (  TOT  ) neutral radical and corresponding porous organosiloxanes (POSs) were synthesized. The neutral radical exhibited a peculiarly high stability and formed a diamagnetic &#960;&#8208;dimer characteristic to  TOT  neutral radicals stabilized by the strong multiple SOMO&#8208;SOMO interaction in both solution and solid states. POSs including  TOT  units within the organosiloxane&#8208;wall were prepared by polycondensation of the silyl groups, and formed microporous structures with ~1 nm&#8208;size diameters. Redox ability of  TOT  units in the POS was demonstrated by the treatment of oxidant/reductant in heterogeneous suspension condition, where the  TOT  units were reversibly converted between reduced and neutral radical species. Furthermore, the solid&#8208;state electrochemical measurements of the POS revealed the reversible multi&#8208;stage redox ability of  TOT  units involving polyanionic species within the organosiloxane&#8208;wall.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyanide&#8208;Free Cyanation of sp2 and sp&#8208;Carbons by Oxazole based Masked CN Source Using Flow Microreactors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report a cyanide&#8208;free continuous&#8208;flow process for cyanation of sp  2  and sp carbons to synthesize aryl, vinyl and acetylenic nitriles from (5&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenyloxazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl) boronic acid [OxBA] reagent as a sole source of carbon&#8208;bound masked &#8208;CN source. Non&#8208;toxic and stable OxBA reagent is generated by lithiation&#8208;borylation of bromo&#8208;oxazole, and the consecutive Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling with aryl, vinyl, or acetylenic halides and demasking [4 + 2]/retro&#8208;[4 + 2] sequence were successfully accomplished to give the desired cyano compounds with reasonably good yields in a four&#8208;step flow manner. A unique feature of this cyanation protocol in flow enables to cyanate a variety of sp  2  and sp carbons to produce a broad spectrum of aryl acetonitrile. It is envisaged that the OxBA based cyanation would replace existing unstable and toxic approaches as well as non&#8208;toxic cyanation using two different sources of &#8220;C&#8221; and &#8220;N&#8221; to incorporate the &#8208;CN group.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first chiral multi&#8208;layer 3D folding polymers have been assembled and regulated by both uniformed and differentiated aromatic chromophoric units between naphthyl piers. Screening catalysts, catalytic systems and monomers was proven to be crucial for asymmetric catalytic Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura poly&#8208;couplings for this assembly. X&#8208;ray crystallography of corresponding dimers and trimers revealed the absolute stereochemistry and the intermolecular packing pattern. Up to 61,960 M w /41,900 M n and m / z = 4317 for polymers and oligomers as confirmed by GPC and MALDI&#8208;TOF MS indicated that the present frameworks were composed of multiple layers stacked. The resulting multiple &#960;&#8208;assemblies exhibited remarkable optical properties in aggregated states (PL in solids and AIE in solutions), as well as reversible redox properties in electrochemical performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrazone Photoswitches for Structural Modulation of Short Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecules that undergo light&#8208;driven structural transformations constitute the core components in photoswitchable molecular systems and materials. Among various families of photoswitches, photochromic hydrazones have recently emerged as a novel class of photoswitches with superb properties, such as high photochemical conversion, spectral tunability, thermal stability, and fatigue resistance. Hydrazone photoswitches have been adopted in various adaptive materials at different length scales, however, their utilization for modulating biomolecules still has not been explored. Herein we present new hydrazone switches that can photomodulate the structures of short peptides. Systematic investigation on a set of hydrazone derivatives revealed that installation of the amide group does not significantly alter the photoswitching behaviors. Importantly, a hydrazone switch comprising an upper phenyl ring and a lower quinolinyl ring was effective for structural control of peptides. We anticipate that this work, as a new milestone in the research of hydrazone switches, will open a new avenue for structural and functional control of biomolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis, Configurational Assignment and Biological Evaluations of the Lipid Mediator RvD2n&#8208;3 DPA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RvD2n&#8208;3 DPA, a specialized pro&#8208;resolving mediator, is synthesized for the first time based on the retrosynthetic outline depicted, enabling its structural elucidation and biological evaluations against S. aureus and zymosan A induced inflammation.







Abstract
Herein we report the first total synthesis of RvD2n&#8208;3 DPA, an endogenously formed mediator biosynthesized from the omega&#8208;3 fatty acid n&#8208;3 docosapentaenoic acid. The key steps are the Midland Alpine borane reduction, Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reactions, and a Z&#8208;selective alkyne reduction protocol, yielding RvD2n&#8208;3 DPA methyl ester in 13&#8201;% yield over 12 steps (longest linear sequence). The physical property data (UV chromophore, chromatography and MS/MS fragmentation) of the synthetic lipid mediator matched those obtained from biologically produced material. Moreover, synthetic RvD2n&#8208;3 DPA also carried the potent biological activities of enhancing macrophage uptake of Staphylococcus aureus and zymosan A bioparticles.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Similarities across species: MS&#8208;guided isolation and the first total synthesis of bacterial sulfonosphingolipids allowed bioactivity studies on their rosette&#8208;inducing and inhibiting capabilities in Salpingoeca rosetta. The most abundant sulfonosphingolipids inhibited rosette inducing factor&#8208;related activity in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner thus suggesting that sulfobacins are likely competing for the same cellular target in S. rosetta.







Abstract
We have analyzed the abundance of bacterial sulfonosphingolipids, including rosette&#8208;inducing factors (RIFs), in seven bacterial prey strains by using high&#8208;resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HRMS2) and molecular networking (MN) within the Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) web platform. Six sulfonosphingolipids resembling RIFs were isolated and their structures were elucidated based on comparative MS and NMR studies. Here, we also report the first total synthesis of two RIF&#8208;2 diastereomers and one congener in 15 and eight synthetic steps, respectively. For the total synthesis of RIF&#8208;2 congeners, we employed a decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reaction to synthesize the necessary branched &#945;&#8208;hydroxy fatty acids, and the Garner&#8208;aldehyde approach to generate the capnine base carrying three stereogenic centers. Bioactivity studies in the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta revealed that the rosette inducing activity of RIFs is inhibited dose dependently by the co&#8208;occurring sulfonosphingolipid sulfobacins D and F and that activity of RIFs is specific for isolates obtained from Algoriphagus.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State NMR&#8208;Driven Crystal Structure Prediction of Molecular Crystals: The Case of Mebendazole</title>

Make it faster! A combined Crystal Structure Prediction &#8211; NMR crystallography (CSP&#8197;NMRX) approach is presented for solving the structures of the three polymorphs, A, B, and C, of mebendazole. These are characterized by three different tautomeric forms, that is, they are desmotropes. The predicted structures show perfect overlapping with the experimental ones, with that of form B solved de novo from powder X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
Among all possible NMR crystallography approaches for crystal&#8208;structure determination, crystal structure prediction &#8211; NMR crystallography (CSP&#8208;NMRX) has recently turned out to be a powerful method. In the latter, the original procedure exploited solid&#8208;state NMR (SSNMR) information during the final steps of the prediction. In particular, it used the comparison of computed and experimental chemical shifts for the selection of the correct crystal packing. Still, the prediction procedure, generally carried out with DFT methods, may require important computational resources and be quite time&#8208;consuming, especially if there are no available constraints to use at the initial stage. Herein, the successful application of this combined prediction method, which exploits NMR information also in the input step to reduce the search space of the predictive algorithm, is presented. Herein, this method was applied on mebendazole, which is characterized by desmotropism. The use of SSNMR data as constraints for the selection of the right tautomer and the determination of the number of independent molecules in the unit cell led to a considerably faster process, reducing the number of calculations to be performed. In this way, the crystal packing was successfully predicted for the three known phases of mebendazole. To evaluate the quality of the predicted structures, these were compared to the experimental ones. The crystal structure of phase&#8197;B of mebendazole, in particular, was determined de novo by powder diffraction and is presented for the first time in this paper.

Selective photoreaction under shielded conditions. We have developed near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;activatable phthalocyanine catalysts. In this image, the colors of the cars show the kind of light. The visible wavelengths (rainbow colors) are blocked (traffic cones); only NIR light (the gray vehicle) can pass to interact with the phthalocyanine catalyst. After this photoreaction, singlet oxygen (as 1O2) and product are generated. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T. Furuyama, H. Nakai, et&#8197;al.

         <title>An Alkynyl&#8208;Dangling Ru(II) Polypyridine Complex for Targeted Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alkynyl&#8208;dangling ruthenium(II) polypyridine complex Ru2, which may rapidly conjugate to the amino groups on the unique membrane lipids of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria through the bio&#8208;orthogonal amino&#8208;yne click reaction has been investigated. Such a selective labeling process in combination with its good singlet oxygen quantum yield makes Ru2 to be able to photo&#8208;inactivate bacterial such as S. aureus and MRSA efficiently and specifically, but leaving mammalian cells undamaged under the same conditions.







Abstract
To realize clinical application of antibacterial photodynamic therapy (aPDT), one of the most arduous challenges is how to render aPDT agents high selectivity against bacterial pathogens. In light of the fact that amino group&#8208;containing lipids are rich on the outer surfaces of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, we herein constructed an alkynyl&#8208;dangling ruthenium(II) polypyridine complex (Ru2) to preferentially label Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) over mammalian cells via the amino&#8208;yne bio&#8208;orthogonal click reaction. Thanks to the strong singlet oxygen generation ability, Ru2 could photo&#8208;inactivate S. aureus and MRSA effectively and specifically. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) molecules also exist in mammalian cells but are not accessible for Ru2, leading to its poor binding/uptake and negligible cytotoxicity in the dark and upon irradiation towards mammalian cells as well as low hemolysis, all favorable for aPDT application.

         <title>Promoter&#8208;Driven Overexpression in Chromobacterium vaccinii Facilitates Access to FR900359 and Yields Novel Low Abundance Analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The promoter&#8208;driven overexpression of the frs biosynthetic gene cluster, encoding the nonribosomal peptide assembly line for FR900359, in Chromobacterium vaccinii resulted in up to 8&#8208;fold increase in production compared to the wild type. Thereby, the challenging access to FR could be significantly enhanced and novel low abundance analogs of FR were made accessible for characterization of their structures and concerning their growth inhibition of uveal melanoma cell lines.







Abstract
Access to the cyclic depsipeptide FR900359 (FR), a selective Gq/11 protein inhibitor of high pharmacological interest and a potential lead molecule for targeted therapy of cancers with oncogenic GNAQ or GNA11 mutations (encoding Gq and G11 respectively), has been challenging ever since its initial discovery more than three decades ago. The recent discovery of Chromobacterium vaccinii as a cultivable FR producer enables the development of approaches leading to a high&#8208;yielding, scalable and sustainable biotechnological process for production of FR, thereby removing this bottleneck. Here we characterize different promoters in exchange of the native promoter of the FR assembly line, resulting in an overexpression mutant with significantly increased production of FR. Thereby, the isolation and structure elucidation of novel FR analogs of low abundance is enabled. Further, we explore the antiproliferative activities of fifteen chromodepsins against uveal melanoma cell lines harboring Gq/11 mutations and characterize the major metabolite of FR formed in plasma.

         <title>Piers&#8242; Borane&#8208;Induced Tetramerization of Arylacetylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocyclization: The formation of tetra&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrahydropentalenes upon the reaction of arylacetylenes with Piers&#8217; borane (HB(C6F5)2) is reported. Isotope labeling experiments and DFT computations indicate that the mechanism of this complex transformation commences with a series of unprecedented 1,2&#8208;carboborations, followed by an electrocyclization and two skeletal rearrangements.







Abstract
We herein report that the reaction of Piers&#8242; borane, i.&#8201;e. HB(C6F5)2, with an excess of arylacetylenes at room temperature leads to tetramerization of the acetylene and the diastereoselective formation of boryl&#8208;substituted tetra&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrahydropentalenes. The reaction mechanism was investigated by isotope labeling experiments and DFT computations. These investigations indicate that a series of 1,2&#8208;carboboration reactions form an octatetraene that undergoes an electrocyclization. Two skeletal rearrangements then presumably lead to the formation of the tetrahydropentalene core. Overall, this intricate and unprecedented transformation comprises five carbon&#8208;carbon bond formations in a single reaction.

         <title>Electrodeposition of Defect&#8208;Rich Ternary NiCoFe Layered Double Hydroxides: Fine Modulation of Co3+ for Highly Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defective but efficient: The binder&#8208;free Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)/NF, with a unique nanoarray structural feature, was fabricated as a high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalyst towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)/NF showed the optimized electronic structure and exposed more defects than Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)&#8208;bulk and Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)&#8208;mono prepared by traditional coprecipitation method. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)/NF demonstrated excellent electrochemical activity with an overpotential of 209&#8197;mV for OER at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;abundance and durable layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been considered as promising electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the easy agglomeration of lamellar LDHs in the aqueous phase limits their practical applications. Herein, a series of ternary NiCoFe LDHs were successfully fabricated on nickel foam (NF) via a simple electrodeposition method. The as&#8208;prepared Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)/NF displayed an unique nanoarray structural feature. It showed an OER overpotential of 209&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline solution, which was superior to most systems reported so far. As evidenced by the XPS and XAFS results, such excellent performance of Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)/NF was attributed to the higher Co3+/Co2+ ratio and more defects exposed, comparing with Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)&#8208;bulk and Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)&#8208;mono LDHs prepared by conventional coprecipitation method. Furthermore, the ratio of Co to Fe could significantly tune the Co electronic structure of Ni(CoxFe1&#8208;x)/NF composites (x=0.25, 0.50 and 0.75) and affect the electrocatalytic activity for OER, in which Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)/NF showed the lowest energy barrier for OER rate&#8208;determining step (from O* to OOH*). This work proposes a facile method to develop high&#8208;efficiency OER electrocatalysts.

         <title>Coexistence of Tellurium Cations and Anions in Phosphonium&#8208;Based Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grey tellurium dissolves under disproportionation in the ionic liquids [P66614][OAc] and [P4444][OAc] at ambient temperatures. The stable red&#8208;purple solutions contain tellurium cations, such as (Te4)2+ and (Te6)4+, and anions (Ten)2&#8722; with chain lengths up to at least n=5, as evidenced by spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques. DFT calculations indicate that electrostatic interactions with the components of the ILs stabilize tellurium cations and anions in solution.







Abstract
Elemental tellurium readily dissolves in ionic liquids (ILs) based on tetraalkylphosphonium cations even at temperatures below 100&#8201;&#176;C. In the case of ILs with acetate, decanoate, or dicyanamide anions, dark red to purple colored solutions form. A study combining NMR, UV&#8208;Vis and Raman spectroscopy revealed the formation of tellurium anions (Ten)2&#8722; with chain lengths up to at least n=5, which are in dynamic equilibrium with each other. Since external influences could be excluded and no evidence of an ionic liquid reaction was found, disproportionation of the tellurium is the only possible dissolution mechanism. Although the spectroscopic detection of tellurium cations in these solutions is difficult, the coexistence of tellurium cations, such as (Te4)2+ and (Te6)4+, and tellurium anions could be proven by cyclic voltammetry and electrodeposition experiments. DFT calculations indicate that electrostatic interactions with the ions of the ILs are sufficient to stabilize both types of tellurium ions in solution.

         <title>Selective Encapsulation and Unusual Stabilization of&#160;cis&#8208;Isomers by a Spherical Polyaromatic Cavity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To explore new cavity functions, we herein employed&#160;  cis&#8208;trans  &#160; stereoisomers &#160; with a N=N, C=C, or C=N unit as guest indicators for a polyaromatic capsule. Thanks to the rigid, spherical cavity with a diameter of ~1 nm, azobenzene and stilbene derivatives are quantitatively encapsulated by the capsule with 100%&#160;  cis  &#8208;selectivity in water. The isomerization of the&#160;  cis  &#8208;azo compound is suppressed against heat and light in the cavity, due to the confinement effect. Furthermore,&#160;  C,N  &#8208;diphenyl imine derivatives are quantitatively encapsulated by the capsule in water and adopt an otherwise unstable&#160;  cis  &#8208;form. The polyaromatic cavity suppresses the hydrolysis of the imines in water, even at elevated temperature, due to the shielding effect. Accordingly, the properties of the&#160;  cis&#8208;trans  &#160; isomers &#160;could be largely altered through supramolecular manipulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Portrait of a Family of Highly Stabilizing and Selective Guanine Quadruplex Platinum(II)&#8208;Based Binders</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and biophysical screening of guanine quadruplex stabilization and binding properties of a family of platinum di&#8208;imine complexes are described. The second&#8208;generation binders display enhanced stabilization and selectivity compared to the parent compound, bearing much promise for the future evolution of this novel platform.







Abstract
The long&#8208;standing history of platinum coordination complexes in nucleic acid recognition attests to the unique suitability of such species for therapeutic applications. Here, we report the synthetic exploration and development of a family of di&#8208;imine ligands, and their platinum(II) complexes, elaborated on a 3&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3&#8208;a]pyridine platform which, in its unsubstituted form, has recently been shown to display exceptional capabilities for guanine quadruplex (G4) targeting. The identification of facile, high&#8208;yielding synthetic methods for the derivatization of this platform for the incorporation of additional sites of interactions with guanine quadruplex loops and grooves, along with the optimization of platinum(II) complexation methods, are discussed. Gratifyingly, preliminary biophysical screening of this novel family of binders validates all but one family members as robust G4 binders and highlights enhanced selectivity for quadruplex versus duplex DNA compared to the parent compound. These results bear promise for practical developments based on this platform.

         <title>Heteropolymetallic Architectures as Snapshots of Transmetallation Processes at Different Degrees of Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel heteropolymetallic architectures have been built by integrating Pd, Au and Ag systems. The dinuclear [(CNC)(PPh 3 )Pd&#8208; G11 M(PPh 3 )](ClO 4 ) ( G11 M = Au ( 3 ), Ag ( 4 ); CNC = 2,6&#8208;diphenylpyridinate) and trinuclear [{(CNC)(PPh 3 )Pd} 2 G11 M](ClO 4 ) ( G11 M = Au ( 6 ), Ag ( 5 )) complexes have been accessed or isolated. Structural and DFT characterization unveil striking interactions of one of the aryl groups of the CNC ligand(s) with the G11 M center, suggesting these complexes constitute models of transmetallation processes. Further analyses allow to qualitatively order the degree of transfer, proving that Au promotes the highest one and also that Pd systems favor higher degrees than Pt. Consistently, Energy Decomposition Analysis calculations show that the interaction energies follow the order Pd&#8208;Au &gt; Pt&#8208;Au &gt; Pd&#8208;Ag &gt; Pt&#8208;Ag. All these results offer potentially useful ideas for the design of bimetallic catalytic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Insights on Allosteric Effect and Dynamic Structural Feature of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 Spike Protein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>COVID&#8208;19 caused by SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 is currently continuing to surge globally. The spike (S) protein is the key protein of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 that recognizes and binds to the host target ACE2. In this study, molecular dynamics simulation was used to elucidate the allosteric effect of S protein. The binding of ACE2 caused a centripetal movement of the receptor&#8208;binding domain of the S protein. The dihedral changes of Phe329 and Phe515 played a key role in this process. Two potential cleavage sites S1/S2 and S2' were exposed on the surface after the binding of ACE2. The binding affinity of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 S protein and ACE2 was significantly higher than that of SARS&#8208;COV. This was mainly due to the mutation of Asp480 in SARS&#8208;COV to Ser494 in SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2, which greatly weakened the electrostatic repulsion. The result provides theoretical basis for the SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 infection and aids the development of biosensors and detection reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Modulation on Optical Anisotropy Driven by Metal Cation Polyhedra in Fluorooxoborates MIIB4O6F2 (MII = Be, Mg, Pb, Zn, Cd)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enhancement mechanism of birefringence is very important to modulate optical anisotropy and materials design. Herein, the different cations extending from alkaline&#8208;earth to alkaline&#8208;earth,  d  10  electron configuration, and 6s  2  lone pair cations are highlighted to explore the influence on the birefringence. A flexible fluorooxoborate framework  from AEB  4  O  6  F  2  (AE = Ca, Sr) is adopted for UV/deep&#8208;UV birefringent structures, namely, M  II  B  4  O  6  F  2  (M  II  = Be, Mg, Pb, Zn, Cd). The maximal enhancement on birefringence can reach 46.6% with the cation substitution from Ca, Sr to Be, Mg (  route&#8208;I  ), Pb (route&#8208;II), and Zn, Cd (route&#8208;III). The influence of the cation size, the stereochemically active lone pair, and the binding capability of metal cation polyhedra is investigated for the hierarchical improvement on birefringence. Significantly, the BeB  4  O  6  F  2  structure features the shortest UV cutoff edge 146 nm among the available anhydrous beryllium borates with birefringence over 0.1 at 1064 nm  ,  and the PbB  4  O  6  F  2  structure has the shortest UV cutoff edge 194 nm within the reported anhydrous lead borates that hold birefringence larger than 0.1 at 1064 nm. This work sheds light on how metal cation polyhedra modulate birefringence, which suggests a credible design strategy to obtain desirable birefringent structures by cation control.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkynylgold(I) C3&#8208;Chiral Concave Complexes: Aggregation and Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkynylgold(I) C3&#8208;symmetric complexes bearing triphenyl (1) and trialkyl phosphine ligands (2 and 3) were synthesized and studied. In CHCl3/MeOH mixtures 1 and 2 showed an AIE effect at 540&#8197;nm, probably originating from aurophilic interactions. 3 showed AIE only in nearly pure MeOH and in the solid state. The aggregation of optically pure 1 started at lower MeOH content than (&#177;)&#8208;1, indicating that the latter gave racemates rather than conglomerates.







Abstract
Chiral gold(I) acetylide trinuclear complexes 1&#8211;3 based on the cyclotribenzylene platform and terminal PR3 ligands (R=Ph, Et, and Cy, respectively), were characterized and their light emission studied. They exhibited long&#8208;lived blue phosphorescence in CHCl3 and a weak fluorescence in the UV. In MeOH/CHCl3 mixtures of &gt;1:1 volume ratio, 1 and 2 exhibited a new emission band at ca. 540&#8197;nm that developed at the expense of the UV emission. DLS studies demonstrated the presence of molecular aggregates of &#216; 30&#8211;80&#8197;nm. The green emission observed in MeOH&#8208;rich solvent mixtures was therefore induced by aggregation, and could originate from Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au interactions. The AIE spectrum of 3 was observed only in solutions containing 99&#8201;% of MeOH, and correlated with its solid state emission. The AIE profiles of the enantiomers of 1 differed from that of rac&#8208;1, suggesting that the latter is a true racemate.

DLS studies demonstrated the presence of molecular aggregates of &#216; 30&#8211;80&#8197;nm. The green emission observed in MeOH-rich solvent mixtures was therefore induced by aggregation, and could originate from Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au interactions. The AIE spectrum of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; was observed only in solutions containing 99&#8201;% of MeOH, and correlated with its solid state emission. The AIE profiles of the enantiomers of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; differed from that of &lt;i&gt;rac&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, suggesting that the latter is a true racemate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Applications of SAPO&#8208;34 Molecular Sieves</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond the conventional: SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieves have excellent form selection and controllability in the chemical industry, as well as being one of the best industrial catalysts for converting methanol to olefin. The synthesis methods and applications of conventional, hierarchical, and nanosized SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieves are introduced in this review, and the advantages and shortcomings of each synthesis method are compared, along with their physicochemical properties and catalytic performance.







Abstract
Silicoaluminophosphate zeolite (SAPO&#8208;34) has been attracting increasing attention due to its excellent form selection and controllability in the chemical industry, as well as being one of the best industrial catalysts for methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefin (MTO) reaction conversion. However, as a microporous molecular sieve, SAPO&#8208;34 easily generates carbon deposition and rapidly becomes inactivated. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the crystal size of the zeolite or to introduce secondary macropores into the zeolite crystal to form a hierarchical structure in order to improve the catalytic effect. In this review, the synthesis methods of conventional SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieves, hierarchical SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieves and nanosized SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieves are introduced, and the properties of the synthesized SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieves are described, including the phase, morphology, pore structure, acid source, and catalytic performance, in particular with respect to the synthesis of hierarchical SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieves. We hope that the review can provide guidance to the preparation of the SAPO&#8208;34 catalysts, and stimulate the future development of high&#8208;performance hierarchical SAPO&#8208;34 catalysts to meet the growing demands of the material and chemical industries.

         <title>Nanostructured Manganese Oxides within a Ring&#8208;Shaped Polyoxometalate Exhibiting Unusual Oxidation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of discrete 18 and 20 nuclear nanostructured manganese oxides, Mn18 and Mn20, respectively, were synthesized inside a ring&#8208;shaped polyoxometalate cavity, and Mn18 showed much higher catalytic activity than other manganese oxides for the aerobic oxygenation of alkylarenes through a unique reaction mechanism.







Abstract
Nanosized manganese oxides have recently received considerable attention for their synthesis, structures, and potential applications. Although various synthetic methods have been developed, precise synthesis of novel nanostructured manganese oxides are still challenging. In this study, using a structurally defined nanosized cavity inside a ring&#8208;shaped polyoxometalate, we succeeded in synthesizing two types of discrete 18 and 20 nuclear nanostructured manganese oxides, Mn18 and Mn20, respectively. In particular, Mn18 showed much higher catalytic activity than other manganese oxides for the oxygenation of alkylarenes including electron&#8208;deficient ones, and the reaction proceeded through a unique reaction mechanism due to its unusual manganese oxide structure.

         <title>BBr3&#8208;Mediated P(III)&#8208;Directed C&#8722;H Borylation of Phosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron Chemistry. An efficient metal&#8208;free system has been uncovered for the site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of phosphines directed by P(III) atom just using BBr3. This robust method enables the rapid construction of phosphine boronate esters in selective, practical, low&#8208;cost, and environmentally friendly modes.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H borylation has been widely used in the preparation of organoboron compounds. Here, we developed a general protocol on metal&#8208;free P(III)&#8208;directed C&#8722;H borylation of phosphines mediated by BBr3, resulting in the formation of products bearing both phosphorus and boron. The development of the metal&#8208;free strategy to mimic previous metallic processes has shown low cost, superior practicality, and environmental friendliness. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate the preferred pathway for this metal&#8208;free directed C&#8722;H borylation process.

         <title>Understanding the Influence of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Diazo Compounds on the Catalyst Efficiency of B(C6F5)3 Towards Carbene Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:  Diazo compounds have been largely used for carbene transfer reactions in a variety of functionalization reactions. Recently, tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C  6  F  5  )  3  ] has been shown to be an efficient metal&#8208;free catalyst for carbene transfer reactions. Herein, we report a  Density Functional Theory  (DFT) study on the generation of carbene species from &#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;&#8208;diazocarbonyl compounds using catalytic amounts of B(C  6  F  5  )  3  . We observe that the efficiency of the catalyst depends directly on the nature of the substituents on both the aryl ring and the carbonyl group of the substrate. In some cases, we observe that the boron catalyst has negligible effect on the ease of the carbene formation, while in other cases there is a dramatic reduction in the activation energy of the reaction. This direct dependence is not commonly observed in catalysis and our finding opens the way for intelligent design of this and other similar catalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the Lewis Acidity of Boronic Acids through Interactions with Arene Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boronic acids are Lewis acids that exist in equilibrium with boronate forms in aqueous solution. Here we experimentally and computationally investigated the Lewis acidity of 2,6&#8208;diarylphenylboronic acids, specially designed phenylboronic acids that possess two flanking aromatic rings with tunable aromatic character. Hammett analysis of 2,6diarylphenylboronic acids reveals that their Lewis acidity remains unchanged upon the introduction of EWG/EDG at the distant para position of the flanking aromatic rings. Structural and computational studies demonstrate that polar&#8211;&#960; interactions and solvation effects contribute to the stabilization of boronic acids and boronate forms by aromatic rings. Our physical&#8208;organic chemistry work highlights that boronic acids and boronates can be stabilized by aromatic systems, leading to an important molecular knowledge for rational design and development of boronic acid&#8208;based catalysts and inhibitors of biomedically important proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>C(spn)&#8211;X (n = 1&#8211;3) Bond Activation by Palladium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have studied the palladium&#8208;mediated activation of&#160;C(  sp  n  )&#8211;X&#160;bonds (n = 1&#8211;3 and X = H, CH  3  , Cl) in archetypal model substrates H  3  C&#8211;CH  2  &#8211;X, H  2  C=CH&#8211;X and HC&#8801;C&#8211;X by catalysts PdL  n  &#160;with L  n  &#160;= no ligand, Cl  &#8211;  , and (PH  3  )  2  , using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;BLYP/TZ2P. The oxidative addition barrier decreases along this series, even though the strength of the bonds increases&#160;going from&#160;C(  sp  3  )&#8211;X, to&#160;C(  sp  2  )&#8211;X, to&#160;C(  sp  )&#8211;X. Activation strain and matching energy decomposition analyses reveal that the decreased oxidative addition barrier going from&#160;  sp  3  &#160;to&#160;  sp  2  &#160;to&#160;  sp  , originates from a reduction in the destabilizing steric (Pauli) repulsion between catalyst and substrate. This is the direct consequence of the decreasing coordination number of the carbon atom in&#160;C(  sp  n  )&#8211;X, which goes from four, to three, to two&#160;along this series. The associated net stabilization of the catalyst&#8211;substrate interaction dominates the trend in strain energy which indeed becomes more destabilizing along this same series as the bond becomes stronger from&#160;C(  sp  3  )&#8211;X&#160;to&#160;C(  sp  )&#8211;X.</dc:description>

         <title>Develop the low&#8208;temperature oxidation mechanism&#160;of cyclopentane: an&#160;experimental&#160;and theoretical study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>At present, the reactivity of cyclic alkanes is estimated by analogy comparison&#160;with non&#8208;cyclic hydrocarbons. Due to the difference in the structure of cycloalkanes and non&#8208;cycloalkanes, the thermodynamic data obtained by analogy is not applicable. In this study, a molecular beam sampling vacuum ultraviolet photoionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometer (MB&#8208;VUV&#8208;PI&#8208;TOFMS) was applied to study the low&#8208;temperature oxidation of cyclopentane (CPT) at a total pressure range from 1&#8208;3 atm&#160;and low&#8208;temperature range between 500 K and 800&#160;K. The low&#8208;temperature reaction products including cyclic olefins, cyclic ethers, highly oxygenated intermediates (e.g., ketohydroperoxide KHP, keto&#8208;dihydroperoxide KDHP, olefinic hydroperoxides OHP and ketone structure products) were observed. Further investigation of&#160;the oxidation of CPT, the electronic structure calculations at the&#160;UCCSD(T)&#8208;F12a/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVDZ//B3LYP/6&#8208;31+ G(d,p)&#160;level&#160;were carried out to explore the reactivity of O2&#160;molecules adding sequentially&#160;to cyclopentyl radicals.&#160;Experimental and theoretical observations showed that the dominant product channel in the reaction of CPT radicals with O2&#160;is HO2&#160;elimination, yielding cyclopentene. The pathways of second and third O2&#160;addition, the dissociation of hydroperoxide were further confirmed. The results of this study will develop the low&#8208;temperature oxidation mechanism of CPT, which can be used for future research on accurately simulating the combustion process of CPT.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetra&#8208;substituted p&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcalix[4]arene with phosphoryl and salicylamide functional groups: synthesis, complexation and selective extraction of f&#8208;element cations</title>

         <dc:description>A new series of lanthanide (  1&#8208;5  ) and uranyl (  6  ) complexes with a tetra&#8208;substituted bifunctional calixarene ligand  H  2  L  is described. The coordination environment for the Ln  3+  and UO  2  2+  ions is provided by phosphoryl and salicylamide functional groups appended to the lower rim of the  p&#8208;tert  &#8208;butylcalix[4]arene scaffold. Ligand interactions with lanthanide cations (light: La  3+  , Pr  3+  ; intermediate: Eu  3+  and Gd  3+  ; and heavy: Yb  3+  ), as well as the uranyl cation (UO  2  2+  ) is examined in the solution and solid state, respectively with spectrophotometric titration and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry. The ligand is fully deprotonated in the complexation of trivalent lanthanide ions forming di&#8208;cationic complexes 2:2 M:  L  , [Ln  2  (  L  )  2  (H  2  O)]  2+  (  1  &#8208;  5  ), in solution, whereas uranyl formed a 1:1 M:  L  complex [UO  2  (  L  )(MeOH)]  &#8734;  (  6  ) that demonstrated very limited solubility in 12 organic solvents. Solvent extraction behaviour is examined for cation selectivity and extraction efficiency.  H  2  L  was found to be an effective extracting agent for UO  2  2+  over La  3+  and Yb  3+  cations. The separation factors at pH 6.0 are: [[EQUATION]] = 121.0 and [[EQUATION]] = 70.0.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Channel Engineering for Rapid Ion Transport: From Nature to Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by rapid and selective ion transport behaviours commonly identified in biological systems, ion transport properties in solid and liquid crystals are crucial for electrochemical ion storage in rechargeable batteries, including electrode materials and electrolytes, which are critically reviewed and summarized. It is expected that this review could provide some new design principles for high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries based on this understanding of natural ion transport phenomena.







Abstract
Ion transport behaviours through cell membranes are commonly identified in biological systems, which are crucial for sustaining life for organisms. Similarly, ion transport is significant for electrochemical ion storage in rechargeable batteries, which has attracted much attention in recent years. Rapid ion transport can be well achieved by crystal channels engineering, such as creating pores or tailoring interlayer spacing down to the nanometre or even sub&#8208;nanometre scale. Furthermore, some functional channels, such as ion selective channels and stimulus&#8208;responsive channels, are developed for smart ion storage applications. In this review, the typical ion transport phenomena in the biological systems, including ion channels and pumps, are first introduced, and then ion transport mechanisms in solid and liquid crystals are comprehensively reviewed, particularly for the widely studied porous inorganic/organic hybrid crystals and ultrathin inorganic materials. Subsequently, recent progress on the ion transport properties in electrodes and electrolytes is reviewed for rechargeable batteries. Finally, current challenges in the ion transport behaviours in rechargeable batteries are analysed and some potential research approaches, such as bioinspired ultrafast ion transport structures and membranes, are proposed for future studies. It is expected that this review can give a comprehensive understanding on the ion transport mechanisms within crystals and provide some novel design concepts on promoting electrochemical ion storage capability in rechargeable batteries.

Controlling the hydrogen reduction of molybdenum trioxide to molybdenum dioxide and eventually metallic molybdenum with desirable morphology is a topic of continual scientific interest. Herein, this work presents a method of forming a wide range of grain sizes of the crucial molybdenum dioxide intermediary product by the adjustment of parameters such as temperature, water content and potassium content, further elucidating this first reduction step.







Abstract
During the reduction of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) to metallic molybdenum, the first reduction step yielding molybdenum dioxide as an intermediary product is of crucial importance. In this study, we examined the impact of the parameters reduction temperature, water influx, and potassium content on the hydrogen reduction of this first reaction step. Beginning from the same starting material, the chemical vapor transport mechanism was utilized to yield the phase pure MoO2. Analyses including powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, inductively coupled plasma&#8208;mass spectrometry, scanning electron microscopy, and high performance optical microscopy were performed on the product phases. Modulations of the specific surface areas of molybdenum dioxide ranging from 2.28 to 0.41&#8197;m2/g were possible. Furthermore, a distinct shift from small plate&#8208;like grains to cuboid&#8208;like forms was achieved.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Direct Oxidation of Primary Amines to Carboxylic Acids through Tandem ortho&#8208;Naphthoquinone&#8208;Catalyzed and TBHP&#8208;Promoted Oxidation Sequence</title>

         <dc:description>
A tandem oxidation sequence of amines to carboxylic acids is developed through the o&#8208;NQ&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation of amines to imines followed by the radical&#8208;initiated TBHP&#8208;promoted oxidation of imine intermediates. Mechanistically, the selective imine formation by o&#8208;NQ catalyst system is facilitated by the assistance of TBAI, also critical in the following TBHP&#8208;promoted oxidation of imine derivatives to break down the imines to aldehydes and amines. In turn, the released amines re&#8208;enter into the o&#8208;NQ catalytic cycle to produce the imine intermediates.







Abstract
Biomimetic oxidation of primary amines to carboxylic acids has been developed where the copper&#8208;containing amine oxidase (CuAO)&#8208;like o&#8208;NQ&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation was combined with the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)&#8208;like TBHP&#8208;mediated imine oxidation protocol. Notably, the current tandem oxidation strategy provides a new mechanistic insight into the imine intermediate and the seemingly simple TBHP&#8208;mediated oxidation pathways of imines. The developed metal&#8208;free amine oxidation protocol allows the use of molecular oxygen and TBHP, safe forms of oxidant that may appeal to the industrial application.

The reaction of [(NacnacNi)2tol] with white phosphorus, yellow arsenic and the interpnictogen compound AsP3 leads in dependence of the temperature to different complexes ([(NacnacNi)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2,&#954;1:&#951;2,&#954;1&#8208;E4)] and the paramagnetic [(NacnacNi)2(&#956;,&#951;3&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8208;E3)] (E=P, As)). The reduction was performed with KC8 and leads to similar but also different structured products. Thus, a large variety of different polypnictogen units are formed coordinated by nickel nacnac complexes.







Abstract
The reactivity of white phosphorus and yellow arsenic towards two different nickel nacnac complexes is investigated. The nickel complexes [(L1Ni)2tol] (1, L1=[{N(C6H3iPr2&#8208;2,6)C(Me)}2CH]&#8722;) and [K2][(L1Ni)2(&#956;,&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;N2)] (6) were reacted with P4, As4 and the interpnictogen compound AsP3, respectively, yielding the homobimetallic complexes [(L1Ni)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2,&#954;1:&#951;2,&#954;1&#8208;E4)] (E=P (2&#8201;a), As (2&#8201;b), AsP3 (2&#8201;c)), [(L1Ni)2(&#956;,&#951;3&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8208;E3)] (E=P (3&#8201;a), As (3&#8201;b)) and [K@18&#8208;c&#8208;6(thf)2][L1Ni(&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;E4)] (E=P (7&#8201;a), As (7&#8201;b)), respectively. Heating of 2&#8201;a, 2&#8201;b or 2&#8201;c also leads to the formation of 3&#8201;a or 3&#8201;b. Furthermore, the reactivity of these compounds towards reduction agents was investigated, leading to [K2][(L1Ni)2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;P4)] (4) and [K@18&#8208;c&#8208;6(thf)3][(L1Ni)2(&#956;,&#951;3&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8208;E3)] (E=P (5&#8201;a), As (5&#8201;b)), respectively. Compound 4 shows an unusual planarization of the initial Ni2P4&#8208;prism. All products were comprehensively characterized by crystallographic and spectroscopic methods.

Simple indole&#8208;based merocyanines have been successfully designed as unfused nonfullerene acceptors for organic solar cells by forming dimers with A&#8722;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8722;A structure that have a facile synthesis, enhanced photostability compared to well&#8208;known ITIC acceptor, and high electron mobility in blend films. When blended with P3HT donor, one of dimers, i.&#8201;e. Z2, shows a good cell efficiency of 3.53&#8201;%.







Abstract
Merocyanine (MC) dyes exhibit facile synthesis and attractive optical properties, making them widely studied as the donor materials in organic solar cells (OSCs). In this study, for the first time, simple indole&#8208;based MCs are successfully designed as unfused nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) for OSCs by forming dimers with A&#8722;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8722;A structure, which possess enhanced photostability compared to the well&#8208;known ITIC acceptor and high electron mobility in blend films. When blended with P3HT donor, one of the dimers, i.&#8201;e. Z2, shows a good cell efficiency of 3.53&#8201;%, which outperforms the performance of most of P3HT/NFA blends, particularly for unfused systems, and thus indicates good potential of simple MCs as NFAs.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Electronegativity and the Bridging of Chemical Bonding Concepts</title>

The orbital and the density, hand in hand: Three perspectives for conceptualizing chemical bonding are connected here within one framework: experimental quantum chemistry. A new definition for atoms inside molecules leads to quantification of atomic energy, partial charge, and in&#8208;situ electronegativity. Predictions follow, of pKa, of electronegativity inversions in polar bonds, and of hydrogen stabilization&#8208;driven electron&#8208;deficient bonding in diborane.







Abstract
One challenge in chemistry is the plethora of often disparate models for rationalizing the electronic structure of molecules. Chemical concepts abound, but their connections are often frail. This work describes a quantum&#8208;mechanical framework that enables a combination of ideas from three approaches common for the analysis of chemical bonds: energy decomposition analysis (EDA), quantum chemical topology, and molecular orbital (MO) theory. The glue to our theory is the electron energy density, interpretable as one part electrons and one part electronegativity. We present a three&#8208;dimensional analysis of the electron energy density and use it to redefine what constitutes an atom in a molecule. Definitions of atomic partial charge and electronegativity follow in a way that connects these concepts to the total energy of a molecule. The formation of polar bonds is predicted to cause inversion of electronegativity, and a new perspective of bonding in diborane and guanine&#8722;cytosine base&#8208;pairing is presented. The electronegativity of atoms inside molecules is shown to be predictive of pKa.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Amination of Drug&#8208;Like Benzoic Acids: Access to Anilines and Drug Conjugates through Directed Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation</title>

Added at the eleventh hour: A method for the late&#8208;stage directed amination of benzoic acids is presented. It allows rapid access to both small amino&#8208;functionalized analogues and large conjugates, including PROTACs, peptide conjugates and probes for chemical biology. Selection of the right catalyst and reagent enabled the use of high&#8208;throughput experimentation and automation.







Abstract
The functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds, ubiquitous in drugs and drug&#8208;like molecules, represents an important synthetic strategy with the potential to streamline the drug&#8208;discovery process. Late&#8208;stage aromatic C&#8722;N bond&#8211;forming reactions are highly desirable, but despite their significance, accessing aminated analogues through direct and selective amination of C&#8722;H bonds remains a challenging goal. The method presented herein enables the amination of a wide array of benzoic acids with high selectivity. The robustness of the system is manifested by the large number of functional groups tolerated, which allowed the amination of a diverse array of marketed drugs and drug&#8208;like molecules. Furthermore, the introduction of a synthetic handle enabled expeditious access to targeted drug&#8208;delivery conjugates, PROTACs, and probes for chemical biology. This rapid access to valuable analogues, combined with operational simplicity and applicability to high&#8208;throughput experimentation has the potential to aid and considerably accelerate drug discovery.

Annulating C60 fullerenes in NHC ligands enhances the catalysis of Ru&#8208;based olefin metathesis catalysis.







Abstract
Predictive catalysis must be the tool that does not replace experiments, but acts as a selective agent, so that synthetic strategies of maximum profitability are used in the laboratory in a surgical way. Here, nanotechnology has been used in olefin metathesis from homogeneous Ru&#8208;NHC catalysts, specifically annulating a C60 fullerene to the NHC ligand. Based on results with the C60 in the backbone, a sterile change with respect to the catalysis of the metal center, an attempt has been made to bring C60 closer to the metal, by attaching it to one of the two C&#8722;N bonds of the imidazole group of the SIMes (1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) ligand (reference NHC ligand of the 2nd generation Grubbs catalysts) to increase the steric pressure of C60 in the first sphere of reactivity of the metal. The DFT calculated thermodynamics and the kinetics of SIMes&#8208;derived systems show that they are efficient catalysts for olefin metathesis.

         <title>Incorporation of &#946;&#8208;Alanine in Cu(II) ATCUN Peptide Complexes Increases ROS Levels, DNA Cleavage and Antiproliferative Activity**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 72, Page 18093-18102, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Generation of reactive oxygen species was achieved with a redox&#8208;silent Cu(II) ATCUN complex by replacing the &#945;&#8208;amino acid glycine with &#946;&#8208;alanine. Increased ROS production led to higher oxidative DNA cleavage activity. The reasons for this higher activity were elucidated via potentiometry, cyclic voltammetry, EPR, UV/VIS spectroscopy and DFT. In cytotoxicity assays, &#946;&#8208;alanine peptide complexes showed lower IC50 values in several cancer cell lines compared with the glycine analogs, which could be correlated with the amounts of Cu taken up by cells.







Abstract
Redox&#8208;active Cu(II) complexes are able to form reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of oxygen and reducing agents. Recently, Faller et&#8197;al. reported that ROS generation by Cu(II) ATCUN complexes is not as high as assumed for decades. High complex stability results in silencing of the Cu(II)/Cu(I) redox cycle and therefore leads to low ROS generation. In this work, we demonstrate that an exchange of the &#945;&#8208;amino acid Gly with the &#946;&#8208;amino acid &#946;&#8208;Ala at position 2 (Gly2&#8594;&#946;&#8208;Ala2) of the ATCUN motif reinstates ROS production (&#8226;OH and H2O2). Potentiometry, cyclic voltammetry, EPR spectroscopy and DFT simulations were utilized to explain the increased ROS generation of these &#946;&#8208;Ala2&#8208;containing ATCUN complexes. We also observed enhanced oxidative cleavage activity towards plasmid DNA for &#946;&#8208;Ala2 compared to the Gly2 complexes. Modifications with positively charged Lys residues increased the DNA affinity through electrostatic interactions as determined by UV/VIS, fluorescence, and CD spectroscopy, and consequently led to a further increase in nuclease activity. A similar trend was observed regarding the cytotoxic activity of the complexes against several human cancer cell lines where &#946;&#8208;Ala2 peptide complexes had lower IC50 values compared to Gly2. The higher cytotoxicity could be attributed to an increased cellular uptake as determined by ICP&#8208;MS measurements.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Generation of reactive oxygen species&lt;/b&gt; was achieved with a redox-silent Cu(II) ATCUN complex by replacing the &#945;-amino acid glycine with &#946;-alanine. Increased ROS production led to higher oxidative DNA cleavage activity. The reasons for this higher activity were elucidated via potentiometry, cyclic voltammetry, EPR, UV/VIS spectroscopy and DFT. In cytotoxicity assays, &#946;-alanine peptide complexes showed lower IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values in several cancer cell lines compared with the glycine analogs, which could be correlated with the amounts of Cu taken up by cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redox-active Cu(II) complexes are able to form reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of oxygen and reducing agents. Recently, Faller et&#8197;al. reported that ROS generation by Cu(II) ATCUN complexes is not as high as assumed for decades. High complex stability results in silencing of the Cu(II)/Cu(I) redox cycle and therefore leads to low ROS generation. In this work, we demonstrate that an exchange of the &#945;-amino acid Gly with the &#946;-amino acid &#946;-Ala at position 2 (Gly2&#8594;&#946;-Ala2) of the ATCUN motif reinstates ROS production (&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&lt;/sup&gt;OH and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Potentiometry, cyclic voltammetry, EPR spectroscopy and DFT simulations were utilized to explain the increased ROS generation of these &#946;-Ala2-containing ATCUN complexes. We also observed enhanced oxidative cleavage activity towards plasmid DNA for &#946;-Ala2 compared to the Gly2 complexes. Modifications with positively charged Lys residues increased the DNA affinity through electrostatic interactions as determined by UV/VIS, fluorescence, and CD spectroscopy, and consequently led to a further increase in nuclease activity. A similar trend was observed regarding the cytotoxic activity of the complexes against several human cancer cell lines where &#946;-Ala2 peptide complexes had lower IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values compared to Gly2. The higher cytotoxicity could be attributed to an increased cellular uptake as determined by ICP-MS measurements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A series of isostructural actinide (Th, U&#8722;Pu) complexes with N,N&#8217;&#8208;ethylene&#8208;bis((pyrrole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methanimine) (H2L, H2pyren) reveal different An&#8722;Nimine vs. An&#8722;Npyrrolide bond lengths and covalent character of the An&#8722;N bonds. Comparison to the [An(salen)2] complexes displays a slightly weaker overall bond strength of pyren to AnIV (An=Th, U, Np, Pu), except for PaIV.







Abstract
We report a series of isostructural tetravalent actinide (Th, U&#8722;Pu) complexes with the N&#8208;donor ligand N,N&#8217;&#8208;ethylene&#8208;bis((pyrrole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methanimine) (H2L, H2pyren). Structural data from SC&#8208;XRD analysis reveal [An(pyren)2] complexes with different An&#8722;Nimine versus An&#8722;Npyrrolide bond lengths. Quantum chemical calculations elucidated the bonding situation, including differences in the covalent character of the coordinative bonds. A comparison to the intensely studied analogous N,N&#8242;&#8208;ethylene&#8208;bis(salicylideneimine) (H2salen)&#8208;based complexes [An(salen)2] displays, on average, almost equal electron sharing of pyren or salen with the AnIV, pointing to a potential ligand&#8208;cage&#8208;driven complex stabilisation. This is shown in the fixed ligand arrangement of pyren and salen in the respective AnIV complexes. The overall bond strength of the pure N&#8208;donor ligand pyren to AnIV (An=Th, U, Np, Pu) is slightly weaker than to salen, with the exception of the PaIV complex, which exhibits extraordinarily high electron sharing of pyren with PaIV. Such an altered ligand preference within the early AnIV series points to a specificity of the 5f1 configuration, which can be explained by polarisation effects of the 5&#8201;f electrons, allowing the strongest f electron backbonding from PaIV (5f1) to the N donors of pyren.

         <title>Coordinatively Unsaturated Amidotitanocene Cations with Inverted &#963; and &#960; Bond Strengths: Controlled Release of Aminyl Radicals and Hydrogenation/Dehydrogenation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 72, Page 18175-18187, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amidotitanocene cations serve as versatile, &#8220;bottlable&#8221; precursors for a range of highly reactive species such as aminyl radicals, and active catalysts for hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions. Their catalytic performance in amine&#8208;silane dehydrocoupling is the highest recorded so far for an earth&#8208;abundant metal (TON up to 3960). The Ti&#8722;N interaction displays reversed &#963; and &#960; bond strengths, as shown by EDA&#8208;NOCV calculations.







Abstract
Cationic amidotitanocene complexes [Cp2Ti(NPhAr)][B(C6F5)4] (Cp=&#951;5&#8208;C5H5; Ar=phenyl (1&#8201;a), p&#8208;tolyl (1&#8201;b), p&#8208;anisyl (1&#8201;c)) were isolated. The bonding situation was studied by DFT (Density Functional Theory) using EDA&#8208;NOCV (Energy Decomposition Analysis with Natural Orbitals for Chemical Valence). The polar Ti&#8722;N bond in 1&#8201;a&#8211;c features an unusual inversion of &#963; and &#960; bond strengths responsible for the balance between stability and reactivity in these coordinatively unsaturated species. In solution, 1&#8201;a&#8211;c undergo photolytic Ti&#8722;N cleavage to release Ti(III) species and aminyl radicals &#8901;NPhAr. Reaction of 1&#8201;b with H3BNHMe2 results in fast homolytic Ti&#8722;N cleavage to give [Cp2Ti(H3BNHMe2)][B(C6F5)4] (3). 1&#8201;a&#8211;c are highly active precatalysts in olefin hydrogenation and silanes/amines cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling, whilst 3 efficiently catalyzes amine&#8208;borane dehydrogenation. The mechanism of olefin hydrogenation was studied by DFT and the cooperative H2 activation key step was disclosed using the Activation Strain Model (ASM).

Mediated synthesis: A strategy for the nickel&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of ketones using visible light and two carboxylic acid&#8208;derived substrates is presented. No expensive iridium catalysts are required, with eco&#8208;friendly Hantzsch ester acting as both the photosensitizer and photoreductant. A broad scope of synthesized ketones is presented along with spectroscopical and computational studies of the role of the different reactants.







Abstract
A simple visible light photochemical, nickel&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of ketones from carboxylic acid&#8208;derived precursors is presented. Hantzsch ester (HE) functions as a cheap, green and strong photoreductant to facilitate radical generation and also engages in the Ni&#8208;catalytic cycle to restore the reactive species. With this dual role, HE allows for the coupling of a large variety of radicals (1&#176;,2&#176;, benzylic, &#945;&#8208;oxy &amp; &#945;&#8208;amino) with aroyl and alkanoyl moieties, a new feature in reactions of this type. With both precursors deriving from abundant carboxylic acids, this protocol is a welcome addition to the organic chemistry toolbox. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions without the need for toxic metal reagents or bases and shows a wide scope, including pharmaceuticals and complex molecular architectures.

         <title>Synthesis of Extra&#8208;Large Pore, Large Pore and Medium Pore Zeolites Using a Small Imidazolium Cation as the Organic Structure&#8208;Directing Agent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 72, Page 18109-18117, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using a small&#8208;sized imidazolium cation of facile synthesis as the organic structure&#8208;directing agent, three germanosilicate zeolites with extra&#8208;large, large and medium pores were synthesized. For the recently reported extra&#8208;large pore zeolite &#8208;SYT, the location of the organic cations was studied by molecular simulations, confirmed by Rietveld refinement and compared to that reported for the original, sophisticated and expensive &#8208;SYT cation.







Abstract
One common strategy in the search for new zeolites is the use of organic structure&#8208;directing agents (OSDA). Typically, one seeks to achieve a high specificity in the structure&#8208;directing effect of the OSDA. This study shows, however, that an OSDA lacking strong specificity towards any particular zeolite may provide opportunities for discovery when other synthesis parameters are systematically screened. Thus, 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;n&#8208;propylimidazolium has allowed to crystallize the new large/medium pore zeolite HPM&#8208;16 as well as the recently reported extra&#8208;large pore &#8208;SYT and the medium/small pore and chiral STW. The sophisticated OSDA originally affording &#8208;SYT and the new simple OSDA have very little in common, both in terms of size, shape and flexibility, while both may still direct the synthesis of the same zeolite. In fact, molecular simulations show that the new OSDA is located in three different positions of the &#8208;SYT structure, including the discrete 8MR where the original organic could not fit.

         <title>N&#8208;Aryl and N&#8208;Alkyl Carbamates from 1 Atmosphere of CO2</title>

We have isolated and analyzed the reactivity of the key intermediate 1 formed during the Zn(OAc)2/phen&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of organic carbamates starting from amines, CO2, and Si(OMe)4. The reaction mechanism was analyzed by using DFT. The catalytic system was modified and various N&#8208;aryl and N&#8208;alkyl carbamates that could be used as industrially important polyurethane raw materials were synthesized by using atmospheric CO2.







Abstract
We have successfully isolated and characterized the zinc carbamate complex (phen)Zn(OAc)(OC(=O)NHPh) (1; phen=1,10&#8208;phenanthroline), formed as an intermediate during the Zn(OAc)2/phen&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of organic carbamates from CO2, amines, and the reusable reactant Si(OMe)4. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the direct reaction of 1 with Si(OMe)4 proceeds via a five&#8208;coordinate silicon intermediate, forming organic carbamates. Based on these results, the catalytic system was improved by using Si(OMe)4 as the reaction solvent and additives like KOMe and KF, which promote the formation of the five&#8208;coordinated silicon species. This sustainable and effective method can be used to synthesize various N&#8208;aryl and N&#8208;alkyl carbamates, including industrially important polyurethane raw materials, starting from CO2 under atmospheric pressure.

         <title>Tuning the Reactivity of a Substrate for SNAP&#8208;Tag Expands Its Application for Recognition&#8208;Driven DNA&#8208;Protein Conjugation</title>

Protein modular adaptors (MAs) are the ideal reaction model for recognition&#8208;driven modification of DNA as they contain both a sequence&#8208;specific DNA&#8208;binding domain and a self&#8208;ligating protein&#8208;tag. We have designed new substrates of SNAP&#8208;tag to realize sequence&#8208;selective rapid crosslinking by protein MAs with SNAP&#8208;tag.







Abstract
Recognition&#8208;driven modification has been emerging as a novel approach to modifying biomolecular targets of interest site&#8208;specifically and efficiently. To this end, protein modular adaptors (MAs) are the ideal reaction model for recognition&#8208;driven modification of DNA as they consist of both a sequence&#8208;specific DNA&#8208;binding domain (DBD) and a self&#8208;ligating protein&#8208;tag. Coupling DNA recognition by DBD and the chemoselective reaction of the protein tag could provide a highly efficient sequence&#8208;specific reaction. However, combining an MA consisting of a reactive protein&#8208;tag and its substrate, for example, SNAP&#8208;tag and benzyl guanine (BG), revealed rather nonselective reaction with DNA. Therefore new substrates of SNAP&#8208;tag have been designed to realize sequence&#8208;selective rapid crosslinking reactions of MAs with SNAP&#8208;tag. The reactions of substrates with SNAP&#8208;tag were verified by kinetic analyses to enable the sequence&#8208;selective crosslinking reaction of MA. The new substrate enables the distinctive orthogonality of SNAP&#8208;tag against CLIP&#8208;tag to achieve orthogonal DNA&#8208;protein crosslinking by six unique MAs.

         <title>Flexibility Control of Two&#8208;Dimensional Coordination Polymers by Crystal Morphology: Water Adsorption and Thermal Expansion</title>

Preparing nanoplates of flexible two&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers provides significant structural changes involving the contraction of undulating layers. Such crystal morphology and size effects on layer structures modulate the dual functions of water adsorption and anisotropic thermal expansion.







Abstract
Layer flexibility in two&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers (2D&#8208;CPs) contributes to several functional materials as it results in anisotropic structural response to external stimuli. Chemical modification is a common technique for modifying layer structures. This study demonstrates that crystal morphology of a cyanide&#8208;bridged 2D&#8208;CP of type [Mn(salen)]2[ReN(CN)4] (1) consisting of flexible undulating layers significantly impacts the layer configuration and assembly. Nanoplates of 1 showed an in&#8208;plane contraction of layers with a longer interlayer distance compared to the micrometer&#8208;sized rod&#8208;type particles. These effects by crystal morphology on the structure of the 2D&#8208;CP impacted the structural flexibility, resulting in dual&#8208;functional changes: the enhancement of the sensitivity of structural transformation to water adsorption and modification of anisotropic thermal expansion of 1. Moreover, the nanoplates incorporated new adsorption sites within the layers, resulting in the uptake of an additional water molecule compared to the micrometer&#8208;sized rods.

         <title>MicroRNA&#8208;Triggered Nanozymes Cascade Reaction for Tumor&#8208;Specific Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 72, Page 18201-18207, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microRNA&#8208;triggered nanozymes cascade platform was constructed for tumor&#8208;specific chemodynamic therapy. Glucose oxidase&#8208;like nanozyme and peroxidase&#8208;like nanozyme were brought into close proximity through hybridization with miRNA&#8208;21 in MCF&#8208;7 cancer cells, resulting in efficient production of hydroxyl radicals to kill cancer cells. The system presented enhanced catalytic activity and minimal off&#8208;target toxicity, and provided an effective strategy for tumor&#8208;specific chemodynamic therapy.







Abstract
Off&#8208;target toxicity and insufficient hydroxyl radicals (.OH) generation limit the further clinical application of nanozymes in chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Herein, we designed and constructed a microRNA&#8208;triggered nanozyme cascade platform for enhanced tumor&#8208;specific chemodynamic therapy. The nanozyme&#8208;based cascade reaction could be triggered successfully by the high expression of microRNA in cancer cells to generate more .OH, thus exhibiting excellent tumor&#8208;specific therapeutic performance. Our work provides a new dimension for tumor&#8208;specific chemodynamic therapy.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A microRNA-triggered&lt;/b&gt; nanozymes cascade platform was constructed for tumor-specific chemodynamic therapy. Glucose oxidase-like nanozyme and peroxidase-like nanozyme were brought into close proximity through hybridization with miRNA-21 in MCF-7 cancer cells, resulting in efficient production of hydroxyl radicals to kill cancer cells. The system presented enhanced catalytic activity and minimal off-target toxicity, and provided an effective strategy for tumor-specific chemodynamic therapy.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Size&#8208;Induced Inversion of Selectivity in the Acylation of 1,2&#8208;Diols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 72, Page 18084-18092, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis&#8208;base catalyzed acylation of aromatic 1,2&#8208;ethylenediols with anhydrides depends strongly on the size of the reagents and the &#960;&#8208;system of the diol. Steric effects have a larger impact on reactions of primary hydroxyl groups in the 1,2&#8208;diol as well as the monoester than those of secondary hydroxyl groups. For sterically demanding anhydrides this flips the selectivity towards secondary alcohols.







Abstract
Relative rates for the Lewis base&#8208;catalyzed acylation of aryl&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;diols with anhydrides differing in size have been determined by turnover&#8208;limited competition experiments and absolute kinetics measurements. Depending on the structure of the anhydride reagent, the secondary hydroxyl group of the 1,2&#8208;diol reacts faster than the primary one. This preference towards the secondary hydroxyl group is boosted in the second acylation step from the monoesters to the diester through size and additional steric effects. In absolute terms the first acylation step is found to be up to 35&#8197;times faster than the second one for the primary alcohols due to neighboring group effects.

         <title>Frontispiece: Photocatalytic Activity of Supported Metal Nanoparticles and Single Atoms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 72, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal nanoparticles (MNPs) and single atom catalysts (SACs) demonstrate photocatalytic behavior because of their unique coordination environment and electronic structure. The metallic photocatalysts can be implanted in porous materials such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) to enhance the photocatalytic activity by exploiting the merits of both the metal species and the porous catalyst supports.

We have successfully isolated the zinc carbamate complex (phen)Zn(OAc)(OC(=O)NHPh) (1, phen=1,10&#8208;phenanthroline), which is an intermediate in the Zn(OAc)2/phen&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of organic carbamates from CO2, amines, and Si(OMe)4. By analyzing the reaction mechanism based on the reactivity of 1 and DFT calculations, we improved the catalytic system and synthesized various organic carbamates&#8212;including polyurethane raw materials&#8212;by using CO2 at 1&#8197;atm.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 72, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aim of this review is to present precisely defined amphiphilic dendrons (dendritic wedges), generally based on known dendrimers (aryl ether, amidoamine, amide, quaternary carbon, alkyl ether, ester, main group element), their self&#8208;association properties, and their uses, in particular for encapsulation and delivery of bioactive entities. In most cases, the hydrophilic part is constituted by the terminal functions of the dendrons, whereas one or two hydrophobic tails are linked to the core. Read more in the Review article by E. Apartsin and A.&#8208;M. Caminade on page&#8197;17976&#8197;ff.

         <title>Front Cover: How 5&#8201;f Electron Polarisability Drives Covalency and Selectivity in Actinide N&#8208;Donor Complexes (Chem. Eur. J. 72/2021)</title>

N versus O donor: Isostructural complexes [An(pyren)2] (An=Th, U&#8211;Pu) with a pyrrole&#8208;based ligand (pyren) were synthesised and compared to the structural relative salen. Solid&#8208;state analysis and quantum chemical calculations reveal an increased bond strength to the imine nitrogen when changing the second donor from the dominant O to the softer N. In the complexes, the overall bond strength of salen exceeds pyren, except for the Pa case. This can be explained by a greater degree of polarizability for the Pa 5&#8201;f1 state. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J. M&#228;rz et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102849).

         <dc:description>
Rearrange and aromatise: After a thiourea derivative has been transformed to a benzothiazine heterocycle, thioquinoline heterocycles can be formed by gold catalysis. The stability of the products is represented by the low level in the railway, while the gold catalysis will help to overcome the energetic barrier represented by the mountains. More information can be found in the Communication by D. Salvador and M.&#8197;C. Gimeno (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103439).

         <title>Supramolecular Self&#8208;Associations of Amphiphilic Dendrons and Their Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 72, Page 17976-17998, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendrons are molecular trees, constituted of a tail (a trunk) to which several branches are attached. The different types of self&#8208;associations of amphiphilic dendrons at the air&#8208;water interface, as micelles or as vesicles is described. The properties of these associations of dendrons (direct or reverse micelles or vesicles) in particular as carriers of drugs or of DNA or siRNA, or as drugs by themselves is also discussed.







Abstract
This review presents precisely defined amphiphilic dendrons, their self&#8208;association properties, and their different uses. Dendrons, also named dendritic wedges, are composed of a core having two different types of functions, of which one type is used for growing or grafting branched arms, generally multiplied by 2 at each layer by using 1&#8594;2 branching motifs. A large diversity of structures has been already synthesized. In practically all cases, their synthesis is based on the synthesis of known dendrimers, such as poly(aryl ether), poly(amidoamine) (in particular PAMAM), poly(amide) (in particular poly(L&#8208;lysine)), 1&#8594;3 branching motifs (instead of 1&#8594;2), poly(alkyl ether) (poly(glycerol) and poly(ethylene glycol)), poly(ester), and those containing main group elements (poly(carbosilane) and poly(phosphorhydrazone)). In most cases, the hydrophilic functions are on the surface of the dendrons, whereas one or two hydrophobic tails are linked to the core. Depending on the structure of the dendrons, and on the experimental conditions used, the amphiphilic dendrons can self&#8208;associate at the air&#8208;water interface, or form micelles (eventually tubular, but most generally spherical), or form vesicles. These associated dendrons are suitable for the encapsulation of low&#8208;molecular or macromolecular bioactive entities to be delivered in cells. This review is organized depending on the nature of the internal structure of the amphiphilic dendrons (aryl ether, amidoamine, amide, quaternary carbon atom, alkyl ether, ester, main group element). The properties issued from their self&#8208;associations are described all along the review.

The developments in the area of temperature&#8208;controlled electrospray ionization mass spectrometry are reviewed and compared to other biophysical methods for characterizing folding and interactions. The designs of several TC&#8208;ESI sources are discussed, as well as selected applications.







Abstract
Native electrospray ionization (ESI) and nanoelectrospray ionization (nESI) allow researchers to analyze intact biomolecules and their complexes by mass spectrometry (MS). The data acquired using these soft ionization techniques provide a snapshot of a given biomolecules structure in solution. Over the last thirty years, several nESI and ESI sources capable of controlling spray solution temperature have been developed. These sources can be used to elucidate the thermodynamics of a given analyte, as well as provide structural information that cannot be readily obtained by other, more commonly used techniques. This review highlights how the field of temperature&#8208;controlled mass spectrometry has developed.

         <title>Photocatalytic Activity of Supported Metal Nanoparticles and Single Atoms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 72, Page 17999-18014, December 23, 2021. </description>

Metal nanoparticles (MNPs) and single atom catalysts (SACs) can be stabilized on porous supports including metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to enhance photocatalytic activity for environmental remediation and clean energy production.







Abstract
Photocatalysis has been known as one of the promising technologies due to its eco&#8208;friendly nature. However, the potential application of many photocatalysts is limited owing to their large bandgaps and inefficient use of the solar spectrum. One strategy to overcome this problem is to combine the advantages of heteroatom&#8208;containing supports with active metal centers to accurately adjust the structural parameters. Metal nanoparticles (MNPs) and single atom catalysts (SACs) are excellent candidates due to their distinctive coordination environment which enhances photocatalytic activity. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) have shown great potential as catalyst support for SACs and MNPs. The numerous combinations of organic linkers with various heteroatoms and metal ions provide unique structural characteristics to achieve advanced materials. This review describes the recent advancement of the modified MOFs, COFs and g&#8208;C3N4 with SACs and NPs for enhanced photocatalytic applications with emphasis on environmental remediation.

The direct synthesis of diaryl sulfones from aryl silanes, SO2 surrogate, and aryl iodides is performed thanks to an air&#8208;stable Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylative Hiyama cross&#8208;coupling. Experimental and theoretical studies support a Cu(I)/Cu(III)&#8208;based mechanism with fast insertion of the small molecule into the Cu&#8722;C bond of a copper&#8208;aryl intermediate.







Abstract
An air&#8208;tolerant Cu&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylative Hiyama cross&#8208;coupling reaction enabling the formation of diaryl sulfones is described. Starting from aryl silanes, DABSO and aryliodides, the reaction tolerates a large variety of polar functional groups (amines, ketones, esters, aldehydes). Control experiments coupled with DFT calculations shed light on the mechanism, characterized by the formation of a Cu(I)&#8208;sulfinate intermediate via fast insertion of a SO2 molecule.

         <title>Parts&#8208;per&#8208;Million&#8208;Level, Catalytic [3+2]&#8208;Annulations for the Asymmetric Synthesis of Methanobenzo[7]annulenes</title>

Methanobenzo[7]annulenes. Parts&#8208;per&#8208;million catalyst loading for [3+2]&#8208;annulations. An unprecedented, ppm&#8208;level, catalytic asymmetric [3+2]&#8208;annulation of 3&#8208;alkyl&#8208;lawsones with nitroethylenes is reported. It is an efficient, sustainable, catalytic asymmetric annulation reaction for the synthesis of chiral methanobenzo[7]annulenes, which are part of many antibiotics.







Abstract
3&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;lawsones selectively reacted with &#945;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;nitroethylenes under 500 parts&#8208;per&#8208;million (ppm) quinine&#8208;NH&#8208;thiourea&#8208;catalysis to furnish the chiral methanobenzo[7]annulenes in up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee with &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and TON up to 1820 through tandem Michael/Henry [3+2]&#8208;annulations. These asymmetric ppm&#8208;level, catalytic tandem [3+2]&#8208;annulations would be highly inspirational for the design of many more ppm&#8208;level organocatalytic reactions, and at the same time these final molecules are basic skeletons of antibiotics.

         <title>Negishi Cross&#8208;Coupling Provides Alkylated Tryptophans and Tryptophan Regioisomers</title>

Non&#8208;canonical amino acids. The portfolio of possible late&#8208;stage derivatisations of biocatalytically halogenated tryptophan has been expanded by Palladium&#8208;catalysed Negishi cross coupling for a direct alkylation of bromotryptophan and the synthesis of tryptophan regioisomers from bromoindole derivatives.







Abstract
Mild transition&#8208;metal catalysed cross&#8208;couplings enable direct functionalisation of biocatalytically halogenated tryptophans with alkyl iodides, representing a new alternative for late&#8208;stage derivatisations of halogenated aromatic amino acids. Moreover, this strategy enables preparation of (homo)tryptophan regioisomers in a simple two&#8208;step synthesis using a Pd&#8208;catalysed Negishi cross coupling. This method provides access to non&#8208;canonical constitutional surrogates of tryptophan, ready for use in peptide synthesis.

         <title>From Thioureas to Thioquinolines through Isolated Benzothiazines by Gold Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
The selective synthesis of benzothiazine heterocycles starting from thioureas has been achieved. With gold catalysis, these organic compounds evolved in basic medium towards the formation of amino thioquinolines through an unprecedented aromatisation process of the heterocycle. The reaction was also carried out stoichiometrically by reaction with gold complexes to afford thioquinolines coordinated to the gold fragment.







Abstract
New benzothiazine heterocycles have been formed from thiourea derivatives by using different gold catalysts. The catalyst and the conditions were optimised towards the selective synthesis of six&#8208;membered benzothiazine heterocycles, characterised by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Interestingly, these organic compounds evolved under gold catalysis in basic medium to achieve the formation of amino thioquinolines through an unprecedented aromatisation process of the heterocycle. The reaction was also carried out stoichiometrically by reaction with gold complexes to afford thioquinolines coordinated to the gold fragment. Benzothiazine, amino thioquinoline heterocycles and gold&#8208;derived species have a great potential for biological applications.

         <title>Synthesis of Non&#8208;Aqueous Neptunium(III) Halide Solvates from NpO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 72, Page 18054-18057, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neptunium's fundamental chemistry is understudied when compared to the rest of the periodic table and early actinides like uranium and thorium. Therefore, synthesis of starting materials is of utmost importance for investigation of its chemical properties. NpO2 was dissolved in HCl and converted to two novel neptunium(III) solvated halides, NpI3(THF)4 and NpBr3(THF)4. The reported syntheses are convenient and do not require neptunium metal.







Abstract
Two Np(III) halides, NpI3(THF)4 and NpBr3(THF)4, have been prepared and isolated in high yields as described in this work. Starting with neptunia (NpO2), NpCl4(DME)2 was first generated in an updated, higher yielding synthesis than what was previously reported by using HCl/HF. This material was then reduced with KC8, followed by subsequent ligand exchange, to generate NpBr3(THF)4 and NpI3&#8208;(THF)4. Full characterization by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, 1H NMR spectroscopy and electronic absorption spectroscopy confirmed the molecular formulas and oxidation states. These trivalent materials are straightforward to synthesize and can be used as starting materials for non&#8208;aqueous Np(III) chemistry, obviating the need for rare and restricted Np metal and elemental halogens.

         <dc:description>Bistable spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) complexes that undergo abrupt and hysteretic (&#916;  T  1/2  ) spin&#8208;state switching are desirable for molecule&#8208;based switching and memory applications.

Stable spin&#8208;state switching&#8212;  T  1/2  = 288 K; &#916;  T  1/2  = 62 K&#8212;is observed for  1  , whereas  2  underwent above room&#8208;temperature lattice&#8208;solvent content&#8208;dependent SCO&#8212;  T  1/2  = 331 K; &#916;  T  1/2  = 43 K. Variable temperature single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of the complexes revealed pronounced molecular reorganizations&#8212;from the Jahn&#8208;Teller distorted HS&#8208;state to less distorted LS&#8208;state&#8212;and conformation switching of the ethyl group of the COOEt substituent upon SCO. Consequently, we propose that the large structural reorganizations rendered SCO hysteretic in  1  and  2  . Such insights shedding light on the molecular origin of thermal hysteresis might enable the design of technologically relevant molecule&#8208;based switching and memory elements.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive soft materials enable controlled release of loaded drug molecules and biomolecules. Controlled release of potent chemotherapeutic or immunotherapeutic agent is crucial to reduce unwanted side effects. In an effort to develop controlled release strategies that can be triggered using Cerenkov luminescence, we have developed polymer hydrogels that can release bovine serum albumin and immunoglobulin G using light (254 nm &#8211; 375 nm) as a trigger. We describe the synthesis and photochemical characterization of two light sensitive phenacyl bis&#8208;azide crosslinkers that are used to prepare transparent self&#8208;supporting hydrogel patches. One crosslinker was designed to optimize the overlap with the Cerenkov luminescence emission window, bearing an &#960;&#8208;extended phenacyl core, resulting in a high quantum yield (14%) of photocleavage when irradiated with 375 nm light. We used the extended phenacyl crosslinker for the preparation of protein&#8208;loaded dextran hydrogel patches, which showed efficient and selective dosed release of bovine serum albumin or immunoglobulin G after irradiation with 375 nm light. Cerenkov&#8208;triggered release is as yet inconclusive due to unexpected side&#8208;reactivity. Based on the high quantum yield, efficient release and large overlap with the Cerenkov window, we envision application of these photosensitive soft materials in radiation targeted drug release.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Advancing understanding of using alkali&#8208;metal alkoxides as additives to organomagnesium reagents in Mg&#8208;Br exchange reactions, a homologous series of mixed&#8208;ligand alkyl/alkoxide alkali&#8208;metal magnesiates [MMg(CH2SiMe3)2(dmem)]2[dmem= 2&#8208;{[2&#8208;(dimethylamino)ethyl]methylamino} ethoxide; M= Li,&#160;1; Na,&#160;2; (THF)K,&#160;3] has been prepared. Structural and spectroscopic studies have established the constitutions of these heteroleptic/heterometallic species, which are retained in arene solution. Evaluation of their reactivity towards 2&#8208;bromoanisole has uncovered a marked alkali&#8208;metal effect with potassium magnesiate&#160;3&#160;being the most efficient of the three ate reagents. Studies probing the constitution of the exchange product from this reaction suggest that the putative [KMgAr2(dmem)]2&#160;(Ar=&#160;o&#8208;OMe&#8208;C6H4)&#160;intermediate undergoes redistribution into its single metal components [KAr]n&#160;and [MgAr(dmem)]2&#160;(5). This process can be circumvented by using a different potassium alkoxide containing an aliphatic chain such as KOR&#8217; (R&#8217;= 2&#8208;ethylhexyl) which undergoes co&#8208;complexation with Mg(CH2SiMe3) to give [KMg(CH2SiMe3)2(OR&#8217;)]2&#160;(7). This ate, in turn, reacts quantitatively with 2&#8208;bromoanisole furnishing [KMgAr2(OR&#8217;)]2&#160;(9) which is stable in solution as a bimetallic compound. Collectively this work highlights the complexity of these alkali&#8208;metal mediated Mg&#8208;Br exchange reactions, where each reaction component can have a profound effect not only on the success of the reaction; but also the stability of the final metalated intermediates prior to their electrophilic interception.</dc:description>

         <title>Comparative Study of Nitro and Azide Functionalized Zn(II) based Coordination Polymers as Fluorescent Turn&#8208;on Probes for Rapid and Selective Detection of H2S in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective Detection of H  2  S in cellular system using fluorescent CPs/MOFs is of great scientific interest due to their outstanding aqueous stability, biocompatibility and real&#8208;time detection ability.&#160; Fabrication of such materials using complete biologically essential elements and applying them as an efficient biosensors is still quite challenging. &#160;In this context, we present two newly synthesized CPs containing biologically essential metal ion (Zn) and nitro/azido functional group on the framework to sense extracellular and intracellular H  2  S by reducing into respective amines. &#160;The CP&#8208;  1 containing the azide group acted as an efficient fluorencent turn&#8208;on probe with lowest detection limit (7.2 &#181;M) and shortest response time (30 sec) among the Zn&#8208;based probes reported till date.&#160; Moreover, CP&#8208;1 exhibited green luminescence in live cells after imaging very low concentration of H  2  S, while the nitro analogue, CP&#8208;2, couldn&#8217;t detect the target analyte due to it&#8217;s framework disruption.</dc:description>

         <title>A Stereoselective Glycosylation Approach to the Construction of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;Glycosidic Linkages and Convergent Synthesis of Saponins</title>

Direct action: A highly stereoselective glycosylation protocol for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;l&#8208;glycosidic linkages is disclosed, which employs a combination of glycosyl N&#8208;phenyltrifluroacetimidates as donors, FeCl3 as promoter, and CH2Cl2/nitrile as solvent and exploits glycosidation via glycosyl &#945;&#8208;nitrilium intermediates. A variety of natural saponins containing (1&#8594;2)&#8208;linked glycan motifs are thus synthesized in convergent manner by direct glycosylation with (1&#8594;2)&#8208;linked glycan donors.







Abstract
Conventional syntheses of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;l&#8208;glycosidic linkages rely mainly on neighboring group participation in the glycosylation reactions. The requirement for a neighboring participation group (NPG) excludes direct glycosylation with (1&#8594;2)&#8208;linked glycan donors, thus only allowing stepwise assembly of glycans and glycoconjugates containing this type of common motif. Here, a robust glycosylation protocol for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;l&#8208;glycosidic linkages without resorting to NPG is disclosed; it employs an optimal combination of glycosyl N&#8208;phenyltrifluroacetimidates as donors, FeCl3 as promoter, and CH2Cl2/nitrile as solvent. A broad substrate scope has been demonstrated by glycosylations with 12 (1&#8594;2)&#8208;linked di&#8208; and trisaccharide donors and 13 alcoholic acceptors including eight complex triterpene derivatives. Most of the glycosylation reactions are high yielding and exclusively 1,2&#8208;trans selective. Ten representative, naturally occurring triterpene saponins were thus synthesized in a convergent manner after deprotection of the coupled glycosides. Intensive mechanistic studies indicated that this glycosylation proceeds by SN2&#8208;type substitution of the glycosyl &#945;&#8208;nitrilium intermediates. Importantly, FeCl3 dissociates and coordinates with nitrile into [Fe(RCN)nCl2]+ and [FeCl4]&#8722;, and the ferric cationic species coordinates with the alcoholic acceptor to provide a protic species that activates the imidate, meanwhile the poor nucleophilicity of [FeCl4]&#8722; ensures an uninterruptive role for the glycosidation.

         <title>Rhodium and Iridium Complexes of Anionic Thione and Selone Ligands Derived from Anionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taken under its wing: Anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes that bear a weakly coordinating fluoroborate moiety have been used to prepare a new class of anionic imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;thione and &#8208;selone ligands; their coordination chemistry towards rhodium and iridium was explored to reveal, inter alia, their ability to develop secondary arene&#8208;metal interactions with the &#8220;wings&#8221; of the carbene ligands.







Abstract
The lithium salts of anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic thiones and selones [{(WCA&#8208;IDipp)E}Li(toluene)] (1: E=S; 2: E=Se; WCA=B(C6F5)3, IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene), which contain a weakly coordinating anionic (WCA) borate moiety in the imidazole backbone were reacted with Me3SiCl, to furnish the silylated adducts (WCA&#8208;IDipp)ESiMe3 (3: E=S; 4: E=Se). The reaction of the latter with [(&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5)MCl2]2 (M=Rh, Ir) afforded the rhodium(III) and iridium(III) half&#8208;sandwich complexes [{(WCA&#8208;IDipp)E}MCl(&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5)] (5&#8211;8). The direct reaction of the lithium salts 1 and 2 with a half or a full equivalent of [M(COD)Cl]2 (M=Rh, Ir) afforded the monometallic complexes [{(WCA&#8208;IDipp)E}M(COD)] (9&#8211;12) or the bimetallic complexes [&#956;2&#8208;{(WCA&#8208;IDipp)E}M2(COD)2(&#956;2&#8208;Cl)] (13&#8211;16), respectively. The bonding situation in these complexes has been investigated by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, revealing thiolate or selenolate ligand character with negligible metal&#8208;chalcogen &#960;&#8208;interaction.

         <title>Expanding the Scope of Polyoxometalates as Artificial Proteases towards Hydrolysis of Insoluble Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of artificial proteases able to hydrolyze insoluble proteins in the presence of surfactants remains essential for their structural characterization. Therefore, we report for the first time metal&#8208;substituted Keggin&#8208;type polyoxometalate complexes (M&#8208;K 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 where M = Zr(IV) or Hf(IV)) as catalysts for the hydrolysis of a fully insoluble protein, zein, in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) via a competitive binding mechanism, which results in a dependence of the hydrolysis on the surfactant concentration.







Abstract
Despite the enormous importance of insoluble proteins in biological processes, their structural investigation remains a challenging task. The development of artificial enzyme&#8208;like catalysts would greatly facilitate the elucidation of their structure since currently used enzymes in proteomics largely lose activity in the presence of surfactants, which are necessary to solubilize insoluble proteins. In this study, the hydrolysis of a fully insoluble protein by polyoxometalate complexes as artificial proteases in surfactant solutions is reported for the first time. The hydrolysis of zein as a model protein was investigated in the presence of Zr(IV) and Hf(IV) substituted Keggin&#8208;type polyoxometalates (POMs), (Et2NH2)10[M(&#945;&#8208;PW11O39)2] (M = Zr or Hf), and different concentrations of the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Selective hydrolysis of the protein upon incubation with the catalyst was observed, and the results indicate that the hydrolytic selectivity and activity of the POM catalysts strongly depends on the concentration of surfactant. The molecular interactions between the POM catalyst and zein in the presence of SDS were explored using a combination of spectroscopic techniques which indicated competitive binding between POM and SDS towards the protein. Furthermore, the formation of micellar superstructures in ternary POM/surfactant/protein solutions has been confirmed by conductivity and Dynamic Light Scattering measurements.

         <title>Interfacially Super&#8208;Assembled Benzimidazole Derivative&#8208;Based Mesoporous Silica Nanoprobe for Sensitive Copper (II) Detection and Biosensing in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique mesoporous silica nanoprobe (DHBM&#8208;MSN) based on benzimidazole derivative is constructed for the highly sensitive and selective detection of Cu2+. The designed DHBM&#8208;MSN has obvious quenching effect on Cu2+ in aqueous solution with extremely low detection limit. The detection system is successfully applied to detect Cu2+ in bovine serum, juice and live cells. The results indicate that DHBM&#8208;MSN fluorescent sensor holds great potential in practical and biomedical applications.







Abstract
Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) functionalized with benzimidazole&#8208;derived fluorescent molecules (DHBM) are fabricated via a feasible interfacial superassembly strategy for the highly sensitive and selective detection of Cu2+. DHBM&#8208;MSN exhibits an obvious quenching effect on Cu2+ in aqueous solutions, and the detection limit can be as low as 7.69&#215;10&#8722;8&#8197;M. The DHBM&#8208;MSN solid&#8208;state sensor has good recyclability, and the silica framework can simultaneously improve the photostability of DHBM. Two mesoporous silica nanoparticles with different morphologies were specially designed to verify that nanocarriers with different morphologies do not affect the specific detectionability. The detection mechanism of the fluorescent probe was systematically elucidated by combining experimental results and density function theory calculations. Moreover, the detection system was successfully applied to detect Cu2+ in bovine serum, juice, and live cells. These results indicate that the DHBM&#8208;MSN fluorescent sensor holds great potential in practical and biomedical applications.

         <title>Catalytic Reduction of Oximes to Hydroxylamines: Current Methods, Challenges and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How to access hydroxylamine derivatives? Likely, one of the most straightforward strategy involves the catalytic reduction of oximes. These substrates are however difficult to reduce selectively as overeduction breaks their weak N&#8722;O bond giving primary amines instead. The few different capable catalytic systems are overviewed in this minireview as well as new opportunities for advancing the research field are suggested.







Abstract
Catalytic reduction of oximes represents a direct efficient approach to synthesize valuable hydroxylamine derivatives. However this transformation presents significant challenges: oximes are hard to reduce and, if reactive, reductive cleavage of the weak N&#8722;O bond often leads to primary amine side products. The first suitable systems involved the use of platinum&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts with hydrogen as reductant and stoichiometric amounts of a strong Br&#248;nsted acid. More recently metal&#8208;free and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based homogeneous catalysts have been developed, which display the highest turnovers (up to 4000). In the asymmetric variants, the E/Z&#8208;geometry of the oxime double bond affects significantly the stereoselectivity, sometimes requiring extra synthetic efforts in substrate preparation. This minireview provides an overview of the advances and limitations in catalytic oxime to hydroxylamine reduction. Emphasis is put on highlighting and comparing the practical aspects of the existing methods, such as their reaction conditions and substrate scope. Additionally, future directions for improving this young research area are suggested.

         <title>Bioinspired Artificial Photosynthetic Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different approaches to emulate functions of the native photosynthetic apparatus by artificial systems are introduced. One approach involves the integration of native photosynthetic systems with artificial materials onto electrode surfaces to yield photobioelectrochemical cells. A second approach involves the assembly of supramolecular photosensitizer/electron acceptor assemblies leading to the efficient light&#8208;induced formational of election&#8208;transfer redox products. A third approach addresses the design of dynamic networks stimulating controlled electron&#8208;transfer processes leading to the formation of fuel products under thermodynamically&#8208;guided or out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conditions.







Abstract
Mimicking photosynthesis using artificial systems, as a means for solar energy conversion and green fuel generation, is one of the holy grails of modern science. This perspective presents recent advances towards developing artificial photosynthetic systems. In one approach, native photosystems are interfaced with electrodes to yield photobioelectrochemical cells that transform light energy into electrical power. This is exemplified by interfacing photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII) as an electrically contacted assembly mimicking the native Z&#8208;scheme, and by the assembly of an electrically wired PSI/glucose oxidase biocatalytic conjugate on an electrode support. Illumination of the functionalized electrodes led to light&#8208;induced generation of electrical power, or to the generation of photocurrents using glucose as the fuel. The second approach introduces supramolecular photosensitizer nucleic acid/electron acceptor complexes as functional modules for effective photoinduced electron transfer stimulating the subsequent biocatalyzed generation of NADPH or the Pt&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;catalyzed evolution of molecular hydrogen. Application of the DNA machineries for scaling&#8208;up the photosystems is demonstrated. A third approach presents the integration of artificial photosynthetic modules into dynamic nucleic acid networks undergoing reversible reconfiguration or dissipative transient operation in the presence of auxiliary triggers. Control over photoinduced electron transfer reactions and photosynthetic transformations by means of the dynamic networks is demonstrated.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in water&#8208;dispersible gold nanoclusters in terms of their synthesis strategies, optical properties, and bio&#8208;applications is discussed. Different synthesis strategies for water&#8208;dispersible AuNCs are highlighted. The progress achieved in the optical properties and biological applications of these molecules is also reviewed. Finally, the challenges and opportunities for their further development of are presented.







Abstract
Atomically precise gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) are an emerging class of quantum&#8208;sized nanomaterials. Intrinsic discrete electronic energy levels have endowed them with fascinating electronic and optical properties. They have been widely applied in the fields of optoelectronics, photovoltaics, catalysis, biochemical sensing, bio&#8208;imaging, and therapeutics. Nevertheless, most AuNCs are synthesized in organic solvents and do not disperse in aqueous solutions; this restricts their biological applications. In this review, we focus on the recent progress in the preparation of water&#8208;dispersible AuNCs and their biological applications. We first review different methods of synthesis, including direct synthesis from hydrophilic templates and indirect phase transfer of hydrophobic AuNCs. We then discuss their photophysical properties, such as emission enhancement and fluorescence lifetimes. Next, we summarize their latest applications in the fields of biosensing, biolabeling, and bioimaging. Finally, we outline the challenges and potential for the future development of these AuNCs.

         <title>Label&#8208;Free Electrochemiluminescence Imaging of Single&#8208;Cell Adhesions by Using Bipolar Nanoelectrode Array</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A label&#8208;free method for fast and positive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging of single cells by bipolar nanoelectrode array is proposed using oxygen as the electrochemical probe. The successful imaging is achieved by transient generation of difference in oxygen concentration over the nanoelectrodes covered with or without cells. Thus, cell morphology and adhesion strength can be imaged.







Abstract
A label&#8208;free and fast approach for positive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging of single cells by bipolar nanoelectrode array is proposed. The reduction of oxygen at a platinized gold nanoelectrode array in a closed bipolar electrochemical system is coupled with an oxidative ECL process at the anodic side. For elevating the ECL imaging contrast of single cells, a driving voltage of &#8722;2.0&#8197;V is applied to in&#8197;situ generate oxygen confined beneath cells that is subsequently used for ECL imaging at 1.1&#8197;V. High oxygen concentration in the confined space resulting from steric hindrance generates prominent oxygen reduction current at the cathodic side and higher ECL intensity at the anodic side, allowing positive ECL imaging of the cells adhesion region with excellent contrast. Cell morphology and adhesion strength can be successfully imaged with high image acquisition rate. This approach opens a new avenue for label&#8208;free imaging of single cells.

For elevating the ECL imaging contrast of single cells, a driving voltage of &#8722;2.0&#8197;V is applied to in&#8197;situ generate oxygen confined beneath cells that is subsequently used for ECL imaging at 1.1&#8197;V. High oxygen concentration in the confined space resulting from steric hindrance generates prominent oxygen reduction current at the cathodic side and higher ECL intensity at the anodic side, allowing positive ECL imaging of the cells adhesion region with excellent contrast. Cell morphology and adhesion strength can be successfully imaged with high image acquisition rate. This approach opens a new avenue for label-free imaging of single cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organic Photocathode Supported by Copper Nanosheets Array for Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple Cu nanosheets array support structure was provided as the substrate of organic photocathode, which provides more reactive sites and increases the effective light absorption area. Furthermore, the introduction of Cu NSA increases the distribution range of the built&#8208;in electric field, thus improving the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers and the photocatalytic performance. The proposal of the simple support structure provides a direction for the design and implementation of spatially separated PEC cell.







Abstract
The Z&#8208;scheme overall solar water splitting is a mimic of natural photosynthesis to convert solar energy into chemical energy. Since the energy levels of most organic semiconductors match well with the hydrogen evolution potential, they have great application prospects as photocathodes in Z&#8208;scheme photoelectrochemical systems. However, due to the weak light absorption and difficult carrier separation, the photocurrent density and onset potential of organic photocathodes are still low. To solve these problems, we introduced a copper nanosheets array (Cu NSA) framework under organic layers to increase the surface reaction sites, improve the light absorption and enhance the distribution range of built&#8208;in electric field simultaneously. As a result, the photocurrent density and onset potential of poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene)&#8201;:&#8201;[6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid (P3HT&#8201;:&#8201;PCBM) photocathode were enhanced significantly. The onset potential increased by 50&#8197;mV to 0.65&#8197;V vs. RHE, and the photocurrent density reached &#8722;1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0&#8197;V vs. RHE, which was 18 times that of the sample without Cu NSA. The optimized photocathode was connected with titanium dioxide nanorods array photoanode in a tandem manner to realize the spontaneous overall water splitting. Without bias and co&#8208;catalyst, the photocurrent density was maintained at 110&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and the solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion efficiency was 0.14&#8201;% in neutral solution. These results provide a feasible method for optimizing the performance of organic photocathodes.

         <title>Merging of a Perylene Moiety Enables a RuII Photosensitizer with Long&#8208;Lived Excited States and the Efficient Production of Singlet Oxygen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two are better than one: In a joint study, groups in two laboratories at TU Braunschweig and Ulm University present a novel bichromophoric RuII complex. This unique photosensitizer was obtained by fusing a ruthenium polypyridine chromophore with an additional perylene dye. This photosensitizer exhibits a strong absorptivity in the visible region and an enhanced excited state lifetime of 8&#8197;&#956;s. In addition, this complex enables the efficient production of singlet oxygen. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Rau, S. Tschierlei, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103609).

         <dc:description>
The crystal structure of the cytochrome P450 AryC from arylomycin biosynthesis is shown surrounded by other decisive elements of AryC biocatalysis&#8212;such as the electron supply chain (bottom right) and molecular oxygen (center top)&#8212;and indicates the catalytic function of AryC on free linear peptide precursors without PCP tethering to regioselectively perform biaryl cross&#8208;coupling (top right; blue bond).

         <title>Maytansinol Derivatives: Side Reactions as a Chance for New Tubulin Binders</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interdisciplinary character of the Horizon2020&#8208;MSCA&#8208;EJD TubInTrain project allowed a challenging study of the peculiarity of maytansinoids as tubulin binders. The enthusiasm of PhD students proved fundamental for productively merging synthesis, biological evaluation, X&#8208;ray crystallography and docking studies. The good agreement of computational and experimental sheds further light on the intriguing chemical behavior of maytansinoids and provides a solid foundation for the future design, synthesis and analysis of next&#8208;generation maytansinoids.

         <dc:description>High&#8208;nuclearity clusters resemble the closest model between the determination of atomically precise chemical species and the bulk metallic version thereof, and both impacts on a variety of applications, including catalysis, optics, sensors, and new energy sources.&#160; Our interest lies with the nanoclusters of the Group 11 (Cu, Ag, Au) metals stabilized by dichalcogenido and hydrido ligands.&#160; Herein, we describe superatoms formed by the clusters and their relationship with precursor hydrido clusters.&#160; Specifically, our concept seeks to demonstrate a possible correlation that exist between hydrido clusters (and nanoalloys) and the formation of superatoms, with the loss of hydrides and typically with release of H  2  gas.&#160; These reactions appear to be internal self&#8208;redox reactions and require no additional reducing agent, but does seem to require a similar core structure.&#160; Knowledge of such processes could provide insight into how clusters grow and an understanding in bridging the atomically precise cluster &#8211; metal nanoparticle mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable surface electric field of electrode materials via constructing Schottky heterojunctions for selective conversion of trash ions to treasures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface electric field of catalyst is widely recognized as one of the key points to boost catalytic activity. However, there is still a lack of convenient ways to tune the surface electric field to selectively boost the catalytically conversions of different types of reactants in specific catalytic reaction. Here, we introduce a concept&#8208;new method to tune the surface electric field of electrode materials by adjusting the number and density of heterojunctions inside. Both theoretical and experimental results prove that the well&#8208;designed surface electric field of an electrocatalyst plays a key role in facilitating pre&#8208;adsorption and/or activation of reactants for selective conversion of trash ions to useful products in hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction and NO  x  &#8208;  reduction reaction.</dc:description>

However, the requirement for toxic and/or large access of activators needed for common glycosylations with thioglycosides remains a notable drawback.

         <title>Bioinspired Transformations Using Strictosidine Aglycones: Divergent Total Syntheses of Monoterpenoid Indole Alkaloids in the Early Stage of Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired transformations to convert strictosidine aglycones into monoterpenoid indole alkaloids are reported. An important biosynthetic transformation mediated by &#946;&#8208;glycosidase were replaced with a simple removal of the silyl group from designed strictosidine aglycone silyl ether derivatives. Subsequent bioinspired transformations under substrate control resulted in the concise and divergent total syntheses of heteroyohimbine&#8208; and corynantheine&#8208;type, akagerine and naucleaoral related alkaloids.







Abstract
A series of bioinspired transformations that are applied to convert strictosidine aglycones into monoterpenoid indole alkaloids is reported. The highly reactive key intermediates, strictosidine aglycones, were prepared in situ by simple removal of a silyl protecting group from the silyl ether derivatives, and converted selectively via bioinspired transformations under substrate control into heteroyohimbine&#8208; and corynantheine&#8208;type, and akagerine and naucleaoral related alkaloids. Thus, concise, divergent total syntheses of 13 monoterpenoid indole alkaloids, (&#8722;)&#8208;cathenamine, (&#8722;)&#8208;tetrahydroalstonine, (+)&#8208;dihydrocorynantheine, (&#8722;)&#8208;corynantheidine, (&#8722;)&#8208;akagerine, (&#8722;)&#8208;dihydrocycloakagerine, (&#8722;)&#8208;naucleaoral B, (+)&#8208;naucleidinal, (&#8722;)&#8208;naucleofficines D and III, (&#8722;)&#8208;nauclefiline, and (&#8722;)&#8208;naucleamides A and E, were accomplished in fewer than 13&#8197;steps.

         <title>Heteroallene Capture and Exchange at Functionalised Heptaphosphane Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three equivalents of heteroallene can be captured between the Si&#8722;P bonds of Zintl&#8208;derived clusters. Silyl coordination at either the nitrogen or chalcogen of the heteroallene can be controlled by tuning the groups on the silyl moiety or functional groups at the heteroallene. It was also found that one captured small molecule can be exchanged for another, evidencing small molecule catch and release at these clusters.







Abstract
Despite being known for decades the chemical reactivity of homoatomic seven&#8208;atom phosphorus clusters towards small molecules remains largely unexplored. Here, we report that neutral tris(silyl) functionalised heptaphosphane (P7(SiR3)3) cages are capable of heteroallene capture between the P&#8722;Si bonds of the cluster. A range of isocyanates and an isothiocyanate were investigated. In the case of isocyanates, silyl bonding at oxygen or nitrogen is regioselectively directed by the functional group on the isocyanate and substituents on the silyl moiety. Above all, we find that captured isothiocyanate molecules can be exchanged for isocyanate molecules, indicative of small molecule catch and release. Small molecule catch and release at these Zintl&#8208;derived clusters reveals their potential application as chemical storage materials or as reusable probes.

         <title>Utilisation of CO2 as &#8220;Structure Modifier&#8221; of Inorganic Solids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 is abundant and free but environmentally unfriendly. It is also unreactive, hence re&#8208;purposing can be a challenge. This research article describes how CO2 can be used as a useful reagent towards the preparation and/or chemical and structural modification of inorganic solids. This approach is of wide application hence, in the future, it may become part of a toolbox of methods to reduce the environmental impact of CO2.







Abstract
Utilisation of CO2 as a chemical reagent is challenging, due to the molecule's inherent chemical stability. However, CO2 reacts promptly at high temperature (&#8764;1000&#8201;&#176;C) with alkaline&#8208;earth oxides to form carbonates and such reactions are used towards capture and re&#8208;utilisation.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is abundant&lt;/b&gt; and free but environmentally unfriendly. It is also unreactive, hence re-purposing can be a challenge. This research article describes how CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be used as a useful reagent towards the preparation and/or chemical and structural modification of inorganic solids. This approach is of wide application hence, in the future, it may become part of a toolbox of methods to reduce the environmental impact of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilisation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a chemical reagent is challenging, due to the molecule's inherent chemical stability. However, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacts promptly at high temperature (&#8764;1000&#8201;&#176;C) with alkaline-earth oxides to form carbonates and such reactions are used towards capture and re-utilisation. In this work, this concept is extended and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is utilised as a reagent to modify the crystal structure of mixed-metal inorganic solids. Modification of the crystal structure is a &#8220;tool&#8221; used by materials scientists to tailor the physical property of solids. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas was reacted with several isostructural mixed-metal oxides Sr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Sr&lt;sub&gt;1.8&lt;/sub&gt;Ba&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;CuO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Ba&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PdO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. These oxides are carefully selected to show anion vacancies in their crystal structure, to act as host sites for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules, leading to the formation of carbonate anions, (CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Properties of Single&#8208;Component Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Crystal&#8208;Glass Composites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of single&#8208;component metal&#8211;organic framework crystal&#8208;glass composites (MOF&#8208;CGCs) were produced, where the materials contained a crystalline and glass phase from the same parent zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF): ZIF&#8208;62(Zn). The composites displayed thermal and adsorptive properties present in both the original crystalline and glass materials and interfacial compatibility between the two phases was evident. A mixed&#8208;metal Co/Zn analogue was also produced to further examine phase&#8208;mixing.







Abstract
The formation, and subsequent structural, thermal and adsorptive properties of single&#8208;component metal&#8211;organic framework crystal&#8208;glass composites (MOF&#8208;CGCs) are investigated. A series of novel materials exhibiting chemically identical glassy and crystalline phases within the same material were produced, where crystalline ZIF&#8208;62(Zn) was incorporated within an agZIF&#8208;62(Zn) matrix. X&#8208;ray diffraction showed that the crystalline phase was still present after heating to above the glass transition temperature of agZIF&#8208;62(Zn), and interfacial compatibility between the crystalline and glassy phases was investigated using a mixed&#8208;metal (ZIF&#8208;62(Co))0.5(agZIF&#8208;62(Zn))0.5 analogue. CO2 gas adsorption measurements showed that the CO2 uptakes of the MOF&#8208;CGCs were between those of the crystalline and glassy phases.

         <title>Electronic Circular Dichroism Imaging (ECDi) Casts a New Light on the Origin of Solid&#8208;State Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It depends how you look at it: By exploring randomly formed domains of microcrystalline finasteride dispersed in a KCl pellet with the spatial resolution of 0.1&#8197;mm granted by synchrotron source, we noticed that anisotropic ECDi (ACD) spectra might be very different from the emergent solid&#8208;state ECD spectrum recorded on a commercial instrument, which is similar to the solution ECD. Consequently, we got an exclusive insight into the critical role played by local domains.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state ECD (ss&#8208;ECD) spectra of a model microcrystalline solid, finasteride, dispersed into a KCl pellet were recorded by using the synchrotron radiation source at the Diamond B23 beamline. Scanning a surface of 36&#8197;mm2 with a step of 0.5&#8197;mm, we measured a set of ECD imaging (ECDi) spectra very different from each other and from the ss&#8208;ECD recorded with a bench&#8208;top instrument (1&#8197;cm2 area). This is due to the anisotropic part of the ECD (ACD), which averages to zero in solution or on a large number of randomly oriented crystallites, but can otherwise be extremely large. Two&#8208;way singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis, through experimental and simulated TDDFT spectra, disclosed that the measured and theoretical principal components are in line with each other. This finding demonstrates that the observed isotropic ss&#8208;ECD spectrum is governed by the anisotropy of locally oriented crystals. It also introduces a new quality for ss&#8208;ECD measurements and opens a new future for probing and mapping chiral materials in the solid state such as active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).

         <title>Increased Photostability of the Integral mRNA Vaccine Component N1&#8208;Methylpseudouridine Compared to Uridine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photodynamics of the methylated isomer, N1&#8208;methylpseudouridine (m1&#968;), which is commonly used in mRNA therapeutics were investigated alongside the canonical base uridine; m1&#968; was found to have a 12&#8208;fold longer 1&#960;&#960;* decay lifetime and a 5&#8208;fold higher fluorescence yield than uridine. However, following UVC irradiation m1&#968; is shown to be ca. 6.7&#8197;times more photostable than uridine.







Abstract
N1&#8208;Methylation of pseudouridine (m1&#968;) replaces uridine (Urd) in several therapeutics, including the Moderna and BioNTech&#8208;Pfizer COVID&#8208;19 vaccines. Importantly, however, it is currently unknown if exposure to electromagnetic radiation can affect the chemical integrity and intrinsic stability of m1&#968;. In this study, the photochemistry of m1&#968; is compared to that of uridine by using photoirradiation at 267&#8197;nm, steady&#8208;state spectroscopy, and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Furthermore, femtosecond transient absorption measurements are collected to delineate the electronic relaxation mechanisms for both nucleosides under physiologically relevant conditions. It is shown that m1&#968; exhibits a 12&#8208;fold longer 1&#960;&#960;* decay lifetime than uridine and a 5&#8208;fold higher fluorescence yield. Notably, however, the experimental results also demonstrate that most of the excited state population in both molecules decays back to the ground state in an ultrafast time scale and that m1&#968; is 6.7&#8208;fold more photostable than Urd following irradiation at 267&#8197;nm.

         <title>Synthesis of Redox&#8208;Active Photochromic Phenanthrene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of photochromic phenanthrene derivatives bearing pyridine or pyridinium units have been synthetized and characterized by spectroscopy, electrochemistry and theoretical calculations. It has been demonstrated that the different substitution positions yield to a drastic difference on the photo and electrochromic properties of these systems. These compounds derived from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons compounds show good qualities for the applications in optoelectronic devices, as opto&#8208;transistors or in organic field&#8208;effect transistors.







Abstract
A phenanthrene unit has been functionalized by several methylthiophene units in order to bring it a photochromic behavior. These compounds were characterized by NMR, absorption and emission spectroscopies, theoretical calculations as well as cyclic voltammetry. The association of a phenanthrene group with a photochromic center could open the door to a new generation of organic field&#8208;effect transistors.

         <title>Isolation of Cyclic Aluminium Polysulfides by Stepwise Sulfurization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NHC stabilized terphenyl dihydridoaluminium, the first monomeric aluminium hydride hydrogensulfide, the aluminium bis(hydrogensulfide), the six&#8208; or five&#8208;membered cyclic aluminium polysulfide as well as a rare five&#8208;membered heterocyclic aluminium sulfide were synthesized controllably in mild manners. Reactions of the known dihydridoaluminium and the terphenyl dihydridoaluminium with various thiation reagents formed a series of aluminium&#8208;sulfur species. This provided insights into the influence of the supporting ligands on the reactivity and stability.







Abstract
Despite the notable progress in aluminium chalcogenides, their sulfur congeners have rarely been isolated under mild conditions owing to limited synthetic precursors and methods. Herein, facile isolation of diverse molecular aluminium sulfides is achievable, by the reaction of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;stabilized terphenyl dihydridoaluminium (1) with various thiation reagents. Different to the known dihydridoaluminium 1Tipp, 1 features balanced stability and reactivity at the Al center. It is this balance that enables the first monomeric aluminium hydride hydrogensulfide 2, the six&#8208;membered cyclic aluminium polysulfide 4 and the five&#8208;membered cyclic aluminium polysulfide 6 to be isolated, by reaction with various equivalents of elemental sulfur. Moreover, a rare aluminium heterocyclic sulfide with Al&#8722;S&#8722;P five&#8208;membered ring (7) was obtained in a controlled manner. All new compounds were fully characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Their structures were confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies.

         <title>Coordination Cage&#8208;Based Emulsifiers: Templated Formation of Metal Oxide Microcapsules Monitored by In Situ LC&#8208;TEM</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled amphiphiles captured in action: Non&#8208;statistical self&#8208;assembly of heteroleptic coordination cages results in Gemini amphiphiles, able to stabilize non&#8208;aqueous emulsions. Serving as water&#8208;free medium, the emulsion&#8208;templated synthesis of metal oxide microcapsules from water&#8208;sensitive precursors can be carried out in controlled fashion. The formation of hollow metal oxide microcapsules was visualized by in&#8197;situ liquid cell transmission electron microscopy and elemental mapping.







Abstract
Metallo&#8208;supramolecular self&#8208;assembly has yielded a plethora of discrete nanosystems, many of which show competence in capturing guests and catalyzing chemical reactions. However, the potential of low&#8208;molecular bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assemblies in the development of structured inorganic materials has rarely been methodically explored so far. Herein, we present a new type of metallo&#8208;supramolecular surfactant with the ability to stabilize non&#8208;aqueous emulsions for a significant period. The molecular design of the surfactant is based on a heteroleptic coordination cage (CGA&#8208;3; CGA=Cage&#8208;based Gemini Amphiphile), assembled from two pairs of organic building blocks, grouped around two Pd(II) cations. Shape&#8208;complementarity between the differently functionalized components generates discrete amphiphiles with a tailor&#8208;made polarity profile, able to stabilize non&#8208;aqueous emulsions, such as hexadecane&#8208;in&#8208;DMSO. These emulsions were used as a medium for the synthesis of spherical metal oxide microcapsules (titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, and niobium oxide) from soluble, water&#8208;sensitive alkoxide precursors by allowing a controlled dosage of water to the liquid&#8208;liquid phase boundary. Synthesized materials were analyzed by a combination of electron microscopic techniques. In situ liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (LC&#8208;TEM) was utilized for the first time to visualize the dynamics of the emulsion&#8208;templated formation of hollow inorganic titanium oxide and zirconium oxide microspheres.

         <dc:description>Cu  2  O is an ideal p&#8208;type material for photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen evolution, while serious electron&#8208;hole recombination and photocorrosion restrict its further improvement of the PEC activity. In this work, CeO  2  nanoparticles (NPs) self&#8208;assemble on the Cu  2  O octahedra surface, successfully constructing Cu  2  O/CeO  2  structure in which p&#8208;n heterojunction and micro&#8208;mesocrystals (m&#8208;MCs) structure work together. The optimum Cu  2  O/CeO  2  composite without the use of any cocatalyst exhibits 5 times higher photocurrent density (4.63 mA cm  &#8208;2  at 0 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) than that of Cu  2  O octahedra, which is better than most Cu  2  O&#8208;based photocathodes without cocatalyst and even comparable with the advanced Cu  2  O&#8208;based photocathodes. The hydrogen production of the optimal Cu  2  O/CeO  2  (Faradaic efficiency of ~100%) is 17.5 times higher than that of pure Cu  2  O octahedra and the photocurrent shows almost no decay under the 12 h stability test. The delicately designed Cu  2  O/CeO  2  structure in this work provides reference and inspiration for the design of cathodes materials.</dc:description>

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Amino&#8208;iso&#8208;butyric acid foldamers terminated with rhodium(I) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To investigate how remotely induced changes in ligand folding might affect catalysis by organometallic complexes, dynamic &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;  iso  &#8208;butyric acid (Aib) peptide foldamers bearing rhodium(I) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes have been synthesised and studied. X&#8208;ray crystallography of a foldamer with an N&#8208;terminal azide and a C&#8208;terminal Rh(NHC)(Cl)(diene) complex showed a racemate with a chiral axis in the Rh(NHC) complex and a distorted 3  10  helical body. Replacing the azide with either one or two chiral L&#945;&#8208;methylvaline (L&#8208;&#945;MeVal) residues gave diastereoisomeric foldamers that each possessed point, helical and axial chirality. NMR spectroscopy revealed an unequal ratio of diastereoisomers for some foldamers, indicating that the chiral conformational preference of the N&#8208;terminal residue(s) was relayed down the 1 nm helical body to the axially chiral Rh(NHC) complex. Although the remote chiral residue(s) did not affect the stereoselectivity of hydrosilylation reactions catalysed by these foldamers, these studies suggest a potential pathway towards remote conformational control of organometallic catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Carboboration&#8208;Driven Generation of a Silylium Ion for Vinylic C&#8722;F Bond Functionalization by B(C6F5)3 Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed reactions between fluoroalkenes and silyl ketene acetals gave vinylic C&#8722;F bond&#8208;functionalized products under mild and simple conditions. Carboboration reaction of fluoroalkenes generates an oxygen&#8208;stabilized silylium ion to facilitate the C&#8722;F bond cleavage. DFT and IBO studies were performed to clear the reaction mechanism. A comparative study of &#945;&#8208;chloro or bromostyrenes demonstrated that our reaction can be applied only to &#945;&#8208;fluorostyrenes due to the strong silicon&#8208;fluorine affinity.







Abstract
Strong main&#8208;group Lewis acids such as silylium ions are known to effectively promote heterolytic C(sp3)&#8722;F bond cleavage. However, carrying out the C(sp2)&#8722;F bond transformation of vinylic C&#8722;F bonds has remained an unmet challenge. Herein, we describe our development of a new and simple strategy for vinylic C&#8722;F bond transformation of &#945;&#8208;fluorostyrenes with silyl ketene acetals catalyzed by B(C6F5)3 under mild conditions. Our theoretical calculations revealed that a stabilized silylium ion, which is generated from silyl ketene acetals by carboboration, cleaves the C&#8722;F bond of &#945;&#8208;fluorostyrenes. A comparative study of &#945;&#8208;chloro or bromostyrenes demonstrated that our reaction can be applied only to &#945;&#8208;fluorostyrenes because the strong silicon&#8208;fluorine affinity facilitates an intramolecular interaction of silylium ions with fluorine atom to cleave the C&#8722;F bond. A broad range of &#945;&#8208;fluorostyrenes as well as a range of silyl ketene acetals underwent this C&#8722;F bond transformation.

         <title>Prebiotically Plausible Autocatalytic Peptide Amyloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The plus side of amyloids? Peptide amyloids have an inherent templating ability that underlies the infectivity and progression of prion and other neurodegenerative diseases as well as guiding the synthesis of melanin. Such amyloid&#8208;based templating has been shown to support the sequence&#8208;selective, regioselective and stereoselective addition of amino acids to a complementary peptide chain. Here we report that the templating nature of amyloids also supports the autocatalytic self&#8208;replication of peptides. The relevance to a prebiotic role for amyloids is discussed.







Abstract
The prebiotic emergence of molecules capable both of self&#8208;replication and of storing information was a defining event at the dawn of life. Still, no plausible prebiotic self&#8208;replication of biologically relevant molecules has been demonstrated. Building upon the known templating nature of amyloids, we present two systems in which the products of a peptide&#8208;bond&#8208;forming reaction act as self&#8208;replicators to enhance the yield and stereoselectivity of their formation. This first report of an amino acid condensation that can undergo autocatalysis further supports the potential role of amyloids in prebiotic molecular evolution as an environment&#8208;responsive and information&#8208;coding system capable of self&#8208;replication.

         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) with specific response to the unique tumor microenvironment (TME) feature providing 100% metal atoms utilization for high&#8208;efficient enzyme&#8208;catalyzed therapy and accurate template for the study of therapeutic mechanisms. In this review, we first introduce the various synthetic strategies of SAzymes, and the TME&#8208;responsive SAzymes activities. Next, the TME&#8208;responsive enhanced antitumor therapeutic approaches based on the enzymatic activities of SAzymes are summarized, and the corresponding therapy mechanisms are elaborated. Subsequently, a concise but concentrated summary, and the challenges and opportunities for the future design and engineering of SAzyme are outlined. As a newly&#8208;built discipline, SAzymes have vast space for development in enhanced antitumor therapy. This timely review provides guidance and constructive suggestions for the future of SAzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Gas Phase Preparation of the Elusive  Monobridged Ge(&#181; &#8208;H)GeH Molecule via Non&#8208;Adiabatic Reaction Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hitherto elusive monobridged Ge(  &#181;  &#8208;H)GeH (X  1  A') molecule was prepared in gas phase through bimolecular reaction of atomic germanium (Ge) with germane (GeH  4  ). Merged with electronic structure calculations, this reaction was revealed to commence on the triplet surface with the formation of a van der Waals complex, followed by insertion of germanium into a germanium&#8208;hydrogen bond via a submerged barrier forming the triplet digermanylidene intermediate (HGeGeH  3  ); the latter underwent intersystem crossing from the triplet to singlet surface. On the singlet surface, HGeGeH  3  predominantly isomerized via two successive hydrogen shifts prior to unimolecular decomposition to Ge(  &#181;  &#8208;H)GeH isomer, which is in equilibrium with the vinylidene&#8208;type (H  2  GeGe) and di&#8208;bridged (Ge(  &#181;  &#8208;H  2  )Ge) isomers. This reaction leads to the formation of&#160;the cyclic dinuclear germanium molecules, which do not exist on the isovalent C  2  H  2  surface, deepening our understanding of the role of nonadiabatic reaction dynamics in preparing non&#8208;classical, hydrogen&#8208;bridged isomers carrying main group XIV elements.</dc:description>

         <title>MOF&#8211;stabilized perfluorinated palladium cages catalyze the additive&#8211;free aerobic oxidation of aliphatic alcohols to acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Extremely high electrophilic metal complexes, composed by a metal cation and very electron poor &#963;&#8211;donor ancillary ligands, are expected to be privileged catalysts for oxidation reactions in organic chemistry. However, their low lifetime prevents any use in catalysis. Here we show the synthesis of fluorinated pyridine&#8211;Pd  2+  coordinate cages within the channels of an anionic tridimensional metal organic framework (MOF), and their use as efficient metal catalysts for the aerobic oxidation of aliphatic alcohols to carboxylic acids without any additive. Mechanistic studies strongly support that the MOF&#8211;stabilized coordination cage with perfluorinated ligands unleashes the full electrophilic potential of Pd  2+  to dehydrogenate primary alcohols, without any base, and also to activate O  2  for the radical oxidation to the aldehyde intermediate. This study opens the door to design catalytic perfluorinated complexes for challenging organic transformations, where an extremely high electrophilic metal site is required.</dc:description>

         <title>Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Polarization in Hydrogenation Reactions Mediated by a Metal&#8208;Free Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report nuclear spin hyperpolarization of various alkenes achieved in alkyne hydrogenations with parahydrogen over a metal&#8208;free hydroborane catalyst (HCAT). Being intramolecular frustrated Lewis pair aminoborane, HCAT utilizes a non&#8208;pairwise mechanism of H  2  transfer to alkynes, which normally prevents from observing parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization (PHIP).

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We report nuclear spin hyperpolarization of various alkenes achieved in alkyne hydrogenations with parahydrogen over a metal-free hydroborane catalyst (HCAT). Being intramolecular frustrated Lewis pair aminoborane, HCAT utilizes a non-pairwise mechanism of H  2  transfer to alkynes, which normally prevents from observing parahydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP). Nevertheless, specific spin dynamics in catalytic intermediates leads to the hyperpolarization of predominantly one hydrogen in alkene. PHIP enabled detection of important HCAT-alkyne-H  2  intermediates via substantial  1  H,  11  B and  15  N signal enhancements and allowed advanced characterization of the catalytic process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Micro&#8208;Mesoporous Carbons from Cyclodextrin Nanosponges Enabling High&#8208;Capacity Silicon Anodes and Sulfur Cathodes for Lithiated Si&#8208;S Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A facile production strategy to synthesize Si and S directly within porous carbon derived from cyclodextrin nanosponges. These materials act as high capacity electrodes in Lithiated Si&#8722;S cells.







Abstract
Manufactured globally on industrial scale, cyclodextrins (CD) are cyclic oligosaccharides produced by enzymatic conversion of starch. Their typical structure of truncated cone can host a wide variety of guest molecules to create inclusion complexes; indeed, we daily use CD as unseen components of food, cosmetics, textiles and pharmaceutical excipients. The synthesis of active material composites from CD resources can enable or enlarge the effective utilization of these products in the battery industry with some economical as well as environmental benefits. New and simple strategies are here presented for the synthesis of nanostructured silicon and sulfur composite materials with carbonized hyper cross&#8208;linked CD (nanosponges) that show satisfactory performance as high&#8208;capacity electrodes. For the sulfur cathode, the mesoporous carbon host limits polysulfide dissolution and shuttle effects and guarantees stable cycling performance. The embedding of silicon nanoparticles into the carbonized nanosponge allows to achieve high capacity and excellent cycling performance. Moreover, due to the high surface area of the silicon composite, the characteristics at the electrode/electrolyte interface dominate the overall electrochemical reversibility, opening a detailed analysis on the behavior of the material in different electrolytes. We show that the use of commercial LP30 electrolyte causes a larger capacity fade, and this is associated with different solid electrolyte interface layer formation and it is also demonstrated that fluoroethylene carbonate addition can significantly increase the capacity retention and the overall performance of our nanostructured Si/C composite in both ether&#8208;based and LP30 electrolytes. As a result, an integration of the Si/C and S/C composites is proposed to achieve a complete lithiated Si&#8722;S cell.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Preparation of Fe/N/C Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts Containing Fe&#8722;N4 Sites from an Iron Complex Precursor with 5,6,7,8&#8208;Tetraphenyl&#8208;1,12&#8208;Diazatriphenylene Ligands</title>

         <dc:description>
Fe/N/C single&#8208;atom catalysts are prepared from iron complex precursors containing 5,6,7,8&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;1,12&#8208;diazatriphenylene ligands with two bromo substituents by one&#8208;step pyrolysis. The iron complex precursors were efficiently converted to atomically dispersed Fe&#8722;N4 active sites without generating less active iron aggregates during pyrolysis. The Fe&#8722;N4 active sites were identified by STEM&#8208;EELS observations and in&#8197;situ electrochemical Fe K edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopic measurements. The Fe/N/C catalysts show high catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Fe/N/C single&#8208;atom catalysts containing Fe&#8722;Nx sites prepared by pyrolysis are promising cathode materials for fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries due to their high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities. We have developed iron complexes containing N2&#8208; or N3&#8208;chelating coordination structures with preorganized aromatic rings in a 1,12&#8208;diazatriphenylene framework tethering bromo substituents as precursors to precisely construct Fe&#8722;N4 sites in an Fe/N/C catalyst. One&#8208;step pyrolysis of the iron complex with carbon black forms atomically dispersed Fe&#8722;N4 sites without iron aggregates. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and electrochemical measurements revealed that the iron complex with N3&#8208;coordination is more effectively converted to Fe&#8722;N4 sites catalyzing ORR with a TOF value of 0.21&#8197;e&#8201;site&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 0.8&#8197;V vs. RHE. This indicates that the formation of Fe&#8722;N4 sites is controlled by precise tuning of the chemical structure of the iron complex precursor.

         <title>Accessing Cationic &#945;&#8208;Silylated and &#945;&#8208;Germylated Phosphorus Ylides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Competition for the lone pair: Our paper describes efforts to access cationic &#945;&#8208;silylated (and &#945;&#8208;germylated) phosphorus ylides of the general formula [R3PC(R)SiR2]+. One inherent feature of these molecules is that the silyl and phosphonyl entities compete for the lone pair of electrons. The ambivalent nature of the possible resonance structures is reflected in the coloured segmentation of the cover feature.

     alt="Accessing Cationic &#945;-Silylated and &#945;-Germylated Phosphorus Ylides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Competition for the lone pair&lt;/b&gt;: Our paper describes efforts to access cationic &#945;-silylated (and &#945;-germylated) phosphorus ylides of the general formula [R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PC(R)SiR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. One inherent feature of these molecules is that the silyl and phosphonyl entities compete for the lone pair of electrons. The ambivalent nature of the possible resonance structures is reflected in the coloured segmentation of the cover feature. The two &#8220;competitors&#8221; are illustrated as sportspersons, and both resonance structures are represented depending on where the ball of positive change is.

         <title>An ESIPT&#8208;Dependent AIE Fluorophore Based on HBT Derivative: Substituent Positional Impact on Aggregated Luminescence and its Application for Hydrogen Peroxide Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two positional isomers are presented, p&#8208;BHBT and o&#8208;BHBT, and their structural feature is mainly different in one BT substituent position on HBT fluorophore. Surprisingly, they exhibited totally opposite luminescence behaviour in water/THF cosolvents with different water volume fractions (fw). More importantly, the unique AIE&#8208;ESIPT properties allowed p&#8208;BHBT to construct the chemosensor, Probe&#8208;1, for highly selective and sensitive detection of hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution and living cells, respectively.







Abstract
Aiming to develop the facile organic fluorophore possessing excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), we designed and synthesized two isomers with different linkage site between hydroxyl of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl) benzothiazole (HBT) and a benzothiazole substituent (para position refers to p&#8208;BHBT and ortho position refers to o&#8208;BHBT). Fluorescence emission properties of p&#8208;BHBT and o&#8208;BHBT in THF/water mixtures with different water volume fractions indicated an opposite luminescence in aggregates, in which p&#8208;BHBT showed an ESIPT&#8208;dependent AIE properties while o&#8208;BHBT displayed ESIPT effect and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) qualities. A possible mechanism for molecular actions to illustrate the aggregating luminescence alteration of these two isomers had been proposed and verified by theoretical and experimental studies. More importantly, Probe&#8208;1, generated from dual ESIPT&#8208;AIE fluorophore p&#8208;BHBT, was successfully used as a ratiometric fluorescent chemosensor for highly selective (above 15&#8208;fold over other ROS) and sensitive (69&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement with 0.22&#8197;&#956;M of detection limit) detection of hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution and living cells, respectively.

         <title>Light&#8208;assisted Ullmann coupling of phenols and aryl halides: The synergetic effect between plasmonic copper nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes from various sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing light and plastic wastes as resources to turn the wasted phenols and hazardous aryl halides into value added chemicals seems to be an attractive idea for alleviating the energy crisis and environmental problems. In this work, we loaded plasmonic copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) onto carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from various sources including commercial CNTs and those derived from plastic wastes. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation, the catalyst could efficiently convert phenols and aryl halides to diaryl ethers. Similar with commercial CNTs, excellent activity is also achieved when utilizing CNTs derived from different kinds of plastic wastes as support for the system. Further investigation shows that the visible&#8208;light irradiation and light&#8208;excited plasmonic Cu NPs are necessary to inhibit the phenol degradation on CNTs and in turn promote the cross&#8208;coupling of phenol and aryl halides. Compared with metal oxides and other carbon materials, the excellent capability of CNTs to absorb light, to convert light to heat, and to adsorb both two reactants simultaneously are critical to enhance the activity of Cu NPs, achieving the high yield of diaryl ethers. We believe that this study could provide a novel strategy for catalyst design and generate a more economically&#8208;sustainable process.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>"Xenophilic" complexes offer metal&#8208;metal bonds between disparate metal sites, but the nature of the metal&#8208;metal bonding is often unclear.

M&#246;ssbauer, magnetism and DFT analysis indicate that the most accurate electronic structure description is LFeII&#8592;Fe0(CO)2Cp, in which the Fe(CO)2Cp is low&#8208;spin iron(0) and acts as an X&#8208;type ligand toward the high spin iron(II) of the LFe fragment. This largely electro&#173;static interaction has a bond order of only 0.5. The three&#8208;coordinate high&#8208;spin iron(II) site has large zero&#8208;field splitting, and in addition its M&#246;ssbauer parameters can be used to rank the Fp&#8211;&#160;"metalloligand" as a donor; it is nearly as strong a donor as phosphides and alkyls.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Design Strategy for Orange&#8208;red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters in OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pure organic molecules based thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters have been successfully developed in recent years for their propitious application in highly efficient organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). In case of orange&#8208;red emitters, the non&#8208;radiative process is known to be a serious issue due to its lower lying singlet energy level. However, recent studies indicate that there are tremendous efforts put to develop efficient orange&#8208;red TADF emitters. And the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of heteroaromatic based orange&#8208;red TADF OLEDs surpassed 30%. Such heteroaromatic type emitters showed wide emission spectra, therefore more attention is being paid to develop highly efficient orange&#8208;red TADF emitters along with good color purity. Herein, we reviewed the recent progress of orange&#8208;red TADF emitters based on molecular structures such as cyano benzene, heteroaromatic, naphthalimide, and boron based acceptors. Further, our insight on these acceptors has been provided by their photophysical studies and device performances. Future perspectives of orange&#8208;red TADF emitters for real practical applications are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferroelectrics in photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid development of industrialization and population brings water and air pollution and energy crisis. Solar driven catalysis is expected to relieve above issues. However, low efficiency of solar conversion limited by poor light harvesting and serious charge recombination of semiconductors and high surface reaction barriers is far from the satisfactory of industrial request. Ferroelectrics have been considered as promising photocatalysts to overcome these shortcomings. Herein, perovskite ferroelectrics such as BaTiO  3  , PbTiO  3  and LiNbO  3  , layered bismuth&#8208;based ferroelectrics like BiFeO  3  , Bi  2  WO  6  , Bi  2  MoO  6  , etc. and other ferroelectrics have been introduced, and their crystal structure, polarity source and synthetic method have been highlighted. Then, the research progress of ferroelectrics for photocatalysis has been summarized, including pollution degradation, water splitting and CO  2  reduction. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects of ferroelectric photocatalysts have been provided. The purpose of this review is not only to provide a timely summary for the application of ferroelectrics in photocatalysis, but also to present a deep insight and guideline for the future research works of ferroelectrics  .</dc:description>

         <title>Ring Opening Reactions of &#946;&#8208;Propiolactam in Superacidic Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of  &#946;  &#8208;propiolactam in the superacidic systems HF/  M  F  5  (  M  &#160;=&#160;Sb,&#160;As) led to the formation of monoprotonated 3&#8209;aminopropanoyl fluoride in the form of [C(O)F(CH  2  )  2  NH  3  ][SbF  6  ] and [C(O)F(CH  2  )  2  NH  3  ][AsF  6  ]. In presence of water traces, the diprotonated species of  &#946;  &#8208;alanine [C(OH)  2  (CH  2  )  2  NH  3  ][AsF  6  ]  2  was synthesized for the first time. All salts were characterized by low temperature infrared and Raman spectroscopy. Additionally, in case of [C(O)F(CH  2  )  2  NH  3  ][SbF  6  ] and [C(OH)  2  (CH  2  )  2  NH  3  ][AsF  6  ]  2  , single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analyses were conducted. By using SO  2  instead of HF as the solvent, the salt [C(OH)  2  (CH  2  )  2  NHSO][SbF  6  ]  2  was obtained, and a single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of this salt containing a thionylimide moiety was conducted. For the formation of these open&#8208;chain compounds, an acyl cationic species as intermediate is assumed, which is formed from  N  &#8209;protonated  &#946;  &#8208;propiolactam. Quantum chemical calculations on the B3LYP/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ level of theory, and the MP2/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ level of theory, respectively, were carried out to gain a better understanding of the formation and the structural properties of protonated  &#946;  &#8208;propiolactam.</dc:description>

         <title>Rearrangements in Scholl Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rearrangements in Scholl reaction are mostly serendipitous. The design of molecular precursors is what seems to guide the course of rearrangement. This review consolidates different classes of precursors used in Scholl reaction and their accompanying rearrangements that include aryl migration, migration followed by cyclization and skeletal rearrangements involving ring expansion, ring contraction and both, under the reaction conditions. The attempt in collating heretofore&#8208;reported examples in this review is to guide designing appropriate precursors to predictably achieve complex molecular structures or nanographenes or defect&#8208;nanographenes via rearrangement.</dc:description>

         <title>1,2,3&#8208;Tri(9&#8208;anthryl)benzene:&#160;Photophysical Properties and Solid State Intermolecular Interactions of Radially Arranged, Congested Aromatic &#960;&#8208;Planes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the Negishi coupling based synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;tri(9&#8208;anthryl)benzene derivatives, containing three radially arranged anthracenes in a &#960;&#8208;cluster. In the crystalline state of the unsubstituted derivative, intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; and CH&#8208;&#960; interactions between the anthracene units drive the formation of a two&#8208;dimensional packing structure. Owing to though&#8208;space &#960;&#8208;conjugation between anthracene units, the substances have unique electronic properties. The excited state dynamic behavior occurring between the three radially arranged anthracene moieties, such as exciton localization/delocalization, was elucidated by means of transient absorption measurements and quantum chemical calculations. Interestingly, even though the three anthracenes are closely oriented with a ca. 3.0 &#197; distances between their C&#8208;9 positions, exciton localization on two anthracene units is energetically favorable because of the flexible nature of the radially arranged aromatic rings.</dc:description>

         <title>Biodegradation of herbicides by a plant nonheme iron dioxygenase: mechanism and selectivity of substrate analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryloxyalkanoate dioxygenases are unique herbicide biodegrading nonheme iron enzymes found in plants and hence, from environmental and agricultural point of view they are important and valuable. However, they often are substrate specific and little is known on the details of the mechanism and the substrate scope. To this end, we created enzyme models and calculate the mechanism for 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenoxyacetic acid biodegradation and 2&#8208;methyl substituted analogs by density functional theory. The work shows that the substrate binding is tight and positions the aliphatic group close to the metal center to enable a chemoselective reaction mechanism to form the C  2  &#8208;hydroxy products, whereas the aromatic hydroxylation barriers are well higher in energy. Subsequently, we investigated the metabolism of  R  &#8208; and  S  &#8208;methyl substituted inhibitors and show that these do not react as efficiently as 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenoxyacetic acid substrate due to stereochemical clashes in the active site and particularly for the  R  &#8208;isomer give high rebound barriers.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Mycinamicin IV as Integral Part of a Collective Approach to Macrolide Antibiotics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The total synthesis of the 16&#8208;membered macrolide mycinamicin IV is outlined, which complements our previously disclosed, largely catalysis&#8208;based route to the aglycone. This work must also be seen in the context of our recent conquest of aldgamycin N, a related antibiotic featuring a similar core but a distinctly different functionalization pattern. Taken together, these projects prove that the underlying blueprint is integrative and hence qualifies for a collective approach to this prominent class of natural products. In both cases, the final glycosylation phase mandated close attention and was accomplished only after robust de novo syntheses of the (di)deoxy sugars of the desosamine, chalcose, mycinose and aldgarose types had been established. Systematic screening of the glycosidation promoter was also critically important for success.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trihalide salts were found to efficiently promote photochemical dediazotizing halogenations of diazonium salts. In contrast to classical Sandmeyer reactions, no metal catalysts are required to achieve high yields and outstanding selectivities for halogenation over competing hydridodediazotization. Convenient protocols are disclosed for synthetically meaningful brominations, iodinations, and chlorinations of diversely functionalized derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Indoloquinoline Ligands Favor Intercalation at Quadruplex&#8208;Duplex Interfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quadruplex&#8208;duplex (Q&#8208;D) junctions are increasingly considered promising targets for medicinal and technological applications. Here, a Q&#8208;D hybrid with a hairpin&#8208;type snapback loop coaxially stacked onto the quadruplex 3&#8217;&#8208;outer tetrad was designed and employed as a target structure for the indoloquinoline ligand SYUIQ&#8208;5. NMR spectral analysis demonstrated high&#8208;affinity binding of the ligand at the quadruplex&#8208;duplex interface with association constants determined by isothermal titration calorimetry of about 10  7  M  &#8208;1  and large exothermicities &#916;  H  &#176; of &#8208;14 kcal/mol in a 120 mM K  +  buffer at 40 &#176;C. Determination of the ligand&#8208;bound hybrid structure revealed intercalation of SYUIQ&#8208;5 between 3&#8217;&#8208;outer tetrad and the neighboring CG base pair, maximizing &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking as well as electrostatic interactions with guanine carbonyl groups in close vicinity to the positively charged protonated quinoline nitrogen of the tetracyclic indoloquinoline. Exhibiting considerable flexibility, the SYUIQ&#8208;5 sidechain resides in the duplex minor groove. Based on comparative binding studies with the non&#8208;substituted  N  5&#8208;methylated indoloquinoline cryptolepine, the sidechain is suggested to confer additional affinity and to fix the alignment of the intercalated indoloquinoline aromatic core. However, selectivity for the Q&#8208;D junction mostly relies on the geometry and charge distribution of the indoloquinoline ring system. The presented results are expected to provide valuable guidelines for the design of ligands specifically targeting Q&#8208;D interfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd(II)&#8208;mediated C&#8208;H activation for cysteine bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective bioconjugation remains a significant challenge for the synthetic chemist due to the stringent reaction conditions required by biomolecules coupled with their high degree of functionality. The current trailblazer of transition&#8208;metal mediated bioconjugation chemistry involves the use of Pd(II) complexes prepared via an oxidative addition process. Herein, the preparation of Pd(II) complexes for cysteine bioconjugation via a facile C&#8208;H activation process is reported. These complexes show bioconjugation efficiency competitive with what is seen in the current literature, with a user&#8208;friendly synthesis, common Pd(II) sources, and a more cost&#8208;effective ligand. Furthermore, these complexes need not be isolated, and still achieve high conversion efficiency and selectivity of a model peptide. These complexes also demonstrate the ability to selectively arylate a single surface cysteine residue on a model protein substrate, further demonstrating their utility.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Bonding Enhanced Self&#8208;Co&#8208;Reactant Electrogenerated Chemiluminescence for Sensitive and Selective Detection of Thioglycolic Acid in Cosmetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thioglycolic acid (TGA) is an organic compound widely used in cosmetics that cause a variety of health problems when overexposed to it. So far many attempts have been made to develop methods for TGA detection, but most of them need sophisticated instrumentations and are a little bit complicated. Therefore, a simple, cheap and sensitive detection method of TGA is highly desired. Herein, we demonstrated for the first time an Au&#8208;S bonding amplified, highly sensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensing method for TGA detection using tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) (Ru(bpy) 3  2+  ) as a luminophore and TGA as a self&#8208;co&#8208;reactant, via an anodic reaction at the Au electrode surface. Due to different molecular coordination environments of the TGA at the electrode surface, the ECL signal intensity of the developed ECL system gives much higher ECL signal in borate buffer than phosphate buffer of the same pH. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the ECL intensity has a direct relationship with the concentration of TGA in the range of 0.03 &#956;M to 300 &#956;M and a limit of detection of 0.013 &#181;M (3&#963;/ m  ). The reported ECL system has further been applied for the detection of TGA in cosmetics with acceptable recoveries.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning peptide structure and function through fluorobenzene stapling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic peptides are promising next&#8208;generation therapeutics with improved biological stability and activity. A catalyst&#8208;free stapling method for cysteine&#8208;containing peptides was developed. This enables fine&#8208;tuning of the macrocycle by using the appropriate regioisomers of fluorobenzene linkers. Stapling was performed on the unprotected linear peptide or, more conveniently, directly on&#8208;resin after peptide synthesis. NMR spectroscopy and circular dichroism studies demonstrate that the type of stapling can tune the secondary structures of the peptides. The method was applied to a set of potential agonists for melanocortin receptors, generating a library of macrocyclic potent ligands with  ortho  ,  meta  or  para  relationships between the thioethers. Their small but significant difference in potency and efficacy demonstrates how the method allows facile fine&#8208;tuning of macrocyclic peptides towards biological targets from the same linear precursor.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective para&#8208;C&#8211;H Alkynylation of Aniline Derivatives via Pd/S,O&#8208;Ligand Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a nondirected  para  &#8208;selective C&#8211;H alkynylation of aniline derivatives by a Pd/S,O&#8208;ligand&#8208;based catalyst. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions and is compatible with a variety of substituted anilines. The scalability and further derivatizations of the alkynylated products have been also demonstrated.</dc:description>
