         <title>Photochemical Activation of Aromatic Aldehydes: Synthesis of Amides, Hydroxamic Acids and Esters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A cheap, facile and metal&#8208;free photochemical protocol for the activation of aromatic aldehydes has been developed. Utilizing thioxanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one as the photocatalyst and cheap household lamps as the light source, a variety of aromatic aldehydes have been activated and subsequently converted in a one&#8208;pot reaction into amides, hydroxamic acids and esters in good to high yields. The applicability of this method was highlighted in the synthesis of Moclobemide, a drug against depression and social anxiety. Extended and detailed mechanistic studies have been conducted, in order to determine a plausible mechanism for the reaction.</dc:description>

All in the delivery: Biofunctionalized TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized in a single&#8208;step from Grape seed extract proanthocyanin polyphenols. The GSE&#8208;TiO2&#8208;NPs can be used as functionally stable antibacterial agents to combat UTIs in clinical settings.







Abstract
Biofunctionalized TiO2 nanoparticles with a size range of 18.42&#177;1.3&#8197;nm were synthesized in a single&#8208;step approach employing Grape seed extract (GSE) proanthocyanin (PAC) polyphenols. The effect of PACs rich GSE corona was examined with respect to 1)&#8197;the stability and dispersity of as&#8208;synthesized GSE&#8208;TiO2&#8208;NPs, 2)&#8197;their antiproliferative and antibiofilm efficacy, and 3)&#8197;their propensity for internalization and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in urinary tract infections (UTIs) causing Gram&#8208;negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gram&#8208;positive Staphylococcus&#8197;saprophyticus strains. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques were used to validate GSE&#8208;TiO2&#8208;NPs formation. Comparative Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectral analysis demonstrated that PACs linked functional &#8208;OH groups likely play a central role in Ti4+ reduction and nucleation to GSE&#8208;TiO2&#8208;NPs, while forming a thin, soft corona around nascent NPs to attribute significantly enhanced stability and dispersity. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) and inductively coupled plasma mass&#8208;spectroscopy (ICP&#8208;MS) analyses confirmed there was significantly (p&lt;0.05) enhanced intracellular uptake of GSE&#8208;TiO2&#8208;NPs in both Gram&#8208;negative and &#8208;positive test uropathogens as compared to bare TiO2&#8208;NPs. Correspondingly, compared to bare NPs, GSE&#8208;TiO2&#8208;NPs induced intracellular ROS formation that corresponded well with dose&#8208;dependent inhibitory patterns of cell proliferation and biofilm formation in both the tested strains. Overall, this study demonstrates that &#8208;OH rich PACs of GSE corona on biogenic TiO2&#8208;NPs maximized the functional stability, dispersity and propensity of penetration into planktonic cells and biofilm matrices. Such unique merits warrant the use of GSE&#8208;TiO2&#8208;NPs as a novel, functionally stable and efficient antibacterial nano&#8208;formulation to combat the menace of UTIs in clinical settings.

Two ways to activate CO2: Depending on the solvent, dialane [LAl&#8208;AlL] (1; L=dianion of 1,2&#8208;bis[(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imino]acenaphthene, dpp&#8208;bian) activates carbon dioxide in two different ways. In toluene, a reversible [2+4] cycloaddition gives product 2, whereas in diethyl ether the insertion of CO2 into the Al&#8722;N bond is accompanied with irreversible elimination of CO.







Abstract
The reaction of dialane [LAl&#8208;AlL] (1; L=dianion of 1,2&#8208;bis[(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imino]acenaphthene, dpp&#8208;bian) with carbon dioxide results in two different products depending on solvent. In toluene at temperatures of about 0&#8201;&#176;C, the reaction gives cycloadduct [L(CO2)Al&#8208;Al(O2C)L] (2), whereas in diethyl ether, the reaction affords oxo&#8208;bridged carbamato derivative [L(CO2)(Et2O)Al(&#956;&#8208;O)AlL] (3). The DFT and QTAIM calculations provide reasonable explanations for the reversible formation of complex&#8197;2 in the course of two subsequent (2+4) cycloaddition reactions. Consecutive transition states with low activation barriers were revealed. Also, the DFT study demonstrated a crucial effect of diethyl ether coordination to aluminium on the reaction of dialane 1 with CO2. The optimized structures of key intermediates were obtained for the reactions in the presence of Et2O; calculated thermodynamic parameters unambiguously testify the irreversible formation of the product&#8197;3.

         <title>Exploratory N&#8208;Protecting Group Manipulation for the Total Synthesis of Zwitterionic Shigella sonnei Oligosaccharides</title>

Fine&#8208;tuned N&#8208;protecting group selection and manipulation to control the 1C4&#8652;2SO&#8652;4C1 conformational equilibrium of l&#8208;AltpNAcA within a disaccharide building block and to accomplish high yielding iterative glycosylation and full deprotection. The synthesis of di&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, hexa&#8208; and octasaccharide segments from the S sonnei zwitterionic polysaccharides was achieved.







Abstract
Shigella sonnei surface polysaccharides are well&#8208;established protective antigens against this major cause of diarrhoeal disease. They also qualify as unique zwitterionic polysaccharides (ZPSs) featuring a disaccharide repeating unit made of two 1,2&#8208;trans linked rare aminodeoxy sugars, a 2&#8208;acetamido&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;l&#8208;altruronic acid (l&#8208;AltpNAcA) and a 2&#8208;acetamido&#8208;4&#8208;amino&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trideoxy&#8208;d&#8208;galactopyranose (AAT). Herein, the stereoselective synthesis of S. sonnei oligosaccharides comprising two, three and four repeating units is reported for the first time. Several sets of up to seven protecting groups were explored, shedding light on the singular conformational behavior of protected altrosamine and altruronic residues. A disaccharide building block equipped with three distinct N&#8208;protecting groups and featuring the uronate moiety already in place was designed to accomplish the iterative high yielding glycosylation at the axial 4&#8208;OH of the altruronate component and achieve the challenging full deprotection step. Key to the successful route was the use of a diacetyl strategy whereby the N&#8208;acetamido group of the l&#8208;AltpNAcA is masked in the form of an imide.

A disaccharide building block equipped with three distinct &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;protecting groups and featuring the uronate moiety already in place was designed to accomplish the iterative high yielding glycosylation at the axial 4&#8208;OH of the altruronate component and achieve the challenging full deprotection step. Key to the successful route was the use of a diacetyl strategy whereby the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;acetamido group of the &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&#8208;Alt&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;NAcA is masked in the form of an imide.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Photo&#8208;Oxidation&#8208;Controlled Surface Pattern with Responsive Wrinkled Topography and Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 18, Page 5810-5816, March 26, 2021. </description>

Data storage in wrinkles: A facile and robust strategy is reported for the fabrication of dynamic patterns with responsive fluorescence and wrinkled topography based on the photo&#8208;oxidation of 2&#8208;(4&#8208;dietheylaminophenyl)&#8208;4,5&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl) imidazole. In this strategy, the otherwise undesirable process of photo&#8208;oxidation is successfully applied to produce a positive effect in bilayer systems of wrinkling, which shows potential for application in multi&#8208;code information storage.







Abstract
Wrinkles and photo&#8208;oxidation reactions are widely found in soft materials, which are intimately associated with the failure of materials and structures. It is expected that the photo&#8208;oxidation process could also have a positive effect on the material and its surface. Here, we report the photo&#8208;oxidation of 2&#8208;(4&#8208;dietheylaminophenyl)&#8208;4,5&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl) imidazole (DEA&#8208;TAI) into a wrinkled bilayer system to control surface wrinkle and fluorescent patterns, in which a supramolecular polymer network composed of carboxylic acid&#8208;containing copolymer (PS&#8208;BA&#8208;AA; PS=poly(styrene), BA=butyl acrylate; AA=acrylic acid) and DEA&#8208;TAI were used as the skin layer. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation can induce photo&#8208;oxidation of the imidazole ring of DEA&#8208;TAI to weaken the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between PS&#8208;BA&#8208;AA and DEA&#8208;TAI, resulting in the release of stress in the bilayer system. The wrinkled morphology and fluorescence of the surface can be simultaneously regulated by photo&#8208;oxidation of DEA&#8208;TAI under UV light, and the resulting wrinkles are extremely sensitive to the pH value, which can be quickly and reversibly erased by NH3 gas. Smart surfaces with specific hierarchical wrinkles and fluorescence can be achieved by selective irradiation with photomasks, which may find potential applications in smart displays and multi&#8208;code information storage.

         <title>Influence of Pore Structure and Metal&#8208;Node Geometry on the Polymerization of Ethylene over Cr&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 18, Page 5769-5781, March 26, 2021. </description>

Multiple active sites: MIL&#8208;101(Cr)&#8208;NDC, MIL&#8208;53(Cr) and HKUST&#8208;1(Cr) were tested for ethylene polymerization and found to produce different polyethylene (PE) products and PE morphologies. Analysis of the PE revealed that multiple active sites exist, indicating that the active phase cannot be considered a single&#8208;site catalyst. An array of spectroscopic techniques was used to investigate active site formation for the aforementioned metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs).







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have received increasing interest as solid single&#8208;site catalysts, owing to their tunable pore architecture and metal node geometry. The ability to exploit these modulators makes them prominent candidates for producing polyethylene (PE) materials with narrow dispersity index (&#208;) values. Here a study is presented in which the ethylene polymerization properties, with Et2AlCl as activator, of three renowned Cr&#8208;based MOFs, MIL&#8208;101(Cr)&#8208;NDC (NDC=2,6&#8208;dicarboxynapthalene), MIL&#8208;53(Cr) and HKUST&#8208;1(Cr), are systematically investigated. Ethylene polymerization reactions revealed varying catalytic activities, with MIL&#8208;101(Cr)&#8208;NDC and MIL&#8208;53(Cr) being significantly more active than HKUST&#8208;1(Cr). Analysis of the PE products revealed large &#208; values, demonstrating that polymerization occurs over a multitude of active Cr centers rather than a singular type of Cr site. Spectroscopic experiments, in the form of powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (pXRD), UV/Vis&#8208;NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and CO probe molecule Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy corroborated these findings, indicating that indeed for each MOF unique active sites are generated, however without alteration of the original oxidation state. Furthermore, the pXRD experiments indicated that one major prerequisite for catalytic activity was the degree of MOF activation by the Et2AlCl co&#8208;catalyst, with the more active materials portraying a larger degree of activation.

         <title>Isolation and Structural Determination of a Hexacoordinated Antimony(V) Dication</title>

         <dc:description>
How unusual! A rare hexacoordinated dication of SbV has been synthesized (see scheme). This [12&#8211;Sb&#8211;6]2+ species exhibits remarkable stability due to the synergistic kinetic and thermodynamic stabilization provided by donor&#8211;acceptor interactions with its 2&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)phenyl ligands. This dicationic species preferentially adopts a meridional form both in solution and in the solid state.







Abstract
The hexacoordinated antimony(V) dication [(ppy)3Sb]2+ ([1]2+; ppy=2&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)phenyl), stabilized by three intramolecular donor&#8211;acceptor interactions, has been isolated as its hexachloroantimonate salt [1][SbCl6]2, prepared by the oxidative addition of chlorine to the neutral stibine [(ppy)3Sb] (1), followed by the abstraction of chloride. Air&#8208;stable [1][SbCl6]2 exhibits remarkable thermal stability and the three ppy ligands on the antimony atom are shown to be magnetically inequivalent in the 1H and 13C&#8197;NMR spectra. A hexacoordinated, meridional octahedral bonding geometry has been determined for [1][SbCl6]2 by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Theoretical calculations were performed to investigate why the meridional form was generated preferentially over the facial form. In addition, the dynamics of the ppy ligands were investigated by variable&#8208;temperature 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. The potential to generate dications by using a single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer reagent has also been investigated. The dication [1]2+ is the first [12&#8211;Sb&#8211;6]2+ chemical species to have been structurally determined.

         <title>Do Sulfonamides Interact with Aromatic Rings?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 18, Page 5721-5729, March 26, 2021. </description>

Through space! It is demonstrated, by using experimental and quantum chemical techniques, that aromatic rings can stabilize sulfonamides via through&#8208;space NH&#8211;&#960; interactions. These findings have implications in the rational drug design targeting electron&#8208;rich aromatic rings in proteins.







Abstract
Aromatic rings form energetically favorable interactions with many polar groups in chemical and biological systems. Recent molecular studies have shown that sulfonamides can chelate metal ions and form hydrogen bonds, however, it is presently not established whether the polar sulfonamide functionality also interacts with aromatic rings. Here, synthetic, spectroscopic, structural, and quantum chemical analyses on 2,6&#8208;diarylbenzenesulfonamides are reported, in which two flanking aromatic rings are positioned close to the central sulfonamide moiety. Fine&#8208;tuning the aromatic character by substituents on the flanking rings leads to linear trends in acidity and proton affinity of sulfonamides. This physical&#8208;organic chemistry study demonstrates that aromatic rings have a capacity to stabilize sulfonamides via through&#8208;space NH&#8211;&#960; interactions. These results have implications in rational drug design targeting electron&#8208;rich aromatic rings in proteins.

Fine&#8208;tuning the aromatic character by substituents on the flanking rings leads to linear trends in acidity and proton affinity of sulfonamides. This physical&#8208;organic chemistry study demonstrates that aromatic rings have a capacity to stabilize sulfonamides via through&#8208;space NH&#8211;&#960; interactions. These results have implications in rational drug design targeting electron&#8208;rich aromatic rings in proteins.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Mechanistic Investigation on Chemiluminescent Formaldehyde Probes</title>

Formaldehyde detection: A first&#8208;generation pair of chemiluminescent formaldehyde (FA) probes (CFAP540 and CFAP700) was reported recently. The mechanism and detailed process of CFAP chemiluminescence (CL) remain largely unknown. Thus, (time&#8208;dependent) density functional theory calculations are performed on the entire reaction process of CFAP540 with FA to produce CL. A scheme to develop bright and tunable CFAPs is proposed.







Abstract
A first&#8208;generation pair of chemiluminescent formaldehyde (FA) probes (CFAP540 and CFAP700) was reported recently. CFAP540 and CFAP700, with high selectivity and sensitivity to FA, are, respectively, suitable in cell and in vivo. Experimentalists have confirmed that both probes utilize a general 2&#8208;aza&#8208;Cope FA&#8208;reactive trigger and a chemiluminogenic phenoxydioxetane scaffold. The mechanism and detailed process of CFAP chemiluminescence (CL) remain largely unknown. In the present paper, (time&#8208;dependent) density functional theory calculations are performed on the entire reaction process of CFAP540 with FA to produce CL. The calculations elucidated the CL&#8208;producing process: FA initiates the decomposition of CFAP540 by dehydration condensation, and a phenoxy 1,2&#8208;dioxetane is formed through a series of reactions of aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement, hydrolysis of imine, and &#946;&#8208;elimination of alkoxyl group. Afterwards, the produced phenoxy 1,2&#8208;dioxetane decomposes to produce the m&#8208;oxybenzoate derivative in the first singlet state (S1) via two crossings between potential energy surfaces of the ground state (S0) and S1 state. This m&#8208;oxybenzoate derivative was assigned as the light emitter of the CFAP540 CL. The CL&#8208;producing process and assignment of the light emitter of CFAP700 CL are similar with the corresponding ones of CFAP540. By analyzing the D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A architecture of the light emitters of CFAP540 and CFAP700, a series of CFAPs is theoretically designed and a scheme to modulate their CL from visible to near&#8208;infrared region is proposed by adjusting the length and structure of the &#960;&#8208;bridge.

         <title>Enthalpically and Entropically Favorable Self&#8208;Assembly: Synthesis of C4h&#8208;Symmetric Tetraazatetrathia[8]circulenes by Regioselective Introduction of Pyridine Rings</title>

Doubly favored self&#8208;assembly: The synthesis and properties of tetraazatetrathia[8]circulenes are disclosed. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis demonstrated that the tetraazatetrathia[8]circulenes form face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacked dimers owing to the circularly arranged dipole moments. Formation of self&#8208;assemblies of tetraazatetrathia[8]circulenes is favored by both enthalpic and entropic factors. The unique behavior is due to the presence of sp2&#8208;hybridized nitrogen atoms.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules in solution generally occurs owing to either an enthalpic or an entropic gain; however, designing &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems that simultaneously exhibit enthalpically and entropically favorable self&#8208;assembly behavior is challenging. Herein, the self&#8208;assembly behavior of tetraazatetrathia[8]circulenes is disclosed, which is driven by both enthalpy and entropy. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis demonstrated that molecules of these tetraazatetrathia[8]circulenes form face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacked dimers with a 1D columnar structure owing to the circularly arranged dipole moments. Importantly, concentration&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent 1H&#8197;NMR spectra revealed that the formation of self&#8208;assemblies of tetraazatetrathia[8]circulenes in chloroform and methanol is favored by both enthalpic and entropic factors. The unique association behavior is due to the presence of sp2&#8208;hybridized nitrogen atoms, which weakly coordinate to the hydrogen atoms of these solvents and reduce the &#960;&#8208;electron density of the circulene cores.

A transition metal&#8208;free N&#8208;arylation of amino esters is reported, where the use of unsymmetric aryl(anisyl) iodonium salts is key to obtain high yields. The scope includes arylation with electron deficient, electron rich, and sterically hindered aryl groups. Various functional groups are tolerated, and no racemization is generally observed.







Abstract
A transition metal&#8208;free approach for the N&#8208;arylation of amino acid derivatives has been developed. Key to this method is the use of unsymmetric diaryliodonium salts with anisyl ligands, which proved important to obtain high chemoselectivity and yields. The scope includes the transfer of both electron deficient, electron rich and sterically hindered aryl groups with a variety of different functional groups. Furthermore, a cyclic diaryliodonium salt was successfully employed in the arylation. The N&#8208;arylated products were obtained with retained enantiomeric excess.

Abstract
Nanoscale composites for high&#8208;performance electrodes employed in flexible, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state supercapacitors are being developed. A series of binder&#8208;free composites, each consisting of a transition bimetal oxide, a metal oxide, and a metal nitride grown on N&#8208;doped reduced graphene oxide (rGO)&#8208;wrapped nickel foam are obtained by using a universal strategy. Three different transition metals, Co, Mo, and Fe, are separately compounded with nickel ions, which originate from the nickel foam, to form three composites, NiCoO2@Co3O4@Co2N, NiMoO4@MoO3@Mo2N, and NiFe2O4@Fe3O4@Fe2N, respectively. These as&#8208;prepared active materials have similar regular variation patterns in their properties, including better conductivity and battery&#8208;mimicking pseudocapacitance, which result in their high whole&#8208;electrode capacitance performance [2598.3&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 (39.85&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;2), 3472.6&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 (41.43&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and 1907.5&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 (3.41&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;2) for the composites incorporating Co, Mo, and Fe, respectively]. The as&#8208;assembled flexible, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state NiCoO2@Co3O4@Co2N//KOH/PVA//NiCoO2@Co3O4@Co2N device can be easily bent and exhibits high energy density and power density of 92.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and 1670.4&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1, respectively. The universality of this design strategy could allow it to be employed in producing hybrid materials for high&#8208;performance energy&#8208;storage devices.

Three different transition metals, Co, Mo, and Fe, are separately compounded with nickel ions, which originate from the nickel foam, to form three composites, NiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N, NiMoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N, and NiFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N, respectively. These as&#8208;prepared active materials have similar regular variation patterns in their properties, including better conductivity and battery&#8208;mimicking pseudocapacitance, which result in their high whole&#8208;electrode capacitance performance [2598.3&#8197;F&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (39.85&#8197;F&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), 3472.6&#8197;F&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (41.43&#8197;F&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and 1907.5&#8197;F&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (3.41&#8197;F&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for the composites incorporating Co, Mo, and Fe, respectively]. The as&#8208;assembled flexible, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state NiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N//KOH/PVA//NiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N device can be easily bent and exhibits high energy density and power density of 92.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 1670.4&#8197;W&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. The universality of this design strategy could allow it to be employed in producing hybrid materials for high&#8208;performance energy&#8208;storage devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Filling the Charge&#8211;Discharge Voltage Gap in Flexible Hybrid Zinc&#8208;Based Batteries by Utilizing a Pseudocapacitive Material</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 18, Page 5796-5802, March 26, 2021. </description>

Pretender to fill the gap: A bottleneck for metal&#8211;air batteries is their charge&#8211;discharge voltage gap (resulting in low cell efficiency), which is caused by the sluggish oxygen evolution/reduction reactions (OER/ORR) at the air electrodes. Honeycomb&#8208;like MnCo2O4.5 spheres on nickel foam provides pseudocapacitance that can fill this potential gap of OER and ORR. A zinc&#8211;air battery utilizing this material showed promising performance.







Abstract
The high charge&#8211;discharge voltage gap is one of the main bottlenecks of zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) because of the kinetically sluggish oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER) on the oxygen electrode side. Thus, an efficient bifunctional catalyst for ORR and OER is highly desired. Herein, honeycomb&#8208;like MnCo2O4.5 spheres were used as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst. It was demonstrated that both ORR and OER catalytic activity are promoted by MnIV&#8208;induced oxygen vacancy defects and multiple active sites. Importantly, the multivalent ions present in the material and its defect structure endow stable pseudocapacitance within the inactive region of ORR and OER; as a result, a low charge&#8211;discharge voltage gap (0.43&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) was achieved when it was employed in a flexible hybrid Zn&#8208;based battery. This mechanism provides unprecedented and valuable insights for the development of next&#8208;generation metal&#8211;air batteries.

         <title>Selective Cross&#8208;Coupling of Unsaturated Substrates on AlI</title>

AlI compound NacNacAl mediates chemoselective cross&#8208;coupling of carbonyl substrates (non&#8208;enolizable ketones, imines, and esters) with pyridine.







Abstract
The AlI compound NacNacAl (1, NacNac = [ArNC(Me)CHC(Me)NAr]&#8722;, Ar = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) serves as a template for the chemoselective coupling between carbonyls (benzophenone, fenchone, isophorone, p&#8208;tolyl benzoate, N,N&#8208;dimethylbenzamide, (1&#8208;phenylethylidene)aniline) and pyridine. With the CH&#8208;acidic ketone (1R)&#8208;(+) camphor, the reaction affords a hydrido alkoxide compound of Al, formed as the result of enolization, whereas an enolizable imine, (1&#8208;phenylethylidene)aniline, and the bulky ketone isophorone, still chemoselectively couple with pyridine. In contrast, reaction with the ester p&#8208;tolyl benzoate results in cleavage of the ester bond together with replacement of the alkoxy group by a hydrogen atom of the pyridine moiety. This study demonstrates that for carbonyl substrates featuring phenyl substituents, the reaction proceeds via intermediate formation of &#951;2(C,X)&#8208;coordinated (X = O, N) carbonyl adducts, whereas the reaction of 1 with (R)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;fenchone in the absence of pyridine leads to CH activation in the pendant isopropyl group of the Ar substituent of the NacNac ligand.

Dipnictene&#8208;based metalloradicals: The metalloradicals (3&#8208;E).+ (E=P or As) are accessible as crystalline violet solids by 1e oxidation of divinyldipnictene Fe0 complexes 2E. Further 1e oxidation of (3&#8208;E).+ leads to unprecedented &#951;3&#8208;EECvinyl to &#951;3&#8208;ECvinylCPh coordination shuttling resulting in the dications (4&#8208;E)2+.







Abstract
Metalloradicals are key species in synthesis, catalysis, and bioinorganic chemistry. Herein, two iron radical cation complexes (3&#8208;E)GaCl4 [(3&#8208;E).+ = [{(IPr)C(Ph)E}2Fe(CO)3].+, E = P or As; IPr = C{(NDipp)CH}2, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3] are reported as crystalline solids. Treatment of the divinyldipnictenes {(IPr)C(Ph)E}2 (1&#8208;E) with Fe2(CO)9 affords [{(IPr)C(Ph)E}2Fe(CO)3] (2&#8208;E), in which 1&#8208;E binds to the Fe atom in an allylic (&#951;3&#8208;EECvinyl) fashion and functions as a 4e donor ligand. Complexes 2&#8208;E undergo 1e oxidation with GaCl3 to yield (3&#8208;E)GaCl4. Spin density analysis revealed that the unpaired electron in (3&#8208;E).+ is mainly located on the Fe (52&#8211;64&#8201;%) and vinylic C (30&#8211;36&#8201;%) atoms. Further 1e oxidation of (3&#8208;E)GaCl4 leads to unprecedented &#951;3&#8208;EECvinyl to &#951;3&#8208;ECvinylCPh coordination shuttling to form the dications (4&#8208;E)(GaCl4)2.

Pd&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H alkoxycarbonylation of phenylalanine derivatives and other amines featuring picolinamide as the directing group (DG) is described. Notably, the easy cleavage of the DG results in the straightforward assembly of isoindolinone compounds. Density Functional Theory calculations support a PdII/PdIV catalytic cycle.







Abstract
The site&#8208;selective functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds within a complex molecule remains a challenging task of capital synthetic importance. Herein, an unprecedented Pd&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H alkoxycarbonylation of phenylalanine derivatives and other amines featuring picolinamide as the directing group (DG) is reported. This oxidative coupling is distinguished by its scalability, operational simplicity, and avoids the use of toxic carbon monoxide as the C1 source. Remarkably, the easy cleavage of the DG enables the efficient assembly of isoindolinone compounds. Density Functional Theory calculations support a PdII/PdIV catalytic cycle.

         <title>Paraoxonase Mimic by a Nanoreactor Aggregate Containing Benzimidazolium Calix and l&#8208;Histidine: Demonstration of the Acetylcholine Esterase Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 18, Page 5737-5744, March 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
To reduce pesticide poisoning and produce antidotes for chemical warfare agents, it is desirable to develop highly efficient catalysts that can rapidly hydrolyze organophosphates (OPs) and detoxify them. Thus, a nanoreactor made from benzimidazole&#8208;based cationic calix and l&#8208;His was developed for the hydrolysis of OPs.







Abstract
An anion&#8208;mediated preorganization approach was used to design and synthesize the benzimidazolium&#8208;based calix compound R1&#8901;2&#8201;ClO4&#8722;. X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis revealed that the hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between the benzimidazolium cations and N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) helped R1&#8901;2&#8201;ClO4&#8722; encapsulate DMF molecule(s). A nanoreactor, with R1&#8901;2&#8201;ClO4&#8722; and l&#8208;histidine (l&#8208;His) as the components, was fabricated by using a neutralization method. The nanoreactor could detoxify paraoxon in 30&#8197;min. l&#8208;His played a vital role in this process. Paraoxonase is a well&#8208;known enzyme used for pesticide degradation. The Ellman's reagent was used to determine the percentage inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the presence of the nanoreactor. The results indicated that the nanoreactor inhibited AChE inhibition.

         <title>Well&#8208;Defined, Versatile and Recyclable Half&#8208;Sandwich Nickelacarborane Catalyst for Selective Carbene&#8208;Transfer Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 18, Page 5754-5760, March 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The readily accessible metal nickel(II) species with a dicarbollide ligand has been introduced as catalyst. The advantages of nickelacarborane as a catalyst for carbene transfer reactions include: 1)&#8197;air&#8208;stable, versatile, well&#8208;defined, recyclable (at least 5 runs), 2)&#8197;low catalyst loading, mild conditions, 3)&#8197;7 types of reactions in good yield (up to 99&#8201;% yield) and selectivity, including diastereoselective cyclopropanation, epoxidation (d.r. &gt; 20:1), chemoselective or site&#8208;selective X&#8722;H insertion (X = C, N, O, S, Si), particularly for the unprotected substrates; 4)&#8197;the uncommon mechanism of nickel(II) acceptor&#8208;containing carbene intermediates.







Abstract
Catalytic carbene&#8208;transfer reactions constitute a class of highly useful transformations in organic synthesis. Although catalysts based on a range of transition&#8208;metals have been reported, the readily accessible nickel(II)&#8208;based complexes have been rarely used. Herein, an air&#8208;stable nickel(II)&#8208;carborane complex is reported as a well&#8208;defined, versatile and recyclable catalyst for selective carbene transfer reactions with low catalyst loading under mild conditions. This catalyst is effective for several types of reactions including diastereoselective cyclopropanation, epoxidation, selective X&#8722;H insertions (X = C, N, O, S, Si), particularly for the unprotected substrates. This represents a rare example of carborane ligands in base metal catalysis.

         <title>How Oriented External Electric Fields Modulate Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 18, Page 5683-5693, March 26, 2021. </description>

It's electrifying! Kohn&#8211;Sham molecular orbital theory is employed for the first time to rationalize how a judiciously directed oriented external electric field can steer the reactivity and selectivity of a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. These results provide a toolbox for the design of novel electric&#8208;field&#8208;catalyzed organic reactions.







Abstract
A judiciously oriented external electric field (OEEF) can catalyze a wide range of reactions and can even induce endo/exo stereoselectivity of cycloaddition reactions. The Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride is studied by using quantitative activation strain and Kohn&#8211;Sham molecular orbital theory to pinpoint the origin of these catalytic and stereoselective effects. Our quantitative model reveals that an OEEF along the reaction axis induces an enhanced electrostatic and orbital interaction between the reactants, which in turn lowers the reaction barrier. The stronger electrostatic interaction originates from an increased electron density difference between the reactants at the reactive center, and the enhanced orbital interaction arises from the promoted normal electron demand donor&#8211;acceptor interaction driven by the OEEF. An OEEF perpendicular to the plane of the reaction axis solely stabilizes the exo pathway of this reaction, whereas the endo pathway remains unaltered and efficiently steers the endo/exo stereoselectivity. The influence of the OEEF on the inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction is also investigated; unexpectedly, it inhibits the reaction, as the electric field now suppresses the critical inverse electron demand donor&#8211;acceptor interaction.

         <title>Unravelling Structural Mysteries of Simple Organozinc Alkoxides</title>

Ladder to the roof: The synthesis and structural characterization of two unprecedented zinc alkoxides, a roof&#8208;like trimer [(tBuZn)3(&#956;&#8208;OC(H)Ph2)2(&#956;3&#8208;OC(H)Ph2)] and a ladder&#8208;type tetramer [(PhZn)4(&#956;&#8208;OC(H)Ph2)2(&#956;3&#8208;OC(H)Ph2)2] is described. The solution behavior of the new RZnOR&#8217; alkoxides was also investigated by using 1H&#8197;NMR and DOSY spectroscopy, which revealed the presence of multiple aggregate states involved in the Schlenk&#8208;type equilibria.







Abstract
Simple RZnOR&#8217; alkoxides are among the first known organozinc compounds, and widespread interest in their multifaced chemistry has been driven by their fundamental significance and potential applications including various catalytic reactions. Nevertheless, their chemistry in solution and in the solid state remains both relatively poorly understood and a subject of constant debate. Herein, the synthesis and structural characterization of long&#8208;sought structural forms, a roof&#8208;like trimer [(tBuZn)3(&#956;&#8208;OC(H)Ph2)2(&#956;3&#8208;OC(H)Ph2)] and a ladder&#8208;type tetramer [(PhZn)4(&#956;&#8208;OC(H)Ph2)2(&#956;3&#8208;OC(H)Ph2)2], incorporating diphenylmethanolate as a model alkoxide ligand, are reported. Both novel aggregates are robust in the solid state and resistant towards mechanical force. By using 1H&#8197;NMR and diffusion&#8208;order spectroscopy, it is demonstrated that new RZnOR&#8217; alkoxides are kinetically labile in solution and readily undergo ligand scrambling, such as in the case of Schlenk equilibrium. The elucidated key structural issues, which have remained undiscovered for decades, significantly advance the chemistry of RZnOR&#8217; alkoxides and should support the rational design of zinc alkoxide&#8208;based applications.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ladder to the roof&lt;/b&gt;: The synthesis and structural characterization of two unprecedented zinc alkoxides, a roof&#8208;like trimer [(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuZn)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&#8208;OC(H)Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;OC(H)Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)] and a ladder&#8208;type tetramer [(PhZn)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&#8208;OC(H)Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;OC(H)Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] is described. The solution behavior of the new RZnOR&#8217; alkoxides was also investigated by using &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR and DOSY spectroscopy, which revealed the presence of multiple aggregate states involved in the Schlenk&#8208;type equilibria.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple RZnOR&#8217; alkoxides are among the first known organozinc compounds, and widespread interest in their multifaced chemistry has been driven by their fundamental significance and potential applications including various catalytic reactions. Nevertheless, their chemistry in solution and in the solid state remains both relatively poorly understood and a subject of constant debate. Herein, the synthesis and structural characterization of long&#8208;sought structural forms, a roof&#8208;like trimer [(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuZn)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&#8208;OC(H)Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;OC(H)Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)] and a ladder&#8208;type tetramer [(PhZn)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&#8208;OC(H)Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;OC(H)Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], incorporating diphenylmethanolate as a model alkoxide ligand, are reported.

The discovery and development of approaches toward the synthesis of cannabidiol (CBD), which has an increasing meaning as a medicine, have arisen from the successful extraction of Cannabis plants for cannabinoid fermentation in brewer's yeast. To understand different contributions to the design and enhancement of the synthesis of CBD and its key intermediates, a detailed analysis of the history behind cannabinoid compounds and their optimization is given in the Review by R.O.M.A. de&#8197;Souza et&#8197;al. on page 5577.

         <title>Frontispiece: Boron&#8211;Ligand Cooperation: The Concept and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 18, March 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron&#8211;ligand cooperation describes a specific mode of action by which certain metal&#8208;free systems activate chemical bonds. In this process, a covalently bound substituent at the boron is actively involved in the bond activation process and changes to a datively bound ligand in the course of the bond activation. The evolution of the term boron&#8211;ligand cooperation as well as examples of bond activation by boron&#8211;ligand cooperation are discussed in the Minireview by M. Hasenbeck and U. Gellrich on page 5615.

External electric fields can be used to control the reactivity and selectivity of chemical reactions. Using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum chemical computations, this work provides a desperately needed causal model to explain how judiciously oriented external electric fields catalyze and steer the stereoselectivity of the Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. These results provide a complete framework for the design of novel electric field catalyzed organic reactions. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T.&#8197;A. Hamlin, F.&#8197;M. Bickelhaupt, et&#8197;al. on page 5683.

Ladies and gentlemen! Unique structural motifs of simple RZnOR&#8217; alkoxides, a roof&#8208;like trimer and a ladder&#8208;type tetramer, are presented to the broad audience of chemists. Moreover, we show that when our &#8242;chemical performance&#8242; is undertaken in solution, organozinc alkoxides undergo Schlenk&#8208;type ligand redistribution processes, providing the trinuclear spiro&#8208;type compounds. The announced results thus make sure that this long&#8208;standing organometallic show is continuously going on. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J. Lewi&#324;ski et&#8197;al. on page 5666.

Fujin (the wind god) and Raijin (the thunder god) hold each other's hands: The cover image depicts the collaboration of enthalpy and entropy. This work reports the synthesis of tetraazatetrathia[8]circulenes, which undergo unique self&#8208;assembly. The self&#8208;assembly in chloroform and methanol is favored by both enthalpic and entropic factors. The unique association behavior is due to the presence of pyridinic nitrogen atoms, which weakly coordinate to the hydrogen atoms of these solvents and reduce the &#960;&#8208;electron density of the circulene cores. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Y. Miyake et&#8197;al. on page 5675.

The discovery of new chemical species often reveals novel bonding modes, whose further development represents an urgent task on the interface between fundamental chemistry and materials science. This work reports the synthesis of a hexacoordinated antimony&#8208;centered dication [(ppy)3Sb]2+ and the determination of its solid&#8208;state structure. The picture illustrates that [(ppy)3Sb]2+ is unearthed from crystals of &#8216;stibnite&#8217;, which is a representative naturally occurring antimony ore. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M.&#8197;Sakabe and S.&#8197;Sato on page 5658.

Plant potential: Demand for cannabidiol (CBD) has increased drastically in the recent years, so highly pure cannabinoids and its intermediates are an emerging market for use as an antiepileptic product. Despite numerous studies describing the isolation and purification of CBD from plant material, its production is still limited. A detailed analysis of the history behind cannabinoid compounds and their optimization is provided.







Abstract
The current state of evidence and recommendations for cannabidiol (CBD) and its health effects change the legal landscape and aim to destigmatize its phytotherapeutic research. Recently, some countries have included CBD as an antiepileptic product for compassionate use in children with refractory epilepsy. The growing demand for CBD has led to the need for high&#8208;purity cannabinoids on the emerging market. The discovery and development of approaches toward CBD synthesis have arisen from the successful extraction of Cannabis plants for cannabinoid fermentation in brewer's yeast. To understand different contributions to the design and enhancement of the synthesis of CBD and its key intermediates, a detailed analysis of the history behind cannabinoid compounds and their optimization is provided herein.

         <title>Boron&#8211;Ligand Cooperation: The Concept and Applications</title>

B for cooperation: The term boron&#8211;ligand cooperation (BLC) describes a specific mode of action by which distinctive intramolecular borane&#8208;based frustrated Lewis Pairs (FLPs) activate chemical bonds. The central aspect of this concept is that the substituent at the borane that is involved in the bond activation becomes a datively bound ligand upon bond activation. The reactivity of systems that operate via BLC can complement those of classic intramolecular FLPs.







Abstract
The term boron&#8211;ligand cooperation was introduced to describe a specific mode of action by which certain metal&#8208;free systems activate chemical bonds. The main characteristic of this mode of action is that one covalently bound substituent at the boron is actively involved in the bond activation process and changes to a datively bound ligand in the course of the bond activation. Within this review, how the term boron&#8211;ligand cooperation evolved is reflected on and examples of bond activation by boron&#8211;ligand cooperation are discussed. It is furthermore shown that systems that operate via boron&#8211;ligand cooperation can complement the reactivity of classic intramolecular frustrated Lewis pairs and applications of this new concept for metal&#8208;free catalysis are summarized.

         <dc:description>
Don't be blue: A new water&#8208;stable cationic metal&#8211;organic framework material based on aggregation&#8208;induced emission ligands and attainable silver sites, ZJU&#8208;X8, is constructed to detect TcO4&#8722; with an obvious spectroscopic change from brilliant blue to flavovirens. This uncommon fluorescent recognition mechanism is well elucidated by batch sorption experiments and DFT calculations.

As one of most problematic radionuclides, technetium&#8208;99, mainly in the form of anionic pertechnetate (TcO4&#8722;), exhibits high environmental mobility, long half&#8208;life, and radioactive hazard. Due to low charge density and high hydrophobicity for this tetrahedral anion, it is extremely difficult to recognize it in water. Seeking efficient and selective recognition method for TcO4&#8722; is still a big challenge. Herein, a new water&#8208;stable cationic metal&#8208;organic framework (ZJU&#8208;X8) was reported, bearing tetraphenylethylene pyrimidine&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) ligands and attainable silver sites for TcO4&#8722; detection. ZJU&#8208;X8 underwent an obvious spectroscopic change from brilliant blue to flavovirens and exhibited splendid selectivity towards TcO4&#8722;. This uncommon fluorescent recognition mechanism was well elucidated by batch sorption experiments and DFT calculations. It was found that only TcO4&#8722; could enter into the body of ZJU&#8208;X8 through anion exchange whereas other competing anions were excluded outside. Subsequently, after interaction between TcO4&#8722; and silver ions, the electron polarizations from pyrimidine rings to Ag+ cations significantly lowered the energy level of the &#960;* orbital and thus reduced the &#960;&#8211;&#960;* energy gap, resulting in a red&#8208;shift in the fluorescent spectra.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Silylation of Csp&#8722;H by Silacyclobutanes</title>

         <dc:description>
Alkylsilanes are obtained via direct Rh&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular Csp&#8722;H silylation by silacyclobutanes under mild reaction conditions. The reaction give rise to a wide scope of alkylsilanes with high efficiency and good functional group tolerance. The steric and/or electronic properties play an important role in dictating the reactivity.







Abstract
The signature reactivity of silacyclobutane (SCB) is their cycloaddition reactions with various &#960; bonds. Recently, the first cases were disclosed where SCBs reacted with both Csp2&#8722;H and Csp3&#8722;H &#963; bonds in an intramolecular fashion. Herein, it is reported that SCB is also an efficient reagent for Csp&#8722;H bond silylation. Thus, rhodium&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular reactions between SCBs and terminal alkynes produced a series of symmetrical and unsymmetrical tetraorganosilicons bearing a Csp&#8722;Si functionality. Preliminary studies suggested that the reaction did not involve a cycloaddition pathway, but instead a direct activation of Csp&#8722;H bonds.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrogenative Carbonylation of Amines to Oxalamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 18, Page 5642-5647, March 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example on oxidative carbonylation of amines to oxalamides driven by visible light with the release of hydrogen gas has been developed. The new approach uses a simple robust Pd complex, which can even be partially recycled. A mechanistic reason is provided and supported by control experiments and EPR studies, showing that PdI formed and Pd0 was the active species. Both nitrogen&#8208; and the intermediate acyl radical were detected.







Abstract
The palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative carbonylation of amines toward the synthesis of oxalamides has been established around 30&#8197;years ago and it usually needs the presence of (over)stoichiometric amounts of oxidant. In this work, the first transformation of this type in which the oxidant was replaced by visible light is described. The new approach uses a simple robust Pd complex, which can even be partially recycled. A mechanistic reason is provided and supported by control experiments and EPR studies, showing that PdI was formed and Pd0 was the active species. Both nitrogen&#8208; and the intermediate acyl radical can be detected. Moreover, the formation of hydrogen was confirmed by gas GC.

         <title>Rhodium(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Three&#8208;Component [4+2+1] Cycloaddition of Two Vinylallenes and CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 18, Page 5638-5641, March 26, 2021. </description>

Three for one: A new three&#8208;component intermolecular [4+2+1] cycloaddition of two vinylallenes and CO is developed for the synthesis of highly functionalized tropone derivatives under mild conditions with high atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economy. In this reaction, one vinylallene acts as a C4 synthon, the other vinylallene as a C2 synthon, and CO as a C1 synthon.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed [4+2+1] reactions of dienes (or diene derivatives such as vinylallenes), alkynes/alkenes, and CO (or carbenes) are expected to be the most straightforward approach to synthesize challenging seven&#8208;membered ring compounds, but so far only limited successes have been realized. Here, an unexpected three&#8208;component [4+2+1] reaction between two vinylallenes and CO was discovered to give highly functionalized tropone derivatives under mild conditions, where one vinylallene acts as a C4 synthon, the other vinylallene as a C2 synthon, and CO as a C1 synthon. It was proposed that this reaction occurred via oxidative cyclization of the diene part of one vinylallene molecule, followed by insertion of the terminal alkene part of the allene moiety in another vinylallene, into the Rh&#8722;C bond of five&#8208;membered rhodacycle. Then, CO insertion and reductive elimination gave the [4+2+1] cycloadduct. Further experimental exploration of why ene/yne&#8208;vinylallenes and CO gave monocyclic tropone derivatives instead of 6/7&#8208;bicyclic ring products were reported here.

         <title>Ultrafast Dynamics and Photoresponse of a Fungi&#8208;Derived Pigment Xylindein from Solution to Thin Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 18, Page 5627-5631, March 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
From fungi to optoelectronics: Xylindein, a naturally occurring pigment secreted by wood&#8208;decaying fungi, offers promising properties as an organic material for optoelectronics. Femtosecond transient absorption with a near&#8208;infrared probe reveals an ultrafast excited state proton transfer in solution and excimer formation in aggregates and thin films. Rational design by extending the sidechains of xylindein is envisioned to hinder excimers and enhance optoelectronic performance.







Abstract
Organic semiconductor materials have recently gained momentum due to their non&#8208;toxicity, low cost, and sustainability. Xylindein is a remarkably photostable pigment secreted by fungi that grow on decaying wood, and its relatively strong electronic performance is enabled by &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and hydrogen&#8208;bonding network that promote charge transport. Herein, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with a near&#8208;IR probe was used to unveil a rapid excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer reaction. Conformational motions potentially lead to a conical intersection that quenches fluorescence in the monomeric state. In concentrated solutions, nascent aggregates exhibit a faster excited state lifetime due to excimer formation, confirmed by the excimer&#8594;charge&#8208;transfer excited&#8208;state absorption band of the xylindein thin film, thus limiting its optoelectronic performance. Therefore, extending the xylindein sidechains with branched alkyl groups may hinder the excimer formation and improve optoelectronic properties of naturally derived materials.

Therefore, extending the xylindein sidechains with branched alkyl groups may hinder the excimer formation and improve optoelectronic properties of naturally derived materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Continuous Flow Synthesis of Metal&#8211;NHC Complexes**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 18, Page 5653-5657, March 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication: Taking advantage of the mechanistic understanding of the weak base route to access metal&#8211;NHC complexes, the first continuous flow syntheses of CuI&#8208;, AuI&#8208; and PdII&#8208;NHC complexes using very mild conditions (40&#8201;&#176;C, 2&#8197;min in technical grade acetone) are described.







Abstract
The use of weak bases and mild conditions is currently the most sustainable and attractive synthetic approach for the preparation of late&#8208;transition metal complexes, some of which are widely used in catalysis, medicinal chemistry and materials science. Herein, the use of cuprate, aurate or palladate species for a continuous flow preparation of CuI, AuI and PdII&#8208;NHC complexes is reported. All reactions examined proceed under extremely mild conditions and make use of technical grade acetone as solvent. The scalability of the process was exemplified in a multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of [Cu(IPr)Cl].

         <title>Accelerating H2 Evolution by Anodic Semi&#8208;dehydrogenation of Tetrahydroisoquinolines in Water over Co3O4 Nanoribbon Arrays Decorated Nickel Foam</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coupling H  2  evolution reaction in water with thermodynamically favorable organic oxidation reactions is highly desirable, because it can enhance the energy conversion efficiency compared with the electrocatalytic water splitting, and produce value&#8208;added chemicals instead of O  2  in anodic reaction. Herein, Co  3  O  4  nanoribbon arrays in situ grown on nickel foam (Co  3  O  4  @NF) was employed as an effective electrocatalyst for the selective oxidation of tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs). Various value&#8208;added semi&#8208;dehydrogenation products including dihydroisoquinolines with electro&#8208;deficient or rich groups could be obtained with moderate yields and faradaic efficiencies. Benefitting from the rich surface active sites of Co  3  O  4  @NF, a two&#8208;electrode (Co  3  O  4  @NF || Pt) electrolytic system drove a benchmark current density of 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  at a cell voltage as low as 1.446 V in 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution containing 0.02 M THIQ, which was reduced by 174 mV in comparison with that of overall water splitting.</dc:description>

         <title>Reaction Mechanisms of Fluoroethylene Carbonate Degradation, an Additive of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries, Unraveled by Radiation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous additives are used in electrolytes of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, especially for the formation of efficient solid electrolyte interphase at the surface of the electrodes. The understanding of the degradation processes of these compounds is thus important. They can be obtained through radiolysis. In the case of fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), picosecond pulse radiolysis experiments evidenced the formation of FEC  &#9679;&#8208;  . This radical is stabilized in neat FEC, whereas the ring opens to form more stable radical anions when FEC is a solute in other solvents, as confirmed by quantum chemistry calculations. In neat FEC, pre&#8208;solvated electrons primarily undergo attachment compared to solvation. At long timescales, produced gases (H  2  , CO, and CO  2  ) were quantified. A reaction scheme for both the oxidizing and reducing pathways at stake in irradiated FEC was proposed. This work evidences that the nature of the primary species formed in FEC depends on the amount of FEC in the solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Effects of Incorporation of 2&#180;&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;2&#180;2&#180;&#8208;difluorodeoxycytidine (Gemcitabine) in A&#8208; and B&#8208;form Duplexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here the structural effect of 2&#180;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#180;,2&#180;&#8208;difluorocytidine (dFdC) insertions in the DNA strand of a DNA:RNA hybrid duplex and in a self&#8208;complementary DNA:DNA duplex. In both cases, the modification slightly destabilizes the duplex and provokes minor local distortions that are more pronounced in the case of the DNA:RNA hybrid. Analysis of the solution structures determined by NMR methods show that dFdC is an adaptable derivative that adopts North type sugar conformation when inserted in pure DNA, or a South sugar conformation in the context of DNA:RNA hybrids. In this latter context, South sugar pucker favors the formation of a 2&#180;F..H8 attractive interaction with a neighbouring purine, which compensates the destabilizing effect of base pair distortions. These interactions share some features with pseudohydrogen bonds described previously in other nucleic acids structures with fluorine modified sugars.</dc:description>

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding Ion&#8208;pair Cryptand Host Discrimination of Potassium Halide Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of chalcogen, halogen and hydrogen bonding heteroditopic macrobicyclic cryptands are reported and their potassium halide ion&#8208;pair recognition properties investigated. Saliently, the co&#8208;bound potassium cation was determined to be crucial in switching on the bromide and iodide recognition properties of the respective cryptand receptor. Importantly, the nature of the sigma&#8208;hole mediated interaction employed in the anion recognition component is demonstrated to significantly augment the ion&#8208;pair binding behaviour, markedly so for the halogen bonding analogue. Most notably the incorporation of a chelating chalcogen bonding donor motif significantly improves the selectivity towards KBr over KI, relative to halogen and hydrogen bonding analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Tools for the Study of ADP&#8208;ribosylation: A Unified and Versatile Method to Synthesise Native Mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ADP&#8208;ribosylation (ADPr), as a post&#8208;translational modification, plays a crucial role in DNA&#8208;repair, immunity and many other cellular and physiological processes. Serine is the main acceptor for ADPr in DNA damage response, whereas the physiological impact of less common ADPr&#8208;modifications of cysteine and threonine side chains is less clear. Generally, gaining molecular insights into ADPr recognition and turn&#8208;over is hampered by the availability of homogeneous, ADP&#8208;ribosylated material, such as mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated (MARylated) peptides. Here, we describe a new and efficient solid&#8208;phase strategy for the synthesis of Ser&#8208;, Thr and Cys&#8208;MARylated peptides. ADP&#8208;ribosylated cysteine, apart from being a native post&#8208;translational modification in its own right, proved to be suitable as a stabile bioisostere for ADP&#8208;ribosylated serine making it a useful tool to further biochemical research on serine ADP&#8208;ribosylation. As well, we discovered that the Streptococcus pyogenes encoded protein, Spy MacroD, acts as a Cys&#8208;(ADP&#8208;ribosyl) hydrolase.</dc:description>

         <title>3D Uranyl Organic Frameworks Supported by Rigid Octadentate Carboxylate ligand: Synthesis, Structure Diversity, and Luminescence Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Seven three dimensional(3D) uranyl organic frameworks(UOFs) have been hydrothermally prepared using a rigid octadentate carboxylate ligand, tetrakis(3,5&#8208;dicarboxyphenyl)silicon(H  8  TTDS). These UOFs have different 3D self&#8208;assembled structures as a function of co&#8208;ligands, structure&#8208;directing agents and transition metals. The structure of  1  has an infinite ribbon formed by the UO  7  pentagonal bipyramid bridged by carboxylate groups. With further introduction of auxiliary N&#8208;donor ligands, different structure of  2  and  3  are formed, in  2  the imidazole serves as space filler, while in  3  the Phen are bound to [UO  2  ]  2+  units as co&#8208;ligands. The second metal centers were introduced in the syntheses of  4  &#8208;  7  , and in all cases, they are part of the final structures, either as a counterion (  4  ) or as a component of framework (  5  &#8722;  7  ). Interesting, in  7  , a rare polyoxometalate [Cu  3  (&#956;  3  &#8208;OH)O  7  (O  2  CR)  4  ] cluster was found in the structure. It acts as an inorganic building unit together with the dimer [(UO  2  )  2  (O  2  CR)  4  ] unit. Those new uranyl carboxylates were sufficiently determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, and their topological structures and luminescence properties were analyzed in detail.</dc:description>

         <title>Acetylenic Replacement of Albicidin&#8217;s Methacrylamide Residue Circumvents Detrimental (E)&#8208;(Z)&#8208;Photoisomerization and Preserves Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The natural product albicidin is a highly potent inhibitor of bacterial DNA gyrase. Its outstanding activity, particularly against Gram&#8208;negative pathogens, qualifies it as a promising lead structure in the search for new antibacterial drugs. However, here we show that the N&#8208;terminal cinnamoyl moiety of albicidin is susceptible to photochemical (  E  )&#8208;(  Z  )&#8208;isomerization. Moreover, the newly formed (  Z  )&#8208;isomer exhibits significantly reduced antibacterial activity, which hampers development and biological evaluation of albicidin and potent derivatives thereof. Hence, we synthesized 13 different variations of albicidin in which the vulnerable  para  &#8208;coumaric acid moiety was replaced thus yielding photostable analogues. Biological activity assays revealed that diaryl alkyne analogues exhibited virtually undiminished antibacterial efficacy. This promising scaffold will therefore serve as a blueprint for the design of a potent albicidin&#8208;based drug.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated Azobenzenes Switchable with Red Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular photoswitches triggered with red or NIR light are optimal for photomodulation of complex biological systems, including efficient penetration of the human body for therapeutic purposes (&#8220;therapeutic window&#8221;). Yet, they are rarely reported, and even more rarely functional under aqueous conditions. Here we show that fluorinated azobenzenes exhibit efficient  E  &#8208;&gt;Z  photoisomerization with red light (PSS  660nm  &gt;&#160;75&#160;%  Z  ) upon conjugation with unsaturated substituents. Initially demonstrated for aldehyde groups, this effect was also observed in a more complex structure by incorporating the chromophore into a cyclic dipeptide with propensity for self&#8208;assembly. Under physiological conditions, the latter molecule formed a supramolecular material that reversibly changed its viscosity upon irradiation with red light. Our observation can lead to design of new photopharmacology agents or phototriggered materials for  in vivo  use</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A detailed analysis of a complete set of the local potentials that appear in the Euler equation for electron density is carried out for noncovalent interactions in the crystal of a uracil derivative using experimental X&#8208;ray charge density. The interplay between the quantum theory of atoms in molecules and crystals and the local potentials and corresponding inner&#8208;crystal electronic forces of electrostatic and kinetic origin is explored. Partitioning of crystal space into atomic basins and atomic&#8208;like potential basins led us to the definite description of interatomic interaction and charge transfer. Novel physically grounded bonding descriptors derived within the orbital&#8208;free quantum crystallography provided the detailed examination of &#960;&#8208;stacking and intricate C=O&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;&#960; interactions and nonclassical hydrogen bonds present in the crystal. The donor&#8208;acceptor character of these interactions is revealed by analysis of Pauli and von Weizs&#228;cker potentials together with well&#8208;known functions, e.g., deformation electron density and electron localization function. In this way, our analysis throws light on aspects of these closed&#8208;shell interactions hitherto hidden from the description.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Uniform Gold Nanorods with Large Width to Realize Ultralow SERS Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we successfully demonstrate high&#8208;yield synthesis of high&#8208;quality gold nanorods (Au NRs) with width ranging from 6.5 nm to 175 nm by introducing heptanol molecules as secondary templating agents during cetyltrimethylammonium bromide&#8208;templated, seeded growth method. Our results showed that an appropriate concentration of heptanol molecules can not only alter micellization behavior of CTAB in water, but also help silver ions impact the symmetry&#8208;breaking efficiency of additional Au&#8208;NP seeds in addition to enhance the utilization of gold precursors. Moreover, the generality and versatility of the present strategy for synthesis Au NRs with flexible controlled dimensions are further demonstrated by successful synthesis of Au NRs with the assistance of other fatty alcohols with properly long alkyl chains. Furthermore, when arrays of vertically aligned Au NRs with large width (AVA&#8208;Au  120&#215;90  NRs) are used as SERS substrates, they can achieve the ultralow limit of detection for crystal violet (10  &#8208;16  M) with good reliability and reproducibility, and the rapid detection and identification of residual harmful substances.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of a fully deprotected Kdo&#8208;containing rhamnogalacturonan II pentasaccharide is described. The strategy relies on the preparation of a suitably protected homogalacturonan tetrasaccharide backbone through a post&#8208;glycosylation oxidation approach, and its stereoselective glycosylation with a Kdo fluoride donor.</dc:description>

         <title>Mapping C&#8722;H&#8230;M Interactions in Confined spaces: (&#945;&#8208;ICyDMe)Au, Ag, Cu Complexes Reveal &#8220;Contra&#8208;electrostatic H&#8208;bonds&#8221; Masquerading as Anagostic Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>What happens when a C&#8722;H bond is forced to interact with unpaired pairs of electrons at a positively charged metal? Such interactions can be considered as &#8220;contra&#8208;electrostatic&#8221; H&#8208;bonds, which combine the familiar orbital interaction pattern characteristic for the covalent contribution to the conventional H&#8208;bonding with an unusual contra&#8208;electrostatic component. While electrostatics is strongly stabilizing component in the conventional C&#8722;H  &#8230;  X bonds where X is an electronegative main group element, it is destabilizing in the C&#8722;H  &#8230;  M contacts when M is Au(I), Ag(I), or Cu(I) of NHC&#8722;M&#8722;Cl systems. Such remarkable C&#8722;H  &#8230;  M interaction became experimentally accessible within (&#945;&#8208;ICyD  Me  )MCl, NHC&#8722;Metal complexes embedded into cyclodextrins. Computational analysis of the model systems suggests that the overall interaction energies are relatively insensitive to moderate variations in the directionality of interaction between a C&#8722;H bond and the metal center, indicating stereoelectronic promiscuity of fully filled set of  d  &#8208;orbitals. A combination of experimental and computational data demonstrates that metal encapsulation inside the cyclodextrin cavity forces the C&#8722;H bond to point toward the metal, and reveals a still attractive &#8220;contra&#8208;electrostatic&#8221; H&#8208;bonding interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Prediction and Validation of a Druggable Site on Virulence Factor of Drug Resistant Burkholderia cenocepacia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Burkholderia cenocepacia  is an opportunistic gram&#8208;negative bacterium that causes infections in patients suffering from chronic granulomatous diseases and cystic fibrosis. It displays significant morbidity and mortality due to extreme resistance to almost all clinically useful antibiotics. The bacterial lectin BC2L&#8208;C expressed in  B. cenocepacia  is an interesting drug target involved in bacterial adhesion and subsequent deadly infection to the host. We solved the first high resolution crystal structure of the  apo  form of the lectin N&#8208;terminal domain (BC2L&#8208;C&#8208;nt) and compared it with the ones complexed with carbohydrate ligands. Virtual screening of a small fragment library identified potential hits predicted to bind in the vicinity of the fucose binding site. A series of biophysical techniques and a X&#8208;ray crystallographic screening were employed to validate the interaction of the hits with the protein domain. The X&#8208;ray structure of BC2L&#8208;C&#8208;nt complexed with one of the identified active fragments confirmed the ability of the site computationally identified to host drug&#8208;like fragments. The fragment affinity could be determined by titration microcalorimetry. These structure&#8208;based strategies further provide an opportunity to elaborate the fragments into high affinity anti&#8208;adhesive glycomimetics, as therapeutic agents against  B. cenocepacia.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This report describes the site&#8208;selective &#945;&#8208;functionalization of sulfonylamide derivatives through the in&#8208;situ generation of imine intermediates. The N&#8208;F sulfonylamides which could facilitate the elimination to generate imines are coupled with TBACN to efficiently and mildly afford &#945;&#8208;amino cyanides. Comparing with Strecker reaction, this transformation offered a complementary strategy to efficiently construct &#945;&#8208;amino cyanides from direct &#945; C&#8208;H functionalization of sulfonylamindes. &#160;The reaction is also featured with broad substrate scope and flash chromatography column free work up.

         <dc:description>Although tetraphenylethylene (TPE) and its derivatives have been the most commonly used building blocks in the con&#8208;struction of molecules with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) properties, no absolute consensus exists regarding the mechanisms at the origin of the phenomenon. Restriction of Intramolecular Rotations (RIR) of peripheral phenyls has historically been a dominant paradigm which has served as a valuable guideline in the molecular engineering of AIEgens. Yet, an increasing number of recent works have established that photoisomerization or photocyclization may actively participate in the nonradiative dissipation of the excitation energy. In this paper, we bring the first experimental evalua&#8208;tion of the quantum efficiencies of these different processes, and show that photoisomerization is by far the dominant photophysical pathway in solution, accounting for virtually all nonradiative decay of the molecule's excited state in de&#8208;gassed solution.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of desepoxy&#8208;tedanolide C is accomplished and provides experimental evidence on the configuration of tedanolide C. The reported chemical shifts and coupling constants point to a configuration different from the published structure and analogous to the structures of the other members of this family of natural products. The key step is a Kiyooka aldol protocol for the stereoselective synthesis of the tertiary alcohol flanked by three additional oxygenated carbon atoms. Furthermore, two additional aldol reactions and a Julia&#8211;Kocienski olefination are used to assemble the carbon framework.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent 2D&#8208;Patterning, Local Electronic Structure and Polarization Switching of Graphene at the Nanometer Level</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on a very facile and efficient protocol for the covalent patterning and properties tuning of graphene. Highly reactive fluorine radicals were added to confined regions of graphene directed by laser writing on graphene coated with 1&#8208;fluoro&#8208;3,3&#8208;dimethylbenziodoxole. This process allows for the realization of exquisite patterns on graphene with resolutions down to 200 nm. The degree of functionalization &#8211; ranging from the unfunctionalized graphene to extremely high functionalized graphene &#8208; can be precisely tuned by controlling the laser irradiation time. Subsequent substitution of the initially patterned fluorine atoms afforded an unprecedented graphene nanostructure bearing thiophene groups. This substitution led to a complete switch of both the electronic structure and the polarization within the patterned graphene regions. Our approach paves the way towards the precise modulation of the structure and properties of nanostructured graphene.</dc:description>

         <title>Interconnectivity between Surface Reactivity and Self&#8208;assembly of Kemp Elimination Catalyzing Nanorods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the fundamental facts behind dynamicity of catalytic processes has been a longstanding quest across disciplines. Herein, we report self&#8208;assembly of a catalytically active gold nanorod that can be regulated by tuning its reactivity towards a proton transfer reaction at different pH. Unlike substrate&#8208;induced templating and co&#8208;operativity, the enhanced aggregation rate is due to alteration of catalytic surface charge only during reactivity as negatively charged transition state of reactant (5&#8208;nitrobenzisoxazole) is formed on positively charged nanorod while undergoing a concerted E2&#8208;pathway. Herein, enhanced diffusivity during catalytic processes might also act as an additional contributing factor. Furthermore, we have also shown that nanosized hydrophobic cavities of clustered nanorods can also efficiently accelerate the rate of an aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction, which also demonstrates a catalytic phenomenon that can lead to cascading of other reactions where substrates and products of the starting reactions are not directly involved.</dc:description>

Abstract
Organothiocyanate and organoselenocyanate compounds are of paramount importance in organic chemistry as they are key intermediates to access sulfur&#8208; and selenium&#8208;containing compounds. Therefore, among the different synthetic pathways to get SCN&#8208; and SeCN&#8208;containing molecules, original methodologies using electrophilic reagents have recently been explored. This Minireview will showcase the recent advances that have been made. In particular, the design of several electrophilic sources and their applications for the thiocyanation and the selenocyanation of various classes of compounds will be highlighted and discussed.

         <dc:description>The dauc&#8208;8&#8208;en&#8208;11&#8208;ol synthase from Streptomyces venezuelae was investigated for its catalytic activity towards alternative terpene precursors, specifically designed to enable new cyclisation pathways. Exchange of aromatic amino acid residues at the enzyme surface by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis led to a 4&#8208;fold increase of the yield in preparative scale incubations, which likely results from an increased enzyme stability instead of improved enzyme kinetics.</dc:description>

         <title>Azide&#8208;Functionalized Derivatives of the Virulence&#8208;Associated Sugar Pseudaminic Acid: Chiral Pool Synthesis and Labeling of Bacteria</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pseudaminic acid (Pse) is a significant prokaryotic monosaccharide found in important Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. This unique sugar serves as a component of cell&#8208;surface&#8208;associated glycans or glycoproteins and is associated with their virulence. We report the synthesis of azidoacetamido&#8208;functionalized Pse derivatives as part of a search for Pse&#8209;derived metabolic labeling reagents. The synthesis was initiated with D&#8209;glucose (Glc), which served as a cost&#8208;effective chiral pool starting material. Key synthetic steps involve the conversion of C1 of Glc into the terminal methyl group of Pse, and inverting deoxyaminations at C3 and C5 of Glc followed by backbone elongation with a three&#8208;carbon unit using the Barbier reaction. Metabolic labeling experiments revealed that, of the four Pse derivatives, ester&#8208;protected C5 azidoacetamido&#8209;Pse successfully labeled cells of Pse&#8209;expressing Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative strains. No labeling was observed in cells of non&#8209;Pse&#8208;expressing strains. The ester&#8208;protected and C5 azidoacetamido&#8208;functionalized Pse is thus a useful reagent for the identification of bacteria expressing this unique virulence&#8208;associated nonulosonic acid.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The four non&#8208;canonical nucleotides in the human genome 5&#8209;methyl&#8208;, 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;, 5&#8208;formyl&#8208; and 5&#8208;carboxydeoxycytidine (mdC, hmdC, fdC and cadC) form a second layer of epigenetic information that contributes to the regulation of gene expression. Formation of the oxidized nucleotides hmdC, fdC and cadC requires oxidation of mdC by ten&#8208;eleven translocation (Tet) enzymes that require oxygen, Fe(II) and a&#8208;ketoglutarate as cosubstrates. Although these oxidized forms of mdC are widespread in mammalian genomes, experimental evidence for their presence in fungi and plants is ambiguous. This vagueness is caused by the fact that these oxidized mdC derivatives are also formed as oxidative lesions, resulting in unclear basal levels that are likely to have no epigenetic function. Here, we report the xdC levels in the fungus Amanita muscaria in comparison to murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs), HEK cells and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), to obtain information about the basal levels of hmdC, fdC and cadC as DNA lesions in the genome.</dc:description>

         <title>Surprising Homolytic Gas Phase Co&#8722;C Bond Dissociation Energies of Organometallic Aryl&#8208;Cobinamides Reveal Notable Non&#8208;Bonded Intramolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crucial resistance of aryl&#8208;cobalamins, as antivitamins B12, against metabolic conversion into B12 cofactors has been traced to their presumed strong organometallic bond. The strength of the Co&#8722;C bond of aryl&#8208;cobinamides was examined here by ESI&#8208;MS threshold collision&#8208;induced dissociation (CID) experiments. Surprisingly, the Co&#8722;C
 bonds of these aryl&#8208;corrins were less strong than the Co&#8722;C
 bond in their methyl analogue, revealing the relevance of non&#8208;bonded interactions.







Abstract
Aryl&#8208;cobalamins are a new class of organometallic structural mimics of vitamin B12 designed as potential &#8216;antivitamins B12&#8217;. Here, the first cationic aryl&#8208;cobinamides are described, which were synthesized using the newly developed diaryl&#8208;iodonium method. The aryl&#8208;cobinamides were obtained as pairs of organometallic coordination isomers, the stereo&#8208;structure of which was unambiguously assigned based on homo&#8208; and heteronuclear NMR spectra. The availability of isomers with axial attachment of the aryl group, either at the &#8216;beta&#8217; or at the &#8216;alpha&#8217; face of the cobalt&#8208;center allowed for an unprecedented comparison of the organometallic reactivity of such pairs. The homolytic gas&#8208;phase bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of the coordination&#8208;isomeric phenyl&#8208; and 4&#8208;ethylphenyl&#8208;cobinamides were determined by ESI&#8208;MS threshold CID experiments, furnishing (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDEs of 38.4 and 40.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively, for the two &#946;&#8208;isomers, and the larger BDEs of 46.6 and 43.8&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for the corresponding &#945;&#8208;isomers. Surprisingly, the observed (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDEs of the Co&#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;cobinamides were smaller than the (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDE of Co&#946;&#8208;methyl&#8208;cobinamide. DFT studies and the magnitudes of the experimental (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDEs revealed relevant contributions of non&#8208;bonded interactions in aryl&#8208;cobinamides, notably steric strain between the aryl and the cobalt&#8208;corrin moieties and non&#8208;bonded interactions with and among the peripheral sidechains.

         <title>Mononuclear Dysprosium Alkoxide and Aryloxide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mononuclear lanthanide single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) have progressively evolved in recent years. Lanthanide alkoxide and aryloxide chemistry offers a modular design approach to study the relaxation dynamics of high&#8208;performing SMMs. Alkoxide and aryloxide ligands on a single axis at a DyIII ion enhances the magnetic anisotropy and the barrier to magnetic reversal (Ueff). Leading examples of DyIII alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs are discussed in this review.







Abstract
Recent studies have shown that mononuclear lanthanide (Ln) complexes can be high&#8208;performing single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). Recently, there has been an influx of mononuclear Ln alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs, which have provided the necessary geometrical control to improve SMM properties and to allow the intricate relaxation dynamics of Ln SMMs to be studied in detail. Here non&#8208;aqueous Ln alkoxide and aryloxide chemistry applied to the synthesis of low&#8208;coordinate mononuclear Ln SMMs are reviewed. The focus is on mononuclear DyIII alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs with coordination numbers up to eight, covering synthesis, solid&#8208;state structures and magnetic attributes. Brief overviews are also provided of mononuclear TbIII, HoIII, ErIII and YbIII alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mononuclear lanthanide single&#8208;molecule magnets&lt;/b&gt; (SMMs) have progressively evolved in recent years. Lanthanide alkoxide and aryloxide chemistry offers a modular design approach to study the relaxation dynamics of high&#8208;performing SMMs. Alkoxide and aryloxide ligands on a single axis at a Dy&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; ion enhances the magnetic anisotropy and the barrier to magnetic reversal (&lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;). Leading examples of Dy&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs are discussed in this review.

         <title>Temperature Dependence of 1H Paramagnetic Chemical Shifts in Actinide Complexes, Beyond Bleaney's Theory: The AnIVO22+&#8211;Dipicolinc Acid Complexes (

NMR spectroscopy: The temperature dependence of paramagnetic 1H NMR chemical shifts are measured and modelled in the AnIVO22+&#8211;dipicolinic acid complexes. Only the pseudocontact term is non&#8208;zero. The magnetic susceptibility tensor, the energy states and magnetic moments of the paramagnetic center are deduced and compared to the SO&#8208;CASPT2 values.







Abstract
Actinide +VI complexes (
=
, 
 and 
) with dipicolinic acid derivatives were synthesized and characterized by powder XRD, SQUID magnetometry and NMR spectroscopy. In addition, 
 and 
 complexes were described by first principles CAS based and two&#8208;component spin&#8208;restricted DFT methods. The analysis of the 1H paramagnetic NMR chemical shifts for all protons of the ligands according to the X&#8208;rays structures shows that the Fermi contact contribution is negligible in agreement with spin density determined by unrestricted DFT. The magnetic susceptibility tensor is determined by combining SQUID, pNMR shifts and Evans&#8217; method. The SO&#8208;RASPT2 results fit well the experimental magnetic susceptibility and pNMR chemical shifts. The role of the counterions in the solid phase is pointed out; their presence impacts the magnetic properties of the 
 complex. The temperature dependence of the pNMR chemical shifts has a strong 
 contribution, contrarily to Bleaney's theory for lanthanide complexes. The fitting of the temperature dependence of the pNMR chemical shifts and SQUID magnetic susceptibility by a two&#8208;Kramers&#8208;doublet model for the 
 complex and a non&#8208;Kramers&#8208;doublet model for the 
 complex allows for the experimental evaluation of energy gaps and magnetic moments of the paramagnetic center.

         <title>Synthesis of Glycodendrimers with Antiviral and Antibacterial Activity</title>

Sticky scaffolds: The state of the art in the design and synthesis of glycodendrimers for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against bacterial and viral infections is described.







Abstract
Glycodendrimers are an important class of synthetic macromolecules that can be used to mimic many structural and functional features of cell&#8208;surface glycoconjugates. Their carbohydrate moieties perform key important functions in bacterial and viral infections, often regulated by carbohydrate&#8211;protein interactions. Several studies have shown that the molecular structure, valency and spatial organisation of carbohydrate epitopes in glycoconjugates are key factors in the specificity and avidity of carbohydrate&#8211;protein interactions. Choosing the right glycodendrimers almost always helps to interfere with such interactions and blocks bacterial or viral adhesion and entry into host cells as an effective strategy to inhibit bacterial or viral infections. Herein, the state of the art in the design and synthesis of glycodendrimers employed for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against bacterial and viral infections is described.

Golden carbene emitter systems: N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes that efficiently emit in the sky&#8208;blue to green part of the electromagnetic spectrum are reported. A first example of a solution&#8208;processable organic light&#8208;emitting device has been realized for this class of gold(III) complexes, revealing unique opportunities presented by these highly efficient gold(III) carbene emitter systems.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) cyclometalated gold(III) complexes remain very scarce and therefore their photophysical properties remain currently underexplored. Moreover, gold(III) complexes emitting in the blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum are rare. In this work, a series of four phosphorescent gold(III) complexes was investigated bearing four different NHC monocyclometalated (C^C*)&#8208;type ligands and a dianionic (N^N)&#8208;type ancillary ligand ((N^N)=5,5&#8217;&#8208;(propane&#8208;2,2&#8208;diyl)bis(3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1&#8201;H&#8208;pyrazole) (mepzH2)). The complexes exhibit strong phosphorescence when doped in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) at room temperature, which were systematically tuned from sky&#8208;blue [&#955;PL=456&#8197;nm, CIE coordinates: (0.20, 034)] to green [&#955;PL=516&#8197;nm, CIE coordinates: (0.31, 0.54)] by varying the monocyclometalated (C^C*) ligand framework. The complexes revealed high quantum efficiencies (&#981;PL) of up to 43&#8201;% and excited&#8208;state lifetimes (&#964;0) between 15&#8211;266&#8197;&#956;s. The radiative rate constant values found for these complexes (kr=103&#8211;104&#8197;s&#8722;1) are the highest found in comparison to previously known best&#8208;performing monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes. Density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations of these complexes further lend support to the excited&#8208;state nature of these complexes. The calculations showed a significant contribution of the gold(III) metal center in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of up to 18&#8201;%, which was found to be unique for this class of cyclometalated gold(III) complexes. Additionally, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) were fabricated by using a solution process to provide the first insight into the electroluminescent (EL) properties of this new class of gold(III) complexes.

&lt;p&gt;N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) cyclometalated gold(III) complexes remain very scarce and therefore their photophysical properties remain currently underexplored. Moreover, gold(III) complexes emitting in the blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum are rare. In this work, a series of four phosphorescent gold(III) complexes was investigated bearing four different NHC monocyclometalated (C^C*)&#8208;type ligands and a dianionic (N^N)&#8208;type ancillary ligand ((N^N)=5,5&#8217;&#8208;(propane&#8208;2,2&#8208;diyl)bis(3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1&#8201;&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;pyrazole) (mepzH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)). The complexes exhibit strong phosphorescence when doped in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) at room temperature, which were systematically tuned from sky&#8208;blue [&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;PL&lt;/sub&gt;=456&#8197;nm, CIE coordinates: (0.20, 034)] to green [&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;PL&lt;/sub&gt;=516&#8197;nm, CIE coordinates: (0.31, 0.54)] by varying the monocyclometalated (C^C*) ligand framework. The complexes revealed high quantum efficiencies (&lt;i&gt;&#981;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;PL&lt;/sub&gt;) of up to 43&#8201;% and excited&#8208;state lifetimes (&lt;i&gt;&#964;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) between 15&#8211;266&#8197;&#956;s. The radiative rate constant values found for these complexes (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;=10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) are the highest found in comparison to previously known best&#8208;performing monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes. Density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations of these complexes further lend support to the excited&#8208;state nature of these complexes. The calculations showed a significant contribution of the gold(III) metal center in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of up to 18&#8201;%, which was found to be unique for this class of cyclometalated gold(III) complexes. Additionally, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) were fabricated by using a solution process to provide the first insight into the electroluminescent (EL) properties of this new class of gold(III) complexes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Co&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Intramolecular [3+2] Cycloaddition of Yne&#8208;Alkylidenecyclopropanes and its Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Co&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric intramolecular [3+2] reaction of yne&#8208;alkylidenecyclopropanes (yne&#8208;ACPs) using a commercially available ligand has been realized for the synthesis of 5/5 and 6/5 bicycles. This reaction avoids the use of precious Pd and Rh catalysts usually used for these reactions. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction takes places via oxidative cyclometallation of the alkyne and the ACP, ring opening of the cyclopropyl group, and reductive elimination.







Abstract
Developing new transition metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cycloadditions for the synthesis of five&#8208;membered carbocycles (FMCs) is a research frontier in reaction development due to the ubiquitous presence of chiral FMCs in various functional molecules. Reported here is our discovery of a highly enantioselective intramolecular [3+2] cycloaddition of yne&#8208;alkylidenecyclopropanes (yne&#8208;ACPs) to bicyclo[3.3.0]octadiene and bicyclo[4.3.0]nonadiene molecules using a cheap Co catalyst and commercially available chiral ligand (S)&#8208;Xyl&#8208;BINAP. This reaction avoids the use of precious Pd and Rh catalysts, which are usually the choices for [3+2] reactions with ACPs. The enantiomeric excess in the present reaction can be up to 92&#8201;%. Cationic cobalt(I) species was suggested by experiments as the catalytic species. DFT calculations showed that this [3+2] reaction starts with oxidative cyclometallation of alkyne and ACP, followed by ring opening of the cyclopropyl (CP) group and reductive elimination to form the cycloadduct. This mechanism is different from previous [3+2] reactions of ACPs, which usually start from CP cleavage, not from oxidative cyclization.

N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes: Highly efficient photoluminescence was achieved in the sky&#8208;blue to green part of the electromagnetic spectrum using strong s&#8208;donating cyclometalated NHC ligands and a dianionic (N&#8201;N)&#8208;type bidentate as the ancillary ligand. Detailed photophysical investigations supported by density functional theory calculations provide insights into the excited&#8208;state properties of this new class of emitter molecules. The realization of the first solution&#8208;processable OLED device based on these strongly luminescent gold(III) carbene emitter systems opens up exciting new opportunities in light emitting applications.

         <title>Unveiling Luminescent IrI and RhI N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complexes: Structure, Photophysical Specifics, and Cellular Localization in the Endoplasmic Reticulum</title>

Anticancer NHC complexes: RhI and IrI N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes provide an auspicious class of potential new anticancer agents; however, cellular imaging with luminescent derivatives of these complex types is often hampered by luminescence quenching. Building on an analysis of the parameters for metal&#8208;induced quenching processes, new examples of this complex class are designed with properties suitable for cellular imaging. Their main localization in the endoplasmic reticulum is not only an unprecedented finding but also represents the first ever insight into the cellular localization of Ir(NHC) complexes in the oxidation state +I.







Abstract
Complexes of RhI and IrI of the [M(COD)(NHC)X] type (where M=Rh or Ir, COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene, NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, and X=halide) have recently shown promising cytotoxic activities against several cancer cell lines. Initial mechanism of action studies provided some knowledge about their interaction with DNA and proteins. However, information about their cellular localization remains scarce owing to luminescence quenching within this complex type. Herein, the synthesis of two rare examples of luminescent RhI and IrI [M(COD)(NHC)I] complexes with 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide&#8208;based emitting ligands is reported. All new complexes are comprehensively characterized, including with single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures. Steric crowding in one derivative leads to two distinct rotamers in solution, which apparently can be distinguished both by pronounced NMR shifts and by their respective spectral and temporal emission signatures. When the photophysical properties of these new complexes are exploited for cellular imaging in HT&#8208;29 and PT&#8208;45 cancer cell lines, it is demonstrated that the complexes accumulate predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is an entirely new finding and provides the first insight into the cellular localization of such IrI(NHC) complexes.

         <title>Carbon Origami via an Alumina&#8208;Assisted Cyclodehydrofluorination Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational folding of nanographenes has the potential to penetrate the barrier between macro&#8208; and micro&#8208;worlds for the engineering of carbon&#8208;based materials with functional molecular shapes. This work reports that an alumina&#8208;mediated C&#8722;F bond activation strategy is able to tackle this challenge allowing both the effective incorporation of non&#8208;hexagonal rings and the formation of helical structures leading to the folding of nanographenes akin to origami.







Abstract
The synthesis of pristine non&#8208;planar nanographenes (NGs) via a cyclodehydrofluorination strategy is reported and the creation of highly strained systems via alumina&#8208;assisted C&#8722;F bond activation is shown. Steric hindrance could execute an alternative coupling program leading to rare octagon formation offering access to elusive non&#8208;classical NGs. The combination of two alternative ways of folding could lead to the formation of various 3D NG objects, resembling the Japanese art of origami. The power of the presented &#8220;origami&#8221; approach is proved by the assembly of 12 challenging nanographenes that are &#960;&#8208;isoelectronic to planar hexabenzocoronene but forced out of planarity.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;walled nanotubes and nanoribbons of amino acid amphiphiles are fabricated by using a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer technique, where successive rigid amphiphile layers are glued together by oppositely charged polyelectrolyte. The resulting well&#8208;defined 1D structures are attractive as potential biocompatible delivery systems and building blocks in nanotechnology.







Abstract
Monodisperse unilamellar nanotubes (NTs) and nanoribbons (NRs) were transformed to multilamellar NRs and NTs in a well&#8208;defined fashion. This was done by using a step&#8208;wise approach in which self&#8208;assembled cationic amino acid amphiphile (AAA) formed the initial NTs or NRs, and added polyanion produced an intermediate coating. Successive addition of cationic AAA formed a covering AAA layer, and by repeating this layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) procedure, multi&#8208;walled nanotubes (mwNTs) and nanoribbons were formed. This process was structurally investigated by combining small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) and cryogenic&#8208;transmission electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;TEM), confirming the multilamellar structure and the precise layer spacing. In this way the controlled formation of multi&#8208;walled suprastructures was demonstrated in a simple and reproducible fashion, which allowed to control the charge on the surface of these 1D aggregates. This pathway to 1D colloidal materials is interesting for applications in life science and creating well&#8208;defined building blocks in nanotechnology.

         <title>Additive&#8208;free Aqueous Dispersions of Two&#8208;Dimensional Materials with Glial Cell Compatibility and Enzymatic Degradability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Bioelectronics: Processing of additive&#8208;free aqueous dispersions of 2D materials like transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride is demonstrated, and biological implications like cell compatibility and enzymatic degradability are investigated.







Abstract
Water&#8208;dispersible two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials are desirable for diverse applications. Aqueous dispersions make processing safer and greener and enable evaluation of these materials on biological and environmental fronts. To evaluate the effects of 2D materials with biological systems, obtaining dispersions without additives is critical and has been a challenge. Herein, a method was developed for obtaining additive&#8208;free aqueous dispersions of 2D materials like transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN). The nanosheet dispersions were investigated through spectroscopic and microscopic methods, along with the role of size on stability. The aqueous media enabled investigations on cytocompatibility and enzymatic degradation of molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) and h&#8208;BN. Cytocompatibility with mixed glial cells was observed up to concentrations of 100&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1, suggesting their plausible usage in bioelectronics. Besides, biodegradation using human myeloperoxidase (hMPO) mediated catalysis was investigated through Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy. The findings suggested that additive&#8208;free 2H&#8208;MoS2 and h&#8208;BN were degradable by hMPO, with 2H&#8208;phase exhibiting better resistance to degradation than the 1T&#8208;phase, while h&#8208;BN exhibited slower degradation. The findings pave a path for incorporating 2D materials in the burgeoning field of transient bioelectronics.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Investigation of the Structural and Opto&#8208;electronic Properties of Fe&#8208;Doped Lead&#8208;Free Cs2AgBiCl6 Double Perovskite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doubling up: The synthesis and first&#8208;principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations of Fe&#8208;doped, lead&#8208;free dipyramidal shape Cs2AgBiCl6 crystals for photodetector applications are presented. The results of systematic investigation of the crystal structure, morphology, optical properties, band structure, and stability of these materials are discussed.







Abstract
Lead&#8208;free double perovskites have emerged as stable and non&#8208;toxic alternatives to Pb&#8208;halide perovskites. Herein, the synthesis of Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 lead&#8208;free double perovskites are reported that display blue emission using an antisolvent method. The crystal structure, morphology, optical properties, band structure, and stability of the Fe&#8208;doped double perovskites were investigated systematically. Formation of the Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite is confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. XRD and thermo&#8208;gravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that the Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite has high structural and thermal stability, respectively. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE&#8208;SEM) analysis revealed the formation of dipyramidal shape Cs2AgBiCl6 crystals. Furthermore, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping shows the overlapping of Cs, Bi, Ag, Fe, and Cl elements and homogenous incorporation of Fe in Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite. The Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite shows a strong absorption at 380&#8197;nm. It extends up to 700&#8197;nm, suggesting that sub&#8208;band gap states transition may originate from the surface defect of the doped perovskite material. The radiative kinetics of the crystals was studied using the time&#8208;correlated single&#8208;photon counting (TCSPC) technique. Lattice parameters and band gap value of the Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskites predicted by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations are confirmed by XRD and UV/Visible spectroscopy analysis. Time&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;response characteristics of the Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite show fast response and recovery time of charge carriers. We believe that the successful incorporation of Fe in lead&#8208;free, environmentally friendly Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite can open a new class of doped double perovskites with significant potential optoelectronics devices fabrication and photocatalytic applications.

         <title>Conformational Switching through the One&#8208;Electron Reduction of an Acridinium&#8208;based, &#947;&#8208;Cationic Phosphine Gold Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switch it: The reduction of the acridinium&#8208;based &#947;&#8208;cationic phosphine gold chloride complex neutralizes the carbenium unit and affords a stable radical. Due to a perturbation of the electrostatic potential profile of the complex and donor&#8211;acceptor bonding interactions, this reduction alters the complex's conformation, with the linear phosphine&#8208;gold&#8208;chloride moiety undergoing a windshield&#8208;wiper&#8208;type motion over the surface of the acridinium ring.







Abstract
Our efforts in the chemistry of gold complexes featuring ambiphilic phosphine&#8208;carbenium L/Z&#8208;type ligand have led us to consider the reduction of the carbenium moiety as a means to modulate the gold&#8211;carbenium interaction present in these complexes. Here, it was shown that the one&#8208;electron reduction of [(o&#8208;Ph2P(C6H4)Acr)AuCl]+ (Acr=9&#8208;N&#8208;methylacridinium) produces a neutral stable radical, the structure of which showed a marked increase in the Au&#8211;Acr distance. Related structural changes were observed for the phosphine oxide analogue [(o&#8208;Ph2P(O)(C6H4)Acr]+, the reduction of which interfered with the P=O&#8594;carbenium interaction. These structural effects, driven by a reduction&#8208;induced change in the electronic and electrostatic characteristics of the compounds, showed that the charge and accepting properties of the carbenium unit can be modulated. These results highlight the redox&#8208;noninnocence of carbenium Z&#8208;type ligand, a feature that can be exploited to induce specific conformational changes.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Dual C&#8722;C Coupling Reaction via Site Selective Cascade Formation by PdII&#8208;Cryptate of an Amino&#8208;Ether Heteroditopic Macrobicycle</title>

         <dc:description>
PdII catalysed site selective dual C&#8722;C Coupling in the presence of heteroditopic macrobicycle was achieved to synthesize symmetrical and unsymmetrical conjugated 1,3&#8208;diynes.







Abstract
Selectivity of aryl iodo over ethynyl iodo toward the Suzuki cross coupling reaction is explored by utilizing a palladium complex of amino&#8208;ether heteroditopic macrobicycle. Subsequently, unreacted ethynyl iodide undergoes homocoupling reaction in the same catalytic atmosphere, thereby representing a cascade dual C&#8722;C coupling reaction. Furthermore, this approach is extended for novel one&#8208;pot synthesis of unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;diynes.

         <title>Rational Molecular Design of Multifunctional Blue&#8208;Emitting Materials Based on Phenanthroimidazole Derivatives.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deeper blue: On the basis of multifunctional phenanthroimidazole&#8208;based material PTPBPTA, which acts both as a deep&#8208;blue fluorescent emitter and as a host material for phosphors, high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), yellow and red phosphorescent OLEDs, and a white OLED were fabricated.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue emitters with external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) exceeding 5&#8201;% are still scarce in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this work, by introducing a [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5&#8208;a] pyridine (TP) unit at the N1 position of phenanthroimidazole (PI), two luminescent materials, PTPTPA and PTPTPA, were obtained. Systematic photophysical analysis showed that the TP block is suitable for constructing hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) emitters. Its moderate electron&#8208;withdrawing ability and rigid planar structure can enhance the CT component while ensuring color purity. In addition, compared with PTPTPA, the additional phenyl ring of PTPBPTA not only increased the oscillator strength, but also decreased the Stokes shift. TDDFT calculations pointed out facile reverse intersystem crossing processes in PTPTPA from high&#8208;lying triplet states to the singlet excited state. A nondoped device based on PTPTPA as emitter showed impressive performance with EQEmax of 7.11&#8201;% and CIE coordinates of (0.15, 0.09). At the same time, it was also an efficient host for yellow and red phosphorescent OLEDs. By doping yellow (PPYBA) and red (BTPG) phosphorescent dyes into PTPTPA, a white OLED with a high EQE of 23.85&#8201;% was achieved. The successful design of PTPTPA not only provided an optimization choice for OLED emitters, but also demonstrated the empirical rules for the design of multifunctional deep&#8208;blue emitters.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Boron Nitride and Carbon Domains in Boron Carbide Nitride Nanotube Supported Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single metal atoms supported on boron carbide nitride nanotubes are considered as promising electrocatalysts for N2 reduction to NH3 with high activity and selectivity. The outstanding performance is ascribed to the synergistic effect of boron nitride and carbon domains, which tuned the charge polarization of metal&#8208;atom active site and the electronic properties of material.







Abstract
Developing the low&#8208;cost and efficient single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is of great importance while remains as a great challenge. The catalytic activity, selectivity and durability are all fundamentally related to the elaborate coordination environment of SACs. Using first&#8208;principles calculations, we investigated the SACs with single transition metal (TM) atom supported on defective boron carbide nitride nanotubes (BCNTs) as NRR electrocatalysts. Our results suggest that boron&#8208;vacancy defects on BCNTs can strongly immobilize TM atoms with large enough binding energy and high thermal/structural stability. Importantly, the synergistic effect of boron nitride (BN) and carbon domains comes up with the modifications of the charge polarization of single&#8208;TM&#8208;atom active site and the electronic properties of material, which has been proven to be the essential key to promote N2 adsorption, activation, and reduction. Specifically, six SACs (namely V, Mn, Fe, Mo, Ru, and W atoms embedded into defective BCNTs) can be used as promising candidates for NRR electrocatalysts as their NRR activity is higher than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the art Ru(0001) catalyst. In particular, single Mo atom supported on defective BCNTs with large tube diameter possesses the highest NRR activity while suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, with a low limiting potential of &#8722;0.62&#8197;V via associative distal path. This work suggests new opportunities for driving NH3 production by carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts under ambient conditions.

Fit in the groove: Hybrid DNAs with Watson&#8211;Crick and purine&#8211;purine base pairs decorated with dendritic side chains are prepared. Space&#8208;demanding side chains introduced into the 7&#8208;position of 5&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazaguanine&#8211;isoguanine base pairs are well accommodated in the large groove of purine&#8211;purine DNA and have a positive impact on helix stability.







Abstract
The Watson&#8211;Crick coding system depends on the molecular recognition of complementary purine and pyrimidine bases. Now, the construction of hybrid DNAs with Watson&#8211;Crick and purine&#8211;purine base pairs decorated with dendritic side chains was performed. Oligonucleotides with single and multiple incorporations of 5&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyguanosine, its tripropargylamine derivative, and 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyisoguanosine were synthesized.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Watson&#8211;Crick coding system depends on the molecular recognition of complementary purine and pyrimidine bases. Now, the construction of hybrid DNAs with Watson&#8211;Crick and purine&#8211;purine base pairs decorated with dendritic side chains was performed. Oligonucleotides with single and multiple incorporations of 5&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyguanosine, its tripropargylamine derivative, and 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyisoguanosine were synthesized. Duplex stability decreased if single modified purine&#8211;purine base pairs were inserted, but increased if pyrene residues were introduced by click chemistry. A growing number of consecutive 5&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazaguanine&#8211;isoguanine base pairs led to strong stepwise duplex stabilization, a phenomenon not observed for the guanine&#8211;isoguanine base pair. Spacious residues are well accommodated in the large groove of purine&#8211;purine DNA tracts. Changes to the global helical structure monitored by circular dichroism spectroscopy show the impact of functionalization to the global double&#8208;helix structure. This study explores new areas of molecular recognition realized by purine base pairs that are complementary in hydrogen bonding, but not in size, relative to canonical pairs.&lt;/p&gt;

Gold (I)&#8208;catalyzed higher&#8208;order cycloaddition: 8&#8208;Aryl&#8208;8&#8208;azafulvenes undergo a regioselective gold catalyzed [8+2] cycloaddition with electron&#8208;rich allenamines and ynamides to give dihydrocyclohepta[b]pyrrole derivatives. The cyclization takes place after the nucleophilic attack of the heptafulvene to the electrophilic intermediates formed by the coordination of cationic gold to either allene or triple bond moieties of the unsaturated systems.







Abstract
Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed higher&#8208;order [8+2] cycloadditions of 8&#8208;aryl&#8208;8&#8208;azaheptafulvenes 1 with allenamides 2 and ynamides 3 were studied. 1,8&#8208;Dihydrocycloheptapyrroles 4 were achieved by a regioselective [8+2] cycloaddition of azaheptafulvenes 1 and allenamides 2 in the presence of (2,4&#8208;ditBuC6H3O)3PAuNTf2 as catalyst. Besides, ynamides 3 and 8&#8208;aryl&#8208;8&#8208;azaheptafulvenes 1, undergo a regioselective [8+2] cycloaddition, to give 2&#8208;amido&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydrocycloheptapyrroles 7 in the presence of JohnPhosAuNTf2 as catalyst. Both reactions take place with good yields and with a variety of substituents. A plausible mechanism hypothesis suggests a nucleophilic attack of the 8&#8208;azaheptafulvene to the gold activated electron rich allene or alkyne moieties of the allenamide and ynamide, respectively.

The material PTPBTPA is reported in this work, which is shown in blue in the cover picture. It can act as a high&#8208;efficiency deep blue emitter as well as an efficient host material for yellow (the color of the bull in the image) and red (the festive color, indicating the coming of the Spring Festival) phosphors. Combining the blue fluorescence and yellow or red phosphorescence produced high&#8208;performance WOLED, which emits white light as the color of the external circle.

         <title>A DNA&#8208;Encoded Chemical Library Based on Peptide Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library (DEL) based on canonical and non&#8208;canonical peptide macrocycles (YO&#8208;DEL) was generated. The single&#8208;stranded format allowed for selections by affinity capture, through a novel selection method exploiting the competition with an antibody fragment and the annealing to a photoreactive moiety which allowed for selections by a photocrosslinking approach. The YO&#8208;DEL yielded ligands against proteins of pharmaceutical interest such as CAIX, HSA and NKp46, a protein expressed on the surface of activated NK&#8208;cells.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of a novel DNA&#8208;encoded library of macrocyclic peptide derivatives are described; the macrocycles are based on three sets of proteinogenic and non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acid building blocks and featuring the use of copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction for ring closure. The library (termed YO&#8208;DEL) which contains 1&#8201;254&#8201;838 compounds, was encoded with DNA in single&#8208;stranded format and was screened against target proteins of interest using affinity capture procedures and photocrosslinking. YO&#8208;DEL selections yielded specific binders against serum albumins, carbonic anhydrases and NKp46, a marker of activated Natural Killer cells.

         <dc:description>
Two dimensional nanomaterials: An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC, HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC) fabricated from tungsten oxide (m&#8208;WO3) nanoplates as a negative electrode and highly reduced graphene oxide (HRG) as a positive electrode material attains specific capacitance of 389&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with an associated high energy density of 93&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 500&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in a wide 1.6&#8197;V operating potential window. In addition, the HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC displays long&#8208;term cycling&#8208;stability, maintaining around 92&#8201;% of the original specific capacitance after 5000 galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge cycles.







Abstract
Tungsten oxide/graphene hybrid materials are attractive semiconductors for energy&#8208;related applications. Herein, we report an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC, HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC), fabricated from monoclinic tungsten oxide (m&#8208;WO3) nanoplates as a negative electrode and highly reduced graphene oxide (HRG) as a positive electrode material. The supercapacitor performance of the prepared electrodes was evaluated in an aqueous electrolyte (1&#8201;m H2SO4) using three&#8208; and two&#8208;electrode systems. The HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 389&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with an associated high energy density of 93&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 500&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in a wide 1.6&#8197;V operating potential window. In addition, the HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC displays long&#8208;term cycling stability, maintaining 92&#8201;% of the original specific capacitance after 5000 galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge cycles. The m&#8208;WO3 nanoplates were prepared hydrothermally while HRG was synthesized by a modified Hummers method.

The HRG//m&#8208;WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ASC exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 389&#8197;F&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, with an associated high energy density of 93&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a power density of 500&#8197;W&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in a wide 1.6&#8197;V operating potential window. In addition, the HRG//m&#8208;WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ASC displays long&#8208;term cycling stability, maintaining 92&#8201;% of the original specific capacitance after 5000 galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge cycles. The m&#8208;WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoplates were prepared hydrothermally while HRG was synthesized by a modified Hummers method.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Probing Multiconfigurational States by Spectroscopy: The Cerium XAS L3&#8208;edge Puzzle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ce L3 X&#8208;ray absorption spectra of CeO2 and Ce(C8H8)2 are calculated with relativistic multiconfigurational wavefunction approaches. Calculated spectra are in excellent agreement with experiments. The metal oxidation state in the ground vs. the core&#8208;excited states, and the experimental 4f electron count derived spectroscopically, are fully rationalized.







Abstract
The Ce L3 edge XAS spectra of CeO2 and cerocene [Ce(C8H8)2] were calculated with relativistic ab&#8208;initio multireference wavefunction approaches capable of reproducing the observed spectra accurately. The study aims to resolve the decades&#8208;long puzzle regarding the relationship between the number and relative intensities of the XAS peaks and the 4f electron occupation in the ground state (GS) versus the core&#8208;excited states (ESs). CeO2 and cerocene exemplify the different roles of covalent bonding and wavefunction configurational composition in the observed intensity patterns. Good agreement is found between the calculated GS 4f&#8208;shell occupations and the value derived from XAS measurements using peak areas (nf). The identity of the two&#8208;peaked Ce L3 edge is fully rationalized from the perspective of the relaxed wavefunctions for the GS and core ESs. The states underlying the different peaks differ from each other in a surprisingly simple way that can be associated with 4f1 vs. 4f0 sub&#8208;configurations. Furthermore, part of one of the cerocene spectral peaks is associated with 4f2 sub&#8208;configurations. The pattern therefore reveals excited states that can be interpreted in terms of Ce&#8201;IV and III oxidation numbers, as long assumed, with Ce&#8201;II states additionally appearing in the cerocene spectrum. While this work demonstrates the rough accuracy of the conventional approach to determining nf from Ce L3&#8208;edge XAS, limitations are highlighted in terms of the ultimate accuracy of this approach and the potential of observing new types of excited states. The need to determine the sources of nf by calculations, is stressed.

         <title>Fluorinated Rings: Conformation and Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine&#8208;containing compounds are widely used in different applications owing to their unique properties and effects. A particularly interesting feature is the impact of the C&#8722;F bond on the conformational preference when incorporated with organic molecules. In this Review, the conformational behavior of fluorinated aliphatic carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic systems will be discussed through presentation of the most recent applications.







Abstract
The introduction of fluorine atoms into molecules and materials across many fields of academic and industrial research is now commonplace, owing to their unique properties. A particularly interesting feature is the impact of fluorine substitution on the relative orientation of a C&#8722;F bond when incorporated into organic molecules. In this Review, we will be discussing the conformational behavior of fluorinated aliphatic carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic systems. The conformational preference of each system is associated with various interactions introduced by fluorine substitution such as charge&#8208;dipole, dipole&#8208;dipole, and hyperconjugative interactions. The contribution of each interaction on the stabilization of the fluorinated alicyclic system, which manifests itself in low conformations, will be discussed in detail. The novelty of this feature will be demonstrated by presenting the most recent applications.

         <title>Directed Design of a AuI Complex with a Reduced Mesoionic Carbene Radical Ligand: Insights from 1,2,3&#8208;Triazolylidene Selenium Adducts and Extensive Electrochemical Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

MIC drop! The first example and the spectroscopic characterization of a metal&#8208;bound as well as selenium&#8208;bound mesoionic carbene (MIC)&#8208;radical of the 1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene type is reported. Design principles for stabilizing such radicals are presented as well.







Abstract
Carbene&#8208;based radicals are important for both fundamental and applied chemical research. Herein, extensive electrochemical investigations of nine different 1,2,3&#8208;triazolylidene selenium adducts are reported. It is found that the half&#8208;wave potentials of the first reduction of the selones correlate with their calculated LUMO levels and the LUMO levels of the corresponding triazolylidene&#8208;based mesoionic carbenes (MICs). Furthermore, unexpected quasi&#8208;reversibility of the reduction of two triazoline selones, exhibiting comparable reduction potentials, was discovered. Through UV/Vis/NIR and EPR spectroelectrochemical investigations supported by DFT calculations, the radical anion was unambiguously assigned to be triazoline centered. This electrochemical behavior was transferred to a triazolylidene&#8208;type MIC&#8208;gold phenyl complex resulting in a MIC&#8208;radical coordinated AuI species. Apart from UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR and EPR spectroelectrochemical investigations of the reduction, the reduced gold&#8208;coordinated MIC radical complex was also formed in situ in the bulk through chemical reduction. This is the first report of a monodentate triazolylidene&#8208;based MIC ligand that can be reduced to its anion radical in a metal complex. The results presented here provide design principles for stabilizing radicals based on MICs.

         <title>Designed Construction of SrTiO3/SrSO4/Pt Heterojunctions with Boosted Photocatalytic H2 Evolution Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photocatalyst is designed with consideration of heterojunction band matching and porous structure. The SrTiO3/SrSO4 heterojunction using Pt as the co&#8208;catalyst reaches 396.82&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 16&#8197;times higher than that of SrTiO3/Pt. It is proposed that the presence of SrSO4 provides extra channels for electron transportation as well as promoting photocatalytic activity.







Abstract
Efficient separation of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs is a crucial factor for high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. Effective electron&#8211;hole separation and migration could be achieved by heterojunctions with suitable band structures. Herein, a porous SrTiO3/SrSO4 heterojunction is prepared by a sol&#8208;gel method at room temperature followed by an annealing process. XRD characterization suggests high crystallinity of the heterostructure. A well&#8208;defined interface between the two phases is confirmed by high&#8208;resolution (HR)TEM. The photocatalytic H2 evolution productivity of the SrTiO3/SrSO4 heterojunction with Pt as co&#8208;catalyst reaches 396.82&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 16&#8197;times higher than that of SrTiO3/Pt. The boosted photocatalytic activity of SrTiO3/SrSO4/Pt can be ascribed to the presence of SrSO4, which promotes the transfer and migration of photogenerated carriers by forming the heterojunction and porous structure, which provides a large amount of active sites. This novel porous heterostructure brings new ideas for the development of high&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts for H2 release.

         <title>Organic Nanoparticles with Persistent Luminescence for In Vivo Afterglow Imaging&#8208;Guided Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Afterglow organic nanoparticles (ONPs) with long lifetime and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission offered high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and good tissue penetration for afterglow imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) in vivo. Owing to strong afterglow luminescence and abundant singlet oxygen generation from the ONPs upon NIR laser irradiation, they have shown effective suppression of tumor growth after imaging&#8208;guided PDT in mice with minimal damage to major organs.







Abstract
Optical imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT), with precise localization and non&#8208;invasive treatment of tumors, is an emerging technique with great potential for cancer therapy. However, impaired by tissue auto&#8208;fluorescence that causes low signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR), most fluorescence imaging systems show poor sensitivity to tumors in vivo. In this study, we synthesized organic nanoparticles (ONPs) with persistent luminescence and good biocompatibility for afterglow imaging&#8208;guided PDT. The ONPs displayed near&#8208;infrared light emission with half&#8208;life time at minute level, which offered high SBR and good tissue penetration for in vivo afterglow tumor imaging. Taking advantage of their abundant singlet oxygen generation by NIR laser irradiation guided to the tumor sites, the ONPs also enabled imaging&#8208;guided PDT for efficient suppression of tumor growth in mice with minimal damage to major organs.

         <title>Lighting up the plasma membrane: Development and applications of fluorescent ligands for transmembrane proteins.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the fact that transmembrane proteins represent the main therapeutic targets for decades, complete and in&#8208;depth knowledge about their biochemical and pharmacological profiling is not fully available. In this regard, target&#8208;tailored small&#8208;molecule fluorescent ligands are a viable approach to fill in the missing pieces of the puzzle. Such tools, coupled with the ability of high&#8208;precision optical techniques to image with an unprecedented resolution at a single&#8208;molecule level, helped unraveling many of the conundrums related to plasma proteins&#8217; life&#8208;cycle and druggability. Herein, we review the recent progress made during the last two decades in fluorescent ligand design and potential applications in fluorescence microscopy of voltage&#8208;gated ion channels, ligand&#8208;gated ion channels and G&#8208;coupled protein receptors.</dc:description>

         <title>Naphthalenediimides with High Fluorescence Quantum Yield: Bright&#8208;Red, Stable, and Responsive Fluorescent Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of a bis&#8208;NH2 core&#8208;substituted naphthalenediimide (NDI) with remarkably high 
. A simple synthetic protocol to NH2&#8208;substituted NDIs is described. Dependent on the substituents, fluorescence can be tuned from bright&#8208;green to the red/NIR region and the 
 modulated by two orders of magnitude. These fluorophores show large Stokes&#8208;shift and great responsiveness to solvent polarity.







Abstract
The naphthalenediimide (NDI) scaffold in contrast to its higher congeners possess low&#8208;fluorescence. In spite of elegant synthetic developments, a highly emissive NDI is quite rare to find, as well as, a green&#8208;light&#8208;emitting NDI is yet to be explored. Herein, we report a novel class of symmetric and asymmetric NH2&#8208;substituted core&#8208;NDIs (1&#8211;5) with tunable fluorescence in the visible region and extending to the NIR frontier. Importantly, the bis&#8208;NH2&#8208;substituted NDI 2 revealed quantum yield, 
 of &#8776;81 and &#8776;68&#8201;% in toluene and DMSO, respectively, suggesting versatility of the fluorophore in a wide range of solvent polarity. The dye 1 is shown to be the first NDI&#8208;based green&#8208;light emitter. The donor piperidine group in 5 diminish the 
 by 40&#8208;fold providing a lever to modulate the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process. Our synthetic protocol applies a Pd catalyst and a benign hydride source simplifying the non&#8208;trivial &#8722;NH2 group integration at the NDI&#8208;core. TD&#8208;DFT calculations predicted strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds in the excited state in the bulk nonpolar medium and responsiveness to solvent polarity. The maximization of the NDI emission outlined here would further boost the burgeoning repertoire of applications of the NDI scaffold.

         <title>Uranium versus Thorium: Synthesis and Reactivity of [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U[&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2]</title>

         <dc:description>
The intrinsic reactivity of a stable uranium metallacyclopropene complex, [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U(&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2), was evaluated and compared to that of other uranium and thorium metallacyclopropenes. Although structurally similar, the thorium and uranium metallacyclopropenes exhibit distinctively different reactivity.







Abstract
The synthesis, electronic structure, and reactivity of a uranium metallacyclopropene were comprehensively studied. Addition of diphenylacetylene (PhC&#8801;CPh) to the uranium phosphinidene metallocene [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U=P&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;tBu3C6H2 (1) yields the stable uranium metallacyclopropene, [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U[&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2] (2). Based on density functional theory (DFT) results the 5f orbital contributions to the bonding within the metallacyclopropene U&#8208;(&#951;2&#8208;C=C) moiety increases significantly compared to the related ThIV compound [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2Th[&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2], which also results in more covalent bonds between the [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U2+ and [&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2]2&#8722; fragments. Although the thorium and uranium complexes are structurally closely related, different reaction patterns are therefore observed. For example, 2 reacts as a masked synthon for the low&#8208;valent uranium(II) metallocene [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2UII when reacted with Ph2E2 (E=S, Se), alkynes and a variety of hetero&#8208;unsaturated molecules such as imines, ketazine, bipy, nitriles, organic azides, and azo derivatives. In contrast, five&#8208;membered metallaheterocycles are accessible when 2 is treated with isothiocyanate, aldehydes, and ketones.

         <title>Sulfur Tetrahydride and Allied Superhydride Clusters: When Resonance Takes Precedence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H2S + H2 reactants are (computationally) found to form metastable &#8220;superhydride&#8221; SH4 that in turn forms (SH4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H2S)n = &#8220;(SH3)2n&#8221; clusters with well&#8208;adapted (x,y,z) geometry for crystallization. Natural resonance theory (NRT) clarifies the uniqueness of the hypervalent bonding in this species.







Abstract
Sulfur offers a variety of bonding surprises compared to the parent oxygen atom of the chalcogen family. In the present work, we employ standard quantum chemistry methods to characterize formation of previously unrecognized sulfur tetrahydride (C4v&#8208;symmetric SH4) from hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and molecular hydrogen (H2) on the ground state potential energy surface. The unusual intramolecular interactions of SH4 defy Lewis&#8208;like bonding conceptions, exhibiting the dominance of resonance&#8208;type donor&#8208;acceptor delocalizations well beyond those of SF4 (C2v sawhorse geometry) and other known tetrahalides. The distressed character of SH4 bonding also leads to exotic intermolecular structural motifs in clusters of pure (SH4)n and mixed (SH4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H2S)n composition. We evaluate structural, spectroscopic, and electronic properties for various 2D/3D coordination patterns and discuss how (SH4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H2S)n&#8208;type building blocks may relate to recent experimental studies of superconductivity in high&#8208;pressure materials of &#8220;SH3&#8221; stoichiometry.

         <title>Tuning the Properties of MOF&#8208;808 via Defect Engineering and Metal Nanoparticle Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defects and metal nanoparticle encapsulations have been shown to have significant impacts on structure, texture, morphology and reactivity of the synthesized MOFs. Control over defects creation and metal nanoparticle encapsulations can become useful avenues to adjust the properties of MOFs.







Abstract
Defect engineering and metal encapsulation are considered as valuable approaches to fine&#8208;tune the reactivity of metal&#8211;organic frameworks. In this work, various MOF&#8208;808 (Zr) samples are synthesized and characterized with the final aim to understand how defects and/or platinum nanoparticle encapsulation act on the intrinsic and reactive properties of these MOFs. The reactivity of the pristine, defective and Pt encapsulated MOF&#8208;808 is quantified with water adsorption and CO2 adsorption calorimetry. The results reveal strong competitive effects between crystal morphology and missing linker defects which in turn affect the crystal morphology, porosity, stability, and reactivity. In spite of leading to a loss in porosity, the introduction of defects (missing linkers or Pt nanoparticles) is beneficial to the stability of the MOF&#8208;808 towards water and could also be advantageously used to tune adsorption properties of this MOF family.

         <title>Synthetic Approaches to Selenoesters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selenoesters are an important class of compounds that have wide possibilities for chemical transformations, being considered excellent building blocks for the synthesis of more complex molecules. In this review, an overview of the available methods for the synthesis of selenoesters will be presented. This overview is hoped to serve as a source of inspiration for the development of new strategies for the synthesis of this type of compound, as well as for their use as building blocks in synthesis.







Abstract
Selenoesters are compounds of great synthetic relevance since they can be used in several types of chemical transformations and mainly due to their great capacity in the formation of acyl radicals. Therefore, the scientific community has been developing several methods for the synthesis of this class of molecules. This review will address the synthesis of these compounds from different starting materials, such as carboxylic acids derivatives (acid chlorides and anhydrides), aldehydes, selenoacetylenes and miscellaneous methods.

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrasubstituted Arenes by Vicinal Functionalization of Arynes Derived from Aryl(Mes)iodonium Salts**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Densely functionalized 1,2,3,4&#8208;substituted arenes are found in societally important molecules but are challenging to synthesize. This work reports on a method that uses aryl(Mes)iodonium salts as an aryne precursor via regioselective deprotonation. Various arynophiles are used and result in formation of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;Cl, and C&#8722;Si bonds; mechanistic insights from experiments and DFT calculations are provided.







Abstract
Herein, the synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted benzenoid rings, motifs found in pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and natural products, is described.[1] In the past, the regioselective syntheses of such compounds have been a significant challenge. This work reports a method using substituted arynes derived from aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to access a range of densely functionalized 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted benzenoid rings. Significantly, it was found that halide substituents are compatible under these conditions, enabling post&#8208;synthetic elaboration via palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling. This concise strategy is predicated on two regioselective events: 1)&#8197;ortho&#8208; deprotonation of aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to generate a substituted aryne intermediate, and 2)&#8197;regioselective trapping of said arynes, thereby improving previously reported reaction conditions to generate arynes at room temperature and in shorter reaction times. Density functional theory (DFT) computations and linear free energy relationship (LFER) analysis suggest the regioselectivity of deprotonation is influenced by both proximal and distal ring substituents on the aryne precursor. A competition experiment further reveals the role of arene substituents on relative reactivity of aryl(Mes)iodoniums as aryne precursors.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Porous SiFe@C Composite with Excellent Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Threesome is impressive: A novel and scalable strategy for the fabrication of porous SiFe@C composite with mesoporous structure is reported. The conductive phase of FeSi2 is partially retained; together with a uniform carbon layer excellent lithium storage is achieved.







Abstract
Utilizing cost&#8208;effective raw materials to prepare high&#8208;performance silicon&#8208;based anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is both challenging and attractive. Herein, a porous SiFe@C (pSiFe@C) composite derived from low&#8208;cost ferrosilicon is prepared via a scalable three&#8208;step procedure, including ball milling, partial etching, and carbon layer coating. The pSiFe@C material integrates the advantages of the mesoporous structure, the partially retained FeSi2 conductive phase, and a uniform carbon layer (12&#8211;16&#8197;nm), which can substantially alleviate the huge volume expansion effect in the repeated lithium&#8208;ion insertion/extraction processes, effectively stabilizing the solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI) film and markedly enhancing the overall electronic conductivity of the material. Benefiting from the rational structure, the obtained pSiFe@C hybrid material delivers a reversible capacity of 1162.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200&#8197;cycles at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a higher initial coulombic efficiency of 82.30&#8201;%. In addition, it shows large discharge capacities of 803.1 and 600.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 500&#8197;cycles at 2 and 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively, manifesting an excellent electrochemical lithium storage. This work provides a good prospect for the commercial production of silicon&#8208;based anode materials for LIBs with a high lithium&#8208;storage capacity.

In addition, it shows large discharge capacities of 803.1 and 600.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 500&#8197;cycles at 2 and 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, manifesting an excellent electrochemical lithium storage. This work provides a good prospect for the commercial production of silicon&#8208;based anode materials for LIBs with a high lithium&#8208;storage capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Chemical Bonding in Homoleptic Carbonyl Cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Cu, Ag, Au)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donation of an electron pair from the HOMO of [Fe(CO)5]2 to the 4s LUMO of Cu+ giving the (+,+) component of the Fe&#8208;Cu&#8208;Fe &#963; bond in [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2]+. The associated charge flow with the direction red&#8594;blue is given by the deformation density.







Abstract
Syntheses of the copper and gold complexes [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6] and [Au{Fe(CO)5}2][HOB{3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3}3] containing the homoleptic carbonyl cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Cu, Au) are reported. Structural data of the rare, trimetallic Cu2Fe, Ag2Fe and Au2Fe complexes [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6], [Ag{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6] and [Au{Fe(CO)5}2][HOB{3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3}3] are also given. The silver and gold cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Ag, Au) possess a nearly linear Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8217; moiety but the Fe&#8208;Cu&#8208;Fe&#8217; in [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6] exhibits a significant bending angle of 147&#176; due to the strong interaction with the [SbF6]&#8722; anion. The Fe(CO)5 ligands adopt a distorted square&#8208;pyramidal geometry in the cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+, with the basal CO groups inclined towards M. The geometry optimization with DFT methods of the cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Cu, Ag, Au) gives equilibrium structures with linear Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8217; fragments and D2 symmetry for the copper and silver cations and D4d symmetry for the gold cation. There is nearly free rotation of the Fe(CO)5 ligands around the Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8217; axis. The calculated bond dissociation energies for the loss of both Fe(CO)5 ligands from the cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ show the order M=Au (De=137.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1)&gt;Cu (De=109.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1)&gt;Ag (De=92.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). The QTAIM analysis shows bond paths and bond critical points for the M&#8722;Fe linkage but not between M and the CO ligands. The EDA&#8208;NOCV calculations suggest that the [Fe(CO)5]&#8594;M+&#8592;[Fe(CO)5] donation is significantly stronger than the [Fe(CO)5]&#8592;M+&#8594;[Fe(CO)5] backdonation. Inspection of the pairwise orbital interactions identifies four contributions for the charge donation of the Fe(CO)5 ligands into the vacant (n)s and (n)p AOs of M+ and five components for the backdonation from the occupied (n&#8208;1)d AOs of M+ into vacant ligand orbitals.

         <title>Fluorogenic Squaraine Dendrimers for Background&#8208;Free Imaging of Integrin Receptors in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorogenic dendrimer probe for imaging membrane receptors has been developed. It combines eight squaraine dyes that undergo polarity&#8208;dependent aggregation&#8211;disaggregation within the dendrimer, resulting in OFF&#8211;ON fluorescence response to a biomolecular target. It enables integrin&#8208;specific imaging of cancer cells with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio.







Abstract
To overcome the limited brightness of existing fluorogenic molecular probes for biomolecular targets, we introduce a concept of fluorogenic dendrimer probe, which undergoes polarity&#8208;dependent switching due to intramolecular aggregation&#8208;caused quenching of its fluorophores. Based on a rational design of dendrimers with four and eight squaraine dyes, we found that octamer bearing dyes through a sufficiently long PEG(8) linker displays &gt;400&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement from water to non&#8208;polar dioxane. High extinction coefficient (&#8776;2,300,000&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1) resulted from eight squaraine dyes and quantum yield (&#8776;25&#8201;%) make this octamer the brightest environment&#8208;sensitive fluorogenic molecule reported to date. Its conjugate with cyclic RGD used at low concentration (3&#8197;nm) enables integrin&#8208;specific fluorescence imaging of cancer cells with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio. The developed dendrimer probe is a &#8220;golden middle&#8221; between molecular probes and nanoparticles, combining small size, turn&#8208;on response and high brightness, important for bioimaging.

         <title>Specific Ion&#8211;Protein Interactions Influence Bacterial Ice Nucleation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effects of ions on bacterial ice nucleation: Freezing droplet experiments, sum&#8208;frequency generation spectroscopy, and molecular dynamic simulations were used to demonstrate that ions can profoundly influence the efficiency of bacterial ice nucleators in a manner that follows the Hofmeister series. The different effects are due to specific interactions of the ions with ice&#8208;nucleating proteins on the surface of the bacteria.







Abstract
Ice nucleation&#8208;active bacteria are the most efficient ice nucleators known, enabling the crystallization of water at temperatures close to 0&#8201;&#176;C, thereby overcoming the kinetically hindered phase transition process at these conditions. Using highly specialized ice&#8208;nucleating proteins (INPs), they can cause frost damage to plants and influence the formation of clouds and precipitation in the atmosphere. In nature, the bacteria are usually found in aqueous environments containing ions. The impact of ions on bacterial ice nucleation efficiency, however, has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that ions can profoundly influence the efficiency of bacterial ice nucleators in a manner that follows the Hofmeister series. Weakly hydrated ions inhibit bacterial ice nucleation whereas strongly hydrated ions apparently facilitate ice nucleation. Surface&#8208;specific sum&#8208;frequency generation spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the different effects are due to specific interactions of the ions with the INPs on the surface of the bacteria. Our results demonstrate that heterogeneous ice nucleation facilitated by bacteria strongly depends upon the nature of the ions, and specific ion&#8211;protein interactions are essential for the complete description of heterogeneous ice nucleation by bacteria.

Tin cation valency&#8208;dependent morphology evolution of Cu2&#8722;xS nanodisk seeds was initially developed. Subsequent pseudomorphic full/partial cation exchanges with Zn2+ and Cd2+ to produce traditionally inaccessible nanostructures were reported as well.







Abstract
A crucial parameter in the design of semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) with controllable optical, magnetic, electronic, and catalytic properties is the morphology. Herein, we demonstrate the potential of additive metal cations with variable valency to direct the morphology evolution of copper&#8208;deficient Cu2&#8722;xS nanoparticles in the process of seed&#8208;mediated growth. In particular, the djurleite Cu1.94S seed could evolve from disk into tetradecahedron in the presence of tin(IV) cations, whereas they merely formed sharp hexagonal nanodisks with tin(II) cations. In addition to djurleite Cu1.94S, the tin(IV) cations could be generalized to direct the growth of roxbyite Cu1.8S and covellite CuS nanodisk seeds into tetradecahedra. We further perform pseudomorphic cation exchanges of Cu1.94S tetradecahedra with Zn2+ and Cd2+ to produce polyhedral zinc sulfide (ZnS) and cadmium sulfide (CdS) NPs. Moreover, we achieve Cu1.8S/ZnS and Cu1.94S/CdS tetradecahedral heterostructures via partial cation exchange, which are otherwise inaccessible by traditional synthetic approaches.

         <title>Overview of N&#8208;Rich Antennae Investigated in Lanthanide&#8208;Based Temperature Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Noncontact temperature sensors are gaining importance. Lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors stand out as they benefit form for example, high photostability. In this Review, an extensive overview on N&#8208;rich antennae used in lanthanide based temperature sensing is provided. The potential of N&#8208;rich small molecules, bi&#8208;and polynuclear complexes, metal organic frameworks, periodic mesoporous organosilicas and porous organic polymers are discussed.







Abstract
The market share of noncontact temperature sensors is expending due to fast technological and medical evolutions. In the wide variety of noncontact sensors, lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors stand out. They benefit from high photostability, relatively long decay times and high quantum yields. To circumvent their low molar light absorption, the incorporation of a light&#8208;harvesting antenna is required. This Review provides an overview of the nitrogen&#8208;rich antennae in lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors, emitting in the visible light spectrum, and discusses their temperature sensor ability. The N&#8208;rich ligands are incorporated in many different platforms. The investigation of different antennae is required to develop temperature sensors with diverse optical properties and to create a diverse offer for the multiple application fields. Molecular probes, consisting of small molecules, are first discussed. Furthermore, the thermometer properties of ratiometric temperature sensors, based on di&#8208; and polynuclear complexes, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, periodic mesoporous organosilicas and porous organic polymers, are summarized. The antenna mainly determines the application potential of the ratiometric thermometer. It can be observed that molecular probes are operational in the broad physiological range, metal&#8211;organic frameworks are generally very useful in the cryogenic region, periodic mesoporous organosilica show temperature dependency in the physiological range, and porous organic polymers are operative in the cryogenic&#8208;to&#8208;medium temperature range.

         <title>Biological and Medical Applications of Calcium Phosphate Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium phosphate nanoparticles are well suited to transport organic or biological molecules into cells and tissue. They are well tolerated by cells and organisms and have a clearly defined degradation pathway, also due to their almost ubiquitous presence in the body. Promising applications for them are seen in drug and gene delivery and also in immunization, for example, for vaccination. This Review explores the synthesis, characterization, functionalization and biomedical applications of calcium phosphate nanoparticles from the recent literature.







Abstract
Calcium phosphate nanoparticles have a high biocompatibility and biodegradability due to their chemical similarity to human hard tissue, for example, bone and teeth. They can be used as efficient carriers for different kinds of biomolecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, peptides, antibodies, or drugs, which alone are not able to enter cells where their biological effect is required. They can be loaded with cargo molecules by incorporating them, unlike solid nanoparticles, and also by surface functionalization. This offers protection, for example, against nucleases, and the possibility for cell targeting. If such nanoparticles are functionalized with fluorescing dyes, they can be applied for imaging in vitro and in vivo. Synthesis, functionalization and cell uptake mechanisms of calcium phosphate nanoparticles are discussed together with applications in transfection, gene silencing, imaging, immunization, and bone substitution. Biodistribution data of calcium phosphate nanoparticles in vivo are reviewed.

         <title>Engineered Bifunctional Luminescent Pillared&#8208;Layer Frameworks for Adsorption of CO2 and Sensitive Detection of Nitrobenzene in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Space for guests: Five isoreticular luminescent pillared&#8208;layer metal&#8211;organic frameworks showing CO2 uptake and the sensitive detection of nitrobenzene (NB) in aqueous solution are engineered. The NB&#8208;included framework provides direct evidence for framework&#8211;NB interactions.







Abstract
Through a dual&#8208;ligand synthetic approach, five isoreticular primitive cubic (pcu)&#8208;type pillared&#8208;layer metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), [Zn2(dicarboxylate)2(NI&#8208;bpy&#8208;44)]&#8901;x&#8201;DMF&#8901;y&#8201;H2O, in which dicarboxylate=1,4&#8208;bdc (1), Br&#8208;1,4&#8208;bdc (2), NH2&#8208;1,4&#8208;bdc (3), 2,6&#8208;ndc (4), and bpdc (5), have been engineered. MOFs 1&#8211;5 feature twofold degrees of interpenetration and have open pores of 27.0, 33.6, 36.8, 52.5, and 62.1&#8201;%, respectively. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms of activated MOFs 1&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242; at 77&#8197;K all displayed type&#8197;I adsorption behavior, suggesting their microporous nature. Although 1&#8242; and 3&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242; exhibited type&#8197;I adsorption isotherms of CO2 at 195&#8197;K, MOF 2&#8242; showed a two&#8208;step gate&#8208;opening sorption isotherm of CO2. Furthermore, MOF 3&#8242; also had a significant influence of amine functions on CO2 uptake at high temperature due to the CO2&#8211;framework interactions. MOFs 1&#8211;5 revealed solvent&#8208;dependent fluorescence properties; their strong blue&#8208;light emissions in aqueous suspensions were efficiently quenched by trace amounts of nitrobenzene (NB), with limits of detection of 4.54, 5.73, 1.88, 2.30, and 2.26&#8197;&#956;m, respectively, and Stern&#8211;Volmer quenching constants (Ksv) of 2.93&#215;103, 1.79&#215;103, 3.78&#215;103, 4.04&#215;103, and 3.21&#215;103&#8201;m&#8722;1, respectively. Of particular note, the NB&#8208;included framework, NB@3, provided direct evidence of the binding sites, which showed strong host&#8211;guest &#960;&#8211;&#960; and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions beneficial for donor&#8211;acceptor electron transfer and resulting in fluorescence quenching.

         <title>Iron Catalyzed Double Bond Isomerization: Evidence for an FeI/FeIII Catalytic Cycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using deuterium labelling, electrochemistry, EPR and DFT, an iron catalyzed double bond isomerization reaction was disclosed that is likely to proceed through on&#8208;cycle FeI and FeIII intermediates. The reaction uses an FeII pre&#8208;catalyst that undergoes a one&#8208;electron reduction to get to the first on&#8208;cycle species. These studies on mechanism, along with synthetic scope of the reaction, are presented.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;catalyzed isomerization of alkenes is reported using an iron(II) &#946;&#8208;diketiminate pre&#8208;catalyst. The reaction proceeds with a catalytic amount of a hydride source, such as pinacol borane (HBpin) or ammonia borane (H3N&#8901;BH3). Reactivity with both allyl arenes and aliphatic alkenes has been studied. The catalytic mechanism was investigated by a variety of means, including deuteration studies, Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The data obtained support a pre&#8208;catalyst activation step that gives access to an &#951;2&#8208;coordinated alkene FeI complex, followed by oxidative addition of the alkene to give an FeIII intermediate, which then undergoes reductive elimination to allow release of the isomerization product.

     alt="Iron Catalyzed Double Bond Isomerization: Evidence for an FeI/FeIII Catalytic Cycle"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Using deuterium labelling&lt;/b&gt;, electrochemistry, EPR and DFT, an iron catalyzed double bond isomerization reaction was disclosed that is likely to proceed through on&#8208;cycle Fe&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; intermediates. The reaction uses an Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; pre&#8208;catalyst that undergoes a one&#8208;electron reduction to get to the first on&#8208;cycle species. These studies on mechanism, along with synthetic scope of the reaction, are presented.

         <title>Selection of Planar Chiral Conformations between Pillar[5,6]arenes Induced by Amino Acid Derivatives in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

A side&#8208;chain link to chirality: The &#945;&#8208;side chain or ethyl ester moieties of a chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acid ethyl ester hydrochloride were recognized by detecting induced CD signals of WP5 or its homologue WP6. The forces involved in selecting the chiral conformation, such as C (or N)&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions, hydrogen bonds, and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking were illuminated by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acids play critical roles in the metabolic process in nearly all life forms. So far, chiral recognition of &#945;&#8208;amino acids has mainly focused on the determination of l/d enantiomers. Herein, selection of planar chiral conformations between water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene WP5 and pillar[6]arene WP6 was observed due to &#945;&#8208;side chain or ethyl ester moieties of l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid ethyl ester hydrochlorides binding with WP5 and WP6, respectively. Therefore, &#945;&#8208;side chain and ethyl ester moieties of l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid ethyl ester hydrochlorides were recognized by observing the induced CD signal and its inversion. This is a rare example of being able to detect the chiral region around &#945;&#8208;carbon of a chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acid molecule.

         <title>Catalytic Performance of Zr&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Zr&#8208;abtc and MIP&#8208;200 in Selective Oxidations with H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An eight&#8208;connected metal&#8211;organic framework Zr&#8208;abtc catalyzes a range of H2O2&#8208;based selective oxidations. The significant predominance of 1,2&#8208;epoxide in the epoxidation of carvone and high sulfone selectivity in thioether oxidation point to a nucleophilic oxidation mechanism. With highly reactive alkenes, such as caryophyllene, electrophilic oxidation can also be realized.







Abstract
The catalytic performance of Zr&#8208;abtc and MIP&#8208;200 metal&#8211;organic frameworks consisting of 8&#8208;connected Zr6 clusters and tetratopic linkers was investigated in H2O2&#8208;based selective oxidations and compared with that of 12&#8208;coordinated UiO&#8208;66 and UiO&#8208;67. Zr&#8208;abtc demonstrated advantages in both substrate conversion and product selectivity for epoxidation of electron&#8208;deficient C=C bonds in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. The significant predominance of 1,2&#8208;epoxide in carvone epoxidation, coupled with high sulfone selectivity in thioether oxidation, points to a nucleophilic oxidation mechanism over Zr&#8208;abtc. The superior catalytic performance in the epoxidation of unsaturated ketones correlates with a larger amount of weak basic sites in Zr&#8208;abtc. Electrophilic activation of H2O2 can also be realized, as evidenced by the high activity of Zr&#8208;abtc in epoxidation of the electron&#8208;rich C=C bond in caryophyllene. XRD and FTIR studies confirmed the retention of the Zr&#8208;abtc structure after the catalysis. The low activity of MIP&#8208;200 in H2O2&#8208;based oxidations is most likely related to its specific hydrophilicity, which disfavors adsorption of organic substrates and H2O2.

         <title>New Noncentrosymmetric Tetrel Pnictides Composed of Square&#8208;Planar Gold(I) with Peculiar Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bonding natures: Compared with common types of AuI coordination observed in extended solids, square&#8208;planar coordination is rare. Au(I)relia shows off the three&#8208;centered bonding of Au&#8722;Tt&#8722;Au and Au&#8722;Pn&#8722;Au (on her feathers; Tt=tetrel, Pn=pnictogen), square&#8208;planar cis&#8208;[AuTt2Pn2] units (her body), and linear chains of Au (her legs) that are characteristic of equiatomic AuSiAs, AuGeP, and AuGeAs compounds.







Abstract
Three novel isostructural equiatomic gold tetrel pnictides, AuSiAs, AuGeP, and AuGeAs, were synthesized and characterized. These phases crystallize in the noncentrosymmetric (NCS) monoclinic space group Cc (no. 9), featuring square&#8208;planar Au within cis&#8208;[AuTt2Pn2] units (Tt=tetrel, Si, Ge; Pn=pnictogen, P, As). This is in drastic contrast to the structure of previously reported AuSiP, which exhibits typical linear coordination of Au with Si and P. Chemical bonding analysis through the electron localization function suggests covalent two&#8208;center two&#8208;electron Tt&#8722;Pn bonds, and three&#8208;center Au&#8722;Tt&#8722;Au and Au&#8722;Pn&#8722;Au bonds with 1.6&#8197;e&#8722; per bond. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies support the covalent and nonionic nature of Au&#8722;Pn and Au&#8722;Tt bonds. The title materials were found to be n&#8208;type narrow&#8208;gap semiconductors or semimetals, with nearly temperature&#8208;independent electrical resistivities and low thermal conductivities. A combination of the semimetallic properties with tunable NCS structure provides opportunities for the development of materials based on gold tetrel pnictides.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Achiral Metal&#8211;Organic Colloids and Guest Molecules in a Vortex Field</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spinning around: Two metal&#8211;organic colloids based on achiral starting materials show active CD and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties in a vortex field. The optical properties of the colloids can be transferred to achiral Rhodamine derivatives, with glum 10&#8722;2 in magnitude and quantum yields of 40&#8211;83&#8201;%.







Abstract
Recently, scientists have reported a range of chiral fluorescence materials or chiral composites that can emit circularly polarized luminescence. Herein, two achiral metal&#8211;organic colloidal solutions were studied, showing active circularly polarized luminescence, which is observed in vortex stirring. The absolute values for glum are 0.05 and 0.03 and the plus or minus sign of glum depends on the colloidal structure and stirring direction, which make the property easy to manipulate. Further, the host&#8211;guest interaction study suggests both electrostatic interactions and coordination bonding may influence the chiroptical property from the colloidal solution to the guest molecule. Rhodamine 6G and its carboxylic acid derivative exhibit good quantum yields and acceptable glum values in the colloidal solution.

Herein, two achiral metal&#8211;organic colloidal solutions were studied, showing active circularly polarized luminescence, which is observed in vortex stirring. The absolute values for &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; are 0.05 and 0.03 and the plus or minus sign of &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; depends on the colloidal structure and stirring direction, which make the property easy to manipulate. Further, the host&#8211;guest interaction study suggests both electrostatic interactions and coordination bonding may influence the chiroptical property from the colloidal solution to the guest molecule. Rhodamine 6G and its carboxylic acid derivative exhibit good quantum yields and acceptable &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; values in the colloidal solution.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Altered Membrane Mechanics Provides a Receptor&#8208;Independent Pathway for Serotonin Action</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is known that serotonin binds to lipid membranes with high affinity, but what does it do to it? We find that it makes artificial lipid bilayers softer and easier to indent by an AFM tip (top), and promotes disorder in ordered regions. For cell membranes, this effect facilitates increased endocytosis (bottom). This increase occurs even when the serotonin receptors are blocked, providing a receptor&#8208;independent pathway for serotonin action.







Abstract
Serotonin, an important signaling molecule in humans, has an unexpectedly high lipid membrane affinity. The significance of this finding has evoked considerable speculation. Here we show that membrane binding by serotonin can directly modulate membrane properties and cellular function, providing an activity pathway completely independent of serotonin receptors. Atomic force microscopy shows that serotonin makes artificial lipid bilayers softer, and induces nucleation of liquid disordered domains inside the raft&#8208;like liquid&#8208;ordered domains. Solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy corroborates this data at the atomic level, revealing a homogeneous decrease in the order parameter of the lipid chains in the presence of serotonin. In the RN46A immortalized serotonergic neuronal cell line, extracellular serotonin enhances transferrin receptor endocytosis, even in the presence of broad&#8208;spectrum serotonin receptor and transporter inhibitors. Similarly, it increases the membrane binding and internalization of oligomeric peptides. Our results uncover a mode of serotonin&#8211;membrane interaction that can potentiate key cellular processes in a receptor&#8208;independent fashion.

         <title>Multiply Charged Helium Droplet Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charged droplets: The detection of multiply charged helium droplet anions is reported for the first time. By ionizing droplets of superfluid helium with low energy electrons (up to 25&#8197;eV), it was possible to produce droplets containing up to five negative charges, which remain intact on the timescale of the experiment.







Abstract
The detection of multiply charged helium droplet anions is reported for the first time. By ionizing droplets of superfluid helium with low energy electrons (up to 25&#8197;eV), it was possible to produce droplets containing up to five negative charges, which remain intact on the timescale of the experiment. The appearance sizes for different charge states are determined and are found to be orders of magnitude larger than for the equivalent cationic droplets, starting at 4 million He atoms for dianions. Droplets with He*&#8722; as charge carriers show signs of being metastable, but this effect is quenched by the pickup of water molecules.

         <title>Characterization of the Simplest Thiolimine: The Higher Energy Tautomer of Thioformamide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Keep it simple! Thioamides resemble viable prebiotic building blocks for biologically relevant molecules. However, only a handful of experimental reports on parent thioformamide exist. X&#8208;ray diffraction data of thioformamide are reported and its tautomerization induced by UV irradiation under cryogenic conditions is presented. Four conformers of the corresponding thiolimine form, whose (tunneling) reactivity is investigated.







Abstract
As sulfur&#8208;containing organic molecules thioamides and their isomers are conceivable intermediates in prebiotic chemistry, for example, in the formation of amino acids and thiazoles and resemble viable candidates for detection in interstellar media. Here, we report the characterization of parent thioformamide in the solid state via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and its photochemical interconversion to its hitherto unreported higher energy tautomer thiolimine in inert argon and dinitrogen matrices. Upon photogeneration, four conformers of thiolimine form, whose ratio depends on the employed wavelength. One of these conformers interconverts due to quantum mechanical tunneling with a half&#8208;life of 30&#8211;45&#8197;min in both matrix materials at 3 and 20&#8197;K. A spontaneous reverse reaction from thiolimine to thioformamide is not observed. To support our experimental findings, we explored the potential energy surface of the system at the AE&#8208;CCSD(T)/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pCVTZ level of theory and computed tunneling half&#8208;lives with the CVT/SCT approach applying DFT methods.

         <title>Tunable Anticancer Activity of Furoylthiourea&#8208;Based RuII&#8211;Arene Complexes and Their Mechanism of Action</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multitasking! Fourteen new Ru&#8211;arene (p&#8208;cymene or benzene) complexes bearing different furoylthiourea ligands have been synthesized and characterized. All the complexes were found to be highly toxic towards IMR&#8208;32 cancer cells. The complexes catalytically oxidized glutathione and promoted cell death by apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. They also showed good binding ability with receptors commonly overexpressed in cancer cells.







Abstract
Fourteen new RuII&#8211;arene (p&#8208;cymene/benzene) complexes (C1&#8211;C14) have been synthesized by varying the N&#8208;terminal substituent in the furoylthiourea ligand and satisfactorily characterized by using analytical and spectroscopic techniques. Electrostatic potential maps predicted that the electronic effect of the substituents was mostly localized, with some influence seen on the labile chloride ligands. The structure&#8211;activity relationships of the Ru&#8211;p&#8208;cymene and Ru&#8211;benzene complexes showed opposite trends. All the complexes were found to be highly toxic towards IMR&#8208;32 cancer cells, with C5 (Ru&#8211;p&#8208;cymene complex containing C6H2(CH3)3 as N&#8208;terminal substituent) and C13 (Ru&#8211;benzene complex containing C6H4(CF3) as N&#8208;terminal substituent) showing the highest activity among each set of complexes, and hence they were chosen for further study. These complexes showed different behavior in aqueous solutions, and were also found to catalytically oxidize glutathione. They also promoted cell death by apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, the complexes showed good binding ability with the receptors Pim&#8208;1 kinase and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, commonly overexpressed in cancer cells.

         <title>Novel Ferrocene&#8208;Appended &#946;&#8208;Ketoimines and Related BF2 Derivatives with Significant Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission and Second&#8208;Order Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong candidates! The synthesis and structural characterization of ferrocene&#8208;appended &#946;&#8208;ketoimines and their BF2 complexes is reported. A study of their photophysical properties revealed that both the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines and their BF2 complexes show aggregation&#8208;induced emission and a strong second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) response, and thus are excellent multifunctional candidates for NLO and luminescence applications.







Abstract
A series of new &#946;&#8208;ketoimines containing a ferrocene moiety and their BF2 complexes have been synthesized and structurally characterized. The solvatochromism of the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines was studied, putting in evidence a redshift with increasing solvent polarity. This positive solvatochromism can be attributed to a more polarized excited state compared with the ground state, due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions. The &#946;&#8208;ketoimines exhibited weak emission, attributable to the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) phenomenon. This ESIPT effect is suppressed upon restriction of the keto&#8208;enamine tautomerism, induced upon addition of BF3&#8901;OEt2, which afforded the related BF2 complexes, characterized by an enhancement of the fluorescence through the ICT effect. Both the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines and BF2 complexes exhibited significant aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior in mixtures of CH3CN/H2O, due to restriction of intramolecular rotation in the aggregated state. The frontier molecular orbital levels, ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state dipole moments (&#956;g and &#956;e), and the origin of electronic absorption spectra were studied by time&#8208;dependent DFT calculations. The second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties were determined by the electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced second&#8208;harmonic generation technique. The &#956;&#946;1907 values of the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines increased upon the formation of the related BF2 complexes, mainly due to an enhancement of the ground&#8208;state dipole moment.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Strong candidates&lt;/b&gt;! The synthesis and structural characterization of ferrocene&#8208;appended &#946;&#8208;ketoimines and their BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; complexes is reported. A study of their photophysical properties revealed that both the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines and their BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; complexes show aggregation&#8208;induced emission and a strong second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) response, and thus are excellent multifunctional candidates for NLO and luminescence applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of new &#946;&#8208;ketoimines containing a ferrocene moiety and their BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; complexes have been synthesized and structurally characterized. The solvatochromism of the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines was studied, putting in evidence a redshift with increasing solvent polarity. This positive solvatochromism can be attributed to a more polarized excited state compared with the ground state, due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions. The &#946;&#8208;ketoimines exhibited weak emission, attributable to the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) phenomenon. This ESIPT effect is suppressed upon restriction of the keto&#8208;enamine tautomerism, induced upon addition of BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;OEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which afforded the related BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; complexes, characterized by an enhancement of the fluorescence through the ICT effect. Both the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines and BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; complexes exhibited significant aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior in mixtures of CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, due to restriction of intramolecular rotation in the aggregated state. The frontier molecular orbital levels, ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state dipole moments (&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;), and the origin of electronic absorption spectra were studied by time&#8208;dependent DFT calculations. The second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties were determined by the electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced second&#8208;harmonic generation technique. The &lt;i&gt;&#956;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1907&lt;/sub&gt; values of the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines increased upon the formation of the related BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; complexes, mainly due to an enhancement of the ground&#8208;state dipole moment. The results presented here reveal that some of these novel compounds are excellent multifunctional candidates for NLO and luminescence applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Controlling Emissive Properties by Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonds: Alkyl and Aryl meso&#8208;Substituted Porphycenes</title>

Abstract
Porphycene, a porphyrin isomer, is an efficient fluorophore. However, four&#8208;fold meso substitution with alkyl groups decreases the fluorescence quantum yield by orders of magnitude. For aryl substituents, this effect is small. To explain this difference, we have synthesized and studied a mixed aryl&#8208;alkyl&#8208;substituted compound, 9,20&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;10,19&#8208;dimethylporphycene, as well as the 9,20&#8208;diphenyl and 9,20&#8208;dimethyl derivatives. Analysis of the structural, spectroscopic, and photophysical data of the six porphycenes, combined with quantum chemical calculations, shows a clear correlation between the strength of the intramolecular NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bonds and the efficiency of the radiationless depopulation of the lowest&#8208;excited singlet state. This result led us to propose a model in which the delocalization of the inner protons in the cavity of the macrocycle is responsible for the nonradiative deactivation channel. The applicability of the model is confirmed by the literature data for other alkyl&#8208; or aryl&#8208;substituted porphycenes. The finding of a correlation between structural and emissive characteristics enables a rational design of porphycenes with desired photophysical properties.

Abstract
We report on the results of an in&#8197;situ synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction study of the crystallisation in aqueous medium of two recently discovered perfluorinated CeIV&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), analogues of the already well investigated ZrIV&#8208;based UiO&#8208;66 and MIL&#8208;140A, namely, F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce) and F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce). The two MOFs were originally obtained in pure form in similar conditions, using ammonium cerium nitrate and tetrafluoroterephthalic acid as reagents, and small variations of the reaction parameters were found to yield mixed phases. Here, we investigate the crystallisation of these compounds, varying parameters such as temperature, amount of the protonation modulator nitric acid and amount of the coordination modulator acetic acid. When only HNO3 is present in the reaction environment, only F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce) is obtained. Heating preferentially accelerates nucleation, which becomes rate determining below 57&#8201;&#176;C. Upon addition of AcOH to the system, alongside HNO3, mixed&#8208;phased products are obtained. F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce) is always formed faster, and no interconversion between the two phases occurs. In the case of F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce), crystal growth is always the rate&#8208;determining step. A higher amount of HNO3 favours the formation of F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce), whereas increasing the amount of AcOH favours the formation of F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce). Based on the in&#8197;situ results, a new optimised route to achieving a pure, high&#8208;quality F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce) phase in mild conditions (60&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8197;h) is also identified.

Abstract
The so far missing parent compound of the large family of pentaphosphaferrocenes [CpFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (1&#8201;b) was synthesized by the thermolysis of [CpFe(CO)2]2 with P4 using the very high&#8208;boiling solvent diisopropylbenzene. It was comprehensively characterized by, inter alia, NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis, cyclic voltammetry and DFT computations. Moreover, its coordination behavior towards CuI halides was explored, revealing the unprecedented 2D polymeric networks [{CpFe(&#951;5:1:1:1:1&#8208;P5)}Cu2(&#956;&#8208;X)2]n (2&#8201;a: X=Cl, 2&#8201;b: X=Br) and [{CpFe(&#951;5:1:1&#8208;P5)}Cu(&#956;&#8208;I)]n (3) and even the first cyclo&#8208;P5&#8208;containing 3D coordination polymer [{CpFe(&#951;5:1:1&#8208;P5)}Cu(&#956;&#8208;I)]n (4). The sandwich complex&#8197;1&#8201;b can also be incorporated in nano&#8208;sized supramolecules based on [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (1&#8201;a) and CuX (X=Cl, Br, I): [CpFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)]@[{Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)}12(CuX)20&#8208;n] (5&#8201;a: X=Cl, n=2.4; 5&#8201;b: X=Br, n=2.4; 5&#8201;c: X=I, n=0.95). Thereby, the formation of the CuI&#8208;containing fullerene&#8208;like sphere 5&#8201;c is found for the first time.

&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) and even the first &lt;i&gt;cyclo&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;containing 3D coordination polymer [{CpFe(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5:1:1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)}Cu(&#956;&#8208;I)]&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;). The sandwich complex&#8197;&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; can also be incorporated in nano&#8208;sized supramolecules based on [Cp*Fe(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)] (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;) and CuX (X=Cl, Br, I): [CpFe(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)]@[{Cp*Fe(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)}&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;(CuX)&lt;sub&gt;20&#8208;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;5&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;: X=Cl, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=2.4; &lt;b&gt;5&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;: X=Br, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=2.4; &lt;b&gt;5&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt;: X=I, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=0.95). Thereby, the formation of the CuI&#8208;containing fullerene&#8208;like sphere &lt;b&gt;5&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt; is found for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Hydrogenation of secondary amides using phosphane oxide and frustrated Lewis pair catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metal&#8208;free catalytic hydrogenation of secondary carboxylic acid amides is developed. The reduction is realized by two new catalytic reactions. First, the amide is converted into the imidoyl chloride by triphosgene (CO(OCCl3)2) using novel phosphorus(V) catalysts. Second, the in situ generated imidoyl chlorides are hydrogenated in high yields by an FLP&#8208;catalyst. Mechanistic and quantum mechanical calculations support an autoinduced catalytic cycle for the hydrogenation with chloride acting as unusual Lewis base for FLP&#8208;mediated H2&#8208;activation.</dc:description>
