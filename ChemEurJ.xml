         <title>Visible&#8208;light Augmented Lithium Storage Capacity in a Ruthenium(II) Photosensitizer Conjugated with a dione&#8208;catechol Redox Couple</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling redox activity of judiciously appended redox units on a photo&#8208;sensitive molecular core is an effective strategy for visible light energy harvesting and storage. The first example of a photosensitizer &#8208; electron donor coordination compound in which the photoinduced electron transfer step is used for light to electrical energy conversion and storage is reported. A photo&#8208;responsive Ru&#8208;diimine module conjugated with redox&#8208;active catechol groups in [Ru(II)(phenanthroline&#8208;5,6&#8208;diolate)  3  ]  4&#8208;  photosensitizer can mediate photoinduced catechol to dione oxidation in the presence of a sacrificial electron acceptor or at the surface of an electrode. Under potentiostatic condition, visible light triggered current density enhancement confirmed the light harvesting ability of this photosensitizer. Upon implementation in galvanostatic charge&#8208;discharge of a Li battery configuration, the storage capacity was found to be increased by 100%, under 470 nm illumination with output power of 4.0 mW/cm  &#8208;2  . This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept molecular system marks an important milestone towards new generation of molecular photo&#8208;rechargeable materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Behaviour and Chemical Species of Sm(II) in AlCl3&#8208;NaCl with Different Lewis Acidity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>AlCl3&#8208;NaCl was utilized as an electrolyte in this work due to its low melting point and Lewis acidity, in which samarium exists in two oxidation states, Sm(III) and Sm(II), resulting in unique electrochemical behaviours. Sm metal dissolves in AlCl3&#8208;NaCl melt to form SmCl2, which is verified by electrochemical and spectroscopic techniques. As the Lewis acidity of the melt increases, the diffusion coefficient of Sm(II) gradually increases, and the activation energy of diffusion decreases. Moreover, an additional co&#8208;reduction peak of Sm3+ and AlCl4&#8208; is observed to be more positive than that of Al(0)/Al(III) in Lewis basic melt, which may be tightly correlated with the variation of Sm(II) coordination in AlCl3&#8208;NaCl melt and ligand variation from Cl&#8208; to AlCl4&#8208; and Al2Cl7&#8208; as the Lewis acidity of the AlCl3&#8208;NaCl melt increases, according to the in&#8208;situ electronic absorption spectra of Sm in this melt.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Detergent Expansion Strategy for Membrane Protein Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Detergents are the most frequently applied reagents in membrane protein (MP) studies. The limited diversity of one&#8208;head&#8208;one&#8208;tailed traditional detergents however, is far from sufficient for structurally distinct MPs. Expansion of detergent repertoire has a continuous momentum. In line with the speculation that detergent pre&#8208;assembly exerts superiority, herein we for the first time report cross&#8208;conjugation of two series of monomeric detergents for constructing a two&#8208;dimensional library of dimeric detergents. Optimum detergents stood out with unique preferences in the systematic evaluation of individual MPs. Furthermore, unprecedented hybrid detergents 14M8G and 14M9G enabled high&#8208;quality EM study of transporter MsbA and NMR study of G protein&#8208;coupled receptor A  2A  AR, respectively. Given the abundance of cross&#8208;coupling chemistries, comprehensive diversity could be readily covered that would facilitate the finding of new detergents for the manipulation of thorny MPs and innovation of the functional and structural study in future.</dc:description>

         <title>Emerging trends in fluorescence bioimaging of divalent metal cations using small&#8208;molecule indicators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visualization of cation dynamics inside living system represent a major breakthrough at the crossroad of chemistry and cellular physiology. Since the inception of BAPTA&#8208;based cellular calcium indicators in the 1980s, generations of chemical and genetically encoded ion indicators spanning the visible spectrum have been developed. In this article, we bring up three emerging concepts in this field: 1. red&#8208;shifting cation indicators towards far&#8208;red and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) channels; 2. directing the indicators to various subcellular localizations; 3. lowering the phototoxicity of indicators for long term recording. These initiatives collectively echo the advocate of 4D cellular physiology, where biological processes within living systems can be panoramically unveiled under 3D, long&#8208;term, and multi&#8208;channel imaging with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. This outlook, in our opinion, poses exciting challenges and opportunities for chemists to upgrade the toolkit of fluorescent indicators as key enablers for the new era of imageomics.</dc:description>

         <title>The Unexpected Helical Supramolecular Assembly of a Simple Achiral Acetamide Tecton Generates Selective Water Channels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Hydrated HNDPA is a highly robust example of chiral symmetry breaking, which is an extremely rare phenomenon.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202200383).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue is the collaborative research team coordinated by Arie van&#8197;der&#8197;Lee at the University of Montpellier. The image depicts chiral channels with highly mobile water molecules resulting from the robust self&#8208;organization of a simple achiral acetamide. Fully reversible release and re&#8208;uptake of water molecules takes place near ambient conditions, with efficient water transport and a good selectivity against NaCl suggesting it to be an efficient candidate for desalination processes.

         <title>A Series of Rare&#8208;Earth Mesoionic Carbene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generality of employing N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins in the synthesis of mesoionic carbene (MIC) complexes has been shown here with the advent of twelve new f&#8208;block and rare&#8208;earth metal MIC complexes, expanding the library of f&#8208;block and rare&#8208;earth MIC complexes from four to now sixteen in total. Structural, spectroscopic, and computational characterisation data suggest the presence of a solely &#963;&#8208;component to the M&#8722;Ccarbene bonding interaction, whilst magnetic studies highlight that two of the MIC complexes are field&#8208;induced single&#8201;molecule magnets (SMMs).







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterisation of a series of rare&#8208;earth mesoionic carbene complexes, [RE{N(SiMe3)2}3{CN(Me)C(Me)N(Me)CH}] (3RE, RE=Sc, Ce, Pr, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, and Lu), greatly expanding the limited library of f&#8208;block mesoionic carbene complexes. These complexes were prepared by treatment of the parent RE&#8208;triamides with an N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO), where an NHO backbone proton undergoes a formal 1,4&#8208;proton migration to the NHO&#8208;methylene group. For all RE(III) metals, as expected, quantum chemical calculations suggest only a &#963;&#8208;component to the metal&#8722;carbene bonding, in contrast to a previously reported uranium(III) congener where the 5f3 metal engages in a weak &#960;&#8208;back&#8208;bond to the MIC. All complexes were characterised by static variable&#8208;temperature magnetic measurements, and dynamic magnetic measurements reveal that 3Dy and 3Er are field&#8208;induced single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs), with Ueff energy barriers of 35 and 128&#8197;K, respectively. Complex 3Dy is, as expected, a poorly performing SMM, but conversely 3Er performs unexpectedly well.

&lt;b&gt;-heterocyclic olefins&lt;/b&gt; in the synthesis of mesoionic carbene (MIC) complexes has been shown here with the advent of twelve new f-block and rare-earth metal MIC complexes, expanding the library of f-block and rare-earth MIC complexes from four to now sixteen in total. Structural, spectroscopic, and computational characterisation data suggest the presence of a solely &#963;-component to the M&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;carbene&lt;/sub&gt; bonding interaction, whilst magnetic studies highlight that two of the MIC complexes are field-induced single&#8201;molecule magnets (SMMs).

         <title>Enantioselective Amination of &#946;&#8208;Keto Esters Catalyzed by Chiral Calcium Phosphates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral 2&#8208;aminoindane derivatives are a relatively common structural motif found in natural products and pharmaceutical molecules. Hence its highly desirable to develop efficient synthetic methods for enantioselective amination of &#946;&#8208;keto esters. A non&#8208;toxic chiral calcium phosphate&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective amination of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters with dibenzyl azodicarboxylate has been developed, generating chiral &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoester derivatives in good yields and moderate to excellent enantioselectivities under mild conditions.







Abstract
A catalytic enantioselective amination of &#946;&#8208;keto esters using (S)&#8208;BINOL chiral calcium phosphate has been developed. The reaction produces chiral &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto ester derivatives in most cases with moderate to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;%) and good yields (up to 99&#8201;%). This mild synthetic method highlights a low catalyst loading and high catalytic efficiency. When the substrate backbone was changed to 1&#8208;tetralone&#8208;derived &#946;&#8208;keto esters, unexpectedly high yields of selective redox products were obtained. The practicality of the reaction was realized by a scale&#8208;up without any significant loss in the enantioselectivity and yield. Chiral calcium phosphate was successfully recovered and reused for four runs, indicating its stability and high catalytic activity.

         <title>Influence of the Linker Chemistry on the Photoinduced Charge&#8208;Transfer Dynamics of Hetero&#8208;dinuclear Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hitting the bottleneck: For light&#8208;driven catalysis, either the first or second electron transfer or the actual catalytic turnover is the bottleneck, of which the second process is rarely studied. Here, the charge&#8208;transfer dynamics in photoexcited intermediates of a molecular photocatalyst are investigated by spectro&#8208;electrochemistry to understand the overall process and to identify deactivation channels determining the photocatalysts fate.







Abstract
To optimize light&#8208;driven catalytic processes, light&#8208;mediated multi&#8208;electron transfer dynamics in molecular dyads need to be studied and correlated with structural changes focusing on the catalytically active metastable intermediates. Here, spectro&#8208;electrochemistry has been employed to investigate the structure&#8208;dependent photoelectron transfer kinetics in catalytically active intermediates of two Ru&#8722;Rh catalysts for light&#8208;driven NAD+ reduction. The excited&#8208;state reactivity of short&#8208;lived intermediates was studied along different photoreaction pathways by resonance Raman and time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectro&#8208;electrochemistry with sub&#8208;picosecond time resolution under operando conditions. The results demonstrate, for the first time, how the bridging ligand serves as a (multi&#8208;)electron storage structure, mediates the strength of the electronic coupling of catalytic and photocenter and impacts the targeted electron transfer as well as parasitic electron&#8208;transfer kinetics.

         <title>Red Light&#8208;Emitting Thermally&#8208;Activated Delayed Fluorescence of Naphthalimide&#8208;Phenoxazine Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyad: Time&#8208;Resolved Optical and Magnetic Spectroscopic Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The locally&#8208;excited triplet state (3LE) is found as an essential intermediate state in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) of compact electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor system. 3LE and charge&#8208;separated states (1CS and 3CS) are close to each other in energy, the interaction of three states causes TADF, which is analyzed by femtosecond/nanosecond transient absorption spectra and time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.







Abstract
We prepared an orthogonal compact electron&#8208;donor (phenoxazine, PXZ)&#8208;acceptor (naphthalimide, NI) dyad (NI&#8208;PXZ), to study the photophysics of the thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), which has a luminescence lifetime of 16.4&#8197;ns (99.2&#8201;%)/17.0&#8197;&#956;s (0.80&#8201;%). A weak charge transfer (CT) absorption band was observed for the dyad, indicating non&#8208;negligible electronic coupling between the donor and acceptor at the ground state. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy shows a fast charge separation (CS) (ca. 2.02&#8764;2.72&#8197;ps), the majority of the singlet CS state is short&#8208;lived, especially in polar solvents (&#964;CR = 10.3&#8197;ps in acetonitrile, vs. 1.83&#8197;ns in toluene, 7.81&#8197;ns in n&#8208;hexane). Nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy detects a long&#8208;lived transient species in n&#8208;hexane, which is with a mixed triplet local excited state (3LE) and charge separated state (3CS), the lifetime is 15.4&#8197;&#956;s. In polar solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran and acetonitrile, a neat 3CS state was observed, whose lifetimes are 226&#8197;ns and 142&#8197;ns, respectively. Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra indicate the existence of strongly spin exchanged 3LE/3CT states, with the effective zero field splitting (ZFS) |D| and |E| parameters of 1484&#8197;MHz and 109&#8197;MHz, respectively, much smaller than that of the native 3NI state (2475 and 135&#8197;MHz). It is rare but solid experimental evidence that a closely&#8208;lying 3LE state is crucial for occurrence of TADF and this 3LE state is an essential intermediate state to facilitate reverse intersystem crossing in TADF systems.

The obtained glycoprotein was successfully transported to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus of living cells.







Abstract
Glycosylation of proteins is known to be essential for changing biological activity and stability of glycoproteins on the cell surfaces and in body fluids. Delivering of homogeneous glycoproteins into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus would enable us to investigate the function of asparagine&#8208;linked (N&#8208;) glycans in the organelles. In this work, we designed and synthesized an intentionally glycosylated cholera toxin B&#8208;subunit (CTB) to be transported to the organelles of mammalian cells. The heptasaccharide, the intermediate structure of various complex&#8208;type N&#8208;glycans, was introduced to the CTB. The synthesized monomeric glycosyl&#8208;CTB successfully entered mammalian cells and was transported to the Golgi and the ER, suggesting the potential use of synthetic CTB to deliver and investigate the functions of homogeneous N&#8208;glycans in specific organelles of living cells.

         <title>Near Infared Circularly Polarized Luminescence From Water Stable Organic Nanoparticles Containing a Chiral Yb(III) Complex</title>

Unprecedented NIR CPL activity in water from a hydrophobic chiral Yb(III) complex embedded in PLGA nanoparticles was observed







Abstract
We report the first example of very efficient NIR Circularly Polarized Luminescence (CPL) (around 970&#8197;nm) in water, obtained thanks to the combined use of a chiral Yb complex and of poly lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles. [YbL(tta)2]CH3COO (L=N, N&#8217;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethylidene)&#8208;1,2&#8208;(R,R+S,S) cyclohexanediamine and tta=2&#8208;thenoyltrifluoroacetonate) shows good CPL in organic solvents, because the tta ligands efficiently sensitize Yb NIR luminescence and the readily prepared chiral ligand L endows the complex with the necessary dissymmetry. PLGA nanoparticles incorporate the complex and protect the metal ion from the intrusion of solvent molecules, while ensuring biocompatibility, water solubility and stability to the complex. Hydrophilic NIR&#8208;CPL optical probes can find applications in the field of NIR&#8208;CPL bio&#8208;assays.

         <title>Chiral Fibers Formation Upon Assembly of Tetraphenylalanine Peptide Conjugated to a PNA Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetraphenylalanine peptide (4F) conjugated to the PNA dimer &#8220;at&#8221; self&#8208;assembles to produce helical fibers. Interactions between both components of the conjugate, either the peptide and the nucleobases, trigger self&#8208;assembly. Antiparallel beta sheets between the peptides are zipped by hydrogen bonds between complementary nucleobases. Spectroscopic measurements, microscopy data along with a computational model support this hypothesis. On the contrary, when &#8220;at&#8221; is replaced by &#8220;gc&#8221; PNA, odd shaped spheroid are obtained.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of biomolecules such as peptides, nucleic acids or their analogues affords supramolecular objects, exhibiting structures and physical properties dependent on the amino&#8208;acid or nucleobase composition. Conjugation of the peptide diphenylalanine (FF) to peptide nucleic acids triggers formation of self&#8208;assembled structures, mainly stabilized by interactions between FF. In this work we report formation of homogeneous chiral fibers upon self&#8208;assembly of the hybrid composed of the tetraphenylalanine peptide (4F) conjugated to the PNA dimer adenine&#8208;thymine (at). In this case nucleobases seem to play a key role in determining the morphology and chirality of the fibers. When the PNA &#8220;at&#8221; is replaced by guanine&#8208;cytosine dimer &#8220;gc&#8221;, disordered structures are observed. Spectroscopic characterization of the self&#8208;assembled hybrids, along with AFM and SEM studies is reported. Finally, a structural model consistent with the experimental evidence has also been obtained, showing how the building blocks of 4Fat arrange to give helical fibers.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Talks Between Sulfane Sulfur and Thiol at a Zinc(II) Site</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tripodal [ZnII] complex has been demonstrated to assist cross&#8208;talks between sulfane sulfur and thiol under ambient base&#8208;free conditions, thereby revealing new possible roles of [ZnII] coordination motifs in thiol persulfidation, polysulfide formation, and its cross&#8208;over with free thiol relevant to sulfur biochemistry.







Abstract
Transformations of sulfane sulfur compounds (e.&#8201;g. organic polysulfides (R&#8722;Sn&#8722;R, n&gt;2) and elemental sulfur (S8)) play pivotal roles in the biochemical landscape of sulfur, and thus supports signaling activities of H2S. Although a number of previous reports illustrate amine mediated reactions of S8 and thiol (RSH) yielding R&#8722;Sn&#8722;R, this report illustrates that a tripodal [ZnII] complex [(Bn3Tren)ZnII&#8722;OH2](ClO4)2 (1) facilitates the reactions of sulfane sulfur and thiol (RSH), thereby offering an amine&#8208;free biologically relevant complementary route. UV&#8208;vis monitoring of the reactions and a set of control experiments underline the definitive role of [ZnII] coordination motif in the reactions of sulfane sulfur (e.&#8201;g. S8 and R&#8722;Sn&#8722;R) with RSH. Detailed investigations (UV&#8208;vis, NMR, ESI&#8208;MS, intermediate trapping, and TEMPO radical interference experiments) disclose the key differences in the [ZnII] versus previously known amine mediated routes. Moreover, the persulfide (RSS&#8722;) trapping experiments using 1&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzene (F&#8208;DNB) reveal the intermediacy of RSS&#8722; species in the [ZnII] mediated reactions of sulfane sulfur and thiol, thereby demonstrating [ZnII] assisted persulfidation of thiol in the presence of sulfane sulfur species. Of broader impact, this study underscores the feasible influence of biologically relevant [ZnII] coordination motifs (e.&#8201;g. carbonic anhydrase) on the sulfane sulfur chemistry in biology.

         <title>A Porous Sulfonated 2D Zirconium Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as a Robust Platform for Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D Zr&#8208;MOF gets sulfonated: By using the strategy of pre&#8208;assembly chlorosulfonation applied to a linker precursor, the first sulfonated zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structure is synthesized. The highly stable porous platform is proton conductive under humidified and anhydrous conditions. The 2D nature of the material offers possibilities for modification of its composition, morphology and function towards a variety of energy and environmental applications.







Abstract
By using the strategy of pre&#8208;assembly chlorosulfonation applied to a linker precursor, the first sulfonated zirconium metal&#8211;organic framework (JUK&#8208;14) with two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structure, was synthesized. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that the material is built of Zr6O4(OH)4(COO)8 oxoclusters, doubly 4&#8208;connected by angular dicarboxylates, and stacked in layers spaced 1.5&#8197;nm apart by the presence of sulfonic groups. JUK&#8208;14 exhibits excellent hydrothermal stability, permanent porosity confirmed by gas adsorption studies, and shows high (&gt;10&#8722;4&#8197;S/cm) and low (&lt;10&#8722;8&#8197;S/cm) proton conductivity under humidified and anhydrous conditions, respectively. Post&#8208;synthesis inclusion of imidazole improves the overall conductivity increasing it to 1.7&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S/cm at 60&#8201;&#176;C and 90&#8201;% relative humidity, and by 3 orders of magnitude at 160&#8201;&#176;C. The combination of 2D porous nature with robustness of zirconium MOFs offers new opportunities for exploration of the material towards energy and environmental applications.

&lt;p&gt;By using the strategy of pre-assembly chlorosulfonation applied to a linker precursor, the first sulfonated zirconium metal&#8211;organic framework (&lt;b&gt;JUK-14&lt;/b&gt;) with two-dimensional (2D) structure, was synthesized. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that the material is built of Zr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(COO)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; oxoclusters, doubly 4-connected by angular dicarboxylates, and stacked in layers spaced 1.5&#8197;nm apart by the presence of sulfonic groups. &lt;b&gt;JUK-14&lt;/b&gt; exhibits excellent hydrothermal stability, permanent porosity confirmed by gas adsorption studies, and shows high (&amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S/cm) and low (&amp;lt;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;8&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S/cm) proton conductivity under humidified and anhydrous conditions, respectively. Post-synthesis inclusion of imidazole improves the overall conductivity increasing it to 1.7&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S/cm at 60&#8201;&#176;C and 90&#8201;% relative humidity, and by 3 orders of magnitude at 160&#8201;&#176;C. The combination of 2D porous nature with robustness of zirconium MOFs offers new opportunities for exploration of the material towards energy and environmental applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Labeling of Peptides with o&#8208;Carboranes via Manganese(I)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

The direct incorporation of a carborane moiety into tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides is presented as a sustainable method to access novel potential anti&#8208;cancer and BNCT agents via non&#8208;toxic manganese(I) catalysis.







Abstract
A robust method for the selective labeling of peptides via manganese(I) catalysis was devised to achieve the C&#8208;2 alkenylation of tryptophan containing peptides with 1&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;o&#8208;carboranes. The manganese&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation was accomplished with high catalytic efficiency, and featured low toxicity, high functional group tolerance and excellent E&#8208;stereoselectivity. This approach unravels a promising tool for the assembly of o&#8208;carborane with structurally complex peptides of relevance to applications in boron neutron capture therapy.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate herein the capacity of simple carboxylate salts &#8211; tetrametylammonium and tetramethylguanidinium pivalate &#8211; to act as catalysts in the isomerization of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated thioesters to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioesters. The carboxylate catalysts gave reaction rates comparable to those obtained with DBU, but with fewer side reactions. The reaction exhibits a normal secondary kinetic isotope effect (  k  1H  /  k  1D  = 1.065&#177;0.026) with a &#946;,&#947;&#8722;deuterated substrate. Computational analysis of the mechanism provides a similar value (  k  1H  /  k  1D  = 1.05) with a mechanism where &#947;&#8208;reprotonation of the enolate intermediate is rate determining.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A transfection vector with tumor homing capacity is reported. While previous vectors that allow for moderately cell selective gene transfection utilized larger systems, this small molecule approach allowed for precise chemical optimization. For this biotin, mediating cell selectivity, was combined with the potent DNA&#8208;binding motif tetralysine&#8208;GCP via a hydrophilic linker, thus allowing for SAR based optimization. The new vector was able to mediate biotin receptor (BR)&#8208;selective transfection and was tested on five cell types with different BR expression levels. A computer&#8208;based analysis of microscopy images revealed a preference of one order of magnitude for the BR&#8208;positive cell lines over the BR&#8208;negative controls.</dc:description>

Shining in deep blue: Four highly luminescent emitters can be obtained by a bromine&#8208;lithium exchange borylation&#8208;Suzuki (BLEBS) sequence in a one&#8208;pot fashion. Photophysical properties, such as deep&#8208;blue emission with high quantum yields in different surroundings, make this class of functional chromophores attractive for applications.







Abstract
Four novel intensively blue luminescent chromophores were readily synthesized by bromine&#8208;lithium exchange borylation&#8208;Suzuki (BLEBS) sequence in moderate to good yields. Their electronic properties were studied by absorption and emission spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations revealing deep&#8208;blue emission in solution as well as in the solid state and upon embedding into a PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate) matrix with small FWHM (full width at half maximum) values and CIE y values smaller than 0.1. Moreover, high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY), partially close to unity, are found.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure Reaction Profiles and Activation Volumes of 1,3&#8208;Cyclohexadiene Dimerizations Computed by the Extreme Pressure&#8208;Polarizable Continuum Model (XP&#8208;PCM)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 29, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
XP&#8208;PCM calculations on the thermal dimerizations of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene show that, going from the stepwise to the concerted [4+2] cycloaddition and finally to the concerted [6+4]&#8208;ene mechanisms, as the facial overlap between the rings increases in the transition state structure, the volume of the transition state decreases, leading to a more negative activation volume and increasing reaction acceleration under pressure.







Abstract
Quantum chemical calculations are reported for the thermal dimerizations of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene at 1&#8197;atm and high pressures up to the GPa range. Computed activation enthalpies of plausible dimerization pathways at 1&#8197;atm agree well with the experiment activation energies and the values from previous calculations. High&#8208;pressure reaction profiles, computed by the recently developed extreme pressure&#8208;polarizable continuum model (XP&#8208;PCM), show that the reduction of reaction barrier is more profound in concerted reactions than in stepwise reactions, which is rationalized on the basis of the volume profiles of different mechanisms. A clear shift of the transition state towards the reactant under pressure is revealed for the [6+4]&#8208;ene reaction by the calculations. The computed activation volumes by XP&#8208;PCM agree excellently with the experimental values, confirming the existence of competing mechanisms in the thermal dimerization of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;XP-PCM calculations&lt;/b&gt; on the thermal dimerizations of 1,3-cyclohexadiene show that, going from the stepwise to the concerted [4+2] cycloaddition and finally to the concerted [6+4]-ene mechanisms, as the facial overlap between the rings increases in the transition state structure, the volume of the transition state decreases, leading to a more negative activation volume and increasing reaction acceleration under pressure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantum chemical calculations are reported for the thermal dimerizations of 1,3-cyclohexadiene at 1&#8197;atm and high pressures up to the GPa range. Computed activation enthalpies of plausible dimerization pathways at 1&#8197;atm agree well with the experiment activation energies and the values from previous calculations. High-pressure reaction profiles, computed by the recently developed extreme pressure-polarizable continuum model (XP-PCM), show that the reduction of reaction barrier is more profound in concerted reactions than in stepwise reactions, which is rationalized on the basis of the volume profiles of different mechanisms. A clear shift of the transition state towards the reactant under pressure is revealed for the [6+4]-ene reaction by the calculations. The computed activation volumes by XP-PCM agree excellently with the experimental values, confirming the existence of competing mechanisms in the thermal dimerization of 1,3-cyclohexadiene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design of Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Phenothiazine Derivatives with Triplet&#8208;Related Dual Emission and High&#8208;Contrast Mechanochromism Guided by Polymorph Prediction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 29, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential conformations of phenothiazine derivatives were well predicted by Polymorph Prediction. The crystals of those derivatives with the potential to form both quasi&#8208;axial (ax) and quasi&#8208;equatorial (eq) conformations could undergo conformation transition and showed high&#8208;contrast mechanochromism (MC). All the derivatives exhibited aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and triplet&#8208;related dual emission (DEM) characters.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;contrast stimulus&#8208;responsive materials with excited triplet emission is of great significance for anti&#8208;counterfeiting, sensor and memory applications, but remains a challenge. Here, we report a strategy for the rational design of stimulus&#8208;responsive phenothiazine derivatives with triplet&#8208;related dual emissions and high&#8208;contrast mechanochromism guided by Polymorph Prediction. The designed phenothiazine derivatives have the characters of simple structures, a facile synthetic procedure, and a good crystalline nature. We found that the crystals of those derivatives with the potential to form both quasi&#8208;axial (ax) and quasi&#8208;equatorial (eq) conformations could undergo conformation transition and show significant emission difference (&#916;&#955;em&gt;100&#8197;nm) under mechanical force. Meanwhile, all these phenothiazine derivatives exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission and emit room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence or thermally activated delayed fluorescence. The significant luminescent change of these materials under different stimuli gives them promise for applications in encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Photochemical Olefin Isomerization of Unsaturated Ketones via 1,5&#8208;Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 29, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bring on the Light: An efficient photochemical metal/catalyst&#8208;free system has been uncovered for the selective one&#8208;bond olefin migration of unsaturated ketones. Diverse substrate scope, functional group tolerance and its application for dehomologation and one&#8208;carbon selective olefin migration processes in linear alkenes highlights the usefulness of this method.







Abstract
The photochemical isomerization of &#945;,&#946;&#8208; to &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones through a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer mechanism under mild conditions with high efficiency and selectivity is reported. The reaction is carried out in the absence of metal catalysts or other additives, and its stereoselectivity can be tuned by selecting appropriate solvent mixtures. The reaction&#8216;s scope and tolerance towards functional groups, including light&#8208;sensitive halogens, free acids and alcohols, were studied, providing reliable access to a wide variety of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. This methodology details the deconjugation of a wide range of unsaturated ketones and, when combined with olefin metathesis, provides an efficient process for either dehomologation or one&#8208;carbon double&#8208;bond migration of terminal alkenes.

         <title>Homogeneous&#8208;to&#8208;Heterogeneous&#8208;Strategy Enables Multifunctional Phase&#8208;Change Materials for Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 29, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homogenous&#8208;to&#8208;heterogenous&#8208;strategy was raised as a concept to enable the fabrication of multifunctional phase change materials (PCMs). The as&#8208;prepared PCM was endowed with enhanced thermal performance, shape flexibility, and organic pollutant removing function. This novel strategy is expected to be one of universal PCMs encapsulation method.







Abstract
Functional phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) are conspicuously absent in various organic or inorganic solids with diversified applications in which the attributes of these molecular materials have been highly realized. Leakage problem during the phase transition process is the main obstacle on the way of widely use of solid&#8208;liquid PCMs who has been recognized to be promisingly practical candidates for energy storage owing to the high energy storage density and small volume change in the phase transition process. Herein, a novel homogeneous&#8208;to&#8208;heterogeneous&#8208;strategy, in which all the starting materials involved display a homogeneous state and the encapsulation framework formed in&#8197;situ in the encapsulation process, enabled by an aerogel reaction of silica was realized under the catalysis of an organic base. Besides the comprehensive study upon energy storage performance, light&#8208;to&#8208;thermal conversion and recyclability performance study of the obtained materials reveal the clear superiority over pristine paraffin wax (PW) thanks to the versatility and robustness of this fabrication method. More importantly, the homogeneous&#8208;to&#8208;heterogeneous&#8208;strategy endows a unique adsorption ability with respect to organic pollutant due to the PCMs inside and therefore bearing a great potential to be used in environment protection fields.

         <dc:description>
The first counterpart of starphene, namely starazine, that contains a nonaaza&#8208;core structure and three peripheral isoquinoline units locked by three tetracoordinate borons to form a quasi&#8208;planar backbone is described. This starazine possesses a non&#8208;aromatic and electron&#8208;deficient core due to the introduction of the heteroatoms replacing the corresponding carbon atoms in starphene. The transition to its lowest excited state is allowed, sharply contrasting to the starphenes, endowing fluorescent properties to this novel starlike dye molecule.







Abstract
A starlike heterocyclic molecule containing an electron&#8208;deficient nonaaza&#8208;core structure and three peripheral isoquinolines locked by three tetracoordinate borons, namely isoquinoline&#8208;nona&#8208;starazine (QNSA), is synthesized by using readily available reactants through a rather straightforward approach. This new heteroatom&#8208;rich QNSA possesses a quasi&#8208;planar &#960;&#8208;backbone structure, and bears phenyl substituents on borons which protrude on both sides of the &#960;&#8208;backbones endowing it with good solubility in common organic solvents. Contrasting to its starphene analogue, QNSA shows intense fluorescence with a quantum yield (PLQY) of up to 62&#8201;% in dilute solution.

Understanding the kinetics of a reaction is important if one wish to control it. It was realized that diisobutylaluminium hydride (DIBAL) promoted debenzylation of the secondary alcohols in 2A&#8211;F,3A&#8211;F,6B,C,E,F&#8208;hexadecabenzyl &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (4) was zero order in DIBAL and most likely following an intramolecular mechanism. Using this information, 2A&#8211;F,3B,C,E,F,6B,C,E,F&#8208;tetradecabenzyl &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (Lings tetrol), an extremely useful building block, could be formed as sole product and in good yield by conducting the reaction at low DIBAL concentration.







Abstract
The kinetics of the reaction of perbenzyl &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin was studied varying the concentration of DIBAL and substrate, and the temperature. The initial debenzylation was found to be 1st order in substrate and follow the relationship 0.0675+0.179[DIBAL]2 with respect to the concentration of DIBAL. The second and the third debenzylation which led to the 3A,6A,6D&#8208;triol (Lings triol) were both found to be 1st order in substrate concentration and zero order in DIBAL concentration. Longer reaction times with DIBAL in high concentration gave further debenzylation to comparatively complex mixtures containing the 2B,3A,6A,6D&#8208;tetrol and the 3A,6A,6C,6D&#8208;tetrol. In contrast reaction at 0.1&#8197;M DIBAL gave the symmetrical 3A,6A,3D,6D&#8208;tetrol (Lings tetrol) in 60&#8201;% yield. The effect of chlorine or methyl substitution of the phenyl groups of perbenzyl &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin was also investigated. Per 4&#8208;chlorobenzyl slowed down the reaction with DIBAL, while 4&#8208;methylbenzyl increased the reaction rate, but still gave the corresponding 6&#8197;A&#8208;monool or 6A,6D&#8208;diol products. A Hammett reaction constant of &#8722;4.9 was found for the first debenzylation showing a high degree of positive charge in the transition state. The per(2,4&#8208;dichlorobenzyl)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;derivative was completely resistant to DIBAL, however upon addition of trimethyl aluminium this derivative also reacted to give the 6A,6D&#8208;diol product.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Csp2&#8722;OMe Functionalization for Chemoselective Aromatic Homologation En Route to Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 29, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni(0)&#8208;catalyzed methodology efficiently achieves Csp2&#8722;OMe functionalization in the presence of internal alkynes, forming chemoselectively either aromatic homologation or intramolecular monoannulation products. Furthermore, aromatic homologation products are proven as valid precursors for further diversification towards nanographene&#8208;like synthesis.







Abstract
A Ni&#8208;catalyzed Csp2&#8722;OMe ortho&#8208;functionalization methodology to form chemoselectively alkyne monoannulation or aromatic homologation products is reported as a novel protocol towards the valorisation of substrates containing Csp2&#8722;OMe units. Double activation of Csp2&#8722;OMe and Csp2&#8722;F bonds is also demonstrated. Further use of aromatic homologation products towards the synthesis of nanographene&#8208;like compounds is described.

A &#956;&#8208;amido complex was obtained by the reaction of a dicationic triruthenium complex containing a &#956;3&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;C3 ring with NH3. Subsequent treatment with base caused C&#8722;N bond formation, yielding a &#956;3&#8208;azaruthenacyclopentadienyl complex. The azaruthenacyclopentadiene skeleton was alternatively synthesized by the photolysis of a mono&#8208;cationic analogue in an NH3 atmosphere, in which the C3 ring skeleton was broken via the electron transfer to the &#960;*(C&#8722;C) orbital in the C3 ring







Abstract
A dicationic triruthenium complex containing a &#956;3&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;C3 ring, [(Cp*Ru)3(&#956;3&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;C3MeH2&#8722;)(&#956;3&#8208;CH)(&#956;&#8208;H)]2+ (1&#8201;a, Cp*=&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5), reacted with ammonia to yield a &#956;&#8208;amido complex, [(Cp*Ru)3(&#956;3&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;CHCMeCH) (&#956;3&#8208;CH)(&#956;&#8208;NH2)]2+ (5), via N&#8722;H bond scission. Subsequent treatment with base resulted in C&#8722;N bond formation to yield a &#956;3&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;1&#8208;azabutadien&#8208;4&#8208;yl complex, [(Cp*Ru)3(&#956;3&#8208;CH)(&#956;3&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;NH=CH&#8722;CMe=CH&#8722;)]+ (6&#8201;a). The azaruthenacyclopentadiene skeleton was alternatively synthesized by the photolysis of mono&#8208;cationic complex [(Cp*Ru)3(&#956;3&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;C3RH2&#8722;)(&#956;3&#8208;CH)]+ (2&#8201;a; R=Me, 2&#8201;b; R=H) in the presence of ammonia. The C3 ring skeleton was broken via the electron transfer to the &#960;*(C&#8722;C) orbital in the C3 ring, and a transiently generated unsaturated &#956;3&#8208;allylic species can take up ammonia, resulting in N&#8722;H bond scission followed by C&#8722;N bond formation.

         <title>Superassembled Hierarchical Asymmetric Magnetic Mesoporous Nanorobots Driven by Smart Confined Catalytic Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 29, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Set in motion: A hierarchical, asymmetric, magnetic, mesoporous, hollow nanorobot was constructed according to a sequential, interfacial superassembly strategy. This nanorobot integrated magnetic responsiveness, confined catalytic degradation, durable motion, recyclability into a single system; this not only sets a platform for manipulating its motion, but also provides a promising tool for various future applications.







Abstract
Micro/nanoscale robotics has received great attention in many important fields. However, it is still a great challenge to construct nanorobots simultaneously possessing multifunctionality, well&#8208;controlled directionality, and fast and durable motion as well as fully compatible and biodegradable components. Here, a hierarchical, asymmetric, hollow, catalytic, magnetic, and mesoporous nanorobot has been fabricated through a multistep interfacial superassembly strategy. The multilayer composites consist of hollow silica nanoflasks sequentially coated with a highly magnetic responsive Fe3O4 layer, a mesoporous silica layer with homogeneous vertical channels, and a layer of catalytic gold nanoparticles on both the inner and outer surfaces. Furthermore, para&#8208;nitrophenol was used as a model pollutant to trigger self&#8208;motility of the nanoflasks by confined catalytic degradation (CCD). We found that the bottleneck morphology and mesoporous surface both improved the catalytic nanoparticle loading capability and CCD effect, thus enabling efficient self&#8208;motility and a durable movement capacity of &#8764;100&#8197;h. In addition, the catalytic performance was improved by 180&#8201;% compared with that of solid spherical nanoparticles.

     alt="Superassembled Hierarchical Asymmetric Magnetic Mesoporous Nanorobots Driven by Smart Confined Catalytic Degradation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Set in motion&lt;/b&gt;: A hierarchical, asymmetric, magnetic, mesoporous, hollow nanorobot was constructed according to a sequential, interfacial superassembly strategy. This nanorobot integrated magnetic responsiveness, confined catalytic degradation, durable motion, recyclability into a single system; this not only sets a platform for manipulating its motion, but also provides a promising tool for various future applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Micro/nanoscale robotics has received great attention in many important fields. However, it is still a great challenge to construct nanorobots simultaneously possessing multifunctionality, well-controlled directionality, and fast and durable motion as well as fully compatible and biodegradable components. Here, a hierarchical, asymmetric, hollow, catalytic, magnetic, and mesoporous nanorobot has been fabricated through a multistep interfacial superassembly strategy. The multilayer composites consist of hollow silica nanoflasks sequentially coated with a highly magnetic responsive Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; layer, a mesoporous silica layer with homogeneous vertical channels, and a layer of catalytic gold nanoparticles on both the inner and outer surfaces. Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-nitrophenol was used as a model pollutant to trigger self-motility of the nanoflasks by confined catalytic degradation (CCD). We found that the bottleneck morphology and mesoporous surface both improved the catalytic nanoparticle loading capability and CCD effect, thus enabling efficient self-motility and a durable movement capacity of &#8764;100&#8197;h. In addition, the catalytic performance was improved by 180&#8201;% compared with that of solid spherical nanoparticles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deep&#8208;Red Emissive Squaraine&#8208;AIEgen in Elastomer Enabling High Contrast and Fast Thermoresponse for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting and Temperature Sensing**
</title>

         <dc:description>
A new red&#8208;emissive squaraine&#8208;based AIEgen is designed for high performance thermoresponsive materials. Molecularly dispersing the AIEgen into an elastomer&#8208;like poly(styrene&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene) (SBR) is shown to significantly improve both the contrast ratio and response time of the resulting thermoresponsive film, making it quite suitable for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and temperature sensing.







Abstract
Two challenges remain for organic thermoresponsive materials; one is to develop high&#8208;performance red&#8208;emissive thermoresponsive materials, while another is to simultaneously achieve high contrast ratio (CR), fast and reversible thermoresponse in a single element. Herein, we not only develop a new deep&#8208;red emissive squaraine&#8208;based AIEgen (TPE&#8208;SQ12) based on a pyrylium end group, which is suitable for fabricating high&#8208;performance thermoresponsive materials, but also show an effective approach to improve both CR (&#8764;ten times increase) and response time (less than 3 seconds), that is, molecularly dispersing AIEgen into an elastomer, attributed to the significantly expanded free volume of elastomer upon increasing the temperature that can activate the AIEgen intramolecular movements more pronouncedly. Double encryption and temperature mapping systems have been separately established by using our designed elastomer/TPE&#8208;SQ12 film, showing the great potential for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and temperature sensing. Finally, white emission is further achieved by co&#8208;doping TPE&#8208;SQ12 with cyan dye into elastomer, which enables fluorescent thermochromism for improving the temperature mapping ability.

         <title>Anomeric Stereoauxiliary Cleavage of the C&#8722;N Bond of d&#8208;Glucosamine for the Preparation of Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 29, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An &#945;&#8208;anomeric stereoauxiliary strategy for the targeted cleavage of C&#8722;N bonds in d&#8208;glucosamine was achieved through a seven&#8208;membered ring transition&#8208;state intermediate and the simultaneous incorporation of amine moieties in imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines. This method provides a novel strategy for the C&#8722;N bond cleavage and unlocks efficient access to diverse imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines blocks bearing versatile functional groups.







Abstract
The targeted cleavage of the C&#8722;N bonds of alkyl primary amines in sustainable compounds of biomass according to a metal&#8208;free pathway and the conjunction of nitrogen in the synthesis of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines are still highly challenging. Despite tremendous progress in the synthesis of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines over the past decade, many of them can still not be efficiently prepared. Herein, we report an anomeric stereoauxiliary approach for the synthesis of a wide range of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines after cleaving the C&#8722;N bond of d&#8208;glucosamine (&#945;&#8208;2&#176; amine) from biobased resources. This new approach expands the scope of readily accessible imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines relative to existing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods. A key strategic advantage of this approach is that the &#945;&#8208;anomer of d&#8208;glucosamine enables C&#8722;N bond cleavage via a seven&#8208;membered ring transition state. By using this novel method, a series of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives (&gt;80 examples) was synthesized from pyridine ketones (including para&#8208;dipyridine ketone) and aldehydes (including para&#8208;dialdehyde). Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives containing diverse important deuterated C(sp2)&#8722;H and C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds were also efficiently achieved.

         <title>The Influence of UiO&#8208;66 Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Structural Defects on Adsorption and Separation of Hexane Isomers</title>

         <dc:description>
The presence of structural defects in the crystal lattice of the microporous UiO&#8208;66 metal&#8211;organic framework affects the adsorption and separation of constitutional isomers of hexane. Experimental adsorption isobars were recreated using Monte Carlo molecular modelling in order to fully understand the observed phenomena at the molecular level.







Abstract
In this work, adsorption properties of the UiO&#8208;66 metal&#8211;organic framework were investigated, with particular emphasis on the influence of structural defects. A series of UiO&#8208;66 samples were synthesized and characterized using a wide range of experimental techniques. Type I adsorption isotherms for low&#8208;temperature adsorption of N2 and Ar showed that micropore volume and specific surface area significantly increase with the number of defects. Adsorption of hexane isomers in UiO&#8208;66 was studied by means of quasi&#8208;equilibrated temperature&#8208;programmed desorption and adsorption (QE&#8208;TPDA) experimental and Monte Carlo simulation techniques. QE&#8208;TPDA profiles revealed that only defect&#8208;free UiO&#8208;66 exhibits distinct two adsorption states. This technique also yielded high&#8208;quality adsorption isobars that were successfully recreated using Grand&#8208;Canonical Monte Carlo molecular simulations, which, however, required refinement of the existing force fields. The calculations demonstrated the detailed mechanism of adsorption and separation of hexane isomers in the UiO&#8208;66 structure. The preferred tetrahedral cages provide suitable voids for bulky molecules, which is the reason for unusual &#8220;reverse&#8221; selectivity of UiO&#8208;66 towards di&#8208;branched alkanes. Interconnection of the tetrahedral cavities due to missing organic linkers greatly reduces the selectivity of the defected material.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Thermal Synthesis of Extra&#8208;Large&#8208;Pore Aluminophosphate Zeotype via Self&#8208;Assembly of Double&#8208;Four&#8208;Ring Unit</title>

A simple solvent&#8208;free thermal synthesis method was developed to prepare extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore aluminophosphate zeotype DNL&#8208;1, unravelling its crystallization process via self&#8208;assembly of d4r unit, an intermediate formed at synthesis conditions of low water content in presence of a template structure with alkyl chains of proper length. This new synthesis strategy is suitable for rational preparation of d4r&#8208;containing extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolitic materials in the absence of Ge.







Abstract
The use of Ge as framework atom to direct the formation of double&#8208;four&#8208;ring (d4r) unit is an effective way to prepare zeolite with extra&#8208;large pores, which however also brings about serious problems with regard to production cost and structure stability for their practical application. A new solvent&#8208;free thermal synthesis strategy is presented here for facile preparation and molecular&#8208;level mechanism study of extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore aluminophosphate zeotype DNL&#8208;1 with &#8208;CLO structure. For the first time, the formation of intermediate d4r in the induction period was successfully confirmed, and was correlated with the synthesis condition of low water content and quaternary ammonium template with suitable alkyl chain length. The self&#8208;assembly pathway via d4r to form lta, afterwards clo and super cages was further revealed. This work shed light on the rational synthesis of Ge&#8208;free extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeotypes based on d4r route.

This new synthesis strategy is suitable for rational preparation of &lt;i&gt;d4r-&lt;/i&gt;containing extra-large-pore zeolitic materials in the absence of Ge.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of Ge as framework atom to direct the formation of double-four-ring (&lt;i&gt;d4r&lt;/i&gt;) unit is an effective way to prepare zeolite with extra-large pores, which however also brings about serious problems with regard to production cost and structure stability for their practical application. A new solvent-free thermal synthesis strategy is presented here for facile preparation and molecular-level mechanism study of extra-large-pore aluminophosphate zeotype DNL-1 with -CLO structure. For the first time, the formation of intermediate &lt;i&gt;d4r&lt;/i&gt; in the induction period was successfully confirmed, and was correlated with the synthesis condition of low water content and quaternary ammonium template with suitable alkyl chain length. The self-assembly pathway via &lt;i&gt;d4r&lt;/i&gt; to form &lt;i&gt;lta&lt;/i&gt;, afterwards &lt;i&gt;clo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;super&lt;/i&gt; cages was further revealed. This work shed light on the rational synthesis of Ge-free extra-large-pore zeotypes based on &lt;i&gt;d4r&lt;/i&gt; route.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photochemical Deracemization of a Medicinally&#8208;Relevant Benzopyran using an Oscillatory Flow Reactor</title>

Photo&#8208;transformation: Unlike classical enantiomeric resolution methods, crystallization&#8208;induced diastereomer transformations (CIDTs) allow full conversion to the desired enantiomer. Using photochemical racemization for a CIDT has not before been published in the scientific literature. We report the use of an oscillatory flow reactor for efficient irradiation, allowing high yield and &gt;95&#8201;% ee to be achieved in a reaction time of just a few hours.







Abstract
Dynamic deracemization processes, such as crystallization&#8208;induced diastereomer transformations (CIDTs), offer the opportunity to combine racemization and resolution processes, to provide high yields of enantiomerically pure compounds. To date, few of these processes have incorporated photochemical racemization. By combining batch crystallization with a flow photoreactor for efficient irradiation, it is possible to perform such deracemization in an effective, scalable and high yielding manner. After applying design of experiment (DoE) principles and mathematical modelling, the most efficient parameter set could be identified, leading to excellent results in just 4&#8197;h reaction time: isolated yield of 82&#8201;% and assay ee of 96&#8201;%. Such photochemical racemization methods can serve to open new avenues for preparation of enantiomerically pure functional molecules on both small and industrially&#8208;relevant scales.

The potential conformations of phenthiazine derivatives have been predicted by Polymorph Prediction. The crystals of those derivatives with the potential to form both quasi&#8208;axial and quasi&#8208;equatorial conformations can undergo conformation transition and show high&#8208;contrast mechanochromism from local emission (LE) to intramolecular or intermolecular charge transfer (CT) emission. All the derivatives also exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission and triplet&#8208;related dual emission characters. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Xiao, T. Yi, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200458).

Hydrodefluorination (HDF) is a very important fundamental transformation for conversion of the C&#8722;F bond into the C&#8722;H bond in organic synthesis. In this Review, we mainly focus on the HDF of fluorinated organic compounds (FOCs) by photo&#8208; and electrochemical strategies, along with mechanistic insights.







Abstract
Hydrodefluorination (HDF) is a very important fundamental transformation for conversion of the C&#8722;F bond into the C&#8722;H bond in organic synthesis. In the past decade, much progress has been achieved with HDF through the utility of low&#8208;valent metals, transition&#8208;metal complexes and main&#8208;group Lewis acids. Recently, novel methods have been introduced for this purpose through photo&#8208; and electrochemical pathways, which are of great significance, due to their considerable environmental and economical advantages. This Review highlights the HDF of fluorinated organic compounds (FOCs) through photo&#8208; and electrochemical strategies, along with mechanistic insights.

Polymers for solar cells: This review summarizes high&#8208;performance polymer acceptors based on the recently developed electron&#8208;deficient building blocks, including bithiophene imide (BTI) derivatives, B&#8592;N&#8208;incorporated (hetero)arenes, cyano&#8208;functionalized (hetero)arenes, and fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors. Additionally, the single&#8208;component&#8208;based polymers are also briefly discussed. Finally, we also offer our insights into the materials design for realizing all&#8208;PSCs with further improved device performance and stability.







Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) have attracted considerable attention owing to their pronounced advantages of excellent mechanical flexibility/stretchability and greatly enhanced device stability as compared to other types of organic solar cells (OSCs). Thanks to the extensive research efforts dedicated to the development of polymer acceptors, all&#8208;PSCs have achieved remarkable improvement of photovoltaic performance, recently. This review summarizes the recent progress of polymer acceptors based on the key electron&#8208;deficient building blocks, which include bithiophene imide (BTI) derivatives, boron&#8208;nitrogen coordination bond (B&#8592;N)&#8208;incorporated (hetero)arenes, cyano&#8208;functionalized (hetero)arenes, and fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (FREAs). In addition, single&#8208;component&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs are also briefly discussed. The structure&#8208;property correlations of polymer acceptors are elaborated in detail. Finally, we offer our insights into the development of new electron&#8208;deficient building blocks with further optimized properties and the polymers built from them for efficient all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Sensing of Acidic Catecholamine Metabolites Using a Programmable Nanopore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acidic catecholamine metabolites, which could serve as diagnostic markers for many diseases, demonstrate an importance of accurate sensing. However, they share a highly similar chemical structure, which is a challenge in the design of sensing strategies. A nanopore may be engineered to sense these metabolites in a single molecule manner. To achieve this, a recently developed programmable nano&#8208;reactor for stochastic sensing (PNRSS) technique adapted with a phenylboronic acid (PBA) adaptor was applied. Three acidic catecholamine metabolites, including 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), 3,4&#8208;dihydroxymandelic acid (DHMA) and 3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxymandetic acid (VMA) were investigated by PNRSS. Specifically, DHMA, which contains an &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylate moiety and an adjacent  cis  &#8208;hydroxyl groups on its benzene ring, reports two binding modes simultaneously resolvable by PNRSS. Assisted with the high resolution of PNRSS, direct regulation of these two binding modes by pH can also be observed. A custom machine learning algorithm was also developed to achieve automatic event classification.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Acidic catecholamine metabolites, which could serve as diagnostic markers for many diseases, demonstrate an importance of accurate sensing. However, they share a highly similar chemical structure, which is a challenge in the design of sensing strategies. A nanopore may be engineered to sense these metabolites in a single molecule manner. To achieve this, a recently developed programmable nano-reactor for stochastic sensing (PNRSS) technique adapted with a phenylboronic acid (PBA) adaptor was applied. Three acidic catecholamine metabolites, including 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid (DHMA) and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxymandetic acid (VMA) were investigated by PNRSS. Specifically, DHMA, which contains an &#945;-hydroxycarboxylate moiety and an adjacent  cis  -hydroxyl groups on its benzene ring, reports two binding modes simultaneously resolvable by PNRSS. Assisted with the high resolution of PNRSS, direct regulation of these two binding modes by pH can also be observed. A custom machine learning algorithm was also developed to achieve automatic event classification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>GNPS&#8208;Guided Discovery of Madurastatin Siderophores from the Termite&#8208;Associated Actinomadura sp. RB99**

Metabolomic analysis of cocultures of Actinomadura sp. RB99 with fungal symbionts of termites allowed for the MS&#8208;guided isolation of four unreported madurastatin derivatives, including a siderophore&#8208;metal complex thereof.







Abstract
In this study, we analyzed if Actinomadura sp. RB99 produces siderophores that that could be responsible for the antimicrobial activity observed in co&#8208;cultivation studies. Dereplication of high&#8208;resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HRMS/MS) and global natural product social molecular networking platform (GNPS) analysis of fungus&#8208;bacterium co&#8208;cultures resulted in the identification of five madurastatin derivatives (A1, A2, E1, F, and G1), of which were four new derivatives. Chemical structures were unambiguously confirmed by HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS, 1D and 2D NMR experiments, as well as MS/MS data and their absolute structures were elucidated based on Marfey's analysis, DP4+ probability calculation and total synthesis. Structure analysis revealed that madurastatin E1 (2) contained a rare 4&#8208;imidazolidinone cyclic moiety and madurastatin A1 (5) was characterized as a Ga3+&#8208;complex. The function of madurastatins as siderophores was evaluated using the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans as model organism. Based on homology models, we identified the putative NRPS&#8208;based gene cluster region of the siderophores in Actinomadura sp. RB99.

Revealing a radical route: The radical reactivity of the biradical [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8901;] has been investigated. It was possible to synthesize the persistent phosphorus&#8208;centered monoradical [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8722;Et] and identify it as a radical intermediate during the addition of bromoethane to [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8901;]. A possible stepwise mechanism of this reaction was formulated and is supported by both detailed quantum chemical calculations and experimental results.







Abstract
The activation of C&#8722;Br bonds in various bromoalkanes by the biradical [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8901;] (1) (Ter=2,6&#8208;bis&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)&#8208;phenyl) is reported, yielding trans&#8208;addition products of the type [Br&#8722;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8722;R] (2), so&#8208;called 1,3&#8208;substituted cyclo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diphospha&#8208;2,4&#8208;diazanes. This addition reaction, which represents a new easy approach to asymmetrically substituted cyclo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diphospha&#8208;2,4&#8208;diazanes, was investigated mechanistically by different spectroscopic methods (NMR, EPR, IR, Raman); the results suggested a stepwise radical reaction mechanism, as evidenced by the in&#8208;situ detection of the phosphorus&#8208;centered monoradical [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8208;R].&lt; To provide further evidence for the radical mechanism, [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8208;Et] (3Et&#8901;) was synthesized directly by reduction of the bromoethane addition product [Br&#8208;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8208;Et] (2&#8201;a) with magnesium, resulting in the formation of the persistent phosphorus&#8208;centered monoradical [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8208;Et], which could be isolated and fully characterized, including single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Comparison of the EPR spectrum of the radical intermediate in the addition reaction with that of the synthesized new [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8208;Et] radical clearly proves the existence of radicals over the course of the reaction of biradical [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8901;] (1) with bromoethane. Extensive DFT and coupled cluster calculations corroborate the experimental data for a radical mechanism in the reaction of biradical [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8901;] with EtBr. In the field of hetero&#8208;cyclobutane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyls, the demonstration of a stepwise radical reaction represents a new aspect and closes the gap between P&#8208;centered biradicals and P&#8208;centered monoradicals in terms of radical reactivity.

         <title>Identifying the Molecular Origins of Green BN&#8208;TADF Material Degradation and Device Stability via in&#8197;situ Raman Spectroscopy</title>

Terminal substituents and conformational changes have a great impact on OLED device efficiency and stability investigated by in&#8197;situ Raman spectroscopy. Compared to BN&#8208;PhOH with the lowest EQEmax of 19.0&#8201;% and LT50 of 1.7&#8197;h, BN&#8208;PhN(CH3)2 exhibited the longest OLED device lifetime (7.7&#8197;h), enhanced EQEmax of 24.1&#8201;%, and alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off, as a manifestation of less conformational changes.







Abstract
There is little investigation into the impact of molecular conformation on device efficiency and degradation of boron&#8208;nitrogen thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters (BN&#8208;TADF). Herein, three highly&#8208;efficient green BN&#8208;TADF emitters have been designed to unveil the impact of peripheral phenyl groups on device efficiencies and lifetimes. Compared to BN&#8208;PhOH with the lowest EQEmax of 19&#8201;%, BN&#8208;PhOCH3 and BN&#8208;PhN(CH3)2 have achieved strongly enhanced EQEmax of 25.6&#8201;% and 24.1&#8201;%, respectively. Importantly, the device lifetimes (LT50) are dramatically improved from 1.7&#8197;h of BN&#8208;PhOH to 4.4&#8197;h of BN&#8208;PhOCH3 and 7.7&#8197;h of BN&#8208;PhN(CH3)2 without encapsulation. According to in&#8197;situ Raman spectroscopy and simulations, BN&#8208;PhN(CH3)2 of less conformation change after aging exhibits the best photostability. It is proposed that the torsion angle change between the BN core and the peripheral phenyl group results in BN&#8208;TADF degradation. This knowledge means precisely tuning peripheral groups of BN&#8208;TADF can achieve both higher device efficiencies and longer lifetimes.

         <title>Indole Editing Enabled by HFIP&#8208;Mediated Ring&#8208;Switch Reactions of 3&#8208;Amino&#8208;2&#8208;Hydroxyindolines</title>

Indole multi&#8208;site editing!! Unprecedented indole multi&#8208;site editing was accomplished by a unique ring&#8208;switch reaction of hemiaminals.







Abstract
This work reports the novel reactivity of hemiaminal as a precursor for indole editing at the multi&#8208;site. The HFIP&#8208;promoted indole editing of indoline hemiaminals affords 2&#8208;arylindoles through a ring&#8208;switch sequence. The key to success of this transformation is to use a cyclic hemiaminal as an &#945;&#8208;amino aldehyde surrogate under transient tautomeric control. This transformation features mild reaction conditions and good yields with broad functional group tolerance. The utility of this transformation is presented through the one&#8208;pot protocol and the synthesis of isocryptolepine.

         <title>The Unexpected Helical Supramolecular Assembly of a Simple Achiral Acetamide Tecton Generates Selective Water Channels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral channels with highly mobile water molecules result from the robust self&#8208;organization of a simple achiral acetamide. Fully reversible release and re&#8208;uptake of water molecules takes place near ambient conditions, with efficient water transport and a good selectivity against NaCl suggesting it to be an efficient candidate for desalination processes. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. van&#8197;der&#8197;Lee and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200383).

         <dc:description>
A blue&#8208;luminescent PtII complex bearing an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene changes luminescence color in response to the vapor atmosphere while maintaining its single crystallinity and luminescence intensity. The vapor&#8208;induced reversible and stepwise single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformations were elucidated by variable&#8208;temperature and continuous in&#8208;situ tracking of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements.

         <title>Tuning the Properties of 5&#8208;Azido and 5&#8208;Nitramino&#8208;tetrazoles by Diverse Functionalization &#8211; General Concepts for Future Energetic Materials</title>

Derivatization of 5&#8208;azido and 5&#8208;nitraminotetrazole with an azidoethyl, nitratoethyl or methyl group gives access to less acidic high explosives with versatile properties. Salt formation of the nitraminotetrazoles with nitrogen&#8208;rich and metal cations was performed to achieve less acidity, lower vapor pressure and higher thermal stability. The modification of the nitramino and azidotetrazole backbones show and nice way to tune the compounds&#8217; properties and are valuable for the design of future energetic materials.







Abstract
5&#8208;Azido and 5&#8208;nitraminotetrazole backbones are established heterocyclic motifs in the research field of energetic materials synthesis. Despite the high energy content of the compounds, the problem with many derivatives is that their sensitivities are far too high. Functionalization of one of the ring nitrogen atoms is the aim of this study to adjust the sensitivity by inserting nitratoethyl, azidoethyl and methyl groups. In this context, derivatives of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;azidoethyl)&#8208;5&#8208;nitraminotetrazoles (2, 2&#8201;a&#8211;2&#8201;d), as well as 1&#8208;nitrato and 1&#8208;azidoethyl substituted 5&#8208;azidotetrazole (7 and 10) and the methylation products of 5&#8208;azidotetrazole (5&#8208;azido&#8208;1&#8208;methyl&#8208;tetrazole, 11 and 5&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;tetrazole, 12) were prepared. The obtained nitrogen&#8208;rich compounds were extensively characterized through multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and IR spectroscopy. The structural confinement was checked by X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments. The pure samples (verified by elemental analysis) were investigated regarding their behavior toward friction, impact (BAM methods) and electrostatic discharge as well as heating (DTA and DSC). For all metal&#8208;free compounds the detonation properties were computed with the EXPLO5 code using their density and heat of formation, calculated based on CBS&#8208;4&#8197;M level of theory.

         <title>Pulsed Laser Excited Photoacoustic Effect for Disease Diagnosis and Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pulsed laser excited photoacoustic effect is increasingly employed for the diagnosis and treatment of diverse diseases. Pulsed laser irradiation is observed to generate reactive species by photosensitization&#8208;free nanocapsules, which potentially broadens the scope of general photosensitizers via facile light mode switching from continuous to pulsed one. In this Concept article, the research status of pulsed laser excited disease theranostics is summarized to inspire novel methodologies and extra photoacoustic and photodynamic materials.







Abstract
Pulsed laser can excite light absorber to generate photoacoustic (PA) effect, that is, when the absorber is irradiated with pulsed laser, the absorbed light energy is converted into local heat to cause rapid thermoelastic expansion and generate acoustic wave. The generated PA signal has been widely employed for the diagnosis of many diseases with superb contrast, high penetrability and sensitivity. In addition, with the increase of pulsed laser energy, the resulting PA shockwave and cavitation can promote efficient drug release at lesion sites to potentiate the resulting therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, the PA shockwave/cavitation can mechanically inhibit disease and produce reactive species. In this Concept article, the principle and research status of pulsed laser excited disease theranostics are briefly summarized, extra suggestions are proposed to inspire extensive PA probes and photodynamic materials as well as novel methodologies.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pulsed laser excited&lt;/b&gt; photoacoustic effect is increasingly employed for the diagnosis and treatment of diverse diseases. Pulsed laser irradiation is observed to generate reactive species by photosensitization-free nanocapsules, which potentially broadens the scope of general photosensitizers via facile light mode switching from continuous to pulsed one. In this Concept article, the research status of pulsed laser excited disease theranostics is summarized to inspire novel methodologies and extra photoacoustic and photodynamic materials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulsed laser can excite light absorber to generate photoacoustic (PA) effect, that is, when the absorber is irradiated with pulsed laser, the absorbed light energy is converted into local heat to cause rapid thermoelastic expansion and generate acoustic wave. The generated PA signal has been widely employed for the diagnosis of many diseases with superb contrast, high penetrability and sensitivity. In addition, with the increase of pulsed laser energy, the resulting PA shockwave and cavitation can promote efficient drug release at lesion sites to potentiate the resulting therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, the PA shockwave/cavitation can mechanically inhibit disease and produce reactive species. In this Concept article, the principle and research status of pulsed laser excited disease theranostics are briefly summarized, extra suggestions are proposed to inspire extensive PA probes and photodynamic materials as well as novel methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Promoted RhI&#8208;Catalyzed C2&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Alkenylation and Polyenylation of Imidazoles with Alkenyl Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A RhI&#8208;catalyzed C2&#8722;H alkenylation of imidazoles with alkenyl carboxylic acids with highly regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity is reported. This protocol merges C&#8722;H bond functionalization and the decarbonylation of carboxylic acids, accommodates a wide range of substrates with good compatibility of functional groups, and can be easily scaled.







Abstract
The first RhI&#8208;catalyzed, directed decarbonylative C2&#8722;H alkenylation of imidazoles with readily available alkenyl carboxylic acids is reported. The reaction proceeds in a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective manner, providing efficient access to C2&#8208;alkenylated imidazoles that are generally inaccessible by known C&#8722;H alkenylation methods. This transformation accommodates a wide range of alkenyl carboxylic acids, including challenging conjugated polyene carboxylic acids, and diversely decorated imidazoles with high functional group compatibility. The presence of a removable pyrimidine directing group and the use of a bidentate phosphine ligand are pivotal to the success of the catalytic reaction. This process is also suitable for benzimidazoles. Importantly, the scalability and diversification of the products highlight the potential of this protocol in practical applications. Detailed experimental and computational studies provide important insights into the underlying reaction mechanism.

         <title>A Stereocontrolled Total Synthesis of Lipoxin B4 and its Biological Activity as a Pro&#8208;Resolving Lipid Mediator of Neuroinflammation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two stereocontrolled, efficient, and modular syntheses of eicosanoid lipoxin B4 (LXB4) are reported along with full spectral characterization of the natural product for the first time. Synthetic LXB4 exhibited significant neuroprotection in a cellular model of retinal ganglion cell survival assay. Our synthetic routes enable syntheses of new analogs and chemical probes for receptor and pathway identification.







Abstract
Two stereocontrolled, efficient, and modular syntheses of eicosanoid lipoxin B4 (LXB4) are reported. One features a stereoselective reduction followed by an asymmetric epoxidation sequence to set the vicinal diol stereocentres. The dienyne was installed via a one&#8208;pot Wittig olefination and base&#8208;mediated epoxide ring opening cascade. The other approach installed the diol through an asymmetric dihydroxylation reaction followed by a Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons olefination to afford the common dienyne intermediate. Finally, a Sonogashira coupling and an alkyne hydrosilylation/proto&#8208;desilylation protocol furnished LXB4 in 25&#8201;% overall yield in just 10&#8197;steps. For the first time, LXB4 has been fully characterized spectroscopically with its structure confirmed as previously reported. We have demonstrated that the synthesized LXB4 showed similar biological activity to commercial sources in a cellular neuroprotection model. This synthetic route can be employed to synthesize large quantities of LXB4, enable synthesis of new analogs, and chemical probes for receptor and pathway characterization.

         <title>Peroxynitrite&#8208;Promoted Persulfide Prodrugs with Protective Potential against Paracetamol Poisoning</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of novel persulfide prodrugs was designed and synthesized, which scavenged peroxynitrite in tandem during their activation. The 2&#8208;oxo&#8208;2&#8208;phenylacetamide triggers can first react with peroxynitrite and then initiate the release of persulfides, a second quencher of peroxynitrite. The prodrug intervention significantly reduced the intracellular concentration of APAP&#8208;induced peroxynitrite in HepG2 and alleviated the oxidative stress of H9c2 cardiac cells.







Abstract
The newly emerging persulfide prodrugs provide additional options for the profound study of persulfide, a fascinating molecule expected to intervene in biological functions and even diseases. Peroxynitrite is often the culprit in pathological processes characterized by oxidative stress, while the persulfide prodrug responsive to it is still pending. To enrich the family of redox&#8208;activated prodrugs, we designed prodrugs with a 2&#8208;oxo&#8208;2&#8208;phenylacetamide trigger, which achieved the release of persulfide via 1, 6&#8208;N, S&#8208;relay. The degradation of prodrugs and the formation of persulfides were confirmed to be peroxynitrite&#8208;responsible by the qualitative and quantitative studies based on LC&#8208;MS/MS methods and a spectrophotometry&#8208;based tag&#8208;switch strategy. Furthermore, these prodrugs showed potent peroxynitrite scavenging activity, cellular therapeutic potential against paracetamol poisoning in HepG2 and oxidative stress in H9c2, as well as desirable in vitro metabolic properties.

         <title>Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Anionic Fries Rearrangement Promoted by Lithium Amides under Aerobic Conditions in Sustainable Reaction Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, scalable, and sustainable access to salicylamides from O&#8208;aryl carbamates was achieved using lithium amides as easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle metalating agents under bench&#8208;type aerobic conditions. Tunable regioselective ortho&#8208; and lateral metalations in eco&#8208;friendly cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME) allow fast anionic migrations under air, with an unexpected beneficial contribution from biorenewable protic eutectic mixtures.







Abstract
A straightforward and efficient protocol to promote the metalation/anionic Fries rearrangements of O&#8208;aryl carbamates, using for the first time a lithium amide as metalating agent under aerobic/ambient&#8208;friendly reaction conditions, is reported. This approach enables the sustainable preparation of salicylamide derivatives with high levels of chemoselectivity within ultrafast reaction times, working at room temperature in the presence of air/moisture, and using environmentally responsible cyclopentyl methyl ether as a solvent. Furthermore, the regioselective manipulation of O&#8208;2&#8208;tolyl carbamates has been accomplished using interchangeably alkyllithiums or lithium amides, with an unexpected beneficial contribution from the employment of biorenewable protic eutectic mixtures as non&#8208;innocent reaction media.

         <title>Interfacial Charge Modulation via in situ Fabrication of 3D Conductive Platform with MOF Nanoparticles for Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photocatalyst was designed for CO2 reduction by assembling 3D GR with UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, aiming to construct a built&#8208;in electric field for charge separation. The composites show enhanced photocatalytic activity owing to improved distribution and exposure of absorption and reaction sites and redistribution of photogenerated carriers between 3D GR and UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2.

Highly&#8208;efficient photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into valuable carbon&#8208;contained chemicals possesses a tremendous potential in solving the energy crisis and global warming problem. However, the inadequate separation of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs and the unsatisfied capture of CO2 stay the chief roadblocks. Herein, we designed a novel photocatalyst for CO2 reduction by assembling three&#8208;dimensional graphene (3D GR) with a typical metal&#8208;organic framework material UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, aiming to construct a built&#8208;in electric field for charge separation as well as taking advantage of the typical 3D structure of GR for maximizing the exposed absorption site on the surface. The performance evaluation demonstrated that the photocatalytic activity has been improved for the composite materials compared with that of the pure UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. Further mechanism investigations proved that the enhanced photocatalytic performance is attributed to the synergy of enhanced CO2 absorption and inhibited photogenerated charge recombination, which could be owing to the better distribution and exposure of absorption and reaction sites on composites, and the redistribution of photogenerated carriers between 3D GR and UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. This study provides a promising pathway to probe nanocomposites based on MOFs in environmental improvement and other relevant fields.

         <title>Biomimetic Peptide Catalytic Bond&#8208;Forming Utilizing a Mild Br&#248;nsted Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid phase biomimetic catalytic peptide synthesis utilizing mild Br&#248;nsted acid without microwave irradiation was successfully applied under mild conditions. This paper introduces two methods for the 2&#8211;4 mer oligopeptides bond formation for batch reaction and flow synthesis at room temperature using organic solvents with boiling points below 100&#8201;&#176;C. This flow production process proposes this new production method to overcome the limited scale&#8208;up production by reaction device scale.







Abstract
Since the global peptide drug market demand has been predicted to increase, highly efficient and inexpensive mass scale peptides are required. However, the production process raises questions about the cost of energy input, scale&#8208;up production, raw materials, and solvents treatment. This paper introduces 2 methods for the 2&#8211;4 mer oligopeptides bond formation for batch reaction utilizing 50&#8211;100&#8197;mol% of a mild Br&#248;nsted acid under the mild condition. One of the methods has been capably adapted to flow synthesis at room temperature using organic solvents with boiling points below 100&#8201;&#176;C. The method applies the tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl amino methoxy group, forming the desired dipeptide without solvent at mild temperatures. Furthermore, the conversion of the carboxylic acid leaving the group to phenyl ester promotes peptide bond formation, and the reaction were applied to di, tri, and tetrapeptide bond formation in excellent yield without notable racemization at ambient temperature (up to &gt;99&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). Finally, this study proposes this new production method to overcome the limited scale&#8208;up production by reaction device scale: liquid phase biomimetic catalytic peptide flow synthesis utilizing a mild Br&#248;nsted acid.

         <title>Dynamic Amino Acid Side&#8208;Chains Grafting on Folded Peptide Backbone**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient access to large libraries of conformationally defined peptides is reported, using dynamic combinatorial chemistry as a tool to graft amino acid's side&#8208;chains in defined arrangement on a well&#8208;ordered 3D peptide scaffold. We report here the design of a chemical system that ensures the scrambling of side&#8208;chains on a pre&#8208;organized scaffold leading to an isoenergetic library useful for ligand screening.







Abstract
An efficient strategy for the synthesis of large libraries of conformationally defined peptides is reported, using dynamic combinatorial chemistry as a tool to graft amino acid side chains on a well&#8208;ordered 3D (3&#8208;dimension) peptide backbone. Combining rationally designed scaffolds with combinatorial side chains selection represents an alternative method to access peptide libraries for structures that are not genetically encodable. This method would allow a breakthrough for the discovery of protein mimetic for unconventional targets for which little is known.

         <dc:description>Asymmetric 1,2&#8208;carbamoyl rearrangement of lithiated 2&#8208;alkenyl carbamates has been investigated.

The substrate scope of the reaction was investigated with a variety of 2&#8208;alkenyl and benzyl oxazolidine carbamates. A stereochemical model is provided to explain the stereochemical outcome associated with the rearrangement. Acid&#8208;catalyzed removal of the chiral oxazolidine afforded &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acid in high optical purity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Owing to the unique catalytic, optical and magnetic properties  , lanthanides  (Ln) as multicomponent biomarkers, are widely used in the field of optical sensing, mass spectrometry and magnetic resonance imaging. As ligands, DNA molecules have good biocompatibility, high stability, cost efficiency, programmability and biodegradability. Based on the coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly between Ln ions (Ln  3+  ) and DNA molecules, a multifunctional Ln  3+  &#8208;DNA hybrid coordination polymers (CPs) were synthesized. Not only a series of different Ln  3+  (single Ln  3+  ) and DNA hybrid CPs were synthesized, but one hybrid CP contains two kinds of Ln  3+  was obtained. Besides, the synthetic CPs in cell fluorescence imaging and miRNA sensing also exhibited high performance. This work provides a novel idea for the synthesis of DNA based nanomaterials, which is promising for biologically&#8208;related applications.</dc:description>

         <title>When Aggregation Induced Emission Meets Perovskites: Efficient Defect&#8208;Passivation and Charge&#8208;Transfer for Ambient Fabrication of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intrinsic defects in perovskite film can serve as non&#8208;radiative recombination center to limit the performance and stability of metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The additive engineering in perovskite film is always applied to produce high&#8208;efficiency PSCs in recent years. Here, a typical donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) structured aggregation induced emission (AIE) molecule tetraphenylethene&#8208;2&#8208;dicyano&#8208;methylene&#8208;3&#8208;cyano&#8208;4,5,5&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;dihydrofuran (TPE&#8208;TCF) was introduced into perovskite film. The D&#8208;A structure of TPE&#8208;TCF molecule provided additional charge transfer channels, contributing to transporting electron of TPE&#8208;TCF&#8208;based device. The cyano (C&#8801;N) of TPE&#8208;TCF can interact with the uncoordinated Pb to from a relatively stable intermediate, PbI  2  &#8729;TPE&#8208;TCF, resulting in the slower crystal growth, reduced the defects at the grain boundaries and suppressed carrier recombination. As a consequence, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of TPE&#8208;TCF&#8208;modified PSCs achieved a remarkably enhanced from 15.63% to 19.66% with negligible hysteresis, which was prominent in methylammonium lead iodide&#8208;based devices fabricated under ambient condition. Furthermore, the PSCs modified by AIE molecule possessed an outstanding stability and maintain about 86% of the initial PCE after 300 hours storage in air at 25&#8208;35 &#176;C with a high relative humidity (RH) of &#8776;85%. This work suggests that incorporating AIE molecule into perovskite is a promising strategy for facilitating high&#8208;performance PSCs commercialization in ambient environment without glove box.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;long Lived Luminescent Triplet Excited States in Cyclic (Alkyl)(amino)carbene Complexes of Zn(II) Halides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high element abundance and d  10  electron configuration make Zn  II  &#8208;based compounds attractive candidates for the development of novel photoactive molecules. Although a large library of purely fluorescent compounds exists, emission involving triplet excited states is a rare phenomenon for zinc complexes. We have investigated the photophysical and &#8208;chemical properties of a series of dimeric and monomeric Zn  II  halide complexes bearing a cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (cAAC) as chromophore unit. Specifically, [(cAAC)XZn(&#956;&#8208;X)  2  ZnX(cAAC)] (X = Cl (  1  ), Br (  2  ), I (  3  )) and [ZnX  2  (cAAC)(NCMe)] (X = Br (  4  ), I (  5  )) were isolated and fully characterized, showing intense visible light photoluminescence under UV irradiation at 297 K and fast photo&#8208;induced transformation. At 77 K, the compounds exhibit improved stability allowing to record ultra&#8208;long lifetimes in the millisecond regime. DFT/MRCI calculations confirm that the emission stems from  3  XCT/LE  cAAC  states and indicate the phototransformation to be related to asymmetric distortion of the complexes by cAAC ligand rotation. This study enhances our understanding of the excited state properties for future development and application of new classes of Zn  II  phosphorescent complexes.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zeolitic octahedral metal oxides are inorganic crystalline microporous materials with adsorption and redox properties. New  &#949;  &#8208;Keggin nickel molybdate based zeolitic octahedral metal oxides are synthesized.  31  P nuclear magnetic resonance shows that reduction of Mo  VI  based molybdates forms  &#949;  &#8208;Keggin polyoxometalate that immediately transfers to solid phase. The formation process investigation indicates that low Ni concentration, insoluble reducing agent, and long synthesis time are the critical factors for obtaining the zeolite octahedral metal oxides rather than the  &#949;  &#8208;Keggin polyoxometalate molecule. The synthesized zeolitic nickel molybdate with Na  +  is used as the adsorbent, which effectively separates C  2  hydrocarbon mixtures.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigations on the Synthesis, Reactivity, and Properties of Perfluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Benzo&#8208;Fused BOPHY Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated BOPHY derivatives were synthesized and investigated as imaging and sensing probes. One such BOPHY displays a significantly red&#8208;shifted absorption/emission as a consequence of its planar geometry due to intramolecular hydrogen bond interactions. Another BOPHY derivative undergoes a reversible color change and fluorescence quenching in the presence of bases. Thiols, including cysteine and thioglucose, react efficiently with BOPHYs via regioselective aromatic fluorine substitution.







Abstract
The synthesis and reactivity of 3,8&#8208;dibromo&#8208;dodecafluoro&#8208;benzo&#8208;fused BOPHY 2 are reported, via SNAr with O&#8208;, N&#8208; S&#8208; and C&#8208;nucleophiles, and in Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions (Suzuki and Stille). The resulting perfluoro&#8208;BOPHY derivatives were investigated for their reactivity in the presence of various nucleophiles. BOPHY 3 displays reversible color change and fluorescence quenching in the presence of bases (Et3N, DBU), whereas BOPHY 7 reacts preferentially at the &#945;&#8208;pyrrolic positions, and BOPHY 8 undergoes regioselective fluorine substitution in the presence of thiols. The structural and electronic features of the fluorinated BOPHYs were studied by TD&#8208;DFT computations. In addition, their spectroscopic and cellular properties were investigated; BOPHY 10 shows the most red&#8208;shifted absorption/emission (&#955;max 659/699&#8197;nm) and 7 the highest fluorescence (&#934;f=0.95), while all compounds studied showed low cytotoxicity toward human HEp2 cells and were efficiently internalized.

A composite of 2D GeSe2/N&#8208;rGO is fabricated via a simple hydrothermal method combined with post&#8208;selenization process, and shows superb rate capability and excellent cycling stability. The electrochemical reaction mechanism is also revealed by the in situ XRD, indicating that the conversion reaction has played a certain part in Li+ storage.







Abstract
A composite of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) GeSe2 nanosheets dispersed on N&#8208;doped reduced graphene oxide (GeSe2/N&#8208;rGO) is fabricated via a simple hydrothermal method combined with post&#8208;selenization process. The high electronic conductivity and the substantial void spaces of the wrinkled N&#8208;rGO can improve the electrical conductivity of the active material and accommodate the volume evolution of GeSe2 nanosheets during the (de)lithiation processes, while GeSe2 nanosheets can reduce ion diffusion length effectively. Meanwhile, the unique layered structure is beneficial to the contact of the active material and electrolyte, and the reversibility of conversion reaction has also been improved. Furthermore, kinetics analysis reveals a pseudocapacitance&#8208;dominated Li+&#8208;storage mechanism at high rates. In&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis discloses that the conversion reaction has played a certain part in Li+&#8208;storage. Thus, the GeSe2/N&#8208;rGO composite delivers excellent rate capability and good long&#8208;term stability with a high reversible capacity of 711.0&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

Abstract
The oxonitridosilicate La7Sr[Si10N19O3]&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ and its substitutional variants RE8&#8208;xAEx[Si10N20&#8208;xO2+x]&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ with RE=La, Ce; AE=Ca, Sr, Ba and 0&#8804;x&#8804;2 were synthesized starting from REN, SrN/Ca3N2/Ba2N, SiO2, amorphous Si3N4 and Eu2O3 as doping agent at 1600&#8201;&#176;C in a radiofrequency furnace. The crystal structure of La7Sr[Si10N19O3] was solved and refined based on single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data. La7Sr[Si10N19O3] crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pmn21 (no. 31). The crystal structures of the isotypic compounds RE8&#8208;xAEx[Si10N20&#8208;xO2+x] were confirmed by Rietveld refinements based on powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data using the single&#8208;crystal data of La7Sr[Si10N19O3] as starting point. Crystal structure elucidation reveals a 3D network of vertex sharing SiN4 and SiN2(N1/2&#8208;x/4O1/2+x/4)2 (0&#8804;x&#8804;2) tetrahedra. When excited with UV to blue light, La7Sr[Si10N19O3]&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ shows amber luminescence with &#955;em=612&#8197;nm and fwhm=84&#8197;nm/2194&#8197;cm&#8722;1, which makes it interesting for application in amber phosphor&#8208;converted light emitting diodes.

         <title>Significant Effect of the Flexibility of Bridging Alkyl Chains on the Proximity of Stacked Porphyrin and Phthalocyanine Conjugated with a Fourfold Rotaxane Linkage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The uses of wobbly bridges: The effect of the flexibility of the bridging alkyl chains in a fourfold rotaxane heterodimer of porphyrin and phthalocyanine on the face&#8208;to&#8208;face distance between the two porphyrinoids has been examined. It was found that longer alkyl bridges with higher flexibility resulted in closer stacking of the two porphyrinoids, whereas shorter bridges hindered stacking because of their lower flexibility.







Abstract
Spatial distance is an important factor in controlling the functional interactions between molecular units in a conjugate; therefore, the bridging unit has been closely examined. Here, we examined the effect of the flexibility of bridging alkyl chains on the proximity of stacked porphyrin and phthalocyanine conjugated with a fourfold rotaxane linkage. We found that closely stacking two &#960; systems requires bridging alkyl chains above a certain length, and the shorter bridges hinder stacking because of their lower flexibility. The stacking distance between porphyrin and phthalocyanine in the conjugate with decyl (C10) chains was estimated to be 4.03&#8197;&#197; and showed a unique physical character arising from short&#8208;distance interactions. The longer alkyl chains minimized steric restriction inside the fourfold rotaxane and allowed efficient communication between the porphyrin and phthalocyanine units. This is due to the flexibility of the side chains.

         <title>Green&#8208;Light Activatable BODIPY and Coumarin 5&#8217;&#8208;Caps for Oligonucleotide Photocaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green&#8208;light absorbing BODIPY and coumarin derivatives can be used as phosphoramidites in oligonucleotide synthesis. CuAAC reactions allow cyclization and therefore fast photocaging or the introduction of other photolabile modification at those 5&#8217;&#8208;caps. Both caps are readily photocleaved within the green gap (530 and 565&#8197;nm), hence they avoid UV damage and offer deeper tissue penetration, especially in plants.







Abstract
We synthesized two green&#8208;light activatable 5&#8217;&#8208;caps for oligonucleotides based on the BODIPY and coumarin scaffold. Both bear an alkyne functionality allowing their use in numerous biological applications. They were successfully incorporated in oligonucleotides via solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Copper&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) using a bisazide photo&#8208;tether gave cyclic oligonucleotides that could be relinearized by activation with green light and were shown to exhibit high stability against exonucleases. Chemical ligation as another example for bioconjugation yielded oligonucleotides with an internal strand break site. Irradiation at 530&#8197;nm or 565&#8197;nm resulted in complete photolysis of both caging groups.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Green-light absorbing BODIPY&lt;/b&gt; and coumarin derivatives can be used as phosphoramidites in oligonucleotide synthesis. CuAAC reactions allow cyclization and therefore fast photocaging or the introduction of other photolabile modification at those 5&#8217;-caps. Both caps are readily photocleaved within the green gap (530 and 565&#8197;nm), hence they avoid UV damage and offer deeper tissue penetration, especially in plants.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We synthesized two green-light activatable 5&#8217;-caps for oligonucleotides based on the BODIPY and coumarin scaffold. Both bear an alkyne functionality allowing their use in numerous biological applications. They were successfully incorporated in oligonucleotides via solid-phase synthesis. Copper-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) using a bisazide photo-tether gave cyclic oligonucleotides that could be relinearized by activation with green light and were shown to exhibit high stability against exonucleases. Chemical ligation as another example for bioconjugation yielded oligonucleotides with an internal strand break site. Irradiation at 530&#8197;nm or 565&#8197;nm resulted in complete photolysis of both caging groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Modification of Aminoglycoside Antibiotics Overcomes Bacterial Resistance Mediated by APH(3&#8217;) Kinases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regioselective oxidation: A scalable catalytic alcohol oxidation of structurally complex 4,5&#8208; and 4,6&#8208;disubstituted aminoglycoside antibiotics is reported. Exploiting a palladium catalyst, this late&#8208;stage modification is extremely selective tackling only the hydroxyl group in 3&#8242;&#8208;position. Subsequent modification of the resulting ketone derivatives enables facile access to novel antibiotic candidates, in only four synthetic steps, which overcome bacterial resistance mediated by APH(3&#8217;)s.







Abstract
The continuous emergence of antimicrobial resistance is causing a threat to patients infected by multidrug&#8208;resistant pathogens. In particular, the clinical use of aminoglycoside antibiotics, broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterials of last resort, is limited due to rising bacterial resistance. One of the major resistance mechanisms in Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria is phosphorylation of these amino sugars at the 3&#8217;&#8208;position by O&#8208;phosphotransferases [APH(3&#8217;)s]. Structural alteration of these antibiotics at the 3&#8217;&#8208;position would be an obvious strategy to tackle this resistance mechanism. However, the access to such derivatives requires cumbersome multi&#8208;step synthesis, which is not appealing for pharma industry in this low&#8208;return&#8208;on&#8208;investment market. To overcome this obstacle and combat bacterial resistance mediated by APH(3&#8217;)s, we introduce a novel regioselective modification of aminoglycosides in the 3&#8217;&#8208;position via palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidation. To underline the effectiveness of our method for structural modification of aminoglycosides, we have developed two novel antibiotic candidates overcoming APH(3&#8217;)s&#8208;mediated resistance employing only four synthetic steps.

         <title>Genuine Pores in a Stable Zinc Phosphite for High H2 Adsorption and CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the shattered glass is an amazing view of Keelung city where the National Taiwan Ocean University is located. Like breaking a hole in a vacuum box, a new stable mixed&#8208;ligand zinc phosphite (NTOU&#8208;9) presents interesting structural features and pore characteristics for gas adsorption. This material also showed good adsorption capacity for H2O, CO2, CO, CH4, N2, and H2, as well as selectivity for CO2 over CO, N2, and H2 at 298&#8197;K. The possible adsorption sites and selectivity were calculated by using density functional theory (DFT), the ideal adsorption solution theory (IAST), and fitting experimental pure&#8208;component adsorption data. More information can be found in the Research Article by C.&#8208;M. Wang and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200732).

         <dc:description>An efficient, metal&#8208;free, catalyst&#8208;free and solvent&#8208;free methodology for the reductive amination of levulinic acid with different anilines has been developed using HBpin as the reducing reagent.

It is also the first report for the synthesis of different pyrrolidones by solvent&#8208;free as well as catalyst&#8208;free methods.

         <title>The significant role of the atomic surface structure of support in strong metal&#8208;support interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supported metal catalysts are important in many industrial reactions. It is reported that support materials are not always inert, and in some cases could even interact with metal nanoparticles (NPs) actively via various ways. In particular, the strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI), referring to metal NPs covered by support materials, affects catalysis at the active sites on the metal NP surface, which can serve as a very effective method in tuning and improving catalytic performance. By tailoring the support materials or controlling the treatment processes,  different kinds of SMSI, such as  classical SMSI, oxidative SMSI, wet&#8208;chemistry SMSI, and adsorbate&#8208;mediated SMSI  , can be achieved. This concept summarizes the general strategies to tune SMSI and discusses the key results. Moreover, a new proposal is presented to tailor SMSI by combining both the exposed facets of the support materials and external environments. Furthermore, we have discussed the challenges faced at present and provide useful insights for future research concerning this topic.</dc:description>

The promising electrochromic features of both small molecules and conjugated polymers led to the assembly and investigation of electrochromic devices, evidencing the materials&#8217; versatility, applied in such different approaches as electrochromic windows and electroluminescent devices. Furthermore, the assembled OLEDs provided high efficiencies, with small roll&#8208;off, EQEs up to 20.5% and luminance values up to 85 000 cd/m  2  .</dc:description>

Spiro[cyclobutene&#8208;1,9&#8242;&#8208;fluorene] framework is effectively constructed from easily available biaryl&#8208;alkynes through a two&#8208;step protocol including selective (2+2) cycloaddition with in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated Tf2C=CH2 and HFIP&#8208;promoted desulfinative spirocyclisation.







Abstract
A two&#8208;step synthesis of less accessible spiro[cyclobutene&#8208;1,9&#8242;&#8208;fluorene] compounds from biaryl&#8208;alkynes and 2&#8208;(2&#8208;fluoropyridin&#8208;1&#8208;ium&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,1&#8208;bis((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;ide, which serves as a potent precursor for outstandingly electrophilic Tf2C=CH2, has been developed. This synthetic methodology includes selective formation of gem&#8208;bis(triflyl)cyclobutenes from biaryl&#8208;alkynes and Tf2C=CH2 followed by desulfinative spirocyclisation mediated by 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol (HFIP). Besides, on the basis of the chameleonic reactivity of sulfone functionality, several derivatisations of triflylated spiro[cyclobutene&#8208;1,9&#8242;&#8208;fluorene] products have been successfully achieved.

         <title>Chemically modified poly(A) analogs targeting PABP: structure activity relationship and translation inhibitory properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly(A)&#8208;binding protein (PABP) is an essential element of cellular translational machinery. Recent studies have revealed that poly(A) tail modifications can modulate mRNA stability and translational potential, and that oligoadenylate&#8208;derived PABP ligands can act as effective translational inhibitors with potential applications in pain management. Although extensive research has focused on protein&#8208;RNA and protein&#8208;protein interactions involving PABPs, further studies are required to examine the ligand specificity of PABP. In this study, we developed a microscale thermophoresis&#8208;based assay to probe the interactions between PABP and oligoadenylate analogs containing different chemical modifications. Using this method, we evaluated oligoadenylate analogs modified with nucleobase, ribose, and phosphate moieties to identify modification hotspots. In addition, we determined the susceptibility of the modified oligos to CNOT7 to identify those with the potential for increased cellular stability. Consequently, we selected two enzymatically stable oligoadenylate analogs that inhibit translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates with a higher potency than a previously reported PABP ligand. We believe that the results presented in this study and the implemented methodology can be capitalized upon in the future development of RNA&#8208;based biological tools.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding, Release and Functionalization of Intact Pnictogen Tetrahedra Coordinated to Dicopper Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bridging MeCN ligand in the dicopper(I) complexes [(DPFN)Cu2(&#956;,&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;MeCN)][X]2 (X = weakly coordinating anion, &#160;NTf2 (1a), FAl[OC6F10(C6F5)]3 (1b), Al[OC(CF3)3]4 (1c)) was replaced by white phosphorus (P4) or yellow arsenic (As4) to yield [(DPFN)Cu2(&#956;,&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;E4)][X]2 (E = P (2a&#8208;c), As (3a&#8208;c)). The molecular structures in the solid state reveal novel coordination modes for E4 tetrahedra bonded to coinage metal ions. Experimental data and quantum chemical computations provide information concerning perturbations to the bonding in coordinated E4 tetrahedra. Reactions with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) led to replacement of the E4 tetrahedra with release of P4 or As4 and formation of [(DPFN)Cu2(&#956;,&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;MeNHC)][X]2 (4a,b) or to an opening of one E&#8208;E bond leading to an unusual E4 butterfly structural motif in [(DPFN)Cu2(&#956;,&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;E4DippNHC)][X]2 (E = P (5a,b), E = As (6)). With a cyclic alkyl amino carbene (EtCAAC), cleavage of two As&#8208;As bonds was observed to give two isomers of [(DPFN)Cu2(&#181;,&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;As4EtCAAC)][X]2 (7a,b) with an unusual As4&#8208;triangle+1 unit.</dc:description>

Reactions with N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) led to replacement of the E4 tetrahedra with release of P4 or As4 and formation of [(DPFN)Cu2(&#956;,&#951;1:&#951;1-MeNHC)][X]2 (4a,b) or to an opening of one E-E bond leading to an unusual E4 butterfly structural motif in [(DPFN)Cu2(&#956;,&#951;1:&#951;1-E4DippNHC)][X]2 (E = P (5a,b), E = As (6)). With a cyclic alkyl amino carbene (EtCAAC), cleavage of two As-As bonds was observed to give two isomers of [(DPFN)Cu2(&#181;,&#951;2:&#951;2-As4EtCAAC)][X]2 (7a,b) with an unusual As4-triangle+1 unit.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Layered Uranyl Phosphonates Encapsulating Co(II)/Mn(II)/Zn(II) Ions: Exfoliation into Nanosheets and Its Impact on Magnetic and Luminescent Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered heterometallic 5f&#8208;3d uranyl phosphonates can exhibit unique luminescent and/or magnetic properties, but the fabrication and properties of their 2D counterparts have not been investigated. Herein we report three heterobimetallic uranyl phosphonates, namely, [(UO2)3M(2&#8208;pmbH)4(H2O)4]&#183;2H2O [MU, M = Co(II), CoU; Mn(II), MnU; Zn(II), ZnU; 2&#8208;pmbH3 = 2&#8208;(phosphonomethyl)benzoic acid]. They are isostructural and display two&#8208;dimensional layered structures where the M(II) centers are encapsulated inside the windows generated by the diamagnetic uranyl phosphonate layer. Each M(II) has an octahedral geometry filled with four water molecules in the equatorial positions and two phosphonate oxygen atoms in the axial positions. The uranium atoms adopt UO7 pentagonal bipyramidal and UO6 square bipyramidal geometries. The lattice and coordination water molecules can be released by thermal treatment and reabsorbed in a reversible manner, accompanied with changes of magnetic dynamics. Interestingly, the bulk samples of MU can be exfoliated in acetone via freezing and thawing processes forming nanosheets with single&#8208;layer or two&#8208;layer thickness (MU&#8208;ns). Magnetic studies revealed that the CoU and MnU systems exhibited field&#8208;induced slow magnetization relaxation at low temperature. Compared with crystalline CoU, the magnetic relaxation of the CoU&#8208;ns aggregates is significantly accelerated. Moreover, photoluminescence measured at 77 K showed slight red&#8208;shift of the five characteristic uranyl emission bands for ZnU&#8208;ns in comparison with those of the crystalline ZnU. This work gives the first examples of 2D materials based on 5f&#8208;3d heterometallic uranyl phosphonates and illustrates the impact of dimension reduction on their magnetic/optical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>How Ionization Catalyzes Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Let's get radical! Quantum chemical activation strain analyses reveal how ionization of a dienophile can effectively catalyze the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction by reducing the Pauli repulsion and simultaneously enhancing the orbital interactions. This study nicely demonstrates the similarities and differences between radical&#8208;cation and Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed Diels&#8208;Alder reactions.







Abstract
The catalytic effect of ionization on the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between 1,3&#8208;butadiene and acrylaldehyde has been studied using relativistic density functional theory (DFT). Removal of an electron from the dienophile, acrylaldehyde, significantly accelerates the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction and shifts the reaction mechanism from concerted asynchronous for the neutral Diels&#8208;Alder reaction to stepwise for the radical&#8208;cation Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. Our detailed activation strain and Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital analyses reveal how ionization of the dienophile enhances the Diels&#8208;Alder reactivity via two mechanisms: (i) by amplifying the asymmetry in the dienophile's occupied &#960;&#8208;orbitals to such an extent that the reaction goes from concerted asynchronous to stepwise and thus with substantially less steric (Pauli) repulsion per reaction step; (ii) by enhancing the stabilizing orbital interactions that result from the ability of the singly occupied molecular orbital of the radical&#8208;cation dienophile to engage in an additional three&#8208;electron bonding interaction with the highest occupied molecular orbital of the diene.

         <title>On the Mediated Electron Transfer of Immobilized Galactose Oxidase for Biotechnological Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzymatic bioelectrode made up of galactose oxidase electrically wired with a redox polymer was used for the electrocatalytic oxidation of bio&#8208;renewable substrates with minimal influence from ambient O2. A practical example for the conversion of glycerol and 5&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)furfural in a circular flow&#8208;through setup is shown. The products were inspected to evaluate the possibility of substrate over&#8208;oxidation during enzymatic catalysis. More information can be found in the Research Article by W. Schuhmann, F. Conzuelo and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200868).

         <title>Enhanced Cycling Performance of All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li&#8208;S Battery Enabled by PVP&#8208;Blended PEO&#8208;Based Double&#8208;Layer Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PEO&#8208;based Double&#8208;layer solid electrolyte was fabricated through casting method. PVP distributed into PEO layer contacting with cathode promotes the dissolution of lithium salts and forms lithium bonds with (LiPSs). The double&#8208;layer solid electrolytes can ameliorate the shuttle effect of LiPSs better than pure PEO electrolytes.







Abstract
Despite the high specific capacity of Li&#8722;S battery, shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and safety issue pose a great challenge to realize its commercial application. Replacing liquid electrolyte with poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) &#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolyte is considered as a promising method to boost the safety, but the shuttle effect of LiPSs cannot be completely eliminated. In this work, a new kind of double&#8208;layer PEO&#8208;based polymer electrolyte is designed to restrict the LiPSs. The layer next to cathode consists of PEO and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP). The other layer consists of PEO. PVP with abundant of amide groups has been proved to have strong affinity to LiPSs. The strong interaction between LiPSs and carbonyl groups in amide is verified by Attenuated Total Reflection&#8208;Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy tests. As a result, the assembled Li&#8722;S battery exhibits a specific capacity of 1100&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and capacity retention of 347&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles at 60&#8201;&#176;C and 0.05&#8197;C, while the capacity retention of the battery without PVP&#8208;blended PEO electrolyte remains only 27&#8201;% at the same conditions.

         <title>Hierarchically Porous Poly(ionic liquid)&#8208;Organic Cage Composite Membrane for Efficient Iodine Capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The effective capture of iodine with high volatility and poisonousness is significant for reprocessing the spent nuclear fuel. In this article, we report a hierarchically porous poly(ionic liquid)&#8208;organic cage composite membrane (PIL@CC3) possessing a gradient content distribution of CC3 cage crystals throughout the membrane to capture iodine vapor. The introduction of microporous CC3 can significantly enhance the uptake capacity of iodine up to 980 mg g  &#8208;1  , which is superior to that of a pristine PIL membrane carrying large meso&#8208; and macropores (99 mg g  &#8208;1  ), and CC3 crystalline powder (662 mg g  &#8208;1  ). Such enhanced performance benefits from the micro&#8208;meso&#8208;macroporous structure of the PIL@CC3 membrane in which the large meso&#8208; and macropores facilitate the mass transfer of iodine molecules from the external environment into the surface of the CC3 crystal, followed by diffusion of iodine molecules from the CC3 surface into the interior and exterior pores of the CC3 crystal. In addition, the asymmetric distribution of CC3 crystals across the PIL@CC3 membrane also displays its advantage in intercepting trace iodine, revealing its great potential for practical application. This study provides an idea for constructing hierarchically porous membrane composites for the removal of toxic vapors.</dc:description>

         <title>Relevance of Palladium to Radiopharmaceutical Development Considering Enhanced Coordination Properties of TE1PA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The limited use of palladium&#8208;103 and &#8208;109 radionuclides for molecular radiotherapy is surely due to the lack of appropriate ligands capable of fulfilling all criteria required for application in nuclear medicine. Furthermore, the thermodynamic properties of these complexes in solution remain difficult to establish. The challenge is compounded when considering that radiolabelling of compounds for translation to the clinical trials requires fast complexation. Thus, the coordination of Pd(II) and  103/109  Pd&#8208;nuclides is a huge challenge in terms of molecular design and physicochemical characterization. Herein, we report a comprehensive study highlighting TE1PA, a monopicolinate cyclam &#8211; already established in nuclear imaging with  64  Cu&#8208;PET (positron emission tomography) imaging tracers &#8211; as a highly relevant chelator for natural Pd and subsequently  109  Pd&#8208;nuclide. The structural, thermodynamic, kinetic and radiolabelling studies of Pd(II) with  TE1PA  , as well as the comparison of this complex with three structurally related derivatives, support palladium&#8208;  TE1PA  radiopharmaceuticals as leading candidates for targeted nuclear medicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis and Biological Applications of Peptidoglycan Fragments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The biosynthesis, breakdown, and modification of peptidoglycan (PG) play vital roles in both bacterial viability and in the response of human physiology to bacterial infection. Studies on PG biochemistry are hampered by the fact that PG is an inhomogeneous insoluble macromolecule. Chemical synthesis is therefore an important means to obtain PG fragments that may serve as enzyme substrates and elicitors of the human immune response. This review outlines the recent advances in the synthesis and biochemical studies of PG fragments, PG biosynthetic intermediates (such as Park's nucleotides and PG lipids), and PG breakdown products (such as muramyl dipeptides and anhydro&#8208;muramic acid&#8208;containing fragments). A rich variety of synthetic approaches has been applied to preparing such compounds since carbohydrate, peptide, and phospholipid chemical methodologies must all be applied.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrathin Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets Based on Halogen&#8208;Substituted Porphyrin Ligand: Synthesis and Catalytic Application in CO2 Reductive Amination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets have emerged as a promising kind of heterogeneous catalysts. Herein, we report a series of 2D porphyrinic metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets (X&#8208;PMOF, X = F, Cl, Br), which was prepared from the self&#8208;assembly of a halogen&#8208;based porphyrin ligand X&#8208;TCPP (X&#8208;TCPP = 5&#8208;(4&#8208;halogenatedphenyl)&#8208;10,15,20&#8208;tris(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)&#8208;porphyrin) and ZrCl 4 in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid as the modulating reagent. The framework of X&#8208;PMOF possessed the ftw topology as in MOF&#8208;525. The lamellar X&#8208;PMOF nanosheets with the thickness of down to 4.5 nm were assembled and aggregated into flower&#8208;like morphology. With the introduction of iridium(III) atoms into the porphyrin rings, the resultant X&#8208;PMOF(Ir) nanosheets were prepared via the similar method. Catalytic results show that Br&#8208;PMOF(Ir) nanosheets were highly efficient for CO 2 reduction and aminolysis, giving rise to formamides in high yields under room temperature and atmospheric pressure, and can be recycled and reused for 3 runs. The total turnover number of Br&#8208;PMOF(Ir) after 3 runs was 1644 based on Ir. Mechanistic studies disclose that the high efficiency of Br&#8208;PMOF(Ir) nanosheets was ascribed to three factors, including the superior activation capability of iridium(III) porphyrin for Si&#8722;H bonds, more active sites on the external surfaces of Br&#8208;PMOF(Ir) nanosheets, and the defects caused by unsymmetrical porphyrin ligand that increased the framework&#8217;s affinity towards CO 2 .</dc:description>

         <title>How the Chalcogen Atom Size Dictates the Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Donor Capability of Carboxamides, Thioamides, and Selenoamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Our newly developed theory for quantitative prediction of the amide hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;donor capability by means of the energy of the &#960;*C=X level has the potential to contribute to the development of novel and improved hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;donor organocatalysts and hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular materials.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202200755).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are Celine Nieuwland and C&#233;lia Fonseca Guerra of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. The image depicts how the increasing atom size of the chalcogen from O to S to Se elongates the carbon&#8211;chalcogen bond in amides due to the increase in the steric Pauli repulsion and thereby enhances the amide hydrogen&#8208;bond donor strength.

         <title>Exploring the Reactivity of B&#8208;Connected Carboranylphosphines in Frustrated Lewis Pair Chemistry: A New Frame for a Classic System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel B9&#8208;connected secondary carboranylphosphines were obtained and subsequently treated with B(C6F5)3 to give zwitterionic compounds. Frustrated Lewis pairs, capable of splitting dihydrogen, could either be obtained directly by reaction with Grignard reagents or through thermal elimination of H2 after a H&#8722;F exchange. Hydrolysis of the B&#8722;C6F4 bond in the frustrated Lewis pair gave the first tertiary B&#8208;carboranyl phosphines with three distinct substituents.







Abstract
The primary phosphines MesPH2 and tBuPH2 react with 9&#8208;iodo&#8208;m&#8208;carborane yielding B9&#8208;connected secondary carboranylphosphines 1,7&#8208;H2C2B10H9&#8208;9&#8208;PHR (R=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2 (Mes; 1&#8201;a), tBu (1&#8201;b)). Addition of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (BCF) to 1&#8201;a, b resulted in the zwitterionic compounds 1,7&#8208;H2C2B10H9&#8208;9&#8208;PHR(p&#8208;C6F4)BF(C6F5)2 (2&#8201;a, b) through nucleophilic para substitution of a C6F5 ring followed by fluoride transfer to boron. Further reaction with Me2SiHCl prompted a H&#8722;F exchange yielding the zwitterionic compounds 1,7&#8208;H2C2B10H9&#8208;9&#8208;PHR(p&#8208;C6F4)BH(C6F5)2 (3&#8201;a, b). The reaction of 2&#8201;a, b with one equivalent of R'MgBr (R&#8217;=Me, Ph) gave the extremely water&#8208;sensitive frustrated Lewis pairs 1,7&#8208;H2C2B10H9&#8208;9&#8208;PR(p&#8208;C6F4)B(C6F5)2 (4&#8201;a, b). Hydrolysis of the B&#8722;C6F4 bond in 4&#8201;a, b gave the first tertiary B&#8208;carboranyl phosphines with three distinct substituents, 1,7&#8208;H2C2B10H9&#8208;9&#8208;PR(p&#8208;C6F4H) (5&#8201;a, b). Deprotonation of the zwitterionic compounds 2&#8201;a, b and 3&#8201;a, b formed anionic phosphines [1,7&#8208;H2C2B10H9&#8208;9&#8208;PR(p&#8208;C6F4)BX(C6F5)2]&#8722;[DMSOH]+ (R=Mes, X=F (6&#8201;a), R=tBu, X=F (6&#8201;b); R=Mes, X=H (7&#8201;a), R=tBu, X=H (7&#8201;b)). Reaction of 2&#8201;a, b with an excess of Grignard reagents resulted in the addition of R&#8217; at the boron atom yielding the anions [1,7&#8208;H2C2B10H9&#8208;9&#8208;PR(p&#8208;C6F4)BR&#8217;(C6F5)2]&#8722; (R=Mes, R&#8217;=Me (8&#8201;a), R=tBu, R&#8217;=Me (8&#8201;b); R=Mes, R&#8217;=Ph (9&#8201;a), R=tBu, R&#8217;=Ph (9&#8201;b)) with [MgBr(Et2O)n]+ as counterion. The ability of the zwitterionic compounds 3&#8201;a, b to hydrogenate imines as well as the Br&#248;nsted acidity of 3&#8201;a were investigated.

         <title>Manipulation of Triplet Excited States in Two&#8208;Component Systems for High&#8208;Performance Organic Afterglow Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;component design strategy, in which a second component modulates the excited&#8208;state property of the first component, has emerged as an important method for the fabrication of high&#8208;performance organic afterglow materials under ambient conditions. Recent achievements in organic afterglow efficiency, emission lifetimes and brightness by a two&#8208;component design strategy are reviewed.







Abstract
The past several years have witnessed the tremendous development of novel chemical structures, new design strategies and intriguing applications in the field of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and organic afterglow materials. This Review article focuses on recent advancements of high&#8208;performance organic afterglow materials obtained by two&#8208;component design strategies such as a dopant&#8208;matrix, donor&#8211;acceptor, sensitization, and energy&#8208;transfer strategies. Based on some cutting&#8208;edge studies, organic afterglow efficiency has been largely improved, exceeding 90&#8201;% in several cases. Organic afterglow durations reach tens of seconds in phosphorescence systems and hours in donor&#8211;acceptor systems. Organic afterglow brightness outcompetes some inorganic afterglow materials in the first several seconds after ceasing excitation source. Organic afterglow colors cover the whole visible regions and extend to near&#8208;infrared regions with respectful afterglow efficiency. On the basis of these achievements, researchers demonstrate promising applications of organic afterglow materials in diverse fields, which has also been reviewed.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of An Aluminosilicate POS Zeolite with Intersecting 12&#215;11&#215;11&#8208;Member&#8208;Ring Pore Channels by Using a Designed Organic Structure&#8208;Directing Agent</title>

         <dc:description>
Pure silica and aluminosilicate zeolites NUD&#8208;14 are directly synthesized by using a designed cation 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;4&#8208;phenylpyridinium as an organic structure&#8208;directing agent, which show excellent acid and hydrothermal stabilities superior to their counterpart germanosilicate POS zeolite. The incorporation of Al into the zeolite framework makes the Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;14 zeolite possess medium and strong acidities, providing a platform for exploring its size&#8208; and shape&#8208;selective catalytic applications.







Abstract
Large and extra&#8208;large pore zeolites have been widely applied in industrial areas as catalysts, adsorbents, etc. Among them, silica and/or aluminosilicate zeolites have been attracted great attention due to their excellent hydrothermal stability and strong acidity. However, a great deal of zeolite structures are still not available in the form of silica and/or aluminosilicate. Herein, we report the synthesis of pure silica and aluminosilicate large&#8208;pore zeolites, denoted as NUD&#8208;14 and Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;14, respectively, by using a designed cation 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;4&#8208;phenylpyridinium as an organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA). NUD&#8208;14 has an intersecting 12&#215;11&#215;11&#8208;member ring pore system, which is isostructural to the germanosilicate PUK&#8208;16 zeolite with a POS topology. The OSDAs can be completely removed from the framework by calcination. NUD&#8208;14 and Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;14 possess excellent acid and hydrothermal stabilities, superior to the germanosilicate POS zeolite. The incorporation of Al into the zeolite framework makes the Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;14 zeolite possess medium and strong acidities. The successful synthesis of NUD&#8208;14 consisting of a rare odd&#8208;member ring pore structure may provide a platform for interesting size&#8208; and shape&#8208;selective catalytic applications.

         <title>A Single Bioinspired Hexameric Nickel Catechol&#8211;Alloxazine Catalyst Combines Metal and Radical Mechanisms for Alkene Hydrosilylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual metal and radical reactivity is enabled by a polymetallic nickel complex merging alloxazine and catechol redox&#8208;active subunits. This is the first catalytic application of an alloxazine 3d metal complex and this complex promotes silyl radical generation and chain walking of internal alkenes.







Abstract
Mechanisms combining organic radicals and metallic intermediates hold strong potential in homogeneous catalysis. Such activation modes require careful optimization of two interconnected processes: one for the generation of radicals and one for their productive integration towards the final product. We report that a bioinspired polymetallic nickel complex can combine ligand&#8208; and metal&#8208;centered reactivities to perform fast hydrosilylation of alkenes under mild conditions through an unusual dual radical&#8208; and metal&#8208;based mechanism. This earth&#8208;abundant polymetallic complex incorporating a catechol&#8208;alloxazine motif as redox&#8208;active ligand operates at low catalyst loading (0.25&#8197;mol%) and generates silyl radicals and a nickel&#8208;hydride intermediate through a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) step. Evidence of an isomerization sequence enabling terminal hydrosilylation of internal alkenes points towards the involvement of the nickel&#8208;hydride species in chain walking. This single catalyst promotes a hybrid pathway by combining synergistically ligand and metal participation in both inner&#8208; and outer&#8208; sphere processes.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Reductive Amination of Ketones and Secondary Amines: Breaking the Aliphatic Wall</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The elusive direct reductive amination between aliphatic amines and aliphatic ketones is reported. This was achieved by using a diphosphine&#8208;coordinated iridium catalyst. The applicability and functional&#8208;group tolerance were demonstrated by the synthesis of a panel of tertiary amines relevant for medicinal chemistry research. This methodology is promising for implementation in late&#8208;stage functionalization and repurposing current retrosynthetic schemes.







Abstract
Direct reductive amination (DRA) is a ubiquitous reaction in organic chemistry. This transformation between a carbonyl group and an amine is most often achieved by using a super stoichiometric amount of hazardous hydride reagents, thus being incompatible with many sensitive functional groups. DRA could also be achieved by means of chemo&#8208; or biocatalysis, thereby attracting the interest of industry as well as academic laboratories due to the virtually perfect atom economy. Although DRAs are well&#8208;established for substrate pairs such as aldehydes with either 1&#176; or 2&#176; amines as well as ketones with 1&#176; amines, the current methodologies are limited in the case of ketones with 2&#176; amines. Herein, we present a general DRA protocol that overcomes this major limitation by means of iridium catalysis. The applicability of the methodology is demonstrated by accessing an unprecedented range of biologically relevant tertiary amines starting from both aliphatic ketones and aliphatic amines.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The elusive direct reductive amination&lt;/b&gt; between aliphatic amines and aliphatic ketones is reported. This was achieved by using a diphosphine-coordinated iridium catalyst. The applicability and functional-group tolerance were demonstrated by the synthesis of a panel of tertiary amines relevant for medicinal chemistry research. This methodology is promising for implementation in late-stage functionalization and repurposing current retrosynthetic schemes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct reductive amination (DRA) is a ubiquitous reaction in organic chemistry. This transformation between a carbonyl group and an amine is most often achieved by using a super stoichiometric amount of hazardous hydride reagents, thus being incompatible with many sensitive functional groups. DRA could also be achieved by means of chemo- or biocatalysis, thereby attracting the interest of industry as well as academic laboratories due to the virtually perfect atom economy. Although DRAs are well-established for substrate pairs such as aldehydes with either 1&#176; or 2&#176; amines as well as ketones with 1&#176; amines, the current methodologies are limited in the case of ketones with 2&#176; amines. Herein, we present a general DRA protocol that overcomes this major limitation by means of iridium catalysis. The applicability of the methodology is demonstrated by accessing an unprecedented range of biologically relevant tertiary amines starting from both aliphatic ketones and aliphatic amines.

         <title>On the Fundamental Polymer Chemistry of Inverse Vulcanization for Statistical and Segmented Copolymers from Elemental Sulfur</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The detailed discussion of the fundamental and polymerization mechanism for sulfur copolymers is described from ring&#8208;opening polymerization, inverse vulcanization, dynamic covalent polymerization. In this article, we highlight the segmented sulfur polyurethane with flame retardancy through post&#8208;polymerization of sulfur copolymers. And we give the prospects for various applications of sulfur derived polymers.







Abstract
In this concept review, the fundamental and polymerization chemistry of inverse vulcanization for the preparation of statistical and segmented sulfur copolymers, which have been actively developed and advanced in various applications over the past decade is discussed. This concept review delves into a discussion of step&#8208;growth polymerization constructs to describe the inverse vulcanization process and discuss prepolymer approaches for the synthesis of segmented sulfur polyurethanes. Furthermore, this concept review discusses the advantages of inverse vulcanization in conjunction with dynamic covalent polymerization and post&#8208;polymerization modifications to prepare segmented block copolymers with enhanced thermomechanical and flame retardant properties of these materials.

         <title>Taming of Singlet Oxygen: Towards Artificial Oxygen Carriers Based on 1,4&#8208;Dialkylnaphthalenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cycloreversion reaction of a naphthalene endoperoxide with an attached DABCO moiety, yields exclusively triplet molecular oxygen. The reaction rate of the endoperoxides can be fine&#8208;tuned as needed, along with their solubility and targeting properties. Thus, a new pathway towards a new class of artificial oxygen carrier compounds presents itself.







Abstract
Naphthalene endoperoxides are known as convenient sources of singlet oxygen (O2, 1&#916;g), which is the major product of endoperoxide cycloreversion reaction. However, their potential as carriers of ground&#8208;state molecular oxygen (O2, 3&#931;g) similar to artificial oxygen carriers remains largely unexplored. This is due to the extreme reactivity and cytotoxic effects of the released singlet oxygen. We now report that a compound with a bimodular design, which incorporates an endoperoxide and an efficient physical quencher of singlet oxygen, 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), produces exclusively ground&#8208;state molecular oxygen. This result, coupled with the fact that oxygen release rates from endoperoxides are highly amenable to fine&#8208;tuning in a very broad range, and open to targeting by ligand attachment, raises the potential of these compounds far above any comparable chemical, or even biochemical sources. In cell culture experiments, we showed that the addition of the endoperoxide&#8208;quencher conjugate can enhance and sustain cell proliferation.

Photodetectors: By incorporating diamine into the 3D CsPbBr3 motif, the first quasi&#8208;2D trilayered CsPbBr3&#8208;based Dion&#8208;Jacobson hybrid perovskite (4&#8208;AMP)Cs2Pb3Br10 (1, where 4&#8208;AMP2+=4&#8208;(aminomethyl)piperidinium), is acquired. Photodetectors based on 1 exhibit excellent photoresponse, superior to its monolayered and bilayered counterparts. Our results may widen the range of the potential material of photodetection and will be helpful to design hybrid perovskites for other advanced optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (Q&#8208;2D) Dion&#8208;Jacobson (DJ) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites based on CsPbBr3 are promising candidates for photodetection. Previous studies have predicted that the photoresponse of such materials with high inorganic&#8208;layer numbers (n) will be more protruding in this portfolio. However, until now, only bilayered (n=2) CsPbBr3&#8208;based DJ&#8208;type hybrid perovskites are obtained and the higher number of layers (n&gt;2) remain completely unexplored, owing to the relatively high formation energies. Here, by incorporating diamine into the 3D CsPbBr3 motif, a new Q&#8208;2D trilayered CsPbBr3&#8208;based DJ&#8208;type hybrid perovskite that contains organic cation and inorganic Cs metal, namely (4&#8208;AMP)Cs2Pb3Br10 (1, 4&#8208;AMP2+=4&#8208;(aminomethyl)piperidinium, n=3), is obtained. Excitingly, 1 exhibits excellent photoresponse, superior to its single&#8208;layered and bilayered counterparts. The resulting photodetectors thus exhibit a large on/off ratio (&gt;103), high photodetectivity (6.5&#215;1010&#8197;Jones) and fast response speed (193&#8197;&#956;s). As far as we know, 1 is the first Q&#8208;2D CsPbBr3&#8208;based DJ&#8208;type hybrid perovskites with high n numbers. Our results may widen the range of the potential material in application of photodetection and will be helpful to design hybrid perovskites for other advanced optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Inactivation of Competitive Decay Channels Leads to Enhanced Coumarin Photochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To date, there is only little information on how to rationally optimize the uncaging efficiency of photocages. However, there are many studies that successfully optimized the performance of fluorophores. This study demonstrates that structural modifications inspired by the fluorophore ATTO 390 can lead to a one order of magnitude increase in the uncaging cross section of new coumarin photocages.







Abstract
In the development of photolabile protecting groups, it is of high interest to selectively modify photochemical properties with structural changes as simple as possible. In this work, knowledge of fluorophore optimization was adopted and used to design new coumarin&#8208; based photocages. Photolysis efficiency was selectively modulated by inactivating competitive decay channels, such as twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) or hydrogen&#8208;bonding, and the photolytic release of the neurotransmitter serotonin was demonstrated. Structural modifications inspired by the fluorophore ATTO 390 led to a significant increase in the uncaging cross section that can be further improved by the simple addition of a double bond. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy gave insights into the underlying solvent&#8208;dependent photophysical dynamics. The chromophores presented here are excellently suited as new photocages in the visible wavelength range due to their simple synthesis and their superior photochemical properties.

         <title>Isomorphic Fluorescent Nucleosides Facilitate Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of RNA Depurination by Ribosome Inactivating Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A real&#8208;time monitoring assay for RIP&#8208;mediated depurination: Ribosome&#8208;inactivating proteins (RIPs) interfere with protein synthesis by depurinating a specific adenosine residue within &#945;&#8208;sarcin/ricin loop. By strategically modifying a key position with responsive fluorescent nucleosides such as tzG, depurination by RIPs can be monitored in real time by fluorescence. The method provides insight into the RNA folding as well as RIPs&#8217; recognition features.







Abstract
Ribosome&#8208;inactivating proteins, a family of highly cytotoxic proteins, interfere with protein synthesis by depurinating a specific adenosine residue within the conserved &#945;&#8208;sarcin/ricin loop of eukaryotic ribosomal RNA. Besides being biological warfare agents, certain RIPs have been promoted as potential therapeutic tools. Monitoring their deglycosylation activity and their inhibition in real time have remained, however, elusive. Herein, we describe the enzymatic preparation and utility of consensus RIP hairpin substrates in which specific G residues, next to the depurination site, are surgically replaced with tzG and thG, fluorescent G analogs. By strategically modifying key positions with responsive fluorescent surrogate nucleotides, RIP&#8208;mediated depurination can be monitored in real time by steady&#8208;state fluorescence spectroscopy. Subtle differences observed in preferential depurination sites provide insight into the RNA folding as well as RIPs&#8217; substrate recognition features.

         <title>Photoactivatable V&#8208;Shaped Bifunctional Quinone Methide Precursors as a New Class of Selective G&#8208;quadruplex Alkylating Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
G4 ligand Quinone Methide precursors. A new family of G&#8208;quadruplex alkylating compounds able to generate quinone methides (QM) through photochemical activation has been designed and synthesized. In the presence of the human telomeric sequence, ammonium salt precursors showed the ability to generate mono&#8208; and crosslinking products identified both by gel and MALDI&#8208;ToF mass spectrometry analysis.







Abstract
Combining the selectivity of G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) ligands with the spatial and temporal control of photochemistry is an emerging strategy to elucidate the biological relevance of these structures. In this work, we developed six novel V&#8208;shaped G4 ligands that can, upon irradiation, form stable covalent adducts with G4 structures via the reactive intermediate, quinone methide (QM). We thoroughly investigated the photochemical properties of the ligands and their ability to generate QMs. Subsequently, we analyzed their specificity for various topologies of G4 and discovered a preferential binding towards the human telomeric sequence. Finally, we tested the ligand ability to act as photochemical alkylating agents, identifying the covalent adducts with G4 structures. This work introduces a novel molecular tool in the chemical biology toolkit for G4s.

         <title>Impact of N&#8208;Aryl&#8208; and NHC Core&#8208;Substituents on the Coupling of Alkylzinc Nucleophiles: Is Bigger always Better?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For almost two decades bulkier Pd&#8208;NHC catalysts, in particular those chlorinated on the NHC backbone, led to vastly improved reactivity in a wide cross&#8208;section of cross&#8208;coupling applications. In the case of alkyl&#8208;alkyl Negishi coupling, that this trend was found to be strikingly reversed. Moreover, bulkier catalysts always led to reduced BHE of secondary organozincs with aryl oxidative addition partners &#8211; another trend that is reversed.







Abstract
Bulky Pd&#8722;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysts (e.&#8201;g., N&#8208;(di&#8208;2,6&#8208;(3&#8208;pentyl)phenyl), IPent) have been shown to have significantly higher reactivity in a wide variety of cross&#8208;coupling applications (i.&#8201;e., C&#8722;C, C&#8722;S, C&#8722;N) than less hindered variants (e.&#8201;g., N&#8208;(di&#8208;2,6&#8208;(isopropyl)phenyl), IPr). Further, chlorinating the backbone of the NHC ring sees an even greater increase in reactivity. In the cross&#8208;coupling of (hetero)aryl electrophiles to secondary alkyl nucleophiles, making the N&#8208;aryl groups larger reduces the amount of &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination leading to alkene byproducts and chlorinating the NHC core had an even greater effect, all but eliminating alkene formation. In the present study involving the cross&#8208;coupling of primary alkyl electrophiles and nucleophiles, a sharp and surprising reversal of all of the above trends was observed. Bulkier catalysts had generally slower rate of reaction and &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination worsened leading to extensive amounts of alkene byproducts.

Several advances involving the identification of the actual active sites and intermediates capture on the catalytic surface were summarized, while the morphology and valence states change on 2D materials are specifically chose to illustrate how structural evolution affect catalytic activity.







Abstract
Water&#8208;splitting has emerged as a promising alternative strategy to produce clean hydrogen fuel. However, current electrocatalytic water splitting suffers from sluggish kinetics, thus developing efficient electrocatalysts is crucial. Identifying reaction centers discloses the reaction mechanism and will undoubtedly facilitate the design and optimization of efficient water splitting electrocatalysts. This review summarizes several advances involving the identification of the actual active sites and intermediates capture on the catalytic surface. The morphology and valence states change on 2D materials are chose to illustrate how structural evolution affect catalytic activity. Specifically, in&#8197;situ/ex situ electron microscopy techniques that used for the characterization of catalytic sites, and spectroscopy techniques that used to detect active intermediates at the molecular level are highlighted. In addition, several perspectives, such as the development of new in&#8197;situ techniques and electrokinetic analysis methods, are emphasized to shed light on future research.

         <title>How the Chalcogen Atom Size Dictates the Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Donor Capability of Carboxamides, Thioamides, and Selenoamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thioamides and selenoamides are better hydrogen&#8208;bond donors than carboxamides because their amino groups are more positively charged. Quantum chemical analyses reveal that this counterintuitive phenomenon, which cannot be explained by the electronegativity, originates from the larger electronic density flow from the nitrogen lone pair of the NH2 group towards the lower&#8208;lying &#960;* orbital on the C=S or C=Se bond. This difference can be traced back to the effective steric size of the chalcogen atoms. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Nieuwland and C. Fonseca&#8197;Guerra (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200755).

         <title>pH Switchable Water Dispersed Photocatalytic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photogeneration of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) can be controlled in space and in time by changing the irradiation intensity and focusing the activation light. Nevertheless, action of ROS is non&#8208;specific and the possibility of exploiting a local chemical signal as an additional control represents a great advancement. Tailored modification of the structure yields dual&#8208;stimuli responsive nanoparticles which are photo&#8208;active and kill cancer cells at acidic pH but not at neutral pH.







Abstract
Photogeneration of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) finds applications in fields as different as nanomedicine, art preservation, air and water depollution and surface decontamination. Here we present photocatalytic nanoparticles (NP) that are active only at acidic pH while they do not show relevant ROS photo&#8208;generation at neutral pH. This dual responsivity (to light and pH) is achieved by stabilizing the surface of TiO2 NP with a specific organic shell during the synthesis and it is peculiar of the achieved core shell&#8208;structure, as demonstrated by comparison with commercial photocatalytic TiO2 NP. For the investigation of the photocatalytic activity, we developed two methods that allow real time detection of the process preventing any kind of artifact arising from post&#8208;treatments and delayed analysis. The reversibility of the pH response was also demonstrated as well as the selective photo&#8208;killing of cancer cells at acidic pH.

         <title>Formal Umpolung Addition of Phosphites to 2&#8208;Azaaryl Ketones under Chiral Br&#248;nsted Base Catalysis: Enantioselective Protonation Utilizing [1,2]&#8208;Phospha&#8208;Brook Rearrangement</title>

         <dc:description>The formal enantioselective umpolung addition of dialkyl phosphites to 2&#8208;azaaryl ketones was developed under Br&#248;nsted base catalysis. The reaction involves the enantioselective protonation of the transient &#945;&#8208;oxygenated (2&#8208;azaaryl)methyl anion generated through the 1,2&#8208;addition of the anion of dialkyl phosphite to the 2&#8208;azaaryl ketone and the subsequent [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement. A chiral bis(guanidino)iminophosphorane organosuperbase efficiently catalyzed the reaction to provide enantio&#8208;enriched phosphates in high yields with good to high enantioselectivities. This is a rare example of the catalytic enantioselective protonation of transient carbanions other than enolates, constructing a trisubstituted stereogenic center &#945; to 2&#8208;azaarenes.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perfluoroalkylated (hetero)arenes represent an extremely important family of molecules commonly utilized in many areas such as medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry and material sciences. Due to their unique properties, they have attracted significant interest from synthetic chemists and various methods have been developed for their synthesis. Among them, the direct perfluoroalkylation of C(sp  2  )&#8208;H bonds in (hetero)arenes is one of the most attractive and straightforward ones, provided that it proceeds with high levels of regioselectivity. In this review article, a comprehensive overview of advances in this field is presented, with a special focus on the reaction mechanisms involved in these transformations and their regioselectivity. All methods available have been classified according to the nature of the perfluoroalkyl chain introduced, trifluoromethylation reactions being overviewed in a separate section, and to the nature of the reagents/catalysts required.</dc:description>

         <title>Sunlight&#8208;Induced In Situ Isomerization of Both Ligands in a Mixed&#8208;Ligand Coordination Polymer: From Photosalient to Photoinert Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Altering the reaction conditions from dark to visible light gives rise to the formation of two different 1D coordination polymers (CPs). Keeping the reaction mixture in dark results in the formation of interdigitated 1D CPs, which undergo photodimerization accompanied by a photosalient effect. On the other hand, while keeping the same reaction mixture under visible light, a different 1D CP is obtained via in&#8197;situ isomerization of both the ligands, which is found to be photoinert.







Abstract
Reaction of Zn(NO3)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O, maleic acid (H2mal) and trans&#8208;4&#8208;(1&#8208;naphthylvinyl)pyridine (trans&#8208;nvp) in the dark results in the formation of a one&#8208;dimensional coordination polymer (1D CP) [Zn(mal)(trans&#8208;nvp)] (1), which is photosalient in nature. The crystals of 1 pop violently under UV light and moderately in sunlight, and generate cyclobutane ligands. However, the same reaction mixture kept in visible light exhibits the rare example of in&#8197;situ isomerization of both ligands: cis&#8208;trans transformation of maleate and trans&#8208;cis isomerization of the nvp ligands, and subsequent formation of another 1D CP [Zn(fum)(cis&#8208;nvp)2(H2O)2] (2, H2fum=fumaric acid), which is found to be photoinert. Thus, altering the reaction condition from dark to visible light gives rise to photosalient to photoinert crystals.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent and Supramolecular Polymers: From Monolayer to Bilayer and the Thicker</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled growth of 2D polymer layers: With the synthetic strategies of monolayer 2D covalent and supramolecular polymers being available, synthetic chemistry for bilayer 2D polymers has emerged, which holds promises for attaining well&#8208;defined, few&#8208;layer 2D polymers. The advances will lead to a bridge to transform 2D materials to 3D materials in a controllable manner.







Abstract
Selective preparation of two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs) and supramolecular polymers (2DSPs) with defined thickness is crucially important for controlling and maximizing their functions, yet it has remained as a synthetic challenge. In the past decade, several approaches have been developed to allow selective preparation of discrete monolayer 2DPs and 2DSPs. Recently, crystal exfoliation and self&#8208;assembly strategies have been employed to successfully prepare bilayer 2DP and 2DSP, which represent the first step towards the controlled &#8220;growth&#8221; of 2D polymers from the thinnest monolayers to thicker few&#8208;layers along the third dimension. This Concept review discusses the concept of accurate synthesis of 2D polymers with defined layers. Advances in this research area will pave the way to rational synthetic strategies for 2D polymers with controlled thickness.

         <title>Chiral Hemilabile P,N&#8208;Ligand&#8208;Assisted Gold Redox Catalysis for Enantioselective Alkene Aminoarylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective, intermolecular alkene arylamination has been achieved through gold redox catalysis. Screening of ligands revealed chiral P,N ligands as the optimal choice, giving alkene aminoarylation with good yields (up to 80&#8201;%) and excellent stereoselectivity (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 er). As the first example of enantioselective gold redox catalysis, this work confirmed the feasibility of applying a chiral ligand at the gold(I) stage with the stereodetermining step (SDS) at the gold(III) intermediate, thus opening up a new way to conduct gold redox catalysis with stereochemistry control.

         <title>Lipid A Mimetics Based on Unnatural Disaccharide Scaffold as Potent TLR4 Agonists for Prospective Immunotherapeutics and Adjuvants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TLR4 activating lipid A mimetics with picomolar affinity were assembled on the basis of an unnatural synthetic &#946;,&#946;&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;linked diglucosamine scaffold. Excellent stereoselectivity in a challenging &#946;,&#946;&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;glycosylation was achieved by tuning the reactivities of donor and acceptor molecules using protective group manipulation strategy. Specific 3D&#8208;molecular shape of &#946;GlcN(1&#8596;1&#8242;)&#946;GlcN disaccharide was decisive for induction of pro&#8208;inflammatory signaling by disaccharide lipid A mimetics (&#946;&#946;&#8208;DLAMs) based thereof. Potent immunostimulating potential was confirmed in human and murine immune cells rendering &#946;&#946;&#8208;DLAMs promising vaccine adjuvant candidates.







Abstract
TLR4 is a key pattern recognition receptor that can sense pathogen&#8208; and danger&#8208; associated molecular patterns to activate the downstream signaling pathways which results in the upregulation of transcription factors and expression of interferons and cytokines to mediate protective pro&#8208;inflammatory responses involved in immune defense. Bacterial lipid A is the primary TLR4 ligand with very complex, species&#8208;specific, and barely predictable structure&#8208;activity relationships. Given that therapeutic targeting of TLR4 is an emerging tool for management of a variety of human diseases, the development of novel TLR4 activating biomolecules other than lipid A is of vast importance. We report on design, chemical synthesis and immunobiology of novel glycan&#8208;based lipid A&#8208;mimicking molecules that can activate human and murine TLR4&#8208;mediated signaling with picomolar affinity. Exploiting crystal structure &#8208; based design we have created novel disaccharide lipid A mimetics (DLAMs) where the inherently flexible &#946;(1&#8594;6)&#8208;linked diglucosamine backbone of lipid A is exchanged with a conformationally restrained non&#8208;reducing &#946;GlcN(1&#8596;1&#8242;)&#946;GlcN scaffold. Excellent stereoselectivity in a challenging &#946;,&#946;&#8208;1,1&#8242; glycosylation was achieved by tuning the reactivities of donor and acceptor molecules using protective group manipulation strategy. Divergent streamlined synthesis of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;linked diglucosamine&#8208;derived glycolipids entailing multiple long&#8208;chain (R)&#8208;3&#8208; acyloxyacyl residues and up two three phosphate groups was developed. Specific 3D&#8208;molecular shape and conformational rigidity of unnatural &#946;,&#946;&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;linked diglucosamine combined with carefully optimized phosphorylation and acylation pattern ensured efficient induction of the TLR4&#8208;mediated signaling in a species&#8208;independent manner.

         <dc:description>Triphenylphosphine photo&#8208;release from a sulfonamide azobenzene ruthenium&#8208;arene complex was exploited to activate Pd(II)Cl2  into Pd(0) catalyst, for the photo&#8208;initiation of Sonogashira cross&#8208;couplings. The transformation was initiated on demand &#8211; using simple white LED strip lights &#8211; with a high&#8208;temporal response and the ability to control reaction rate according to irradiation time.

         <dc:description>We report the first examples of metal&#8208;promoted double geminal activation of C(sp  3  )&#8211;H bonds of the N&#8211;CH  2  &#8211;N moiety in an imidazole&#8208;type heterocycle, leading to nickel and palladium NHC complexes under mild conditions.

Activation of the C&#8211;H bond of the resulting &#945;&#8208;methine C  sp3  H&#8211;M group occurred subsequently when  3  was reacted with HCl to yield the NHC pincer complex [PdCl(PC  NHC  P)]Cl (  2  ). The reaction of  1  with [NiBr  2  (dme)] also afforded a NHC pincer complex, [NiBr(PC  NHC  P)]Br (  6  ), but the reactions leading to the double geminal C&#8211;H bond activation of the N&#8211;CH  2  &#8211;N group were too fast to allow identification or isolation of an intermediate analogous to  3  .

         <dc:description>Novel donor&#8211;acceptor dyads containing [2.2]&#8208; and [3.3]paracyclophane (PCP) as the bridging moiety were synthesized and used to effectively fabricate dye&#8208;sensitized hydrogen production systems.

Although cyclic voltammetry measurements showed similar electron&#8208;donating properties among all the synthesized dyads, the lowest absorption energy of the [2.2]PCP moiety was lower than that of the [3.3]PCP one; this was due to its shorter distance between benzene rings, which could effectively drive the charge transfer between the donor and acceptor chromophores. Under visible light (&gt;395 nm), a dyad&#8208;loaded photocatalyst in a 0.5 M aqueous glycerol solution generated detectable hydrogen gases. The optimal turnover number and photocurrent order exhibited the same trend as the hydrogen production rate since the suggested number of excited photons played a critical role in hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;(tricyanoborane)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenate anion (  2  )&#160;was obtained in high yield by deprotonation of the B(CN)  3  &#8208;methylimidazole adduct&#160;  1  . Regarding charge and stereo&#8208;electronic properties, anion&#160;  2  &#160;closes the gap between well&#8208;known neutral NHCs and the ditopic dianionic NHC, the&#160;1,3&#8209;bis(tricyanoborane)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenate dianion (  IIb  ). The influence of the number of&#160;  N  &#8208;bonded tricyanoborane moieties on the &#963;&#8208;donating and &#960;&#8208;accepting properties of NHCs was assessed by quantum chemical calculations and verified by experimental data on&#160;  2  ,&#160;  IIb  , and 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#173;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;yilidene (IMe,&#160;  IIa  ). Therefore NHC&#160;  2  , which acts as a ditopic ligand via the carbene center and the cyano groups, was reacted with alkyl iodides, selenium, and [Ni(CO)  4  ] yielding alkylated imidazoles&#160;  3  &#160;and&#160;  4  , the anionic selenium adduct&#160;  5  , and the anionic nickel tricarbonyl complex&#160;  6  , respectively. The results of this study prove that charge, number of coordination sites, buried volume (%  V  bur  ) and &#963;&#8208;donor and &#960;&#8208;acceptor abilities of NHCs can be tuned effectively via the number of tricyanoborane substituents.</dc:description>

         <title>A shared prebiotic formation of neopterins and guanine nucleosides from pyrimidine bases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prebiotic origins of biopolymers and metabolic co&#8208;factors are key questions in Origins of Life studies. In a simple warm little pond model, utilizing a drying phase to produce a urea&#8208;enriched solution, we present a prebiotic synthetic path for the simultaneous formation of neopterins and tetrahydroneopterins, along with purine nucleosides. We show that the formation of neopterins from pyrimidine precursors, in the presence of ribose, and in a formylating environment consisting of a urea, ammonium formate, water (UAFW) is robust, while the simultaneous formation of guanosine requires a significantly higher ribose concentration. Furthermore, these reactions provide a redox pair of tetrahydropterin&#8208;pterin. This model suggests a prebiotic link in the origin of purine nucleosides and pterin cofactors, which provides a possible deep prebiotic temporal connection for the emergence of nucleic acids and metabolic cofactors</dc:description>

         <title>Dihydroxy&#8208;acid dehydratases from pathogenic bacteria: emerging drug targets to combat antibiotic resistance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is an urgent global need for the development of novel therapeutics to combat the rise of various antibiotic&#8208;resistant superbugs. Enzymes of the branched&#8208;chain amino acid (BCAA) biosynthesis pathway are an attractive target for novel anti&#8208;microbial drug development. Dihydroxy&#8208;acid dehydratase (DHAD) is the third enzyme in the BCAA biosynthesis pathway. It relies on an Fe&#8208;S cluster for catalytic activity and has recently also gained attention as a catalyst in cell&#8208;free enzyme cascades. Two types of Fe&#8208;S clusters have been identified in DHADs,  i.e.  [2Fe&#8208;2S] and [4Fe&#8208;4S], with the latter being more prone to degradation in the presence of oxygen. Here, we characterise two DHADs from bacterial human pathogens,  Staphylococcus aureus  and  Campylobacter jejuni  (  Sa  DHAD and  Cj  DHAD). Purified  Sa  DHAD and  Cj  DHAD are virtually inactive, but activity could be reversibly reconstituted  in vitro  (up to ~19,000&#8208;fold increase with  k  cat  as high as ~6.7 s  &#8208;1  ). Inductively&#8208;coupled plasma&#8208;optical emission spectroscopy (ICP&#8208;OES) measurements are consistent with the presence of [4Fe&#8208;4S] clusters in both enzymes. N&#8208;isopropyloxalyl hydroxamate (IpOHA) and aspterric acid are both potent inhibitors for both  Sa  DHAD (  K  i  = 7.8 and 51.6 &#181;M, respectively) and  Cj  DHAD (  K  i  = 32.9 and 35.1 &#181;M, respectively). These compounds thus present suitable starting points for the development of novel anti&#8208;microbial chemotherapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Deazaflavins Towards Highly Potent Reducing Photocatalysts Guided by Mechanistic Understanding &#8208; Enhancement of the Key Step by the Internal Heavy Atom Effect</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deazaflavins are well suited for reductive chemistry acting  via  a consecutive photo&#8208;induced electron transfer, in which their triplet state and semiquinone &#8208; the latter is formed from the former after electron transfer from a sacrificial electron donor &#8208; are key intermediates. Guided by mechanistic investigations aiming to increase intersystem crossing by the internal heavy atom effect and optimising the concentration conditions to avoid unproductive excited singlet reactions, we synthesised 5&#8208;aryldeazaflavins with Br or Cl substituents on different structural positions  via  a three&#8208;component reaction. Bromination of the deazaisoalloxazine core leads to almost 100% triplet yield but causes photo&#8208;instability and enhances unproductive side reactions. Bromine on the 5&#8208;phenyl group in ortho position does not affect the photostability, increases the triplet yield, and allows its efficient usage in the photocatalytic dehalogenation of bromo&#8208; and chloroarenes with electron&#8208;donating methoxy and alkyl groups even under aerobic conditions. Reductive powers comparable to lithium are achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur and azobenzenes, a profitable liaison: straightforward synthesis of photoswitchable thioglycosides with tunable properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azobenzene photoswitches are valuable tools for controlling properties of molecular systems with light. We have been investigating azobenzene glycoconjugates to probe carbohydrate&#8208;protein interactions and to design glycoazobenzene macrocycles with chiroptical and physicochemical properties modulated by light irradiation. To date, direct conjugation of glycosides to azobenzenes was performed by reactions providing target compounds in limited yields. We therefore sought a more effective and reliable coupling method. In this paper, we report on a straightforward thioarylation of azobenzene derivatives with glycosyl thiols as well as other thiols, thereby increasing the scope of azobenzene conjugation. Even challenging unsymmetrical conjugates can be achieved in good yields via sequential or one pot procedures. Importantly, red&#8208;shifted azoswitches, which are addressed with visible light were easily functionalized. Additionally, by oxidation of the sulfide bridge to the respective sulfones, both the photochromic and the thermal relaxation properties of the core azobenzene can be tuned. Utilizing this option, we realized orthogonal three&#8208;state photoswitching in mixtures containing two distinct azobenzene thioglycosides.</dc:description>

         <title>Triangular Arrangement of Ferromagnetic Iron Chains in the High&#8208;TC Ferromagnet TiFe1&#8722;xOs2+xB2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal borides (TMBs) containing B  n  &#8208;fragment (  n  &gt; 3) have recently gained interest for their ability to enable exciting magnetic materials. Herein, we show that the B  4  &#8208;containing TiFe  0.64(1)  Os  2.36(1)  B  2  is a new ferromagnetic TMB with a Curie temperature of 523(2) K and a Weiss constant of 554(3) K, originating from the chain of  M  3  &#8208;triangles (  M  = 64%Fe + 36%Os). The new phase was synthesized from the elements by arc&#8208;melting, and its structure was elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. It belongs to the Ti  1+  x  Os  2&#8722;  x  RuB  2  &#8208;type structure (space group  P  6&#773;2  m  , no. 189) and contains trigonal planar B  4  boron fragments [B&#9472;B distance of 1.87(4) &#197;] interacting with  M  3  &#8208;triangles [  M  &#9472;  M  distances of 2.637(8) &#197; and 3.0199(2) &#197;]. The experimental results were supported by computational calculations based on the ideal TiFeOs  2  B  2  composition, which revealed strong ferromagnetic interactions within and between the Fe  3  &#8208;triangles. This discovery represents the first magnetically ordered Os&#8208;rich TMB, thus it will help expand our knowledge of the role of Os in low&#8208;dimensional magnetism of intermetallics and enable the design of such materials in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>ThioCORMates: Tunable and Cost&#8208;Effective Carbon Monoxide&#8208;Releasing Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon monoxide&#8208;releasing molecules (CORMs), can offer a safer alternative to CO delivery than the use of CO gas cylinders. Upon treatment with an amine base,  S&#8208;aryl thioformates (&#8220;thioCORMates&#8221;) release CO nearly quantitatively at room temperature, a gas which can then be harnessed for carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling, biological study, or inorganic synthesis. These bench&#8208;stable molecules are easily synthesized from the corresponding thiophenol and can be electronically tuned to release CO at different rates&#8212;from less than 1 minute to greater than 1 hour&#8212;offering a practical alternative to existing CORM technology. Finally, isotopically labeled  13CO can be conveniently generated and used, with the thioCORMate synthesized from  13C&#8208;formic acid.</dc:description>

         <title>Cucurbit[7]uril Inhibits IAPP Aggregation by Targeting N&#8208;terminus Hot Segments and Attenuates Cytotoxicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two &#8220;hot segments&#8221; within islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) are responsible for its self&#8208;assembly, which in turn is linked to the decline of &#946;&#8208;cells in type II diabetes (T2D). A readily available water&#8208;soluble, macrocyclic host, cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), effectively inhibits IAPP aggregation by ion&#8208;dipole and hydrophobic interactions with different residues of the monomeric peptide in its random coil conformation. HSQC NMR study shows that CB[7] modulates IAPP self&#8208;assembly likely by interacting with and masking major residues present in the &#8220;hot segments&#8221; at the N&#8208;terminus. CB[7] also prevents formation of toxic oligomers and inhibits seed&#8208;catalyzed fibril proliferation. Importantly, CB[7] recovers rat insulinoma cells (RIN&#8208;m) from IAPP&#8208;assembly associated cytotoxicity.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Installation of Dehydroamino Acid Motifs into Peptides Enabled by an N&#8208;Chloropeptide Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional methods for the construction of dehydroamino acids (&#916;AAs), which are a unique class of non&#8208;proteiogenic amino acids, require the pre&#8208;installation of special amino acids. Herein, we report and demonstrate the practical utility of an N &#8208;chloropeptide strategy for the rapid construction of &#916;AA&#8208;containing peptides. The electrophilic N &#8208;chlorination of peptide bonds is drastically accelerated by a catalytic amount of quinuclidine (ABCO), and the subsequent &#946;&#8208;elimination of N &#8208;chloroamide efficiently provides &#916;AA&#8208;containing peptides in high yield. The strategy enables, for the first time, the construction of a wide variety of &#916;AA residues in peptides without any pre&#8208;functionalized side chains and facilitates the late&#8208;stage installation of &#916;AA motifs into already&#8208;constructed oligopeptides, including a medicinally important macrocyclic peptide.</dc:description>

         <title>Cesium Fluoride Promoted Synthesis of Stable Organocesium Reagents and Their Ambident Reactivities with Arynes.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Described are the diverse reactivities of novel, stable, ambident thio&#8208;organocesium reagents (bearing electron withdrawing groups) against benzynes. Reactions at reflux temperature predominantly led to the generation of various functionalized stable sulfonium ylides and at 45 &#176;C the same reaction underwent direct c&#8208;arylation. Furthermore, Lack of internal hydrogen on cesium reagent helped to produce different ortho&#8208;bifunctional arynes in both the reactions. Interestingly, depending on the reactivities of substrates, the one&#8208;pot tri&#8208;component procedure generated either ylides or &#963;&#8208;bond insertion product.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A palladium&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation of substituted benzoic acids with maleimides leading to tricyclic heterocyclic molecules having a free carboxylic group in a high atom and step&#8208;economical manner is reported. The reaction proceeds via a dual C&#8208;H bond activation such as C(sp  3  )&#8208;H at the benzylic position and C(sp  2  )&#8208;H bond activation at the meta position of aromatics. An external ligand (MPAA) is crucial for the success of this annulation protocol. Further, the decarboxylation and esterification of the free carboxylic acid group of annulation products were carried out.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The utility of 2&#8208;diphenylphosphoryloxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes for the construction of substituted six&#8208;membered nitrogen heterocycles is presented. These dienes undergo boron trifluoride&#8208;promoted aza&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions when reacted with imines or related species formed in situ using aldehydes and amine derivatives. The stability of the dienes allows this three&#8208;component reaction to be carried out with no special precautions to eliminate water or air. Thirty&#8208;one examples of this process are presented. The usefulness of the enol phosphate functional group is highlighted in further reactions after the cycloaddition step to generate functionalized piperidenes or pyridines.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Bridging Enables Isolated Iron Atoms on Stereoassembled Carbon Framework To Boost Oxygen Reduction for Zinc&#8208;air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Realizing the synergy between active site regulation and rational structural engineering is essential in the electrocatalysis community but still challenging. Here, we demonstrate a matrix&#8208;confined co&#8208;pyrolysis strategy based on molecular bridging to realize highly dispersed Fe atoms on stereoassembled carbon framework. Both polyacrylonitrile matrix and organic linker from metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide sufficient N&#8208;anchoring sites for the generation of Fe&#8208;N  4  moieties. A high Fe loading of 2.9 wt.% is readily achieved based on the scalable approach without post&#8208;treatment. Owing to the presence of highly exposed Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C sites and well&#8208;tuned pore structures, isolated Fe atoms on porous carbon nanofiber framework (Fe&#8208;SA/NCF) exhibits decent oxygen reduction activity and stability in alkaline conditions via a near four&#8208;electron path, demonstrating superior performance as air cathode for zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) to commercial Pt/C catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogenative catalysis with three&#8208;coordinate zinc complexes supported with PN ligands is enhanced compared to PNP analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work details the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic activity of reactive low&#8208;coordinate organozinc complexes. The complexes activate hydrogen and they appear to be more active in hydrogenation of ketones and imines than their tridentate pincer analogs. This is thought, in part, to be due to the lack of trailing third phosphorus arm present in previous work. DFT computations reveal a sigma&#8208;bond metathesis mechanism is comparable to an alternative aromatization/dearomatization metal&#8208;ligand cooperative mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>The Pursuit of Perphenylterphenyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetradecaphenyl&#8208;  p  &#8208;terphenyl (  2  ) was synthesized from 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diiodobenzene (  11  ) by two methods. Ullmann coupling of  11  with pentaphenyliodobenzene (  9  ) gave compound  2  in 1.7% yield, and Sonogashira coupling of  11  with phenylacetylene, followed by a double Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of the product diyne  12  with tetracyclone (  6  ), gave  2  in 1.5% overall yield. The latter reaction also gave the monoaddition product 4&#8208;(phenylethynyl)&#8208;2,2',3,3',4',5,5',6,6'&#8208;nonaphenylbiphenyl (  13  ) in 4% overall yield. The X&#8208;ray structures of compounds  2  and  13  show them to possess core aromatic rings distorted into shallow boat conformations. Density functional calculations indicate that these unusual structures are not the lowest energy conformations in the gas phase, and may be the result of packing forces in the crystal. In addition, while uncorrected DFT calculations indicate that the strain energy in compound  2  is approximately 50 kcal/mol, dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT calculations suggest that it is essentially unstrained, due to compensating, favorable, intramolecular interactions of its many phenyl rings. An attempted synthesis of tetradecaphenyl&#8208;  o  &#8208;terphenyl (  4  ) by reaction of diphenylhexatriyne (  14  ) with three equivalents of tetracyclone at 350 &#176;C gave only the diadduct 2&#8208;(phenylethynyl)&#8208;2',3,3',4,4',5,5',6,6'&#8208;nonaphenylbiphenyl (  15  ) in 17% yield. Even higher temperatures failed to produce  4  and lowered the yield of  15  , perhaps due to rapid decomposition of the starting materials. Ullmann coupling of 3,4,5,6&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;diiodobenzene (  16  ) and compound  9  also failed to give compound  4  .</dc:description>

         <title>Adaptable optical microwaveguides from mechanically flexible crystalline materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible organic crystals (elastic and plastic) are important materials for optical waveguides, tunable optoelectronic devices, and photonic integrated circuits. Here, we present highly elastic organic crystals of a Schiff base, 1&#8208;((E)&#8208;(2,5&#8208;dichlorophenylimino)methyl)naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol (  1  ) and an azine molecule, 2,4&#8208;dibromo&#8208;6&#8208;((E)&#8208;((E)&#8208;(2,6&#8208;dichlorobenzylidene)hydrazono)methyl)phenol (  2  ). These microcrystals are highly flexible under external mechanical force, both in the macroscopic and the microscopic regimes. The mechanical flexibility of these crystals arises as a result of weak and dispersive C&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Cl, Cl&#183;&#183;&#183;Cl, Br&#183;&#183;&#183;Br, and &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; stacking interactions. Singly and doubly&#8208;bent geometries were achieved from their straight shape by a micromechanical approach using the AFM cantilever tip. Crystals of molecules  1  and  2  display a bright&#8208;green and red fluorescence (FL) emission, respectively, and selective reabsorption of a part of their FL band. Crystals  1  and  2  exhibit optical&#8208;path&#8208;dependent low loss emissions at the termini of crystal in their straight and even in extremely bent geometries. Interestingly, the excitation position&#8208;dependent optical modes appear in both linear and bent waveguides of crystals  1  and  2  , confirming their light&#8208;trapping ability.</dc:description>

         <title>Mapping Catalyst&#8208;Solvent Interplay in Competing Carboamination/Cyclopropanation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Group 9 metals, in particular Rh  III  complexes with cyclopentadienyl ligands, are competent C&#8211;H activation catalysts. Recently, a Cp*Rh  III  catalyzed reaction of alkenes with  N  &#8208;enoxyphthalimides showed divergent outcome based on the solvent, with carboamination favored in methanol and cyclopropanation in 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol (TFE). Here, we create selectivity and activity maps capable of unravelling the catalyst&#8208;solvent interplay on the outcome of these competing reactions by analyzing 42 cyclopentadienyl metal catalysts, Cp  X  M  III  (M = Co, Rh, Ir). These maps not only can be used to rationalize previously reported experimental results, but also capably predict the behavior of untested catalyst/solvent combinations as well as aid in identifying experimental protocols that simultaneously optimize both catalytic activity and selectivity (solutions in the Pareto front). In this regard, we demonstrate how and why the experimentally employed Cp*Rh  III  catalyst represents an ideal choice to invoke a solvent&#8208;induced change in reactivity. Additionally, the maps reveal the degree to which even perceived minor changes in the solvent (  e.g.  , replacing methanol with ethanol) influence the ratio of carboamination and cyclopropanation products. Overall, the selectivity and activity maps presented here provide a generalizable tool to create global pictures of anticipated reaction outcome that can be used to develop new experimental protocols spanning metal, ligand, and solvent space.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Metal Halides: An Emerging Class of Stimuli Responsive Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luminescent organic&#8208;inorganic metal halides (OIMHs) are well known as a new materials family in recent years. Novel materials and applications of luminescent OIMHs have been explored by changing either the organic component or the metal halide species. Thereinto, the stimuli&#8208;responsive (SR) phenomena in OIMHs have drawn much attention recently, for not only their attractive application potential but also the helpfulness in understanding the stability of OIMHs to the external environment. Herein, the luminescent OIMHs that are sensitive to external stimuli including contact, pressure, mechanical grinding, light, heat, and gas molecules, are reviewed, with an emphasis on analyses of the structural change during the SR process. The applications of SR luminescent OIMHs in widespread fields, including gas sensing, information encryption, and rewritable luminescent paper are summarized. Finally, the challenges that deserve to be further explored in this research field are discussed, which provides certain guidance for the future study of SR luminescent OIMHs.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent progress of small&#8208;molecule ratiometric fluorescent probes for peroxynitrite in biological systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8208;) as a major reactive oxygen species plays important roles in cellular signal transduction and homeostatic regulation. Precise detection of ONOO&#8208; in biological systems is vital for exploring its physiological and pathological function. Among numerous detection methods, fluorescence imaging technology using fluorescent probe offers some advantages, including simple operation, high sensitivity and selectivity, real&#8208;time and non&#8208;destructive detection. In particular, ratiometric fluorescent probes, in which the built&#8208;in calibration of the two emission bands prevents interference from the biological environment, have been extensively employed to monitor the fluctuation of bioactive species. In this review, we will discuss the small&#8208;molecule ratiometric fluorescent probes for ONOO&#8208; in live cells or in vivo, which involves the chemical structures, response mechanism and biological applications. Moreover, the challenges and future prospects of ONOO&#8208; responsive ratiometric fluorescent probe are also proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>HPLC&#8208;Based Automated Synthesis of Glycans in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As the 21  st  century unfolds with rapid changes, new challenges in research and development emerge. These new challenges prompted us to repurpose our HPLC&#8208;A platform that was previously used in solid phase glycan synthesis to a solution phase batch synthesis described herein. The modular character of HPLC allows for implementing new attachments. To enable sequential synthesis of multiple oligosaccharides with the single press of a button, we supplemented our system with a four&#8208;way split valve and an automated fraction collector. This enabled the operator to load all reagents and all reactants in the autosampler, press the button to start the repetitive automation sequence, leave the lab, and upon return find products of multiple reactions ready for purification, analysis, and subsequent application</dc:description>

         <title>Modulated Synthesis of Self&#8208;Standing Covalent Organic Framework Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The weak interaction of covalent organic framework (COF) nanoparticles makes the preparation of self&#8208;standing COF &#64257;lms difficult. Herein, we report a modulated strategy for the facile synthesis of self&#8208;standing COF films with good crystallinity and tunable thickness. As compared with the non&#8208;modulated approach, the modulated strategy changes the COF morphology from nanoparticles to nanofibers, enabling the facile preparation of self&#8208;standing COF films with improved mechanical properties. The Young's modulus of the self&#8208;standing COF film obtained via the modulated strategy could increase by 26 times. Moreover, self&#8208;standing LZU&#8208;8 film can be used as a membrane for efficient removal of 99% mercury ions from aqueous solution. Our results open up a new approach to prepare self&#8208;standing COF thin &#64257;lms for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Driving the active site incorporation in zeolitic materials via the organic structure&#8208;directing agent through development of H&#8208;bonds with hydroxyl groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work we use (1  S  ,2  S  )&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;pseudoephedrine (MPS) as organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA) for the synthesis of Mg&#8208;doped nanoporous aluminophosphates. This molecule displays a particular conformational behavior, where the presence of H&#8208;bond donor and acceptor groups provide a rigid conformational space with one asymmetric conformation preferentially occurring. MPS drives the crystallization of Mg&#8208;containing AFI materials. Characterization of these materials shows that the OSDA incorporate as protonated species, arranged as head&#8208;to&#8208;tail monomers. Combination of three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction with high&#8208;resolution synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction allowed to locate both the Mg and the organic species. Interestingly, results showed that the spatial incorporation of Mg is driven by the hydroxyl groups of the organic cation through the development of H&#8208;bonds with negatively&#8208;charged MgO  4  tetrahedra. Thus, our work demonstrates that H&#8208;bond forming groups can be used to drive the spatial incorporation of low&#8208;valent dopants within zeolitic frameworks, a highly desired aim in order to control their catalytic activity and selectivity.</dc:description>
