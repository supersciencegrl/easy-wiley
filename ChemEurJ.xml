         <title>Bis(pertrifluoromethylcatecholato)silane: Extreme Lewis Acidity Broadens the Catalytic Portfolio of Silicon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given its earth abundance, silicon is ideal for constructing Lewis acids of use in catalysis or materials science. Neutral silanes were limited to moderate Lewis acidity, until halogenated catecholato ligands provoked a significant boost. However, catalytic applications of bis(perhalocatecholato)silanes were suffering from very poor solubility and unknown deactivation pathways. Herewith, the novel per(trifluoromethyl)catechol, H2cat  CF3  , and adducts of its silicon complex Si(catCF3  )2  (1) are described. According to the computed fluoride ion affinity, 1 ranks among the strongest neutral Lewis acids currently accessible in the condensed phase. The improved robustness and affinity of 1 enable deoxygenations of aldehydes, ketones, amides, or phosphine oxides, and a carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis. All those transformations have never been catalyzed by a neutral silane. Attempts to obtain donor&#8208;free 1 attest to the extreme Lewis acidity by stabilizing adducts with even the weakest donors, such as benzophenone or hexaethyl disiloxane.</dc:description>

         <title>Multivalent Tryptophan&#8208; and Tyrosine&#8208;Containing [60]Fullerene Hexa&#8208;Adducts as Dual HIV and Enterovirus A71 Entry Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unprecedented 3D hexa&#8208;adducts of [60]fullerene peripherally decorated with twelve tryptophan (Trp) or tyrosine (Tyr) residues have been synthesized. Studies on the antiviral activity of these novel compounds against HIV and EV71 reveal that they are much more potent against HIV and equally active against EV71 than the previously described dendrimer prototypes AL&#8208;385 and AL&#8208;463 , which possess the same number of Trp/Tyr residues on the periphery but attached to a smaller and more flexible pentaerythritol core. These results demonstrate the relevance of the globular 3D presentation of the peripheral groups (Trp/Tyr) as well as the length of the spacer connecting them to the central core to interact with the viral envelopes, particularly in the case of HIV, and support the hypothesis that [60]fullerene can be an alternative and attractive biocompatible carbon&#8208;based scaffold for this type of highly symmetrical dendrimers. In addition, the functionalized fullerenes here described, which display twelve peripheral negatively charged indole moieties on their globular surface, define a new and versatile class of compounds with a promising potential in biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Near&#8208;Infrared Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Chiral YbIII&#8208;Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox&#8208;active chiral near&#8208;infrared circularly polarized luminescent field&#8208;induced single&#8208;molecule magnet of YbIII at the solid&#8208;state was designed from the bridging of two Yb(facam)3 units with the bis(1,10&#8208;phenantro[5,6b])tetrathiafulvalene triad.







Abstract
A field&#8208;induced chiral YbIII Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) displayed an unprecedented near&#8208;infrared circularly polarized luminescence (NIR&#8208;CPL) in the solid&#8208;state. The bridging bis(1,10&#8208;phenantro[5,6b])tetrathiafulvalene triad (L) allowed an efficient sensitization of the NIR 2F5/2&#8594;2F7/2 emission while the NIR&#8208;CPL is associated to the f&#8208;f transitions of the YbIII ion bearing chiral &#946;&#8208;diketonate derived&#8208;camphorate ancillary ligands.

         <title>Synthesis of Uniform Gold Nanorods with Large Width to Realize Ultralow SERS Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality gold nanorods (Au NRs) with width ranging from 6.5&#8197;nm to 175&#8197;nm were successfully synthesized by introducing heptanol molecules during cetyltrimethylammonium bromide&#8208;templated, seeded growth method. The array of vertically aligned Au NRs as SERS substrates can achieve the ultralow limit of detection (LOD) (10&#8722;16&#8197;M for CV probes) with good reliability and reproducibility. Thanks to their LOD, they can be used for rapid detection and identification of residual harmful substances with an ultralow concentration.







Abstract
In this work, we successfully demonstrate high&#8208;yield synthesis of high&#8208;quality gold nanorods (Au NRs) with width ranging from 6.5&#8197;nm to 175&#8197;nm by introducing heptanol molecules as secondary templating agents during cetyltrimethylammonium bromide&#8208;templated, seeded growth method. The results show that an appropriate concentration of heptanol molecules not only alter the micellization behavior of CTAB in water, but also help silver ions impact the symmetry&#8208;breaking efficiency of additional Au&#8722;NP seeds in addition to enhancing the utilization of gold precursors. Moreover, the generality and versatility of the present strategy for synthesis of Au NRs with flexible controlled dimensions are further demonstrated by successful synthesis of Au NRs with the assistance of other fatty alcohols with properly long alkyl chains. Furthermore, when arrays of vertically aligned Au NRs with large width (AVA&#8722;Au120&#215;90 NRs) are used as SERS substrates, they can achieve the ultralow limit of detection for crystal violet (10&#8722;16&#8197;M) with good reliability and reproducibility, and the rapid detection and identification of residual harmful substances.

         <title>Non&#8208;coordinated and Hydrogen Bonded Phenolate Anions as One&#8208;Electron Reducing Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 21, Page 6465-6478, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effect of hydrogen bonding on redox properties: The deprotonation of phenol derivatives with a tetraphosphazene base delivers non&#8208;coordinated phenolates with zinc&#8208;like redox potentials of up to &#8722;0.72(1)&#8197;V vs. SCE, which are capable in radical anion synthesis and SF6 activation. The addition of phenol or water allows for the selective formation of phenolate adducts and enables the study of the effect of hydrogen bonding on phenolate redox properties.







Abstract
In this work, the syntheses of non&#8208;coordinated electron&#8208;rich phenolate anions via deprotonation of the corresponding alcohols with an extremely powerful perethyl tetraphosphazene base (Schwesinger base) are reported. The application of uncharged phosphazenes renders the selective preparation of anionic phenol&#8208;phenolate and phenolate hydrates possible, which allows for the investigation of hydrogen bonding in these species. Hydrogen bonding brings about decreased redox potentials relative to the corresponding non&#8208;coordinated phenolate anions. The latter show redox potentials of up to &#8722;0.72(1)&#8197;V vs. SCE, which is comparable to that of zinc metal, thus qualifying their application as organic zinc mimics. We utilized phenolates as reducing agents for the generation of radical anions in addition to the corresponding phenoxyl radicals. A tetracyanoethylene radical anion salt was synthesized and fully characterized as a representative example. We also present the activation of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) with phenolates in a SET reaction, in which the nature of the respective phenolate determines whether simple fluorides or pentafluorosulfanide ([SF5]&#8722;) salts are formed.

&lt;p&gt;In this work, the syntheses of non&#8208;coordinated electron&#8208;rich phenolate anions via deprotonation of the corresponding alcohols with an extremely powerful perethyl tetraphosphazene base (Schwesinger base) are reported. The application of uncharged phosphazenes renders the selective preparation of anionic phenol&#8208;phenolate and phenolate hydrates possible, which allows for the investigation of hydrogen bonding in these species. Hydrogen bonding brings about decreased redox potentials relative to the corresponding non&#8208;coordinated phenolate anions. The latter show redox potentials of up to &#8722;0.72(1)&#8197;V vs. SCE, which is comparable to that of zinc metal, thus qualifying their application as organic zinc mimics. We utilized phenolates as reducing agents for the generation of radical anions in addition to the corresponding phenoxyl radicals. A tetracyanoethylene radical anion salt was synthesized and fully characterized as a representative example. We also present the activation of sulfur hexafluoride (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) with phenolates in a SET reaction, in which the nature of the respective phenolate determines whether simple fluorides or pentafluorosulfanide ([SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) salts are formed.&lt;/p&gt;

Crystallize this: In&#8197;situ synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction is employed to investigate the crystallisation of perfluorinated CeIV&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks with UiO&#8208;66 and MIL&#8208;140 topology in aqueous environment. The effects of reaction temperature, HNO3 as protonation modulator and CH3COOH as coordination modulator on the kinetics and thermodynamics of the process are evaluated.







Abstract
We report on the results of an in&#8197;situ synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction study of the crystallisation in aqueous medium of two recently discovered perfluorinated CeIV&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), analogues of the already well investigated ZrIV&#8208;based UiO&#8208;66 and MIL&#8208;140A, namely, F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce) and F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce). The two MOFs were originally obtained in pure form in similar conditions, using ammonium cerium nitrate and tetrafluoroterephthalic acid as reagents, and small variations of the reaction parameters were found to yield mixed phases. Here, we investigate the crystallisation of these compounds, varying parameters such as temperature, amount of the protonation modulator nitric acid and amount of the coordination modulator acetic acid. When only HNO3 is present in the reaction environment, only F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce) is obtained. Heating preferentially accelerates nucleation, which becomes rate determining below 57&#8201;&#176;C. Upon addition of AcOH to the system, alongside HNO3, mixed&#8208;phased products are obtained. F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce) is always formed faster, and no interconversion between the two phases occurs. In the case of F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce), crystal growth is always the rate&#8208;determining step. A higher amount of HNO3 favours the formation of F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce), whereas increasing the amount of AcOH favours the formation of F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce). Based on the in&#8197;situ results, a new optimised route to achieving a pure, high&#8208;quality F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce) phase in mild conditions (60&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8197;h) is also identified.

         <title>Directed Design of a AuI Complex with a Reduced Mesoionic Carbene Radical Ligand: Insights from 1,2,3&#8208;Triazolylidene Selenium Adducts and Extensive Electrochemical Investigations</title>

MIC drop! The first example and the spectroscopic characterization of a metal&#8208;bound as well as selenium&#8208;bound mesoionic carbene (MIC)&#8208;radical of the 1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene type is reported. Design principles for stabilizing such radicals are presented as well.







Abstract
Carbene&#8208;based radicals are important for both fundamental and applied chemical research. Herein, extensive electrochemical investigations of nine different 1,2,3&#8208;triazolylidene selenium adducts are reported. It is found that the half&#8208;wave potentials of the first reduction of the selones correlate with their calculated LUMO levels and the LUMO levels of the corresponding triazolylidene&#8208;based mesoionic carbenes (MICs). Furthermore, unexpected quasi&#8208;reversibility of the reduction of two triazoline selones, exhibiting comparable reduction potentials, was discovered. Through UV/Vis/NIR and EPR spectroelectrochemical investigations supported by DFT calculations, the radical anion was unambiguously assigned to be triazoline centered. This electrochemical behavior was transferred to a triazolylidene&#8208;type MIC&#8208;gold phenyl complex resulting in a MIC&#8208;radical coordinated AuI species. Apart from UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR and EPR spectroelectrochemical investigations of the reduction, the reduced gold&#8208;coordinated MIC radical complex was also formed in situ in the bulk through chemical reduction. This is the first report of a monodentate triazolylidene&#8208;based MIC ligand that can be reduced to its anion radical in a metal complex. The results presented here provide design principles for stabilizing radicals based on MICs.

Laser damage limitation: Promising ternary infrared nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, Na6MQ4 (M=Zn, Cd; Q=S, Se), with unique [NaQ4] NLO&#8208;active groups, are successfully prepared. Theoretical calculations and statistical analyses indicate that the second&#8208;harmonic generation effect and band gap in the compounds originate mainly from the distorted NaQ4 NLO&#8208;active units with a short Na&#8722;S bond length.







Abstract
Four sodium&#8208;based ternary IR nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, Na6MQ4 (M=Zn, Cd; Q=S, Se), were prepared through a high&#8208;temperature flux method. The crystal structure of the compounds is built up of isolated [MQ4] tetrahedra and a 3D framework formed by the NaQn (n=4, 5) units. The two selenides, Na6MSe4 (M=Zn, Cd), as promising IR NLO materials, show moderate second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) responses (0.9 and 0.5&#215;AgGaS2) with good phase&#8208;matching behavior, as well as high laser damage thresholds (2 and 1.9&#215;AgGaS2). The two sulfides, Na6MS4 (M=Zn, Cd), exhibit higher laser damage thresholds (13 and 4&#215;AgGaS2), but smaller SHG responses (0.3 and 0.2&#215;AgGaS2). Theoretical calculations and statistical analyses indicate that the SHG effect and band gap in the compounds originate mainly from the distorted NaQ4 NLO&#8208;active units with a short Na&#8722;S bond length, which provides a new insight into the design of novel IR NLO materials.

         <title>Dipyrrinato&#8208;Iridium(III) Complexes for Application in Photodynamic Therapy and Antimicrobial Photodynamic Inactivation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 21, Page 6440-6459, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heteroleptic dipyrrinato iridium complexes were synthesized and evaluated for their phototoxic activity against tumor cells and bacteria, the Gram&#8208;positive germ S. aureus and the Gram&#8208;negative Germ P. aeruginosa. Specifically, glycosylated phenylpyridyl&#8208;dipyrrinato complexes showed a high phototoxic effect against cells and S. aureus. Certain cyclopentadienyl&#8208;dipyrrinato complexes exerted a high phototoxic effect on S. aureus and P. aeruginosa.







Abstract
The generation of bio&#8208;targetable photosensitizers is of utmost importance to the emerging field of photodynamic therapy and antimicrobial (photo&#8208;)therapy. A synthetic strategy is presented in which chelating dipyrrin moieties are used to enhance the known photoactivity of iridium(III) metal complexes. Formed complexes can thus be functionalized in a facile manner with a range of targeting groups at their chemically active reaction sites. Dipyrrins with N&#8208; and O&#8208;substituents afforded (dipy)iridium(III) complexes via complexation with the respective Cp*&#8208;iridium(III) and ppy&#8208;iridium(III) precursors (dipy=dipyrrinato, Cp*=pentamethyl&#8208;&#951;5&#8208;cyclopentadienyl, ppy=2&#8208;phenylpyridyl). Similarly, electron&#8208;deficient [IrIII(dipy)(ppy)2] complexes could be used for post&#8208;functionalization, forming alkenyl, alkynyl and glyco&#8208;appended iridium(III) complexes. The phototoxic activity of these complexes has been assessed in cellular and bacterial assays with and without light; the [IrIII(Cl)(Cp*)(dipy)] complexes and the glyco&#8208;substituted iridium(III) complexes showing particular promise as photomedicine candidates. Representative crystal structures of the complexes are also presented.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Heteroleptic dipyrrinato&lt;/b&gt; iridium complexes were synthesized and evaluated for their phototoxic activity against tumor cells and bacteria, the Gram&#8208;positive germ &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; and the Gram&#8208;negative Germ &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;. Specifically, glycosylated phenylpyridyl&#8208;dipyrrinato complexes showed a high phototoxic effect against cells and &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt;. Certain cyclopentadienyl&#8208;dipyrrinato complexes exerted a high phototoxic effect on &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;.

Dope or coat? Luminescent materials doped with Ln3+ ions attract much attention for their application as optical thermometers based on both downshifting and upconversion processes. Herein, highly sensitive optical thermometers based on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films doped with two series of visible Ln3+ complexes and SiO2 nanoparticles coated with these PMMA films are investigated for the physiological temperature range.







Abstract
In recent years, luminescent materials doped with Ln3+ ions have attracted much attention for their application as optical thermometers based on both downshifting and upconversion processes. This study presents research done on the development of highly sensitive optical thermometers in the physiological temperature range based on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films doped with two series of visible Ln3+ complexes (Ln3+=Tb3+, Eu3+, and Sm3+) and SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) coated with these PMMA films. The best performing PMMA film doped with Tb3+ and Eu3+ complexes was the PMMA[TbEuL1tppo]1 film (L1=4,4,4&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadionate; tppo=triphenylphosphine oxide), which showed good temperature sensing of Sr=4.21&#8201;%&#8201;K&#8722;1 at 313&#8197;K, whereas for the PMMA films doped with Tb3+ and Sm3+ complexes the best performing was the PMMA[TbSmL2tppo]3 film (L2=4,4,4&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;1&#8208;(4&#8208;chlorophenyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadionate), with Sr=3.64&#8201;%&#8201;K&#8722;1 at 313&#8197;K. Additionally, SiO2 NPs coated with the best performing films from each of the series of PMMA films (Tb&#8211;Eu and Tb&#8211;Sm) and their temperature&#8208;sensing properties were studied in water, showing excellent performance in the physiological temperature range (PMMA[TbEuL1tppo]1@SiO2: Sr=3.84&#8201;%&#8201;&#176;C at 20&#8201;&#176;C; PMMA[TbSmL2tppo]3@SiO2: Sr=3.27&#8201;%&#8201;&#176;C at 20&#8201;&#176;C) and the toxicity of these nanoparticles on human cells was studied, showing that they were nontoxic.

Tri&#8208; and difluoromethylation/cyclization/indole oxidative cleavage: An unprecedented electrochemical tri&#8208; and difluoromethylation/cyclization/indole oxidative cleavage process has been established in an undivided cell. The protocol employs a readily prepared Langlois reagent as the fluoroalkyl source, affording a series of tri&#8208; or difluoromethylated 2&#8208;(2&#8208;acetylphenyl)isoquinoline&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones in good yields with excellent stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Considering their unique roles in organic synthesis, and pharmaceutical and agrochemical applications, the development of fluoroalkylation, cyclization, and indole oxidative cleavage are important topics. Herein, an unprecedented electrochemical tri&#8208; and difluoromethylation/cyclization/indole oxidative cleavage process occurring in an undivided cell is presented. The protocol employs a readily prepared Langlois reagent as the fluoroalkyl source, affording a series of tri&#8208; or difluoromethylated 2&#8208;(2&#8208;acetylphenyl)isoquinoline&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones in good yields with excellent stereoselectivity. It is worth noting that this new methodology merges the fluoroalkylation/cyclization of N&#8208;substituted acrylamide alkenes with the oxidative cleavage of an indole C(2)=C(3) bond under external oxidant&#8208;free conditions.

Magnesium and p&#8208;block metallocenes: The synthesis and structures of diphosphanylmetallocenes of s&#8208; and p&#8208;block elements are described, including the first group&#8197;15 diphosphanylmetallocene. Their application as ligands in coordination chemistry was demonstrated for different metal fragments and the reactivity of a magnesocene towards small molecules was investigated.







Abstract
Several 1,1&#8242;&#8208;diphosphanyl&#8208;substituted metallocenes of magnesium (magnesocenes) were synthesized, structurally characterized, and their reactivity and coordination chemistry were investigated. Transmetalation of these magnesocenes gives access to group&#8197;14 metallocenes (tetrelocenes), as well as to group 15 stibonocenes. These s&#8208; and p&#8208;block metallocenes represent a novel class of bis(phosphanyl) ligands, exhibiting Lewis&#8208;amphiphilic character. Their coordination chemistry towards different transition&#8208;metal and main&#8208;group fragments was investigated and different complexes are presented.

Keeping in shape: Poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;based polyrotaxanes were produced from pillar[5]arene as ring components by precipitation in water/methanol and a subsequent capping reaction. Multiple hydrogen bonds involving the pillar[5]arene OH groups were critically important for the preparation and also provided a high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polyrotaxane with heat&#8208;induced elasticity and shape memory properties without additional crosslinking.







Abstract
Poly(ethylene oxide)s (PEOs) are useful polymers with good water solubility, biological compatibility, and commercial availability. PEOs with various end groups were threaded into pillar[5]arene rings in a mixture of water and methanol to afford pseudopolyrotaxanes. Corresponding polyrotaxanes were also constructed by capping COOH&#8208;terminated pseudopolyrotaxanes with bulky amines, in which multiple hydrogen bonds involving the pillar[5]arene OH groups were critically important to prevent dethreading. The number of threaded ring components could be rationally controlled in these materials, providing a simple and versatile method to tune the mechanical and thermal properties. Specifically, a polyrotaxane with a high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight axle became elastic upon heating above the melting point of PEOs and exhibited temperature&#8208;dependent shape memory property because of the topological confinement and crosslinked hydrogen bonds.

Space for guests: Five isoreticular luminescent pillared&#8208;layer metal&#8211;organic frameworks showing CO2 uptake and the sensitive detection of nitrobenzene (NB) in aqueous solution are engineered. The NB&#8208;included framework provides direct evidence for framework&#8211;NB interactions.







Abstract
Through a dual&#8208;ligand synthetic approach, five isoreticular primitive cubic (pcu)&#8208;type pillared&#8208;layer metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), [Zn2(dicarboxylate)2(NI&#8208;bpy&#8208;44)]&#8901;x&#8201;DMF&#8901;y&#8201;H2O, in which dicarboxylate=1,4&#8208;bdc (1), Br&#8208;1,4&#8208;bdc (2), NH2&#8208;1,4&#8208;bdc (3), 2,6&#8208;ndc (4), and bpdc (5), have been engineered. MOFs 1&#8211;5 feature twofold degrees of interpenetration and have open pores of 27.0, 33.6, 36.8, 52.5, and 62.1&#8201;%, respectively. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms of activated MOFs 1&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242; at 77&#8197;K all displayed type&#8197;I adsorption behavior, suggesting their microporous nature. Although 1&#8242; and 3&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242; exhibited type&#8197;I adsorption isotherms of CO2 at 195&#8197;K, MOF 2&#8242; showed a two&#8208;step gate&#8208;opening sorption isotherm of CO2. Furthermore, MOF 3&#8242; also had a significant influence of amine functions on CO2 uptake at high temperature due to the CO2&#8211;framework interactions. MOFs 1&#8211;5 revealed solvent&#8208;dependent fluorescence properties; their strong blue&#8208;light emissions in aqueous suspensions were efficiently quenched by trace amounts of nitrobenzene (NB), with limits of detection of 4.54, 5.73, 1.88, 2.30, and 2.26&#8197;&#956;m, respectively, and Stern&#8211;Volmer quenching constants (Ksv) of 2.93&#215;103, 1.79&#215;103, 3.78&#215;103, 4.04&#215;103, and 3.21&#215;103&#8201;m&#8722;1, respectively. Of particular note, the NB&#8208;included framework, NB@3, provided direct evidence of the binding sites, which showed strong host&#8211;guest &#960;&#8211;&#960; and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions beneficial for donor&#8211;acceptor electron transfer and resulting in fluorescence quenching.

         <title>Conformational Dependence of Triplet Energies in Rotationally Hindered N&#8208; and S&#8208;Heterocyclic Dimers: New Design and Measurement Rules for High Triplet Energy OLED Host Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 21, Page 6545-6556, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of high ET heterocyclic dimers has been synthesized with large dihedral angles enforced by steric hindrance. A meta&#8208;conjugated carbazole dimer displays the highest ET of 3.07&#8197;eV in dilute polymer film, however in a neat film this falls to 2.83&#8197;eV. Similar variation is observed across the series. This work highlights that to reliably estimate host/guest compatibility, ET determined from phosphorescence of neat films must be reported for new host materials. The currently accepted practice of reporting values from frozen solution or polymer films is no substitute.







Abstract
A series of four heterocyclic dimers has been synthesized, with twisted geometries imposed across the central linking bond by ortho&#8208;alkoxy chains. These include two isomeric bicarbazoles, a bis(dibenzothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide) and a bis(thioxanthene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide). Spectroscopic and electrochemical methods, supported by density functional theory, have given detailed insights into how para&#8208; vs. meta&#8208; vs. broken conjugation, and electron&#8208;rich vs. electron&#8208;poor heterocycles impact the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap and singlet and triplet energies. Crucially for applications as OLED hosts, the triplet energy (ET) of these molecules was found to vary significantly between dilute polymer films and neat films, related to conformational demands of the molecules in the solid state. One of the bicarbazole species shows a variation in ET of 0.24&#8197;eV in the different media&#8212;sufficiently large to &#8220;make&#8208;or&#8208;break&#8221; an OLED device&#8212;with similar discrepancies found between neat films and frozen solution measurements of other previously reported OLED hosts. From consolidated optical and optoelectronic investigations of different host/dopant combinations, we identify that only the lower ET values measured in neat films give a reliable indicator of host/guest compatibility. This work also provides new molecular design rules for obtaining very high ET materials and controlling their HOMO and LUMO energies.

Quadruply bonded dimolybdenum complexes: A variety of hydride complexes with a quadruply bonded Mo2 core are presented in his article, focusing on an unusual trans&#8208;(H)Mo&#8803;Mo(H) central unit stabilized by amidinate ligands. The structure and thermodynamic stability of the different adducts have been investigated by experimental and computational techniques.







Abstract
This contribution focuses on complex [Mo2(H)2(&#956;&#8208;AdDipp2)2] (1) and tetrahydrofuran and pyridine adducts [Mo2(H)2(&#956;&#8208;AdDipp2)2(L)2] (1&#8901;thf and 1&#8901;py), which contain a trans&#8208;(H)Mo&#8803;Mo(H) core (AdDipp2=HC(NDipp2)2; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3). Computational studies provide insights into the coordination and electronic characteristics of the central trans&#8208;Mo2H2 unit of 1, with four&#8208;coordinate, fourteen&#8208;electron Mo atoms and &#1013;&#8208;agostic interactions with Dipp methyl groups. Small size C&#8208; and N&#8208;donors give rise to related complexes 1&#8901;L but only one molecule of P&#8208;donors, for example, PMe3, can bind to 1, causing one of the hydrides to form a three&#8208;centered, two&#8208;electron (3c&#8208;2e) Mo&#8208;H&#8594;Mo bond (2&#8901;PMe3). A DFT analysis of the terminal and bridging hydride coordination to the Mo&#8803;Mo bond is also reported, along with reactivity studies of the Mo&#8722;H bonds of these complexes. Reactions investigated include oxidation of 1&#8901;thf by silver triflimidate, AgNTf2, to afford a monohydride [Mo2(&#956;&#8208;H)(&#956;&#8208;NTf2)(&#956;&#8208;AdDipp2)2] (4), with an O,O&#8217;&#8208;bridging triflimidate ligand.

         <title>Helically and Linearly Fused Rylenediimide&#8208;Hexabenzocoronenes</title>

Fantastic fusion: The fusion of naphthalene&#8208; as well as perylenediimides and hexabenzocoronenes via a fully conjugated benzimidazole linker enables the formation of helical as well as linear &#960;&#8208;extended donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;hybrids applying Diels&#8211;Alder and Scholl&#8208;type chemistry. Remarkable differences in aggregation, charge&#8208;transfer (CT) stabilization as well as CT lifetimes emphasize the influence of the configuration of the bridge on donor&#8211;acceptor properties.







Abstract
Perylene&#8208; as well as naphthalenediimides were fused to hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs) at their imide position to realize highly &#960;&#8208;extended donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A)&#8208;hybrids. Successful isomer separation in the first step was decisive to guarantee a straightforward synthetic sequence. Hexaphenylbenzenes as precursors were accessed via Diels&#8211;Alder reactions and reacted in a Scholl oxidation to yield the respective HBC derivatives. The fully conjugated benzimidazole linker, which separates the electron donating HBC from the electron accepting rylenediimide, enabled the formation of either a linear or a helical configuration. Largely different chemical, physical, and optoelectrical characteristics were noted for the two configurations. What stood out was their aggregation and their excited state deactivation depending on the solvent polarity. Results from global analysis of the femtosecond transient absorption data corroborated the formation of a charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state that is stabilized in the helically fused configuration relative to the linear analogue. However, a comparison with spectroelectrochemical experiments failed to disclose evidence for a charge&#8208;separated (CS) state.

         <title>Fluorescence Response and Self&#8208;Assembly of a Tweezer&#8208;Type Synthetic Receptor Triggered by Complexation with Heme and Its Catabolites</title>

At a pinch: A tweezer&#8208;type synthetic receptor bearing sulfo&#8208;Cy5 as a hydrophilic fluorophore exhibits a significant fluorescence response upon host&#8211;guest complexation with heme in aqueous solution at pH&#8197;7.4. The complex acquires a supramolecular amphiphilic character that facilitates the formation of self&#8208;assembled aggregates. Fluorescence responses of the receptor to heme catabolites and other biologically relevant molecules were also evaluated.







Abstract
There is increasing interest in the development and applications of synthetic receptors that recognize target biomolecules in aqueous media. We have developed a new tweezer&#8208;type synthetic receptor that gives a significant fluorescence response upon complexation with heme in aqueous solution at pH&#8197;7.4. The synthetic receptor consists of a tweezer&#8208;type heme recognition site and sulfo&#8208;Cy5 as a hydrophilic fluorophore. The receptor&#8211;heme complex exhibits a supramolecular amphiphilic character that facilitates the formation of self&#8208;assembled aggregates, and both the tweezer moiety and the sulfo&#8208;Cy5 moiety are important for this property. The synthetic receptor also exhibits significant fluorescence responses to biliverdin and bilirubin, but shows very weak fluorescence responses to flavin mononucleotide, folic acid, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, which contain smaller &#960;&#8208;scaffolds.

         <title>Cover Feature: Non&#8208;coordinated and Hydrogen Bonded Phenolate Anions as One&#8208;Electron Reducing Agents (Chem. Eur. J. 21/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 21, Page 6356-6356, April 12, 2021. </description>

The superbasic tetraphosphazene is a thieving magpie on the hunt for the shiny proton. Phenols are readily deprotonated and the respective non&#8208;coordinated anions are formed in the presence of weakly Lewis&#8208;acidic phosphazenium counterions. Strongly nucleophilic non&#8208;coordinated phenolates excel as reducing agents for the generation of radical anion salts and for the activation of SF6. Their high Lewis&#8208;basicity is accompanied by a pronounced tendency for hydrogen bonding, which is perceptible in their chemical behavior. More information can be found in the Full Paper by B. Hoge et&#8197;al. on page 6460.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The superbasic tetraphosphazene&lt;/b&gt; is a thieving magpie on the hunt for the shiny proton. Phenols are readily deprotonated and the respective non&#8208;coordinated anions are formed in the presence of weakly Lewis&#8208;acidic phosphazenium counterions. Strongly nucleophilic non&#8208;coordinated phenolates excel as reducing agents for the generation of radical anion salts and for the activation of SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. Their high Lewis&#8208;basicity is accompanied by a pronounced tendency for hydrogen bonding, which is perceptible in their chemical behavior. More information can be found in the Full Paper by B. Hoge et&#8197;al. on page &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202005123"&gt;6460&lt;/a&gt;.

Coordination complexes of iridium(III) are potential candidates for photodynamic therapy. Phenylpyridyl&#8208; and Cp*&#8208;containing (dipyrrinato)iridium(III) complexes with a multitude of functional groups at the dipyrrin moieties were synthesized and the phototoxic activity of the complexes evaluated in tumor and bacterial cell assays. The Cp*&#8208;containing and glycosylated dipyrrinato&#8208;phenylpyridyl complexes are promising photoactive agents, as visualized in the cover design by Ella Marushchenko. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M.&#8197;O. Senge, A. Wiehe, et&#8197;al. on page 6440.

         <dc:description>
In their Review on page&#8197;6367&#8197;ff., Phillip Grant and Margaret Brimble examine the isolation, bioactivity, and total synthesis of seco&#8208;labdane diterpenoids&#8212;a class of diterpenoid arising from C&#8722;C bond cleavage events. In doing so, the importance of biosynthetic C&#8722;C bond cleavage to the generation of structural diversity is highlighted.

         <title>Cover Feature: Non&#8208;Coordinated Phenolate Anions and Their Application in SF6 Activation (Chem. Eur. J. 21/2021)</title>

         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;coordinated phenolate anion ([H5C6&#8208;O]&#8722; is easily accessible by deprotonation of phenol with the superbasic perethyl tetraphosphazene Schwesinger base, while monophosphazenes only deliver the hydrogen&#8208;bonded phenol&#8211;phenolate adduct. Hydrogen bonding influences the electron donation and brings about lowered redox potentials. Synthesized electron&#8208;rich non&#8208;coordinated phenolates featuring strong redox potentials are capable for the SF6 activation and lead to pentafluorosulfanide [SF5]&#8722; salts. More information can be found in the Communication by B. Hoge et&#8197;al. on page 6465.

         <dc:description>
Alloying chemistry affords high Li/Na/K content per formula and therefore high capacities. In particular, metals with low melting points (LMP) are thermodynamically preferable for the electrochemical alloying process, some of which also exhibit high flexibility, ductility, or even fluidity, which facilitates electrode fabrication. In their minireview on page&#8197;6407&#8197;ff., Q. Li, G. He, and Y. Ding summarize the recent progress of typical LMP metals such as In, Ga, and Hg in rechargeable batteries.

Polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based nanomaterials that are functionalized with and/or have encapsulated organic structures have been demonstrated to have promising potential to combat against cancer regarding early diagnosis and effective therapy owing to their inherent elemental composition, structural stability, good biocompatibility and feasibility to modification. In this contribution, the latest achievement of POM&#8208;based nanomaterials in cancer diagnosis and therapeutics are highlighted to put forward our fundamental viewpoints on the design principles of modified POMs based on their application. The recent advances reported in the Minireview by Na Li, Bo Tang and co&#8208;workers provide a promising guideline for cancer theranostics of POM&#8208;based hybrid nanomaterials.

Polyrotaxanes constructed from hydrogen&#8208;bonding pillar[5]arene rings and poly(ethylene oxide) chains were synthesized. A polyrotaxane with a high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight poly(ethylene oxide) chain showed temperature&#8208;dependent shape memory properties, because of the topological confinement and cross&#8208;linked hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen bond networks constructed from pillar[5]arene rings and poly(ethylene oxide) chains are illustrated as music notes and staff notation, respectively. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T. Ogoshi et&#8197;al. on page 6435.

Preparation on large scales: Precursor&#8211;solvent combinations used to produce metal sulfide nanoparticles through multiple pathways are discussed herein. The production of metal sulfide nanoparticles, which are valuable in a plethora of applications, is discussed and it is highlighted how the establishment of new methods will help to standardize and increase production capabilities.







Abstract
Fascination with and the need for evermore increasing efficiency, power, or strength have been the cornerstones for developing new materials and methods for their creation. Higher solar cell conversion efficiencies, increased battery storage power, and lightweight strong materials are some that have been at the forefront of attention for these efforts. Materials created for most applications start as simple chemical compounds. A study of how these chemicals have been used in the past can be used to create new materials and new methods of production. Herein, a class of materials that are valuable in a multitude of applications, metal sulfide nanoparticles, are examined, along with how they are being produced and how new methods can be established that will help to standardize and increase production capabilities. Precursor&#8211;solvent combinations that can be used to create metal sulfide nanoparticles in the gas phase are also explored.

         <title>Applications of Low&#8208;Melting&#8208;Point Metals in Rechargeable Metal Batteries</title>

Low&#8208;melting&#8208;point metals: Alloying chemistry affords high Li/Na/K content per formula and therefore high capacities. In particular, metals with low melting points (LMP) are thermodynamically preferable for the electrochemical alloying process, some of which also exhibit high flexibility, ductility, or even fluidity, which facilitates electrode fabrication. This minireview summarizes the recent progress of typical LMP metals such as In, Ga, and Hg in rechargeable batteries.







Abstract
Low&#8208;melting&#8208;point (LMP) metals represent an interesting family of electrode materials owing to their high ionic conductivity, good ductility or fluidity, low hardness and/or superior alloying capability, all of which are crucial characteristics to address battery challenges such as interfacial incompatibility, electrode pulverization, and dendrite growth. This minireview summarizes recent research progress of typical LMP metals including In, Ga, Hg, and their alloys in rechargeable metal batteries. Emphasis is placed on mainstream electrochemical storage devices of Li, Na, and K batteries as well as the representative multi&#8208;valent metal batteries. The fundamental correlations between unique physiochemical properties of LMP metals and the battery performance are highlighted. In addition, this article also provides insights into future development and potential directions of LMP metals/alloys for practical applications.

         <title>seco&#8208;Labdanes: A Study of Terpenoid Structural Diversity Resulting from Biosynthetic C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage</title>

Bond cleavage in synthesis: This review examines the isolation, bioactivity, and total synthesis of seco&#8208;labdane diterpenoids&#8212;a class of diterpenoid arising from C&#8722;C bond cleavage events. In doing so, the importance of biosynthetic C&#8722;C bond cleavage to the generation of structural diversity is highlighted.







Abstract
The cleavage of a C&#8722;C bond is a complexity generating process, which complements oxidation and cyclisation events in the biosynthesis of terpenoids. This process leads to increased structural diversity in a cluster of related secondary metabolites by modification of the parent carbocyclic core. In this review, we highlight the diversifying effect of C&#8722;C bond cleavage by examining the literature related to seco&#8208;labdanes&#8212;a class of diterpenoids arising from such C&#8722;C bond cleavage events.

In this minireview, the advanced progress of polyoxometalate&#8208;based nanomaterials for cancer diagnosis and therapy including magnetic resonance imaging, biological nanoprobes, photothermal therapy, radiotherapy, chemodynamic therapy and multimodal imaging&#8208;guided combined therapy are summarized.







Abstract
As an emerging class of inorganic metal oxides, organically functionalized polyoxometalates (POMs) or POM&#8208;based nanohybrids have been demonstrated promising potential for the inhibition of various cancer types by the virtue of their diversity in structures and significantly reduced toxicity. This contribution summarizes the latest achievement of POM&#8208;based nanomaterials in cancer diagnosis and various therapeutics to put forward our fundamental viewpoints on the design principles of modified POMs based on their application. In addition, major challenges and perspectives in this field are also discussed. We expect that this review will provide a valuable and systematic reference for the further development of POM&#8208;based nanomaterials.

         <title>Non&#8208;Coordinated Phenolate Anions and Their Application in SF6 Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 21, Page 6460-6464, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;coordinated phenolate anions: By deprotonation of phenol with the strong tetraphosphazene Schwesinger base a salt of the so far unknown free phenolate anion was formed. In contrast to that, the deprotonation with a less basic monophosphazene base leads to a phenol&#8211;phenolate salt with an additional hydrogen bond to the phosphazenium cation. Applying electron&#8208;rich phenolate salts we further present the two&#8208;electron reduction of SF6 leading to [SF5]&#8722; and F&#8722; salts.







Abstract
The reaction of the strong monophosphazene base with the weakly acidic phenol leads to the formation of a phenol&#8211;phenolate anion with a moderately strong hydrogen bond. Application of the more powerful tetraphosphazene base (Schwesinger base) renders the isolation of the corresponding salt with a free phenolate anion possible. This compound represents the first species featuring the free phenolate anion [H5C6&#8208;O]&#8722;. The deprotonation of phenol derivatives with tetraphosphazene bases represents a great way for the clean preparation of salts featuring free phenolate anions and in addition allows the selective syntheses of hydrogen bonded phenol&#8208;phenolate salts. This work presents a phosphazenium phenolate salt with a redox potential of &#8722;0.72&#8197;V and its capability for the selective activation of the chemically inert greenhouse gas SF6. The performed two&#8208;electron reduction of SF6 leads to phosphazenium pentafluorosulfanide ([SF5]&#8722;) and fluoride salts.

         <title>G4 Sensing Pyridyl&#8208;thiazole Polyamide Represses c&#8208;KIT Expression in Leukemia Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Specific sensing and functional tuning of nucleic acid secondary structures remain less explored till date. Herein, we report a thiazole polyamide  TPW  that binds specifically to  c&#8208;KIT1  G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) with sub&#8208;micromolar affinity and ~ 1:1 stoichiometry and represses  c&#8208;KIT  proto&#8208;oncogene expression.  TPW  shows up to 10 fold increase in fluorescence upon binding with  c&#8208;KIT1  G4, but shows weak or no quantifiable binding to other G4s and  ds26 DNA  .  TPW  can increase the number of G4&#8208;specific antibody (BG4) foci and mark G4 structures in cancer cells. Cell&#8208;based assays reveal that  TPW  can efficiently repress  c&#8208;KIT  expression in leukemia cells via a G4&#8208;dependent process. Thus, the polyamide can serve as a promising probe for G&#8208;quadruplex recognition with the ability to specifically alter  c&#8208;KIT  oncogene expression.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Effects of Incorporation of 2'&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;2'2'&#8208;Difluorodeoxycytidine (Gemcitabine) in A&#8208; and B&#8208;Form Duplexes</title>

         <dc:description>
2'&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;2',2'&#8208;difluorocytidine (gemcitabine) is an adaptable nucleotide derivative that can adopt a North type sugar conformation when inserted in pure DNA (B&#8208;form helix), or a South sugar conformation in the context of DNA&#8201;:&#8201;RNA hybrids (A&#8208;form helix).







Abstract
We report the structural effect of 2'&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2',2'&#8208;difluorocytidine (dFdC) insertions in the DNA strand of a DNA&#8201;:&#8201;RNA hybrid duplex and in a self&#8208;complementary DNA&#8201;:&#8201;DNA duplex. In both cases, the modification slightly destabilizes the duplex and provokes minor local distortions that are more pronounced in the case of the DNA&#8201;:&#8201;RNA hybrid. Analysis of the solution structures determined by NMR methods show that dFdC is an adaptable derivative that adopts North type sugar conformation when inserted in pure DNA, or a South sugar conformation in the context of DNA&#8201;:&#8201;RNA hybrids. In this latter context, South sugar pucker favors the formation of a 2'F&#8901;&#8901;H8 attractive interaction with a neighboring purine, which compensates the destabilizing effect of base pair distortions. These interactions share some features with pseudohydrogen bonds described previously in other nucleic acids structures with fluorine modified sugars.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Borylation of Aryl Sulfoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A nickel/N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalytic system has been developed for the borylation of aryl sulfoxides with B2(neop)2 (neop = neopentyl glycolato). A wide range of aryl sulfoxides with different electronic and steric properties were converted into the corresponding arylboronic esters in good yields. The regioselective borylation of unsymmetric diaryl sulfoxides was also feasible leading to borylation of the sterically less encumbered aryl substituent. Competition experiments demonstrated that an electron&#8208;deficient aryl moiety reacts preferentially. The origin of the selectivity in the Ni&#8208;catalyzed borylation of electronically biased unsymmetrical diaryl sulfoxide lies in the oxidative addition step of the catalytic cycle, as oxidative addition of methoxyphenyl 4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)phenyl sulfoxide to the Ni(0) complex occurs selectively to give the structurally characterized complex trans&#8208;[Ni(ICy)2(4&#8208;CF3&#8208;C6H4){(SO)&#8208;4&#8208;MeO&#8208;C6H4}] 4. For complex 5, the isomer trans&#8208;[Ni(ICy)2(C6H5)(OSC6H5)] 5&#8208;I was structurally characterized in which the phenyl sulfinyl ligand is bound via the oxygen atom to nickel. In solution, the complex trans&#8208;[Ni(ICy)2(C6H5)(OSC6H5)] 5&#8208;I is in equilibrium with the S&#8208;bonded isomer trans&#8208;[Ni(ICy)2(C6H5)(SOC6H5)] 5, as shown by NMR spectroscopy. DFT calculations reveal that these isomers are separated by a mere 0.3 kJ/mol (M06/def2&#8208;TZVP&#8208;level of theory) and connected via a transition state trans&#8208;[Ni(ICy)2(C6H5)(&#951;2&#8208;{SO}&#8208;C6H5)], which lies only 10.8 kcal/mol above 5.</dc:description>

Methylcarbonates and CO2 or COS &#8208; First Insight into Co&#8208;ordination
Chemistry of New Ambident Ligands</title>

         <dc:description>We present highly regioselective syntheses of 1,2&#8208;dicarboxylated cyclopentadienide salts [Cat]  2  [C  5  H  3  (CO  2  )  2  H] by reaction of a variety of organic cation methylcarbonate salts [Cat]OCO  2  Me (Cat = NR  4  +  , PR  4  +  , Im  +  ) with cyclopentadiene (CpH) or by simply reacting organic cation cyclopentadienides Cat[Cp] (Cat = NR  4  +  , PR  4  +  , Im  +  ) with CO  2  . One characteristic feature of these dianionic ligands is the acidic proton delocalized in an intramolecular hydrogen bridge (IHB) between the two carboxyl groups, as studied by  1  H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy and XRD analyses. The reaction cannot be stopped after the first carboxylation. Therefore, we propose a Kolbe&#8208;Schmitt phenol&#8208;carboxylation related mechanism where the acidic proton of the monocarboxylic acid intermediate plays an  ortho&#8208;  directing and CO  2  activating role for the second kinetically accelerated CO  2  addition step exclusively in  ortho  position. The same and related thiocarboxylates [Cat]  2  [C  5  H  3  (COS)  2  H] are obtained by reaction of COS with Cat[Cp] (Cat = NR  4  +  , PR  4  +  , Im  +  ). A preliminary study on [Cat]  2  [C  5  H  3  (CO  2  )  2  H] reveals, that its soft and hard coordination sites can selectively be addressed by soft Lewis acids (Mo  0  , Ru  2+  ) and hard Lewis acids (Al  3+  , La  3+  ).</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and anti&#8208;selective addition of silylboronates to unsymmetric internal alkynes has been developed for the synthesis of structurally defined tetrasubstituted alkenes. A variety of unactivated alkynes can be employed with high selectivity under simple and mild conditions and the resulting products have been further functionalized by utilizing silyl and boryl groups on the alkene.







Abstract
As a new and complementary method for the synthesis of structurally defined tetrasubstituted alkenes, a copper&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and anti&#8208;selective addition of silylboronates to unsymmetric internal alkynes has been developed. A variety of unactivated alkynes can be employed with high selectivity under simple and mild conditions, and the resulting products have been further functionalized by utilizing silyl and boryl groups on the alkene.

         <title>Accelerating H2 Evolution by Anodic Semi&#8208;dehydrogenation of Tetrahydroisoquinolines in Water over Co3O4 Nanoribbon Arrays Decorated Nickel Foam</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semi&#8208;dehydrogenation conversion based on a cobalt electrocatalyst was employed to accelerate hydrogen evolution in water. The Co3O4 nanoribbon arrays modified nickel foam anode provided rich active sites for the transformation of tetrahydroisoquinolines into various value&#8208;added dihydroisoquinolines. Electro&#8208;activated higher&#8208;valent cobalt and plenty of surface oxygen species were responsible for promoting the electrocatalytic oxidation.







Abstract
Coupling the H2 evolution reaction in water with thermodynamically favorable organic oxidation reactions is highly desirable, because it can enhance the energy conversion efficiency compared with electrocatalytic water splitting, and produce value&#8208;added chemicals instead of O2 in the anodic reaction. Herein, Co3O4 nanoribbon arrays in&#8197;situ grown on nickel foam (Co3O4@NF) was employed as an effective electrocatalyst for the selective oxidation of tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs). Various value&#8208;added semi&#8208;dehydrogenation products including dihydroisoquinolines with electro&#8208;deficient or &#8208;rich groups could be obtained with moderate yields and faradaic efficiencies. Benefitting from the rich surface active sites of Co3O4@NF, a two&#8208;electrode (Co3O4@NF||Pt) electrolytic system drove a benchmark current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a cell voltage as low as 1.446&#8197;V in 1.0&#8197;M KOH aqueous solution containing 0.02&#8197;M THIQ, which was reduced by 174&#8197;mV in comparison with that of overall water splitting.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Chiroptical Properties of Indolo&#8208; and Pyridopyrrolo&#8208;Carbazole&#8208;Based C2&#8208;Symmetric Azahelicenes</title>

         <dc:description>
Azahelicenes bearing an indolocarbazole backbone were prepared by a step&#8208;economic double dehydrogenative cyclization under palladium catalysis. Their optical resolutions were attained by chiral HPLC. The pyridopyrrolo derivative (X=N, R=H) was found to show ca. 6 times larger dissymmetry factors than those of the parent azahelicene (X=CH, R=H) in both CD and CPL measurements. The CPL color could be switched by addition of an acid or introduction of a donor substituent R.







Abstract
Treatment of 11,12&#8208;bis(1,1&#8217;&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;3&#8208;yl or 6&#8208;phenylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;substituted 11,12&#8208;dihydro&#8208;indolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole with an oxidizing system of Pd(II)/Ag(I) induced effective double dehydrogenative cyclization to afford the corresponding &#960;&#8208;extended azahelicenes. The optical resolutions were readily achieved by a preparative chiral HPLC. It was found that the pyridopyrrolo&#8208;carbazole&#8208;based azahelicene that contains four nitrogen atoms exhibits ca. 6 times larger dissymmetry factors both in circularly dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), |gCD| and |gCPL| values being 1.1&#215;10&#8722;2 and 4.4&#215;10&#8722;3, respectively, as compared with the parent indolocarbazole&#8208;based azahelicene. Theoretical calculations at the RI&#8208;CC2 level were employed to rationalize the observed enhanced chiroptical responses. The (chir)optical properties of the former helicene was further tuned by a protonation leading to remarkable red&#8208;shift with a considerable enhancement of the |gCPL| value.

         <title>Iridoid Sex Pheromone Biosynthesis in Aphids Mimics Iridoid&#8208;Producing Plants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural product biosynthesis in animals: Chemical synthesis of isotopically&#8208;labelled molecular probes and topical application using female pea aphids, Acyrthosiphon pisum, are deployed along with coupled GC&#8208;mass spectrometry (GC&#8208;MS) to show that biosynthesis of the female&#8208;produced aphid sex pheromone components (1R,4aS,7S,7aR)&#8208;nepetalactol (1) and (4aS,7S,7aR)&#8208;nepetalactone (2) may follow a broadly similar route to that characterized for plants.







Abstract
Biosynthesis of (1R,4aS,7S,7aR)&#8208;nepetalactol (1) and (4aS,7S,7aR)&#8208;nepetalactone (2) in plants involves iridoid synthase (ISY), an atypical reductive cyclase that catalyses the reduction of 8&#8208;oxogeranial into the reactive enol of (S)&#8208;8&#8208;oxocitronellal, and cyclization of this enol intermediate, either non&#8208;enzymatically or by a nepetalactol&#8208;related short chain dehydrogenase enzyme (NEPS) that yields the nepetalactols. In this study, we investigated the biosynthesis in&#8197;vivo of 1 and 2 in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, using a library of isotopically&#8208;labelled monoterpenoids as molecular probes. Topical application of deuterium&#8208;labelled probes synthesized from geraniol and nerol resulted in production of 2H4&#8722;lactol 1 and 2H4&#8722;lactone 2. However, deuterium incorporation was not evident using labelled probes synthesized from (S)&#8208;citronellol. These results suggest that iridoid biosynthesis in animals, specifically aphids, may follow a broadly similar route to that characterised for plants.

         <title>Synthesis of Lignans based on a Borate&#8208;mediated One&#8208;pot Sequential Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Coupling of Cyclic Boranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lignans are a group of polyphenolic phytochemicals that possess a large spectrum of chemical structures and biological activities. Here the syntheses of lignans&#8212;anwulignan, burseran, dehydroxycubebin ruburisandrin B, and sesamin are achieved based on a borate&#8208;mediated one&#8208;pot sequential Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling of  cis  &#8208; and  trans  &#8208;fused bicyclic boranes. The  cis  &#8208; and  trans  &#8208;bicyclic boranes were prepared by diastereoselective cyclic hydroboration of exo&#8208;cyclic diene with cyclopentyl&#8208; and thexylboranes, respectively. A one&#8208;pot sequential Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling of each cyclic borate with various aryl bromides initiated by activation of the cyclic borane with the carbon nucleophile provided 2,3&#8208;dibenzylbutane derivatives with varied aromatic substituents. Finally, the syntheses of naturally occurring lignans were accomplished in several steps from the products of Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling.</dc:description>

         <title>Click Chemistry in Ultra&#8208;high Vacuum &#8208; Tetrazine Coupling with Methyl Enol Ether Covalently Linked to Si(001)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The additive&#8208;free tetrazine/enol ether click reaction was performed in ultra&#8208;high vacuum (UHV) with an enol ether group covalently linked to a silicon surface: Dimethyl 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine&#8208;3,6&#8208;dicarboxylate molecules were coupled to the enol ether group of a functionalized cyclooctyne which was adsorbed on the silicon (001) surface via the strained triple bond of cyclooctyne. The reaction was observed at a substrate temperature of 380 K by means of X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). A moderate energy barrier was deduced for this click reaction in vacuum by means of density functional theory based calculations, in good agreement with the experimental results. This UHV&#8208;compatible click reaction thus opens a new, flexible route for synthesizing covalently bound organic architectures.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Arylation via ortho C&#8208;H activation by the aid of directing groups is explored recently by many researchers. Herein, we have developed a palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H arylation using 8&#8208;aminoquinoline as a bidentate directing group. We have overserved that the reaction furnishes only C&#8208;H arylation unlike previous methods where cyclization to corresponding isoquinolones is observed. More interestingly, we have observed sequential C&#8208;H functionalization when methylacrylate and acrylonitrile was added which underwent C&#8208;H olefination with the aryl group which was installed from aryne precursor.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Effect of NiLDH@YZ Hybrid and Mechanochemical Agitation on Glaser Homocoupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of nickel&#8208;layered double hydroxide amalgamated to Y&#8208;zeolite (NiLDH@YZ) hybrids and evaluation of the synergistic effect of various NiLDH@YZ catalysts and mechanochemical agitation on Glaser homocoupling reactions. Nitrogen adsorption&#8208;desorption experiments were carried out to estimate the surface area and porosity of NiLDH@YZ hybrids. The basicity and acidity of these hybrids were determined by CO  2  &#8208;TPD and NH  3  &#8208;TPD experiments respectively and this portrayed good acid&#8208;base bifunctional feature of the catalysts. The NiLDH@YZ catalyzed mechanochemical Glaser coupling reaction achieved best yield of 83% for 0.5NiLDH@0.5YZ hybrid after 60 mins of agitation, which revealed the highest acid&#8208;base bifunctional feature compared to all the investigated catalysts. The developed catalyst has proven itself as a robust and effective candidate that can be successfully employed up to four catalytic cycles without significant loss in catalytic activity, under optimized reaction conditions. This work demonstrated a new strategy for C&#8211;C bond formation enabled by the synergy between mechanochemistry and heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of the new bulky vinyllithium reagent&#160;(MeIPr=CH)Li, (MeIPr = [(MeCNDipp)2C]; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;  iPr2C6H3  ) is&#160;reported. This vinyllithium precursor was found to act as a general&#160;source of the anionic 2&#963;, 2&#960;&#8208;electron donor ligand [MeIPr=CH]&#8722;  .&#160;Furthermore a high&#8208;yielding route to the degradation&#8208;resistant SiII  &#160;precursor  MePr&#8226;SiBr2  is presented.

         <title>Programmed Multiple C&#8211;H Bond Functionalization of the Privileged 4&#8208;hydroxyquinoline Template</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of substituents on bare heterocyclic scaffolds can selectively be achieved by directed C&#8211;H functionalization. However, such methods have only occasionally been used, in an iterative manner, to decorate various positions of a medicinal scaffold to build chemical libraries. We herein report the multiple, site selective, metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H functionalization of a "programmed" 4&#8208;hydroxyquinoline. This medicinally privileged template indeed possesses multiple reactive sites for diversity&#8208;oriented functionalization, of which four were targeted. The C&#8208;2 and C&#8208;8 decorations were directed by an  N  &#8208;oxide, before taking benefit of an  O  &#8208;carbamoyl protection at C&#8208;4 to perform a Fries rearrangement and install a carboxamide at C&#8208;3. This also released the carbonyl group of 4&#8208;quinolones, the ultimate directing group to functionalize position 5. Our study highlights the power of multiple C&#8211;H functionalization to generate diversity in a biologically relevant library, after showing its strong antimalarial potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Soluble Congeners of Prior Insoluble Shape&#8208;Persistent Imine Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the most applied reaction types to synthesize shape&#8208;persistent organic cage compounds is the imine condensation reaction and it is assumed that the formed cages are thermodynamically controlled products due to the reversibility of the imine condensation. However, most of the synthesized imine cages reported are formed as precipitate from the reaction mixture and therefore rather may be kinetically controlled products. There are even examples in literature, where resulting cages are not soluble at all in common organic solvents to characterize or study their formation by NMR spectroscopy in solution. Here, a triptycene triamine containing three solubilizing n&#8208;hexyloxy chains has been used to synthesize soluble congeners of prior insoluble cages. This allowed us to study the formation as well the reversibility of cage formation in solution by investigating exchange of building blocks between the cages and deuterated derivatives thereof.</dc:description>

         <title>Natural&#8208;like Spirocyclic &#916;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;Butenolides Obtained from Diazo Homophthalimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Diazo homophotalimides were reacted with various propiolic acids on Rh  2  (esp)  2  catalysis. The resulting propiolate esters were transformed into novel, heterocyclic &#916;  &#945;,&#946;  &#8208;spirobutenolides in good to excellent product yields. The approach represents a fundamentally novel entry into natural&#8208;like &#916;  &#945;,&#946;  &#8208;spirobutenolides present in many biologically active natural products as well as fully synthetic compounds endowed with diverse biological activities. The &#916;  &#945;,&#946;  &#8208;spirobutenolides thus obtained were shown to inhibit thioredoxin reductase, a selenocysteine enzyme target for cancer. Moreover, for the best compound in the series (TrxR IC  50  1.49 &#177; 0.08 &#956;M), it was shown, using MALDI&#8208;TOF mass&#8208;spectrometry, that it selectively binds selenocysteine in the presence of a 10&#8208;fold excess of cysteine. This validates the new compound as a promising lead for anticancer therapy development.</dc:description>

         <title>Using the Interaction between Copper and Manganese to Stabilize Copper Single&#8208;atom for CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interaction between Cu and Mn was utilized to immobilize Cu single&#8208;atom on MnO2  surface by redox&#8208;driven hydrolysis method. Comprehensive structure and properties characterization demonstrate that the existence of Cu&#8208;Mn interaction on the catalyst surface can effectively restrain the aggregation of Cu single atoms and improve CO oxidation activity. The interaction of forming Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Mn entity is beneficial for CO catalytic activity since the migration of reactive oxygen species and the coordination effect of active centers accelerate the reaction. In particular, 3%&#8208;Cu1/MnO2  shows the more 10&#8208;fold oxygen storage capacity (OSC) value (342.75 &#956;mol/g) than pure MnO2  (27.79 &#956;mol/g) and performs the high activity of CO ( T90% = 80  oC), it can retain CO conversion of 95% after 15 times circulation. This work offers a reliable method for synthesizing Cu SACs and deepens the understanding of the interaction effect between transition metal single&#8208;atom and support that can improve the catalytic activity of CO oxidation.</dc:description>

Here, we present a 2D chiral hybrid halide perovskite ferroelectric, [C  6  H  5  (CH  2  )  4  NH  3  ]  2  CdCl  4  (  4PBA&#8208;CdCl  4  ,  4PBA  = 4&#8208;Phenylbutylamine), which experiences two continuous phase transitions from centrosymmetric triclinic  P  &#160; to polar chiral monoclinic  P  2 and then to another centrosymmetric tetragonal  P  4  /mmm  with increasing temperature, accompanied by symmetry breaking, due to the prominent octahedral distortion and disorder transformation of organic  4PBA  cations. Under polar chiral phase,  4PBA&#8208;CdCl  4  exhibits a significant CD signal and a moderate ferroelectric polarization of 0.35 &#956;C/cm  2  . In addition,  4PBA&#8208;CdCl  4  occupies a wide band gap of 4.376 eV and is chiefly contributed by inorganic CdCl  6  octahedron. This finding offers an alternative pathway for designing new phase transitions and related physical properties in hybrid halide perovskites and other hybrid crystals.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Oxygen defects and hollow structures positively impact pseudocapacitive properties of diffusion/surface&#8208;controlled processes, a component of critical importance when building high&#8208;performance supercapacitors. Hence, we fabricated hollow nickel/cobalt molybdate rods with O&#8208;defects (D&#8208;H&#8208;NiMoO  4  @CoMoO  4  ) via a soft&#8208;template and partial reduction method, enhancing D&#8208;H&#8208;NiMoO  4  @CoMoO  4  &#8217;s electrochemical performance, yielding a specific capacitance of 1329 F g  &#8208;1  , and demonstrating excellent durability with 95.8% capacity retention after 3000 cycles. D&#8208;H&#8208;NiMoO  4  @CoMoO  4  &#160;was used as the positive electrode to construct an asymmetric supercapacitor, displaying an energy density of up to 34.13 W h kg  &#8208;1  &#160;and demonstrating good predisposition towards practical applications. This work presents an effective approach to fabricate and use hollow nickel/cobalt molybdate rods with O&#8208;defects as pseudo&#8208;capacitor material for high&#8208;performance capacitive energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Tetrahedranes Containing the Unique Bridging Hetero&#8208;Dipnictogen Ligand EE' (E &#8800;&#160;E'&#160;=&#160;P, As, Sb, Bi)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In order to improve and extend the rare class of tetrahedral mixed main group transition metal compounds, a new synthetic route for the complexes [{CpMo(CO)  2  }  2  (&#181;,&#951;  2  :&#951;  2  &#8208;  PE  )] (E = As (  1  ), Sb (  2  )) is described leading to higher yields and a decrease in reaction steps. Via this route, also the so far unknown heavier analogues containing  AsSb  (  3a  ),  AsBi  (  4  ) and  SbBi  (  5  ) ligands, respectively, are accessible.  Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments and DFT calculations reveal that they represent very rare examples of compounds comprising covalent bonds between two different heavy pnictogen atoms,  which show multiple bond character and are stabilised without any organic substituents. &#160;  A simple one&#8208;pot reaction of [CpMo(CO)  2  ]  2  with ME(SiMe  3  )  2  (M = Li, K; E = P, As, Sb, Bi) and the subsequent addition of PCl  3  , AsCl  3  , SbCl  3  or BiCl  3  , respectively, give the complexes  1  &#8211;  5  . This synthesis is also transferable to the already known homo&#8208;dipnictogen complexes [{CpMo(CO)  2  }  2  (&#181;,&#951;  2  :&#951;  2  &#8208;  E  2  )] (E = P, As, Sb, Bi) resulting in higher yields comparable to those in the literature procedures and allows the introduction of the bulkier and better soluble Cp' (Cp' = tert butylcyclopentadienyl) ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed Deuteration of Aromatic Carbonyl Compounds with a Catalytic Transient Directing Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H activation methodology for hydrogen isotope exchange of aromatic carbonyl compounds is presented. In the presence of catalytic amounts of specific amine additives, a transient directing group is formed  in situ  , which directs selective deuteration. A high degree of deuteration is achieved for  &#945;&#8208;  carbonyl and aromatic  ortho&#8208;  positions. In addition, appropriate choice of conditions allows for exclusive labeling of the  &#945;&#8208;  carbonyl position while a procedure for the preparation of merely  ortho  &#8208;deuterated compounds is also reported. This methodology proceeds with good functional group tolerance and can be also applied for deuteration of pharmaceutical drugs. Mechanistic studies reveal a kinetic isotope effect of 2.2, showing that the C&#8208;H activation is likely the rate&#8208;determining step of the catalytic cycle. Using deuterium oxide as a cheap and convenient source of deuterium, the methodology presents a cost&#8208;efficient alternative to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art iridium&#8208;catalyzed procedures.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Highly Functionalizable Unsymmetrically&#8208; and Symmetrically&#8208;Substituted Triarylboranes from Bench&#8208;Stable Boron Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel and convenient methodology for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of sterically congested triarylboranes, using bench&#8208;stable aryltrifluoroborates as the boron source, is reported. This new procedure gives systematic access to symmetrically&#8208; and unsymmetrically&#8208;substituted triarylboranes of the types BAr  2  Ar&#8217; and BArAr&#8217;Ar&#8217;&#8217;, respectively. Four unsymmetrically&#8208;substituted triarylboranes, as well as their iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H borylation products, are reported. These borylated triarylboranes contain at least one and up to three positions that can subsequently be orthogonally functionalized in follow up reactions, such as Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings or Sonogashira couplings.</dc:description>

The chemical transformation of a 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl moiety embedded in a cage&#8208;opened fullerene C60 derivative was examined to produce &#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphorus ylide, &#945;&#8208;methylene carbonyl, and acid anhydride compounds. The former two showed a significantly supressed encapsulation/escape dynamics of a water molecule as well as electrochemical properties largely different from the last one.







Abstract
A 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl moiety on a cage&#8208;opened fullerene skeleton is one of suitable building blocks for the further derivatization. Herein, we discuss the chemical transformation of a 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl compound into &#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphorus ylide, acid anhydride, and &#945;&#8208;methylene carbonyl derivatives. Despite possessing a sterically small methylene unit in the last one, the release of an encapsulated water molecule was significantly supressed whereas the &#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphorus ylide bearing three bulky p&#8208;tolyl groups on the P&#8208;atom enabled the faster insertion/release dynamics, implying the flexibility of the phosphonium substituent. The replacement of the carbonyl group with phosphorus ylide and methylene units largely varied electrochemical properties of the fullerene skeleton, likely arising from the anionic charge delocalized over the entire molecule and removal of an electron&#8208;withdrawable carbonyl group, respectively.

         <dc:description>
Multicomponent dynagels for heparin encapsulation: Dynamic covalently cross&#8208;linked dynamers with high mechanical strength, biocompatibility and self&#8208;healing behaviors have been used for biomedical applications.







Abstract
Double cross&#8208;linked dynamic hydrogels, dynagels, have been prepared through reversible imine bonds and supramolecular interactions, which showed good pH responsiveness, injectability, self&#8208;healing property and biocompatibility. With the further encapsulation of heparin, the obtained hydrogels exhibited good anti&#8208;bacterial activity and promotion effects for 3D cell culture.

         <title>Shape&#8208;adaptability and redox&#8208;switching properties of a di&#8208;gold metallotweezer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the use of a carbazolyl&#8208;connected di&#8208;gold(I) metallotweezer for the encapsulation of several electronpoor organic substrates, and a planar Au(III) complex containing a CNC pincer ligand. The binding affinity of the receptor depends on the electron&#8208;deficient character of the planar guest, with larger association constants found for the more electronpoor guests. The X&#8208;ray diffraction molecular structures of two host:guest adducts, shows that the host approaches its arms in order to facilitate the optimum interaction with the surface of the planar guests, in a clear example of an guest&#8208;induced fit conformational arrangement. The electrochemical studies of the encapsulation of N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;naphthalenetetracarboxy diimide (NTCDI) show that the redox active guest is released from the receptor upon one electron reduction, thus constituting an example of redox&#8208;switchable binding.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrophobic POM Electrocatalyst Achieves Low Voltage &#8220;Charge&#8221; in Zn&#8208;air Battery Coupled with Bisphenol A Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zn&#8208;air battery is a perspective power source for grid&#8208;storage. But, after they are discharged at 1.1 to 1.2 V, large overpotential is required for their charging, usually 2.5 V. This is due to sluggish the oxygen evolution reaction (OER); Incorporating organic pollutants into the cathode electrolyte is a feasible strategy for lowering the required charging potential. On the other hand, in discharge process related oxygen reduction reaction, hydrophobic electrocatalyst is more popular than hydrophilic one. Here, a hydrophobic bi&#8208;functional polyoxometalate electrocatalyst is synthesized by precise structural design. It shows excellent activities in both bisphenol A degradation and oxygen reduction reactions. In bisphenol A containing electrolyte, to achieve 100 mA&#183;cm  &#8208;2  , its potential is only 1.32 V, which is 0.34 V lower than oxygen evolution reaction. In oxygen reduction reaction, this electrocatalyst follows four&#8208;electron mechanism. In both bisphenol A degradation and oxygen reduction reactions, it shows excellent stability. With this electrocatalyst as cathode material and bisphenol A containing KOH as electrolyte, Zn&#8208;air battery is assembled. When &#8220;charge&#8221; at 85 mA&#183;cm  &#8208;2  , it only requires 1.98 V. Peak power density of this Zn&#8208;air battery reaches 120.5 mW&#183;cm  &#8208;2  . More importantly, in &#8220;charge&#8221; process, bisphenol A is degraded, which achieves energy saving and pollutants removal simultaneously in one Zn&#8208;air battery.</dc:description>

         <title>Formulation of Next Generation Multi&#8208;Compartment Microcapsules by Reversible Electrostatic Attraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combination of several active substances in one carrier is often limited due to the solubility, stability and phase separation issues. These issues are addressed by an innovative capsule design, in which nanocapsules are assembled on the microcapsule surface by electrostatic forces forming a pH responsive hierarchical capsule@capsule system. Here, melamine&#8208;formaldehyde (MF) microcapsules with a negative surface charge were synthesized and coated with novel MF&#8208;polyethyleneimine (PEI) copolymer to achieve a positive charge of &#950; = + 28 mV. This novel coating procedure allows the electrostatic assembly of negatively charged poly&#8208;L&#8208;lactide (PLLA, &#950; = &#8208; 19 mV) and poly&#8208;(lactide&#8208;co&#8208;glycolide) (PLGA, &#950; = &#8208; 56 mV) nanocapsules on the microcapsule surface. Assembly studies at pH 7 gave a partial surface coverage of PLLA nanocapsules and full surface coverage for PLGA nanocapsules. The pH responsive adsorption and desorption of nanocapsules was shown at pH 7 and pH 3.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Preparation of CuCo2S4/Cu7.2S4 Nanocomposite s as High&#8208;performance C athode Materials for Rechargeable Magnesium Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) have been considered as a promising energy storage device due to their high energy density and high safety, but they still suffer from the lack of cathode with high&#8208;rate performance and cycle performance. Herein, CuCo  2  S  4  /Cu  7.2  S  4  composites with nano&#8208;sized were first synthesized by a facile solvothermal method in this work and the magnesium ion storage behaviour was discussed when applied in the cathode for RMBs. Electrochemical results demonstrated that the CuCo  2  S  4  /Cu  7.2  S  4  composites exhibit a high initial discharge capacity of 256 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 10 mA g  &#8208;1  and 123 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 300 mA g  &#8208;1  at room temperature and an outstanding long&#8208;term cyclic stability over 300 cycles at 300 mA g  &#8208;1  . Furthermore, the electrochemical storage mechanism demonstrated that the storage process of magnesium ion in the CuCo  2  S  4  /Cu  7.2  S  4  cathode is mainly driven by the strong pseudocapacitive effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving C&#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity of L&#8208;threonine Aldolase for Synthesis of L&#8208;threo&#8208;4&#8208;methylsulfonylphenylserine by Modulating Substrate&#8208;binding Pocket for Orientation Control of Substrate Entrance</title>

         <dc:description>L&#8208;threonine aldolase form Actinocorallia herbida (AhLTA) is an ideal catalyst for producing L&#8208;threo&#8208;4&#8208;methylsulfonylphenylserine [(2S, 3R)&#8208;1b], a key chiral precursor for florfenicol and thiamphenicol. The moderate C&#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity is the main obstacle for the industrial application of AhLTA. To address this issue, combinatorial active&#8208;site saturation test (CAST) joined with sequence&#160;conservatism&#160;analysis were applied to engineer the AhLTA toward improved C&#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity. The optical mutant Y314R could asymmetrically synthesize L&#8208;threo&#8208;4&#8208;methylsulfonylphenylserine with 81% de (diastereomeric excess), which is 23% higher than wild&#8208;type AhLTA. Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulations have revealed that the mechanism for C&#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity improvement of Y314R is due to the acylamino group of residues Arg314 controlling the orientation of substrate 4&#8208;methylsulphonyl benzaldehyde (1a) into the active pocket by directed interaction with the methylsulphonyl group, which leads to asymmetric synthesis of L&#8208;threo&#8208;4&#8208;methylsulfonylphenylserine. The success in the present study demonstrates that direct control of substrates into an active pocket is an attract strategy to address C&#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity problem of LTA, which contributes to the industrial application of LTA.</dc:description>

         <title>Large Scale Synthesis of Three&#8208;Dimensional Hierarchical Porous Framework with High Conductivity and its Application in Lithium Sulfur Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quick capacity loss due to the polysulfide shuttle effects and poor rate performance caused by low conductivity of sulfur have always been obstacles to the commercial application of lithium sulfur batteries. Herein, an in&#8208;situ doped hierarchical porous biochar materials with high electron&#8208;ion conductivity and adjustable three&#8208;dimensional (3D) macro&#8208;meso&#8208;micropore is prepared successfully. Due to its unique physical structure, the resulting material has a specific surface area of 2124.9 m  2  g  &#8208;1  and a cumulative pore volume of 1.19 cm  3  g  &#8208;1  . The presence of micropores can effectively physically adsorb polysulfides and mesopores ensure the accessibility of lithium ions and active sites, and give the porous carbon material a high specific surface area. The large pores provide channels for the storage of electrolyte and the transmission of ions on the surface of the substrate. The combined effect of these three kinds of pores and the N doping formed in&#8208;situ can effectively promote the cycle and rate performance of the battery. Therefore, prepared cathode can still reach a reversible discharge capacity of 616 mAh g  &#8208;1  at a rate of 5 C. After 400 charge&#8208;discharge cycles at 1 C, the reversible capacity is maintained at 510.0 mAh g  &#8208;1  . This new strategy has provided a new approach to the research and industrial&#8208;scale production of adjustable hierarchical porous biochar materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular sieving of acetylene from ethylene in a rigid ultramicroporous metal organic framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rigid molecular sieving materials are the ideal candidates for gas separation (e.g. C2H2/C2H4) due to their ultrahigh adsorption selectivity and absence of gas co&#8208;adsorption. However, the absolute molecular sieving effect for C2H2/C2H4 separation has rarely been realized because of their similar physicochemical properties. Herein, we demonstrate the absolute molecular sieving of C2H2 from C2H4 by a rigid ultramicroporous metal&#8211;organic framework (F&#8208;PYMO&#8208;Cu) with 1D regular channels (pore size of c.a. 3.4 &#197;). F&#8208;PYMO&#8208;Cu exhibited moderate acetylene uptake (35.5 cm3/ cm3), but very low ethylene uptake (0.55 cm3/ cm3) at 298 K and 1 bar, yielding the second highest C2H2/C2H4 uptake ratio of 63.6 up to now. One&#8208;step C2H4 production from the binary mixture of C2H2/C2H4 and the ternary mixture of C2H2/CO2/C2H4 at 298 K was achieved and verified by dynamic breakthrough experiments. Coupled with excellent thermal and water stability, F&#8208;PYMO&#8208;Cu could be a promising candidate for industry&#8208;related C2 separation tasks.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Enhancement of the luminescence efficiency of two new diazapentacenium salts (  D1  and  D2  ) of more than 55 for  D1  and 22 times for  D2  ) in poor solvents, acetonitrile and/or dichloromethane, was observed and rationalized as formation of emissive J&#8208;aggregates.

         <title>On the Structural Assignments Underlying R.&#8197;B. Woodward's Most Personal Data That Led to the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann Rules: Subramania Ranganathan's Key Role and Related Research by E.&#8197;J. Corey and A.&#8197;G. Hortmann</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In 1963 and early 1964, R. B. Woodward and his postdoctoral student Subramania Ranganathan discovered a route&#8208;ending glitch in the isoxazole route to vitamin B12. However, they simultaneously discovered two coupled pairs of stereospecific valence isomerizations that became Woodward's 5th mysterious reaction and led to the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann rules. This Essay discusses the behind&#8208;the&#8208;scenes story of Ranganathan's research and confirms his structure determinations using quantum chemical calculations of 1H&#8197;NMR parameters.







Abstract
In the early 1960s, as part of R. B. Woodward's isoxazole route to vitamin B12, Subramania Ranganathan uncovered two coupled sets of stereospecific reactions, a thermal set and a photochemical set. These four reactions illustrated the alternating configurations that were the major data points that prompted the solution of the no&#8208;mechanism problem. Though Ranganathan's reactions played a major role, according to Woodward, in the development of the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann rules, they were published only as part of the documentation of a lecture given by Woodward in 1966. The authors of this paper have uncovered Subramania Ranganathan's 1964 postdoctoral report and have used modern quantum chemical theory to predict the 1H&#8197;NMR spectra for Ranganathan's key compounds, providing support for the structure assignments made by Woodward and Ranganathan. A similar set of alternating, stereospecific reactions was observed by E.&#8197;J. Corey and Alfred Hortmann in their 1963 total synthesis of dihydrocostunolide. We also have applied the computational process used for Ranganathan's compounds to Hortmann's compounds, now also including the calculation of coupling constants, and find computational support for Corey and Hortmann's structure assignments.

     alt="On the Structural Assignments Underlying R.&#8197;B. Woodward's Most Personal Data That Led to the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann Rules: Subramania Ranganathan's Key Role and Related Research by E.&#8197;J. Corey and A.&#8197;G. Hortmann"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In 1963 and early 1964&lt;/b&gt;, R. B. Woodward and his postdoctoral student Subramania Ranganathan discovered a route&#8208;ending glitch in the isoxazole route to vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. However, they simultaneously discovered two coupled pairs of stereospecific valence isomerizations that became Woodward's 5th mysterious reaction and led to the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann rules. This Essay discusses the behind&#8208;the&#8208;scenes story of Ranganathan's research and confirms his structure determinations using quantum chemical calculations of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR parameters.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early 1960s, as part of R. B. Woodward's isoxazole route to vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, Subramania Ranganathan uncovered two coupled sets of stereospecific reactions, a thermal set and a photochemical set. These four reactions illustrated the alternating configurations that were the major data points that prompted the solution of the no&#8208;mechanism problem. Though Ranganathan's reactions played a major role, according to Woodward, in the development of the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann rules, they were published only as part of the documentation of a lecture given by Woodward in 1966. The authors of this paper have uncovered Subramania Ranganathan's 1964 postdoctoral report and have used modern quantum chemical theory to predict the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR spectra for Ranganathan's key compounds, providing support for the structure assignments made by Woodward and Ranganathan. A similar set of alternating, stereospecific reactions was observed by E.&#8197;J. Corey and Alfred Hortmann in their 1963 total synthesis of dihydrocostunolide. We also have applied the computational process used for Ranganathan's compounds to Hortmann's compounds, now also including the calculation of coupling constants, and find computational support for Corey and Hortmann's structure assignments.&lt;/p&gt;

         <dc:description>Fluorenyl cations are text book examples of 4&#960; electron antiaromatic five&#8208;membered ring systems. So far, they were reported only as short&#8208;lived intermediates generated under superacidic conditions or by flash photolysis. Our attempt to prepare a m&#8208;terphenyl acylium cation by fluoride abstraction from a benzoyl fluoride, gave rise to an isolable 9&#8208;hydroxy fluorenyl cation that formed by an intramolecular electrophilic attack at a flanking mesityl group prior to a 1,2&#8208;methyl shift and proton transfer to oxygen.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Desepoxy&#8208;Tedanolide C</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of one isomer of the marine natural product tedanolide C was accomplished and provides evidence about the relative configuration of this member of the tedanolide family. The synthesis takes advantage of a variant of the Kiyooka aldol protocol for the stereoselective synthesis of the tertiary alcohol flanked by three additional oxygenated carbon atoms. The synthesis was particularly sensitive to the appropriate selection of protecting groups, which made constant protecting group switches necessary. The spectroscopic data of the synthesized isomer support a different configuration than the originally proposed one.







Abstract
The synthesis of desepoxy&#8208;tedanolide C was accomplished and provided experimental evidence on the configuration of tedanolide C. The reported chemical shifts and coupling constants point to a configuration different from the published structure and analogous to the structures of the other members of this family of natural products. The key step is a Kiyooka aldol protocol for the stereoselective synthesis of the tertiary alcohol flanked by three additional oxygenated carbon atoms. Furthermore, two additional aldol reactions and a Julia&#8211;Kocienski olefination were used to assemble the carbon framework.

         <dc:description>
Chemical synthesis of a Kdo&#8208;containing rhamnogalacturonan II pentasaccharide was achieved by a [4+1] post&#8208;glycosylation oxidation approach.







Abstract
The synthesis of a fully deprotected Kdo&#8208;containing rhamnogalacturonan II pentasaccharide is described. The strategy relies on the preparation of a suitably protected homogalacturonan tetrasaccharide backbone, through a post&#8208;glycosylation oxidation approach, and its stereoselective glycosylation with a Kdo fluoride donor.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Afterglow organic nanoparticles (ONPs) with long lifetime and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission offered high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and good tissue penetration for afterglow imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) in vivo. Owing to strong afterglow fluorescence and abundant singlet oxygen generation from the ONPs upon NIR laser irradiation, they have shown effective suppression of tumor growth after imaging&#8208;guided PDT in mice with minimal damage to major organs.

         <title>A Cyclometalated IrIII Complex Conjugated to a Coumarin Derivative Is a Potent Photodynamic Agent against Prostate Differentiated and Tumorigenic Cancer Stem Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A cyclometalated IrIII complex conjugated to a far&#8208;red&#8208;emitting coumarin, IrIII&#8211;COUPY (3), was recently shown as a very promising photosensitizer suitable for photodynamic therapy of cancer. Conventional anticancer chemotherapies exhibit several disadvantages, such as limited efficiency to target cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are considered the main reason for chemotherapy resistance, relapse, and metastasis. Herein, we show, using DU145 tumor cells, taken as the model of hormone&#8208;refractory and aggressive prostate cancer cells resistant to conventional antineoplastic drugs, that the photoactivated 3 very efficiently eliminates both prostate bulk, differentiated and prostate, hardly treatable CSCs simultaneously and with a similar efficiency. Notably, the very low toxicity of IrIII&#8211;COUPY conjugate in the prostate DU145 cells in the dark and its pronounced selectivity for tumor cells compared with noncancerous cells could result in low side effects and reduced damage of healthy cells during the photoactivated therapy by this agent. Moreover, the experiments performed with the 3D spheroids formed from DU145 CSCs showed that conjugate 3 can penetrate the inner layers of tumorspheres, which might markedly increase its therapeutic effect. Notably, this conjugate induces apoptotic cell death in prostate cancer DU145 cells associated with calcium signaling flux in these cells and autophagy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that a photoactivatable metal&#8208;based compound is an efficient agent capable of killing even hardly treatable prostatic CSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Confinement Inside a Crystalline Sponge Induces Pyrrole to Form N&#8208;H&#8230;&#960; Bonded Tetramers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Based on the DFT&#8208;level calculated molecular volume (V  mol  ) of pyrrole and its liquid density, pyrrole manifests the highest liquid density coefficient LD  c  (defined as [V  mol  &#8226; density &#8226; 0.6023]/FW) value of 0.7. Normal liquids have LD  c  &lt; 0.63.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Based on the DFT&#8208;level calculated molecular volume (V  mol  ) of pyrrole and its liquid density, pyrrole manifests the highest liquid density coefficient LD  c  (defined as [V  mol  &#8226; density &#8226; 0.6023]/FW) value of 0.7. Normal liquids have LD  c  &amp;lt; 0.63.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A double helicene with a spiro&#8208;Si linker (  4  ) was synthesized by four successive nucleophilic substitutions on SiCl  4  . Its (  P,P  ), (  M,M  ) and (  P,M  ) isomers were isolated and characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Due to the central spirosilabi[fluorene] moiety, the two helicene units in  4  are symmetrically and nearly perpendicularly arranged. (  P,P  )&#8208;  4  and (  M,M  )&#8208;  4  exhibit unique optical properties attributable to the LUMO spiro&#8208;conjugation between the two sila[7]helicene units.</dc:description>

New visible&#8208;light&#8208;excitable solvatochromic fluorescent label for light&#8208;up and colour&#8208;change sensing of DNA&#8208;protein interactions.







Abstract
The synthesis of 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxycytidine and its 5&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;triphosphate bearing solvatochromic acetophenyl&#8208;thienyl&#8208;aniline fluorophore was developed using the Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction as the key step. The triphosphate was used for polymerase synthesis of labelled DNA. The labelled nucleotide or DNA exerted weak red fluorescence when excited at 405&#8197;nm, but a significant colour change (to yellow or green) and light&#8208;up (up to 20 times) was observed when the DNA probes interacted with proteins or lipids.

         <title>Uniform Nanowires Containing a Heterogeneous &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Core of Controlled Length, Composition and Morphology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate for the first time that heterojunction nanowires consisting of a gradient and segmented&#8208;like heterogeneous &#960;&#8208;conjugated core with controllable length, composition and morphology can be generated by co&#8208;self&#8208;seeding of oligo(  p  &#8208;phenylene vinylene) (OPV)&#8208; and oligo(  p  &#8208;phenylene ethynylene) (OPE)&#8208;containing block copolymers in despite of different chain lengths and molecular conformation for OPE and OPV. More importantly, on the basis of understanding about the formation of heterogeneous core by the co&#8208;self&#8208;seeding approach, we develop a &#8220;heating/cooling&#8221; seeded growth route, by which linear and branched heterojunction nanowires containing a segmented heterogeneous &#960;&#8208;conjugated core of controlled length, composition and morphology can be obtained. This work provides a versatile platform to generate heterojunction nanowires with excellent controllability in length, composition and morphology.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Nanoaggregates of Sialylated Biohybrid Photosensitizers for Intracellular Activation of the Photodynamic Response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the endeavor of extending the clinical use of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for the treatment of superficial cancers and other neoplastic diseases, deeper knowledge and control on the subcellular processes that determine the response of photosensitizers (PS) are needed. Recent strategies in this direction involve the use of activatable and nanostructured PS. Herein both capacities have been tuned in two dendritic zinc (II) phthalocyanine (ZnPc) derivatives, either asymmetrically or symmetrically substituted with 3 and 12 copies of the carbohydrate sialic acid (SA), respectively. Interestingly, the amphiphilic ZnPc&#8208;SA biohybrid (1) self&#8208;assembles into well&#8208;defined nanoaggregates in aqueous solution, facilitating cellular internalization and transport while the PS remains inactive. Within the cells, this nanostructured hybrid localizes in the lysosomes, as it usually happens for anionic and hydrophilic aggregated PS. Yet, in contrast to most of them (e.g., compound 2), hybrid 1 recovers the capacity for photoinduced ROS generation within the target organelles due to its amphiphilic character, which allows disruption of aggregation when it gets inserted into the lysosomal membrane, with the concomitant highly efficient PDT response.</dc:description>

         <title>Bis(Iminophosphorano)&#8208;Substituted Pyridinium Ions and their Corresponding Bispyridinylidene Organic Electron Donors**</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optimized synthetic procedures for pyridinium ions featuring iminophosphorano (&#8208;N=PR3  ; R = Ph, Cy) &#960;&#8208;donor substituents in the 2&#8208; and 4&#8208; positions are described. Crystallographic and theoretical studies reveal that the strongly donating substituents severely polarize the &#960;&#8208;electrons of the pyridyl ring at the expense of aromaticity. Moreover, the pyridinium ions are readily deprotonated to generate powerful bispyridinylidene (BPY) organic electron donors. Electrochemical studies show exceptionally low redox potentials for the two&#8208;electron BPY/BPY2+  couples, ranging from &#8208;1.71 V vs the saturated calomel electrode for  3PhPh  (with four Ph3P=N&#8208; groups) to &#8208;1.85 V for  3CyCy  (with four Cy3P=N&#8208; groups). These new compounds represent the most reducing neutral organic electron donors (OEDs) currently known. Some preliminary reductions involving  3CyCy  showed enhanced capability owing to its low redox potential, such as the thermally activated reduction of an aryl chloride, but purification challenges were often encountered.</dc:description>

         <title>The Unusual Photochromic and Hydrochromic Switching Behavior of Cellulose&#8208;Embedded 1,8&#8208;Naphthalimide&#8208;Viologen Derivatives in the Solid&#8208;State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive chromic materials such as photochromes, hydrochromes, thermochromes, and electrochromes have a long history of capturing the attention of scientists due to their potential industrial applications and novelty in popular culture. However, hybrid chromic materials that combine two or more stimuli&#8208;triggered color changing properties are not so well known. Herein, we report a design strategy that has led to a series of emissive 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide&#8208;viologen dyads which exhibit unusual dual photochromic and hydrochromic switching behavior in the solid&#8208;state when embedded in a cellulose matrix.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stimuli&#8208;responsive chromic materials such as photochromes, hydrochromes, thermochromes, and electrochromes have a long history of capturing the attention of scientists due to their potential industrial applications and novelty in popular culture. However, hybrid chromic materials that combine two or more stimuli&#8208;triggered color changing properties are not so well known. Herein, we report a design strategy that has led to a series of emissive 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide&#8208;viologen dyads which exhibit unusual dual photochromic and hydrochromic switching behavior in the solid&#8208;state when embedded in a cellulose matrix. This behavior manifests as reversible solid state fluorescence hydrochromism upon changes in relative humidity&#160;and reversible solid state photochromism upon generation of a cellulose&#8208;stabilized viologen radical cation. In this design strategy, the bipyridinium unit serves as a water&#8208;sensitive receptor for the hydrochromic fluorophore&#8208;receptor system, and a photochromic group&#160;capable of eliciting its own visible colorimetric response, generating an emission quenching radical cation with exposure to UV&#160;light.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A modified synthetic pathway towards perylene&#8208;perylene&#8208;dimers and a facile purification method to obtain the regioisomerically pure  syn  &#8208; and  anti  &#8208;isomers are reported. In addition, a novel perylene&#8208;naphthalene heterodimer with 30 conjugated  &#960;  &#8208;electron pairs was designed and synthesized on the basis of a previously described precursor and the resulting regioisomers were separated from each other. Thereby, the opto&#8208;electronic properties of the linearly elongated chromophores could be investigated regarding the differences in length of their aromatic system and the configuration of the isomers. Further tuning of their energy gaps was realized  via  protonation and methylation of the dibenzimidazole&#8208;bridging unit. Extraordinary red&#8208;shifts of the absorption maxima of 62 nm for the methylated and 92 nm for the protonated perylene&#8208;perylene  anti  &#8208;isomer could be achieved. Moreover, the maxima for the  syn  &#8208;isomer could be shifted bathochromically by 87 and 113 nm, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free &#945; Csp3&#8722;H Cyanation of Sulfonamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flash chromatography column free and transition metal free cyanation of &#945; C&#8722;H sulfonylamide was developed to access valuable &#945;&#8208;amino cyanation products from a variety of fluorine masked sulfonylamides. Compared with Strecker reaction, this transformation offers a complementary strategy to efficiently construct &#945;&#8208;amino cyanides from direct &#945; C&#8722;H functionalization of sulfonylamindes. The reaction has a broad substrate scope and occurs under mild conditions. More importantly, the new two&#8208;electron allows for excellent &#945; site&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
This report describes the site&#8208;selective &#945;&#8208;functionalization of sulfonylamide derivatives through the in&#8208;situ generation of imine intermediates. The N&#8722;F sulfonylamides, which could facilitate the elimination to generate imines, are coupled with TBACN to efficiently and mildly afford &#945;&#8208;amino cyanides. Comparing with Strecker reaction, this transformation offers a complementary strategy to efficiently construct &#945;&#8208;amino cyanides from direct &#945; C&#8722;H functionalization of sulfonylamindes. The reaction is also characterized by broad substrate scope and flash chromatography column free workup. More importantly, the new two&#8208;electron pathway to generate imines through manipulation of the leaving group allows us to achieve excellent &#945; site&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Rhodium Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of Highly Fluorescent and CPL Active Dispiroindeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enantioselective synthesis of chiral [7]&#8208;helical dispirodihydro[2,1&#8208;c]indenofluorenes (DSF&#8208;IFs) was achieved for the first time in good yields with high e.r. values (e.r. up to 99:1). The crucial step of the whole reaction sequence was enantioselective intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of tethered triynediols to indenofluorenediols that was catalyzed by a Rh/SEGPHOS  &#174;  complex. Further transformations lead to the corresponding DSF&#8208;IFs. The prepared helically chiral DSF&#8208;IFs combine circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity (  g  lum  = ~10  &#8208;3  ) with exceptionally high fluorescence quantum yields (up to &#934;  lum  = 0.97).</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic Approach&#160;to Multi&#8208;Layer 3D Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first asymmetric catalytic approach to multi&#8208;layer 3D chirality has been achieved via Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings. New chiral catalysts were designed and screened under various catalytic systems that proved chiral amide&#8208;phosphines to be more efficient ligands than other candidates. The multi&#8208;layer 3D framework was unambiguously determined by X&#8208;ray structural analysis showing a parallel pattern of three layers consisting top, middle and bottom aromatic rings. X&#8208;ray structure of a catalyst complex, dichloride complex of Pd&#8208;phosphine amide, was obtained revealing an interesting asymmetric environment nearby Pd metal center. Three rings of multi&#8208;layer 3D products can be readily changed by varying aromatic ring&#8208;anchored starting materials. The resulting multi&#8208;layer products displayed strong luminescence under UV irradiation and strong aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE). This work would benefit not only asymmetric chemistry but also materials science, particularly, polarized organic electronics, optoelectrics and photovoltaics in future.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis and characterization of a polyrotaxanated covalent&#8208;organic network (CON) based on the association between the viologen and pillar[5]arene (P[5]OH) units is reported.

         <title>Crystallization Induced Self&#8208;Assembly: A Strategy to Achieve Ultra&#8208;Small&#160;Domain Size</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving self&#8208;assembled nanostructures with ultra&#8208;small feature sizes (e.g., below 5 nm) is an important prerequisite for the development of block copolymer lithography. Herein, we present the preparation and self&#8208;assembly of a series of giant molecules composed of vinyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (VPOSS) tethered with monodispersed oligo(L&#8208;lactide) chains. Small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results demonstrate that ultra&#8208;small domain sizes (down to 3 nm) of phase separated lamellar morphology are achieved in bulk, driven by the strong tendency and fast crystallization of VPOSS moieties. Moreover, upon gamma ray radiation, VPOSS cages in the lamellar structure can be crosslinked via polymerization of the vinyl groups. After pyrolysis at high temperature, ultra&#8208;thin two&#8208;dimensional nano&#8208;silica sheets can be obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>Diindenopyrazines: Electron&#8208;Deficient Arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the syntheses, properties and application of air stable, electron acceptors, the diindenopyrazines  4a&#8208;g  . We demonstrate introduction of functional aryl groups in 6,12&#8208;position. The targets are accessible on the hundred milligrams to the gram scale. The structure of the aryl groups in  4a&#8208;g  modulate the solubility, redox potentials and optical properties. Introduction of electron poor aryl groups to the electron poor diindenopyrazine backbone reduces the electron affinity to &#8209;4&#160;eV, attractive as n&#8209;semiconductors. A simple organic field&#8208;effect transistor &#8208; without optimization &#8208; of  4e  shows electron transport with a mobility of up to 0.037 cm  2  /Vs.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Foaming Metal&#8208;Organic Gels Based on Phytic Acid and Their Mechanical, Moldable and Load&#8208;Bearing Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A catalogue of metal&#8208;organic gels are synthesized from phytic acid (PA) and a diversity of metal ions (Fe  3+  , Cr  3+  , Al  3+  , Ce  3+  , Y  3+  , Co  2+  , Ni  2+  , Mn  2+  , Cu  2+  , Zn  2+  , Mg  2+  ) upon heating at 80  o  C. PA&#8208;M gels have various morphologies, including irregular granular (PA&#8208;Fe, PA&#8208;Al, PA&#8208;Ce, PA&#8208;Cr, PA&#8208;Ni, PA&#8208;Co), spongy (PA&#8208;Y), and hollow tremella&#8208;like (PA&#8208;Cu) morphologies. Interestingly for PA&#8208;Fe&#8208;1:4 (PA:Fe  3+  = 1:4) a large amount of gas is generated during the gelation process leading to a self&#8208;foaming gel. The PA&#8208;Fe&#8208;1:4 self&#8208;foaming gel shows reversible gel&#8208;sol phase transition. The gel is unusually weankened and transformed into a sol at room temperature, and the sol is reversed to gelation when heated again at 80  o  C. PA&#8208;Fe&#8208;1:4 gel also shows shapeable and load&#8208;bearing properties, and it can bear up to 200 times of its weight, depending on the gas amount fixed in the foam gel and the aging time. This work provides a catalogue of self&#8208;foaming supramolecular gels with tuneable properties based on naturally abundant resources.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Heteroleptic Dicoordinate Cu(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work we detail our efforts to systematically generate stable dicoordinate Cu(II) complexes. Initial experiments via metathesis reactions of a bulky potassium carbazolide (RK) with copper(II) salts indeed yielded a stable product, RCuOTf (  1  ). However, subsequent attempts to grasp systematic synthetic access to complexes of the type RCuX (X = monoanionic ligand) proved difficult as many of the complexes rapidly decomposed in solution. By using triflate&#8208;related ligands such as ethyl sulfate and bistriflimide, the additional dicoordinate copper complexes RCuOSO  3  Et (  2  ), [RCu(THF)][Cu(NTf  2  )  2  ] (  3  ) and RCuNTf  2  (  4  ) could be isolated.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this work we detail our efforts to systematically generate stable dicoordinate Cu(II) complexes. Initial experiments via metathesis reactions of a bulky potassium carbazolide (RK) with copper(II) salts indeed yielded a stable product, RCuOTf (  1  ). However, subsequent attempts to grasp systematic synthetic access to complexes of the type RCuX (X = monoanionic ligand) proved difficult as many of the complexes rapidly decomposed in solution. By using triflate&#8208;related ligands such as ethyl sulfate and bistriflimide, the additional dicoordinate copper complexes RCuOSO  3  Et (  2  ), [RCu(THF)][Cu(NTf  2  )  2  ] (  3  ) and RCuNTf  2  (  4  ) could be isolated.

         <title>Simple Amides and Amines for the Synergistic Recovery of Rhodium from Hydrochloric Acid by Solvent Extraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The separation and isolation of many of the platinum group metals (PGMs) is currently achieved commercially using solvent extraction processes. The extraction of rhodium is problematic however, as a variety of complexes of the form [RhCln(H2O)6&#8208;n ](n&#8208;3)&#8722; are found in hydrochloric acid, making it difficult to design a reagent that can extract all the rhodium. In this work, the synergistic combination of a primary amine (2&#8208;ethylhexylamine, LA) with a primary amide (3,5,5&#8208;trimethylhexanamide, L1) is shown to extract over 85 % of rhodium from 4 M hydrochloric acid.&#160; Two rhodium complexes are shown to reside in the organic phase, the ion&#8208;pair [HLA]3[RhCl6] and the amide complex [HLA]2[RhCl5(L1)]; in the latter complex, the amide is tautomerized to its enol form and coordinated to the rhodium centre through the nitrogen atom. This insight highlights the need for ligands that target specific metal complexes in the aqueous phase and provides an efficient synergistic solution for the solvent extraction of rhodium.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>As a consequence of the static Jahn&#8208;Teller effect of the&#160;  5  E ground state of Mn(III) in cubic structures with octahedral parent geometries, their octahedral coordination spheres become distorted.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Virtually inert sulfur hexafluoride becomes a precious pentafluorosulfanylation agent, if properly activated by photoredox catalysis, to access &#945;&#8208;fluoro and &#945;&#8208;alkoxy SF  5  &#8208;compounds. This advanced protocol converts SF  6  in the presence of alkynols as bifunctional C&#8208;C&#8208; and C&#8208;O&#8208;bond forming reagents directly into pentafluorosulfanylated oxygen&#8208;containing heterocycles in a single step from &#945;&#8208;substituted alkenes. The proposed mechanism is supported by theoretical calculations and gives insights not only in the pentafluorosulfanylation step but also into formation of the carbon&#8208;carbon bond and is in full agreement with Baldwin&#8217;s cyclization rules. The key step is a radical type 5&#8208;, 6&#8208; respectively 7&#8208;exo&#8208;dig&#8208;cyclization.

         <title>Racemic Tartrate/Malate Anions Combine with Racemic Complex Cations to Form Optically Active Ionic Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spontaneous resolution has attracted continuing attention in various research fields since Pasteur&#8217;s work on the crystallization behavior of racemic tartrate. Here, we report a unique example of this phenomenon involving ionic crystals generated from racemic  RR/SS&#8208;tartrate or  R/S&#8208;malate and racemic &#916;&#916;/&#923;&#923;&#8208;[Ag3Rh2(2&#8208;aminoethanethiolato)6]3+  (&#916;&#916;/&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1]3+) in water. We found that  RR&#8208; and  SS&#8208;tartrate selectively recognize the &#923;&#923; and &#916;&#916;&#160;isomers of [1]3+  to produce ionic crystals of (&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1])2(RR&#8208;tartrate)3  and (&#916;&#916;&#8208;[1])2(SS&#8208;tartrate)3  , respectively, which can undergo spontaneous resolution. While spontaneous resolution also occurs when using  R/S&#8208;malate,  R&#8208; and  S&#8208;malate select the opposite isomers of [1]3+  to give ionic crystals of (&#916;&#916;&#8208;[1])2(R&#8208;malate)3  and (&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1])2(S&#8208;malate)3  , respectively. In the presence of  S&#8208;  aspartate, (&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1])2(R&#8208;tartrate)3  and (&#916;&#916;&#8208;[1])2(S&#8208;tartrate)3  are preferentially crystallized from &#916;&#916;/&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1]3+  and  RR/SS&#8208;tartrate at solution pH values of 6 and 10, respectively.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous resolution has attracted continuing attention in various research fields since Pasteur&#8217;s work on the crystallization behavior of racemic tartrate.

         <title>Structural insights into the molecular recognition mechanism of the cancer and pathogenic epitope, LacdiNAc by immune&#8208;related lectins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interactions of glycan&#8208;specific epitopes to human lectin receptors represent novel immune checkpoints for investigating cancer and infection diseases. By employing a multidisciplinary approach that combines isothermal titration calorimetry, NMR spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and X&#8208;ray crystallography, we disclosed the molecular determinants that govern the recognition of the tumour and pathogenic glycobiomarker LacdiNAc (GalNAc&#946;1&#8208;4GlcNAc, LDN), including their comparison with the ubiquitous LacNAc epitope (Gal&#946;1&#8208;4GlcNAc, LN), by two human immune&#8208;related lectins, galectin&#8208;3 (hGal&#8208;3) and the macrophage galactose C&#8208;type lectin (hMGL). A different mechanism of binding and interactions is observed for the hGal&#8208;3/LDN and hMGL/LDN complexes, which explains the remarkable difference in the binding specificity of LDN and LN by these two lectins. The new structural clues reported herein are fundamental for the chemical design of mimetics targeting hGal&#8208;3/hMGL recognition process.</dc:description>

         <title>Pentafluorophenyl esters as exchangeable stoppers for the&#160;construction of photoactive [2]rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stable pillar[5]arene&#8208;containing [2]rotaxane building blocks with pentafluorophenyl ester stoppers have been efficiently prepared on a multi&#8208;gram scale. Reaction of these building blocks with various nucleophiles gave access to a wide range of [2]rotaxanes with amide, ester or thioester stoppers in good to excellent yields. The rotaxane structure is fully preserved during these chemical transformations. Actually, the addition&#8208;elimination mechanism at work during these transformations totally prevents the unthreading of the axle moiety of the mechanically interlocked system. The stopper exchange reactions were optimized both in solution and under mechanochemical solvent&#8208;free conditions. While amide formation is more efficient in solution, the solvent&#8208;free conditions are more powerful for the transesterification reactions. Starting from a fullerene&#8208;functionalized pillar[5]arene derivative, this new strategy gave easy access to a photoactive [2]rotaxane incorporating a C  60  &#160;moiety and two Bodipy stoppers. Despite the absence of covalent connectivity between the Bodipy and the fullerene moieties in this photoactive molecular device, efficient through space excited state interactions have been evidenced in this rotaxane.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Visible&#8208;Light Synthesis of Arylsulfonyl Fluorides: Scope and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first metal&#8208;free procedure for the synthesis of arylsulfonyl fluorides is reported. Under organophotoredox conditions, aryl diazonium salts reacts with readily available SO 2 source (DABSO) to afford the desired product via simple nucleophilic fluorination. The reaction scope tolerates the presence of both electron&#8208;rich and &#8208;poor aryls and demonstrated a broad functional group tolerance. To shed the light on the reaction mechanism, several experimental techniques have been combined including fluorescence, NMR, EPR spectroscopy as well as DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;fused porphyrin (NFP) is a unique class of photostable near&#8208;infrared dyes with an 18&#960; aromatic tetrapyrrole macrocyclic skeleton containing a tri&#8208;fused pentacyclic moiety. Here we report the synthesis of an iridium complex of N&#8208;fused bilatrienone as the degradation product of Ir&#8211;cyclooctadiene (cod)&#8208;induced oxidative cleavage of NFP under aerobic conditions. Similar to the native bilin chromophores, the ring&#8208;opened complex featured a broken &#960;&#8208;conjugation circuit and exhibited a broad visible absorption band. In contrast, metalation of NFP using an iridium(I)(cod) complex under an inert atmosphere resulted in the formation of a cod&#8208;isomerized ( &#954; 1 , &#951; 3 &#8208;C 8 H 12 )&#8211;Ir complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Zinc&#8208; and Cadmium meso&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Isoporphyrins: Non&#8208;Aromatic NIR Dyes with Distinct Conformational Features</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of pyrrolyl and dipyrrinyl isoporphyrins carrying different phenyl and thienyl groups is reported. The compounds are obtained by a one&#8208;pot approach in the presence of a template reagent. Thienyl derivatives gave better yields, and were the only subclass to form with sterical hindrance. The structural analyses carried out on compounds  1  and  14  revealed distinct conformational differences which are likely to result from an intramolecular NH  &#8230;  Cl hydrogen bridge of the pyrrolyl subclass. In addition, this hydrogen bridge strongly favours one of the two possible atropisomers. Hindered rotation of the  meso  &#8208;aryl groups is observed only in the cases of methylbenzothienyl derivatives  10  and  15  and leads to the observation of several diastereomers. NIR absorptions up to 923 nm are found throughout. Electrochemical investigations into the 1e  &#8208;  and 2e  &#8208;  reduced species unravel axial ligand exchange dynamics for the zinc isoporphyrin radical, and the probable formation of a zinc phlorinate.</dc:description>

         <title>Surprising Homolytic Gas Phase Co&#8722;C Bond Dissociation Energies of Organometallic Aryl&#8208;Cobinamides Reveal Notable Non&#8208;Bonded Intramolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crucial resistance of aryl&#8208;cobalamins, as antivitamins B12, against metabolic conversion into B12 cofactors has been traced to their presumed strong organometallic bond. The strength of the Co&#8722;C bond of aryl&#8208;cobinamides was examined here by ESI&#8208;MS threshold collision&#8208;induced dissociation (CID) experiments. Surprisingly, the Co&#8722;C
 bonds of these aryl&#8208;corrins were less strong than the Co&#8722;C
 bond in their methyl analogue, revealing the relevance of non&#8208;bonded interactions.







Abstract
Aryl&#8208;cobalamins are a new class of organometallic structural mimics of vitamin B12 designed as potential &#8216;antivitamins B12&#8217;. Here, the first cationic aryl&#8208;cobinamides are described, which were synthesized using the newly developed diaryl&#8208;iodonium method. The aryl&#8208;cobinamides were obtained as pairs of organometallic coordination isomers, the stereo&#8208;structure of which was unambiguously assigned based on homo&#8208; and heteronuclear NMR spectra. The availability of isomers with axial attachment of the aryl group, either at the &#8216;beta&#8217; or at the &#8216;alpha&#8217; face of the cobalt&#8208;center allowed for an unprecedented comparison of the organometallic reactivity of such pairs. The homolytic gas&#8208;phase bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of the coordination&#8208;isomeric phenyl&#8208; and 4&#8208;ethylphenyl&#8208;cobinamides were determined by ESI&#8208;MS threshold CID experiments, furnishing (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDEs of 38.4 and 40.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively, for the two &#946;&#8208;isomers, and the larger BDEs of 46.6 and 43.8&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for the corresponding &#945;&#8208;isomers. Surprisingly, the observed (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDEs of the Co&#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;cobinamides were smaller than the (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDE of Co&#946;&#8208;methyl&#8208;cobinamide. DFT studies and the magnitudes of the experimental (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDEs revealed relevant contributions of non&#8208;bonded interactions in aryl&#8208;cobinamides, notably steric strain between the aryl and the cobalt&#8208;corrin moieties and non&#8208;bonded interactions with and among the peripheral sidechains.

         <title>Mononuclear Dysprosium Alkoxide and Aryloxide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mononuclear lanthanide single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) have progressively evolved in recent years. Lanthanide alkoxide and aryloxide chemistry offers a modular design approach to study the relaxation dynamics of high&#8208;performing SMMs. Alkoxide and aryloxide ligands on a single axis at a DyIII ion enhances the magnetic anisotropy and the barrier to magnetic reversal (Ueff). Leading examples of DyIII alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs are discussed in this review.







Abstract
Recent studies have shown that mononuclear lanthanide (Ln) complexes can be high&#8208;performing single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). Recently, there has been an influx of mononuclear Ln alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs, which have provided the necessary geometrical control to improve SMM properties and to allow the intricate relaxation dynamics of Ln SMMs to be studied in detail. Here non&#8208;aqueous Ln alkoxide and aryloxide chemistry applied to the synthesis of low&#8208;coordinate mononuclear Ln SMMs are reviewed. The focus is on mononuclear DyIII alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs with coordination numbers up to eight, covering synthesis, solid&#8208;state structures and magnetic attributes. Brief overviews are also provided of mononuclear TbIII, HoIII, ErIII and YbIII alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs.

         <title>Synthesis of Glycodendrimers with Antiviral and Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sticky scaffolds: The state of the art in the design and synthesis of glycodendrimers for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against bacterial and viral infections is described.







Abstract
Glycodendrimers are an important class of synthetic macromolecules that can be used to mimic many structural and functional features of cell&#8208;surface glycoconjugates. Their carbohydrate moieties perform key important functions in bacterial and viral infections, often regulated by carbohydrate&#8211;protein interactions. Several studies have shown that the molecular structure, valency and spatial organisation of carbohydrate epitopes in glycoconjugates are key factors in the specificity and avidity of carbohydrate&#8211;protein interactions. Choosing the right glycodendrimers almost always helps to interfere with such interactions and blocks bacterial or viral adhesion and entry into host cells as an effective strategy to inhibit bacterial or viral infections. Herein, the state of the art in the design and synthesis of glycodendrimers employed for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against bacterial and viral infections is described.

Golden carbene emitter systems: N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes that efficiently emit in the sky&#8208;blue to green part of the electromagnetic spectrum are reported. A first example of a solution&#8208;processable organic light&#8208;emitting device has been realized for this class of gold(III) complexes, revealing unique opportunities presented by these highly efficient gold(III) carbene emitter systems.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) cyclometalated gold(III) complexes remain very scarce and therefore their photophysical properties remain currently underexplored. Moreover, gold(III) complexes emitting in the blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum are rare. In this work, a series of four phosphorescent gold(III) complexes was investigated bearing four different NHC monocyclometalated (C^C*)&#8208;type ligands and a dianionic (N^N)&#8208;type ancillary ligand ((N^N)=5,5&#8217;&#8208;(propane&#8208;2,2&#8208;diyl)bis(3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1&#8201;H&#8208;pyrazole) (mepzH2)). The complexes exhibit strong phosphorescence when doped in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) at room temperature, which were systematically tuned from sky&#8208;blue [&#955;PL=456&#8197;nm, CIE coordinates: (0.20, 034)] to green [&#955;PL=516&#8197;nm, CIE coordinates: (0.31, 0.54)] by varying the monocyclometalated (C^C*) ligand framework. The complexes revealed high quantum efficiencies (&#981;PL) of up to 43&#8201;% and excited&#8208;state lifetimes (&#964;0) between 15&#8211;266&#8197;&#956;s. The radiative rate constant values found for these complexes (kr=103&#8211;104&#8197;s&#8722;1) are the highest found in comparison to previously known best&#8208;performing monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes. Density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations of these complexes further lend support to the excited&#8208;state nature of these complexes. The calculations showed a significant contribution of the gold(III) metal center in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of up to 18&#8201;%, which was found to be unique for this class of cyclometalated gold(III) complexes. Additionally, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) were fabricated by using a solution process to provide the first insight into the electroluminescent (EL) properties of this new class of gold(III) complexes.

         <title>Co&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Intramolecular [3+2] Cycloaddition of Yne&#8208;Alkylidenecyclopropanes and its Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Co&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric intramolecular [3+2] reaction of yne&#8208;alkylidenecyclopropanes (yne&#8208;ACPs) using a commercially available ligand has been realized for the synthesis of 5/5 and 6/5 bicycles. This reaction avoids the use of precious Pd and Rh catalysts usually used for these reactions. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction takes places via oxidative cyclometallation of the alkyne and the ACP, ring opening of the cyclopropyl group, and reductive elimination.







Abstract
Developing new transition metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cycloadditions for the synthesis of five&#8208;membered carbocycles (FMCs) is a research frontier in reaction development due to the ubiquitous presence of chiral FMCs in various functional molecules. Reported here is our discovery of a highly enantioselective intramolecular [3+2] cycloaddition of yne&#8208;alkylidenecyclopropanes (yne&#8208;ACPs) to bicyclo[3.3.0]octadiene and bicyclo[4.3.0]nonadiene molecules using a cheap Co catalyst and commercially available chiral ligand (S)&#8208;Xyl&#8208;BINAP. This reaction avoids the use of precious Pd and Rh catalysts, which are usually the choices for [3+2] reactions with ACPs. The enantiomeric excess in the present reaction can be up to 92&#8201;%. Cationic cobalt(I) species was suggested by experiments as the catalytic species. DFT calculations showed that this [3+2] reaction starts with oxidative cyclometallation of alkyne and ACP, followed by ring opening of the cyclopropyl (CP) group and reductive elimination to form the cycloadduct. This mechanism is different from previous [3+2] reactions of ACPs, which usually start from CP cleavage, not from oxidative cyclization.

N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes: Highly efficient photoluminescence was achieved in the sky&#8208;blue to green part of the electromagnetic spectrum using strong s&#8208;donating cyclometalated NHC ligands and a dianionic (N&#8201;N)&#8208;type bidentate as the ancillary ligand. Detailed photophysical investigations supported by density functional theory calculations provide insights into the excited&#8208;state properties of this new class of emitter molecules. The realization of the first solution&#8208;processable OLED device based on these strongly luminescent gold(III) carbene emitter systems opens up exciting new opportunities in light emitting applications.

         <title>Temperature Dependence of 1H Paramagnetic Chemical Shifts in Actinide Complexes, Beyond Bleaney's Theory: The AnVIO22+&#8211;Dipicolinic Acid Complexes (An=Np, Pu) as an Example</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NMR spectroscopy: The temperature dependence of paramagnetic 1H NMR chemical shifts are measured and modelled in the AnVIO22+&#8211;dipicolinic acid complexes. Only the pseudocontact term is non&#8208;zero. The magnetic susceptibility tensor, the energy states and magnetic moments of the paramagnetic center are deduced and compared to the SO&#8208;CASPT2 values.







Abstract
Actinide +VI complexes (
=
, 
 and 
) with dipicolinic acid derivatives were synthesized and characterized by powder XRD, SQUID magnetometry and NMR spectroscopy. In addition, 
 and 
 complexes were described by first principles CAS based and two&#8208;component spin&#8208;restricted DFT methods. The analysis of the 1H paramagnetic NMR chemical shifts for all protons of the ligands according to the X&#8208;rays structures shows that the Fermi contact contribution is negligible in agreement with spin density determined by unrestricted DFT. The magnetic susceptibility tensor is determined by combining SQUID, pNMR shifts and Evans&#8217; method. The SO&#8208;RASPT2 results fit well the experimental magnetic susceptibility and pNMR chemical shifts. The role of the counterions in the solid phase is pointed out; their presence impacts the magnetic properties of the 
 complex. The temperature dependence of the pNMR chemical shifts has a strong 
 contribution, contrarily to Bleaney's theory for lanthanide complexes. The fitting of the temperature dependence of the pNMR chemical shifts and SQUID magnetic susceptibility by a two&#8208;Kramers&#8208;doublet model for the 
 complex and a non&#8208;Kramers&#8208;doublet model for the 
 complex allows for the experimental evaluation of energy gaps and magnetic moments of the paramagnetic center.

         <title>Unveiling Luminescent IrI and RhI N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complexes: Structure, Photophysical Specifics, and Cellular Localization in the Endoplasmic Reticulum</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anticancer NHC complexes: RhI and IrI N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes provide an auspicious class of potential new anticancer agents; however, cellular imaging with luminescent derivatives of these complex types is often hampered by luminescence quenching. Building on an analysis of the parameters for metal&#8208;induced quenching processes, new examples of this complex class are designed with properties suitable for cellular imaging. Their main localization in the endoplasmic reticulum is not only an unprecedented finding but also represents the first ever insight into the cellular localization of Ir(NHC) complexes in the oxidation state +I.

Complexes of RhI and IrI of the [M(COD)(NHC)X] type (where M=Rh or Ir, COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene, NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, and X=halide) have recently shown promising cytotoxic activities against several cancer cell lines. Initial mechanism of action studies provided some knowledge about their interaction with DNA and proteins. However, information about their cellular localization remains scarce owing to luminescence quenching within this complex type. Herein, the synthesis of two rare examples of luminescent RhI and IrI [M(COD)(NHC)I] complexes with 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide&#8208;based emitting ligands is reported. All new complexes are comprehensively characterized, including with single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures. Steric crowding in one derivative leads to two distinct rotamers in solution, which apparently can be distinguished both by pronounced NMR shifts and by their respective spectral and temporal emission signatures. When the photophysical properties of these new complexes are exploited for cellular imaging in HT&#8208;29 and PT&#8208;45 cancer cell lines, it is demonstrated that the complexes accumulate predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is an entirely new finding and provides the first insight into the cellular localization of such IrI(NHC) complexes.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anticancer NHC complexes&lt;/b&gt;: Rh&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; and Ir&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes provide an auspicious class of potential new anticancer agents; however, cellular imaging with luminescent derivatives of these complex types is often hampered by luminescence quenching. Building on an analysis of the parameters for metal&#8208;induced quenching processes, new examples of this complex class are designed with properties suitable for cellular imaging. Their main localization in the endoplasmic reticulum is not only an unprecedented finding but also represents the first ever insight into the cellular localization of Ir(NHC) complexes in the oxidation state +I.

         <title>Directed Assembly of Multi&#8208;Walled Nanotubes and Nanoribbons of Amino Acid Amphiphiles Using a Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;walled nanotubes and nanoribbons of amino acid amphiphiles are fabricated by using a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer technique, where successive rigid amphiphile layers are glued together by oppositely charged polyelectrolyte. The resulting well&#8208;defined 1D structures are attractive as potential biocompatible delivery systems and building blocks in nanotechnology.







Abstract
Monodisperse unilamellar nanotubes (NTs) and nanoribbons (NRs) were transformed to multilamellar NRs and NTs in a well&#8208;defined fashion. This was done by using a step&#8208;wise approach in which self&#8208;assembled cationic amino acid amphiphile (AAA) formed the initial NTs or NRs, and added polyanion produced an intermediate coating. Successive addition of cationic AAA formed a covering AAA layer, and by repeating this layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) procedure, multi&#8208;walled nanotubes (mwNTs) and nanoribbons were formed. This process was structurally investigated by combining small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) and cryogenic&#8208;transmission electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;TEM), confirming the multilamellar structure and the precise layer spacing. In this way the controlled formation of multi&#8208;walled suprastructures was demonstrated in a simple and reproducible fashion, which allowed to control the charge on the surface of these 1D aggregates. This pathway to 1D colloidal materials is interesting for applications in life science and creating well&#8208;defined building blocks in nanotechnology.

         <title>Additive&#8208;free Aqueous Dispersions of Two&#8208;Dimensional Materials with Glial Cell Compatibility and Enzymatic Degradability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioelectronics: Processing of additive&#8208;free aqueous dispersions of 2D materials like transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride is demonstrated, and biological implications like cell compatibility and enzymatic degradability are investigated.







Abstract
Water&#8208;dispersible two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials are desirable for diverse applications. Aqueous dispersions make processing safer and greener and enable evaluation of these materials on biological and environmental fronts. To evaluate the effects of 2D materials with biological systems, obtaining dispersions without additives is critical and has been a challenge. Herein, a method was developed for obtaining additive&#8208;free aqueous dispersions of 2D materials like transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN). The nanosheet dispersions were investigated through spectroscopic and microscopic methods, along with the role of size on stability. The aqueous media enabled investigations on cytocompatibility and enzymatic degradation of molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) and h&#8208;BN. Cytocompatibility with mixed glial cells was observed up to concentrations of 100&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1, suggesting their plausible usage in bioelectronics. Besides, biodegradation using human myeloperoxidase (hMPO) mediated catalysis was investigated through Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy. The findings suggested that additive&#8208;free 2H&#8208;MoS2 and h&#8208;BN were degradable by hMPO, with 2H&#8208;phase exhibiting better resistance to degradation than the 1T&#8208;phase, while h&#8208;BN exhibited slower degradation. The findings pave a path for incorporating 2D materials in the burgeoning field of transient bioelectronics.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Investigation of the Structural and Opto&#8208;electronic Properties of Fe&#8208;Doped Lead&#8208;Free Cs2AgBiCl6 Double Perovskite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doubling up: The synthesis and first&#8208;principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations of Fe&#8208;doped, lead&#8208;free dipyramidal shape Cs2AgBiCl6 crystals for photodetector applications are presented. The results of systematic investigation of the crystal structure, morphology, optical properties, band structure, and stability of these materials are discussed.







Abstract
Lead&#8208;free double perovskites have emerged as stable and non&#8208;toxic alternatives to Pb&#8208;halide perovskites. Herein, the synthesis of Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 lead&#8208;free double perovskites are reported that display blue emission using an antisolvent method. The crystal structure, morphology, optical properties, band structure, and stability of the Fe&#8208;doped double perovskites were investigated systematically. Formation of the Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite is confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. XRD and thermo&#8208;gravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that the Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite has high structural and thermal stability, respectively. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE&#8208;SEM) analysis revealed the formation of dipyramidal shape Cs2AgBiCl6 crystals. Furthermore, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping shows the overlapping of Cs, Bi, Ag, Fe, and Cl elements and homogenous incorporation of Fe in Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite. The Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite shows a strong absorption at 380&#8197;nm. It extends up to 700&#8197;nm, suggesting that sub&#8208;band gap states transition may originate from the surface defect of the doped perovskite material. The radiative kinetics of the crystals was studied using the time&#8208;correlated single&#8208;photon counting (TCSPC) technique. Lattice parameters and band gap value of the Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskites predicted by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations are confirmed by XRD and UV/Visible spectroscopy analysis. Time&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;response characteristics of the Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite show fast response and recovery time of charge carriers. We believe that the successful incorporation of Fe in lead&#8208;free, environmentally friendly Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite can open a new class of doped double perovskites with significant potential optoelectronics devices fabrication and photocatalytic applications.

Furthermore, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping shows the overlapping of Cs, Bi, Ag, Fe, and Cl elements and homogenous incorporation of Fe in Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AgBiCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; double perovskite. The Fe&#8208;doped Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AgBiCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; double perovskite shows a strong absorption at 380&#8197;nm. It extends up to 700&#8197;nm, suggesting that sub&#8208;band gap states transition may originate from the surface defect of the doped perovskite material. The radiative kinetics of the crystals was studied using the time&#8208;correlated single&#8208;photon counting (TCSPC) technique. Lattice parameters and band gap value of the Fe&#8208;doped Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AgBiCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; double perovskites predicted by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations are confirmed by XRD and UV/Visible spectroscopy analysis. Time&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;response characteristics of the Fe&#8208;doped Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AgBiCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; double perovskite show fast response and recovery time of charge carriers. We believe that the successful incorporation of Fe in lead&#8208;free, environmentally friendly Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AgBiCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; double perovskite can open a new class of doped double perovskites with significant potential optoelectronics devices fabrication and photocatalytic applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Conformational Switching through the One&#8208;Electron Reduction of an Acridinium&#8208;based, &#947;&#8208;Cationic Phosphine Gold Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switch it: The reduction of the acridinium&#8208;based &#947;&#8208;cationic phosphine gold chloride complex neutralizes the carbenium unit and affords a stable radical. Due to a perturbation of the electrostatic potential profile of the complex and donor&#8211;acceptor bonding interactions, this reduction alters the complex's conformation, with the linear phosphine&#8208;gold&#8208;chloride moiety undergoing a windshield&#8208;wiper&#8208;type motion over the surface of the acridinium ring.







Abstract
Our efforts in the chemistry of gold complexes featuring ambiphilic phosphine&#8208;carbenium L/Z&#8208;type ligand have led us to consider the reduction of the carbenium moiety as a means to modulate the gold&#8211;carbenium interaction present in these complexes. Here, it was shown that the one&#8208;electron reduction of [(o&#8208;Ph2P(C6H4)Acr)AuCl]+ (Acr=9&#8208;N&#8208;methylacridinium) produces a neutral stable radical, the structure of which showed a marked increase in the Au&#8211;Acr distance. Related structural changes were observed for the phosphine oxide analogue [(o&#8208;Ph2P(O)(C6H4)Acr]+, the reduction of which interfered with the P=O&#8594;carbenium interaction. These structural effects, driven by a reduction&#8208;induced change in the electronic and electrostatic characteristics of the compounds, showed that the charge and accepting properties of the carbenium unit can be modulated. These results highlight the redox&#8208;noninnocence of carbenium Z&#8208;type ligand, a feature that can be exploited to induce specific conformational changes.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Dual C&#8722;C Coupling Reaction via Site Selective Cascade Formation by PdII&#8208;Cryptate of an Amino&#8208;Ether Heteroditopic Macrobicycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PdII catalysed site selective dual C&#8722;C Coupling in the presence of heteroditopic macrobicycle was achieved to synthesize symmetrical and unsymmetrical conjugated 1,3&#8208;diynes.







Abstract
Selectivity of aryl iodo over ethynyl iodo toward the Suzuki cross coupling reaction is explored by utilizing a palladium complex of amino&#8208;ether heteroditopic macrobicycle. Subsequently, unreacted ethynyl iodide undergoes homocoupling reaction in the same catalytic atmosphere, thereby representing a cascade dual C&#8722;C coupling reaction. Furthermore, this approach is extended for novel one&#8208;pot synthesis of unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;diynes.

         <title>Rational Molecular Design of Multifunctional Blue&#8208;Emitting Materials Based on Phenanthroimidazole Derivatives.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deeper blue: On the basis of multifunctional phenanthroimidazole&#8208;based material PTPBPTA, which acts both as a deep&#8208;blue fluorescent emitter and as a host material for phosphors, high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), yellow and red phosphorescent OLEDs, and a white OLED were fabricated.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue emitters with external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) exceeding 5&#8201;% are still scarce in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this work, by introducing a [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5&#8208;a] pyridine (TP) unit at the N1 position of phenanthroimidazole (PI), two luminescent materials, PTPTPA and PTPTPA, were obtained. Systematic photophysical analysis showed that the TP block is suitable for constructing hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) emitters. Its moderate electron&#8208;withdrawing ability and rigid planar structure can enhance the CT component while ensuring color purity. In addition, compared with PTPTPA, the additional phenyl ring of PTPBPTA not only increased the oscillator strength, but also decreased the Stokes shift. TDDFT calculations pointed out facile reverse intersystem crossing processes in PTPTPA from high&#8208;lying triplet states to the singlet excited state. A nondoped device based on PTPTPA as emitter showed impressive performance with EQEmax of 7.11&#8201;% and CIE coordinates of (0.15, 0.09). At the same time, it was also an efficient host for yellow and red phosphorescent OLEDs. By doping yellow (PPYBA) and red (BTPG) phosphorescent dyes into PTPTPA, a white OLED with a high EQE of 23.85&#8201;% was achieved. The successful design of PTPTPA not only provided an optimization choice for OLED emitters, but also demonstrated the empirical rules for the design of multifunctional deep&#8208;blue emitters.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Boron Nitride and Carbon Domains in Boron Carbide Nitride Nanotube Supported Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single metal atoms supported on boron carbide nitride nanotubes are considered as promising electrocatalysts for N2 reduction to NH3 with high activity and selectivity. The outstanding performance is ascribed to the synergistic effect of boron nitride and carbon domains, which tuned the charge polarization of metal&#8208;atom active site and the electronic properties of material.







Abstract
Developing the low&#8208;cost and efficient single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is of great importance while remains as a great challenge. The catalytic activity, selectivity and durability are all fundamentally related to the elaborate coordination environment of SACs. Using first&#8208;principles calculations, we investigated the SACs with single transition metal (TM) atom supported on defective boron carbide nitride nanotubes (BCNTs) as NRR electrocatalysts. Our results suggest that boron&#8208;vacancy defects on BCNTs can strongly immobilize TM atoms with large enough binding energy and high thermal/structural stability. Importantly, the synergistic effect of boron nitride (BN) and carbon domains comes up with the modifications of the charge polarization of single&#8208;TM&#8208;atom active site and the electronic properties of material, which has been proven to be the essential key to promote N2 adsorption, activation, and reduction. Specifically, six SACs (namely V, Mn, Fe, Mo, Ru, and W atoms embedded into defective BCNTs) can be used as promising candidates for NRR electrocatalysts as their NRR activity is higher than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the art Ru(0001) catalyst. In particular, single Mo atom supported on defective BCNTs with large tube diameter possesses the highest NRR activity while suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, with a low limiting potential of &#8722;0.62&#8197;V via associative distal path. This work suggests new opportunities for driving NH3 production by carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts under ambient conditions.

Fit in the groove: Hybrid DNAs with Watson&#8211;Crick and purine&#8211;purine base pairs decorated with dendritic side chains are prepared. Space&#8208;demanding side chains introduced into the 7&#8208;position of 5&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazaguanine&#8211;isoguanine base pairs are well accommodated in the large groove of purine&#8211;purine DNA and have a positive impact on helix stability.







Abstract
The Watson&#8211;Crick coding system depends on the molecular recognition of complementary purine and pyrimidine bases. Now, the construction of hybrid DNAs with Watson&#8211;Crick and purine&#8211;purine base pairs decorated with dendritic side chains was performed. Oligonucleotides with single and multiple incorporations of 5&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyguanosine, its tripropargylamine derivative, and 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyisoguanosine were synthesized. Duplex stability decreased if single modified purine&#8211;purine base pairs were inserted, but increased if pyrene residues were introduced by click chemistry. A growing number of consecutive 5&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazaguanine&#8211;isoguanine base pairs led to strong stepwise duplex stabilization, a phenomenon not observed for the guanine&#8211;isoguanine base pair. Spacious residues are well accommodated in the large groove of purine&#8211;purine DNA tracts. Changes to the global helical structure monitored by circular dichroism spectroscopy show the impact of functionalization to the global double&#8208;helix structure. This study explores new areas of molecular recognition realized by purine base pairs that are complementary in hydrogen bonding, but not in size, relative to canonical pairs.

Gold (I)&#8208;catalyzed higher&#8208;order cycloaddition: 8&#8208;Aryl&#8208;8&#8208;azafulvenes undergo a regioselective gold catalyzed [8+2] cycloaddition with electron&#8208;rich allenamines and ynamides to give dihydrocyclohepta[b]pyrrole derivatives. The cyclization takes place after the nucleophilic attack of the heptafulvene to the electrophilic intermediates formed by the coordination of cationic gold to either allene or triple bond moieties of the unsaturated systems.







Abstract
Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed higher&#8208;order [8+2] cycloadditions of 8&#8208;aryl&#8208;8&#8208;azaheptafulvenes 1 with allenamides 2 and ynamides 3 were studied. 1,8&#8208;Dihydrocycloheptapyrroles 4 were achieved by a regioselective [8+2] cycloaddition of azaheptafulvenes 1 and allenamides 2 in the presence of (2,4&#8208;ditBuC6H3O)3PAuNTf2 as catalyst. Besides, ynamides 3 and 8&#8208;aryl&#8208;8&#8208;azaheptafulvenes 1, undergo a regioselective [8+2] cycloaddition, to give 2&#8208;amido&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydrocycloheptapyrroles 7 in the presence of JohnPhosAuNTf2 as catalyst. Both reactions take place with good yields and with a variety of substituents. A plausible mechanism hypothesis suggests a nucleophilic attack of the 8&#8208;azaheptafulvene to the gold activated electron rich allene or alkyne moieties of the allenamide and ynamide, respectively.

The material PTPBTPA is reported in this work, which is shown in blue in the cover picture. It can act as a high&#8208;efficiency deep blue emitter as well as an efficient host material for yellow (the color of the bull in the image) and red (the festive color, indicating the coming of the Spring Festival) phosphors. Combining the blue fluorescence and yellow or red phosphorescence produced high&#8208;performance WOLED, which emits white light as the color of the external circle.

         <title>A DNA&#8208;Encoded Chemical Library Based on Peptide Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library (DEL) based on canonical and non&#8208;canonical peptide macrocycles (YO&#8208;DEL) was generated. The single&#8208;stranded format allowed for selections by affinity capture, through a novel selection method exploiting the competition with an antibody fragment and the annealing to a photoreactive moiety which allowed for selections by a photocrosslinking approach. The YO&#8208;DEL yielded ligands against proteins of pharmaceutical interest such as CAIX, HSA and NKp46, a protein expressed on the surface of activated NK&#8208;cells.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of a novel DNA&#8208;encoded library of macrocyclic peptide derivatives are described; the macrocycles are based on three sets of proteinogenic and non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acid building blocks and featuring the use of copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction for ring closure. The library (termed YO&#8208;DEL) which contains 1&#8201;254&#8201;838 compounds, was encoded with DNA in single&#8208;stranded format and was screened against target proteins of interest using affinity capture procedures and photocrosslinking. YO&#8208;DEL selections yielded specific binders against serum albumins, carbonic anhydrases and NKp46, a marker of activated Natural Killer cells.

         <title>A High&#8208;Performance Asymmetric Supercapacitor Based on Tungsten Oxide Nanoplates and Highly Reduced Graphene Oxide Electrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two dimensional nanomaterials: An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC, HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC) fabricated from tungsten oxide (m&#8208;WO3) nanoplates as a negative electrode and highly reduced graphene oxide (HRG) as a positive electrode material attains specific capacitance of 389&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with an associated high energy density of 93&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 500&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in a wide 1.6&#8197;V operating potential window. In addition, the HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC displays long&#8208;term cycling&#8208;stability, maintaining around 92&#8201;% of the original specific capacitance after 5000 galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge cycles.







Abstract
Tungsten oxide/graphene hybrid materials are attractive semiconductors for energy&#8208;related applications. Herein, we report an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC, HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC), fabricated from monoclinic tungsten oxide (m&#8208;WO3) nanoplates as a negative electrode and highly reduced graphene oxide (HRG) as a positive electrode material. The supercapacitor performance of the prepared electrodes was evaluated in an aqueous electrolyte (1&#8201;m H2SO4) using three&#8208; and two&#8208;electrode systems. The HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 389&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with an associated high energy density of 93&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 500&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in a wide 1.6&#8197;V operating potential window. In addition, the HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC displays long&#8208;term cycling stability, maintaining 92&#8201;% of the original specific capacitance after 5000 galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge cycles. The m&#8208;WO3 nanoplates were prepared hydrothermally while HRG was synthesized by a modified Hummers method.

         <title>Probing Multiconfigurational States by Spectroscopy: The Cerium XAS L3&#8208;edge Puzzle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ce L3 X&#8208;ray absorption spectra of CeO2 and Ce(C8H8)2 are calculated with relativistic multiconfigurational wavefunction approaches. Calculated spectra are in excellent agreement with experiments. The metal oxidation state in the ground vs. the core&#8208;excited states, and the experimental 4f electron count derived spectroscopically, are fully rationalized.







Abstract
The Ce L3 edge XAS spectra of CeO2 and cerocene [Ce(C8H8)2] were calculated with relativistic ab&#8208;initio multireference wavefunction approaches capable of reproducing the observed spectra accurately. The study aims to resolve the decades&#8208;long puzzle regarding the relationship between the number and relative intensities of the XAS peaks and the 4f electron occupation in the ground state (GS) versus the core&#8208;excited states (ESs). CeO2 and cerocene exemplify the different roles of covalent bonding and wavefunction configurational composition in the observed intensity patterns. Good agreement is found between the calculated GS 4f&#8208;shell occupations and the value derived from XAS measurements using peak areas (nf). The identity of the two&#8208;peaked Ce L3 edge is fully rationalized from the perspective of the relaxed wavefunctions for the GS and core ESs. The states underlying the different peaks differ from each other in a surprisingly simple way that can be associated with 4f1 vs. 4f0 sub&#8208;configurations. Furthermore, part of one of the cerocene spectral peaks is associated with 4f2 sub&#8208;configurations. The pattern therefore reveals excited states that can be interpreted in terms of Ce&#8201;IV and III oxidation numbers, as long assumed, with Ce&#8201;II states additionally appearing in the cerocene spectrum. While this work demonstrates the rough accuracy of the conventional approach to determining nf from Ce L3&#8208;edge XAS, limitations are highlighted in terms of the ultimate accuracy of this approach and the potential of observing new types of excited states. The need to determine the sources of nf by calculations, is stressed.

         <title>Fluorinated Rings: Conformation and Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine&#8208;containing compounds are widely used in different applications owing to their unique properties and effects. A particularly interesting feature is the impact of the C&#8722;F bond on the conformational preference when incorporated with organic molecules. In this Review, the conformational behavior of fluorinated aliphatic carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic systems will be discussed through presentation of the most recent applications.







Abstract
The introduction of fluorine atoms into molecules and materials across many fields of academic and industrial research is now commonplace, owing to their unique properties. A particularly interesting feature is the impact of fluorine substitution on the relative orientation of a C&#8722;F bond when incorporated into organic molecules. In this Review, we will be discussing the conformational behavior of fluorinated aliphatic carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic systems. The conformational preference of each system is associated with various interactions introduced by fluorine substitution such as charge&#8208;dipole, dipole&#8208;dipole, and hyperconjugative interactions. The contribution of each interaction on the stabilization of the fluorinated alicyclic system, which manifests itself in low conformations, will be discussed in detail. The novelty of this feature will be demonstrated by presenting the most recent applications.

         <title>Designed Construction of SrTiO3/SrSO4/Pt Heterojunctions with Boosted Photocatalytic H2 Evolution Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photocatalyst is designed with consideration of heterojunction band matching and porous structure. The SrTiO3/SrSO4 heterojunction using Pt as the co&#8208;catalyst reaches 396.82&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 16&#8197;times higher than that of SrTiO3/Pt. It is proposed that the presence of SrSO4 provides extra channels for electron transportation as well as promoting photocatalytic activity.







Abstract
Efficient separation of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs is a crucial factor for high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. Effective electron&#8211;hole separation and migration could be achieved by heterojunctions with suitable band structures. Herein, a porous SrTiO3/SrSO4 heterojunction is prepared by a sol&#8208;gel method at room temperature followed by an annealing process. XRD characterization suggests high crystallinity of the heterostructure. A well&#8208;defined interface between the two phases is confirmed by high&#8208;resolution (HR)TEM. The photocatalytic H2 evolution productivity of the SrTiO3/SrSO4 heterojunction with Pt as co&#8208;catalyst reaches 396.82&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 16&#8197;times higher than that of SrTiO3/Pt. The boosted photocatalytic activity of SrTiO3/SrSO4/Pt can be ascribed to the presence of SrSO4, which promotes the transfer and migration of photogenerated carriers by forming the heterojunction and porous structure, which provides a large amount of active sites. This novel porous heterostructure brings new ideas for the development of high&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts for H2 release.

         <title>Organic Nanoparticles with Persistent Luminescence for In Vivo Afterglow Imaging&#8208;Guided Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Afterglow organic nanoparticles (ONPs) with long lifetime and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission offered high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and good tissue penetration for afterglow imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) in vivo. Owing to strong afterglow luminescence and abundant singlet oxygen generation from the ONPs upon NIR laser irradiation, they have shown effective suppression of tumor growth after imaging&#8208;guided PDT in mice with minimal damage to major organs.







Abstract
Optical imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT), with precise localization and non&#8208;invasive treatment of tumors, is an emerging technique with great potential for cancer therapy. However, impaired by tissue auto&#8208;fluorescence that causes low signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR), most fluorescence imaging systems show poor sensitivity to tumors in vivo. In this study, we synthesized organic nanoparticles (ONPs) with persistent luminescence and good biocompatibility for afterglow imaging&#8208;guided PDT. The ONPs displayed near&#8208;infrared light emission with half&#8208;life time at minute level, which offered high SBR and good tissue penetration for in vivo afterglow tumor imaging. Taking advantage of their abundant singlet oxygen generation by NIR laser irradiation guided to the tumor sites, the ONPs also enabled imaging&#8208;guided PDT for efficient suppression of tumor growth in mice with minimal damage to major organs.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Afterglow organic nanoparticles&lt;/b&gt; (ONPs) with long lifetime and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission offered high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and good tissue penetration for afterglow imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) in vivo. Owing to strong afterglow luminescence and abundant singlet oxygen generation from the ONPs upon NIR laser irradiation, they have shown effective suppression of tumor growth after imaging&#8208;guided PDT in mice with minimal damage to major organs.

         <title>Naphthalenediimides with High Fluorescence Quantum Yield: Bright&#8208;Red, Stable, and Responsive Fluorescent Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of a bis&#8208;NH2 core&#8208;substituted naphthalenediimide (NDI) with remarkably high 
. A simple synthetic protocol to NH2&#8208;substituted NDIs is described. Dependent on the substituents, fluorescence can be tuned from bright&#8208;green to the red/NIR region and the 
 modulated by two orders of magnitude. These fluorophores show large Stokes&#8208;shift and great responsiveness to solvent polarity.







Abstract
The naphthalenediimide (NDI) scaffold in contrast to its higher congeners possess low&#8208;fluorescence. In spite of elegant synthetic developments, a highly emissive NDI is quite rare to find, as well as, a green&#8208;light&#8208;emitting NDI is yet to be explored. Herein, we report a novel class of symmetric and asymmetric NH2&#8208;substituted core&#8208;NDIs (1&#8211;5) with tunable fluorescence in the visible region and extending to the NIR frontier. Importantly, the bis&#8208;NH2&#8208;substituted NDI 2 revealed quantum yield, 
 of &#8776;81 and &#8776;68&#8201;% in toluene and DMSO, respectively, suggesting versatility of the fluorophore in a wide range of solvent polarity. The dye 1 is shown to be the first NDI&#8208;based green&#8208;light emitter. The donor piperidine group in 5 diminish the 
 by 40&#8208;fold providing a lever to modulate the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process. Our synthetic protocol applies a Pd catalyst and a benign hydride source simplifying the non&#8208;trivial &#8722;NH2 group integration at the NDI&#8208;core. TD&#8208;DFT calculations predicted strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds in the excited state in the bulk nonpolar medium and responsiveness to solvent polarity. The maximization of the NDI emission outlined here would further boost the burgeoning repertoire of applications of the NDI scaffold.

         <title>Uranium versus Thorium: Synthesis and Reactivity of [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U[&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2]</title>

         <dc:description>
The intrinsic reactivity of a stable uranium metallacyclopropene complex, [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U(&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2), was evaluated and compared to that of other uranium and thorium metallacyclopropenes. Although structurally similar, the thorium and uranium metallacyclopropenes exhibit distinctively different reactivity.







Abstract
The synthesis, electronic structure, and reactivity of a uranium metallacyclopropene were comprehensively studied. Addition of diphenylacetylene (PhC&#8801;CPh) to the uranium phosphinidene metallocene [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U=P&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;tBu3C6H2 (1) yields the stable uranium metallacyclopropene, [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U[&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2] (2). Based on density functional theory (DFT) results the 5f orbital contributions to the bonding within the metallacyclopropene U&#8208;(&#951;2&#8208;C=C) moiety increases significantly compared to the related ThIV compound [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2Th[&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2], which also results in more covalent bonds between the [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U2+ and [&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2]2&#8722; fragments. Although the thorium and uranium complexes are structurally closely related, different reaction patterns are therefore observed. For example, 2 reacts as a masked synthon for the low&#8208;valent uranium(II) metallocene [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2UII when reacted with Ph2E2 (E=S, Se), alkynes and a variety of hetero&#8208;unsaturated molecules such as imines, ketazine, bipy, nitriles, organic azides, and azo derivatives. In contrast, five&#8208;membered metallaheterocycles are accessible when 2 is treated with isothiocyanate, aldehydes, and ketones.

         <title>Sulfur Tetrahydride and Allied Superhydride Clusters: When Resonance Takes Precedence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H2S + H2 reactants are (computationally) found to form metastable &#8220;superhydride&#8221; SH4 that in turn forms (SH4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H2S)n = &#8220;(SH3)2n&#8221; clusters with well&#8208;adapted (x,y,z) geometry for crystallization. Natural resonance theory (NRT) clarifies the uniqueness of the hypervalent bonding in this species.







Abstract
Sulfur offers a variety of bonding surprises compared to the parent oxygen atom of the chalcogen family. In the present work, we employ standard quantum chemistry methods to characterize formation of previously unrecognized sulfur tetrahydride (C4v&#8208;symmetric SH4) from hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and molecular hydrogen (H2) on the ground state potential energy surface. The unusual intramolecular interactions of SH4 defy Lewis&#8208;like bonding conceptions, exhibiting the dominance of resonance&#8208;type donor&#8208;acceptor delocalizations well beyond those of SF4 (C2v sawhorse geometry) and other known tetrahalides. The distressed character of SH4 bonding also leads to exotic intermolecular structural motifs in clusters of pure (SH4)n and mixed (SH4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H2S)n composition. We evaluate structural, spectroscopic, and electronic properties for various 2D/3D coordination patterns and discuss how (SH4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H2S)n&#8208;type building blocks may relate to recent experimental studies of superconductivity in high&#8208;pressure materials of &#8220;SH3&#8221; stoichiometry.

         <title>Tuning the Properties of MOF&#8208;808 via Defect Engineering and Metal Nanoparticle Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defects and metal nanoparticle encapsulations have been shown to have significant impacts on structure, texture, morphology and reactivity of the synthesized MOFs. Control over defects creation and metal nanoparticle encapsulations can become useful avenues to adjust the properties of MOFs.







Abstract
Defect engineering and metal encapsulation are considered as valuable approaches to fine&#8208;tune the reactivity of metal&#8211;organic frameworks. In this work, various MOF&#8208;808 (Zr) samples are synthesized and characterized with the final aim to understand how defects and/or platinum nanoparticle encapsulation act on the intrinsic and reactive properties of these MOFs. The reactivity of the pristine, defective and Pt encapsulated MOF&#8208;808 is quantified with water adsorption and CO2 adsorption calorimetry. The results reveal strong competitive effects between crystal morphology and missing linker defects which in turn affect the crystal morphology, porosity, stability, and reactivity. In spite of leading to a loss in porosity, the introduction of defects (missing linkers or Pt nanoparticles) is beneficial to the stability of the MOF&#8208;808 towards water and could also be advantageously used to tune adsorption properties of this MOF family.

         <title>Synthetic Approaches to Selenoesters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selenoesters are an important class of compounds that have wide possibilities for chemical transformations, being considered excellent building blocks for the synthesis of more complex molecules. In this review, an overview of the available methods for the synthesis of selenoesters will be presented. This overview is hoped to serve as a source of inspiration for the development of new strategies for the synthesis of this type of compound, as well as for their use as building blocks in synthesis.







Abstract
Selenoesters are compounds of great synthetic relevance since they can be used in several types of chemical transformations and mainly due to their great capacity in the formation of acyl radicals. Therefore, the scientific community has been developing several methods for the synthesis of this class of molecules. This review will address the synthesis of these compounds from different starting materials, such as carboxylic acids derivatives (acid chlorides and anhydrides), aldehydes, selenoacetylenes and miscellaneous methods.

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrasubstituted Arenes by Vicinal Functionalization of Arynes Derived from Aryl(Mes)iodonium Salts**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Densely functionalized 1,2,3,4&#8208;substituted arenes are found in societally important molecules but are challenging to synthesize. This work reports on a method that uses aryl(Mes)iodonium salts as an aryne precursor via regioselective deprotonation. Various arynophiles are used and result in formation of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;Cl, and C&#8722;Si bonds; mechanistic insights from experiments and DFT calculations are provided.







Abstract
Herein, the synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted benzenoid rings, motifs found in pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and natural products, is described.[1] In the past, the regioselective syntheses of such compounds have been a significant challenge. This work reports a method using substituted arynes derived from aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to access a range of densely functionalized 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted benzenoid rings. Significantly, it was found that halide substituents are compatible under these conditions, enabling post&#8208;synthetic elaboration via palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling. This concise strategy is predicated on two regioselective events: 1)&#8197;ortho&#8208; deprotonation of aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to generate a substituted aryne intermediate, and 2)&#8197;regioselective trapping of said arynes, thereby improving previously reported reaction conditions to generate arynes at room temperature and in shorter reaction times. Density functional theory (DFT) computations and linear free energy relationship (LFER) analysis suggest the regioselectivity of deprotonation is influenced by both proximal and distal ring substituents on the aryne precursor. A competition experiment further reveals the role of arene substituents on relative reactivity of aryl(Mes)iodoniums as aryne precursors.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Porous SiFe@C Composite with Excellent Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Threesome is impressive: A novel and scalable strategy for the fabrication of porous SiFe@C composite with mesoporous structure is reported. The conductive phase of FeSi2 is partially retained; together with a uniform carbon layer excellent lithium storage is achieved.







Abstract
Utilizing cost&#8208;effective raw materials to prepare high&#8208;performance silicon&#8208;based anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is both challenging and attractive. Herein, a porous SiFe@C (pSiFe@C) composite derived from low&#8208;cost ferrosilicon is prepared via a scalable three&#8208;step procedure, including ball milling, partial etching, and carbon layer coating. The pSiFe@C material integrates the advantages of the mesoporous structure, the partially retained FeSi2 conductive phase, and a uniform carbon layer (12&#8211;16&#8197;nm), which can substantially alleviate the huge volume expansion effect in the repeated lithium&#8208;ion insertion/extraction processes, effectively stabilizing the solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI) film and markedly enhancing the overall electronic conductivity of the material. Benefiting from the rational structure, the obtained pSiFe@C hybrid material delivers a reversible capacity of 1162.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200&#8197;cycles at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a higher initial coulombic efficiency of 82.30&#8201;%. In addition, it shows large discharge capacities of 803.1 and 600.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 500&#8197;cycles at 2 and 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively, manifesting an excellent electrochemical lithium storage. This work provides a good prospect for the commercial production of silicon&#8208;based anode materials for LIBs with a high lithium&#8208;storage capacity.

         <title>Chemical Bonding in Homoleptic Carbonyl Cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Cu, Ag, Au)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donation of an electron pair from the HOMO of [Fe(CO)5]2 to the 4s LUMO of Cu+ giving the (+,+) component of the Fe&#8208;Cu&#8208;Fe &#963; bond in [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2]+. The associated charge flow with the direction red&#8594;blue is given by the deformation density.







Abstract
Syntheses of the copper and gold complexes [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6] and [Au{Fe(CO)5}2][HOB{3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3}3] containing the homoleptic carbonyl cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Cu, Au) are reported. Structural data of the rare, trimetallic Cu2Fe, Ag2Fe and Au2Fe complexes [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6], [Ag{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6] and [Au{Fe(CO)5}2][HOB{3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3}3] are also given. The silver and gold cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Ag, Au) possess a nearly linear Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8217; moiety but the Fe&#8208;Cu&#8208;Fe&#8217; in [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6] exhibits a significant bending angle of 147&#176; due to the strong interaction with the [SbF6]&#8722; anion. The Fe(CO)5 ligands adopt a distorted square&#8208;pyramidal geometry in the cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+, with the basal CO groups inclined towards M. The geometry optimization with DFT methods of the cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Cu, Ag, Au) gives equilibrium structures with linear Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8217; fragments and D2 symmetry for the copper and silver cations and D4d symmetry for the gold cation. There is nearly free rotation of the Fe(CO)5 ligands around the Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8217; axis. The calculated bond dissociation energies for the loss of both Fe(CO)5 ligands from the cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ show the order M=Au (De=137.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1)&gt;Cu (De=109.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1)&gt;Ag (De=92.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). The QTAIM analysis shows bond paths and bond critical points for the M&#8722;Fe linkage but not between M and the CO ligands. The EDA&#8208;NOCV calculations suggest that the [Fe(CO)5]&#8594;M+&#8592;[Fe(CO)5] donation is significantly stronger than the [Fe(CO)5]&#8592;M+&#8594;[Fe(CO)5] backdonation. Inspection of the pairwise orbital interactions identifies four contributions for the charge donation of the Fe(CO)5 ligands into the vacant (n)s and (n)p AOs of M+ and five components for the backdonation from the occupied (n&#8208;1)d AOs of M+ into vacant ligand orbitals.

         <title>Fluorogenic Squaraine Dendrimers for Background&#8208;Free Imaging of Integrin Receptors in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorogenic dendrimer probe for imaging membrane receptors has been developed. It combines eight squaraine dyes that undergo polarity&#8208;dependent aggregation&#8211;disaggregation within the dendrimer, resulting in OFF&#8211;ON fluorescence response to a biomolecular target. It enables integrin&#8208;specific imaging of cancer cells with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio.







Abstract
To overcome the limited brightness of existing fluorogenic molecular probes for biomolecular targets, we introduce a concept of fluorogenic dendrimer probe, which undergoes polarity&#8208;dependent switching due to intramolecular aggregation&#8208;caused quenching of its fluorophores. Based on a rational design of dendrimers with four and eight squaraine dyes, we found that octamer bearing dyes through a sufficiently long PEG(8) linker displays &gt;400&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement from water to non&#8208;polar dioxane. High extinction coefficient (&#8776;2,300,000&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1) resulted from eight squaraine dyes and quantum yield (&#8776;25&#8201;%) make this octamer the brightest environment&#8208;sensitive fluorogenic molecule reported to date. Its conjugate with cyclic RGD used at low concentration (3&#8197;nm) enables integrin&#8208;specific fluorescence imaging of cancer cells with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio. The developed dendrimer probe is a &#8220;golden middle&#8221; between molecular probes and nanoparticles, combining small size, turn&#8208;on response and high brightness, important for bioimaging.

         <title>Specific Ion&#8211;Protein Interactions Influence Bacterial Ice Nucleation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effects of ions on bacterial ice nucleation: Freezing droplet experiments, sum&#8208;frequency generation spectroscopy, and molecular dynamic simulations were used to demonstrate that ions can profoundly influence the efficiency of bacterial ice nucleators in a manner that follows the Hofmeister series. The different effects are due to specific interactions of the ions with ice&#8208;nucleating proteins on the surface of the bacteria.







Abstract
Ice nucleation&#8208;active bacteria are the most efficient ice nucleators known, enabling the crystallization of water at temperatures close to 0&#8201;&#176;C, thereby overcoming the kinetically hindered phase transition process at these conditions. Using highly specialized ice&#8208;nucleating proteins (INPs), they can cause frost damage to plants and influence the formation of clouds and precipitation in the atmosphere. In nature, the bacteria are usually found in aqueous environments containing ions. The impact of ions on bacterial ice nucleation efficiency, however, has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that ions can profoundly influence the efficiency of bacterial ice nucleators in a manner that follows the Hofmeister series. Weakly hydrated ions inhibit bacterial ice nucleation whereas strongly hydrated ions apparently facilitate ice nucleation. Surface&#8208;specific sum&#8208;frequency generation spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the different effects are due to specific interactions of the ions with the INPs on the surface of the bacteria. Our results demonstrate that heterogeneous ice nucleation facilitated by bacteria strongly depends upon the nature of the ions, and specific ion&#8211;protein interactions are essential for the complete description of heterogeneous ice nucleation by bacteria.

         <title>Metal Cation Valency Dependence in Morphology Evolution of Cu2&#8722;xS Nanodisk Seeds and Their Pseudomorphic Cation Exchanges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin cation valency&#8208;dependent morphology evolution of Cu2&#8722;xS nanodisk seeds was initially developed. Subsequent pseudomorphic full/partial cation exchanges with Zn2+ and Cd2+ to produce traditionally inaccessible nanostructures were reported as well.







Abstract
A crucial parameter in the design of semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) with controllable optical, magnetic, electronic, and catalytic properties is the morphology. Herein, we demonstrate the potential of additive metal cations with variable valency to direct the morphology evolution of copper&#8208;deficient Cu2&#8722;xS nanoparticles in the process of seed&#8208;mediated growth. In particular, the djurleite Cu1.94S seed could evolve from disk into tetradecahedron in the presence of tin(IV) cations, whereas they merely formed sharp hexagonal nanodisks with tin(II) cations. In addition to djurleite Cu1.94S, the tin(IV) cations could be generalized to direct the growth of roxbyite Cu1.8S and covellite CuS nanodisk seeds into tetradecahedra. We further perform pseudomorphic cation exchanges of Cu1.94S tetradecahedra with Zn2+ and Cd2+ to produce polyhedral zinc sulfide (ZnS) and cadmium sulfide (CdS) NPs. Moreover, we achieve Cu1.8S/ZnS and Cu1.94S/CdS tetradecahedral heterostructures via partial cation exchange, which are otherwise inaccessible by traditional synthetic approaches.

         <title>Overview of N&#8208;Rich Antennae Investigated in Lanthanide&#8208;Based Temperature Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Noncontact temperature sensors are gaining importance. Lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors stand out as they benefit form for example, high photostability. In this Review, an extensive overview on N&#8208;rich antennae used in lanthanide based temperature sensing is provided. The potential of N&#8208;rich small molecules, bi&#8208;and polynuclear complexes, metal organic frameworks, periodic mesoporous organosilicas and porous organic polymers are discussed.







Abstract
The market share of noncontact temperature sensors is expending due to fast technological and medical evolutions. In the wide variety of noncontact sensors, lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors stand out. They benefit from high photostability, relatively long decay times and high quantum yields. To circumvent their low molar light absorption, the incorporation of a light&#8208;harvesting antenna is required. This Review provides an overview of the nitrogen&#8208;rich antennae in lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors, emitting in the visible light spectrum, and discusses their temperature sensor ability. The N&#8208;rich ligands are incorporated in many different platforms. The investigation of different antennae is required to develop temperature sensors with diverse optical properties and to create a diverse offer for the multiple application fields. Molecular probes, consisting of small molecules, are first discussed. Furthermore, the thermometer properties of ratiometric temperature sensors, based on di&#8208; and polynuclear complexes, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, periodic mesoporous organosilicas and porous organic polymers, are summarized. The antenna mainly determines the application potential of the ratiometric thermometer. It can be observed that molecular probes are operational in the broad physiological range, metal&#8211;organic frameworks are generally very useful in the cryogenic region, periodic mesoporous organosilica show temperature dependency in the physiological range, and porous organic polymers are operative in the cryogenic&#8208;to&#8208;medium temperature range.

         <title>Biological and Medical Applications of Calcium Phosphate Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium phosphate nanoparticles are well suited to transport organic or biological molecules into cells and tissue. They are well tolerated by cells and organisms and have a clearly defined degradation pathway, also due to their almost ubiquitous presence in the body. Promising applications for them are seen in drug and gene delivery and also in immunization, for example, for vaccination. This Review explores the synthesis, characterization, functionalization and biomedical applications of calcium phosphate nanoparticles from the recent literature.







Abstract
Calcium phosphate nanoparticles have a high biocompatibility and biodegradability due to their chemical similarity to human hard tissue, for example, bone and teeth. They can be used as efficient carriers for different kinds of biomolecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, peptides, antibodies, or drugs, which alone are not able to enter cells where their biological effect is required. They can be loaded with cargo molecules by incorporating them, unlike solid nanoparticles, and also by surface functionalization. This offers protection, for example, against nucleases, and the possibility for cell targeting. If such nanoparticles are functionalized with fluorescing dyes, they can be applied for imaging in vitro and in vivo. Synthesis, functionalization and cell uptake mechanisms of calcium phosphate nanoparticles are discussed together with applications in transfection, gene silencing, imaging, immunization, and bone substitution. Biodistribution data of calcium phosphate nanoparticles in vivo are reviewed.

         <title>Catalytic Performance of Zr&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Zr&#8208;abtc and MIP&#8208;200 in Selective Oxidations with H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An eight&#8208;connected metal&#8211;organic framework Zr&#8208;abtc catalyzes a range of H2O2&#8208;based selective oxidations. The significant predominance of 1,2&#8208;epoxide in the epoxidation of carvone and high sulfone selectivity in thioether oxidation point to a nucleophilic oxidation mechanism. With highly reactive alkenes, such as caryophyllene, electrophilic oxidation can also be realized.







Abstract
The catalytic performance of Zr&#8208;abtc and MIP&#8208;200 metal&#8211;organic frameworks consisting of 8&#8208;connected Zr6 clusters and tetratopic linkers was investigated in H2O2&#8208;based selective oxidations and compared with that of 12&#8208;coordinated UiO&#8208;66 and UiO&#8208;67. Zr&#8208;abtc demonstrated advantages in both substrate conversion and product selectivity for epoxidation of electron&#8208;deficient C=C bonds in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. The significant predominance of 1,2&#8208;epoxide in carvone epoxidation, coupled with high sulfone selectivity in thioether oxidation, points to a nucleophilic oxidation mechanism over Zr&#8208;abtc. The superior catalytic performance in the epoxidation of unsaturated ketones correlates with a larger amount of weak basic sites in Zr&#8208;abtc. Electrophilic activation of H2O2 can also be realized, as evidenced by the high activity of Zr&#8208;abtc in epoxidation of the electron&#8208;rich C=C bond in caryophyllene. XRD and FTIR studies confirmed the retention of the Zr&#8208;abtc structure after the catalysis. The low activity of MIP&#8208;200 in H2O2&#8208;based oxidations is most likely related to its specific hydrophilicity, which disfavors adsorption of organic substrates and H2O2.

         <title>New Noncentrosymmetric Tetrel Pnictides Composed of Square&#8208;Planar Gold(I) with Peculiar Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bonding natures: Compared with common types of AuI coordination observed in extended solids, square&#8208;planar coordination is rare. Au(I)relia shows off the three&#8208;centered bonding of Au&#8722;Tt&#8722;Au and Au&#8722;Pn&#8722;Au (on her feathers; Tt=tetrel, Pn=pnictogen), square&#8208;planar cis&#8208;[AuTt2Pn2] units (her body), and linear chains of Au (her legs) that are characteristic of equiatomic AuSiAs, AuGeP, and AuGeAs compounds.







Abstract
Three novel isostructural equiatomic gold tetrel pnictides, AuSiAs, AuGeP, and AuGeAs, were synthesized and characterized. These phases crystallize in the noncentrosymmetric (NCS) monoclinic space group Cc (no. 9), featuring square&#8208;planar Au within cis&#8208;[AuTt2Pn2] units (Tt=tetrel, Si, Ge; Pn=pnictogen, P, As). This is in drastic contrast to the structure of previously reported AuSiP, which exhibits typical linear coordination of Au with Si and P. Chemical bonding analysis through the electron localization function suggests covalent two&#8208;center two&#8208;electron Tt&#8722;Pn bonds, and three&#8208;center Au&#8722;Tt&#8722;Au and Au&#8722;Pn&#8722;Au bonds with 1.6&#8197;e&#8722; per bond. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies support the covalent and nonionic nature of Au&#8722;Pn and Au&#8722;Tt bonds. The title materials were found to be n&#8208;type narrow&#8208;gap semiconductors or semimetals, with nearly temperature&#8208;independent electrical resistivities and low thermal conductivities. A combination of the semimetallic properties with tunable NCS structure provides opportunities for the development of materials based on gold tetrel pnictides.

         <dc:description>
Spinning around: Two metal&#8211;organic colloids based on achiral starting materials show active CD and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties in a vortex field. The optical properties of the colloids can be transferred to achiral Rhodamine derivatives, with glum 10&#8722;2 in magnitude and quantum yields of 40&#8211;83&#8201;%.

Recently, scientists have reported a range of chiral fluorescence materials or chiral composites that can emit circularly polarized luminescence. Herein, two achiral metal&#8211;organic colloidal solutions were studied, showing active circularly polarized luminescence, which is observed in vortex stirring. The absolute values for glum are 0.05 and 0.03 and the plus or minus sign of glum depends on the colloidal structure and stirring direction, which make the property easy to manipulate. Further, the host&#8211;guest interaction study suggests both electrostatic interactions and coordination bonding may influence the chiroptical property from the colloidal solution to the guest molecule. Rhodamine 6G and its carboxylic acid derivative exhibit good quantum yields and acceptable glum values in the colloidal solution.
