Recently developed fast cysteine bioconjugation reactions are summarized in this Concept, with a focus on the mechanisms and design principles that underlie the high efficiency of the new cysteine&#8208;modifying reagents.







Abstract
Cysteine bioconjugation serves as a powerful tool in biological research and has been widely used for chemical modification of proteins, constructing antibody&#8208;drug conjugates, and enabling cell imaging studies. Cysteine conjugation reactions with fast kinetics and exquisite selectivity have been under heavy pursuit as they would allow clean protein modification with just stoichiometric amounts of reagents, which minimizes side reactions, simplifies purification and broadens functional group tolerance. In this concept, we summarize the recent advances in fast cysteine bioconjugation, and discuss the mechanism and chemical principles that underlie the high efficiencies of the newly developed cysteine reactive reagents.

         <title>Improved Dye Survival in Expansion Microscopy through Stabilizer&#8208;Conjugated Linkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 66, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of stabilizer&#8208;containing multifunctional molecules has been developed and evaluated in expansion microscopy. These multifunctional molecules not only enable effective protection of dyes from radicals during polymerization, but also improve photostability while showing no negative impact on polymerization.







Abstract
Expansion microscopy (ExM) has been widely used to detect biomolecules in cultured cells and tissue samples due to its enablement of super resolution imaging with conventional microscopes, via physical expansion of samples. However, reaction conditions inherent to the process bring about strong fluorescent signal loss during polymerization and digestion and thus limit the brightness of the signal obtained post expansion. Here, we explore the impact of stabilizer&#8208;containing organic fluorophores in ExM, as a mitigation strategy for this radical&#8208;induced dye degradation. Through direct conjugation of 4&#8208;nitrophenylalanine (NPA) to our previously developed trifunctional reagents, we validate and demonstrate that these multifunctional linkers enable visualization of different organelles with improved fluorescent intensity, owning to protection of the dyes to radical induced degradation as well as to photoprotection upon imaging. At this point, we cannot disentangle the relative contribution of both mechanisms. Furthermore, we report anchoring linkers that allow straightforward application of NPA or Trolox to commercially available fluorophore&#8208;conjugated antibodies. We show that these anchoring linkers enable complete retention of biological targets while increasing fluorophore photostability. Our results provide guidance in exploring these stabilizer&#8208;modified agents in ExM and methods for increased signal survival through the polymerization steps of the ExM protocols.

         <title>Computational Insights of Selective Intramolecular O&#8208;atom Transfer Mediated by Bioinspired Copper Complexes</title>

Computational insights on reactivity: The stereoselective copper&#8208;mediated intramolecular C&#8722;H bond hydroxylation is investigated using DFT calculations. The computed mechanism involves a dinuclear side&#8208;on &#956;&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;peroxo dicopper(II) adduct in equilibrium with the key oxidizing intermediate bis(&#956;&#8208;oxo) dicopper(III) species. The difference of reactivity towards internal substrates bearing activated or non&#8208;activated C&#8722;H bonds is rationalized.







Abstract
The stereoselective copper&#8208;mediated hydroxylation of intramolecular C&#8722;H bonds from tridentate ligands is reinvestigated using DFT calculations. The computational study aims at deciphering the mechanism of C&#8722;H hydroxylation obtained after reaction of Cu(I) precursors with dioxygen, using ligands bearing either activated (L1) or non&#8208;activated (L2) C&#8722;H bonds. Configurational analysis allows rationalization of the experimentally observed regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The computed mechanism involves the formation of a side&#8208;on peroxide species (P) in equilibrium with the key intermediate bis&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;oxo) isomer (O) responsible for the C&#8722;H activation step. The P/O equilibrium yields the same activation barrier for the two complexes. However, the main difference between the two model complexes is observed during the C&#8722;H activation step, where the complex bearing the non&#8208;activated C&#8722;H bonds yields a higher energy barrier, accounting for the experimental lack of reactivity of this complex under those conditions.

         <title>Continuous Charge Transport in Carbon Nitride Modulated by Interfacial Chemical Bond and Homophase Junction to Boost Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 66, November 25, 2022. </description>

The electron transfer chain, which mimics the electron transport chain in natural photosynthetic system fabricated by the synergistic interfacial chemical bond and brookite TiO2 homophase junction promotes the charge separation efficiency in 2D carbon nitride.







Abstract
Efficient separation of photogenerated electrons and holes is of key importance in photocatalysis. Tuning the charge separation pathway is significant but still suffering from low efficiency for the charge extraction from semiconductors. Herein, taking 2D g&#8208;C3N4 (CN) nanosheets as a model photocatalyst, it was found the decoration of homophase junction between brookite TiO2 rods and nanoparticles (BN&#8208;BR) onto CN can effectively modulate photogenerated charge extraction and transfer in BN&#8208;BR/CN composites. The BN&#8208;BR/CN exhibits a remarkably enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution under visible light irradiation (&#955;&gt;420&#8197;nm) compared with the single component. A continuous electron transfer channel constructed by an interfacial chemical bond Ti&#8722;O&#8722;N between CN and brookite rods (BR) and BN&#8208;BR homophase junction between brookite nanoparticles and rods was proposed to benefit the charge extraction and transfer. This work provides a strategy to tune the charge separation and transfer to facilitate the photocatalytic performance in heterogeneous photocatalysis.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Controlled Selective Mono&#8208; vs. Di&#8208;ortho&#8208;Arylation for the Synthesis of Arylhydrazine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 66, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective formation of mono&#8208; and double&#8208;arylated products at ortho position was feasible via the pyrazolone directing group. The selectivity of the palladium&#8208;catalyzed reaction was controlled by the temperature and derived from the structure of the used directing group. This allowed the achievement of unsymmetrical double&#8208;substituted arylated products in a one&#8208;pot procedure. Ortho&#8208;arylated pyrazolones underwent unusual decarboxylative cleavage under relatively mild conditions to form hydrazones.







Abstract
A method of palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation assisted with a 3,4,4&#8208;trimethylpyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;on directing group, selectively providing mono&#8208; and di&#8208;ortho&#8208;arylated products is reported.

     alt="Temperature-Controlled Selective Mono- vs. Di-ortho-Arylation for the Synthesis of Arylhydrazine Derivatives"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The selective formation of mono- and double-arylated products at &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt; position was feasible via the pyrazolone directing group. The selectivity of the palladium-catalyzed reaction was controlled by the temperature and derived from the structure of the used directing group. This allowed the achievement of unsymmetrical double-substituted arylated products in a one-pot procedure. &lt;i&gt;Ortho&lt;/i&gt;-arylated pyrazolones underwent unusual decarboxylative cleavage under relatively mild conditions to form hydrazones.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A method of palladium-catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation assisted with a 3,4,4-trimethylpyrazol-5-on directing group, selectively providing mono- and di-&lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-arylated products is reported. Steric hindrance appearing between the directing group and the already introduced aryl substituent enables control of mono- vs. diarylation selectivity by the temperature of the reaction. Taking advantage of this, a series of monosubstituted and disubstituted derivatives were obtained in good yields. Moreover, unsymmetrical double-arylation in a one-pot procedure was developed to give corresponding products in reasonable yields. Additionally, synthesis and X-ray study of intermediate palladium metallacycles of both, the first and second arylation reactions, were conducted. X-ray structure comparison emphasizes the geometrical differences that were consistent with the observed reactivity. Finally, decarboxylative cleavage of the pyrazolone directing group under mild conditions gave synthetically useful hydrazones. The presented solution opens the alternative synthetic way to such &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt; arylated derivatives of arylhydrazines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Restrictive Regulation of Ionic Liquid Quaternary Ammonium Salt in SBA&#8208;15 Pore Channel for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 66, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
SBA&#8208;15 with metal based quaternary ammonium salt was used for the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides. Ionic liquids grafting into the pore channel of SBA&#8208;15 provide an alternative chance to improve the catalytic performance at 1.5&#8197;MPa and 90 &#176;C.







Abstract
Herein, the synthesis of a new type of catalyst, SBA&#8722;M (Schiff complex of different metal types grafted on SBA&#8208;15) based on a quaternization reaction, is described. Various amounts of ionic liquid were grafted into the pore channels of SBA&#8208;15 using the post&#8208;grafting method, which allowed the ionic liquid to be grafted into the pore channels restrictively. Notably, over six cycles, SBA&#8722;Mn (0.2) has been shown to maintain its catalytic activity and stability. In addition, a reaction mechanism for the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides based on density&#8208;functional theory is proposed. The cycloaddition reaction of CO2 and epoxides is an efficient way of carbon fixation. It is demonstrated that the metal coordinated with the oxygen atom of the epoxides and that a halogen attacked the carbon of epoxides. Moreover, theoretical calculations and synthesis strategy provide a new approach for CO2 conversion.

         <title>Probing the Structural Dynamics of a Bacterial Chaperone in Its Native Environment by Nitroxide&#8208;Based EPR Spectroscopy</title>

Take a quick look: NarJ protein structural dynamics was investigated by SDSL&#8208;EPR in the complex environment of the cell. In particular, we exploited the sensitivity of nitroxide labels to report protein dynamics at room temperature. Moreover, we demonstrated that such studies can be performed within 15&#8197;minutes, thus preserving both cell integrity and the activity of the protein under investigation.







Abstract
One of the greatest current challenges in structural biology is to study protein dynamics over a wide range of timescales in complex environments, such as the cell. Among magnetic resonances suitable for this approach, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy coupled to site&#8208;directed spin labeling (SDSL&#8208;EPR) has emerged as a promising tool to study protein local dynamics and conformational ensembles. In this work, we exploit the sensitivity of nitroxide labels to report protein local dynamics at room temperature. We demonstrate that such studies can be performed while preserving both the integrity of the cells and the activity of the protein under investigation. Using this approach, we studied the structural dynamics of the chaperone NarJ in its natural host, Escherichia coli. We established that spin&#8208;labeled NarJ is active inside the cell. We showed that the cellular medium affects NarJ structural dynamics in a site&#8208;specific way, while the structural flexibility of the protein is maintained. Finally, we present and discuss data on the time&#8208;resolved dynamics of NarJ in cellular context.

Herein, we present the first polyproline helix to self&#8208;assemble into a reversibly porous, crystalline, supramolecular peptide framework (SPF). This framework is assembled from a short oligoproline, adopting the polyproline II conformation, driven by hydrogen&#8208;bonding and dispersion interactions. Thermal activation, guest&#8208;induced dynamic porosity and enantioselective guest inclusion have been demonstrated for this novel system. The principles of the self&#8208;assembly associated with this SPF will be used as a blueprint allowing for the further development of helical peptide linkers in the rational design of SPFs and metal&#8208;peptide frameworks.

         <title>Borate Buffer as a Key Player in Cu&#8208;Based Homogeneous Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 66, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A BO33&#8722; anion from borate buffer provides a structural bridge between low&#8208;cost Cu complexes to form a new in situ trinuclear complex as a fast electrocatalyst for homogeneous water oxidation; likewise, the borate species from the buffer solution at pH&#8197;9 facilitate the high turnover frequency (TOF) by playing a significant role in the O&#8208;O bond formation step.







Abstract
Borate buffer was found to have both structural and functional roles within a low&#8208;cost tri&#8208;copper electrocatalyst for homogeneous water oxidation that exhibits a high turnover frequency of 310&#8197;s&#8722;1. The borate buffer was shown to facilitate the catalytic activity by both bridging the three Cu ions and participating in O&#8722;O bond formation. Phosphate and acetate buffers did not show such roles, making borate a unique player in this catalytic system.

Cyclopentane&#8208; and cyclohexane&#8208;fused arsoles were also synthesized. While the former was stable, the latter gradually decomposed to the corresponding diketone under ambient conditions owing to its frustrated structure. The frustration of the fused cyclohexane also caused large structural relaxation, resulting in a relatively large Stokes shift.







Abstract
Herein, we have synthesized a variety of cycloalkane&#8208;fused arsoles. Cyclopentane and cyclohexane were incorporated into the cycloalkane&#8208;fused arsoles. Surprisingly, cyclohexane&#8208;fused arsole 2&#8201;a gradually decomposed via oxidative ring&#8208;opening under ambient conditions, while cyclopentane&#8208;fused 1&#8201;a was stable. In addition, the Stokes shift of 2&#8201;a (7766&#8197;cm&#8722;1) is larger than that of 1&#8201;a (5120&#8197;cm&#8722;1). The effects of the fused cycloalkane on the stability and photophysical properties were attributed to the distortion of the cycloalkane. Computational calculations demonstrated that the cyclohexane moiety in 2&#8201;a was frustrated upon being incorporated into the rigid arsole ring, while the cyclopentane moiety in 1&#8201;a was much less distorted.

         <title>Revealing the Effect of Surface Composition on Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes Supported Pt&#8208;Fe Alloy Electrocatalysts for Methanol Oxidation Performance</title>

Electrocatalytic methanol oxidation: This work have been successfully fabricated property Pt&#8722;Fe alloy supported on the MWCNTs featuring nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon via co&#8208;engineering of the surface composition and electronic structure. The resulting structure is a highly active methanol oxidation catalyst.







Abstract
The designs of efficient and inexpensive Pt&#8208;based catalysts for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) are essential to boost the commercialization of direct methanol fuel cells. Here, the highly catalytic performance PtFe alloys supported on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) decorating nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NC) have been successfully prepared via co&#8208;engineering of the surface composition and electronic structure. The Pt1Fe3@NC/MWCNTs catalyst with moderate Fe3+ feeding content (0.86&#8197;mA/mgPt) exhibits 2.26&#8208;fold enhancement in MOR mass activity compared to pristine Pt/C catalyst (0.38&#8197;mA/mgPt). Furthermore, the CO oxidation initial potential of Pt1Fe3@NC/MWCNTs catalyst is lower relative to Pt/C catalyst (0.71&#8197;V and 0.80&#8197;V). Benefited from the optimal surface compositions, the anti&#8208;corrosion ability of MWCNT, strong electron interaction between PtFe alloys and MWCNTs and the N&#8208;doped carbon (NC) layer, the Pt1Fe3@NC/MWCNTs catalyst presents an improved MOR performance and anti&#8208;CO poisoning ability. This study would open up new perspective for designing efficient electrocatalysts for the DMFCs field.

         <title>Templated Generation of a Bcl&#8208;xL Inhibitor by Isomer&#8208;Free SPAAC Based on Azacyclonon&#8208;5&#8208;yne</title>

Less strain, more gain. We present Fmoc&#8208;ACN as the first cyclononyne suitable for isomer&#8208;free strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (iSPAAC). We demonstrate its use for the rational design and protein&#8208;templated formation of a low&#8208;micromolar inhibitor of protein&#8211;protein interactions mediated by Bcl&#8208;xL. The lower intrinsic reactivity of cyclononynes as compared to cyclooctynes facilitated higher template effects and rate accelerations in the aqueous environment.







Abstract
High&#8208;affinity inhibitors of large protein&#8211;protein interactions often have a high molecular weight, which compromises their cell permeability and oral bioavailability. We recently presented isomer&#8208;free, strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (iSPAAC) as a method by which to generate large, chemically uniform bioactive molecules inside living cells from two smaller components with higher cell permeability. Here, we present the synthesis of Fmoc&#8208;protected azacyclonon&#8208;5&#8208;yne (Fmoc&#8208;ACN) as the first cyclononyne suitable for iSPAAC. ACN facilitated the structure&#8208;guided development of a single&#8208;digit micromolar triazole inhibitor of the protein&#8211;protein interaction domain of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl&#8208;xL. Inhibitor formation in aqueous buffer at 37&#8201;&#176;C, templated by the target protein Bcl&#8208;xL, proceeded 2800 times faster than the reaction between Fmoc&#8208;ACN and benzyl azide under standard conditions in acetonitrile. Our data demonstrate the utility of cyclononynes for iSPAAC and their potential for achieving vastly accelerated templated reactions in aqueous environments.

From amine to imine more easily: A fan&#8208;like hollow N&#8208;doped C&#8208;coated AgCl/Pd heterostructure has been synthesized by pyrolysis of a AgCl/Pd@Bim precursor under argon. The interface effect of the AgCl/Pd heterostructure efficiently regulates the electronic structure and accelerates the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers, leading to excellent photocatalytic activity toward oxidative coupling of amine to imine.







Abstract
Rationally designing interface structure to modulate the electronic structure of a photocatalyst is an efficient strategy to facilitate the separation and migration of photogenerated charge carriers and improve photocatalytic activity. In this work, a AgCl/Pd heterostructure encapsulated by N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (AgCl/Pd@N&#8722;C) with a fan&#8208;like morphology assembled hollow tubes was synthesized by pyrolysis of a AgCl/Pd@Bim precursor. The unique interface structure not only increases the number of photogenerated charge carriers, but also provides an effective channel for the separation of electrons and holes, which have been proved by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. As expected, the obtained AgCl/Pd&#8208;3@N&#8722;C exhibited greatly enhanced conversion efficiency and recyclability toward the photocatalytic oxidative coupling of amine under blue&#8208;light irradiation.

         <title>Intracellular Assembly of Interacting Enzymes Yields Highly&#8208;Active Nanoparticles for Flow Biocatalysis</title>

All&#8208;enzyme hydrogel nanoparticles of controlled arrangements of interacting enzymes can be produced intracellularly, purified from crude bacterial lysates in a one&#8208;step process, and used as stable materials in flow&#8208;through biocatalysis.







Abstract
All&#8208;enzyme hydrogel (AEH) particles with a hydrodynamic diameter of up to 120&#8197;nm were produced intracellularly with an Escherichia coli&#8208;based in&#8197;vivo system. The inCell&#8208;AEH nanoparticles were generated from polycistronic vectors enabling simultaneous expression of two interacting enzymes, the Lactobacillus brevis alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and the Bacillus subtilis glucose&#8208;1&#8208;dehydrogenase (GDH), fused with a SpyCatcher or SpyTag, respectively. Formation of inCell&#8208;AEH was analyzed by dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy. Using the stereoselective two&#8208;step reduction of a prochiral diketone substrate, we show that the inCell&#8208;AEH approach can be advantageously used in whole&#8208;cell flow biocatalysis, by which flow reactors could be operated for &gt;4&#8197;days under constant substrate perfusion. More importantly, the inCell&#8208;AEH concept enables the recovery of efficient catalyst materials for stable flow bioreactors in a simple and economical one&#8208;step procedure from crude bacterial lysates. We believe that our method will contribute to further optimization of sustainable biocatalytic processes.

&lt;p&gt;All-enzyme hydrogel (AEH) particles with a hydrodynamic diameter of up to 120&#8197;nm were produced intracellularly with an &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;-based in&#8197;vivo system. The inCell-AEH nanoparticles were generated from polycistronic vectors enabling simultaneous expression of two interacting enzymes, the &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus brevis&lt;/i&gt; alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and the &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; glucose-1-dehydrogenase (GDH), fused with a SpyCatcher or SpyTag, respectively. Formation of inCell-AEH was analyzed by dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy. Using the stereoselective two-step reduction of a prochiral diketone substrate, we show that the inCell-AEH approach can be advantageously used in whole-cell flow biocatalysis, by which flow reactors could be operated for &amp;gt;4&#8197;days under constant substrate perfusion. More importantly, the inCell-AEH concept enables the recovery of efficient catalyst materials for stable flow bioreactors in a simple and economical one-step procedure from crude bacterial lysates. We believe that our method will contribute to further optimization of sustainable biocatalytic processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Characterization of a Novel Cytochrome Involved in Geobacter sulfurreducens&#8217; Electron Harvesting Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 66, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The periplasmic cytochrome GSU2515 is crucial for the electron harvesting pathways of Geobacter sulfurreducens, a suitable bacterium to apply in microbial electrosynthesis technologies. The biophysical characterization of GSU2515 together with biomolecular interactions and electron transfer experiments highlighted how electrons are conducted within the periplasm and pave the way for understanding the bacterium's electron harvesting pathways.







Abstract
Electron harvesting bacteria are key targets to develop microbial electrosynthesis technologies, which are valid alternatives for the production of value&#8208;added compounds without utilization of fossil fuels. Geobacter sulfurreducens, that is capable of donating and accepting electrons from electrodes, is one of the most promising electroactive bacteria. Its electron transfer mechanisms to electrodes have been progressively elucidated, however the electron harvesting pathways are still poorly understood. Previous studies showed that the periplasmic cytochromes PccH and GSU2515 are overexpressed in current&#8208;consuming G. sulfurreducens biofilms. PccH was characterized, though no putative partners have been identified. In this work, GSU2515 was characterized by complementary biophysical techniques and in silico simulations using the AlphaFold neural network. GSU2515 is a low&#8208;spin monoheme cytochrome with a disordered N&#8208;terminal region and an &#945;&#8208;helical C&#8208;terminal domain harboring the heme group. The cytochrome undergoes a redox&#8208;linked heme axial ligand switch, with Met91 and His94 as distal axial ligands in the reduced and oxidized states, respectively. The reduction potential of the cytochrome is negative and modulated by the pH in the physiological range: &#8722;78&#8197;mV at pH&#8197;6 and &#8722;113&#8197;mV at pH&#8197;7. Such pH&#8208;dependence coupled to the redox&#8208;linked switch of the axial ligand allows the cytochrome to drive a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer step that is crucial to confer directionality to the respiratory chain. Biomolecular interactions and electron transfer experiments indicated that GSU2515 and PccH form a redox complex. Overall, the data obtained highlight for the first time how periplasmic proteins bridge the electron transfer between the outer and inner membrane in the electron harvesting pathways of G. sulfurreducens.

         <title>Solution Structure of a Lanthanide&#8208;binding DNA Aptamer Determined Using High Quality pseudocontact shift restraints</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 66, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;range paramagnetic NMR restraints remain largely inaccessible for nucleic acid systems. In this contribution we demonstrate that such restraints can be generated by a lanthanide ion bound to an intrinsic site provided by a DNA aptamer. By solving the 3D structure of the aptamer&#8208;Ln3+ complex we provide the structural basis for the introduction of similar sites into other DNA systems.







Abstract
In this contribution we report the high&#8208;resolution NMR structure of a recently identified lanthanide&#8208;binding aptamer (LnA). We demonstrate that the rigid lanthanide binding by LnA allows for the measurement of anisotropic paramagnetic NMR restraints which to date remain largely inaccessible for nucleic acids. One type of such restraints &#8208; pseudocontact shifts (PCS) induced by four different paramagnetic lanthanides &#8208; was extensively used throughout the current structure determination study and the measured PCS turned out to be exceptionally well reproduced by the final aptamer structure. This finding opens the perspective for a broader application of paramagnetic effects in NMR studies of nucleic acids through the transplantation of the binding site found in LnA into other DNA/RNA systems.

         <title>Ultrathin Niobate Nanosheet Assembly with Au NPs and CdS QDs as a Highly Efficient Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 66, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An excellent 2D photocatalyst was synthesized by loading Au nanoparticles and CdS quantum dots on niobate nanosheets. This CdS/Au/HNb3O8 photocatalyst not only increased the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate by 254 times compared with the pure niobate nanosheet, but also showed outstanding photocatalytic performance for oxidative self&#8208;coupling of benzylamine and degradation of organic dyes.







Abstract
Niobate nanosheets have aroused widespread interest in recent years for their prospects in catalysis. The exploration of 2D niobate catalysis with stable and efficient properties is still the focus in chemistry and materials science. Herein, the successful fabrication of 2D CdS/Au/HNb3O8 catalyst is demonstrated which revealed efficient photocatalytic properties in H2 evolution, oxidative self&#8208;coupling of amines to imines, and degradation of dyes. Especially the assembled architecture can give a rate of 5.85&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 of photocatalytic H2 evolution, an &#8764;254&#8208;fold enhancement, compared with bare HNb3O8 nanosheets under identical conditions. In accordance with density functional theory (DFT) and X&#8208;ray adsorption fine structure (XAFS) analyses, the vast improvements are benefited from efficient migration and separation of charge carriers. Besides, the surface plasma resonance (SPR) effect of Au NPs enhances the light harvesting capacity and boosts the generation of hot electrons, efficiently improving the visible&#8208;light absorption.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Tailoring To Construct Ultrathin Bi2O2O/Bi2O2(OH)(NO3) Nanosheets: Interactive CO2RR Promotion and Bismuth&#8208;Oxygen Moiety Preservation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 66, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Special morphology: Ultrathin Bi2O2O surface/Bi2O2(OH)(NO3) substrate nanosheets were prepared through in&#8208;situ interlamellar hydrogen&#8208;bond tailoring strategies. The special morphology not only helps to facilitate production of the Bi2O2CO3 intermediate, but also enhances the resistance of Bi&#8722;O moieties to being reduced to promote formate production from CO2RR.







Abstract
Bismuth&#8211;oxygen moieties are beneficial for high&#8208;efficiency electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) to produce formate; however, preserving bismuth&#8208;oxygen moieties while applying a cathodic potential is challenging. This work reports the preparation of ultrathin Bi2O2O/Bi2O2(OH)(NO3) nanosheets (BiON&#8208;uts) by in&#8208;situ tailoring of hydrogen bonds in a Bi2O2(OH)(NO3) precursor. The BiON&#8208;uts exhibits a formate faradaic efficiency of 98&#8201;% with higher partial current density than that of most reported bismuth&#8208;based catalysts. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the ultrathin nanosheet morphology facilitates ion&#8208;exchange between BiON&#8208;uts and the electrolyte to produce Bi2O2CO3 as intermediate, and adsorption of CO2 with surface Bi2O2O. DFT calculations reveal that the rate&#8208;limiting first electron transfer is effectively improved by the high electron affinity of Bi2O2CO3. More importantly, high&#8208;efficiency CO2RR in turn protects the bismuth&#8211;oxygen moieties from being reduced and thus helps to maintain the excellent CO2RR activity. This work offers an interactive mechanism of CO2RR promotion and bismuth&#8211;oxygen moiety preservation, opening up new opportunities for developing high&#8208;performance catalysts.

DFT calculations reveal that the rate-limiting first electron transfer is effectively improved by the high electron affinity of Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. More importantly, high-efficiency CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR in turn protects the bismuth&#8211;oxygen moieties from being reduced and thus helps to maintain the excellent CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR activity. This work offers an interactive mechanism of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR promotion and bismuth&#8211;oxygen moiety preservation, opening up new opportunities for developing high-performance catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Extremely Stable Interprotein Tetrahedral Hg(Cys)4 Core Forms in the Zinc Hook Domain of Rad50 Protein at Physiological pH</title>

HgII toxicity: HgII targets the intermolecular ZnII&#8208;binding site of DNA binding protein Rad50 to form the strongest metal complex in the living world and jeopardize the DNA repair mechanism.







Abstract
In nature, thiolate&#8208;based systems are the primary targets of divalent mercury (HgII) toxicity. The formation of Hg(Cys)x cores in catalytic and structural protein centers mediates mercury's toxic effects and ultimately leads to cellular damage. Multiple studies have revealed distinct HgII&#8208;thiolate coordination preferences, among which linear HgII complexes are the most commonly observed in solution at physiological pH. Trigonal or tetrahedral geometries are formed at basic pH or in tight intraprotein Cys&#8208;rich metal sites. So far, no interprotein tetrahedral HgII complex formed at neutral pH has been reported. Rad50 protein is a part of the multiprotein MRN complex, a major player in DNA damage&#8208;repair processes. Its central region consists of a conserved CXXC motif that enables dimerization of two Rad50 molecules by coordinating ZnII. Dimerized motifs form a unique interprotein zinc hook domain (Hk) that is critical for the biological activity of the MRN. Using a series of length&#8208;differentiated peptide models of the Pyrococcus furiosus zinc hook domain, we investigated its interaction with HgII. Using UV&#8208;Vis, CD, PAC, and 199Hg&#8197;NMR spectroscopies as well as anisotropy decay, we discovered that all Rad50 fragments preferentially form homodimeric Hg(Hk)2 species with a distorted tetrahedral HgS4 coordination environment at physiological pH; this is the first example of an interprotein mercury site displaying tetrahedral geometry in solution. At higher HgII content, monomeric HgHk complexes with linear geometry are formed. The Hg(Cys)4 core of Rad50 is extremely stable and does not compete with cyanides, NAC, or DTT. Applying ITC, we found that the stability constant of the Rad50 Hg(Hk)2 complex is approximately three orders of magnitude higher than those of the strongest HgII complexes known to date.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Oxidizing Ruthenium(II) Complexes with Enhanced Visible&#8208;Light Absorption and G&#8208;quadruplex DNA Binding Abilities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 66, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru(II) complexes that gather strong photo&#8208;oxidizing power and enhanced visible&#8208;light absorption were prepared with the highly conjugated dph or bpph ligands. Biolayer interferometry and NCI Surface analyses show their avid binding to G&#8208;quadruplex DNA particularly arising from interaction within the G&#8208;quadruplex groove.







Abstract
Photosensitizers that gather high photo&#8208;oxidizing power and strong visible&#8208;light absorption are of great interest in the development of new photo&#8208;chemotherapeutics. Indeed, such compounds constitute attractive candidates for the design of type I photosensitizers that are not dependent on the presence of oxygen. In this paper, we report on the synthesis and studies of new ruthenium(II) complexes that display strong visible&#8208;light absorption and can oxidize guanine residues under visible&#8208;light irradiation, as evidenced by nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The reported compounds also tightly bind to G&#8208;quadruplex DNA structures from the human telomeric sequence (TTAGGG repeat). The kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the interaction of these Ru(II) complexes with G&#8208;quadruplex and duplex DNA were studied thanks to luminescence titrations and bio&#8208;layer interferometry measurements, which revealed higher affinities towards the non&#8208;canonical G&#8208;quadruplex architecture. Docking experiments and non&#8208;covalent ionic analysis allowed us to gain information on the mode and the strength of the interaction of the compounds towards G&#8208;quadruplex and duplex DNA. The different studies emphasize the substantial influence of the position and the number of non&#8208;chelating nitrogen atoms on the interaction with both types of DNA secondary structures.

The electrochemical synthesis of fluorinated allyl silanes and boronates is disclosed. Through the electrogeneration of boryl and silyl radical a panel of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl or &#945;&#8208;difluoromethylstyrenes was converted into the corresponding allyl silanes and boronates in good to excellent yields (64&#8197;examples, from 31&#8201;% to 95&#8201;% yield). A scale up of the reactions under continuous flow was showcased and the synthetic utility of these building blocks was highlighted through versatile transformations.







Abstract
The electrochemical synthesis of fluorinated allyl silanes and boronates was disclosed. The addition of electrogenerated boryl or silyl radicals onto many &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl or &#945;&#8208;difluoromethylstyrenes in an undivided cell allowed the formation of a large panel of synthetically useful gem&#8208;difluoro and &#947;&#8208;fluoroallyl boronates and silanes (64&#8197;examples, from 31&#8201;% to 95&#8201;% yield). In addition, a scale up of the reactions under continuous flow was showcased using an electrochemical reactor with promising volumetric productivity (688&#8197;g.L&#8722;1.h&#8722;1 and 496&#8197;g.L&#8722;1.h&#8722;1). Moreover, the synthetic utility of these building blocks was highlighted through versatile transformations. Finally, plausible reaction mechanisms were suggested to explain the formation of the products.

Photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;based batteries (PALBs) can directly store solar energy or output for circuit load by converting into electric energy without any intermediate. The photogenerated electrons and holes can promote the reduction and oxidation reaction in PALBs under light illumination, which will greatly reduce the overpotential in charge and discharge process. These PALBs which will provide a more competitive strategy for the full use of solar energy are discussed in the Review by Ye, He, Meng, Wang and colleagues (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202104).

         <title>Frontispiece: Fast Cysteine Bioconjugation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 66, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this contribution, we attempt to define fast cysteine bioconjugation, in contrast to the traditional cysteine modifying reactions that are kinetically slow. A fast cysteine conjugation reaction can allow facile quantitative labeling of proteins with minimized side reactions and much simplified purification. A substantial collection of novel reactions have been developed towards this end with some displaying reaction rates over 103&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. This Concept article discusses the design principles and reaction mechanisms, with reaction rate constants summarized to provide valuable reference data for further development of fast and highly efficient protein conjugation reactions. More information can be found in the Concept article by J. Gao and F.&#8208;J. Chen. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201843)

         <dc:description>
HgII interacting with a naturally ZnII&#8208;containing Rad50 protein interface yields HgS4 species, the strongest metal&#8211;protein interaction known to date. It also introduces the novel manifestation of HgII mechanism of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Furthermore, the substitution of naturally occurring ZnII possibly has an impact on the quaternary structure and the protein assembly process, thus disrupting the DNA&#8208;repair mechanisms that engage the Mre11&#8211;Rad50 complex. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;Kr&#281;&#380;el and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202738).

Messages from the cell: The cover picture honors the sensitivity of nitroxide labels combined with EPR spectroscopy in reporting on protein structure dynamics inside bacterial cells. We have demonstrated, in particular, that NarJ protein can be investigated at room temperature within 15&#8197;minutes, conditions that allow the preservation of both cell integrity and the activity of the protein under investigation.

Motivated by the electron transport chain in natural photosynthesis, we propose a strategy to construct an electron transport channel in a model artificial photocatalyst, C3N4&#8722;TiO2 (BN&#8722;BR/CN) by electron transport layer engineering through a homophase junction (BN&#8722;BR). The electrons generated in CN under visible light can be contiunuously extracted and migrated along CN,BR TiO2, and BN TiO2, resulting in the synergistic optimization of photoabsorption and charge separation, and boosting H2 evolution. More information can be found in the Research Article by J. Zhang and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202007).

         <title>Recent Advances in the Research of Photo&#8208;Assisted Lithium&#8208;Based Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 66, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;based batteries (PALBs) are widely attracting researchers because they can directly convert solar energy into electric energy for storage or output without any intermediate. Highly active photogenerated carriers can enhance the battery reaction and reduce the overpotential in charge and discharge process to increase the energy efficiency. The development of various PALBs is discussed under the aspects of configuration, mechanism, electrodes design and performance.







Abstract
The application of solar energy is crucial for alleviating the energy crisis and achieving sustainable development. In recent years, photo&#8208;assisted rechargeable batteries have attracted researchers because they can directly convert and store solar energy in the batteries. And it also can be used like a normal battery without light illumination. Photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;based batteries have received more attention than other energy storage systems due to their higher energy density and relatively mature development. This Review focuses on the design of various photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;based batteries including Li&#8208;ion, Li&#8208;S, Li&#8208;O2, Li&#8208;CO2 and Li&#8208;I batteries, as well as the working mechanism of photoelectrodes in these battery systems. The basic understanding and challenge of photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;based batteries are also discussed. At last, perspectives for the photoelectrode development are provided in the summary to advance photo&#8208;assisted energy storage systems.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Photo-assisted lithium-based batteries&lt;/b&gt; (PALBs) are widely attracting researchers because they can directly convert solar energy into electric energy for storage or output without any intermediate. Highly active photogenerated carriers can enhance the battery reaction and reduce the overpotential in charge and discharge process to increase the energy efficiency. The development of various PALBs is discussed under the aspects of configuration, mechanism, electrodes design and performance.

A 2D view of photocatalysis: This review discusses 2D materials with excellent performance in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, summarizes existing synthetic strategies, and highlights promising batch preparation strategies. Second, our work summarizes the existing applications and modification strategies of various 2D materials in the field of CO2 emission reduction.







Abstract
Currently, the excessive consumption of fossil fuels is accompanied by massive emissions of CO2, leading to severe energy shortages and intensified global warming. It is of great significance to develop and use renewable clean energy while reducing the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. Photocatalytic technology is a promising strategy for carbon dioxide conversion. Clearly, the achievement of the above goals largely depends on the design and construction of catalysts. This review is mainly focused on the application of 2D materials for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The contribution of synthetic strategies to their structure and performance is emphasized. Finally, the current challenges, and prospects of 2D materials for photoreduction of CO2 with high efficiency, even for practical applications are discussed. It is hoped that this review can provide some guidance for the rational design, controllable synthesis of 2D materials, and their application for efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

         <title>Fluorescent Nanoassemblies in Water Exhibiting Tunable LCST Behavior and Responsive Light Harvesting Ability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Responsive fluorescent nanomaterials have been received considerable attention in recent years. In this work, we synthesized a bola&#8208;type amphiphilic molecule CSO, which contains a hydrophobic cyanostilbene core and hydrophilic oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) coils at both sides. The cyanostilbene group is aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) active, while the OEG coils are thermo&#8208;responsive. As a result, the CSO molecules can self&#8208;assemble into blue&#8208;fluorescent nanoassemblies with lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior in aqueous media. It is noteworthy that the LCST behavior can be reversibly regulated with changes in concentration and the introduction of K+. Intriguingly, fluorescence of CSO assembly shows a blue&#8208;shift upon heating. Finally, by employing CSO as a light capturing antenna and energy donor, an artificial light harvesting system with tunable emission and thermo&#8208;responsive characteristics was fabricated. Our study not only demonstrates an integrated approach to create responsive fluorescent nanomaterials, but also shows great potential for producing luminescent materials and mimicking light harvesting in nature.</dc:description>

         <title>TEMPO&#8208;Modified Polymethacrylates as Mediators in Electrosynthesis &#8208; Influence of the Molecular Weight on Redox Properties and Electrocatalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Homogeneous catalysts (&#8220;mediators&#8221;) are frequently employed in organic electrosynthesis to control selectivity. Despite their advantages, they can have a negative influence on the overall energy and mass balance if used only once or recycled inefficiently. Polymediators are soluble redox&#8208;active polymers applicable as electrocatalysts, enabling recovery by dialysis or membrane filtration. Using anodic alcohol oxidation as an example, we have demonstrated that TEMPO&#8208;modified polymethacrylates (TPMA) can act as efficient and recyclable catalysts. In the present work, the influence of the molecular size on the redox properties and the catalytic activity was carefully elaborated using a series of TPMAs with well&#8208;defined molecular weight distributions. Cyclic voltammetry studies show that the polymer chain length has a pronounced impact on the key&#8208;properties. Together with preparative&#8208;scale electrolysis experiments, an optimum size range was identified for polymediator&#8208;guided sustainable reaction control.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organosilanes play essential roles in many important research areas. The use of readily available chlorosilanes to catalytically access these compounds is synthetically appealing but remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling reaction has recently emerged as a promising protocol to arrive at this goal. This strategy allows the chlorosilanes to be coupled with various carbon electrophiles under mild conditions. These reactions afford organosilanes with improved molecular diversity, structural complexity, and functional group compatibility. This concept manuscript summarizes the recent advance on nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive C&#8211;Si couplings of chlorosilanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Electrochemical Synthesis of 2,3&#8208;Disubstituted Quinoline N&#8208;oxides by Cathodic Reduction of Nitro Arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of electric current in synthetic organic chemistry offers a sustainable tool for the selective reductive synthesis of quinoline N&#8208;oxides starting from easily accessible nitro compounds. The reported method employs mild and reagent&#8208;free conditions, a simple undivided cell, and constant current electrolysis set&#8208;up which provides conversion with a high atom economy. The synthesis of 29 differently substituted quinoline N&#8208;oxides was successfully performed in up to 90% yield.

         <title>Oxidative Desymmetrization Enables the Concise Synthesis of a trans&#8208;Cyclooctene Linker for Bioorthogonal Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal cleavage of trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) linkers triggered by a click reaction with tetrazines has enabled new concepts in chemical biology and in vivo chemistry. We introduce a new dioxolane&#8208;fused cleavable TCO linker (dcTCO) with high stability and reduced lipophilicity that can be prepared in five steps and demonstrate its application in bioorthogonal prodrug activation, achieving a remarkable &gt;1000&#8208;fold &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; in cytotoxicity.







Abstract
Modified trans&#8208;cyclooctenes (TCO) are capable of highly efficient molecular manipulations in biological environments, driven by the bioorthogonal reaction with tetrazines (Tz). The development of click&#8208;cleavable TCO has fueled the field of in&#8197;vivo chemistry and enabled the design of therapeutic strategies that have already started to enter the clinic. A key element for most of these approaches is the implementation of a cleavable TCO linker. So far, only one member of this class has been developed, a compound that requires a high synthetic effort, mainly to fulfill the multilayered demands on its chemical structure. To tackle this limitation, we developed a dioxolane&#8208;fused cleavable TCO linker (dcTCO) that can be prepared in only five steps by applying an oxidative desymmetrization to achieve diastereoselective introduction of the required functionalities. Based on investigation of the structure, reaction kinetics, stability, and hydrophilicity of dcTCO, we demonstrate its bioorthogonal application in the design of a caged prodrug that can be activated by in&#8208;situ Tz&#8208;triggered cleavage to achieve a remarkable &gt;1000&#8208;fold increase in cytotoxicity.

         <title>Surface Modification, Topographic Design and Applications of Superhydrophobic Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superhydrophobic surfaces with expanded wetting behaviors like tunable adhesion, hybrid surface hydrophobicity and smart hydrophobic switching, have attracted increasing attention due to their broad applications. This review mainly focuses on recent advances in surface modification, topographic design and the application of superhydrophobic systems.







Abstract
Superhydrophobic surfaces with expanded wetting behaviors, like tunable adhesion, hybrid surface hydrophobicity and smart hydrophobic switching have attracted increasing attention due to their broad applications. Herein, the construction methods, mechanisms and advanced applications of special superhydrophobicity are reviewed, and hydro/superhydrophobic modifications are categorized and discussed based on their surface chemistry, and topographic design. The formation and maintenance of special superhydrophobicity in the metastable state are also examined and explored. In addition, particular attention is paid to the use of special wettability in various applications, such as membrane distillation, droplet&#8208;based electricity generators and anti&#8208;fogging surfaces. Finally, the challenges for practical applications and future research directions are discussed.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Diaryl Quaternary Centers by Rh(II)/Xantphos Catalyzed Relay C&#8722;H Functionalization and Allylic Alkylation</title>

         <dc:description>
A dirhodium(II)/Xantphos catalyzed three&#8208;component reaction of N, N&#8208;disubstituted anilines, &#945;&#8208;diazo esters, and allylic compounds was developed, affording various aniline derivatives with diaryl allylic quaternary centers in good yields under mild conditions. The reaction proceeds via para C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization of aniline derivatives by Rh(II)&#8208;carbenoid intermediate, and subsequent [Rh2]/Xantphos&#8208;catalyzed allylic alkylation of the resulting &#945;, &#945;&#8208;diarylacetate intermediate.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component reaction of N, N&#8208;disubstituted aniline, &#945;&#8208;diazo ester, and an allylic electrophile has been realized by [Rh(II)]2/Xantphos catalysis, providing a direct access to various aniline derivatives bearing diaryl allylic quaternary centers in good yields. The synthetic utility of this protocol was demonstrated by facile derivatization of the products for preparation of biologically relevant molecules and structural scaffolds, which offers a high potential for increasing the molecular diversity. Mechanistic studies identified &#945;, &#945;&#8208;diarylacetate species as an active intermediate, thereby revealing the presence of a C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization of aniline derivatives/allylic alkylation cascade in this attractive catalytic transformation.

New&#8208;to&#8208;Nature D&#8208;galactosyl lysophospholipids were rationally designed and synthesized to act as artificial substrates and non&#8208;ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases, which are validated drug targets for deadly human diseases including cancers, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and SARS&#8208;COVID&#8208;2 infection. Rational Design and Synthesis of D&#8208;galactosyl Lysophospholipids as Selective Substrates and non&#8208;ATP&#8208;competitive Inhibitors of Phosphatidylinositol Phosphate Kinases (X. Huang, J. Hu et&#8197;al.)







Abstract
Phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases (PIPKs) produce lipid signaling molecules and have been attracting increasing attention as drug targets for cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and viral infection. Given the potential cross&#8208;inhibition of kinases and other ATP&#8208;utilizing enzymes by ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors, targeting the unique lipid substrate binding site represents a superior strategy for PIPK inhibition. Here, by taking advantage of the nearly identical stereochemistry between myo&#8208;inositol and D&#8208;galactose, we designed and synthesized a panel of D&#8208;galactosyl lysophospholipids, one of which was found to be a selective substrate of phosphatidylinositol 4&#8208;phosphate 5&#8208;kinase. Derivatization of this compound led to the discovery of a human PIKfyve inhibitor with an apparent IC50 of 6.2&#8197;&#956;M, which significantly potentiated the inhibitory effect of Apilimod, an ATP&#8208;competitive PIKfyve inhibitor under clinical trials against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our results provide the proof of concept that D&#8208;galactose&#8208;based phosphoinositide mimetics can be developed into artificial substrates and new inhibitors of PIPKs.

         <title>Size Selectivity in Heterolanthanide Molecular Complexes with a Ditopic Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A size selectivity in the coordination of different lanthanides ions to the two donor sites of the ditopic pyterpyNO ligand has been evidenced in heteronuclear complexes of formula RE2RE*2(tta)12(pyterpyNO)2, where smaller (larger) ions normally display a higher affinity for the eight (nine)&#8208;coordinated oxygen (nitrogen) site. The present results, obtained in solution and in the solid state with a multi&#8208;technique approach (X&#8208;ray diffraction, 19F&#8197;NMR, magnetometry and photoluminescence), are independent of the employed synthetic route.







Abstract
The similar reactivity of lanthanides generally leads to statistically populated polynuclear complexes, making the rational design of ordered hetero&#8208;lanthanide compounds extremely challenging. Here we report on the site selectivity in hetero&#8208;lanthanide tetranuclear complexes afforded by the relatively simple ditopic pyterpyNO ligand (4&#8217;&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridil)&#8208;2,2&#8217;:6&#8217;,2&#8221;&#8208;terpyridine N&#8208;oxide). The sequential room temperature reaction of RE2(tta)6(pyterpyNO)2 (where RE=Y, (1); Eu, (2), Dy, (3) Htta=2&#8208;thenoyltrifluoroacetone) with La(tta)3dme (dme=dimethoxyethane) yielded Y2La2(tta)12(pyterpyNO)2 (4), Dy2La2(tta)12(pyterpyNO)2 (5) and Eu2La2(tta)12(pyterpyNO)2 (6). Single crystals X&#8208;ray diffraction studies showed that 4, 5 and 6 are isostructural, featuring a tetranuclear structure with two different metal coordination sites with coordination numbers 8 (CN8) and 9 (CN9). The two smaller cations are mainly bridged by the O&#8208;donor atoms of the NO groups of two pyterpyNO ligands (CN8), while the larger lanthanum centres are bound by a terpyridine unit (CN9). Size selectivity has been studied with structural and magnetic studies in the solid state and through 19F&#8197;NMR and photoluminescence studies in solution, showing a direct dependence on the difference of ionic radii of the ions and yielding a 91&#8201;% selectivity for 4. Furthermore, 19F&#8197;NMR, X&#8208;ray and PL studies pointed out that the nature of the product is independent from the synthetic route for compound Eu2Y2(tta)12(pyterpyNO)2 (7), keeping the ion selectivity also for a self&#8208;assembly reaction. Unexpectedly, these studies have evidenced that selectivity is not exclusively governed by electrostatic interactions related to size dimensions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A size selectivity in&lt;/b&gt; the coordination of different lanthanides ions to the two donor sites of the ditopic pyterpyNO ligand has been evidenced in heteronuclear complexes of formula RE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RE*&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(tta)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;(pyterpyNO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where smaller (larger) ions normally display a higher affinity for the eight (nine)-coordinated oxygen (nitrogen) site. The present results, obtained in solution and in the solid state with a multi-technique approach (X-ray diffraction, &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F&#8197;NMR, magnetometry and photoluminescence), are independent of the employed synthetic route.

         <title>Activation of Ge&#8722;H and Sn&#8722;H Bonds with N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes and a Cyclic (Alkyl)(amino)carbene</title>

Insertion of cAACMe into E&#8722;H bonds of EH2R2 (E=Ge, R=Mes; E=Sn, R=Me) to yield cAACMeH&#8722;EHR2 and the dehydrogenative coupling of EH2R2 using N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes are reported.







Abstract
A study of the reactivity of several N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and the cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene 1&#8208;(2,6&#8208;di&#8208;iso&#8208;propylphenyl)&#8208;3,3,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (cAACMe) with the group 14 hydrides GeH2Mes2 and SnH2Me2 (Me=CH3, Mes=1,3,5&#8208;(CH3)3C6H2) is presented. The reaction of GeH2Mes2 with cAACMe led to the insertion of cAACMe into one Ge&#8722;H bond to give cAACMeH&#8722;GeHMes2 (1). If 1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (Me2ImMe) was used as the carbene, NHC&#8208;mediated dehydrogenative coupling occurred, which led to the NHC&#8208;stabilized germylene Me2ImMe&#8901;GeMes2 (2). The reaction of SnH2Me2 with cAACMe also afforded the insertion product cAACMeH&#8722;SnHMe2 (3), and reaction of two equivalents Me2ImMe with SnH2Me2 gave the NHC&#8208;stabilized stannylene Me2ImMe&#8901;SnMe2 (4). If the sterically more demanding NHCs Me2ImMe, 1,3&#8208;di&#8208;isopropyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (iPr2ImMe) and 1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;(2,6&#8208;di&#8208;isopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (Dipp2Im) were employed, selective formation of cyclic oligomers (SnMe2)n (5; n=5&#8211;8) in high yield was observed. These cyclic oligomers were also obtained from the controlled decomposition of cAACMeH&#8722;SnHMe2 (3).

         <title>Orthogonal Crosslinking: A Strategy to Generate Novel Protein Topology and Function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intrigued by diverse non&#8208;disulfide crosslinks occurring naturally in bacterial adhesins and pili domains, scientists have endeavored to expand crosslinker structures by using a variety of approaches and transpose this unusual topology to other robust protein scaffolds such as domain antibodies. This Concept summarizes recent advances in this fertile intersection of organic chemistry, biochemistry, and protein science.







Abstract
Compared to the disulfide bond, other naturally occurring intramolecular crosslinks have received little attention, presumably due to their rarity in the vast protein space. Here we presented examples of natural non&#8208;disulfide crosslinks, which we refer to as orthogonal crosslinks, emphasizing their effect on protein topology and function. We summarize recent efforts on expanding orthogonal crosslinks by using either the enzymes that catalyze protein circularization or the genetic code expansion strategy to add electrophilic amino acids site&#8208;specifically in proteins. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed, along with their applications to generate novel protein topology and function. In particular, we highlight our recent work on spontaneous orthogonal crosslinking, in which a carbamate&#8208;based crosslink was generated in&#8197;situ, and its applications in designing orthogonally crosslinked domain antibodies with their topology&#8208;mimicking bacterial adhesins.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Mediated Deoxygenative Radical Additions of Aromatic Acids to Vinyl Boronic Esters and gem&#8208;Diborylalkenes

Photoredox&#8208;mediate deoxygenation: In this work, we explore an efficient, general photoredox&#8208;mediated deoxygenated approach of abundant, simple, and commercially available carboxylic acids and vinyl boronic esters, which form the important &#946;&#8208;keto&#8208;borylalkanes. Additionally, a protocol of the late&#8208;stage functionalization of naturally occurring bioactive carboxylic acids and drugs has been developed using this approach.







Abstract
A new method to access &#946;&#8208;keto&#8208;gem&#8208;diborylalkanes, by direct deoxygenative radical addition of aromatic carboxylic acids to gem&#8208;dibortlalkenes, is described. The reaction proceeds under mild photoredox catalysis and involves the photochemical C&#8722;O bond activation of aromatic carboxylic acids in the presence of PPh3. It generates an acyl radical, which further undergoes an additional reaction with gem&#8208;diborylalkenes to form an &#945;&#8208;gem&#8208;diboryl alkyl radical intermediate, which then reduces to the corresponding anion, which after protonation, affords the &#946;&#8208;keto&#8208;gem&#8208;diborylalkane product. Moreover, the same scenario has been extended to the vinyl boronic esters, for example, gem&#8208;(Ar, Bpin)&#8208;alkenes, and gem&#8208;(Alkyl, Bpin)&#8208;alkenes. Importantly, this protocol provides a general platform for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of bio&#8208;active and drug molecules containing a carboxylic acid group.

         <title>Crystal Plane&#8208;Related Oxygen Evolution Activity of Single Hexagonal Co3O4 Spinel Particles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reac&#173;tion in alkaline electrolyte of hexagonal spinel Co3O4 nanoparticles derived using scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) is correlated with scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy images of the droplet landing sites. A unique way to deconvolute the intrinsic catalytic activity of individual crystal facets of the hexagonal Co3O4 spinel particle is demonstrated in terms of the turnover frequency (TOF) of surface Co atoms. The top surface expo&#173;sing 111 crystal planes displayed a thickness&#8208;dependent TOF with a TOF of about 100 s&#8208;1 at a potential of 1.8 V vs RHE and a particle thickness of 100 nm. The edge of the particle exposing (110) planes, however, showed an average TOF of 270 &#177; 68 s&#8208;1 at 1.8 V vs RHE and no correlation with particle thickness. However, the higher atomic density of Co atoms on the edge surface (2.5 times of the top) renders the overall catalytic activity of the edge planes significantly higher than that of the top planes. The use of a free&#8208;diffusing Os&#8208; complex in the alkaline electrolyte revealed the low electrical conductivity through individual particles which explains the thickness&#8208;dependent TOF of the top planes and could be a reason for the low activity of the top (111) planes.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Formation of Stable Neutral Radicals and Cations from [22]Smaragdyrin BF2 Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>meso&#8208;Trimesityl&#8208;substituted [20]smaragdyrin 6 was synthesized by p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction of 5&#8208;mesityldipyrromethane and 2,14&#8208;dibromodipyrrin in an improved yield of 63%. Unexpectedly, treatment of 6 with BF3&#183;OEt2 and triethylamine (TEA) gave stable radical 14, in which the BF2 unit is coordinated at the tripyrrin site, probably by ready release of hydrogen atom of [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex 17. Similar treatment of [22]smaragdyrin free base 4 produced 3. Neutral radical 14 was oxidized with AgSbF6 to stable antiaromatic cation 15 and was reduced with NaBH4 to 17, which was easily oxidized back to 14 in the air and rearranged to thermodynamically stable complex 3 upon treatment with BF3&#183;OEt2 and TEA. Further, the BF2 complex 3 was similarly oxidized to stable neutral radical 18 and stable cation 19 in a stepwise manner. This work demonstrates a rare ability of smaragdyrin BF2 complexes to exist as multiple redox states, particularly forming a stable neutral radical by facile release of a hydrogen atom.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8208;Terminal Lipidation of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Fusion Peptide Reinstates Superior Membrane Fusion Catalytic Ability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8208;associated coronavirus&#8208;2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) mediates a critical stage in infection, the fusion between viral and host membranes. The protein is categorized as a class I viral fusion protein and has two distinct cleavage sites that can be activated by proteases. The activation deploys the fusion peptide (FP) for insertion into the target cell membranes. Recent studies including our experiments showed that the FP was unable to modulate the kinetics of fusion at a low peptide&#8208;to&#8208;lipid ratio akin to the spike density at the viral surface. Therefore, we have modified the C&#8208;terminus of FP and attached a myristoyl chain (C&#8208;myr&#8208;FP) to restrict the C&#8208;terminus near to interface, bridge both membranes, and increase the effective local concentration. The lipidated FP (C&#8208;myr&#8208;FP) of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 greatly accelerates membrane fusion at a low peptide&#8208;to&#8208;lipid ratio as compared to the FP with no lipidation. Biophysical experiments suggest that C&#8208;myr&#8208;FP adopts a helical structure, perturbs the membrane interface, and increases water penetration to catalyze fusion. Scrambled peptide (C&#8208;myr&#8208;sFP) and truncated peptide (C&#8208;myr&#8208;8FP) couldn&#8217;t significantly catalyze the fusion suggesting the important role of myristoylation and the N&#8208;terminus. C&#8208;myr&#8208;FP enhances the murine coronavirus infection by promoting syncytia formation in L2 cells. The C&#8208;terminal lipidation of the FP may be a useful strategy to induce artificial fusion in biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Clickable Unnatural Sugars in the Unprotected and 1,6&#8208;Di&#8208;O&#8208;Acylated Forms for Metabolic Glycan Labeling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clickable unnatural sugars have been widely used in studying glycosylation in living systems via the metabolic glycan labelling (MGL) strategy. Partial protection of unnatural sugars by 1,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;acylation increases the labelling efficiency while avoiding the non&#8208;specific S&#8208;glyco&#8208;modification. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of a series of clickable unnatural sugars in both the unprotected and 1,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;acylated forms at the ten&#8208;gram scale. By evaluation of the labelling specificity, efficiency, and biocompatibility of various 1,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;acylated sugars for MGL in cell lines and living mice, we demonstrate that 1,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;propionylated unnatural sugars are optimal chemical reporters for glycan labelling. The synthetic routes developed in this work should facilitate the widespread use of MGL with no artificial S&#8208;glyco&#8208;modification for investigating the functional roles of glycans.</dc:description>

         <title>Emission and Luminescent Vapochromism Control of Octahedral Cu4I4 Complexes by Conformationally Restricted P,N Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New conformationally restricted P,N&#8208;ligand capable of the design of polynuclear copper(I) complexes was synthesized via the reaction of primary pyridylphosphine, paraformaldehyde, and benzhydrylamine. The reaction of the ligand with copper(I) iodide leads to the tetranuclear copper(I) complex with the octahedral type of copper&#8208;iodide core. Different orientation of coordination bonds of the ligands relative to the P,N2&#8208;heterocyclic fragments and to the Cu4I4 cores leads to the existence of two types of conformers of the complex with &#8220;compact&#8221; or &#8220;stretched&#8221; geometry of the Cu4I4 cluster. This lability of the complex allowed for obtaining two crystalline phases displaying green or red luminescence. The TDDFT computations along with XRD structural analysis gave a strong interpretation of the green emission belonging to the &#8220;compact&#8221; form of the complex and belonging of the red emission to the &#8220;stretched&#8221; form. Moreover, both crystalline phases demonstrate the strong vapochromic responses of luminescence on the vapors of wide range of solvents.</dc:description>

         <title>Clearing an ESKAPE pathogen in a model organism; a polypyridyl ruthenium(II) complex theranostic that treats a resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infection in Galleria mellonella.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In previous studies we have described the therapeutic action of luminescent dinuclear ruthenium(II) complexes based on the tetrapyridylphenazine, tpphz, bridging ligand on pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. Herein, the antimicrobial activity of the complex against pernicious Gram&#8208;negative ESKAPE pathogenic strains of Acinetobacter baumannii (AB12, AB16, AB184 and AB210) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA2017, PA_007_IMP and PA_004_CRCN) are reported. Estimated minimum inhibitory concentrations and minimum bactericidal concentrations for the complexes revealed the complex shows potent activity against all A. baumannii strains, in both glucose defined minimal media and standard nutrient rich Mueller&#8208;Hinton&#8208;II. Although the activity was lower in P. aureginosa, a moderately high potency was observed and retained in carbapenem&#8208;resistant strains. Optical microscopy showed that the compound is rapidly internalized by A. baumannii. As previous reports had revealed the complex exhibited no toxicity in Galleria Mellonella up to concentrations of 80 mg/kg, the ability to clear pathogenic infection within this model was explored. The pathogenic concentrations to the larvae for each bacterium were determined to be &#8805; 105 for AB184 and &#8805; 103 CFU/mL for PA2017. It was found a single dose of the compound totally cleared a pathogenic A. baumannii infection from all treated G. mellonella within 96 hours.

Herein, the antimicrobial activity of the complex against pernicious Gram-negative ESKAPE pathogenic strains of Acinetobacter baumannii (AB12, AB16, AB184 and AB210) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA2017, PA_007_IMP and PA_004_CRCN) are reported. Estimated minimum inhibitory concentrations and minimum bactericidal concentrations for the complexes revealed the complex shows potent activity against all A. baumannii strains, in both glucose defined minimal media and standard nutrient rich Mueller-Hinton-II. Although the activity was lower in P. aureginosa, a moderately high potency was observed and retained in carbapenem-resistant strains. Optical microscopy showed that the compound is rapidly internalized by A. baumannii. As previous reports had revealed the complex exhibited no toxicity in Galleria Mellonella up to concentrations of 80 mg/kg, the ability to clear pathogenic infection within this model was explored. The pathogenic concentrations to the larvae for each bacterium were determined to be &#8805; 105 for AB184 and &#8805; 103 CFU/mL for PA2017. It was found a single dose of the compound totally cleared a pathogenic A. baumannii infection from all treated G. mellonella within 96 hours. Uniquely, in these conditions thanks to the imaging properties of the complex the clearance of the bacteria within the hemolymph of G. mellonella could be directly visualized through both optical and transmission electron microscopy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ln&#8208;MOF Based Ratiometric Luminescent Sensor for the Detection of Potential COVID&#8208;19 Drugs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Countless people have been affected by the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic on a global scale. Favipiravir, has shown potential as an effective drug for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, attracting scientists&#8217; attention. However, overuse of Favipiravir easily leads to serious side effects, requiring real&#8208;time monitoring in body fluids. Given this, a new lanthanide metal organic framework (MOF) was prepared under solvothermal conditions from either Eu (Eu&#8208;MOF or (1)) or Tb (Tb&#8208;MOF or (2)) using the highly delocalized imidazoledicarboxylic acid linker H2L (H2L = 5&#8208;(4&#8208;(imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl) phenyl) isophthalic acid) and could be successfully applied to selective optical detection of Favipiravir. In this MOF framework, the organic linker H2L provides a high excitation energy transfer efficiency that can sensitize luminescence in lanthanides. In addition, through deliberate tuning of Eu/Tb molar ratio and reaction concentration in the lanthanide framework, ratiometric recyclable luminescent EuxTb1&#8208;x&#8208;MOF nanoparticles with open metal sites have been constructed, which present a high detection sensitivity (Ksv = 1&#215;107 [M&#8208;1], detection limit is 4.63 nM) for Favipiravir. The detection mechanism is discussed with the help of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations that sheds light over the selective sensing of Favipiravir over other related COVID&#8208;19 drug candidates. Finally, to explore the practical application of Favipiravir sensing, MOF based thin films have been used for visual detection of Favipiravir and recycled 5 times.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Roundabout of Four&#8208;Point&#8208;Star Tiles with the Core Arm Length of Three Half&#8208;Turns for 2D DNA Arrays</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tuning the roundabout of four&#8208;point&#8208;star tiles with the core arm length at three DNA half&#8208;turns, four types of tiles were designed with helper strands traveling via right turn, left turn, bridged longitudinal weaving, or U&#8208;turn for construction of 2D DNA nanostructures. Especially, the one&#8208;locus and/or dual&#8208;locus biotin/streptavidin labelling techniques were applied to judge the chirality of E&#8208;tiling tubes.







Abstract
By rationally adjusting the weaving modes of point&#8208;star tiles, the curvature inherent in the tiles can be changed, and various DNA nanostructures can be assembled, such as planar wireframe meshes, perforated wireframe tubes, and curved wireframe polyhedra. Based on the weaving and tiling architectures for traditional point&#8208;star tiles with the core arm length at two DNA half&#8208;turns, we improved the weaving modes of our newly reported four&#8208;point&#8208;star tiles with the core arm length at three half&#8208;turns to adjust their curvature and rigidity for assembling 2D arrays of DNA grids and tubes. Following our previous terms and methods to analyze the structural details of E&#8208;tiling tubes, we used the chiral indices (n,m) to describe the most abundant tube of typical assemblies; especially, we applied both one&#8208;locus and/or dual&#8208;locus biotin/streptavidin (SA) labelling strategies to define the configurations of two specific tubes, along with the absolute conformations of their component tiles. Such structural details of the DNA tubes composed of tiles with addressable concave and convex faces and packing directions should help us understand their physio&#8208;chemical and biological properties, and therefore promote their applications in drug delivery, biocatalysis, biomedicine, etc.

         <title>PET Imaging of Self&#8208;Assembled 18F&#8208;Labelled Pd2L4 Metallacages for Anticancer Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of two new self&#8208;assembled 18F&#8208;labelled [Pd2L4]4+ cages featuring a hydrophobic cavity able to encapsulate the anticancer drug cisplatin is reported, enabling biodistribution studies by positron emission tomography (PET) in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
To advance the design of self&#8208;assembled metallosupramolecular architectures as new generation theranostic agents, the synthesis of 18F&#8208;labelled [Pd2L4]4+ metallacages is reported. Different spectroscopic and bio&#8208;analytical methods support the formation of the host&#8208;guest cage&#8208;cisplatin complex. The biodistribution profiles of one of the cages, alone or encapsulating cisplatin have been studied by PET/CT imaging in healthy mice in&#8197;vivo, in combination to ICP&#8208;MS ex vivo.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Phase Characterization of Hypervalent Carbon Compounds Bearing 7&#8208;6&#8208;7&#8208;Ring Skeleton: Penta&#8208; versus Tetra&#8208;Coordinate Isomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we afford explicit characterizations of electronic and geometrical structures of recently reported hypervalent penta&#8208;coordinate carbon compounds by using gas&#8208;phase characterization techniques: photodissociation spectroscopy (PDS) and ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS). In particular for a compound with moderately electron donating ligand bearing p&#8208;methylthiophenyl substituents, the coexistence of tetra&#8208; and penta&#8208;coordinate isomers are confirmed, consistent with the solution characterizations. It is in sharp contrast to the exclusive tetra&#8208;coordinate form (with normal valence of the central carbon atom) in the single crystal. This suggests that non&#8208;polar environment makes penta&#8208;coordinate structure thermodynamically most stable. This delicate difference between the tetra&#8208; and penta&#8208;coordinate structures dependent on environments is a close reflection of the lower activation barrier of SN2 reaction found under neutral solvent or gas&#8208;phase reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and crystal structure of a new RTH&#8208;type precursor and its interlayer expanded zeolite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two dimensional zeolites have drawn a lot of attention due to their structural diversity and chemical composition, which can be used to obtain 3D zeolites unable to be direct synthesized. Here, a new layer silicate zeolite L was synthesized using the N, N&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;(2&#8208;methyl)&#8208;benzimidazolium as the structure&#8208;directing agent (SDA) under fluoride condition. Structure determination from the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that the pure silica precursor with five&#8208;ring pores in the crystalline sheets is composed of the  rth  layer stacking along the (001) direction in an &#8230;AAAA&#8230; sequence with SDA  +  cations and F  &#8208;  residing within the interlayer spaces. Variable temperature powder X&#8208;ray diffraction results&#160;showed the new layer could transform into 3D RTH topology structure at 350 &#176;C via 2D&#8208;3D topotactic transformation. Furthermore, a new 3D zeolite material is obtained by treating the original layer with diethoxydimethylsilane agent under hydrochloric acid condition (HCl&#8208;DEDMS). Based on the powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and the original layer structure, the new 3D zeolite structure expanding the  rth  layer linking with another Si atom is constructed, which possesses a 10&#215;8&#215;6 channel system. It displays a high BET surface area of 188 cm  3  /g with an external surface area of 130 cm  3  /g. The structure and textural properties pave a way for the potential catalytic application. The research not only provides a new layer zeolite, broadening the 2D zeolite framework types, but also allows for the discovery of a new stable 3D zeolite expanding the RTH structure with Si atom, which hasn&#8217;t been reported yet.</dc:description>

The research not only provides a new layer zeolite, broadening the 2D zeolite framework types, but also allows for the discovery of a new stable 3D zeolite expanding the RTH structure with Si atom, which hasn&#8217;t been reported yet.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Sterically encumbered bis(m&#8208;terphenyl)chalcogenides, (2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3)E (E = S, Se, Te) were obtained by the reaction of the chalcogen tetrafluorides, EF4, with three equivalents of m&#8208;terphenyl lithium, 2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3Li. The single electron oxidation of (2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3)2Te using XeF2 / K[B(C6F5)4] afforded the radical cation [(2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3)2Te][B(C6F5)4] that was isolated and fully characterized.

         <title>Fluorescence Turn&#8208;on of Tetraphenylethylene Derivative by Transfer from Cyclodextrin to Liposomes, HeLa cells, and E. coli</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, trimethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CDx) and &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CDx) could dissolve a tetraphenylethylene derivative (TPE&#8208;OH4) in water through high&#8208;speed vibration milling. The fluorescence intensity of the TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CDx&#8211;TPE&#8208;OH4 complex was much higher than that of the &#947;&#8208;CDx&#8211;TPE&#8208;OH4 complex, as the rotation of the central C&#9552;C double bond of TPE&#8208;OH4 after photoactivation was inhibited in a smaller TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CDx cavity in comparison with the &#947;&#8208;CDx cavity. In contrast, the fluorescence intensity of the &#947;&#8208;CDx&#8211;TPE&#8208;OH4 complex was very weak; nevertheless, it increased after the addition of liposomes due to the transfer of TPE&#8208;OH4 from the &#947;&#8208;CDx cavity to the lipid membrane as a &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; phenomenon. Furthermore, to apply temperature sensor, we demonstrated that the fluorescence intensity in the liposomes depended on the phase transition temperature. By using the fluorescence turn&#8208;on phenomenon, TPE&#8208;OH4 could detect the presence of HeLa cells and E. coli by fluorescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative photochemical reaction kinetics in organic molecular crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoreactive molecular crystals have been intensively investigated as next&#8208;generation functional materials. Changes in physicochemical properties are usually interpreted in terms of static pre&#8208; and post&#8208;reaction molecular structures and packings determined by X&#8208;ray structure analysis. However, to elucidate the dynamic properties, it is necessary to understand the dynamic nature of photochemical kinetics in crystals. Reaction dynamics in the crystal phase can be dramatically different from those in dilute solution because the local molecular environment evolves as the surrounding reactant molecules are transformed into products.&#160; In this review, we summarize multiple examples of photochemical reactions in the crystalline phase that do not follow classical kinetic behavior.&#160; We also discuss different theoretical methods that can be used to describe this behavior. This review article should help provide a foundation for future workers to understand and analyze photochemical reaction kinetics in crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Organic Frameworks: Structures and Functional Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a new class of porous crystalline materials, hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) assembled from building blocks via hydrogen bonds have gained increasing attention. HOFs benefit from advantages including mild synthesis, easy purification, and good recyclability. However, some HOFs transform into unstable frameworks after desolvation, which hinders&#160;their further applications. Nowadays, the main challenges of developing HOFs lie in stability improvement, porosity establishment, and functionalization. Recently, more and more stable and permanently porous HOFs have been reported. Among all these design strategies, stronger charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds and coordination bonds have been proven to be effective for developing stable, porous, and functional solids&#160;called hybrid HOFs, including ionic and metallized HOFs. This review discusses the rational design synthesis principles of hybrid HOFs and their cutting&#8208;edge&#160;applications in selective inclusion, proton conduction, gas separation, catalysis and so forth.</dc:description>

         <title>The Insertion of EII and EIV Chlorides (E=Si, Ge) into the Si&#8722;Si Bond of Disilylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inserting tetrylenes into the Si&#8722;Si bond of a base&#8208;stabilized disilylene produced new examples of bis(silylene), asymmetric disilylene and germylene&#8208;silylene compounds. Additionally, the reactivity of the starting disilylene towards SiIV chlorides was investigated.







Abstract
Reactions of silicon and germanium dichlorides L&#8901;ECl2 (E=Si, L=IPr; E=Ge, L=dioxane) with the phosphinoamidinato&#8208;supported disilylene ({&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}Si)2 resulted in formal tetrylene insertions into the Si&#8722;Si bond. In the case of the reaction with silylene, two products were isolated. The first product ({&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}Si)2SiCl2, is the formal product of direct SiCl2 insertion into the Si&#8722;Si bond of ({&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}Si)2 and thus features two separated silylamido silylene centers. Over time, migration of the SiCl2 group to a lateral position afforded the second product, the disilylene {&#954;2(Si,P)&#8722;SiCl2NNP}Si&#8722;Si{&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}. In contrast, insertion of GeCl2 resulted only in the isolation of the germanium analogue of {&#954;2(Si,P)&#8722;SiCl2NNP}Si&#8722;Si{&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}, containing a Ge atom in the central position namely, compound {&#954;2(Si,P)&#8722;SiCl2NNP}Ge&#8722;Si{&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}, which is a rare example of a silylene&#8208;germylene. Finally, reaction of disilylene ({&#954;2(N,P)&#8722;NNP}Si)2 with SiCl4 and SiHCl3 led to the formation of the new bis(silyl)silylene, ({NNP}SiCl2)2Si:. All four new products from these insertion reactions have been characterized by multinuclear NMR and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies.

         <title>Reactivity of E4 (E4=P4, As4, AsP3) towards Low&#8208;Valent Al(I) and Ga(I) Compounds</title>

Bond by bond. The conversion of yellow arsenic with the group 13 metal compound [LGa] (L=[{N(C6H3iPr2&#8208;2,6)C(Me)}2CH]&#8722;) leads to one As&#8722;As bond cleavage in [LGa(&#951;1:1&#8208;As4)]. By reacting this product with an unsaturated metal complex, two further As&#8722;As bonds are broken, to form a butadiene&#8208;like As4 chain stabilized in the coordination sphere of transition metals as well as main group metals.







Abstract
The reactivity of yellow arsenic and the interpnictogen compound AsP3 towards low&#8208;valent group 13 compounds was investigated. The reactions of [LAl] (1, L=[{N(C6H3iPr2&#8208;2,6)C(Me)}2CH]&#8722;) with As4 and AsP3 lead to [(LAl)2(&#956;,&#951;1:1:1:1&#8208;E4)] (E4=As4 (3&#8201;b), AsP3 (3&#8201;c)) by insertion of two fragments [LAl] into two of the six E&#8722;E edges of the E4 tetrahedra. Furthermore, the reaction of [LGa] (2) with E4 afforded [LGa(&#951;1:1&#8208;E4)] (E4=As4 (4&#8201;b), AsP3 (4&#8201;c)). In these compounds, only one E&#8722;E bond of the E4 tetrahedra was cleaved. These compounds represent the first examples of the conversion of yellow arsenic and AsP3, respectively, with group 13 compounds. Furthermore, the reactivity of the gallium complexes towards unsaturated transition metal units or polypnictogen (En) ligand complexes was investigated. This leads to the heterobimetallic compounds [(LGa)(&#956;,&#951;2:1:1&#8208;P4)(LNi)] (5&#8201;a), [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)(&#956;,&#951;4:1:1&#8208;E4)(LGa)] (E=P (6&#8201;a), As (6&#8201;b), Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;=&#951;5&#8208;C5H2tBu3) and [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Ni)(&#951;3:1:1&#8208;E3)(LGa)] (E=P (7&#8201;a), As (7&#8201;b)), which combine two different ligand systems in one complex (nacnac and Cp) as well as two different types of metals (main group and transition metals). The products were characterized by crystallographic and spectroscopic methods.

         <title>Interactive Bioconjugation at N&#8208;Terminal Cysteines by Using O&#8208;Salicylaldehyde Esters towards Dual Site&#8208;Selective Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Terminal cysteine is a hot&#8208;spot for bioconjugation that enables the construction of complex bioconjugates. In this study, we show that O&#8208;salicylaldehyde esters are a fast and selective reagent for modifying N&#8208;terminal cysteine, which can be easily removed under acidic conditions, and used in dual site&#8208;selective bioconjugations. More information can be found in the Research Article by M.&#8197;J.&#8197;S.&#8197;A. Silva, P.&#8197;M.&#8197;P. Gois, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202377).

         <title>Selective Separation of Hazardous Chemicals from Vapor phase by an Easily Accessible Breathing Coordination Polymer Derived from Terpyridyl/terephthalate Mixed Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordination polymers are extensively studied materials because of their various potential applications. Amongst them, breathing coordination polymers that are capable of exchanging lattice occluded guest molecules with other guests via single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8208;SC) fashion are particularly intriguing. Herein, we disclose an easily accessible breathing coordination polymer namely DMF@Zn&#8208;CP capable of exchanging as many as 23 guest molecules of various kinds in SC&#8208;SC fashion when the crystals of the coordination polymer were exposed to the corresponding vapor of the guests. Selectivity experiments revealed that it was also capable of separating selectively hazardous chemicals such as dichloro&#8208;methane, benzene and fluorobenzene from the corresponding complex mixture of vapors of halomethanes, aromatic hydrocarbons and halobenzenes. The breathing coordination polymer could also be exploited as drug delivery vehicle; slow and sustained release of anti&#8208;bacterial agents (benzyl alcohol/phenethyl amine) as guests against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria was evident in zone inhibition assays. A mixed ligand strategy wherein a nitrile containing terpyridyl ligand (L) and terephthalate (TA) co&#8208;ligand were reacted with Co(II)/Ni(II)/Zn(II) nitrate salts was adopted herein. Three coordination polymers namely MeOH@Co&#8208;CP, DMF/H2O@Ni&#8208;CP and DMF@Zn&#8208;CP were isolated and characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Studies revealed that only DMF@Zn&#8208;CP possessed the ability to breath in response to the vapors of the guests as stimuli.</dc:description>

         <title>Light Modulated Reversible &#8220;On&#8208;Off&#8221; Transformation of Arylazoheteroarene Based Discotics in Nematic Organization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable mesogens: A series of reversibly photoswitchable C3&#8208;symmetric discotic liquid crystals have been made using a threefold phenylazo&#8208;3,5&#8208;dimethylisoxazole tethered benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) core. In a discotic nematic organization, they exhibit high thermal stability of metastable states, excellent reversibility in photoswitching, and robust light&#8208;controlled mesomorphological changes.







Abstract
Three benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) core&#8208;based molecular systems appended with phenylazo&#8208;3,5&#8208;dimethylisoxazole photoswitches at the peripheral position through variable&#8208;length alkoxy chains have been designed and synthesized. The supramolecular interactions of the mesogens provided discotic nematic liquid crystalline assembly as confirmed by polarized optical microscopy (POM) and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) studies. Spectroscopic studies confirmed the reversible photoswitching and excellent thermal stability of the photoswitched states in solution phase and thin film. Also, atomic force microscopic (AFM) and POM investigations demonstrated the morphological changes in the self&#8208;assembly induced by the photoirradiation as monitored by the changes in the height profiles and optical appearance of the textures, respectively. Remarkably, the liquid crystalline discotic molecules showed reversible &#8220;on and off states&#8221; controlled by light at ambient temperature.

In a discotic nematic organization, they exhibit high thermal stability of metastable states, excellent reversibility in photoswitching, and robust light-controlled mesomorphological changes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide (BTA) core-based molecular systems appended with phenylazo-3,5-dimethylisoxazole photoswitches at the peripheral position through variable-length alkoxy chains have been designed and synthesized. The supramolecular interactions of the mesogens provided discotic nematic liquid crystalline assembly as confirmed by polarized optical microscopy (POM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies. Spectroscopic studies confirmed the reversible photoswitching and excellent thermal stability of the photoswitched states in solution phase and thin film. Also, atomic force microscopic (AFM) and POM investigations demonstrated the morphological changes in the self-assembly induced by the photoirradiation as monitored by the changes in the height profiles and optical appearance of the textures, respectively. Remarkably, the liquid crystalline discotic molecules showed reversible &#8220;on and off states&#8221; controlled by light at ambient temperature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metallic Catalysts for Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane Using CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallic catalysts in the CO2&#8722;ODP reaction are summarized in detail in view of various aspects such as the type of materials, catalyst design concepts, reaction mechanisms, and the role of CO2.







Abstract
The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 (CO2&#8722;ODP) is a promising technique for realizing high&#8208;yield propylene production and CO2 usage. Developing a highly efficient catalyst for CO2&#8722;ODP is essential and beneficial to the chemical industry and for realizing net&#8208;zero emissions. Many studies have investigated metal oxide&#8208;based catalysts, revealing that rapid deactivation and low selectivity remain limiting factors for their industrial applications. In recent years, metallic nanoparticle catalysts have become increasingly attractive due to their unique properties. Therefore, we summarize the performance of metal&#8208;based catalysts in CO2&#8722;ODP reactions by considering catalyst design concepts, different mechanisms in the reaction process, and the role of CO2.

         <title>A Potent Auto&#8208;Umpolung Ligand for Conjugative Radical Stabilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bis(dicyanomethid)cyclopropenium&#8208;based &#8220;auto&#8208;umpolung&#8221; carbene ligand stabilizes a neutral nitrogen radical. The latter is characterized via EPR measurements in solution and X&#8208;ray structural analyses in the solid state. Both indicate that the radical is in equilibrium with aggregates and a &#963;&#8208;bound dimer.







Abstract
Carbenes with conjugatively connected redox system act as &#8220;auto&#8208;umpolung&#8221; ligands. Due to their electronic flexibility, they should also be particularly suitable to stabilize open&#8208;shell species. Herein, the first neutral radical of such sort is described in form of a dialkylamino&#8208;substituted bis(dicyanomethylene)cyclopropanide. Despite the absence of steric shielding, the radical is stable for an extended amount of time and was consequently characterized in solution via EPR measurements. These data and accompanying X&#8208;ray structural analyses indicate that the radical species is in equilibrium with aggregates (formed via &#960;&#8208;stacking) and dimers (obtained via &#963;&#8208;bond formation between methylene carbons).

         <dc:description>
The advances in oxidative N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalysis are reviewed according to the strategies that rely on typical NHC&#8208;bound intermediates, including acyl/imidoyl azolium, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl azolium, and azolium peroxide species, as well as NHC&#8208;derived ortho&#8208;quinone methide (o&#8208;QM), aza&#8208;fulvene, and triaza&#8208;diene intermediates, with particular focus on mechanistic aspects.







Abstract
Oxidative N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis offers the chance to perform oxidative and oxygenative transformations which give rise to various NHC&#8208;bound intermediates, paving the way to non&#8208;umpolung processes through activation of carbon atoms and heteroatoms. The aim of this review is to discuss the developments of the literature in the field of oxidative NHC&#8208;catalysis since 2014, with particular focus to pivotal intermediates and their mechanistic involvement.

         <title>On the Mechanism of the Formal [2+2] Cycloaddition &#8211; Retro&#8208;electrocyclization (CA&#8208;RE) Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;click&#8208;like&#8221; [2+2] cycloaddition &#8208; retro&#8208;electrocyclization (CA&#8208;RE) reaction was followed under a variety of conditions using NMR spectroscopy. Several mechanistic models were evaluated by considering multiple experiments simultaneously. Surprisingly, only a model in which the final 1,1,4,4&#8208;tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene product promoted the first step described well all the data. The CA&#8208;RE reaction is hence an autocatalytic reaction.







Abstract
The [2+2] cycloaddition &#8208; retro&#8208;electrocyclization (CA&#8208;RE) reaction is a &#8220;click&#8208;like&#8221; protocol for facile synthesis of donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores from an alkyne and tetracyanoethylene. Herein we shed light on the mechanism of this reaction by detailed kinetics studies using 1H NMR spectroscopy. By considering several experiments simultaneously, a variety of mechanistic models was evaluated. Surprisingly, a model in which the final 1,1,4,4&#8208;tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene product promoted the first step was the only one that described well the experimental data. This autocatalysis model also involved a non&#8208;concerted, stepwise formation of the cyclobutene cycloaddition adduct. By proper choice of conditions, we were able to generate the transient cyclobutene in sufficient amount to verify it as an intermediate using 13C NMR spectroscopy. For its final retro&#8208;electrocyclization step, simple first&#8208;order kinetics was observed and only minor solvent dependence, which indicates a concerted reaction.

         <title>Carbonyl&#8208;Containing Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters for Narrow&#8208;Band Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress of ketone&#8208;based TADF emitters with narrow&#8208;band properties is summarized. The molecular design involved in maintaining excellent device efficiency and extraordinary color purity is highlighted.







Abstract
Carbonyl&#8208;containing derivatives show enduring vitality in the field of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials; they can realize high device efficiency by using both singlet and triplet excitons for electroluminescence. Recently, a system based on fused ketone/amine exhibited huge potential for constructing multi&#8208;resonance TADF (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters, which exhibit higher narrow&#8208;band emission than conventional TADF emitters with twisted donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) structure. Herein, we summarize current research progress in both traditional and MR&#8208;type ketone derivatives with TADF characteristics for introducing the molecular design strategy of maintaining high device efficiency while keeping narrow&#8208;band emission profile. We hope this review can inspire the emergence of more high&#8208;performance narrow&#8208;band materials.

         <title>Characterization of the glmS Ribozymes from Listeria Monocytogenes and Clostridium Difficile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The glmS ribozyme of L. monocytogenes stringently discriminates between co&#8208;factors and retains cleavage activity at low temperatures, illustrating unique characteristics of individual glmS ribozymes.







Abstract
The glmS ribozyme regulates the expression of the essential GlmS enzyme being involved in cell wall biosynthesis. While &gt;450 variants of the glmS ribozyme were identified by in silico approaches and homology searches, only a few have yet been experimentally investigated. Herein, we validate and characterize the glmS ribozymes of the human pathogens Clostridium difficile and Listeria monocytogenes. Both ribozymes, as their previous characterized homologs rely on glucosamine&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate as co&#8208;factor and the presence of divalent cations for exerting the cleavage reaction. The observed EC50 values in turn were found to be in the submicromolar range, at least an order of magnitude lower than observed for glmS ribozymes from other bacteria. The glmS ribozyme of L. monocytogenes was further shown to bear unique properties. It discriminates between co&#8208;factors very stringently and other than the glmS ribozyme of C. difficile retains activity at low temperatures. This finding illustrates that albeit being highly conserved, glmS ribozymes have unique characteristics.

         <title>Divergent Copper&#8208;salt&#8208;controlled Reactions of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes and N&#8208;Fluorobenzene Sulfonimide: Access to the 1,3&#8208;Haloamines and Aminoindanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for divergent copper&#8208;salt&#8208;controlled ring&#8208;opening 1,3&#8208;bifunctionalization reactions of D&#8208;A cyclopropanes was developed; 1,3&#8208;aminohalogenation and 1,3&#8208;aminoarylation products were generated in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
We herein report a method for divergent copper salt controlled reactions of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes and N&#8208;fluorobenzene sulfonimide (NFSI). Specifically, in the presence of CuX2 (X=Cl, Br), the cyclopropanes underwent formal umpolung 1,3&#8208;aminohalogenation bifunctionalization via a free radical mediated ring&#8208;opening process to afford 1,3&#8208;aminochlorination and 1,3&#8208;aminobromination products in moderate to good yields. In addition, by using CuI as a catalyst, we synthesized various aminoindane derivatives via 1,3&#8208;aminoarylation cyclization of D&#8208;A cyclopropanes, the reactions involved a free radical mediated ring&#8208;opening and subsequent ring expansion via C&#8722;H bond activation.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Borylation of Propargylic Acetates for the Synthesis of Multisubstituted Allenylboronates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multisubstituted allenylboronates were easily accessed through iron&#8208;catalyzed borylation of propargylic acetates. The reaction is highly efficient, occurs under mild conditions, and is easy to scale up. The reaction is stereospecific and occurs with anti&#8208;SN2&#8216; displacement of the acetate by boron, which allows a transfer of chirality. Several transformations including propargylation and further additions highlight the synthetic utility of this reaction.







Abstract
A novel iron&#8208;catalyzed borylation of propargylic acetates leading to allenylboronates has been developed. The method allows the preparation of a variety of di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted allenylboronates at room temperature with good functional group compatibility. Stereochemical studies show that an anti&#8208;SN2&#8217; displacement of acetate by boron occurs; this also allows transfer of chirality to yield enantiomerically enriched allenylboronates. The synthetic utility of this protocol was further substantiated by transformations of the obtained allenylboronates including oxidation and propargylation.

         <title>Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Metal Silver&#8208;Mediated Base Pairs: Metal&#8208;Centred Chirality versus DNA Helical Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For a small number of consecutive metal&#8208;mediated base pairs in a DNA duplex, the chirality&#8208;at&#8208;metal of a chiral metal&#8208;mediated base pair is determined by the intrinsic helical chirality of the duplex. With an increasing number of adjacent metal&#8208;mediated base pairs, the chirality&#8208;at&#8208;metal can topple so that the intrinsically preferred isomer is adopted.







Abstract
When covalently incorporating ligands capable of forming chiral metal complexes into a DNA oligonucleotide duplex, an enantiospecific formation of metal&#8208;mediated base pairs is possible. We have been investigating the chirality of the silver&#8208;mediated base pair P&#8722;AgI&#8722;P (P, 1H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;f][1,10]phenanthroline) depending on the number of consecutive P&#8201;:&#8201;P pairs within a series of duplexes. Towards this end, both enantiomers of the nucleoside analogue 3&#8208;(1H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;f][1,10]phenanthrolin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)propane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diol comprising an acyclic backbone were introduced into DNA duplexes, resulting in diastereomeric metal&#8208;mediated base pairs. The same chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal complex is formed inside the duplex for up to five neighbouring P&#8722;AgI&#8722;P pairs, irrespective of whether (S)&#8208;P or (R)&#8208;P is used. With six silver&#8208;mediated base pairs, the chirality of the metal complex is inverted for (S)&#8208;P but not for (R)&#8208;P. This indicates an intricate balance of what determines the configuration of the metal complex, the intrinsically preferred metal&#8208;centred chirality or the DNA helical chirality.

         <title>Aromatic 1,2&#8208;Azaborinin&#8208;1&#8208;yls as Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Anionic Nitrogen Ligands for Main Group Elements</title>

         <dc:description>The 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3,4,5,6&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborinines 1&#8208;EMe3 and 2&#8208;EMe3 (E = Si, Sn; aryl = Ph (1), Mes (= 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl, 2)) were synthesized by ring&#8208;expansion of borole precursors with N3EMe3&#8208;derived nitrenes. Desilylative hydrolysis of 1&#8208; and 2&#8208;SiMe3 yielded the corresponding N&#8208;protonated azaborinines, which were deprotonated with nBuLi or MN(SiMe3)2 (M = Na, K) to the corresponding group 1 salts, 1&#8208;M and 2&#8208;M. While the lithium salts crystallized as monomeric Lewis base adducts, the potassium salts formed coordination polymers or oligomers via intramolecular K&#183;&#183;&#183;aryl &#960; interactions. The reaction of 1&#8208;M or 2&#8208;M with CO2 yielded N&#8208;carboxylate salts, which were derivatized by salt metathesis to methyl and silyl esters. Salt metathesis of 1&#8208;M or 2&#8208;M with methyl triflate, [Cp*BeCl] (Cp* = C5Me5), BBr2Ar (Ar = Ph, Mes, 2&#8208;thienyl), ECl3 (E = B, Al, Ga) and PX3 (X = Cl, Br) afforded the respective group 2, 3 and 5 1,2&#8208;azaborinin&#8208;2&#8208;yl complexes. Salt metathesis of 1&#8208;K with BBr3 resulted not only in N&#8208;borylation but also Ph&#8208;Br exchange between the endocyclic and exocyclic boron atoms. Solution 11B NMR data suggest that the1,2&#8208;azaborinin&#8208;2&#8208;yl ligand is similarly electron&#8208;withdrawing to a bromide. In the solid state the endocyclic bond length alternation and the twisting of the C4BN ring increase with the sterics of the substituents at the boron and nitrogen atoms, respectively. Regression analyses revealed that the downfield shift of the endocyclic 11B NMR resonances is linearly correlated to both the degree of twisting of the C4BN ring and the tilt angle of the N&#8208;substituent. Calculations indicate that the 1,2&#8208;azaborinin&#8208;1&#8208;yl ligand has no sizeable &#960;&#8208;donor ability and that the aromaticity of the ring can be subtly tuned by the electronics of the N&#8208;substituent.</dc:description>

         <title>Concertedness and Activation Energy Control by Distal Methyl Group during Ring Contraction/Expansion in Scalarane&#8208;type Sesterterpenoid Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Salmahyritisol A, similan A, and hippospongide A, which are scalarane&#8208;type sesterterpenoids, feature 6/6/5/7/5 pentacyclic skeletons. Although their biosyntheses have been previously proposed to involve a unique skeletal rearrangement reaction, the detailed reaction mechanism remains unclear as none of the corresponding biosynthetic enzymes for this reaction have been reported. Herein, we investigated this skeletal rearrangement reaction using computational techniques, which revealed the following four key features: (i) the distal 24&#8208;Me substituent controls both the concertedness and activation energy of this transformation, (ii) enzymes are not responsible for the observed regioselectivity of C12&#8211;C20 bond formation, (iii) stereoselectivity is enzyme&#8208;regulated, and (iv) protonation is a key step in this skeletal rearrangement process. These new findings provide insight into the C&#8208;ring&#8208;contraction and D&#8208;ring&#8208;expansion mechanisms in scalarane&#8208;type sesterterpenoid biosyntheses.</dc:description>

         <title>Resolving the Chemical Formula of Nesquehonite via&#160;NMR Crystallography, DFT Computation, and Complementary Neutron Diffraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nesquehonite is a magnesium carbonate mineral relevant to carbon sequestration envisioned for carbon capture and storage of CO2. Its chemical formula remains controversial today, assigned as either a hydrated magnesium carbonate [MgCO3&#8226;3H2O], or a hydroxy &#8208; hydrated &#8208; magnesium bicarbonate [Mg(HCO3)OH&#8226;2H2O]. The resolution of this controversy is central to understanding this material's thermodynamic, phase, and chemical behavior. We present an NMR crystallography study, using rotational&#8208;echo double&#8208;resonance 13C{1H} (REDOR) to determine 13C &#8208; 1H distances with precision, and the combination of 13C static NMR lineshapes and density &#8208; functional theory (DFT) calculations to model different H atomic coordinates. We find [MgCO3&#8226;3H2O] to be accurate, and evidence from neutron powder diffraction bolstered these assignments.&#160;Refined H positions can help us understand how H&#8208;bonding stabilizes this structure against dehydration to MgCO3. More broadly, our results illustrate the power of NMR crystallography as a technique for resolving questions where X&#8208;ray diffraction is inconclusive.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Interactions Between Brilliant Green and MscL Investigated by Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy and Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state NMR and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to study the dynamic pathway of triarylmethane dye Brilliant Green (BG) through the antimicrobial target MscL protein. Key residues (especially F23 and I27) and the specific processes that act on BG through the Ma&#8208;MscL channel are identified, and proof is presented that BG activates the hydrophobic gate of Ma&#8208;MscL by its bound water molecules.







Abstract
The mechanosensitive ion channel of large conductance (MscL) is a promising template for the development of new antibiotics due to its high conservation and uniqueness to microbes. Brilliant green (BG), a triarylmethane dye, has been identified as a new antibiotic targeted MscL. However, the detailed binding sites to MscL and the dynamic pathway of BG through the MscL channel remain unknown. Here, the dynamic interactions between BG and MscL were investigated using solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and molecule dynamics (MD) simulations. Residue site&#8208;specific binding sites of BG to the MscL channel were identified by solid&#8208;state NMR. In addition, MD simulations revealed that BG conducts through the MscL channel via residues along the inner surface of the pore sequentially, in which the strong hydrophobic interactions between BG and hydrophobic residues F23 and I27 in the hydrophobic gate region of the MscL channel are major restrictions. Particularly, it was demonstrated that BG activates the MscL channel by reducing the hydrophobicity of the F23 in the gate region by water molecules that are bound to BG. Taken together, these simulations and experimental data provide novel insights into the dynamic interactions between BG and MscL, based on which new hydrophobic antibiotics and adjuvants targeting MscL can be developed.

         <title>Direct Aroylation of Olefins through a Cobalt/Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative and Dehydrogenative Coupling with &#945;&#8208;Oxo Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible light promotes decarboxylative Heck&#8208;like benzoylations of olefins. This process leverages the synergistic interaction of a photoredox catalyst with cobaloxime catalysts to form enones through decarboxylation and hydrogen evolution. Mechanistic studies reveal different rate&#8208;limiting steps, depending on electronics of the olefin.







Abstract
A photoredox/cobalt dual catalytic procedure has been developed that allows benzoylation of olefins. Here the photoredox catalyst effects the decarboxylation of &#945;&#8208;ketoacids to form benzoyl radicals. After addition of this radical to styrenes, the cobalt catalyst abstracts a H&#8208;atom. Hydrogen evolution from the putative cobalt hydride intermediate allows a Heck&#8208;like aroylation without the need for a stoichiometric oxidant. Mechanistic studies reveal that electronically different styrenes lead to a curved Hammett plot, thus suggesting a change in product&#8208;determining step in the catalytic mechanism.

         <title>Modeling Type&#8208;1 Iodothyronine Deiodinase with Peptide&#8208;Based Aliphatic Diselenides: Potential Role of Highly Conserved His and Cys Residues as a General Acid Catalyst</title>

Type&#8208;1&#8201;iodothyronine deiodinase, which promotes the deiodination of iodine atoms on the outer and inner rings of thyroxine, was successfully modeled using a peptide&#8208;based selenocompound. Kinetic analyses of this reaction suggested that highly conserved His and Cys residues at the active site crucially act as general acid catalysts together with the selenocysteine redox center. Modeling Type&#8208;1 Iodothyronine Deiodinase with Peptide&#8208;Based Aliphatic Diselenides: Potential Role of Highly Conserved His and Cys Residues as a General Acid Catalyst (K. Arai et&#8197;al.)







Abstract
Type&#8208;1 iodothyronine deiodinase (ID&#8208;1) catalyzes the reductive elimination of 5&#8217;&#8208;I and 5&#8208;I on the phenolic and tyrosyl rings of thyroxine (T4), respectively. Chemically verifying whether I atoms with different chemical properties undergo deiodination through a common mechanism is challenging. Herein, we report the modeling of ID&#8208;1 using aliphatic diselenide (Se&#8208;Se) and selenenylsulfide (Se&#8208;S) compounds. Mechanistic investigations of deiodination using the ID&#8208;1&#8208;like reagents suggested that the 5&#8217;&#8208;I and 5&#8208;I deiodinations proceed via the same mechanism through an unstable intermediate containing a Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I halogen bond between a selenolate anion, reductively produced from Se&#8208;Se (or Se&#8208;S) in the compound, and an I atom in T4. Moreover, imidazolium and thiol groups, which may act as general acid catalysts, promoted the heterolytic cleavage of the C&#8208;I bond in the Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I intermediate, which is the rate&#8208;determining step, by donating a proton to the C atom.

         <title>Heavy Chains: Synthesis, Reactivity and Decomposition of Interpnictogen Chains with Terminal Diaryl Bismuth Fragments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Making and breaking chains. Interpnictogen chains have been synthesized, and their decomposition has been studied. It was shown that the compound Ph2BiP(tBu)BiPh2 reacts with the small N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (Me2IMe) as a &#8220;masked phosphinidene&#8221; to form Me2IMe=PtBu.







Abstract
In this work, we report the preparation of multiple interpnictogen chain compounds with three consecutive pnictogen atoms and terminal Ar2Bi fragments (Ar=Ph, Mes). Symmetrical compounds of the form Ar2Bi&#8722;E(tBu)&#8722;Bi2Ar (1: Ar=Ph, E=P; 2: Ar=Ph, Mes, E=As) as well as ternary interpnictogen compounds of the form Ar2Bi&#8722;E1(tBu)&#8722;E2tBu2 (Ar=Ph, Mes; 4: E1=P, E2=As; 5: E1=P, E2=Sb; 6: E1=As, E2=P) were prepared. The decomposition in solution at room temperature and under the influence of light was studied for compounds 1&#8211;6. The reactivity of 1Ph and 2Ph with the small N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene 1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (Me2IMe) was also studied. In the case of 1Ph, the formation and consecutive decomposition of Me2IMe=PtBu (8) was observed in solution. Hence, it was shown that 1Ph can react as a &#8220;masked phosphinidene&#8221;. In the case of 2Ph, no reaction with Me2IMe was observed. All isolated compounds were analysed by NMR and IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Gated, Selective Anion Exchange in Functionalized Self&#8208;Assembled Cage Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Appending functional groups to the exterior of Zn4L4 self&#8208;assembled cages allows gated control of anion binding. While the unfunctionalized cages contain aryl groups in the ligand that can freely rotate, attaching inert functional groups creates a &#8220;doorstop&#8221;, preventing rotation and slowing the guest exchange rate, even though the interiors of the host cavities are identically structured. The effects on anion exchange are subtle and depend on multiple factors, including anion size, the nature of the leaving anion, and the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability and steric bulk of the pendant groups. Multiple exchange mechanisms occur, and the nature of the external groups controls associative and dissociative exchange processes: these bulky groups affect both anion egress and ingress, introducing an extra layer of selectivity to the exchange. Small changes can have large effects: affinities for anions as similar as PF6&#8208; and SbF6&#8208; can vary by as much as 400&#8208;fold between identically sized cavities.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiapyricins (TPC&#8208;A/B, 1 and 2), which are novel metallophore scaffolds exhibiting selective divalent cation binding property, were produced in response to metal&#8208;deprived conditions by Saccharothrix sp. TRM_47004 isolated from the Lop Nor Salt Lake. TPCs represent a thiazolyl&#8208;pyridine skeleton of a calcium&#8208;binding natural product, calciphore, owing to the selectivity to calcium ions among diverse metal ions. The thiapyricins exhibited notable co&#8208;crystalline characteristics of the apo&#8208; and holo&#8208;forms with racemic enantiomers comprising a pair of space isomers in a &#916;/&#923;&#8208;form. Therefore, we postulated a mechanism for the four&#8208;hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of achiral natural products into chiral complexes. Furthermore, their metal&#8208;chelating trait aided the adaptation of the host during metal starvation by increasing the production of TPCs. This study presents a structural paradigm of a new calciphore, provides insight into the mechanism of natural product assembly, and highlights the causality between the production of the metallophore and metallic habitats.</dc:description>

         <title>Lead&#8208;Free Metal Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals: From Fundamentals to Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead&#8208;free metal halide Perovskite nanocrystals have emerged with promising properties to circumvent the important issues that still need to be addressed, such as stability and Pb toxicity, to enable practical and safe applications of perovskites.







Abstract
Lead (Pb) halide perovskite nanocrystals, with the general formula APbX3, where A=CH3NH3+, CH(NH2)2+, or Cs+ and X=Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, or I&#8722;, have emerged as a class of materials with promising properties due to their remarkable optical properties and solar cell performance. However, important issues still need to be addressed to enable practical applications of these materials, such as instability, mass production, and Pb toxicity. Recent studies have carried out the replacement of Pb by various less&#8208;toxic cations as Sn, Ge, Sb, and Bi. This variety of chemical compositions provide Pb&#8208;free perovskite and metal halide nanostructures with a wide spectral range, in addition to being considered less toxic, therefore having greater practical applicability. Highlighting the necessity to address and solve the toxicity problems related to Pb&#8208;containing perovskite, this review considers the prospects of the Pb&#8208;free perovskite, involving synthesis methods, and properties of them, including advantages, disadvantages, and applications.

         <title>Oxidative Cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 Linkage in Lignin via Co Nanoparticles Embedded in 3DNG as Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkage in lignin is one of the key steps for oxidative conversion of lignin to low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight aromatics. Herein, we prepare Co nanoparticles embedded in three&#8208;dimensional network of nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X) through immersion&#8208;pyrolysis procedure, in which X denotes the pyrolysis temperature. The detailed characterization of Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X shows that the Co nanoparticles are coated with a few layers of nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (NG) sheets that are further embedded in 3DNG matrix. The catalytic activities of the Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X for the oxidative cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkage in lignin model compounds with O2 as oxidant are explored. It is demonstrated that catalytic activities of as&#8208;prepared Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X can be tuned by varying the pyrolysis condition, and the Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;900 shows the highest catalytic activity, which is attributed to the enriched Co&#8208;Nx species, the strong surface basicity, and the mesoporous motif of 3DNG network. More pronouncedly, the Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;900 can also effectively catalyze the oxidative cleavage of organosolv lignin, generating certain monomeric aromatics. Additionally, the intrinsic magnetic property of Co nanoparticles makes the Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X be easily recovered from the reaction mixture, and the as&#8208;coated thin NG layer can protect Co nanoparticle from oxidation condition, which putting together afford the Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X with good reusability and stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Energy level, crystal morphology and fluorescence emission tuning in cocrystals via molecular&#8208;level engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic donor&#8208;acceptor complexes as new organic semiconductor class have attracted wide attention, due to their potential applications in functional optoelectronics. Herein, we present two new charge transfer cocrystals of di&#8208;cyanodiazafluorene (DCAF)&#8208;perylene (DCPE) and di&#8208;cyanodiazaflfluorene (DCAF)&#8208;pyrene (DCPY) through the rational cocrystal&#8208;engineering design. Although they are both 1:1 mixed stacking cocrystals with similar chemical structure, DCPE cocrystal possesses a non&#8208;centrosymmetric space group and narrower band gap compared to DPCY cocrystal, because of the non&#8208;covalent bonding variation. The electrostatic potential accumulated in the lateral facets leads to highly twisted nanobelts, and the strong H&#8208;aggregation causes fluorescence quenching. Meanwhile, the DCPY crystals with centrosymmetric space group and weaker intermolecular interactions show untwisted morphology and red emission. This study will be helpful for the design and understanding of functional cocrystal materials that can be used in flexible micro/nano&#8208;mechanics, mechanical energy, and optical devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Assembly of Helical Nanostructures: Solvent&#8208;Induced Morphology Transition and the Effect on Cell Adhesion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise manipulating both the morphology and chiroptical signals of supramolecular assemblies will help to better understand the natural biological self&#8208;assembly mechanism. Herein, two simple L/D&#8208;phenylalanine based derivatives (L/DPFM) are designed and their solvent&#8208;dependent morphology evolutions are illustrated. It is found that by increasing the content of H2O in the ethanol aqueous solutions, LPFM can self&#8208;assemble into right&#8208;handed nanofibers, flat fibrous structures and inversed left&#8208;handed nanofibers, respectively. The assemblies in ethanol and H2O exhibit opposite conformations and circular dichroism (CD) signals even though they are constructed from the same molecules. Thus, the morphology&#8208;dependent cell adhesion and proliferation behaviors are further characterized. Left&#8208;handed nanofibers are found to be more favorable for the cell adhesion compared with right&#8208;handed nanostructures. The quantitative AFM analysis showed that L929 cell adhesion force on left&#8208;handed LPFM fibers is much higher than that on structures with inversed handedness. Besides, the value of cell Young&#8217;s modulus is lower for left&#8208;handed nanofibrous films, which indicates better flexibility. The difference in cell&#8208;substrate interactions may lead to different effect on cell behaviors.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Coupling of Methane and Carbon Dioxide on Tantalum Cluster Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding molecular&#8208;scale reaction mechanisms is crucial for the design of modern catalysts with industrial prospect. Through joint experimental and computational studies, we investigate the direct coupling reaction of CH4 and CO2, two abundant greenhouse gases, mediated by Ta1,4+ ions to form larger oxygenated hydrocarbons. Coherent with proposed elementary steps, we expose products of CH4 dehydrogenation [Ta1,4CH2]+ to CO2 in a ring electrode ion trap. Product analysis and reaction kinetics indicate a predisposition of the tetramers for C&#8211;O coupling with a conversion to products of CH2O, whereas atomic cations enable C&#8211;C coupling yielding CH2CO. Many of the experimental findings are supported by thermodynamic computations, connecting structure, electronic properties, and catalyst function. Moreover, the study of bare Ta1,4+ compounds indicates that methane dehydrogenation is a significant initial step in the direct coupling reaction, enabling new, yet unknown reaction pathways.</dc:description>

Compared to macroscopic electrode measurements, electrochemical methods established on the single&#8208;particle scale have advantages in establishing the structure&#8208;property relationship. In recent years, great achievements have been made in the electrochemical energy storage and electrocatalysis for understanding the evolution and kinetics of electrodes by employing single&#8208;particle measurements. This concept aims to provide an overview of the update of single&#8208;particle measurements in the related electrochemical processes.

         <title>Hydrogenation Reactions with Synergistic Catalysis of Pd single atoms and nanoparticles under Near&#8208;Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the limited resources and high cost of noble metals, how to boost their catalytic activities is highly desired in the current catalysis industry. Here, we report a synergetic catalyst, combining Pd2+ and Pd0 species in a nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbons (NPC), which shows boosted catalytic activities in hydrogenation reactions of organic nitro compounds (nitrobenzene, 4&#8208;nitrophenol, 1&#8208;nitronaphthalene and 1&#8208;nitropropane) under near ambient conditions. This synergetic catalyst NPC&#8208;[Pd] was synthesized by partial reduction of a palladium&#8208;loaded NPC. The catalytic activities and selectivity of NPC&#8208;[Pd] for hydrogenation were enhanced significantly compared with those of NPC&#8208;Pd2+ or NPC&#8208;Pd0 nanoparticles. Theoretical calculations show that H2 preferentially dissociates on Pd nanoparticles, and then organic molecules (nitrobenzene) can be captured and react with the dissociated H atom on Pd2+ sites. Similar reaction procedure also occur on Pt or Rh. Hydrogenation of different aromatic compounds with different functional groups (naphthalene, 4&#8208;nitrochlorobenzene, benzaldehyde and acetophenone) confirmed the broad excellent catalytic activity of this synergistic catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Homogeneous Dearomative Hydrogenation with a Co/P4N2 catalyst: a nucleophilic approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arene hydrogenation provides the most straightforward method to prepare carbo&#8208; and heterocycles, but the high resonance energy prevents an aromatic substrate from hydrogenation. We herein reported the homogeneous hydrogenation of less electron&#8208;rich arenes and heteroarenes in a nucleophilic manner. The Co(P4N2)H species that has been demonstrated to be a strong hydride donor could deliver a hydride ion to the cyano (hetero)arene substrates. Deuterium labeling experiments supported a Michael&#8208;type reaction pathway. Theoretical analyses have been conducted to investigate the hydricity of the catalytically active CoH species and the electrophilicity of the arene substrates. An outlook for more challenging substituted benzene was proposed based on the in&#8208;silico modification of the CoH species.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing the CRISPR&#8208;Cas13d System for Protein Detection via Dual&#8208;aptamer&#8208;based Transcription Amplification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CRISPR&#8208;based biosensing technology has been emerging as a revolutionary diagnostics for many diseases&#8208;related biomarkers. In particular, RspCas13d, a newly identified RNA&#8208;guided Cas13d ribonuclease derived from Ruminococcus sp., has shown great promise for accurate and sensitive detection of RNA due to its RNA sequence&#8208;specific recognition and robust collateral trans&#8208;cleavage activity. However, its diagnostic utility is limited to detect nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;related biomarkers. To address this limitation, we herein present a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of a target&#8208;responsive CRISPR&#8208;Cas13d sensing system for protein biomarkers. Such a system is rationally designed by integrating a Dual&#8208;Aptamer&#8208;based Transcription Amplification Strategy with CRISPR&#8208;Cas13d (DATAS&#8208;Cas13d), in which the protein binding initiates the  in vitro  RNA transcription followed by the activation of RspCas13d. Using a short fluorescent ssRNA as the signal reporter and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) as the model analyte, the DATAS&#8208;Cas13d system showed a wide linear range, low detection limit and high specificity for the detection of cTnI in buffer and human serum. Thanks to the facile integration of various bioreceptors into the DATAS&#8208;Cas13d system, the method could be adapted to detecting a broad range of clinically relevant protein biomarkers, and thus broaden the medical applications of Cas13d&#8208;based diagnostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Nontoxic Artificial Chloride Channel Formation in Epithelial Cells by Isophthalic Acid&#8208;Based Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial channels capable of facilitating the transport of Cl&#8210;  ions across cell membranes while being nontoxic to the cells are rare. Such synthetic ion channels can mimic the functions of membrane transport proteins and, therefore, have the potential to treat channelopathies by replacing defective ion channels. Here we report isophthalic acid&#8208;based structurally simple molecules  1a  and  2a, which self&#8208;assemble to render supramolecular nanochannels that allow selective transport of Cl&#8210;  ions. As evident from the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, the self&#8208;assembly is governed by intermolecular hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960;&#160;stacking interactions. The MD simulation studies for both  1a  and  2a  confirmed the formation of stable Cl&#8210;  channel assembly in the lipid membrane and Cl&#8210;  transport through them. The MQAE assay showed the efficacy of the compounds in delivering Cl&#8210;  ions into cells, and the MTT assays proved that the compounds are nontoxic to cells even at a concentration of 100 &#181;M.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Weaving technology has been extensively used for the manufacturing of macroscopical fabrics and satisfaction of artistic demands of humans through the ages. Integrating woven geometries into molecular structures is always a persistent pursuit, and yet a significant challenge of chemists, owing to the lack of effective methodologies to guide the regular mutual interlacing of molecular strands. In this Concept article, recent progress and related strategies in constructing woven polymer networks (WPNs) are summarized and discussed. An outlook was then given to highlight the future opportunities and challenges in the development of both molecularly woven structures and molecularly woven functional materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>G&#8208;quadruplexes are emerging targets in cancer research and understanding how diagnostic probes bind to DNA G&#8209;quadruplexes in solution is critical to the development of new molecular tools. In this study the binding of an enantiopure NIR emitting [Os(TAP)2(dppz)]2+ complex to different G&#8208;quadruplex structures formed by human telomer (hTel) and cMYC sequences in solution is reported. The combination of NMR and time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopic techniques reveals the sensitivity of the emission response to subtle changes in the binding environment of the complex.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two representative organic photoreactions, namely a bi&#173;molecular photocycloaddition and a monomolecular photo&#173;rearrange&#173;ment, are presented that are accelerated when the reaction is performed "on&#8208;water", that is, at the water&#8208;substrate interface with no solvation of the reaction components. According to the established models of ground&#8208;state reactions "on&#8208;water", the enhanced efficiency of the photoreactions is explained by hydrophobic effects (Patern&#243;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction) or specific hydrogen bonding (di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;methane rearrangement) at the water&#8208;substrate interface that decrease the energy of the respective transition state. These results point to the potential of this approach to conduct photo&#173;reactions more efficiently in an ecologically favorable medium.</dc:description>

         <title>Disproportionation and ligand lability in low oxidation state boryltin chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boryltin compounds featuring the metal in the +1 or 0 oxidation states can be synthesized from the carbene&#8208;stabilized tin(II) bromide (boryl)Sn(NHC)Br (boryl = {B(NDippCH)2}; NHC = C{(NiPrCMe)2}) by the use of strong reducing agents. The formation of the mono&#8208;carbene stabilized distannyne and donor&#8208;free distannide systems (boryl)SnSn(IPrMe)(boryl) (2) and K2[Sn2(boryl)2], (3) using Mg(I) and K reducing agents mirrors related germanium chemistry. In contrast to their lighter congeners, however, systems of the type [Sn(boryl)]n  are unstable with respect to disproportionation. Carbene abstraction from 2 using BPh3, and two&#8208;electron oxidation of 3 both result in the formation of a 2:1 mixture of the Sn(II) compound Sn(boryl)2, and the hexatin cluster, Sn6(boryl)4 (4). A viable mechanism for this rearrangement is shown by quantum chemical studies to involve a vinylidene intermediate (analogous to the isolable germanium compound, (boryl)2Ge=Ge), which undergoes facile atom transfer to generate Sn(boryl)2 and trinuclear [Sn3(boryl)2]. The latter then dimerizes to give the observed hexametallic product 4, with independent studies showing that similar trigermanium species aggregate in analogous fashion.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Si on the oxidation behaviors of Ti3Al1&#8722;xSixC2 at 1000 &#176;C</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, Ti3Al1&#8722;xSixC2 (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6) with Al/Si solid solution structure are synthesized, the effects of Si on their oxidation behaviors at 1000 &#186;C are evaluated. The addition of Si not only contributes to the formation of Ti5Si3 impurity but also affects the composition of the oxide scale. Particularly, incorporation of Si in the TiO2 lattice is demonstrated, which alters the formation energy of the (110) plane in TiO2, thus leading to the preferential growth of Si&#8208;doped TiO2 to dendritic congeries. Moreover, the Si addition is believed to affect mass transportation during the oxidation process, which accelerates the formation of a continuous Al2O3 layer in the oxide scale. With an optimized Si content, the oxidation of Ti3Al1&#8722;xSixC2 is restrained. However, with excess Si content, the continuity of the resulting Al2O3 layer is destroyed, thus the oxidation rate rises again.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Dehydrogenative Borylation via Dihydrogen Bond Bridged Electron Donor and Acceptor Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Air&#8208;stable amine&#8208; and phosphine&#8208;boranes are discovered as donors to integrate with pyridinium acceptor for generating photoactive electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes. Experimental results and DFT calculations suggest a dihydrogen bond bridging the donor and acceptor. Illuminating the EDA complex enables an intramolecular single electron transfer to give boron&#8208;centered radical for dehydrogenative borylation with no need of external photosensitizer and radical initiator. The deprotonation of Wheland&#8208;like radical intermediate rather than its generation is believed to determine the good ortho &#8208;selectivity based on DFT calculations. A variety of &#945;&#8208;borylated pyridine derivatives have been readily synthesized with good functional group tolerance.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To realize the direct and full use of the widely distributed solar energy, developing novel materials with superb photothermal conversion capability is essential. Although heteropoly blue has intrinsic outstanding solar absorption and photothermal conversion properties, its spectral absorption in the infrared region is weak. Here, composites of heteropoly blue and carbon nanotubes (HPB/CNTs) are synthesized depending on electrostatic interactions by facile microwave sonication and freeze&#8208;drying. The doped CNTs can dramatically improve the spectral absorption performance of HPB ontology in the infrared region. As a result, the light absorption of the optimized HPB/CNTs (20%) reaches more than 95 % in the range of 200&#8208;2400 nm, showing promising prospects as high&#8208;performance photothermal conversion material in the applications of solar desalination and wastewater treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Next Generation Copper Mediators for the Efficient Production of 18F&#8208;Labeled Aromatics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Evaluation of a series of Cu(II) complexes revealed several highly efficient mediators for radiofluorination of aryl boronic and stannyl substrates. After optimization of the reaction conditions, their application enabled preparation of seven PET&#8208;tracers in improved radiochemical yields and/or using significantly lower precursor loadings.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;mediated radiofluorination is a versatile tool for the preparation of 18F&#8208;labeled (hetero)aromatics. In this work, we systematically evaluated a series of complexes and identified several generally applicable mediators for highly efficient radiofluorination of aryl boronic and stannyl substrates. Utilization of these mediators in nBuOH/DMI or DMI significantly improved 18F&#8208;labeling yields despite use of lower precursor amounts. Impressively, application of 2.5&#8197;&#956;mol aryl boronic acids was sufficient to achieve 18F&#8208;labeling yields of up to 75&#8201;%. The practicality of the novel mediators was demonstrated by efficient production of five PET&#8208;tracers and transfer of the method to an automated radiosynthesis module. In addition, (S)&#8208;3&#8208;[18F]FPhe and 6&#8208;[18F]FDOPA were prepared in activity yields of 23&#177;1&#8201;% and 30&#177;3&#8201;% using only 2.5&#8197;&#956;mol of the corresponding boronic acid or trimethylstannyl precursor.

         <title>A Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter Investigated by Time&#8208;Resolved Near&#8208;Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free TADF (thermally activated delayed fluorescence) emitter was investigated by time&#8208;resolved near&#8208;infrared spectroscopy. This enabled upper excited states that contribute to spin&#8208;vibronic coupling to be detected.







Abstract
Emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) require small singlet (S1)&#8208;triplet (T1) energy gaps as well as fast intersystem crossing (ISC) transitions. These transitions can be mediated by vibronic mixing with higher excited states Sn and Tn (n=2, 3, 4, &#8230;).

     alt="A Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter Investigated by Time-Resolved Near-Infrared Spectroscopy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A metal-free TADF&lt;/b&gt; (thermally activated delayed fluorescence) emitter was investigated by time-resolved near-infrared spectroscopy. This enabled upper excited states that contribute to spin-vibronic coupling to be detected.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emitters for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) require small singlet (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)-triplet (T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) energy gaps as well as fast intersystem crossing (ISC) transitions. These transitions can be mediated by vibronic mixing with higher excited states S&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;

         <title>Activated Single&#8208;Phase Ti4O7 Nanosheets with Efficient Use of Precious Metal for Inspired Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;purity, single&#8208;crystal Ti4O7 nanosheets with a high specific surface area have been synthesized for the first time. Synergy and a strong metal&#8208;support interaction interface between Pt clusters and Ti4O7 were constructed with the assistance of visible light irradiation (650&#8197;nm). Continuous active sites (Ti3+, Pt2+, and Pt0+) for the ORR multielectron process are supplied. The new VI&#8722;Pt/Ti4O7 NSs exhibit excellent ORR activity.







Abstract
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is central to modern energy storage and conversion technologies for grids such as fuel cells and electrolyzers, but challenges remain due to the lack of reliable, economic, and durable electrocatalysts. Here, we develop single&#8208;crystal conductive black titanium (Ti4O7) nanosheets (NSs) as a new precious metal carrier based on sacrificial hard templates and ultrasonic&#8208;assisted peeling, and deposit Pt clusters on Ti4O7&#8201; NSs induced by wetness impregnation under the irradiation of visible light (VI; 650&#8197;nm). Pt/Ti4O7&#8201; NSs provide Ti3+, Pt2+, and Pt0+ continuous active sites for the ORR multielectron process, achieving synergy among them. The assistance of visible light not only makes a more uniform and smaller distribution of Pt nanoclusters, but also strengthens the charge transfer, thereby constructing a strong metal&#8208;support interaction interface. VI&#8722;Pt/Ti4O7&#8201; NSs show superior initial oxidation potential and a mass activity of 1.61&#8197;A&#8201;mg&#8722;1Pt at a E1/2=0.91&#8197;V, which is nine times higher than that of commercial Pt/C. This work provides an effective strategy for achieving high&#8208;value applications of titanium sub&#8208;oxides and further explores the enhanced interface in metals TinO2n&#8208;1 by light radiation.

         <title>The Influence of Small Biomolecules, Salts and Buffers on the Molecular Recognition of Amide Naphthotube in Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binding affinities of amide naphthotube to neutral organic molecules in water are not influenced by a majority of small biomolecules, inorganic salts, and PBS and Tris buffers.







Abstract
We found the binding affinities of amide naphthotube to neutral organic molecules in water are not influenced by most of small biomolecules, inorganic salts, and PBS and Tris buffers but are reduced in HEPES buffer through competitive binding. Nevertheless, salts do change the binding affinities of amide naphthotube to charged molecules through a screening effect.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Arylation Polymerization for the Synthesis of Thiophene&#8208;Based Cross&#8208;linked Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An earth&#8208;abundant nickel(II) bipyridine catalyst allows the direct arylation polymerization of non&#8208;activated (poly)thiophenes with (poly)aryl halides leading to a series of 20 highly reticulated, porous and alternating conjugated polymers with yields from 50 to 99&#8201;%.







Abstract
An earth&#8208;abundant nickel(II) bipyridine catalyst, combined with lithium hexamethyldisilazide as base, demonstrates its wide applicability in the direct arylation polymerization of di&#8208; and tri&#8208;thiophene heteroaryls with poly(hetero)aryl halides. With a nickel catalyst loading of 2.5&#8197;mol%, a series of twenty highly cross&#8208;linked organic polymers is obtained in 34 to 99&#8201;% yields. Using mixed polytopic coupling partners allows obtaining alternating and optically active thiophene&#8208;based solids with intrinsic porosity.

         <title>Organocatalyzed Phospha&#8208;Michael Addition: A Highly Efficient Synthesis of Customized Bis(acyl)phosphane Oxide Photoinitiators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phospha&#8208;Michael addition of bis(mesitoyl)phosphine to a variety of activated C&#8722;C bonds was investigated. Simple amine bases were employed as catalysts, with tetramethylguanidine showing an outstanding performance and allowing the preparation of bis(acyl)phosphines under very mild conditions in excellent yields and short time. Oxidation of the bis(acyl)phosphines led to bis(acyl)phosphane oxides, a substance class belonging to the most potent photoinitiators.







Abstract
Addition of the P&#8722;H bond in bis(mesitoyl)phosphine, HP(COMes)2 (BAPH), to a wide variety of activated carbon&#8211;carbon double bonds as acceptors was investigated. While this phospha&#8208;Michael addition does not proceed in the absence of an additive or catalyst, excellent results were obtained with stoichiometric basic potassium or caesium salts. Simple amine bases can be employed in catalytic amounts, and tetramethylguanidine (TMG) in particular is an outstanding catalyst that allows the preparation of bis(acyl)phosphines, R&#8722;P(COMes)2, under very mild conditions in excellent yields after only a short time. All phosphines RP(COMes)2 can subsequently be oxidized to the corresponding bis(acyl)phosphane oxides, RPO(COMes)2, a substance class belonging to the most potent photoinitiators for radical polymerizations known to date. Thus, a simple and highly atom economic method has been found that allows the preparation of a broad range of photoinitiators adapted to their specific field of application even on a large scale.

         <title>Enhancing the Resistive Switching Behavior of WORM Memory Devices using D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A Based Ester&#8208;Flanked Quinolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Donor&#8208;Acceptor systems are highly appreciated in the field of organic memory devices due to their efficient charge transport within the systems. In this work, we have designed and synthesized a D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A system constituting ester&#8208;flanked quinolines and functionalized triarylamines (TAA) through a single&#8208;step cross&#8208;coupling reaction to fabricate memory devices via Write&#8208;Once Read&#8208;Many times (WORM) non&#8208;volatile memory. Structure&#8208;property relationships are reconnoitered for these conjugated D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A systems through a series of UV, fluorescence, XRD, DFT, and memory characterizations. The UV and CV data show efficient charge transfer with intramolecular charge transfer occurring at 407&#8208; 417 nm and a short band gap of 2.56&#8208; 2.65 eV. An enhancement in the resistive switching behavior of the memory devices is observed for the compounds with simple TAA&#8208;quinoline and tert&#8208;butylphenyl substituted TAA and fluorophenyl substituted quinoline due to balanced charge distribution in the compounds.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Donor-Acceptor systems are highly appreciated in the field of organic memory devices due to their efficient charge transport within the systems. In this work, we have designed and synthesized a D-&#960;-A system constituting ester-flanked quinolines and functionalized triarylamines (TAA) through a single-step cross-coupling reaction to fabricate memory devices via Write-Once Read-Many times (WORM) non-volatile memory. Structure-property relationships are reconnoitered for these conjugated D-&#960;-A systems through a series of UV, fluorescence, XRD, DFT, and memory characterizations. The UV and CV data show efficient charge transfer with intramolecular charge transfer occurring at 407- 417 nm and a short band gap of 2.56- 2.65 eV. An enhancement in the resistive switching behavior of the memory devices is observed for the compounds with simple TAA-quinoline and tert-butylphenyl substituted TAA and fluorophenyl substituted quinoline due to balanced charge distribution in the compounds. This enhanced switching induces an on/off ratio of 103 by generating a highly ordered arrangement in the thin films. The HOMO, LUMO levels, and the ESP images together estimate a charge transfer and charge trapping as the plausible mechanism for the solution-processable WORM memory devices. The longer retention time (103 s) and lower threshold voltages (-1.21 - -2.12 V) of the devices makes them intriguing compounds for memory applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interplay between hydrogen bonding and electron transfer in mixed valence assemblies of triarylamine trisamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions are assumed to play a critical role in the long&#8208;range transport of light or charge recently observed in supramolecular assemblies of C3&#8208;symmetrical discotic molecules. Herein, the structure of mixed valence assemblies formed by irradiating triarylamine trisamide (TATA) molecules was determined by multifarious techniques under various conditions with the aim of probing the interplay between the hydrogen bonding network and the rate of electron transport in different states (solution, gel, film). Irradiation was performed under initial states that vary by the degree of association of TATA monomers through hydrogen bonds. Firstly, a significant shift of the N&#9472;H and C=O stretching frequencies was observed by FT&#8208;IR upon irradiation thus revealing an overlooked signature of TATA&#8226;+ species and interacting mixed valence aggregates. Secondly, gels and films both mostly consist of hydrogen&#8208;bonded TATA polymers but their EPR spectra recorded at 293 K reveal very different behaviors: localized electrons in the gels versus fully delocalized electrons in the films. Hydrogen bonding thus appears as a necessary but not sufficient condition to get fast electron transfer rates and a packing of the TATA monomers particularly suitable for charge transport is assumed to exist in the solid state. Finally, defects in the hydrogen bonding network are detected upon increasing the number of radical species in the mixed valence assemblies present in the film state without impeding the delocalization of the unpaired electrons. A delicate balance between hydrogen bonds and packing is thus necessary to get supramolecular polarons in mixed valence TATA assemblies.</dc:description>

         <title>Caging of a Strongly Pairing Fluorescent Thymidine Analog with Soft Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling the pairing strength of nucleobases in DNA through reactions with compounds found inside the cell is a formidable challenge. Here we report how a thiazolyl substituent turns a strongly pairing ethynylpyridone C&#8208;nucleoside into a reactive residue in oligonucleotides. The thiazolyl&#8208;bearing pyridone reacts with soft nucleophiles, such as glutathione, but not with hard nucleophiles like hydroxide or carbonate. The addition products pair much more weakly with adenine in a complementary strand than the starting material, and also change their fluorescence. This makes oligonucleotides containing the new deoxynucleoside interesting for controlled release. Due to its reactivity toward N, P, S, and Se&#8208;nucleophiles, and the visual signal accompanying chemical conversion, the fluorescent nucleotide reported here may also have applications in chemical biology, sensing and diagnostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Organometallic Pt(II) Photosensitisers that Demonstrate Ligand&#8208;Modulated Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation Energy Upconversion Efficiencies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of 2&#8208;phenylquinoxaline ligands have been synthesised that introduce either CF3 or OCF3 electron withdrawing groups at different positions of the phenyl ring. These ligands were investigated as cyclometalating reagents for Pt(II) to give neutral complexes of the form [Pt(C^N)(acac)] (where C^N = cyclometalating ligand; acac = acetyl acetonate). X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies on three examples showed that the complexes adopt an approximate square planar geometry. All examples revealed strong Pt&#8722;Pt linear contacts of 3.2041(6), 3.2199(3) and 3.2586(2) &#197;. The highly coloured complexes display efficient visible absorption at 400&#8208;500 nm (&#949; ~ 5000 M&#8208;1 cm&#8208;1) and orange&#8208;red photoluminescent characteristics (&#955;em = 603&#8208;620 nm; &#934;em &#8804; 37%) which were subtly tuned by the ligand. Triplet emitting character was confirmed via microsecond luminescence lifetimes and the photogeneration of singlet oxygen with quantum efficiencies up to 57%. Each complex was investigated as a photosensitiser for triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation energy upconversion using 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene as the annihilator species: a range of good upconversion efficiencies (&#934;UC 5.9&#8208;14.1%) were observed and shown to be strongly influenced by the ligand structure in each case.</dc:description>

Compound 1 was obtained as an equilibrium mixture of a cyclic trimer and a cyclic tetramer in solution, the latter of which was crystallized in benzene by vapor diffusion of hexane at 7 &#176;C. The dynamic nature of this system was confirmed by solvent&#8208; and concentration&#8208;dependent experiments. Notably, the dynamics was verified using flow NMR spectroscopy, which revealed that the time required to reach equilibrium was influenced by the solvent ratio (&lt;18 s, 24&#8211;28 s, and 34&#8211;42 s in 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2 mixtures of acetone&#8208;d6 and C6D6, respectively). Compound 1 and 3&#8208;[4&#8242;&#8208;(diethylboryl)phenyl]pyridine (2) exhibited different self&#8208;assembly behavior in solution and crystals. Density functional theory calculations suggested that this difference was largely due to enhanced planarity between two consecutive aromatic rings.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Carbon&#8211;Heteroatom Coupling
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exogenous photocatalyst&#8208;free, single nickel&#8208;catalyzed carbon&#8211;heteroatom coupling under visible&#8208;light irradiation is reported. Over 15&#8197;classes of nucleophile can efficiently couple with aryl/alkene halides to afford valuable heteroatomic arenes/alkenes. The unprecedentedly broad substrate scope and late&#8208;stage modification of valuable molecules fully demonstrate the benefits of the method.







Abstract
Herein, we report visible light&#8208;promoted single nickel catalysis for diverse carbon&#8211;heteroatom couplings under mild conditions. This mild, general, and robust method to couple diverse nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur nucleophiles with aryl(heteroaryl)/alkenyl iodides/bromides exhibits a wide functional group tolerance and is applicable to late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals and natural products. On the base of preliminary mechanistic studies, a NiI/NiIII cycle via the generation of active NiI complexes that appear from homolysis of NiII&#8722;I rather than NiII&#8722;aryl bond was tentatively proposed.

         <dc:description>
High energy density and long lifespan sodium metal batteries. In this review, recent progress in high energy density and long lifespan SMBs is summarized from the aspects of modification of the sodium metal anode, electrolyte exploration, and cathode design. In addition, some insights toward their practical applications are introduced.







Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) have been widely studied owing to their relatively high energy density and abundant resources. However, they still need systematic improvement to fulfill the harsh operating conditions for their commercialization. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in SMBs in terms of sodium anode modification, electrolyte exploration, and cathode design. Firstly, we give an overview of the current challenges facing Na metal anodes and the corresponding solutions. Then, the traditional liquid electrolytes and the prospective solid electrolytes for SMBs are summarized. In addition, insertion&#8208; and conversion&#8208;type cathode materials are introduced. Finally, an outlook for the future of practical SMBs is provided.

The unusual solid&#8208;state transformation of Na4SnS4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;14H2O into Na4Sn2S6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;5H2O at ambient conditions is elucidated on the molecular level by combined in&#8197;situ and ex situ experiments supported by theoretical calculations.







Abstract
A highly unusual solid&#8208;state epitaxy&#8208;induced phase transformation of Na4SnS4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;14H2O (I) into Na4Sn2S6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;5H2O (II) occurs at room temperature. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations indicate an internal acid&#8208;base reaction to form [SnS3SH]3&#8722; which condensates to [Sn2S6]4&#8722;. The reaction involves a complex sequence of O&#8722;H bond cleavage, S2&#8722; protonation, Sn&#8722;S bond formation and diffusion of various species while preserving the crystal morphology. In&#8197;situ Raman and IR spectroscopy evidence the formation of [Sn2S6]4&#8722;. DFT calculations allowed assignment of all bands appearing during the transformation. X&#8208;ray diffraction and in&#8197;situ 1H&#8197;NMR demonstrate a transformation within several days and yield a reaction turnover of &#8776;0.38&#8201;%/h. AIMD and experimental ionic conductivity data closely follow a Vogel&#8208;Fulcher&#8208;Tammann type T dependence with D(Na)=6&#215;10&#8722;14&#8197;m2&#8201;s&#8722;1 at T=300&#8197;K with values increasing by three orders of magnitude from &#8722;20 to +25&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Chiral Naphthalenediimides with High&#8208;Efficiency Fluorescence and Circularly Polarized Luminescence in the Solid State for the Application in Organic Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral non&#8208;core substituted naphthalenediimides (NDIs) exhibit an L&#8208;shape conformation and self&#8208;assemble into discrete dimers in the solid state. The unique discrete dimeric stacking significantly promoted the fluorescence quantum yields and chiroptical properties via the formation of pre&#8208;associated excimers. The findings disrupt the general idea that non&#8208;core substituted NDIs cannot exhibit strong fluorescence in the solid state.







Abstract
Naphthalenediimides (NDIs) have been extensively studied due to their tunable luminescent properties. However, generally, the monomers or aggregates of non&#8208;core substituted NDIs exhibit low fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;FL&lt;10&#8201;%) in the solid state, which limit their applications as light&#8208;emitting materials and render their chiral species unsuitable for circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Herein, a series of non&#8208;core substituted chiral NDIs that exhibit high luminous efficiencies (&#934;FL up to 56.8&#8201;% for racemate and 36.5&#8201;% for enantiomer) and a strong CPL behavior in the solid state is reported. These significant improvements are attributed to the unique molecular conformation of the chiral NDIs and the formation of distinctive discrete dimers. The structures of the NDIs were significantly simpler and more accessible than those of other NDIs. The findings evidence that non&#8208;core substituted NDIs can exhibit strong fluorescence in the solid state and provide a new pathway to improve photophysical properties of NDIs.

         <title>Isolation and Reactivity of Stannylenoids Stabilized by Amido/Imino Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel stannylenoid was isolated by using a bulky amido ligand. It can be converted to the dimeric chlorostannylene at 80&#8201;&#176;C with the elimination of LiCl. Treatment of the amidostannylenoid with IPrNLi (IPrN=bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;iminato) led to the formation of amido(imino)stannylene. In addition, the reaction of bis(imino)stannylenoid with N2O resulted in a dimeric Sn/O/Li complex.







Abstract
The reaction of the lithium aryl(silyl)amide Dipp(iPr3Si)NLi (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) with one equivalent of SnCl2 in THF gave a novel stannylenoid Dipp(iPr3Si)NSnCl&#8901;LiCl(THF)2. Heating the solution of amidostannylenoid in toluene to 80&#8201;&#176;C resulted in dimeric amido(chloro)stannylene [Dipp(iPr3Si)NSnCl]2, which can be converted to bis(amido)stannylene Sn[N(Dipp)(iPr3Si)]2 and amido(imino)stannylene Sn[N(Dipp)(iPr3Si)][IPrN] (IPrN=bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;imino). Treatment of bis(imino)stannylenoid [IPrN]2Sn(Cl)Li with N2O resulted in the dimeric complex [IPrNSn(Cl)OLi]2. All compounds were characterized by NMR, elementary analysis, and X&#8208;ray structural determination.

         <title>Intra&#8208; and Intermolecular Cooperativity in the Catalytic Activity of Phosphodiester Cleavage by Self&#8208;Assembled Systems Based on Guanidinylated Calix[4]arenes.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Calix[4]arene scaffold, blocked in the cone conformation through alkylation with long alkyl chains, and decorated at the upper rim with four guanidine or arginine units, effectively catalyzes the cleavage of the phosphodiester bond of DNA and RNA model compounds in water. An exhaustive kinetic investigation unequivocally points to the existence of spontaneous aggregation phenomena, driven by hydrophobic interactions, occurring at different critical concentrations that depend on the identity of the compound. A pronounced superiority of the assembled structures compared with the monomers in solution was observed. Moreover, the catalytically active units, clustered on the macrocyclic tetrafunctional scaffold, were proved to efficiently cooperate in the catalytic mechanism and result in improved reaction rates compared to those of the monofunctional model compounds. The kinetic analysis is also integrated and corroborated with further experiments based on fluorescence spectroscopy and light scattering.
The advantage of the supramolecular assemblies based on tetrafunctional calixarenes leads to believe that the active units can cooperate not only intramolecularly but also intermolecularly. The molecules in the aggregates can probably mold, flex and rearrange but, at the same time, keep an ordered structure that favor phosphodiester bond cleavage. This dynamic preorganization can allow the catalytic units to reach a better fitting with the substrates and perform a superior catalytic activity.</dc:description>

Moreover, the catalytically active units, clustered on the macrocyclic tetrafunctional scaffold, were proved to efficiently cooperate in the catalytic mechanism and result in improved reaction rates compared to those of the monofunctional model compounds. The kinetic analysis is also integrated and corroborated with further experiments based on fluorescence spectroscopy and light scattering.
The advantage of the supramolecular assemblies based on tetrafunctional calixarenes leads to believe that the active units can cooperate not only intramolecularly but also intermolecularly. The molecules in the aggregates can probably mold, flex and rearrange but, at the same time, keep an ordered structure that favor phosphodiester bond cleavage. This dynamic preorganization can allow the catalytic units to reach a better fitting with the substrates and perform a superior catalytic activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dichromic Allophycocyanin Trimer Covering a Broad Spectral Range (550&#8208;660 nm)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phycobilisomes, the light&#8208;harvesting complexes of cyanobacteria and red algae, are a resource for photosynthetic, photonic and fluorescence labeling elements. They cover an exceptionally broad spectral range, but the complex super structure and assembly has been an obstacle. By replacing in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 the biliverdin reductases, we studied the role of chromophores in the assembly of the phycobilisome core. Introduction of the green&#8208;absorbing phycoerythrobilin instead of the red&#8208;absorbing phycocyanobilin inhibited aggregation. A novel, trimeric allophycocyanin (Dic&#8208;APC) was obtained. In the small (110 kDa) unit, the two chromophores, phycoerythrobilin and phytochromobilin, cover a wide spectral range (550 to 660 nm). Due to efficient energy transfer, it provides an efficient artificial light&#8208;harvesting element. Dic&#8208;APC was generated in vitro using the contained core&#8208;linker, LC, for template&#8208;assisted purification and assembly. Labeling the linker provides a method for targeting Dic&#8208;APC.</dc:description>

         <title>How to Shrink the Ring: Phospholenes from Phosphabenzenes via Selective Ring Contraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A 3&#8208;aminofunctionalized phosphabenzene (phosphinine) was synthesized and structurally characterized. The pyramidalized nitrogen atom of the dimethylamino substituent indicates only a weak interaction between the lone pair of the nitrogen atom and the aromatic phosphorus heterocycle, resulting in somewhat basic character. It turned out that the amino group can indeed be protonated by HCl. In contrast to pyridines, however, the phosphabenzene&#8208;ammonium salt undergoes a selective ring contraction to form a hydroxylphospholene oxide in the presence of additional water. Based on deuterium labelling experiments and quantum chemical calculations, a rational mechanism for this hitherto unknown conversion is proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and Functional Insight into the Mechanism of the Fe&#8208;S Cluster&#8208;Dependent Dehydratase from Paralcaligenes ureilyticus.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme&#8208;catalyzed reaction cascades play an increasingly important role for the sustainable manufacture of diverse chemicals from renewable feedstocks. For instance, dehydratases from the ilvD/EDD superfamily have been embedded into a cascade to convert glucose via pyruvate to isobutanol, a platform chemical for the production of aviation fuels and other valuable materials. These dehydratases depend on the presence of both a Fe&#8208;S cluster and a divalent metal ion for their function. However, they also represent the rate&#8208;limiting step in the cascade. Here, catalytic parameters and the crystal structure of the dehydratase from Paralcaligenes ureilyticus (PuDHT, both in presence of Mg2+ and Mn2+) were investigated. Rate measurements demonstrate that the presence of stoichiometric concentrations Mn2+ promotes higher activity than Mg2+, but at high concentrations the former inhibits the activity of PuDHT. Molecular dynamics simulations identify the position of a second binding site for the divalent metal ion. Only binding of Mn2+ (not Mg2+) to this site affects the ligand environment of the catalytically essential divalent metal binding site, thus providing insight into an inhibitory mechanism of Mn2+ at higher concentrations. Furthermore, in silico docking identified residues that play a role in determining substrate binding and selectivity. The combined data inform engineering approaches to design an optimal dehydratase for the cascade.</dc:description>

         <title>Di&#8208;Iron(II) [2+2] Helicates of Bis&#8208;(Dipyrazolylpyridine) Ligands &#8211; the Influence of the Ligand Linker Group on Spin State Properties</title>

L  1  and  L  2  form [Fe  2  (  &#956;  &#8208;  L  )  2  ]X  4  (X  &#8210;  = BF  4  &#8210;  or ClO  4  &#8210;  ) helicate complexes when treated with the appropriate iron(II) precursor. Solvate crystals of [Fe  2  (  &#956;  &#8208;  L  1  )  2  ][BF  4  ]  4  exhibit three different helicate conformations, which differ in the torsions of their butanediyl linker groups. The solvates exhibit gradual thermal spin&#8208;crossover, with examples of stepwise switching and partial spin&#8208;crossover to a low temperature mixed&#8208;spin form. Salts of [Fe  2  (  &#956;  &#8208;  L  2  )  2  ]  4+  are high&#8208;spin, which reflects their highly twisted iron coordination geometry. The composition and dynamics of assembly structures formed by iron(II) with  L  1  &#8208;  L  3  vary with the ligand linker group, by mass spectrometry and  1  H NMR.

L  1  and  L  2  form [Fe  2  (  &#956;  -  L  )  2  ]X  4  (X  &#8210;  = BF  4  &#8210;  or ClO  4  &#8210;  ) helicate complexes when treated with the appropriate iron(II) precursor. Solvate crystals of [Fe  2  (  &#956;  -  L  1  )  2  ][BF  4  ]  4  exhibit three different helicate conformations, which differ in the torsions of their butanediyl linker groups. The solvates exhibit gradual thermal spin-crossover, with examples of stepwise switching and partial spin-crossover to a low temperature mixed-spin form. Salts of [Fe  2  (  &#956;  -  L  2  )  2  ]  4+  are high-spin, which reflects their highly twisted iron coordination geometry. The composition and dynamics of assembly structures formed by iron(II) with  L  1  -  L  3  vary with the ligand linker group, by mass spectrometry and  1  H NMR. Gas phase DFT calculations imply the butanediyl linker conformation in [Fe  2  (  &#956;  -  L  1  )  2  ]  4+  influences its spin state properties, but show anomalies attributed to intramolecular electrostatic repulsion between the iron atoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Simple Substitution on Thyroid Hormones Remarkably Alters the Regioselectivity of Deiodination by a Deiodinase Mimic</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regioselective deiodinations of L&#8208;thyroxine (T4) play key roles in the thyroid hormone homeostasis. These reactions are catalyzed by three isoforms of the selenoenzymes, iodothyronine deiodinases (Dio1, Dio2 and Dio3), which are highly homologous in nature. Dio1 mediates 5&#8242;&#8208; or 5&#8208;deiodinations of T4 to produce T3 and rT3, respectively. In contrast, Dio2 and Dio3 are selective to 5&#8242;&#8208; or 5&#8208;deiodination to produce T3 and rT3, respectively. Understanding of the regioselectivity of deiodination at the molecular level is important as abnormal levels of thyroid hormone have been implicated in various clinical conditions, such as hypoxia, myocardial infarction, neuronal ischemia and cancer. In this paper, we report that the electronic properties of the iodine atoms in thyroxine (T4) can be modulated through a simple substitution in the 4'&#8208;phenolic moiety. This leads to the change in the regioselectivity of&#160;deiodination by different small molecule mimics of Dio enzymes. By using this chemical approach, we also show that the substitution of a strong electron withdrawing group facilitates the removal all four iodine atoms in the T4 derivative. Theoretical investigations on the hydrogen bonded adducts of T4 with imidazole indicate that the charge on the iodine atoms depend on the nature of hydrogen bond between the &#8208;OH group of T4 and the imidazole moiety. While the imidazole can act as either hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) or hydrogen bond donor (HBD), the protonated imidazole acts exclusively as HBD in T4&#8208;imidazole complex. These studies support the earlier observations that the histidine residue at the active sites of the deiodinases play an important role not only in the substrate binding, but also in altering the regioselectivity of the deiodination reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Coupling Value&#8208;Added Anodic Reactions with Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction features a promising approach to realize carbon neutrality. However, its competitiveness is limited by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at anode, which consumes a large portion of energy. Coupling value&#8208;added anodic reactions with CO2 electroreduction has been emerging as a promising strategy in recent years to enhance the full&#8208;cell energy efficiency and produce valuable chemicals at both cathode and anode of the electrolyzer. In this review, we briefly summarize recent progresses on the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, and the economic feasibility of different CO2 electrolysis system is discussed. Then we provide a comprehensive summary of recent advances in the coupled electrolysis of CO2 and potential value&#8208;added anodic reactions, with special focus on the specific cell designs. Finally, current challenges and future opportunities for the coupled electrolysis systems are also proposed, which are targeted to facilitate progress in this field and push the CO2 electrolyzers to a more practical level.</dc:description>

Base pair stabilizers 1 and 2 were used to drive isothermal displacement reactions. Fluorescent pyrene sensors were developed to monitor the reaction progress by fluorescence change.







Abstract
Purine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine and 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;7&#8208;bromopurine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyribonucleosides (1 and 2) were implemented in isothermal DNA strand displacement reactions. Nucleoside 1 is a weak stabilizer of dA&#8208;dT base pairs, nucleoside 2 evokes strong stabilization. Strand displacement reactions used single&#8208;stranded invaders with single and multiple incorporations of stabilizers. Displacement is driven by negative enthalpy changes between target and displaced duplex. Toeholds are not required. Two new environmental sensitive fluorescent pyrene sensors were developed to monitor the progress of displacement reactions. Pyrene was connected to the nucleobase in the invader or to a dendritic linker in the output strand. Both new sensors were constructed by click chemistry; phosphoramidites and oligonucleotides were prepared. Sensors show monomer or excimer emission. Fluorescence intensity changes when the displacement reaction progresses. Our work demonstrates that strand displacement with base pair stabilizers is applicable to DNA, RNA and to related biopolymers with applications in chemical biology, nanotechnology and medicinal diagnostics.

         <title>Reactivity of Sodium Pentaphospholide Na[cyclo&#8208;P5] towards C&#8801;E (E=C, N, P) Triple Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[Cyclo&#8208;P5]&#8722; reacts with alkynes and the isolobal nitriles and phosphaalkynes to generate novel, aromatic, five&#8208;membered heterocycles. DFT calculations give insight into the mechanism of the reaction. The anionic ligands coordinate in an &#951;5&#8208;fashion towards FeII to give the corresponding (aza)phosphametallocenes, which could be characterized crystallographically.







Abstract
A diglyme solution of Na[cyclo&#8208;P5] (1) reacts with alkynes and isolobal nitriles and phosphaalkynes to afford the otherwise elusive (aza)phospholide anions 2&#8201;a&#8211;c, 4&#8201;a,b, and 6. The reaction of Na[cyclo&#8208;P5] with alkynes and nitriles was studied by means of DFT methods, which suggested a concerted mechanism for the formation of 2&#8201;a and 4&#8201;b. The anions 2&#8201;a&#8211;c, 4&#8201;a,b, and 6 coordinate in an &#951;5&#8208;fashion towards FeII to give the sandwich (aza)phosphametallocenes 3&#8201;a&#8211;c, 5&#8201;a,b and 7 in moderate to good yields. The new compounds were characterized by means of multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and cyclic voltammetry.

The reaction of Na[&lt;i&gt;cyclo&lt;/i&gt;-P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;] with alkynes and nitriles was studied by means of DFT methods, which suggested a concerted mechanism for the formation of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;. The anions &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;a,b&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; coordinate in an &lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Dehydropolymerization of Phosphine&#8211;Boranes at Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyphosphinoboranes [PhRP&#8208;BH2]n, including P&#8208;disubstituted derivatives, were accessed by deprotonation of a series of readily prepared phosphine&#8211;(triflimido)borane adducts. The choice of base impacts the polymer molar mass and linear/cyclic ratio and transient phosphinoborane monomers, RR'P&#8208;BH2 are proposed intermediates.







Abstract
Stoichiometric reaction of phosphine&#8211;borane adducts RR'PH&#8901;BH3 (R=Ph, R&#8217;=H, Ph, Et, and R=R&#8217;=tBu) with the strong acid HNTf2 (Tf=SO2CF3) leads to H2 elimination and the formation of the triflimido derivatives, RR'PH&#8901;BH2(NTf2). Subsequent deprotonation by using bases, such as diisopropylethylamine or the carbene IPr (IPr=N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene), led to the formation of P&#8208;mono&#8208; or &#8208;disubstituted polyphosphinoboranes [RR'P&#8208;BH2]n. Evidence for the intermediacy of transient phosphinoborane monomers, RR'PBH2, was provided by trapping reactions.

         <title>Co&#8208;based Catalysts for Selective H2O2 Electroproduction via 2&#8208;electron Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process is emerging as a promising alternative method to the conventional anthraquinone process. To realize high&#8208;efficiency H2O2 electrosynthesis, robust and low cost electrocatalysts have been intensively pursued, among which Co&#8208;based catalysts attract particular research interests due to the earth&#8208;abundance and high selectivity. Here, we provide a comprehensive review on the advancement of Co&#8208;based electrocatalyst for H2O2 electroproduction. The fundamental chemistry of 2&#8208;electron ORR is discussed firstly for guiding the rational design of electrocatalysts. Subsequently, the development of Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts involving nanoparticles, compounds and single atom catalysts is summarized with the focus on active site identification, structure regulation and mechanism understanding. Moreover, the current challenges and future directions of the Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts are briefly summarized in this review.</dc:description>

         <title>Dielectric Relaxation and Dielectric Switching Behaviors in (N,N&#8208;Diisopropylethylamine) Tetrachloroantimonate(III)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dielectric relaxation and dielectric switching behaviors of a novel antimony&#8208;based halide semiconductor are characterized by experiments and first&#8208;principles molecular dynamics simulations. It contains a 1D chain, undergoes an isostructural order&#8208;disorder phase transition and shows a step&#8208;like dielectric anomaly, which can function as a frequency&#8208;tuned dielectric switch with highly adjustable switch temperature.







Abstract
Dielectric switches have drawn renewed attention to the study of their many potential applications with the adjustable switch temperatures (Ts). Herein, a novel antimony&#8208;based halide semiconductor, (N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine) tetrachloroantimonate ((DIPEA)SbCl4, DIPEA+=N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine), with dielectric relaxation behavior and dielectric switches has been successfully synthesized. This compound, consisting of coordinated anion 
 chains and isolated DIPEA+ cations, undergoes an isostructural order&#8208;disorder phase transition and shows a step&#8208;like dielectric anomaly, which can function as a frequency&#8208;tuned dielectric switch with highly adjustable switch temperature (Ts). Variable&#8208;temperature single&#8208;crystal structure analyses and first&#8208;principles molecular dynamics simulations give information about the general mechanisms of molecular dynamics. This work enriches the dielectric switch family and proves that hybrid metal halides are promising candidates for switchable physical or chemical properties.

         <title>Pentacyclic and Hexacyclic Osmaarynes and Their Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex world of osmium: The first pentacyclic and hexacyclic osmaaryne have been successfully synthesized. The nucleophilic reaction of osmaarynes was used to obtain the corresponding osmium complexes, which exhibited near&#8208;infrared luminescence, aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and photothermal conversion.







Abstract
Although osmabenzyne, osmanaphthalyne, osmaphenanthryne, and osmaanthracyne have been previously reported, the synthesis of polycyclic osmaarynes is still a challenge. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of the first pentacyclic osmaarynes (pyreno[b]osmabenzynes 1&#8201;a and 2&#8201;a) and hexacyclic osmaaryne (peryleno[b]osmabenzyne 3&#8201;a). Nucleophilic reaction of osmaarynes was used to obtain the corresponding pyreno[b]osmium complexes (1 and 2) and peryleno[b] osmium complex (3), which exhibited near&#8208;infrared luminescence and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties. Complexes 2 and 3 are resistant to photodegradation, and complex 2 has better photothermal conversion properties than 3.

Nucleophilic reaction of osmaarynes was used to obtain the corresponding pyreno[&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]osmium complexes (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) and peryleno[&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;] osmium complex (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), which exhibited near-infrared luminescence and aggregation-induced emission (AIE) properties. Complexes &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; are resistant to photodegradation, and complex &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; has better photothermal conversion properties than &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Carbodicarbenes and Striking Redox Transitions of their Conjugate Acids: Influence of NHC versus CAAC as Donor Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structures and coordination behavior of carbodicarbenes bearing three possible combinations of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and cyclic(alkyl)(amino)(carbene) (CAAC) are compared. The strikingly different redox transitions of their conjugate acids are also reported.







Abstract
Herein, a new type of carbodicarbene (CDC) comprising two different classes of carbenes is reported; NHC and CAAC as donor substituents and compare the molecular structure and coordination to Au(I)Cl to those of NHC&#8208;only and CAAC&#8208;only analogues. The conjugate acids of these three CDCs exhibit notable redox properties. Their reactions with [NO][SbF6] were investigated. The reduction of the conjugate acid of CAAC&#8208;only based CDC with KC8 results in the formation of hydrogen abstracted/eliminated products, which proceed through a neutral radical intermediate, detected by EPR spectroscopy. In contrast, the reduction of conjugate acids of NHC&#8208;only and NHC/CAAC based CDCs led to intermolecular reductive (reversible) carbon&#8211;carbon sigma bond formation. The resulting relatively elongated carbon&#8211;carbon sigma bonds were found to be readily oxidized. They were, thus, demonstrated to be potent reducing agents, underlining their potential utility as organic electron donors and n&#8208;dopants in organic semiconductor molecules.

         <title>Conjugation Extension and Halochromic Behaviors of S&#8208;Fused Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Bearing Cyclopenta[b]thiopyran Moieties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three S&#8208;fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) bearing cyclopenta[b]thiopyran moieties have been designed and successfully synthesized. With the conjugation extension, the absorption onset of the longest PAH reaches 1110 nm. All the three S&#8208;fused PAHs exhibit significant halochromic properties in both solution and solid states. Upon protonation, the proton is incorporated on the cyclopentadiene ring while the positive charge is localized on the thiopyrylium ring. Moreover, no significant difference can be found for the two shorter PAHs upon the protonation by different organic acids, such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH), while the longest PAH can be only mono&#8208;protonated by TFA but di&#8208;protonated by stronger TfOH. Furthermore, after protonation, the non&#8208;emissive S&#8208;fused PAHs exhibit strong fluorescence and can be regenerated by simply neutralization with triethylamine. The enhanced emission of mono&#8208;protonated products stem from S2&#8594;S0 transitions, which disobey the Kasha's rule.</dc:description>

         <title>Establishing Family Relations in Group 15 Halogenido Metalates with the Largest Molecular Antimony Iodide Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of five iodido antimonates with structurally very similar anions has been prepared, and the influence of the anion's size on the band gap and the presence of additional charge&#8208;transfer effects was investigated.







Abstract
Studying structurally related families of compounds is a valuable tool in understanding and predicting material properties and has been extensively used for metal halide perovskites. Due to the variable anion structures in group 15 halogenido metalates, similar family relations are still largely missing. Herein, we present compounds featuring the [Sb2nI6n+4]4&#8722; family of anions, including the first n=5 member in [Hpyz]4[Sb10I34] (Hpyz=pyrazinium), which contains the largest halogenido pentelate anion reported to date. The optical properties of compounds featuring n=1&#8211;5 anions show a clear trend as well as an outlier, a low band gap of 1.72&#8197;eV for [Hpyz]4[Sb10I34], that can be well understood using quantum chemical investigations. Also using SbI3 and [H2NMe2]3[SbI6], a compound featuring a single octahedral [SbI6]3&#8722; unit, as limiting cases, we show that structure&#8208;property relationships can be established in group 15 halogenido metalates in a similar way as in metal halide perovskites, thus providing a framework for understanding new and known compounds in this emerging class of materials.

         <title>Simultaneous Loading of Ni2P Cocatalysts on the Inner and Outer Surfaces of Mesopores P&#8208;Doped Carbon Nitride Hollow Spheres for Enhanced Photocatalytic Water&#8208;Splitting Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni2P cocatalysts were simultaneously loaded on the inner and outer surfaces of mesoporous P&#8208;doped carbon nitride hollow nanospheres to boost photocatalytic water splitting. The obtained Ni2P@PCNHS@Ni2P shows a significantly improved photocatalytic water splitting performance and enhanced atomic utilization. The findings guide the design of composite photocatalysts and the better utilization of hollow nanostructured semiconductors for photocatalysis.







Abstract
Promoting charge separation, constructing active sites, and improving the utilization of metal atoms are very important for the design of efficient photocatalysts. A simultaneous loading of Ni2P cocatalysts on the inner and outer surfaces of mesoporous P&#8208;doped carbon nitride hollow nanospheres (PCNHS) to construct a Ni2P@PCNHS@Ni2P photocatalyst is reported. Ni2P cocatalysts loading provides enough active sites on both the inner and outer surfaces for proton reduction, and the formed heterojunctions simultaneously promote the migration and separation of the photogenerated charges on the inner and outer surfaces. The photocatalytic reaction proceeds simultaneously on the inner and outer surfaces of Ni2P@PCNHS@Ni2P, which leads to a significantly improved photocatalytic water splitting performance and enhanced atomic utilization. Notably, the hydrogen evolution rate of Ni2P@PCNHS@Ni2P is 2.4 times higher than that of Pt&#8208;loaded PCNHS. The findings guide the design of hollow nanostructured composites with high&#8208;boosting photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Calcium Hydride Cation Dimer Catalyzed Hydrogenation of Unactivated 1&#8208;Alkenes and H2 Isotope Exchange: Competitive Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca Bridges and Terminal Ca&#8722;H Bonds</title>

Calcium hydride cation dimer catalysis: Dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT calculations reveal that the same double Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridged calcium hydride cation dimer catalyst [LCaH2CaL]2+&#8901;THF shows a novel substrate&#8208;dependent catalytic activity, involving cooperative Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridges for efficient H2 isotope exchange, terminal Ca&#8722;H bond for the Markovnikov addition of conjugation&#8208;activated styrene, and competitive Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridges and terminal Ca&#8722;H bonds for the anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition of unactivated 1&#8208;alkenes.







Abstract
Recently, it was shown that the double Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridged calcium hydride cation dimer complex [LCaH2CaL]2+ (macrocyclic ligand L=NNNN&#8208;tetradentate Me4TACD) exhibited remarkable activity in catalyzing the hydrogenation of unactivated 1&#8208;alkenes as well as the H2 isotope exchange under mild conditions, tentatively via the terminal Ca&#8722;H bond of cation monomer LCaH+. In this DFT mechanistic work, a novel substrate&#8208;dependent catalytic mechanism is disclosed involving cooperative Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridges for H2 isotope exchange, competitive Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridges and terminal Ca&#8722;H bonds for anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition of unactivated 1&#8208;alkenes, and terminal Ca&#8722;H bonds for Markovnikov addition of conjugation&#8208;activated styrene.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Calcium hydride cation dimer catalysis&lt;/b&gt;: Dispersion-corrected DFT calculations reveal that the same double Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridged calcium hydride cation dimer catalyst [LCaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CaL]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8901;THF shows a novel substrate-dependent catalytic activity, involving cooperative Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridges for efficient H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; isotope exchange, terminal Ca&#8722;H bond for the Markovnikov addition of conjugation-activated styrene, and competitive Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridges and terminal Ca&#8722;H bonds for the anti-Markovnikov addition of unactivated 1-alkenes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, it was shown that the double Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridged calcium hydride cation dimer complex [LCaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CaL]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (macrocyclic ligand L=NNNN-tetradentate Me&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TACD) exhibited remarkable activity in catalyzing the hydrogenation of unactivated 1-alkenes as well as the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; isotope exchange under mild conditions, tentatively via the terminal Ca&#8722;H bond of cation monomer LCaH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. In this DFT mechanistic work, a novel substrate-dependent catalytic mechanism is disclosed involving cooperative Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridges for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; isotope exchange, competitive Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridges and terminal Ca&#8722;H bonds for anti-Markovnikov addition of unactivated 1-alkenes, and terminal Ca&#8722;H bonds for Markovnikov addition of conjugation-activated styrene. THF-coordination plays a key role in favoring the anti-Markovnikov addition while strong cation-&#960; interactions direct the Markovnikov addition to terminal Ca&#8722;H bonds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inter&#8208;Network Charge&#8208;Transfer Excited State Formation Within a Two&#8208;fold Catenated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two electronically complementary linkers of the same framework are a well&#8208;studied pathway to achieve the photo&#8208;excited charge transfer state in a framework structure. Here, we show a mostly undiscovered strategy, how intercatenated metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) endows ground&#8208;state donor&#8208;acceptor interaction from two networks of the same framework to facilitate the inter&#8208;net charge&#8208;transfer excited state through direct photo&#8208;excitation rendering the possibility in the energy conversion scheme.







Abstract
Charge&#8208;transfer excited state (CTES) defines the ability to split photon energy into work producing redox equivalents suitable for photocatalysis. Here, we report inter&#8208;net CTES formation within a two&#8208;fold catenated crystalline metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), constructed with two linkers, N,N&#8242;&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenetetracarboxydiimide (DPNDI) and 2,6&#8208;dicarboxynaphthalene (NDC). The structural flexibility puts two complementary linkers from two nets in a proximal position to interact strongly. Supported by the electrochemical and steady&#8208;state electronic spectroscopic data, this ground&#8208;state interaction facilitates forming CTES that can be populated by direct excitation. We map the dynamics of the CTES which persists over a few nanoseconds and highlight the utilities of such relatively long&#8208;lived CTES as enhanced conductivity of the MOF under light over that measured in dark and as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;principle test, photo&#8208;reduction of methyl viologen under white light.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Resonant Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent (MR&#8208;TADF) Compounds as Photocatalysts
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) compounds, DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa, are shown to be excellent photocatalysts in a range of different reactions, benchmarked against the widely used donor&#8208;acceptor TADF photocatalyst, 4CzIPN. Advantages of using these MR&#8208;TADF photocatalysts include robust and inexpensive photocatalyst synthesis, lower required photocatalyst loadings and faster reaction rates, while achieving comparable or improved product yields.







Abstract
Donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) compounds, such as 4CzIPN, have become a widely used sub&#8208;class of organic photocatalysts for a plethora of photocatalytic reactions. Multi&#8208;resonant TADF (MR&#8208;TADF) compounds, a subclass of TADF emitters that are rigid nanographene derivatives, such as DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa, have to date not been explored as photocatalysts. In this study both DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa were found to give comparable or better product yield than 4CzIPN in a range of photocatalytic processes that rely upon reductive quenching, oxidative quenching, energy transfer and dual photocatalytic processes. In a model oxidative quench process, DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa gave increased reaction rates in comparison to 4CzIPN, with DiKTa being of particular interest due to the lower material cost (&#163;0.94/mmol) compared to that of 4CzIPN (&#163;3.26/mmol). These results suggest that DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa would be excellent additions to any chemist's collection of photocatalysts.

         <title>Neutral Boryl Radicals in Mixed&#8208;Valent B(III)Br&#8208;B(II) Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two neutral boryl radicals containing intramolecular mixed&#8208;valent B(II)Br&#8208;B(III) adducts were prepared by one&#8208;electron reduction of biphenylene and 9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene substituted haloboranes. The radical features a large spin density on the boron center and its stabilization is assisted by a weak B(III)Br&#8208;B(II) &#963; interaction.







Abstract
The general strategies to stabilize a boryl radical involve single electron delocalization by &#960;&#8208;system and the steric hinderance from bulky groups. Herein, a new class of boryl radicals is reported, with intramolecular mixed&#8208;valent B(III)Br&#8208;B(II) adducts ligated by a cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC). The radicals feature a large spin density on the boron center, which is ascertained by EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Structural and computational analyses revealed that the stability of radical species was assisted by the CAAC ligand and a weak but significant B(III)Br&#8208;B(II) interaction, suggesting a cooperative avenue for stabilization of boryl radicals. Two&#8208;electron reduction of these new boryl radicals provides C&#8722;H insertion products via a borylene intermediate.

         <title>Organic Crystals with Response to Multiple Stimuli: Mechanical Bending, Acid&#8208;Induced Bending and Heating&#8208;Induced Jumping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two polymorphs (Form O and Form R) of a Schiff base compound were found, which could respond reversibly to multiple stimuli (external force, acid, heat) by elastic bending, rolling and jumping.







Abstract
Multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive molecular crystals are attracting extensive attentions due to their potential as smart materials, such as molecular machines, actuators, and sensors. However, the task of giving a single crystal multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive properties remains extremely challenging. Herein, we found two polymorphs (Form O and Form R) of a Schiff base compound, which could respond to multiple stimuli (external force, acid, heat). Form O and Form R have different elastic deformability, which can be attributed to the differences in the molecular conformation, structural packing and intermolecular interactions. Moreover, both polymorphs exhibit reversible bending driven by volatile acid vapor, which we hypothesize is caused by reversible protonation reaction of imines with formic acid. In addition, jumping can be triggered by heating due to the significant anisotropic expansion. The integration of reversible bending and jumping into one single crystal expands the application scope of stimuli&#8208;responsive crystalline materials.

         <title>Design Concepts for Solution and Solid&#8208;State Emitters &#8211; A Modern Viewpoint on Classical and Non&#8208;Classical Approaches</title>

Shine a light! This Minireview shines a light on potential design strategies for luminophores with efficient emission in solution and the solid state. These so&#8208;called solution and solid&#8208;state emitters (SSSE) can be regarded as interplaying phenomena between the classic effects of aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE). Hence, they feature remarkable and ideally environmentally insensitive photophysical properties and will for sure find wide&#8208;ranging applications in the near future.







Abstract
For a long time, luminescence phenomena were strictly distinguished between the emission of isolated molecules in dilute solutions or close&#8208;packed structures such as in powders or aggregates. This changed with the breakthrough observation of dual&#8208;state efficient materials, which led to a rapid boost of publications examining the influence of structural features to achieve balanced emission with disregarded molecular surroundings. Some first general structural design concepts have already been proposed based on reoccurring patterns and pivotal motifs. However, we have found another way to classify these solution and solid&#8208;state emitters (SSSEs). Hence, this minireview aims to present an overview of published structural features of SSSEs while shining light on design concepts from a more generalized perspective. Since SSSEs are believed to bridge the gap of hitherto known aggregation&#8208;sensitive compound classes, we hope to give future scientists a versatile tool in hand to efficiently design novel luminescent materials.

         <title>Recognition&#8208;Induced Enhanced Emission of Core&#8208;Fluorescent ESIPT&#8208;type Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ESIPT&#8208;type resorcin[4]arenes are capable of guest&#8208;binding in the cavity and generate FL response with large Stokes shift and size&#8208;selective enhancement of emission via the mechanism that involves (a) selective di&#8208;deprotonation, (b) generation of emissive double keto tautomeric forms, and (c) recognition&#8208;induced restriction of intramolecular motion.







Abstract
Core&#8208;fluorescent cavitands based on 2&#8208;(2&#8242;&#8208;resorcinol)benzimidazole fluorophores (RBIs) merged with the resorcin[4]arene skeleton were designed and synthesized. The cavitands, due to the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonds and increased acidity, show excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and readily undergo deprotonation to form dianionic cavitands, capable of strong binding to organic cations. The changes in fluorescence are induced by deprotonation and binding events and involve huge Stokes shifts (due to emission from anionic double keto tautomers) and cation&#8208;selective enhancement of emission originating from the restriction of intramolecular motion (RIR) upon recognition in the cavity. Ab initio calculations indicate that the macrocyclic scaffold stabilizes the ground state tautomeric forms of the fluorophores that are not observed for non&#8208;macrocyclic analogs. In the excited state, the emitting forms for both macrocyclic scaffolds and non&#8208;macrocyclic analogs are anionic double keto tautomers, which are the result of excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) or excited state double proton transfer (ESDPT).

         <title>Interactive Bioconjugation at N&#8208;Terminal Cysteines by Using O&#8208;Salicylaldehyde Esters towards Dual Site&#8208;Selective Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;way protection: O&#8208;Salicylaldehyde esters are suitable handles for the site&#8208;specific protection of N&#8208;terminal cysteines on native peptides. The resulting phenolic thiazolidines present tunable stability through careful pH control that allows the orthogonal multifunctionalization of different Cys residues driven by interactive site&#8208;selective peptide modifications.







Abstract
N&#8208;terminal Cys modification has been intensively studied to produce homogeneous bioconjugates essentially through two modes of reaction: reversible modification with the equilibrium shifted towards the formation of the desired conjugate or stable and irreversible conjugates. Herein, we report a new method of N&#8208;terminal cysteine modification using O&#8208;salicylaldehyde esters (OSAEs) through fast conjugation and irreversible deconjugation. These reagents can rapidly react with N&#8208;terminal Cys at low&#8208;micromolar concentration to form thiazolidines with subsequent hydrolysis of the ester moiety to the phenolic derivative. These phenolic thiazolidines can be hydrolyzed at acidic pH (&#8776;4.5) to recover the intact N&#8208;terminal Cys. Bioconjugation reactions using OSAEs offer controlled reversibility to as act as a protecting group for N&#8208;terminal cysteines, allowing the modification of in&#8208;chain residues without perturbing the N&#8208;terminal Cys, which can then be deprotected and used as a conjugation site.

         <title>G&#8208;type Halohydrin Dehalogenases Catalyze Ring Opening Reactions of Cyclic Epoxides with Diverse Anionic Nucleophiles
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
G&#8208;type halohydrin dehalogenases convert 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered cyclic epoxides with a range of small anionic C&#8208;, N&#8208;, O&#8208; and S&#8208;nucleophiles.







Abstract
Halohydrin dehalogenases are promiscuous biocatalysts, which enable asymmetric ring opening reactions of epoxides with various anionic nucleophiles. However, despite the increasing interest in such asymmetric transformations, the substrate scope of G&#8208;type halohydrin dehalogenases toward cyclic epoxides has remained largely unexplored, even though this subfamily is the only one known to display activity with these sterically demanding substrates. Herein, we report on the exploration of the substrate scope of the two G&#8208;type halohydrin dehalogenases HheG and HheG2 and a newly identified, more thermostable member of the family, HheG3, with a variety of sterically demanding cyclic epoxides and anionic nucleophiles. This work shows that, in addition to azide and cyanide, these enzymes facilitate ring&#8208;opening reactions with cyanate, thiocyanate, formate, and nitrite, significantly expanding the known repertoire of accessible transformations.

         <title>Cobalt Cyclopentadienyl&#8208;Phosphine Dinitrogen Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By reducing cobalt chloride complexes under a dinitrogen atmosphere, cobalt dinitrogen complexes and binuclear cobalt tetra&#8208;dinitrogen complexes were formed. The cobalt dinitrogen complex could react with white phosphorus to afford a dinuclear cobalt complex bearing a cyclo&#8208;P4 moiety.







Abstract
By applying the potassium salts of cyclopentadienyl&#8208;phosphine ligands LK to CoCl2, the corresponding cobalt chlorides (1, LCoIICl) were prepared. By reducing complexes 1 with KHBEt3 under a N2 atmosphere, bridging end&#8208;on complexes, LCoI&#8722;N2&#8722;CoIL (2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b), were successfully obtained. 15N2&#8208;labeled [15N2]&#8208;2&#8201;a was prepared under 15N2/14N2 exchange in THF solution. LCoI&#8722;N2&#8722;CoIL complex 2&#8201;a could react with P4 molecules to release N2 and generate a Co&#8722;P4&#8722;Co moiety 4. Further reduction of complex 2&#8201;b led to cleavage of a P&#8722;C bond in the cyclopentadienyl&#8208;phosphine ligand to provide novel &#956;&#8208;PCy2&#8208;bridged Co0&#8722;N2 complex 5. DFT calculations confirmed the experimental observations.

         <title>Constructing Netlike Nanosheets of ZnO/BiOCl with Heterojunction as Robust Material for Electrochemical Amine Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnO/BiOCl heterojunction material is fabricated by constructing netlike ZnO and BiOCl nanosheets. It exhibits high selectivity to ammonia and detection limit is 0.25&#8197;&#956;M, which is suitable to detect volatile amines quantitatively. The synergetic effects of the heterojunction and netlike structures contribute to boosting electrochemical activity. The ZnO/BiOCl hybrid could be an promising candidate for detection and analysis.







Abstract
The electrochemical sensing is a potential method for detection of trace toxic substance. Herein, the heterojunction of netlike ZnO/BiOCl nanosheets was constructed for the enhanced electrochemical detection of ammonia. Cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry were used to investigate the electrochemical performance. The results show that the ZnO/BiOCl&#8208;modified electrode exhibits higher sensitivity towards ammonia compared with the ZnO and BiOCl&#8208;based electrodes, which is ascribed to band structure and fast electron transfer. The high response of 11.8&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;mM&#8722;1 and a low detection limit (LOD) of 0.25&#8197;&#956;M are achieved. In addition, the ZnO/BiOCl material exhibits high selectivity, repeatability and stability. The better linear relationship between concentration and current (R2=0.99) is significant for quantitative detection of ammonia, implying that netlike ZnO/BiOCl nanosheets can serve as electrochemical sensing platform for detecting toxic substance. This research provides a strategy for fabricating two&#8208;dimensional netlike materials and regulating heterojunctions used for electrochemical application.

         <title>Placing CF2 in the Center: Major Physicochemical Changes Upon a Minor Structural Alteration in Gem&#8208;Difunctional Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine atoms play an important role in all branches of chemistry and accordingly, it is very important to study their unique and varied effects systematically, in particular, the structure&#8208;physicochemical properties relationship. The present study describes exceptional physicochemical effects resulting from a H/F exchange at the methylene bridge of gem&#8208;difunctional compounds. The &#916;log  P  (CF2&#8208;CH2)  values, i.e. the change in lipophilicity, observed for the CH  2  /CF  2  replacement in various &#945;,&#945;&#8208;phenoxy&#8208; and thiophenoxy&#8208;esters/amides, diketones, benzodioxoles and more, fall in the range of 0.6&#8208;1.4 units, which for most cases, is far above the values expected for such a replacement. Moreover, for compounds holding more than one such gem&#8208;difunctional moiety, the effect is nearly additive, so one can switch from a hydrophilic compound to a lipophilic one in a limited number of H/F exchanges. DFT studies of some of these systems revealed that polarity, conformational prference as well as charge distributions are strongly affected by such hydrogen to fluorine atom substitution. The pronounced effects described, are a result of the interplay between changes in polarity, H&#8208;bond basicity and molecular volume, which were obtained with a very low &#8216;cost&#8217; in terms of molecular weight or steric effects and may have a great potential for implementation in various fields of chemical sciences.</dc:description>
