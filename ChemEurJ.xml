      <dc:description>Macroscopic supramolecular assembly (MSA) is a new concept in supramolecular science with focus on interfacial assembly of macroscopic building blocks, which has largely extended the applicable materials of supramolecular assembly and provided new solutions to fabricating tissue scaffolds, soft devices etc. The precision of assembled structures is widely concerned; unlike molecular assemblies, the MSA precision is highly dependent on the matching degree of assembled surfaces because of the large interactive area and group number, which resulted in remarkably increased kinetic possibility and metastable assemblies. This Concept introduces the principle, history and development of MSA, elaborates the low&#8208;precision challenge in MSA, summaries strategies of precise MSA based on different thermodynamic stability of precise/imprecise structures and control over assembly kinetics, and finally demonstrates applications of precise MSA structures in advanced manufacture such as tissue scaffolds.</dc:description>

      <title>Ferroelectric Metal&#8208;Organic Framework as a Host Material for Sulfur to Alleviate the Shuttle Effect of Lithium&#8722;Sulfur Battery</title>
      <dc:description>Ferroelectric has an excellent reversible polarization conversion behavior under external electric field. Herein, we propose an interesting strategy to alleviate the shuttle effect of lithium&#8208;sulfur battery by utilizing ferroelectric metal&#8208;organic framework (FMOF) as a host material for the first time. Compared to other MOF with same structure but without ferroelectricity and commercial carbon black, the cathode based on FMOF exhibits a low capacity decay and high cycling stability. These results demonstrate that the polarization switching behaviors of FMOF under the discharge voltage of lithium&#8208;sulfur battery can effectively trap polysulfides by polar&#8211;polar interactions, decrease polysulfides shuttle and improve the electrochemical performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur battery.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>MOF&#8208;driven synthesis is considered as a promising alternative for the development of new catalytic materials with well&#8208;designed active sites. This synthetic approach is used here to gradually transform a new bimetallic MOF, composed of Pd and Fe as metal components, via the  in situ  generation of aniline under mild conditions. This methodology results in a compositionally homogeneous nanocomposite formed by Fe&#8208;doped Pd nanoparticles and these, in turn, supported on an iron oxide&#8208;doped carbon. The nanocomposite has been fully characterized by several techniques such as IR, Raman, TEM, XPS, XAS, among others.

      <title>Modulating Hierarchical Micro/Mesoporosity by a Mixed Solvent Approach in Al&#8208;MOF: Stabilization of MAPbBr3 Quantum Dots</title>
      <dc:description>Various hierarchical micro/mesoporous MOFs based on {[Al(&#181;&#8208;OH)(1,4&#8208;NDC)]&#8226;H  2  O} (  MOF1  ) with tunable porosities (pore volume and surface area) have been synthesized by assembling Al(III) and 1,4&#8208;NDC (1,4&#8208;Naphthalenedicarboxylate) under microwave irradiation by varying ethanol/water solvent ratio. Water/ethanol mixture has played a crucial role in the mesopore generation in  MOF1M  25  , MOF1M  50  ,  and  MOF1M  75  , which is achieved by  in situ  formation of water/ethanol clusters. By adjusting the ratio of water&#8208;ethanol, the particle size, surface area and micro/mesopore volume fraction of the MOFs are controlled. Furthermore, reaction time also plays a critical role in mesopore formation as realized by varying reaction time for the MOF with 50% ethanol (  MOF1M  50  ). Additionally, hierarchical MOF (  MOF1M  50  ) has been used as a template for the stabilization of MAPbBr  3  (MA = methylammonium) perovskite quantum dots (PQDs). MAPbBr  3  PQDs are grown inside  MOF1M  50  , where mesopores control the size of PQDs which leads to quantum confinement.</dc:description>

      <title>Homo&#8208; and heterodinuclear arene&#8208;linked osmium(II) and ruthenium(II) organometallics: probing the impact of metal variation on reactivity and biological activity</title>
      <dc:description>Dinuclear metallodrugs offer much potential in the development of novel anticancer chemotherapeutics as a result of the distinct interactions possible with biomacromolecular targets and the unique biological activity that can result. Here, we describe the development of isostructural homodinuclear Os(II)&#8208;Os(II) and heterodinuclear Os(II)&#8208;Ru(II) organometallic complexes formed from the linking of the arene ligands of [M(&#951;6&#8208;arene)(C2O4)(PTA)] (M = Os/Ru; PTA = 1,3,5&#8208;triaza&#8208;7&#8208;phosphaadamantane) units. Together with the known Ru(II)&#8208;Ru(II) analogue, a chromatin&#8208;modifying agent, we probed the impact of variation of the metal ions on the structure, reactivity and biological activity of these complexes. The complexes have been structurally characterised by X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments, their stability and reactivity examined using  1H and  31P NMR spectroscopy and biological activity assessed, alongside mononuclear analogues, through MTT assays and cell cycle analysis (HT&#8208;29 cell line). Results revealed high antiproliferative activity in each case with cell cycle profiles of the dinuclear complexes found to be similar to that for untreated cells, and similar but distinct profiles for the mononuclear complexes. These results indicate these complexes impact on cell viability predominantly through a non&#8208;DNA damaging mechanism of action. The new Os(II)&#8208;Os(II and Os(II)&#8208;Ru(II) complexes reported here are further examples of a family of compounds operating via mechanism(s) of action atypical of the majority of metallodrugs, and which have potential as tools in chromatin research.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The synthesis of linear symmetric ethynyl&#8208; and acetylide&#8208; amidinates of the coinage metals is presented. Starting with the desilylation of the complexes [Me3SiC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}M2] (Dipp = 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) (M = Cu, Au) it is demonstrated that this compound class is suitable to serve as a versatile metalloligand. Deprotonation with n&#8208;butyllithium and subsequent salt metathesis reactions yield symmetric tetranuclear gold(I) acetylide complexes of the form [{(PPh3)AuC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2M2] (M = Cu, Au). The corresponding Ag complex [{(PPh3)AuC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Ag2] was obtained by a different route via metal rearrangement. All compounds show bright blue or blue&#8208;green microsecond long phosphorescence in the solid state, hence their photophysical properties were thoroughly investigated in a temperature range of 20 &#8211; 295 K. Emission quantum yields of up to 41% at room temperature were determined. Furthermore, similar emissions with quantum yields of 15% were observed for the two most brightly luminescent complexes in thf solution.</dc:description>

      <title>Polypyridyl&#8208;Based Copper Phenanthrene Complexes: Combining Stability with Enhanced DNA Recognition</title>
      <dc:description>We report a series of copper(II) artificial metallo&#8208;nucleases (AMNs) and demonstrate their DNA damaging properties and in vitro cytotoxicity against human&#8208;derived pancreatic cancer cells. The compounds combine a tris&#8208;chelating polypyridyl ligand,  di  &#8208;(2&#8208;pycolyl)amine (DPA), and a DNA intercalating phenanthrene unit. Their general formula is Cu&#8208;DPA&#8208;N,N&#180; (where N,N&#180; = 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (Phen), dipyridoquinoxaline (DPQ) or dipyridophenazine (DPPZ)). Characterisation was achieved by X&#8208;ray crystallography and continuous&#8208;wave EPR (cw&#8208;EPR), hyperfine sublevel correlation (HYSCORE) and Davies electron&#8211;nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopies. The presence of the DPA ligand enhances solution stability and facilitates enhanced DNA recognition with apparent binding constants (  K  app  ) rising from 10  5  to 10  7  M  &#8208;1  with increasing extent of planar phenanthrene. Cu&#8208;DPA&#8208;DPPZ, the complex with greatest DNA binding and intercalation effects, recognises the minor groove of guanine&#8208;cytosine (G&#8208;C) rich sequences. Oxidative DNA damage also occurs in the minor groove and can be inhibited by superoxide and hydroxyl radical trapping agents. The complexes, particularly Cu&#8208;DPA&#8208;DPPZ, display promising anticancer activity against human pancreatic tumour cells with in vitro results surpassing the clinical platinum(II) drug oxaliplatin.</dc:description>

      <title>Electron storage capability and singlet oxygen productivity of a Ru(II) photosensitizer containing a fused naphthaloylenebenzene moiety at the 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligand</title>
      <dc:description>As a novel rylene type dye a diimine ligand with a fully rigid and extended &#960;&#8208;system in its backbone was prepared by directly fusing a 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline building block with 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide. The corresponding heteroleptic ruthenium photosensitizer bearing one biipo and two tbbpy ligands was synthesized and extensively analyzed by a combination of NMR, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, steady&#8208;state absorption and emission, time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy and different electrochemical measurements supported by time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations. The cyclic and differential pulse voltammograms revealed, that the naphthaloylene&#8208;benzene moiety enables an additional second reduction of the ligand. Moreover, this ligand possesses a very broad absorption in the visible region. In the Ru(II) complex this causes an overlap of ligand&#8208;centered and metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer transitions. The emission of the complex is clearly redshifted compared to the ligand emission with very long&#8208;lived excited states lifetimes of 1.7 and 24.7 &#181;s in oxygen&#8208;free acetonitrile solution. This behavior is accompanied by a surprisingly high oxygen sensitivity. Finally, this photosensitizer was successfully applied for the effective evolution of singlet oxygen challenging some of the common Ru(II) prototype complexes.</dc:description>

      <title>Probing the origin of adaptive aromaticity in 16&#8208;valence&#8208;electron metallapentalenes</title>
      <dc:description>Species with adaptive aromaticity are aromatic in the ground and lowest&#8208;lying triplet excited states and they have normally intermediate singlet&#8208;triplet gaps. Few examples of compounds with adaptive aromaticity are known to date, including 16&#8208;valence&#8208;electron (16e) metallapentalenes. A sweeping search could be conducted to discover new members of this group, but efficient designs with an explicit strategy would facilitate the quest for new members of this elusive family. Density functional theory calculations and aromaticity evaluations have been performed to reveal the nature of triplet&#8208;state aromaticity in 16e metallapentalenes. Our results show that coordination of strong &#963;&#8208; or &#960;&#8208;donor ligands helps achieving adaptive aromaticity of 16e metallapentalenes by means of a spin delocalization mechanism. These results have important implications for understanding the unusual properties of the organometallic adaptive aromatics, leading the way to efficient design of new compounds with tunable singlet&#8208;triplet gaps.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
C&#8722;H activation with cyclopentadienyl complexes: Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization reactions with Cp*MIII catalysts (M=Co, Rh, Ir) have found a wide variety of applications in organic synthesis. Albeit the intrinsic difficulties in achieving catalytic stereocontrol using these catalysts due to their lack of additional coordination sites for external chiral ligands and the conformational flexibility of the Cp ligand, catalytic enantioselective C&#8722;H functionalization reactions using the Group&#8197;9 metal triad with Cp&#8208;type ligands have been intensively studied since 2012. In this Minireview on page&#8197;7346&#8197;ff., T. Yoshino, S. Satake and S. Matsunaga summarize and discuss the progress in these reactions according to the type of the chiral catalyst used. The development of chiral Cpx ligands and their metal complexes, artificial metalloenzymes, chiral carboxylate&#8208;assisted enantioselective C&#8722;H activations, enantioselective alkylations assisted by chiral carboxylic acids or chiral sulfonates, and chiral transient directing groups are discussed.

      <title>Dibenzothiophenesulfilimines: A Convenient Approach to Intermolecular Rhodium&#8208;Catalysed C&#8722;H Amidation</title>
      <dc:description>
Simple, stable, cheap: N&#8208;Sulfonyl and N&#8208;acyl dibenzothiophene&#8208;based sulfilimines were utilised as transfer reagents in rhodium&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H amidation reactions. This method allows the efficient and economic monoamidation of substrates bearing different directing groups and differently hybridised C&#8722;H bonds. It can further be expanded to the use of other Group&#8197;9 transition&#8208;metal catalysts (see scheme).







Abstract
A sulfilimine&#8208;based Group&#8197;9 transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H amidation procedure is reported. Dibenzothiophene&#8208;based sulfilimines were shown to constitute a class of novel amidation reagents which enable the transfer of a wide range of N&#8208;sulfonyl and N&#8208;acyl moieties. It was demonstrated that sulfilimines, which are easily accessible from cheap reagents, are safe&#8208;to&#8208;handle and represent broadly applicable amidation reagents. The dibenzothiophene can be recycled after use. The C&#8722;H amidation was shown to proceed with high selectivity and gave the mono&#8208;amidated products, mostly in good to excellent yields.

Formylpyrrolidine (FPyr) and trichlorotriazine (TCT), which is a cost&#8208;efficient commodity chemical, enable this decarbonylation. Utilization of dimethylformamide (DMF) as solvent and catalyst even allows for a rapid CO generation at room temperature. Application towards four different carbonylative cross coupling protocols demonstrates the high synthetic utility and versatility of the new approach. Remarkably, this also comprehends a carbonylative Sonogashira reaction at room temperature employing intrinsically difficult electron&#8208;deficient aryl iodides. Commercial 13C&#8208;enriched formic acid facilitates the production of radiolabeled compounds as exemplified by the pharmaceutical Moclobemide. Finally, comparative experiments verified that the present method is highly superior to other protocols for the activation of carboxylic acids.</dc:description>

Organic photoredox catalyst, 4CzIPN (1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicyanobenzene), induces single electron transfer (SET) from azide N3&#8722; and generates azide radical N3&#8226;. The photogenerated N3&#8226; abstracts H atom from &#945;&#8208;C&#8211;H bond of benzylic system, which provides aldehyde and hydrazoic acid (HN3) in situ. This reaction subsequently forms azido alcohol intermediate that transforms into nitrile with the assistance of triflic acid (Br&#248;nsted acid). A range of alcohols and methyl arenes successfully underwent cyanation at room temperature with good to excellent yields and showed good functional group tolerance.</dc:description>

      <title>Fluorinated&#8208;PLGA Nanoparticles for Enhanced Drug Encapsulation and 19F&#8208;NMR Detection</title>
      <dc:description>In the continuous search to develop multimodal systems with combined diagnostic and therapeutic functions, several efforts have been focused on the development of multifunctional drug delivery systems. Herein we designed, by a covalent approach, a novel class of fluorinated poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) co&#8208;polymers (F&#8208;PLGA) containing an increasing number of magnetically equivalent fluorine atoms. In particular, two novel compounds, F  3  &#8208;PLGA and F  9  &#8208;PLGA, were synthesized and their chemical structure and thermal stability were analysed by solution NMR, DSC, and TGA. The obtained F&#8208;PLGA compounds were proved to form in aqueous solution colloidal stable nanoparticles (NPs) displaying a strong  19  F&#8208;NMR signal. The fluorinated NPs also showed an enhanced ability to load hydrophobic drugs containing fluorine atoms with respect to analogue pristine PLGA NPs.

      <title>Degeneracy of the antithrombin binding sequence in heparin: 2&#8208;O&#8208;sulfated Iduronic acid can replace the critical glucuronic acid.</title>
      <dc:description>Heparin binds to and activates antithrombin (AT) through a specific pentasaccharide sequence in which a trisaccharide subsite, containing glucuronic acid (GlcA), has been considered as the initiator in the recognition of the polysaccharide by the protein. More recently it was suggested that sulfated iduronic acid (IdoA2S) could replace this &#8220;canonical&#8221; GlcA. Indeed, a heparin octasaccharidic sequence obtained by chemoenzymatic synthesis, in which GlcA is replaced by IdoA2S has been found to similarly bind to and activate antithrombin. Using Saturation&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Difference NMR, NOEs, transfer NMR and Molecular Dynamics, we show that upon binding to AT this IdoA2S unit develops comparable interactions with AT as GlcA. Interestingly, two IdoA2S units, both present in a 1C4 &#8208; 2S0 equilibrium in the unbound saccharide, respectively shift to full 2S0 and full 1C4 upon binding to antithrombin, providing the best illustration of the critical role of iduronic acid conformational flexibility in biological systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Membrane Microreactors for the On&#8208;Demand Generation, Separation and Reaction of Gases</title>
      <dc:description>The use of gases as reagents in organic synthesis can be very challenging, particularly at a laboratory scale. This Concept takes into account recent studies to make the case that gases can indeed be efficiently and safely formed from relatively inexpensive commercially available reagents for use in a wide range of organic transformations. In particular, we argue that the exploitation of continuous flow membrane reactors enables the effective separation of the chemistry necessary for gas formation from the chemistry for gas consumption, with these two stages often containing incompatible chemistry. The approach outlined eliminates the need to store and transport excessive amounts of potentially toxic, reactive or explosive gases. The on &#8208;demand generation, separation and reaction of a number of gases, including carbon monoxide, diazomethane, trifluoromethyl diazomethane, hydrogen cyanide, ammonia and formaldehyde, is discussed.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of aluminophosphate molecular sieves in the alkaline media</title>
      <dc:description>Unlike conventional aluminosilicates zeolites synthesized in the alkaline media, aluminophosphate molecular sieves (AlPOs) were always prepared under the acidic conditions in the past three decades, which have been regarded as one of essential factors except for the case of silica substituted analogues (SAPOs). For the first time, we demonstrate here a simple and generalized route for synthesizing various types of aluminophosphate molecular sieves in the alkaline media. A series of aluminophosphate sieves and their analogues have been prepared with different quaternary ammonium cations as structure&#8208;directing agents in this manner. The above successes have extended the systematic media from acidic or neural to alkaline for preparation of a series of aluminophosphate molecular sieves, which possibly open an alternative door for synthesis of aluminophosphate molecular sieves.</dc:description>

The above successes have extended the systematic media from acidic or neural to alkaline for preparation of a series of aluminophosphate molecular sieves, which possibly open an alternative door for synthesis of aluminophosphate molecular sieves.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The diversity of a polyclonal FluCell&#8208;SELEX library outperforms individual aptamers as emerging diagnostic tools for identification of carbapenem resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa</title>

      <title>One Way Traffic: Base&#8208;to&#8208;Backbone Hole Transfer in Nucleoside Phosphorodithioate</title>
      <dc:description>
Tracking holes: The nature and directionality of the hole&#8208;transfer pathways in phosphorodithioate systems and identification of the radicals involved was achieved by employing a unique combination of synthesis, ESR spectroscopic studies in frozen aqueous solution at low temperature, pulse radiolysis in aqueous solution at room temperature, and ab initio DFT calculations.







Abstract
The directionality of the hole&#8208;transfer processes between DNA backbone and base was investigated by using phosphorodithioate [P(S&#8722;)=S] components. ESR spectroscopy in homogeneous frozen aqueous solutions and pulse radiolysis in aqueous solution at ambient temperature confirmed initial formation of G.+&#8208;P(S&#8722;)=S. The ionization potential of G&#8208;P(S&#8722;)=S was calculated to be slightly lower than that of guanine in 5&#8242;&#8208;dGMP. Subsequent thermally activated hole transfer from G.+ to P(S&#8722;)=S led to dithiyl radical (P&#8208;2S.) formation on the &#956;s timescale. In parallel, ESR spectroscopy, pulse radiolysis, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed P&#8208;2S. formation in an abasic phosphorodithioate model compound. ESR investigations at low temperatures and higher G&#8208;P(S&#8722;)=S concentrations showed a bimolecular conversion of P&#8208;2S. to the &#963;2&#8208;&#963;*1&#8208;bonded dimer anion radical [&#8208;P&#8208;2S

2S&#8208;P&#8208;]&#8722; formation was not observed by pulse radiolysis [&#916;G&#176; (298&#8197;K, DFT)=&#8722;1.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1]. Neither P&#8208;2S. nor [&#8208;P&#8208;2S

      <dc:description>Photocatalytic CO2  reduction is a revolutionary approach to solve imminent energy and environmental issues by replicating the ingenuity of nature. The past decade has witnessed an impetus in the rise of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structure materials as advanced nanomaterials to boost photocatalytic activities.

This review article presents a diverse range of alterations and compositions derived from 2D carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials, mainly graphene and graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4), which have remarkably ameliorated the photocatalytic CO2  performance. Herein, the rational design of the photocatalyst systems with consideration on the aspect of dimensionality and the resultant heterostructures at the interface are systematically analyzed to elucidate an insightful perspective on this pacey subject.

      <title>Ionic Dissociation of SiCl4: Formation of [SiL6]Cl4 with L=Dimethylphosphinic Acid</title>
      <dc:description>
Ionic dissociation of SiCl4: The first example of a structurally characterized tetra&#8208;cationic hexacoordinated silicon tetrachloride is reported. It was obtained by reaction of dimethylphosphinic acid with SiCl4 under ambient conditions. Additionally, the structure of a cyclic dimeric hexacoordinated silicon complex was determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and verified by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Reactions of SiCl4 with R2PO(OH) (R=Me, Cl) yield compounds with six&#8208;fold coordinated silicon atoms. Whereas R=Me afforded the hexacoordinated tetra&#8208;cationic silicon complex [Si(Me2PO(OH))6]4+ with chloride counter&#8208;ions, R=Cl caused release of HCl with formation of a cyclic dimeric silicon complex [Si(Cl2PO(OH))(Cl2PO2)3(&#956;&#8208;Cl2PO2)]2 with bridging bidentate dichlorophosphates.

      <title>DNA Nucleobase Under Ionizing Radiation: Unexpected Proton Transfer by Thymine Cation in Water Nanodroplets</title>
      <dc:description>The effects of ionizing radiation on DNA constituents is a widely studied fundamental process using experimental and computational techniques. In particular radiation effects on nucleobases are usually tackled by mass spectrometry in which the nucleobase is embedded in a water nanodroplet. Here we present a multiscale theoretical study revealing the effects and the dynamics of water droplets towards neutral and ionized thymine. In particular, by using both hybrid quantum mechanics molecular mechanics and fully ab initio molecular dynamics we reveal an unexpected proton transfer from thymine cation to a nearby water molecule. This leads to the formation of a neutral radical thymine and a Zundel structure, while the hydrated proton localizes at the interface between the deprotonated thymine and the water droplet. This observation opens entirely novel perspective concerning the reactivity and further fragmentation of ionized nucleobases.</dc:description>

      <title>In&#8208;situ construction of Pt&#8208;Ni NF@Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 for selective hydrogenation of p&#8208;nitrostyrene by ammonia borane</title>
      <dc:description>Pt&#8208;Ni nanoframes (Pt&#8208;Ni NFs) exhibit outstanding catalytic for varied reactions owing to the large numbers of exposed surface active sites, but its stability and selectivity need to be improved. Herein, we reported an in&#8208;situ method for construction of a core@shell structured Pt&#8208;Ni NF@Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 using Pt&#8208;Ni rhombic dodecahedral as self&#8208;sacrificial template, finding that the sample exhibits not only 100% conversion for the selective hydrogenation of p&#8208;nitrostyrene to p&#8208;aminostyrene conducted at room temperature, but also good selectivity (92%) and high stability (no activity loss after fifteen runs) during the reaction. This is attributed to the Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 shell in situ formed in the preparation process, which can stabilize the evolved Pt&#8208;Ni NF and donate electrons to the Pt metals that facilitate the preferential adsorption of electrophilic &#8211;NO  2  group. This study provides a new vista to design highly active, selective and stable noble metal containing materials for selective hydrogenation reactions.</dc:description>

Herein, we reported an in&#8208;situ method for construction of a core@shell structured Pt&#8208;Ni NF@Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 using Pt&#8208;Ni rhombic dodecahedral as self&#8208;sacrificial template, finding that the sample exhibits not only 100% conversion for the selective hydrogenation of p&#8208;nitrostyrene to p&#8208;aminostyrene conducted at room temperature, but also good selectivity (92%) and high stability (no activity loss after fifteen runs) during the reaction. This is attributed to the Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 shell in situ formed in the preparation process, which can stabilize the evolved Pt&#8208;Ni NF and donate electrons to the Pt metals that facilitate the preferential adsorption of electrophilic &#8211;NO  2  group. This study provides a new vista to design highly active, selective and stable noble metal containing materials for selective hydrogenation reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Post&#8208;Lithium Ion Battery Era: Recent Advances in Rechargeable Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Lithium shortage and growing demand for electricity storage encourage researchers to look for new alternative energy storage materials. Due to the abundant potassium resources, similar redox potential to lithium metal and low cost, potassium ion batteries (PIBs), as one of the promising alternatives, are applied in energy storage research recently. However, PIBs do not have adequate competition in their electrochemical efficiency because the molar volume of potassium ions is higher than those in lithium and sodium ions.

The latest developments in electrode materials for PIBs&#160;have been outlined in depth in this review.

      <title>Scalable Hybrid Synthetic/Biocatalytic Route to Psilocybin</title>
      <dc:description>
The benefits of bulk: Future use of psilocybin as a medication will entail increased demand. We present a gram&#8208;scale synthetic/biocatalytic approach in which the mushroom kinase PsiK replaces tedious chemical phosphorylation. A pilot&#8208;scale protocol to make three&#8208;digit milligram amounts of pure and active recombinant PsiK available is also described.







Abstract
Psilocybin, the principal indole alkaloid of Psilocybe mushrooms, is currently undergoing clinical trials as a medication against treatment&#8208;resistant depression and major depressive disorder. The psilocybin supply for pharmaceutical purposes is met by synthetic chemistry. We replaced the problematic phosphorylation step during synthesis with the mushroom kinase PsiK. This enzyme was biochemically characterized and used to produce one gram of psilocybin from psilocin within 20 minutes. We also describe a pilot&#8208;scale protocol for recombinant PsiK that yielded 150&#8197;mg enzyme in active and soluble form. Our work consolidates the simplicity of tryptamine chemistry with the specificity and selectivity of enzymatic catalysis and helps provide access to an important drug at potentially reasonable cost.

      <dc:description>
Visibly simple: Low&#8208;energy visible&#8208;light from a blue LED induced operationally simple and efficient coupling of &#946;&#8208;ketothioamides with &#945;&#8208;diazo 1,3&#8208;diketones occurs under photocatalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free conditions. The chemoselective S&#8208;alkylation followed by intramolecular N&#8208;cyclization of &#946;&#8208;ketothioamides with electrophilic carbenes generated in situ enabled the formation of densely functionalized thiazolines in excellent yields.







Abstract
A photocatalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free, visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated chemoselective domino protocol was devised to access fully substituted thiazoline derivatives from &#946;&#8208;ketothioamides and &#945;&#8208;diazo 1,3&#8208;diketones at moderate temperature in open air. The reaction proceeds through in situ generation of electrophilic carbenes from &#945;&#8208;diazo 1,3&#8208;diketones by a low&#8208;energy blue LED (448&#8197;nm), which undergoes selective coupling with nucleophilic &#946;&#8208;ketothioamides to give thiazolines by successive formation of C&#8722;S and C&#8722;N bonds in one stretch. Notably, the benign and clean conditions, operational simplicity, sustainability, 100&#8201;% carbon economy, high yields, and wide functional&#8208;group tolerance are further attributes of the strategy. A mechanistic rationale for this cascade reaction sequence is well supported by control experiments.

Abstract
Free base, zinc and palladium &#960;&#8208;extended porphyrins containing fused naphthalenediamide units were employed as photosensitizers in antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT). Their efficacy, assessed by photophysical and in vitro photobiological studies on Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, was found to depend on metal coordination, showing a dramatic enhancement of photosensitizing activity for the palladium complex.

      <title>A&#160;Six&#8211;Armed Phenhomazine Ligand with a Potential &#8220;Turn&#8211;Off&#8221; Copper(II) Sensing Capability through Terbium(III) Luminescence Quenching</title>
      <dc:description>Herein we describe the design, synthesis and characterization of a phenhomazine ligand with six pendant acetate arms designed for the combined coordination of copper(II) and lanthanide(III) ions, with the perspective of the development of a &#8220;turn&#8211;off&#8221; copper sensor. The key step for the ligand preparation was the one&#8211;step endomethylene bridge fission of a diamino Tr&#246;ger&#8217;s base with a concomitant alkylation. Fluorescence and absorption spectroscopies as well as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments were performed in order to analyze and understand the coordination properties of the ligand. Transition metal coordination was driven by the synergistic effect of the free nitrogen atoms of the diazocinic core and the two central acetate arms attached to those nitrogens, whereas lanthanide coordination is performed by external acetate arms, presumably forming a self&#8211;assembled 2:2 metallosupramolecular structure. The terbium complex shows the typical green emission with narrow bands and long luminescence lifetimes. The luminescence quenching produced by the presence of copper(II) ions was analyzed. This work sets therefore a starting point for the development of a phenhomazine&#8211;based &#8220;turn&#8211;off&#8221; copper(II) sensor.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Herein we describe the design, synthesis and characterization of a phenhomazine ligand with six pendant acetate arms designed for the combined coordination of copper(II) and lanthanide(III) ions, with the perspective of the development of a &#8220;turn&#8211;off&#8221; copper sensor. The key step for the ligand preparation was the one&#8211;step endomethylene bridge fission of a diamino Tr&#246;ger&#8217;s base with a concomitant alkylation. Fluorescence and absorption spectroscopies as well as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments were performed in order to analyze and understand the coordination properties of the ligand. Transition metal coordination was driven by the synergistic effect of the free nitrogen atoms of the diazocinic core and the two central acetate arms attached to those nitrogens, whereas lanthanide coordination is performed by external acetate arms, presumably forming a self&#8211;assembled 2:2 metallosupramolecular structure. The terbium complex shows the typical green emission with narrow bands and long luminescence lifetimes. The luminescence quenching produced by the presence of copper(II) ions was analyzed. This work sets therefore a starting point for the development of a phenhomazine&#8211;based &#8220;turn&#8211;off&#8221; copper(II) sensor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>An NMR&#8208;based biosensor to measure stereo&#8208;specific methionine sulfoxide reductase (MSR) activities in vitro and in vivo.</title>
      <dc:description>Oxidation of protein methionines to methionine&#8208;sulfoxides (MetOx) is associated with several age&#8208;related diseases. In healthy cells, MetOx is reduced to methionine by two families of conserved methionine sulfoxide reductase enzymes, MSRA and MSRB that specifically target the  S  &#8208; or  R  &#8208;diastereoisomers of methionine&#8208;sulfoxides, respectively. To directly interrogate MSRA and MSRB functions in cellular settings, we developed an NMR&#8208;based biosensor that we call CarMetOx to simultaneously measure both enzyme activities in single reaction setups. We demonstrate the suitability of our strategy to delineate MSR functions in complex biological environments, including cell lysates and live zebrafish embryos. Thereby, we establish differences in substrate specificities between prokaryotic and eukaryotic MSRs and introduce CarMetOx as a highly sensitive tool for studying therapeutic targets of oxidative stress&#8208;related human diseases and redox regulated signaling pathways.</dc:description>

      <title>Ultrabright terbium nanoparticles for FRET biosensing and in&#8208;situ imaging of epidermal growth factor receptors</title>
      <dc:description>Lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles (LnNPs) have become an important class of fluorophores for advanced biosensing and bioimaging. LnNPs that are photosensitized by surface&#8208;attached antenna ligands can possess exceptional brightness. However, their functional bioconjugation remains an important challenge for their translation into bioanalytical applications. To solve this problem, we designed a ligand that can be simultaneously applied as efficient light harvesting antenna for Tb surface ions and strong linker of biomolecules to the LnNPs surfaces. To demonstrate generic applicability of the photosensitized TbNP&#8208;bioconjugates, we applied them in two prototypical applications for biosensing and bioimaging. First, in&#8208;solution biorecognition was shown by time&#8208;resolved F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between streptavidin&#8208;functionalized TbNPs to biotinylated dyes (ATTO 610). Second, in&#8208;situ detection of ligand&#8208;receptor binding on cells was accomplished with TbNP&#8208;antibody (Matuzumab) conjugates that could specifically bind to transmembrane epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR). High specificity and sensitivity were demonstrated by time&#8208;gated imaging of EGFR on both strongly (A431) and weakly (HeLa and Cos7) EGFR&#8208;expressing cell lines, whereas non&#8208;expressing cell lines (NIH3T3) and EGFR&#8208;passivated A431 cells did not show any signals. Despite the relatively large size of TbNP&#8208;antibody conjugates, they could be internalized by A431 cells upon binding to extracellular EGFR, which showed their potential as bright and stable luminescence markers for intracellular signalling.</dc:description>

      <title>Reactions in Water Involving the &#8220;On&#8208;Water&#8221; Mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>
Like oil and water: Ever&#8208;evolving advances in water&#8208;compatible catalysts have enriched the current understanding of sustainable organic chemistry, nevertheless, the lack of a clearly defined classification system has led to confusion. In addition to the definition of words and proposed model of &#8220;on&#8208;water&#8221; mechanism, recent examples of reactions accelerated in water are herein discussed.







Abstract
Ever&#8208;evolving catalyst advances in synthetic protocols using water as a reaction medium have enriched the understanding of sustainable organic chemistry. Because conventional classification and definitions were ambivalent, it is proposed here that catalytic reactions using water be collectively called to be &#8220;in water&#8221;, with further classification into seven types. When accelerated in water as heterogeneous mixtures, the reactions can be regarded as following an &#8220;on&#8208;water&#8221; mechanism. The original term &#8220;on water&#8221; coined by Sharpless is incongruous with catalytic reactions, whereas on&#8208;water used in this review covers all the interfaces involving water where chemical reactions are accelerated. As a result of the unconcluded dispute on the antiquated catalyst&#8208;free &#8220;on water&#8221; model, the modified model defines three water layers: water molecules that are oriented to extrude protons toward the oil phase in the inner layer, those enwrapped by a secondary layer, and finally the bulk water layer. In light of the latitudinous outlook on the role of water at the interface, selected examples of reactions, in particular those reported over the past decade, that follow an &#8220;on&#8208;water&#8221; mechanism are reviewed herein.

      <title>The Macrocycle versus Chain Competition in On&#8208;Surface Polymerization: Insights from Reactions of 1,3&#8208;Dibromoazulene on Cu(111)</title>
      <dc:description>
The competition between macrocycle and chain formation in organometallic on&#8208;surface polymerization can be steered by variation of coverage and temperature. The entropically favored chains are preferentially formed under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions and high coverage, whereas the more stable macrocycles prevail when the on&#8208;surface synthesis is performed in equilibrium at low coverages.







Abstract
Ring/chain competition in oligomerization reactions represents a long&#8208;standing topic of synthetic chemistry and was treated extensively for solution reactions but is not well&#8208;understood for the two&#8208;dimensional confinement of surface reactions. Here, the kinetic and thermodynamic principles of ring/chain competition in on&#8208;surface synthesis are addressed by scanning tunneling microscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Monte Carlo simulations applied to azulene&#8208;based organometallic oligomers on Cu(111). Analysis of experiments and simulations reveals how the ring/chain ratio can be controlled through variation of coverage and temperature. At room temperature, non&#8208;equilibrium conditions prevail and kinetic control leads to preferential formation of the entropically favored chains. In contrast, high&#8208;temperature equilibrium conditions are associated with thermodynamic control, resulting in increased yields of the energetically favored rings. The optimum conditions for ring formation include the lowest possible temperature within the regime of thermodynamic control and a low coverage. The general implications are discussed and compared to the solution case.

      <dc:description>
The cover image illustrates a card game based on phosphorus and boron. The Joker card is the title compound 1&#8208;phospha&#8208;7&#8208;bora&#8208;norbornadiene. This card is wild and its behavior depends on the compound card it is played on. For nitriles, an insertion of the C&#8801;N triple bond into the P&#8722;B bond is observed, while alkynes undergo a facile 1,4&#8208;addition of the C&#8801;C triple bond with concomitant P&#8722;B bond cleavage. The divergent reactivity of the title compound resembles that of a frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP). More information can be found in the Full Paper by R.&#8197;M. Gschwind, C. M&#252;ller, J.&#8197;C.

      <dc:description>
Bidirectional syntheses of C2&#8208;symmetrical intermediates is an important concept for constructing stereochemical scaffolds of natural products. In particular, the synthesis of deoxygenated segments of polyketides poses a particular challenge to synthetic strategies. On this background, the mono&#8208;Zweifel Olefination of C2&#8208;symmetrical 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic esters) serves as the transformation in the desymmetrization step. This work shows the practicality of this concept on the synthesis of serricornin and (+)&#8208;invictolide. Giada Tedesco and Lucas Millbrodt are acknowledged for generating this artwork.

      <title>Flexible Metal Oxide Semiconductor Devices Made by Solution Methods</title>
      <dc:description>
Bend and flex: Solution&#8208;processed metal oxide semiconductors have shown great promise for next&#8208;generation flexible electronic devices. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, flexible, solution&#8208;processed metal oxide thin&#8208;film transistor semiconductors are reviewed with respect to fabrication processes, structures, circuits, systems, and application in energy&#8208;harvesting devices.







Abstract
For the fabrication of next&#8208;generation flexible metal oxide devices, solution&#8208;based methods are considered as a promising approach because of their potential advantages, such as high&#8208;throughput, large&#8208;area scalability, low&#8208;cost processing, and easy control over the chemical composition. However, to obtain certain levels of electrical performance, a high process temperature is essential, which can significantly limit its application in flexible electronics.

     alt="Flexible Metal Oxide Semiconductor Devices Made by Solution Methods"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bend and flex &lt;/b&gt;: Solution&#8208;processed metal oxide semiconductors have shown great promise for next&#8208;generation flexible electronic devices. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, flexible, solution&#8208;processed metal oxide thin&#8208;film transistor semiconductors are reviewed with respect to fabrication processes, structures, circuits, systems, and application in energy&#8208;harvesting devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the fabrication of next&#8208;generation flexible metal oxide devices, solution&#8208;based methods are considered as a promising approach because of their potential advantages, such as high&#8208;throughput, large&#8208;area scalability, low&#8208;cost processing, and easy control over the chemical composition. However, to obtain certain levels of electrical performance, a high process temperature is essential, which can significantly limit its application in flexible electronics. Therefore, this article discusses recent research conducted on developing low&#8208;temperature, solution&#8208;processed, flexible, metal oxide semiconductor devices, from a single thin&#8208;film transistor device to fully integrated circuits and systems. The main challenges of solution&#8208;processed metal oxide semiconductors are introduced. Recent advances in materials, processes, and semiconductor structures are then presented, followed by recent advances in electronic circuits and systems based on these semiconductors, including emerging flexible energy&#8208;harvesting devices for self&#8208;powered systems that integrate displays, sensors, data&#8208;storage units, and information processing functions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Coexistence of Spin&#8211;Lattice Relaxation and Phonon&#8208;Bottleneck Processes in GdIII&#8211;Phthlocyaninato Triple&#8208;Decker Complexes under Highly Diluted Conditions</title>
      <dc:description>
Diluting effects: Phthalocyaninato&#8211;GdIII complexes with no distinct magnetic anisotropy undergo slow magnetic relaxation processes similar to single&#8208;molecule magnets. Magnetic dilution by doping the GdIII complexes into diamagnetic YIII complexes induced dual magnetic relaxation processes caused by spin&#8211;lattice relaxations and phonon&#8208;bottleneck effects (see figure).







Abstract
Gd3+ complexes have been shown to undergo unusual slow magnetic relaxation processes similar to those of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs), even though Gd3+ does not exhibit strong magnetic anisotropy. To reveal the origin of the slow magnetic relaxation of Gd3+ complexes, we have investigated the magnetic properties and heat capacities of two Gd3+&#8208;phthalocyaninato triple&#8208;decker complexes, one of which has intramolecular Gd3+&#8211;Gd3+ interactions and the other does not. It was found that the Gd3+&#8211;Gd3+ interactions accelerate the magnetic relaxation processes. In addition, magnetically diluted samples, prepared by doping a small amount of the Gd3+ complexes into a large amount of diamagnetic Y3+ complexes, underwent dual magnetic relaxation processes. A detailed dynamic magnetic analysis revealed that the coexistence of spin&#8211;lattice relaxation and phonon&#8208;bottleneck processes is the origin of the dual magnetic relaxation processes.

      <title>Selective recovery of ammonia nitrogen from wastewaters with transition metal&#8208;loaded polymeric cation exchange adsorbents</title>
      <dc:description>Extracting valuable products from wastewaters with nitrogen&#8208;selective adsorbents can offset energy&#8208;intensive ammonia production, rebalance the nitrogen cycle, and incentivize environmental remediation. Separating nitrogen (N) as ammonium from other wastewater cations (e.g., K  +  , Ca  2+  ) presents a major challenge to N removal from wastewater and N recovery as high&#8208;purity products. We achieved high selectivity and capacity via ligand exchange of ammonia with ammine&#8208;complexing transition metals loaded onto polymeric cation exchange resins. Compared to commercial resins, metal&#8208;ligand exchange adsorbents exhibited higher ammonia removal capacity (8 meq/g) and selectivity (N/K  +  equilibrium selectivity of 10.1) in binary equimolar solutions. Considering optimal ammonia concentrations (200&#8208;300 meq/L) and pH (9&#8208;10) for metal&#8208;ligand exchange, we identified hydrolyzed urine as a promising candidate for selective TAN recovery. However, divalent cation exchange increased transition metal elution and reduced ammonia adsorption. Ultimately, metal&#8208;ligand exchange adsorbents can advance nitrogen&#8208;selective separations from wastewaters.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The silene molecule (H  2  SiCH  2  ; X  1  A  1  ) has been synthesized under single collision conditions via the bimolecular gas phase reaction of ground state methylidyne radicals (CH) with silane (SiH  4  ).

Both silylmethyl and methylsilyl intermediates undergo unimolecular hydrogen loss to silene (H  2  SiCH  2  ; X  1  A  1  ).

      <title>Ratiometric detection of ATP by fluorescent cyclophanes with bellows&#8208;type sensing mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>Pyrene&#8208;based cyclophanes have been synthesized with the aim to realize a bellows&#8208;type sensing mechanism for the ratiometric detection of nucleotide concentrations in a buffered aqueous solution. The sensing mechanism involves the encapsulation of a nucleobase between two pyrene rings, which affects the monomer&#8208;excimer equilibrium of the receptor in the excited state. The nature of the spacer and its connection pattern to pyrene rings have been varied to achieve high selectivity for ATP. The 1,8&#8208;substituted pyrene&#8208;based cyclophane with the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;diaminodiethylamine spacer demonstrates the best selectivity for ATP showing a 50&#8208;fold increase in the monomer&#8208;excimer emission ratio upon saturation with the nucleotide. The receptor can detect ATP within the biological concentrations range over a wide pH range. NMR and spectroscopic studies have revealed the importance of hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions for achieving a required receptor selectivity. The probe has been successfully applied for the real&#8208;time monitoring of creatine kinase activity.</dc:description>

      <title>Nanoisozymes: The Origin behind Pristine CeO2 as Enzyme&#8208;mimetics</title>
      <dc:description>It is well&#8208;known that the interplay between molecules and active sites on the topmost surface of solid catalyst determines its activity in heterogeneous catalysis. The electron density of active site is believed to affect both adsorption and activation of reactant molecules at surface. Unfortunately, commercial X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) often adopted for such characterization is not sensitive enough to catalyst&#8217; topmost surface. In our opinion, most researchers fail to acknowledge this point during their catalytic correlation, leading to different interpretations found in literatures over the past decades. Recent studies on pristine Cu2O (Nat. Catal. 2019, 2, 889; Nat. Energy 2019, 4, 957) have clearly suggested that the electron density of surface Cu is facet dependent and plays a key role in CO2 reduction. Herein, we show that pristine CeO2 can reach 2506%/1133% increase in phosphatase&#8208;/peroxidase&#8208;like activity once the exposed surface is wisely selected. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) with surface probe, the electron density of surface Ce (i.e. the active site) is found facet&#8208;dependent and the key factor dictating their enzyme mimicking activities. Most importantly, the surface area of those CeO2 morphologies was demonstrated to become a factor only when their surface Ce can activate the adsorbed reactant molecules.</dc:description>

      <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Mesoporous Carbon Materials Derived from Fullerene Microsheets for Energy Applications</title>
      <dc:description>Porous carbon materials with rich defects are promising candidates in energy storage and conversion applications. Herein, we report a facile template&#8208;free approach for the synthesis of a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) mesoporous carbon material derived from fullerene (C60) microsheets (FMSs) by simple heat&#8208;treatment. The sample obtained at 1000  o  C (FMS1000) shows a large surface area of 1507.6 m  2  g  &#8208;1  due to the presence of mesopores and rich defects which promote the electron and mass transfer in the electrocatalysis process of oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) showing excellent performances with an onset potential of 0.95 V, half&#8208;wave potential of 0.85 V and long&#8208;term durability of 2000 cycles which are comparable to that of commercial Pt/C. Moreover, FMS1000 displays a remarkable supercapacitive property with specific capacitance of 330.7 F g  &#8208;1  at 0.2 A g  &#8208;1  and long&#8208;term stability with capacitance retention of 97% over 50,000 cycles. Thus, a practical strategy for the production of mesoporous carbon materials with different morphological structures and porous defects as high&#8208;performance energy materials is advanced.</dc:description>

      <title>The Earlier the Better: Structural Analysis and Separation of Lanthanides with Pyrroloquinoline Quinone</title>
      <dc:description>Lanthanides (Ln) are critical raw materials, however, their mining and purification have a considerable negative environmental impact and sustainable recycling and separation strategies for these elements are needed. In this study, we present the precipitation and solubility behavior of Ln complexes with Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), the cofactor of recently discovered lanthanide (Ln) dependent methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) enzymes. In this context, we have been able to elucidate the molecular structure of a bio&#8208;relevant europium PQQ complex for the first time outside a protein environment. The complex crystallizes as an inversion symmetric dimer, Eu  2  PQQ  2  , with binding of Eu in the biologically relevant pocket of PQQ. LnPQQ and Ln1Ln2PQQ complexes are characterized using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS), Infrared (IR) spectroscopy,  151  Eu&#8208;M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray total scattering, and Extended X&#8208;ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS). We show that a natural enzymatic cofactor is capable to achieve separation by precipitation of the notoriously similar, and thus difficult to separate, lanthanides to some extent.</dc:description>

      <title>Control over the Redox Cooperative Mechanism of Radical Carbene Transfer Reactions for the Efficient Active&#8208;Metal&#8208;Template Synthesis of [2]Rotaxanes</title>
      <dc:description>
Radical carbene transfer reactions promoted by macrocyclic CoII&#8211;porphyrinates bearing nitrogen&#8208;based axial ligands were used to assemble asymmetrical [2]rotaxanes through the active&#8208;metal&#8208;template technique. Careful control of the reaction conditions and proper choice of axial ligands enable formation of rotaxanes in up to 95% yield, while precluding formation of non&#8208;interlocked byproducts and total suppression of radical proton abstraction and carbene dimerization side reactions. The present study provides a detailed investigation on how to control the redox cooperative mechanism between the CoII ion in the porphyrin core and the radical carbene species to favor rotaxane formation. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;D. Megiatto et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.201905602).

      <title>Thermal adaptation of enzymes: impacts of conformational shifts on catalytic activation energy and optimum temperature</title>
      <dc:description>Thermal adaptation of enzymes is essential for both living organism development in extreme conditions and efficient biocatalytic applications.

In contrast with pictures focusing on protein flexibility and dynamics, we reveal the key role played by temperature&#8208;induced shifts in protein conformational distributions; we show that while the homologs' reaction free energies are similar, the striking discrepancy between their activation energies is caused by their different conformational changes with temperature.

      <title>Desymmetrization of C2&#8208;Symmetric Bis(Boronic Esters) by Zweifel Olefinations</title>
      <dc:description>
It's a crab! By combining the Hoppe, Matteson, Aggarwal, and Zweifel chemistry, a bidirectional access to polyketides featuring the challenging 1,3&#8208;deoxypropionate motif is presented. The desymmetrization of various 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic esters) led to synthetically interesting building blocks. With this reliable method the pheromones invictolide and serricornin were synthesized.







Abstract
anti&#8208;Configured 1,3&#8208;dimethyl deoxypropionate motifs are important sub structures in natural products. Herein, we describe a bidirectional approach for the rapid construction of natural products featuring such motifs by using C2&#8208;symmetrical 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic esters). As for its application in convergent syntheses it was important to establish a selective mono&#8208;Zweifel olefination we describe the scope and limitations by using different 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic esters) and nucleophiles. This protocol takes advantage of the combination of the Hoppe&#8211;Matteson&#8211;Zweifel chemistry, which was elegantly put into practice by Aggarwal et&#8197;al. In order to show its applicability the total syntheses of two natural products, serricornin and (+)&#8208;invictolide, were performed.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It's a crab &lt;/b&gt;! By combining the Hoppe, Matteson, Aggarwal, and Zweifel chemistry, a bidirectional access to polyketides featuring the challenging 1,3&#8208;deoxypropionate motif is presented. The desymmetrization of various 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic esters) led to synthetically interesting building blocks. With this reliable method the pheromones invictolide and serricornin were synthesized.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;anti &lt;/i&gt;&#8208;Configured 1,3&#8208;dimethyl deoxypropionate motifs are important sub structures in natural products. Herein, we describe a bidirectional approach for the rapid construction of natural products featuring such motifs by using &lt;i&gt;C &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;symmetrical 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic esters). As for its application in convergent syntheses it was important to establish a selective mono&#8208;Zweifel olefination we describe the scope and limitations by using different 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic esters) and nucleophiles. This protocol takes advantage of the combination of the Hoppe&#8211;Matteson&#8211;Zweifel chemistry, which was elegantly put into practice by Aggarwal et&#8197;al. In order to show its applicability the total syntheses of two natural products, serricornin and (+)&#8208;invictolide, were performed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Boronate Ester&#8208;Capped Helicates</title>
      <dc:description>
Helicates with caps: Metal&#8208;templated multicomponent reactions of bispyridyloxime ligands with arylboronic acids give helicates with terminal arylboronate ester groups. The latter can be used to introduce functional groups such as pyridines, aldehydes, nitriles, and carboxylic acids in an apical position (see figure).







Abstract
Triple&#8208;stranded helicates were obtained by metal&#8208;templated multicomponent reactions of bispyridyloxime ligands with arylboronic acids. The helicates feature two hexa&#8208;coordinated MII ions (M=Fe, Zn, or Mn), which are embedded in a macrobicyclic ligand framework, and two arylboronate ester capping groups. The latter can be used to introduce functional groups such as pyridines, aldehydes, nitriles, and carboxylic acids in apical position. The functionalized helicates have the potential to be used as nanoscale building blocks for more complex assemblies, as evidenced by the synthesis of a 3&#8197;nm&#8208;sized trianglimine.

      <title>Control over the Redox Cooperative Mechanism of Radical Carbene Transfer Reactions for the Efficient Active&#8208;Metal&#8208;Template Synthesis of [2]Rotaxanes</title>
      <dc:description>
Controlling radical behavior: Manipulation of the redox cooperative properties of carbenoid species and CoII ions results in a powerful methodology for the synthesis of [2]rotaxanes through the active&#8208;metal&#8208;template technique.







Abstract
A 5,15&#8208;bis(1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl)porphyrin&#8208;based molecular clip covalently connected to a ditopic aliphatic ester loop moiety yields a semi&#8208;rigid macrocycle with a well&#8208;defined cavity. The resulting macrocycle fits the structural requirements for the preparation of porphyrinates capable of promoting formation of C&#8722;C bonds. To demonstrate the usefulness of porphyrin&#8208;based macrocycles, an active&#8208;metal&#8208;template synthesis of rotaxanes through a redox non&#8208;innocent carbene transfer reaction is described. Coordination of CoII ions into the porphyrin subunit followed by addition of appropriate monodentate nitrogen&#8208;based additives to function as axial ligands enables the radical carbene transfer reactions to styrene derivatives to occur exclusively through the cavity of the macrocycle to afford cyclopropane&#8208;linked rotaxanes in excellent 95&#8201;% yield. Investigation of the product distribution afforded from the rotaxane assembly reaction reveals how the redox cooperative action between the carbene species and the CoII ions can be manipulated to gain control over the radical&#8208;type mechanism to favor the productive rotaxane forming process.
