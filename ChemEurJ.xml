         <title>Stereoselective Intramolecular [2 + 2] Trapping of 1,2&#8208;Cyclohexadienes: a&#160;Route to Rigid, Angularly Fused Tricyclic Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,2&#8208;Cyclohexadienes generated under mild fluoride&#8208;mediated desilylative conditions undergo efficient intramolecular [2 + 2] trapping, providing tricyclic alkylidene cyclobutanes with complete diastereoselectivity for the cis&#8208;fused products. Pendent styrenes or electron&#8208;deficient olefins can trap simple 1,2&#8208;cyclohexadienes or their oxygenated counterparts, with 14 substrates being disclosed. Reactions proceed at ambient temperature using just cesium fluoride in up to 91% yield, and the necessary precursors are easily accessed from substituted 2&#8208;bromocyclohexenones. Multiple synthetic routes have been developed to install the appropriate functional groups required for [2 + 2] trapping.</dc:description>

         <title>Foldamer Nanotubes Mediated Label&#8208;Free Detection of Protein&#8208;Small Molecule Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Label free detection of protein&#8208;small molecule interactions mediated by the helical peptide nanotubes using impedance spectroscopy is reported. This method can be used to detect interactions of protein and small molecules at very low concentrations.







Abstract
Development of miniaturized lab&#8208;on&#8208;chip devices for the detection of rapid and specific small molecule&#8208;protein binding interactions at very low concentrations holds significant importance in drug discovery and biomedical applications. Here, the label&#8208;free detection of small molecule&#8208;protein interactions is reported on the surface functionalizable nanotubes of &#945;,&#947;&#8208;hybrid peptide helical foldamers using nanoscale capacitance and impedance spectroscopy. The 12&#8208;helix conformation of the &#945;,&#947;&#8208;hybrid peptide observed in the single crystals, self&#8208;assembled into nanotubes in an aqueous environment with exposed cysteine thiols for small molecule conjugation. The binding of streptavidin to the covalently linked biotin on the surface of nanotubes was detected at the picomolar concentrations. No change in the capacitance and impedance were observed in the absence of either immobilized biotin or protein streptavidin. The functionalizable hybrid peptide nanotubes reported here pave the way for the label&#8208;free detection of various small molecule protein interactions at very low concentrations.

         <title>Photoinduced Minisci Reaction with Diazines: An Approach Toward Original Fused Heterocycles.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoinduced Minisci reaction on diazines, starting from carboxylic acid is reported using 4CzIPN (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) as the photoinitiator. The reaction proceeds in good to excellent yields (28 examples, 44&#8201;% to 89&#8201;%) under white LEDs irradiation with a slight excess of the acid reagent (1.2&#8197;equiv.) and the extension to continuous flow was demonstrated. Further cyclization reactions were developed to build up unprecedented N&#8208;heterocycles building blocks. A plausible radical chain mechanism was suggested.







Abstract
Herein, we developed a photoinduced Minisci reaction on a large panel of diazines with good to excellent yields (28 examples, 44&#8201;% to 89&#8201;%). The reaction using 4CzIPN (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) as photoinitiator was carried out under white LED irradiation and required a slight excess of the acid reagent (1.2&#8197;equiv.). Cyclization reactions were then developed to access original N&#8208;heterocycles building blocks for drug discovery programs. An extension of the reaction to continuous flow was also reported. Finally, the mechanism of the transformation was studied suggesting a plausible radical chain mechanism.

         <dc:description>
The discovery of new catalytic applications for metals remains an important goal in organic synthesis. Herein, the Cu&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of imidazolidine through heterocyclic recombination between aziridine and diazetidine is presented. The scope is sufficiently broad to form various imidazolidines, since the reaction conditions are suitable for many functional groups.Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Heterocyclic Recombination of Aziridine and Diazetidine for the Synthesis of Imidazolidine (Murakami et al.)







Abstract
The discovery of new catalytic applications for metals remains an important goal in organic synthesis. If a catalyst has multiple functions, such as inducing bond cleavage and formation, it can streamline multi&#8208;step transformations. Herein, the Cu&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of imidazolidine through heterocyclic recombination between aziridine and diazetidine is reported. Mechanistically, Cu catalyzes the conversion of diazetidine into the corresponding imine, which then reacts with aziridine to form imidazolidine. The scope is sufficiently wide to form various imidazolidines, as many functional groups are compatible with the reaction conditions.

         <title>Stepwise Stimuli&#8208;Responsive, Multicolor&#8208;Chromic Perylene Bisimide/Polyvinyl Alcohol Co&#8208;assembly System for Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular strategy based on a co&#8208;assembly system of perylene bisimides/polyvinyl alcohol for the application of multidimensional information encryption has been developed. The multidimensional chromic response is achieved through an evolution process including photoinduced electron transfer to PBI, packing rearrangement and oxidation of PBI radical anions/dianions.







Abstract
The issue of information security has become a concern in all aspects of daily life, prompting the development of encryption technologies. Therein, optical encryption using color/graphical patterns holds great potential. However, current approaches generally rely on monochromic change upon one or more stimuli, limiting their further application in advanced confidential encryption. Herein, we propose a delicate strategy based on a co&#8208;assembly system of perylene bisimides (PBI)/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) that demonstrates stepwise stimuli response and multicolor changes. The color of the supramolecular system changes from red to purple under the stimulus of UV light, and to orange when exposed to water. The multidimensional chromic response is achieved by an evolution process including the generation, packing rearrangement and quenching of PBI radical anions/dianions. With the virtues of photo&#8208; and hydrochromism, this novel co&#8208;assembly system was successfully employed for advanced anticounterfeiting and versatile information encryption applications.

         <title>Inversion of Diaza[5]Helicenes Through an N&#8722;N Bond Breaking Pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diaza[5]helicenes with N&#8722;N linkages were found to racemize through the N&#8722;N bond&#8208;breaking pathway by kinetic experiments and DFT calculations. Modification of S to SO2 at the outer position of the helix reduced the electronic repulsion in the N&#8722;N bond, resulting in a significant increase in the inversion barrier.







Abstract
1,1&#8217;,10,10&#8217;&#8208;Biphenothiazine and its S,S,S&#8217;,S&#8217;&#8208;tetroxide are diaza[5]helicenes with N&#8722;N linkages. Kinetic experiments on racemization together with DFT calculations revealed that they undergo inversion through the N&#8722;N bond breaking pathway rather than the general conformational pathway. In these diaza[5]helicenes with this inversion mechanism, the reduction of electronic repulsion in the N&#8722;N bond by modification of S to SO2 at the outer position of the helix led to a significantly higher inversion barrier, 35.3&#8197;kcal/mol, compared to [5]helicene. 1,1&#8217;,10,10&#8217;&#8208;Biphenothiazine S,S,S&#8217;,S&#8217;&#8208;tetroxide was highly resistant to acid&#8208;mediated N&#8722;N bond breaking and racemization under acidic conditions.

         <title>Stable Spiro&#8208;Fused Diarylaminyl Radicals: A New Type of a Neutral Mixed&#8208;Valence System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of stable spiro&#8208;fused diarylaminyl radicals that are radical cations with the &#8220;canceled charge&#8221; was obtained. The radicals belong to Class&#8197;II Robin&#8208;Day neutral mixed&#8208;valence systems that are rare. They are valuable models to mimic natural electron transfer reactions promoting a deeper understanding of their mechanism. The advanced properties of the radicals make them of potential interest in materials science.







Abstract
A new type of neutral mixed&#8208;valence system was synthesized using a facile one&#8208;pot procedure. The spiro&#8208;conjugated framework is additionally &#8220;fastened&#8221; with a biphenyl bridge, which does not directly participate in spin delocalization but makes the molecule stable and influences the reorganization energy and the energy barrier of the intramolecular electron transfer. The in&#8208;depth experimental and quantum&#8208;chemical study allowed determining the radicals as the Class&#8197;II Robin&#8208;Day&#8208;mixed&#8208;valence systems. The structure of the radicals was confirmed by the X&#8208;ray data, which are relatively rare for Class&#8197;II MV molecules. Advanced properties of the radicals, such as an ambipolar redox behavior and panchromatic absorption in the visible and NIR regions, along with their stability, make them of interest for materials science. All radicals demonstrate the SOMO&#8208;HOMO inversion phenomenon, which was supported by the DFT and the experimental study.

         <title>Long&#8208;Lived Charge Separated States in Anthraquinone&#8208;Phenothiazine Dyads: Synthesis and Study of the Photophysical Property by Using Transient Optical and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;lived charge separated state was observed in phenothiazine&#8208;anthraquinone dyads containing adamantane linker. The photophysical processes were studied with steady state and femtosecond/nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopic method. The electron exchange of the radical ion pairs was quantified with time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectra.







Abstract
In order to obtain long&#8208;lived charge separated (CS) states in electron donor&#8208;acceptor dyads, herein we prepared a series of anthraquinone (AQ)&#8208;phenothiazine (PTZ) dyads, with adamantane as the linker. UV&#8211;vis absorption spectra show negligible electronic interaction between the AQ and PTZ units at ground state, yet charge transfer (CT) emission bands were observed. Nanosecond transient absorption shows that the 3AQ state is populated upon photoexcitation for AQ&#8208;PTZ in cyclohexane (CHX), but in acetonitrile (ACN) a 3CS state is formed. Similar results were observed for AQ&#8208;PTZ&#8208;M. The 3CS state lifetimes were determined as 0.52&#8197;&#956;s and 0.49&#8197;&#956;s, respectively. Upon oxidation of the PTZ unit, the 3AQ state was observed in both polar and non&#8208;polar solvents. For AQ&#8208;PTZ, femtosecond transient absorption spectra show fast formation of the 3AQ state in all solvents, with no charge separation in CHX, while formation of the 3CS state takes 106&#8197;ps in ACN. For AQ&#8208;PTZ&#8208;M, a 3CS state is formed in CHX within 241&#8197;ps. Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra show that a radical ion pair with electron exchange energy of |2&#8197;J|&#8805;5.68&#8197;mT was observed for AQ&#8208;PTZ and AQ&#8208;PTZ&#8208;M, whereas in the dyads with the PTZ unit oxidized, only the 3AQ state was observed.

         <title>Molecular Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyads for Single&#8208;Material Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of ambipolar molecular donor&#8208;acceptor dyads D5&#8208;D10 was synthesized and characterized allowing for the elaboration of valuable structure&#8208;property relationships, which were correlated to the photovoltaic performance in single&#8208;material organic solar cells, in which power conversion efficiencies of up to 4.3&#8201;% were reached.







Abstract
A series of ambipolar covalently linked oligothiophene&#8208;fullerene dyads have been synthesized by systematical structural variations. In this respect, the length of linker between donor and acceptor unit was altered and in a second series the terminal acceptor units in the donor unit of the dyads were varied. Characterization of the optical and redox properties gave valuable structure&#8208;property relationships and were correlated to the photovoltaic performance in single&#8208;material organic solar cells, in which power conversion efficiencies of up to 4.3&#8201;% were reached.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Drug Release from Nanometric Micelles in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micelles constructed with sydnonimines are cleaved upon addition of cyclooctynes in a bioorthogonal manner, leading to the massive release of an anticancer drug in living cells. Fast release of the drug triggered a stronger antiproliferative activity on tumor cells compared to the passive diffusion from the micelles core.







Abstract
We explored a bioorthogonal approach to release drugs from stimuli&#8208;responsive micelles inside tumor cells. The concept relies on sydnonimine&#8208;based micelles that undergo quantitative cleavage in presence of cyclooctynes, hence releasing their content within living cells. Four cleavable micelles were developed to allow massive burst release of Entinostat, a potent histone deacetylase inhibitor, following their internalization inside cancer cells. A comparative study on the influence of the bioorthogonal&#8208;mediated versus passive drug release from micelles was carried out. The results indicated that a fast release of the drug triggered a stronger antiproliferative activity on tumor cells compared to the passive diffusion of the drug from the micelles core. These finding may be of great interest for the development of new nanomedicines.

         <title>3&#8208;Ligated Phenothiazinyl&#8208;terephthalonitrile Dyads and Triads &#8208; Synthesis, Electronic Properties, Delayed Fluorescence and Electronic Structure</title>

Prompt and delayed emission: A series of 3&#8208;ligated or bridged phenothiazinyl&#8208;terephthalonitrile dyads and triads are accessed in a one&#8208;pot fashion and photophysical studies in solution, solid&#8208;state and in polymer matrix reveal TADF (thermally activated delayed fluorescence) as estimated experimentally for four dyes and confirmed by DFT/MRCI calculations for one dyad.







Abstract
The bromine&#8208;lithium exchange&#8208;borylation&#8208;Suzuki sequence efficiently furnishes phenothiazine&#8208;terephthalonitrile donor&#8208;acceptor dyads and triads in high yields. In contrast to most phenothiazine&#8208;acceptor conjugates the title compounds are ligated in p&#8208;position to the phenothiazine nitrogen atom. Moreover, the acceptors are either directly linked or ligated by an arylene bridge and p&#8208;anisyl N&#8208;substituents on the phenothiazine are chosen to lock the tricycle into an intra&#8208;configuration. Cyclic voltammetry reveals effects of bridging and ligation of the N&#8208;substituent. Optical spectroscopy likewise displays similar band gaps, large Stokes shifts and substantial to high quantum yields in solution, in the solid state and in PMMA matrix. Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence spectroscopy indicates quite long fluorescence decay times in solution and emission components in the microsecond time range. TADF properties are further assessed by fluorescence increase in deoxygenated solution, gated emission spectroscopy and temperature&#8208;dependent determination of phosphorescence. The nature of the electronically excited states is investigated by DFT/MRCI. While for the directly ligated dyad a singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap 
of 0.24&#8197;eV can be estimated and is consistently confirmed by quantum chemical calculations on the lowest energy conformer, even lower 
of 0.029 and 0.008&#8197;eV are estimated for the investigated dyads and the triad in the solid state and in PMMA matrix.

         <title>Manganese(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Transfer Hydrogenation of the C=C Bond in Conjugated Ketones at Room Temperature</title>

Chemoselective C=C bond transfer hydrogenation in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones is described using a cost&#8208;effective pincer&#8208;ligated manganese catalyst at room temperature.







Abstract
Chemoselective transfer hydrogenation of C=C bond in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones is demonstrated at room temperature employing a manganese(I) catalyst and half an equivalent of ammonia&#8208;borane (H3N&#8722;BH3). A series of mixed&#8208;donor pincer&#8208;ligated Mn(II) complexes, (tBu2PN3NPyz)MnX2 [&#954;P,&#954;N,&#954;N&#8208;(N&#8208;(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphaneyl)&#8208;6&#8208;(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;amine)MnX2] {X=Cl (Mn2), X=Br (Mn3), X=I (Mn4)} were synthesized and characterized. Amongst the Mn(II) complexes, (Mn2, Mn3, Mn4) and Mn(I) complex, (tBu2PN3NPyz)Mn(CO)2Br (Mn1) screened; the Mn1 acts as an efficient catalyst for the chemoselective C=C bond reduction in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. Various synthetically important functionalities like halides, methoxy, trifluoromethyl, benzyloxy, nitro, amine, and unconjugated alkene and alkyne groups, including heteroarenes, were compatible and provided saturated ketones in excellent yields (up to 97&#8201;%). A preliminary mechanistic study highlighted the crucial role of metal&#8211;ligand (M&#8211;L) cooperation through the dearomatization&#8208;aromatization process in catalyst Mn1 for the chemoselective C=C bond transfer hydrogenation.

         <title>Mechanism of Acyl Group Migration in Carbohydrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acyl groups are prone to migrate in carbohydrates, causing issues in the laboratory setting. Migration could also have biological relevance, such as in regulation of cell signaling. Recently, deeper investigations have been performed on the mechanism of this phenomenon. In this concept article some of the investigations are discussed, providing insights into the mechanism and the migration process in general.







Abstract
Acyl group migration has been the subject of several studies. Such migration processes may cause problems during synthesis, isolation, and purification of different acyl&#8208;bearing compounds, and have biological relevance, for example, in the metabolism of pharmaceuticals. Considering the recent evidence of acyl group migration being possible even over glycosidic bonds, it could be hypothesized to be involved also in the regulation of biological activity of natural polysaccharides in the host cells. Migrations are mostly observed in carbohydrates, typically having several hydroxyl groups near each other. Several studies have investigated the migration in a single or only a few different carbohydrate molecules, providing different suggestions for the mechanisms of migration, seldom supported by comprehensive computational investigations. In this concept article we discuss the recent progress on the mechanistic aspects of acyl group migration, with carbohydrates in particular focus.

         <title>Synthesis and Conformational Analysis of Fullerene Torsion Balances for Assessing the Contribution of Dispersion and Anionic Character in Non&#8208;Covalent Arene&#8211;Fullerene Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of fullerene&#8208;derived molecular torsion balances have been synthesized to quantitatively evaluate the contribution of the dispersion force to the arene&#8212;fullerene interaction. The torsion balance with a mercaptophenyl group was converted to the corresponding thiophenolate anion by adding an amine. Consequently, the anionic arene&#8212;fullerene interactions were elucidated. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Yamada and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300877).

         <title>Borylated Subphthalocyanines: Versatile Precursors for the Preparation of Functional Bowl&#8208;Shaped Aromatics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The peripheral borylation of porphyrinoids has become a key step to prepare advanced functional materials. Herein we report the synthesis, electronic properties, and reactivity of borylated Subphthalocyanines. These compounds, which are prepared by Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura borylation in excellent yields, are easily purified, display a great stability, and serve as powerful starting materials for the post&#8208;functionalization of SubPcs via cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Remarkably, this novel approach is more efficient than the methodologies already described and enables the preparation of exotic systems, such as SubPc dimeric species linked by C&#8208;C bonds, which are not accessible so far and present promising properties for optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Urea Type Linker For Functionalisation of Natural Glycans and its Validation in Glycan Arrays</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The isolation from organisms and readily available glycoproteins has become an increasingly convenient source of N&#8208;glycans for multiple applications including glycan microarrays, as reference standards in glycan analysis or as reagents that improve bioavailability of protein and peptide therapeutics through conjugation. A problematic step in the isolation process on a preparative scale can be the attachment of a linker for the improved purification, separation, immobilization and quantification of the glycan structures. Addressing this issue, we firstly aimed for the development of an UV active linker for a fast and reliable attachment to anomeric glycosylamines via urea bond formation. Secondly, we validated the new linker on glycan arrays in a comparative study with a collection of N&#8208;glycans which were screened against various lectins. In total, we coupled four structurally varied N&#8208;glycans to four different linkers, immobilized all constructs on a microarray and compared their binding affinities to four plant and fungal lectins of widely described specificity. Our study shows that the urea type linker showed an overall superior performance for lectin binding and once more, highlights the often neglected influence of the choice of linker on lectin recognition.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Crystalline Intermediates in Mechanochemical Cyclorhodation Reactions Elucidated by in situ X&#8208;ray Powder Diffraction and Computations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The occurrence of crystalline intermediates in mechanochemical reactions may be more widespread than previously assumed. For example, a recent study involving the acetate&#8208;assisted C&#8211;H activation of N&#8208;heterocycles with [Cp*RhCl2]2 by ball milling revealed the formation of transient cocrystals between the reagents prior to the C&#8211;H activation step. However, such crystalline intermediates were only observed through stepwise intervallic ex situ analysis and their exact role in the C&#8211;H activation process remained unclear. In the present study, we monitored the formation of discrete, stoichiometric cocrystals between benzo[h]quinoline and [Cp*RhCl2]2 by ball milling using in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray powder diffraction. This continuous analysis revealed an initial cocrystal that transformed into a second crystalline form. Computational studies showed that differences in non&#8208;covalent interactions made the [Cp*RhCl2]2 unit in the later&#8208;appearing cocrystal more reactive towards reaction with NaOAc. This demonstrated the advantage of cocrystal formation before the acetate&#8208;assisted metalation&#8208;deprotonation step and evidence how the net cooperative action of weak interactions between the reagents in mechanochemical experiments can lead to stable supramolecular assemblies, which can enhance substrate activation under ball milling conditions. This could explain the superiority of some mechanochemical reactions, such as acetate&#8208;assisted C&#8211;H activation, compared to their solution&#8208;based counterparts.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Organocatalysis and Superacid Activation: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 35, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
If chiral phosphoric acid catalysts are very efficient for the selective activation of basic substrates, such as imines or carbonyl compounds, the functionalization of non&#8208;polarized C=C bonds, such as olefins or arenes, remained a stimulating goal for many years. This Concept article presents different smart strategies that have appeared throughout the years for the efficient functionalization of these challenging substrates.







Abstract
Since the pioneer reports of the groups of Akiyama and Terada on Br&#248;nsted acid organocatalysis, this field never stopped growing with the development of ingenious strategies for the activation of challenging poorly reactive substrates. The development of superacidic organocatalysts is an important way to selectively functionalize reluctant electrophiles and other approaches have also emerged such as the combination of Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acids as well as the consecutive organocatalysis and superacid activation. This Concept aims to highlight these different strategies and demonstrate their complementarity.

         <title>The Impact of the Solvent Dielectric Constant on A&#8592;NH3 Dative Bond Depends on the Nature of the Lewis Electron&#8208;Pair Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 35, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Influence of the solvent can be rather opposite depending on the dative bond complex under consideration. This is demonstrated using two different systems, namely H3B&#8592;NH3 and {Zn&#8592;(NH3)}2+ in selected solvents.







Abstract
The present work aims to determine to what extent the value of the dielectric constant of the solvent can influence the dative bond in Lewis electron pair bonding systems. For this purpose, two different systems, namely H3B&#8592;NH3 and {Zn&#8592;(NH3)}2+, were studied in selected solvents with significantly different dielectric constants. Based on the results from state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computational methods using DFT, constrained DFT, energy decomposition analyses, solvent accessible surface area, and charge transfer calculations, we found that the stability of the neutral H3B&#8592;NH3 system increases with increasing solvent polarity. In contrast, the opposite trend is observed for the positively charged {Zn&#8592;(NH3)}2+. The observed changes are attributed to different charge redistributions in neutral and charged complexes, which are reflected by a different response to the solvent and are quantified by changes in solvation energies.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Influence of the solvent&lt;/b&gt; can be rather opposite depending on the dative bond complex under consideration. This is demonstrated using two different systems, namely H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B&#8592;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and {Zn&#8592;(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in selected solvents.

         <title>Heterogeneous Photocatalytic Hydrogenative Reactions Using Liquid Hydrogen Donors: Mechanisms, Catalysts Design, and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 35, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept summarizes recent development in heterogeneous photocatalysis for hydrogenative reactions from the perspective of hydrogen donors. The basic criteria of hydrogen abstraction from organic molecule and water, donation to the target acceptor, and the design strategy of the photocatalyst materials are discussed.







Abstract
Heterogeneous photocatalysis is a promising approach for a wide range of hydrogenative reactions owing to the mild reaction conditions and the possibility of employing liquid hydrogen donors. Currently, the major interest is focused on the development of high performance photocatalyst materials and the expansion of reaction scope. An overview from a perspective of hydrogen donor and thus the related mechanistic understanding of the light&#8208;induced hydrogenative reactions is rare. Here, we have categorized the photocatalytic hydrogenative reactions by the type of employed liquid hydrogen donors (hydrocarbons and water), discussed the basic criteria of hydrogen abstraction from these donors, and elaborated the design strategy of the photocatalyst materials.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Observation for Dynamic Oscillation during Self&#8208;Assembly and Clearance of A&#946;42</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 35, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By performing a real&#8208;time observation and molecular dynamics investigation, we identified a non&#8208;equilibrium interaction occurring in the self&#8208;assembled pathway of A&#946;42 that dominated neuronal survival during interplay with an oscillator. A specific bait could further lengthen the lifetime of dynamic oscillation for heteromolecular binding by slowing down the self&#8208;propagation of A&#946;42, enhancing the efficiency of A&#946;42 clearance by neuronal cells.







Abstract
The dynamic oscillation implicated in structural heterogeneity during the self&#8208;assembly of amyloid peptide 1&#8211;42 (A&#946;42) may play a crucial role in eliciting cellular responses. We developed a real&#8208;time monitoring platform to observe an oscillatory non&#8208;equilibrium interaction that dominated the A&#946;42 clearance by neuronal cells during interplay with an oscillator (lipopolysaccharide, LPS). Molecular dynamics studies indicated that the electrostatic and hydrophobic segments of LPS involved in the temporary heteromolecular association and slightly decelerated the intrinsic thermally&#8211;induced protein dynamics of A&#946;42. A bait&#8208;specific intervention strategy could temporarily slow down the self&#8208;propagation of A&#946;42 to extend the lifetime of autonomous oscillation and augment A&#946;42 clearance of neuronal cells. The lifetime increment of oscillation shows a bait concentration&#8208;dependent manner to reflect the non&#8208;equilibrium binding strength. This relationship may serve as a predictor for Alzheimer's disease drug discovery.

         <title>To Isomerize or not to Isomerize? E/Z Isomers of Cyclic Azobenzene Derivatives and Their Reactivity Upon One&#8208;Electron Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 35, June 22, 2023. </description>

One&#8208;electron reduction of azo compounds generally results in isomerization forming the thermodynamically most stable radical anion. It is shown that the size of the central ring in 1,2&#8208;diazocines and diazonines has a ruling influence on the configuration of the one&#8208;electron reduced species.







Abstract
Azo compounds are efficient electron acceptors. Upon one&#8208;electron reduction they generally isomerize forming the thermodynamically most stable radical anion. Herein we show that the size of the central ring in 1,2&#8208;diazocines and diazonines has a ruling influence on the configuration of the one&#8208;electron reduced species. Markedly, diazonines, which bear a central nine membered heterocycle, show light&#8208;induced E/Z isomerization, but retain the configuration of the diazene N=N moiety upon one&#8208;electron reduction. Accordingly, E/Z isomerization is not induced by reduction.

         <title>Precisely Designed Difunctionalized Cyclodextrin Produces a Solid&#8208;State Organic Porous Hierarchical Supramolecular Assembly</title>

Hierarchical assembly: A porous hierarchical crystalline network was built using the macrocyclic&#8208;based supramolecular polymerization strategy. The precise di&#8208;functionalization of the &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin using hydrophobic functions encoded for three different hierarchical levels: a first supramolecular polymer, a second hexameric column and a third trihexagonal packing which ultimately give rise to channel&#8208;like pores.







Abstract
Regioselective di&#8208;functionalization of a cyclodextrin allows hydrophobic domains to be directed in a geometrically controlled manner. This controlled orientation ultimately gives access to an original hierarchical assembly in the solid state. This assembly spans over three levels of hierarchy which are governed by synergistic host&#8208;guest inclusions, directed hydrophobic effect and hydrogen bonding. This combination of interactions precisely positioned in space through regioselective functionalization of a cyclodextrin creates a porous organic architecture.

         <title>Boronic Acid Assisted Self&#8208;Assembly of Functional RNAs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 35, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boronate ester linkages can be formed in&#8197;situ by the reaction of an oligonucleotide bearing a 5&#8242;&#8208;boronic acid moiety with the 3&#8242;&#8208;terminal cis&#8208;diol of another oligonucleotide in a template&#8208;directed manner. Boronate ester bonds replacing the natural phosphodiesters in oligonucleotides have been shown to stabilize split hairpin ribozyme variants and a split version of the Mango aptamer, and restore activity.







Abstract
Boronate esters formed by reaction of an oligonucleotide carrying a 5&#8242;&#8208;boronic acid moiety with the 3&#8242;&#8208;terminal cis&#8208;diol of another have been shown previously to assist assembly of fragmented DNAzymes. Here we demonstrate that boronate esters replacing the natural phosphodiester linkage at selected sites of two functional RNAs, the hairpin ribozyme and the Mango aptamer, allow assembly of functional structures. The hairpin ribozyme, a small naturally occurring RNA that supports the reversible cleavage of appropriate RNA substrates, is very sensitive to fragmentation. Splitting the ribozyme at four different sites led to a significant decrease or even loss of cleavage and ligation activity. Ribozymes assembled from fragments capable of boronate ester formation showed restoration of cleavage activity in some but not all cases, dependent on the split site. Ligation proved to be more challenging, no supportive effect of the boronate ester was observed. Split variants of the Mango aptamer also showed a dramatic loss of functionality, which however, was restored when 5&#8242;&#8208;boronic acid modified fragments were used for assembly. These studies show for the first time that boronate esters as internucleoside linkages can act as surrogates of natural phosphodiesters in functional RNA molecules.

     alt="Boronic Acid Assisted Self-Assembly of Functional RNAs"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boronate ester linkages can be formed in&#8197;situ by the reaction of an oligonucleotide bearing a 5&#8242;-boronic acid moiety with the 3&#8242;-terminal &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-diol of another oligonucleotide in a template-directed manner. Boronate ester bonds replacing the natural phosphodiesters in oligonucleotides have been shown to stabilize split hairpin ribozyme variants and a split version of the Mango aptamer, and restore activity.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boronate esters formed by reaction of an oligonucleotide carrying a 5&#8242;-boronic acid moiety with the 3&#8242;-terminal &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-diol of another have been shown previously to assist assembly of fragmented DNAzymes. Here we demonstrate that boronate esters replacing the natural phosphodiester linkage at selected sites of two functional RNAs, the hairpin ribozyme and the Mango aptamer, allow assembly of functional structures. The hairpin ribozyme, a small naturally occurring RNA that supports the reversible cleavage of appropriate RNA substrates, is very sensitive to fragmentation. Splitting the ribozyme at four different sites led to a significant decrease or even loss of cleavage and ligation activity. Ribozymes assembled from fragments capable of boronate ester formation showed restoration of cleavage activity in some but not all cases, dependent on the split site.

         <title>Matched Ligands for Small, Stable Colloidal Nanoparticles of Copper, Cuprous Oxide and Cuprous Sulfide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 35, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;small and stable colloidal nanoparticles of copper, cuprous oxide and cuprous sulfide were synthesized exploiting the organometallic chemistry of copper mesityl. Sub&#8208;stoichiometric quantities of X&#8208;type carboxylate and di(thio)carboxylate ligands were used to produce colloidal nanoparticles; the nature of the ligand influences both the nanoparticle solubility and stability.







Abstract
This work applies organometallic routes to copper(0/I) nanoparticles and describes how to match ligand chemistries with different material compositions. The syntheses involve reacting an organo&#8208;copper precursor, mesitylcopper(I) [CuMes]z (z=4, 5), at low temperatures and in organic solvents, with hydrogen, air or hydrogen sulfide to deliver Cu, Cu2O or Cu2S nanoparticles. Use of sub&#8208;stoichiometric quantities of protonated ligand (pro&#8208;ligand; 0.1&#8211;0.2&#8197;equivalents vs. [CuMes]z) allows saturation of surface coordination sites but avoids excess pro&#8208;ligand contaminating the nanoparticle solutions. The pro&#8208;ligands are nonanoic acid (HO2CR1), 2&#8208;[2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid (HO2CR2) or di(thio)nonanoic acid, (HS2CR1), and are matched to the metallic, oxide or sulfide nanoparticles. Ligand exchange reactions reveal that copper(0) nanoparticles may be coordinated by carboxylate or di(thio)carboxylate ligands, but Cu2O is preferentially coordinated by carboxylate ligands and Cu2S by di(thio)carboxylate ligands. This work highlights the opportunities for organometallic routes to well&#8208;defined nanoparticles and the need for appropriate ligand selection.

         <title>Overcoming Energy Transfer for the Metallophotoredox Catalyzed Decarboxylative Alkenylation between Alkylcarboxylic Acids and Enol Triflates</title>

Overcoming Energy Transfer for the metallophotoredox catalyzed decarboxylative alkenylation between alkylcarboxylic acids and enol triflates.







Abstract
Herein we report on the decarboxylative alkenylation between alkyl carboxylic acids and enol triflates. The reaction is mediated by a dual catalytic nickel and iridium system, operating under visible light irradiation. Two competing catalytic pathways, from the excited state iridium photocatalyst, are identified. One is energy transfer from the excited state, resulting in formation of an undesired enol ester. The desired pathway involves electron transfer, resulting in decarboxylation to ultimately give the target product. The use of a highly oxidizing iridium photocatalyst is essential to control the reactivity. A diverse array of enol triflates and alkyl carboxylic acids are investigated, providing both scope and limitations of the presented methodology.

         <title>Ratiometric Fluorescence Assay for Pyrophosphate Based on Sulfur Nanodots Decorated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 35, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ratiometric fluorescent probe was developed by decorating a porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (PCN&#8208;224) with sulfur nanodots (S&#8208;dots). The red&#8208;fluorescence of PCN&#8208;224 was enhanced through decorating with S&#8208;dots, which was quenched by adding Cu2+. PPi can trigger the recovery of red &#8211; fluorescence, through relieving above coordination reactions. S&#8208;dots provided stable blue emissive component for effective reference of fluorescence ratiometric assay.







Abstract
Selective and sensitive detection of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) are of great significance both for clinical applications and fundamental research. In this work, a ratiometric fluorescent probe was developed by decorating a porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (PCN&#8208;224) with sulfur nanodots (S&#8208;dots). The red&#8208;fluorescence of PCN&#8208;224 was significantly promoted (more than 6&#8208;fold) by S&#8208;dots through inhibiting molecular motion of porphyrin ligand, which also provided active sites for the detection of Cu2+ and PPi. Cu2+ could selectively quench the red&#8208;fluorescence of PCN&#8208;224 through coordination with porphyrin ligand, and the competition reaction between PPi and Cu2+ resulted in the decomposing of coordination and recovery of red&#8208;fluorescence. The blue&#8208;fluorescence from S&#8208;dots was deemed as effective reference, which provided a built&#8208;in correction in complex environments. Based on these photophysical properties, a ratiometric fluorescence assay was developed for the quantitative detection of Cu2+ and PPi, with a limit of detection of 0.11 and 2.66&#8197;&#956;M, respectively. The accuracy and practical applications of assays were also demonstrated by detection in tap water and human serum samples.

         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;component umpolung cascade reaction of phenols, C60, and nucleophiles has been developed as a practical and efficient protocol for one&#8208;pot synthesis of diversified 1,4&#8208;[60]fullerephenols.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component umpolung cascade coupling reaction of phenols, C60, and different nucleophiles which includes H2O, alcohols, triphenylamines and carbazoles was developed. Furthermore, one&#8208;pot 1,4&#8208;bisphenol coupling on C60 has been realized by this method. This practical protocol features high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, wide substrate range, easy operation and low cost, thus providing a robust method for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of various unsymmetrical 1,4&#8208;[60]fullerephenols.

         <title>Cs2AgBiCl6: a Novel, High&#8208;Efficient and Stable Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalyst for Degradation of Organic Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 35, June 22, 2023. </description>

Let there be light: Cs2AgBiCl6 can rapidly degrade organic dyes under visible light, demonstrating an excellent photocatalytic activity, and has a good cycle stability, which indicate that Cs2AgBiCl6 may be a promising material to develop novel, high&#8208;efficient and stable visible&#8208;light photocatalyst.







Abstract
In the past decades, great efforts have been made to develop novel visible&#8208;light photocatalysts to achieve high photocatalytic efficiency by utilizing visible light, the largest proportion of solar energy. As a new type of photocatalyst materials, all&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;free halide double perovskites have begun to attract widespread interest. Herein, double perovskite Cs2AgBiCl6 was developed into a visible&#8208;light photocatalyst for degrading organic dyes. Cs2AgBiCl6 was prepared by the hydrochloric acid precipitation and anti&#8208;solvent recrystallization methods, respectively, and was used to degrade organic dyes under visible light. Samples prepared by the anti&#8208;solvent recrystallization method are smaller than those prepared by the hydrochloric acid precipitation method, which can degrade 95.7&#8201;% of Sudan III in 10&#8197;min and show excellent photocatalytic activity. The cyclic experiments demonstrate that Cs2AgBiCl6 has a good cycle stability. Moreover, Cs2AgBiCl6&#8208;AS also exhibits good photocatalytic degradation ability for Methyl red and Malachite green. These distinctive results indicate that Cs2AgBiCl6 may be a promising material for developing novel, high&#8208;efficient and stable visible&#8208;light photocatalysts.

         <title>Tr&#246;ger's Base&#8208;Based Cuboid Constructed by Chiral Self&#8208;Discrimination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 35, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cuboid constructed by self&#8208;discrimination of a chiral macrocycle (TBBP) is reported. Iodine vapor is used to stimulate the cuboid structure to transform its stacking mode. The cuboid&#8208;stacking mode collapsed and opened the sealed cavity of TBBP in the process of the formation of TBBP&#8208;iodine complexes. Additionally, TBBP shows high iodine uptake up to 3.43&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Cuboid, a basic geometric structure, has been widely applied in architecture and mathematics. In chemistry, the introduction of cuboid structures always provides a specific structural shape, enhances the stability of the structure and improves the performance of materials. Herein, a simple strategy exploiting self&#8208;discrimination to construct a cuboid&#8208;stacking crystal material is proposed, in which a chiral macrocycle (TBBP) based on Tr&#246;ger's base (TB) and benzophenone (BP) was synthesized as the building element of the cuboid. The cuboid is designed to be transformable compared with cuboid structures in previous work. For this reason, it is considered that the cuboid&#8208;stacking structure can be transformed through external stimulation. Iodine vapor is selected as the external stimulus to transform the cuboid&#8208;stacking structure due to the favorable interaction between iodine and the cuboid. The changes in the stacking mode of TBBP is studied by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD). To our surprise, this Tr&#246;ger's base&#8208;based cuboid shows strong iodine adsorption capacity up to 3.43&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 and exhibits potential as a crystal material for iodine adsorption.

One of the unsolved problems in NMR methods of stereochemical assignment is related to the improper calculation of the conformational landscape of flexible molecules that have functional groups capable of generating a complex network of intramolecular H&#8208;bonding (IHB) interactions. Here the authors present MESSI (Multi&#8208;Ensemble Strategy for Structural Identification), a method inspired by the wisdom of the crowd theory that breaks with the traditional mono&#8208;ensemble approach. By including independent mappings of selected artificially manipulated ensembles, MESSI greatly improves the sense of the assignment by neutralizing potential energy biases.







Abstract
The use of quantum&#8208;based NMR methods to complement and guide the connectivity and stereochemical assignment of natural and unnatural products has grown enormously. One of the unsolved problems is related to the improper calculation of the conformational landscape of flexible molecules that have functional groups capable of generating a complex network of intramolecular H&#8208;bonding (IHB) interactions. Here the authors present MESSI (Multi&#8208;Ensemble Strategy for Structural Identification), a method inspired by the wisdom of the crowd theory that breaks with the traditional mono&#8208;ensemble approach.

         <title>Reversible Pressure&#8208;Magnetic Modulation in a Tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;Based Dyad Piezochromic Dysprosium Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet
</title>

The Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet behaviour of an isotopically enriched dysprosium piezochromic mononuclear complex was modulated by applying an external pressure.







Abstract
The extreme sensitivity of trivalent lanthanide ions to crystal field variations led to the emergence of single&#8208;molecule magnetic switching under various stimuli. The use of pressure as an external stimulus instead of classic light irradiation, oxidation or any chemical reactions allows a fine tuning of the magnetic modulation. Here the well&#8208;known pure isotopically enriched [162Dy(tta)3(L)]&#8901;C6H14 (162Dy) Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) (tta&#8722;=2&#8208;2&#8208;thenoyltrifluoroacetonate and L=4,5&#8208;bis(propylthio)&#8208;tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)benzimidazole&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridine) was experimentally investigated by single&#8208;crystal diffraction and squid magnetometry under high applied pressures. Both reversible piezochromic properties and pressure modulation of the slow magnetic relaxation behavior were demonstrated and supported by ab initio calculations. The magnetic study of the diluted sample [162Dy0.05Y0.95(tta)3(L)]&#8901;C6H14 (162Dy@Y) indicated that variations in the electronic structure have mainly intermolecular origin with weak intramolecular contribution. Quantitative magnetic interpretation concludes to a deterioration of the Orbach process for the benefit of both Raman and QTM mechanisms under applied pressure.

One&#8208;pot of Pd(II) catalyzed multiple C&#8208;H activation, via &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsubstituted&#8208;BODIPYs react with 1,8&#8208;dibromonaphthalenes to obtain acenaphtho[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs. These newly synthesized acenaphtho[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs showed strong deep red absorptions/emissions and high fluorescence quantum yields.







Abstract
Aromatic ring fusion on BODIPY core can effectively tune its electronic property, and red&#8208;shift its absorption and emission wavelength. In this work, we report that a one&#8208;pot Pd(II) catalyzed multiple C&#8722;H activation to access acenaphtho[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs though the reaction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsubstituted&#8208;BODIPYs and 1,8&#8208;dibromonaphthalenes. These newly synthesized acenaphtho[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs revealed intensified deep red absorptions (639&#8211;669&#8197;nm) and emissions (643&#8211;683&#8197;nm), with high fluorescence quantum yields (0.53&#8211;0.84) in dichloromethane. Notably, these acenaphtho[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs exhibited well&#8208;defined self&#8208;aggregation behavior in water/THF mixture, and for instance, the absorption of 3&#8201;a was red&#8208;shifted by 53&#8197;nm to 693&#8197;nm after forming aggregates.

         <title>Development of the Safe and Broad&#8208;Spectrum Aldehyde and Ketoamide Mpro inhibitors Derived from the Constrained &#945;, &#947;&#8208;AA Peptide Scaffold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 35, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of constrained &#945;, &#947;&#8208;AA peptides served as a novel scaffold to design aldehydes and ketoamides to inhibit the Mpro of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. They show excellent inhibitory activity against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and broad&#8208;spectrum activity against different other HCoVs. The X&#8208;ray structure of Mpro with inhibitors demonstrated the mechanism of covalent inhibition of Mpro.







Abstract
SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 is still wreaking havoc all over the world with surging morbidity and high mortality. The main protease (Mpro) is essential in the replication of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, enabling itself an active target for antiviral development. Herein, we reported the design and synthesis of a new class of peptidomimetics&#8208;constrained &#945;, &#947;&#8208;AA peptides, based on which a series of aldehyde and ketoamide inhibitors of the Mpro of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 were prepared. The lead compounds showed excellent inhibitory activity in the FRET&#8208;based Mpro enzymatic assay not only for the Mpro of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 but also for SARS&#8208;CoV and MERS&#8208;CoV, along with HCoVs like HCoV&#8208;OC43, HCoV&#8208;229E, HCoV&#8208;NL63 and HKU1. The X&#8208;ray crystallographic results demonstrated that our compounds form a covalent bond with the catalytic Cys145. They also demonstrated effective antiviral activity against live SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Overall, the results suggest that &#945;, &#947;&#8208;AA peptide could be a promising molecular scaffold in designing novel Mpro inhibitors of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and other coronaviruses.

         <title>Excited State Processes in Supramolecular Complexes of Cyclic Dibenzopyrrolopyrrole Isomers with C60 Fullerene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 35, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient charge separation and low sensitivity to the spatial orientation of monomeric units in tetramer make host&#8211;guest complexes of cyclic dibenzopyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrroles attractive for photovoltaic applications.







Abstract
An approach to modulating the properties of carbon nanorings by incorporating pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole units is of particular interest due to the combined effect of heteroatom and antiaromatic character on electronic properties. The inclusion of units other than phenylene leads to the formation of stereoisomers. In this work, we computationally study how the spatial orientation of monomeric units in the ring affects the properties of cyclic dibenzopyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrroles and their complexes with C60 fullerene. For [4]PP and [4]DHPP, the most symmetrical AAAA isomer is the most stable and forms stronger interactions with fullerene than the isomers where one or two monomeric units are flipped, mostly due to less Pauli repulsion. &#960;&#8208;Electron delocalization in the monomeric unit is crucial for directing the electron transfer (from or to nanoring). The energy of excited states with charge transfer depends on the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, which varies from one stereoisomer to another only for [4]DHPP&#8835;C60 with aromatic 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole units. The rates of electron transfer and charge recombination reactions are relatively weakly dependent of the spatial isomerism of nanorings.

         <title>Numerical Simulation and Experimental Study of Methyl Ammonium Bismuth Iodide Absorber Layer Based Lead Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 35, June 22, 2023. </description>

SCAPS&lt;?&#8194;&gt;1D simulation software was to investigate the simulation of lead&#8208;free methyl ammonium bismuth iodide (MA3Bi2I9) based perovskite solar cells. The study examined various electron and hole transport layers and optimized the thickness of each layer using the software. The results showed a power conversion efficiency of 14.07&#8201;% via the simulation software, and reasonable efficiency and open circuit voltage in the fabricated MA3Bi2I9 based perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
In the past few years, there has been a significant increase in the development and production of perovskite or perovskite&#8208;like materials that do not contain lead (Pb) for the purpose of constructing solar cells. The development and testing of lead&#8208;free perovskite&#8208;like structures for solar cells is crucial. In this study, we used the solar cell capacitance software (SCAPS) to simulate perovskite solar cells based on methyl ammonium bismuth iodide (MA3Bi2I9). The electron&#8208;transport layer, hole&#8208;transport layer, and absorber layer thickness were optimized using SCAPS. The simulated perovskite solar cells (FTO/TiO2/MA3Bi2I9/spiro&#8208;OMeTAD/Au) performed well with a power conversion efficiency of 14.07&#8201;% and a reasonable open circuit voltage of 1.34&#8197;V, using the optimized conditions determined by SCAPS. Additionally, we conducted experiments to fabricate perovskite solar cells under controlled humidity, which showed a power conversion efficiency of 1.31&#8201;%.

A dual catalytic approach combining photocatalyst and selenium&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acid synergy for the cyclization of N&#8208;propargylamides to oxazole aldehydes is disclosed, wherein vinyl selenium and hydroperoxide are involved as the key intermediates.







Abstract
A dual catalytic approach combining photocatalyst and selenium&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acid synergy has been used to cyclized of N&#8208;propargylamides. This method offers readily access to oxazole aldehydes under chemical oxidant&#8208;free conditions with low catalyst loadings, where air acts as a terminal and gratuitous oxidant. The reaction is demonstrated with a range of substrates, including aryl and alkyl propargyl amides, and in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of several amide&#8208;containing drug molecules. Mechanistic studies suggest that the acridinium catalyst is able to oxidize diselenide and generate singlet oxygen (1O2), which is responsible for this transformation.

         <title>An Efficient Light&#8208;Mediated Protocol for the Direct Amide Bond Formation via a Novel Carboxylic Acid Photoactivation Mode by Pyridine&#8208;CBr4</title>

A UVA&#8208;light&#8208;mediated synthesis of amides from carboxylic acids and amines or amino acids is presented, taking advantage of a novel photoactivation mode using pyridine&#8208;CBr4. Mechanistic studies by DI&#8208;HRMS provide experimental evidence for the formation of various intermediates. Application in the synthesis of industrially interesting or bioactive compounds was demonstrated.







Abstract
The direct amide bond formation between a carboxylic acid and an amine still constitutes a challenging reaction for both academia and industry. We demonstrate herein that several pairs of amines (halogen bond acceptors) and organohalogen sources may be used for the photochemical amidation reaction under either UVA or sunlight irradiation. Our studies led to the identification of pyridine&#8208;CBr4 as an efficient agent to perform amide synthesis under LED 370&#8197;nm irradiation, avoiding super&#8208;stoichiometric quantities. An extended substrate scope was demonstrated, showing that the widely used amino and carboxyl protecting groups are compatible with this photochemical protocol, while a number of industrially interesting products and bioactive compounds were synthesized. Direct infusion&#8208;high resolution mass spectrometry studies suggest an unprecedented type of carboxylic acid activation mode upon irradiation, involving the generation of a symmetric anhydride, an active ester with pyridine N&#8208;oxide and a mixed anhydride with hypobromous acid.

         <title>DFT Mechanistic Investigation on Manganese Pincer Complex Catalysed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Methanol with Benzyl Alcohol to Afford Methyl Benzoate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 35, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A density functional theory (DFT) study unveils the nature of the cross&#8208;coupling of methanol with benzyl alcohol to afford methyl benzoate catalysed by Mn&#8208;PNN pincer complex. Three catalytic cycles of the dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, the coupling of benzaldehyde with methanol to hemiacetal and the dehydrogenation of hemiacetal to methyl benzoate were investigated.







Abstract
In this paper the density functional theory (DFT) method was employed to investigate the cross&#8208;coupling of methanol with benzyl alcohol to afford methyl benzoate, catalysed by Mn&#8208;PNN pincer complex. The whole reaction process mainly includes three stages: the dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, the coupling of benzaldehyde with methanol to hemiacetal and the dehydrogenation of hemiacetal to methyl benzoate. The calculated results indicated that two dehydrogenation processes are influenced by two competitive mechanisms of inner and outer spheres. Dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde is the rate&#8208;determining step of the whole reaction, with the energy barrier of 22.1&#8197;kcal/mol. In addition, the regeneration of catalyst is also extremely important. Compared with direct dehydrogenation, the dehydrogenation mode assisted by formic acid is more advantageous. This work might provide theoretical insights and shed light on the design of cheap transition&#8208;metal catalysts for the dehydrogenation reaction.

Amphiphilicity in the same direction: The singlet carbene centre in [(MCp*)2(&#956;&#8208;NPh)(&#956;&#8208;C)] (1M, M=Fe, Ru, Os) displays ambiphilic reactivity in the same direction which can be attributed to the possible excitation from an spn&#8208;hybrid lone pair orbital to the low&#8208;lying transition metal&#8208;centred orbitals.







Abstract
Singlet carbenes are extensively studied compounds capable of electrophilic, nucleophilic or ambiphilic behaviour. The ambiphilic reactivity of singlet carbenes has been conventionally observed in orthogonal planes. Here, we report a detailed bonding and reactivity study of a homobimetallic carbon complex [(MCp*)2(&#956;&#8208;NPh)(&#956;&#8208;C)] (1M, M=Fe, Ru, Os) that shows ambiphilicity in the same direction. The structure of this complex can be considered as two fused three&#8208;membered M&#8722;C&#8722;M and M&#8722;N&#8722;M rings. The bonding analysis suggests that these 17 valence electron homobimetallic complexes have one formal M&#8722;M bond with a bridging carbene centre featuring a high&#8208;lying spn&#8208;hybridised lone pair. Accordingly, the carbene centre shows high proton affinity and act as a good 2e&#8722; donor to Lewis acids and transition metal fragment. Apart from the transition metal non&#8208;bonding electrons, the &#960;&#8208;framework of M&#8722;C&#8722;M and M&#8722;N&#8722;M arms can be best described as 3c&#8211;2e&#8722; bonds. The two transition metals in the four&#8208;membered skeleton generate many low&#8208;lying, virtual orbitals. These low&#8208;lying virtual orbitals induce electron excitation from the spn&#8208;hybrid orbital in presence of H&#8722; and other 2e&#8722; donor ligands such as PMe3, NHC and CO. Hence, the spn&#8208;hybrid lone pair orbital shows &#963;&#8208;hole reactivity in presence of Lewis bases.

         <title>A Greener Pathway to Enantiopurity: Mechanochemical Deracemization through Abrasive Grinding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 35, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiopurity is of crucial importance for compounds of biological interest. Over the last decade, various solution&#8208;based deracemization technologies have been introduced, transforming a racemic mixture into an enantiopure compound. Here we thrust deracemization into the era of Green Chemistry, being the first to enable deracemization mechanochemically, with as a bonus deracemization occurring over a matter of hours instead of days as observed for the solution&#8208;based processes.







Abstract
We report the first case of mechanochemical deracemization by using liquid&#8208;assisted abrasive grinding. The target molecule is a precursor of Paclobutrazol, an important fungicide and plant growth inhibitor. Using mechanochemical deracemization, we are even able to transform a 10&#8201;%&#8201;ee scalemic mixture of this latter in an enantioenriched product of 97&#8201;%&#8201;ee in a couple of hours. This is substantially shorter compared to solution&#8208;based deracemization methodologies. The present paper thus introduces an efficient and greener process to enantiopure material.

The present paper thus introduces an efficient and greener process to enantiopure material.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The first mixed&#8208;ligand self&#8208;assembly reactions of the organometallic diantimony complex [(Cp)2Mo2(CO)4(&#956;,&#951;2&#8208;Sb2)] (C) with Ag[TEF] ([TEF]=[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]) in the presence of various N&#8208;donor molecules are presented. Depending on the organic linker, these reactions lead to the formation of two 0D, three 1D or one 2D novel hybrid organometallic&#8211;organic supramolecular aggregates. One of the polymeric assemblies represents a unique compound incorporating both Sb&#8208; and N&#8208;donor ligands as connectors for metal ions.







Abstract
The reactions of the organometallic ligand complex [Cp2Mo2(CO)4(&#956;,&#951;2&#8208;Sb2)] (C) with Ag[TEF] ([TEF]&#8722;=[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]&#8722;) in the presence of a number of di&#8208; or polytopic N&#8208;donor molecules (1,6,7,12&#8208;tetraazaperylene (L1), 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyrimidine (L2), 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (L3), trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethylene (L4) and 1,3&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)propane (L5)), were studied. Depending on the reaction stoichiometry and choice of linker, these reactions lead to the selective formation of dimeric or tetrameric supramolecular coordination complexes as well as 1D and 2D coordination polymers (CPs). The presented compounds are unique examples of supramolecular complexes incorporating both organometallic Sb&#8208;donor and organic N&#8208;donor molecules as ligands to stabilize metal ions. Moreover, one of the formed compounds, the CP [Ag4(&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;C)4(L4)4]n[TEF]4n, represents an exceptional 1D polymer incorporating both N&#8208; and Sb&#8208;donor ligands as connectors for metal ions.

         <title>Unique Tubular BiOBr/g&#8208;C3N4 Heterojunction with Efficient Separation of Charge Carriers for Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 35, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis the hollow tubular g&#8208;C3N4 composite catalysts modified by flower&#8208;like BiOBr for photocatalytic nitrogen fixation. The NH3 generation rate of the BC&#8208;2 is 255.04&#8197;&#956;mol&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 and has robust durability. The high photocatalytic nitrogen fixation activity of BC&#8208;2 can be attributed to the large specific surface area and the full use of visible light by the multi&#8208;scattering effect of light.







Abstract
The industrial ammonia synthesis process consumes a lot of energy and causes serious environmental pollution. As a sustainable approach for ammonia synthesis, photocatalytic nitrogen reduction employing water as the reducing agent has a lot of potential. A simple surfactant&#8208;assisted solvothermal method is used to synthesize g&#8208;C3N4 nanotubes with flower&#8208;like spherical BiOBr grown inside and outside (BiOBr/g&#8208;C3N4, BC). The hollow tubular structure realizes the full use of visible light by the multi&#8208;scattering effect of light. Large surface areas and more active sites for N2 adsorption and activation are present in the distinctive spatially dispersed hierarchical structures. Particularly, the quick separation and transfer of electrons and holes are facilitated by the sandwich tubular heterojunctions and tight contact interface of BiOBr and g&#8208;C3N4. The maximal NH3 generation rate of the BiOBr/g&#8208;C3N4 composite catalysts can reach 255.04&#8197;&#956;mol&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, and it is 13.9 and 5.8&#8197;times that of pure BiOBr and g&#8208;C3N4. This work provides a novel method for designing and constructing unique heterojunctions for efficient photocatalytic nitrogen fixation.

         <title>Redox Reporter &#8208; Ligand Competition to Support Signaling in the Cocaine&#8208;Binding Electrochemical Aptamer&#8208;Based Biosensor</title>

Electrochemical aptamer&#8208;based (E&#8208;AB) biosensors: Here we show that methylene blue&#8208;modified E&#8208;AB sensors designed with the cocaine&#8208;binding aptamer, in contrast to the widely accepted binding&#8208;induced conformational change mechanism, rather undergoes a &#8220;redox reporter&#8208;ligand competition&#8221; mechanism. We foresee that our proposed mechanism will open new avenues in designing aptamers and E&#8208;AB sensors.







Abstract
Electrochemical aptamer&#8208;based (E&#8208;AB) biosensors have demonstrated capabilities in monitoring molecules directly in undiluted complex matrices and in the body with the hopes of addressing personalized medicine challenges. This sensing platform relies on an electrode&#8208;bound, redox&#8208;reporter&#8208;modified aptamer. The electrochemical signal is thought to originate from the aptamer undergoing a binding&#8208;induced conformational change capable of moving the redox reporter closer to the electrode surface. While this is the generally accepted mechanism, it is notable that there is limited evidence demonstrating conformational change or distance&#8208;dependent change in electron transfer rates in E&#8208;AB sensors. In response, we investigate here the signal transduction of the well&#8208;studied cocaine&#8208;binding aptamer with different analytical methods and found that this sensor relies on a redox&#8208;reporter &#8208; ligand competition mechanism rather than a ligand&#8208;induced structure formation mechanism. Our results show that the covalently bound redox reporter, methylene blue, binds at or near the ligand binding site on the aptamer resulting in a folded conformation of the cocaine&#8208;binding aptamer. Addition of ligand then competes with the redox reporter for binding, altering its electron transfer rate. While we show this for the cocaine&#8208;binding aptamer, given the prevalence of methylene blue in E&#8208;AB sensors, a similar competition&#8208;based may occur in other systems.

         <title>A Novel C Doped MoS2/CoP/MoO2 Ternary Heterostructure Nanoflower for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction at Wide pH Range and Efficient Overall Water Splitting in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 35, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binary heterostructure Nanoflower MoS2/Co1.2MoO4.2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.2H2O supported on BC was prepared by hydrothermal reaction. C doped MoS2/CoP/MoO2 ternary heterostructure Nanoflower was synthesized in&#8197;situ by high&#8208;temperature phosphating technology.







Abstract
The development of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;efficiency bifunctional catalysts is still a challenge for hydrogen production through overall water splitting. This paper reports the in&#8208;situ synthesis of C&#8208;doped MoS2/CoP/MoO2 using bacterial cellulose (BC) as the reducing agent and the source of C and using BC (MoS2/Co1.2MoO4.2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.2H2O/BC) as the template.

Due to the large number of defect sites caused by C doping and the synergy between these three active components (MoS2, CoP and MoO2), the HER and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities of the catalyst have been greatly improved. Therefore, during HER, a small initial overpotential (27&#8197;mV) was achieved in 1.0&#8197;M KOH. In 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4, 0.1&#8197;M PBS and 1.0&#8197;M KOH, the current density reached 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at overpotentials of 123.4, 150, and 139&#8197;mV, respectively. For OER, an overpotential of 268&#8197;mV was required to achieve 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The alkaline two&#8208;electrode device composed of C doped MoS2/CoP/MoO2 delivers 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a low potential of 1.51&#8197;V and can be easily driven by a single AA battery. This work provides a new design strategy of C doped ternary heterostructures for electrocatalysis and related energy applications.

         <title>Bonding in Low&#8208;Coordinated Organoarsenic and Organoantimony Compounds: A Threshold Photoelectron Spectroscopic Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 35, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methyl and methylene compounds of arsenic and antimony have been studied by photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy to investigate their relative stability with the help of pyrolysis. While organoarsenic compounds show a variety of methyl and methylene compounds, like HAsCH2, antimony only shows Sb&#8722;CH3. In the condensed phase, the precursors E(CH3)3 (E=As, Sb) are relatively poor sources of methyl radicals.







Abstract
Methyl and methylene compounds of arsenic and antimony have been studied by photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy to investigate their relative stability. While for As both HAs=CH2, As&#8722;CH3 and the methylene compound As=CH2 are identified in the spectrum, the only Sb compound observed is Sb&#8722;CH3. Thus, there is a step in the main group&#8197;15 between As and Sb, regarding the relative stability of the methyl compounds. Ionisation energies, vibrational frequencies and spin&#8208;orbit splittings were determined for the methyl compound from photoion mass&#8208;selected photoelectron spectra. Although the spectroscopic results for organoantimony resemble those for the previously investigated bismuth compounds, EPR spectroscopic experiments indicate a far lower tendency for methyl transfer for Sb(CH3)3 compared to Bi(CH3)3. This study concludes investigations on low&#8208;valent organopnictogen compounds.

         <title>Deoxygenative Radical Boration of Inert Amides via a Combination of Relay and Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 35, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deoxygenative boration of widely occurring amides is developed, which combines relay and cooperative catalysis with Ir&#8208;photoredox&#8208;organo catalysis to build structurally diverse &#945;&#8208;amino organoborons in one pot. The boryl radical generated in&#8197;situ is applied as the functionalization partner instead of traditional nucleophile in this reductive transformation of amides, thus overcoming the limitation of [C]&#8208;functionalization reagents to deliver high value&#8208;added &#945;&#8208;boryl amines.







Abstract
One of the most challenging tasks in organic synthesis is to develop novel methodologies for rapid construction of complex molecules starting from easily available yet inert raw materials. In this context, multi&#8208;catalysis strategies have attracted great attention in the discovery of new reactivity profiles that may allow access to many difficult or unattainable transformations. So far the deoxygenative functionalization of ubiquitous amides is usually achieved by nucleophilic attack on the imine or iminium ion intermediate formed via activation of the C=O bond, and these functionalization reagents were often confined to C&#8208;based nucleophiles, which largely limited the diversity of the resultant amines. Herein, we disclose a combined strategy of relay and cooperative catalysis with a triple iridium&#8208;photoredox&#8208;organocatalysis system to achieve an unprecedented reductive boration of amides, affording valuable &#945;&#8208;amino boron products which are viable building blocks. In this transformation, the Ir&#8208;catalyzed semi&#8208;reduction of amides is successfully incorporated with photo&#8208;organic catalyzed nucleophilic boryl radical addition, thus delivering the corresponding &#945;&#8208;boryl amines in high efficiency.

Biradical formation vs. &#960;&#8208;bonding: The low&#8208;valent, highly reactive pnictogen compounds PnCH3 (Pn=As, Sb) have been generated in situ by controlled homolysis of Pn(CH3)3 in the gas phase and investigated by photoelectron&#8211;photoion coincidence spectroscopy. This allowed us to establish trends in nature's strategy to stabilize low&#8208;valent pnictogen species either by tautomerization with concomitant multiple bond formation (HPn=CH2) or by biradical formation (Pn&#8722;CH3). The graphic illustrates the energetic steps separating the isomers of these fundamentally important group 15 compounds. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Lichtenberg, P. Hemberger, I. Fischer and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300637).

         <title>Cover Feature: Organometallic&#8211;Organic Hybrid Assemblies Featuring the Diantimony Complex [Cp2Mo2(CO)4(&#956;,&#951;2&#8208;Sb2)], AgI Ions and N&#8208;Donor Molecules as Building Blocks (Chem. Eur. J. 35/2023)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 35, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first supramolecular assemblies composed of the organometallic diantimony complex [(Cp)2Mo2(CO)4(&#956;,&#951;2&#8208;Sb2)], AgI ions and various N&#8208;donor molecules are presented; the cover feature depicts the synthesis of these organometallic&#8211;organic aggregates as a fascinating, yet challenging, adventure. The crossroads in the middle reflects the dependency of the final product's structure and dimensionality (0D, 1D, or even 2D) on N&#8208;donor ligand choice and highlights the importance of fine tuning of the reaction conditions. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Scheer and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300610).

         <title>Small Molecular Fluorescent Probes for Alzheimer's Disease Associated Active Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 35, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The small&#8208;molecule fluorescent probes for Alzheimer's disease&#8208;related bioactive species are summarized. The chemical structures, response mechanisms, bioapplications of all the probes are presented. The further challenges and instructions for new Alzheimer's disease associated fluorescent probes are also provided.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and is the main cause of dementia worldwide. As the pathogenesis of AD is quite complicated, there is continuous attention to AD&#8208;associated active species, such as amyloid&#8208;&#946; plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, metal ions, reactive oxygen/nitrogen/sulphur species, cholinesterase, viscosity, formaldehyde and so on. To this end, a series of small molecular fluorescent probes for these active species have been explored for early diagnosis and even remedy of AD. Herein, we systematacially summarize the versatile fluorescent probes mainly in recent three years, including the relationship between the structure and properties as well as the targeted diagnosis and imaging application of all these fluorescent probes. Moreover, the challenges and perspectives of the AD&#8208;related fluorescent probes are briefly explicated. We firmly expect this review may provide guidance for constructing new AD&#8208;relevant fluorescent probes and promote the clinical study of AD.

         <title>NAD(P)H:Quinone Acceptor Oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) Activatable Salicylamide H+/Cl&#8210; Transporters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NAD(P)H:quinone acceptor oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), a detoxifying enzyme overexpressed in tumors, plays a key role in protecting cancer cells against oxidative stress and thus has been considered an attractive candidate for activating prodrug(s). Herein, we report the first use of NQO1 for the selective activation of &#8216;protransporter&#8217; systems in cancer cells leading to the induction of apoptosis. Salicylamides, easily synthesizable small molecules, have been effectively used for efficient H+/Cl&#8210; symport across lipid membranes. The ion transport activity of salicylamides was efficiently abated by caging the OH group with NQO1 activatable quinones via either ether or ester linkage. The release of active transporters, following the reduction of quinone caged &#8216;protransporters&#8217; by NQO1, was verified. Both the transporters and protransporters exhibited significant toxicity towards the MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer line, mediated via the induction of oxidative stress, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and lysosomal deacidification. Induction of cell death via intrinsic apoptotic pathway was verified by monitoring PARP1 cleavage.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Investigations on Bismuth Catalyzed Reduction of Ketones and Phosphine Oxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the inferences from the mechanistic studies on the catalytic reduction of ketones and phosphine oxides using the organobismuth dication [NMe2C6H4Bi(L)3][Al{OC(CF3)3}4] in the presence of silanes as reducing agents. Experiments and computations converge to a Si&#8722;H activation pathway in the reduction process.







Abstract
Lewis acidic bismuth compounds have found catalytic applications in the reduction of unsaturated bonds. In this work, we present the inferences from the mechanistic studies on the catalytic reduction of ketones and phosphine oxides using the organobismuth dication [NMe2C6H4Bi(L)3][Al{OC(CF3)3}4]2 in the presence of silanes as reducing agents. Experiments and computations converge to a Si&#8722;H activation pathway in the reduction process.

&lt;p&gt;Lewis acidic bismuth compounds have found catalytic applications in the reduction of unsaturated bonds. In this work, we present the inferences from the mechanistic studies on the catalytic reduction of ketones and phosphine oxides using the organobismuth dication [NMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Bi(L)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;][Al{OC(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the presence of silanes as reducing agents.

         <title>Isolation, Structural and Physical Characterization as well as Reactivity of Persistent Acenium Radical Cation Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first stable salts of unsubstituted radical cations of anthracene, tetracene and pentacene were isolated in the condensed phase by deelectronation of the respective neutral acenes. The radical cation salts were structurally, electrochemically and spectroscopically characterized (IR, Raman, UV&#8208;Vis, EPR).







Abstract
The unsubstituted acenium radical cations (ARCs) are extremely sensitive and were hitherto only studied in&#8197;situ, i.&#8201;e. in the gas phase, as dilute solutions in strong acids or by matrix isolation spectroscopy at about 10&#8197;K. In this study, room temperature stable ARC salts with the weakly coordinating anion [F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (ORF=&#8722;OC(CF3)3) supported by the weakly coordinating solvent 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene (TFB) were prepared and structurally, electrochemically and spectroscopically characterized. Reaction of the neutral acenes with Ag+[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; led, non&#8208;innocent,[54] to intermediate [Ag2(acene)2]2+ complexes, which decompose over time to Ag0 and the corresponding (impure) ARC salts. By contrast, direct deelectronation with the recently developed innocent[54] deelectronator radical cation salt [anthraceneHal]+&#8901;[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; led to phase&#8208;pure products [acene]+&#8901;[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (anthraceneHal=9,10&#8208;dichlorooctafluoroanthracene; acene=anthra&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, pentacene). For the first time, a homogenous set of spectroscopic data on analytically pure ARC salts was obtained. In addition, cyclovoltammetric measurements of the acenes connected the potentials in solution with those in the gas&#8208;phase. Hence, the data complement the existing isolated gas&#8208;phase, strong acid or matrix isolation studies. A first entry to follow&#8208;up chemistry of the acenium radical cations as ligand forming oxidizers was demonstrated by reaction with 
 Co2(CO)8 giving [Co(anthracene)(CO)2]+.

         <title>Molecular and Crystal Structure, Spectroscopy, and Photochemistry of a Dispiro Compound Bearing the Tetraoxane Pharmacophore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The molecular structure and photochemistry of&#160;dispiro[cyclohexane&#8208;1,3'&#8208;[1,2,4,5]tetraoxane&#8208;6',2''&#8208;tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]decan]&#8208;4&#8208;one&#160;(TX), an antiparasitic 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetraoxane, was investigated using matrix isolation IR and EPR spectroscopies, and quantum chemical calculations at the DFT(B3LYP)/6&#8208;311++G(3df,3pd) level of theory. Photolysis of the matrix&#8208;isolated&#160;TX, induced by&#160;in situ&#160;broadband (l&#160;&gt; 235 nm) or narrowband (l&#160;in the range 220&#8208;263 nm) irradiation, led to two photoproducts, oxepane&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione and 4&#8208;oxohomoadamantan&#8208;5&#8208;one.&#160;&#160;Our studies show that these photoproducts result from initial photoinduced cleavage of an O&#8211;O bond, with formation of an oxygen&#8208;centered diradical that regioselectivity rearranges to a more stable (secondary carbon&#8208;centered)/(oxygen&#8208;centered) diradical, then yielding the final products. Formation of the diradical species was confirmed by EPR measurements, upon photolysis of&#160;TX&#160;at&#160;&#955;&#160;= 266 nm, in acetonitrile ice (T&#160;= 10&#8208;80 K). Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) studies demonstrated that&#160;TXadopts nearly the same conformation in the crystal and under matrix&#8208;isolation conditions, revealing that intermolecular interactions in the&#160;TX&#160;crystal are weak. This result is in keeping with observed similarities between the infrared spectra of crystalline and matrix&#8208;isolated&#160;TX. The structural, vibrational, and photochemical data reported here is relevant to the practical uses of&#160;TX (and tetraoxane analogues)&#160;in medicinal chemistry, considering its efficient and broad parasiticidal properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Polycrystalline Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Membranes for Separation of Light Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fabrication strategies of polycrystalline MOF membranes and the corresponding performance in separation of light hydrocarbons were classified and summarized. In addition, the perspective of this topic has also been proposed.







Abstract
Due to facile designability and versatile nanospace, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been considered as promising membrane materials. Compared to the mixed matrix membranes that incorporated with MOF particles, the polycrystalline MOF membranes demonstrates significant advantages in maximum utilizing the crystalline nanospace, and thus yielding a fruitful of achievements in the last twenty years. Although some reviews have summarized the development of MOF&#8208;based membranes, the theoretical framework for oriented design and preparation of polycrystalline MOF membranes for highly efficient separation of light hydrocarbons remains in infancy. Herein, in this review, the fabrication strategies of polycrystalline MOF membranes and the corresponding performance in the separation of light hydrocarbons were classified and summarized. Particularly, the MOF membranes with global and local dynamics have been proposed as an interesting topic promoted performance.

         <title>Nonorthogonal Cascade Catalysis in Multicompartment Micelles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acid&#8208;base bifunctional multicompartment micelle prepared from amphiphilic bottlebrush copolymers is reported for the nonorthogonal reaction sequence: deacetalization&#8208;Knoevenagel condensation &#8211; Michael addition of acetals to 2&#8208;amino chromene derivatives. Multicompartment micelles are promising nanostructures for compartmentalization of nonorthogonal catalysts for multistep transformations.







Abstract
Multicompartment micelles (MCMs) containing acid and base sites in discrete domains are prepared from poly(norbornene)&#8208;based amphiphilic bottlebrush copolymers in aqueous media. The acid and base sites are localized in different compartments of the micelle, enabling the nonorthogonal reaction sequence: deacetalization &#8211; Knoevenagel condensation &#8211; Michael addition of acetals to 2&#8208;amino chromene derivatives. Computational simulations using dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) elucidated the bottlebrush composition required to effectively site&#8208;isolate the nonorthogonal catalysts. This contribution presents MCMs as a new class of nanostructures for one&#8208;pot multistep nonorthogonal cascade catalysis, laying the groundwork for the isolation of three or more incompatible catalysts to synthesize value&#8208;added compounds in a single reaction vessel, in water.

         <title>Merger of Rotation Restriction and Symmetrical Push&#8208;Pull to Synthesize Single&#8208;Benzene Yellow Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of symmetrical push&#8208;pull motifs in combination with restricting bond rotations to suppress molecular motions that cause non&#8208;radiative transitions is the key to creating small yet brightly emitting fluorophores. The tetrahydrobenzodifuran moiety is an effective core architecture to realize unique and powerful single&#8208;benzene fluorophores with high quantum yields and large Stokes shifts in a wide range of solvents.







Abstract
Small yet brightly emitting fluorophores should find fundamental and practical applications in both academic and industrial settings. In this report, tetrahydrobenzodifuran is used as the core architecture to create novel single&#8208;benzene fluorophores. The key for realizing unique and powerful photophysical properties is the combination of the construction of symmetrical push&#8208;pull motifs and the restriction of bond rotations to suppress molecular motions that cause non&#8208;radiative transitions.

         <title>Cyanine&#8208; and Rhodamine&#8208;Derived Alkynes for the Selective Targeting of Cancerous Mitochondria through Radical Thiol&#8208;Yne Coupling in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By exploiting the combined effects of structure&#8208;induced accumulation and stimuli&#8208;responsive reactivity, cancerous mitochondria were selectively targeted by using cyanine&#8208;aryl acetylene conjugates. Covalent fixation of the conjugates, which is promoted by elevated pH and ROS levels in cancerous mitochondria, occurs through radical thiol&#8208;yne coupling, although no radical&#8208;based mechanism had previously been observed in live cells.







Abstract
Despite their long history and their synthetic potential underlined by various recent advances, radical thiol&#8208;yne coupling reactions have so far only rarely been exploited for the functionalization of biomolecules, and no examples yet exist for their application in live cells &#8208; although natural thiols show widespread occurrence therein. By taking advantage of the particular cellular conditions of mitochondria in cancer cells, we have demonstrated that radical thiol&#8208;yne coupling represents a powerful reaction principle for the selective targeting of these organelles. Within our studies, fluorescently labeled reactive alkyne probes were investigated, for which the fluorescent moiety was chosen to enable both mitochondria accumulation as well as highly sensitive detection. After preliminary studies under cell&#8208;free conditions, the most promising alkyne&#8208;dye conjugates were evaluated in various cellular experiments comprising analysis by flow cytometry and microscopy. All in all, these results pave the way for improved future therapeutic strategies relying on live&#8208;cell compatibility and selectivity among cellular compartments.

         <title>Design of Cu&#8208;Substituted O3&#8208;Type NaFe0.5Mn0.5O2 Cathode Materials for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of different copper contents on the electrochemical performance of environmentally friendly CO/Ni&#8208;free O3&#8208;type Fe/Mn&#8208;based cathode is systematically investigated. The introduction of a high proportion of copper can simultaneously regulate both the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface and the bulk phase. Therefore, the obtained cathode material with an optimized component of NaCu0.20Fe0.30Mn0.50O2 achieves a significant improvement in electrochemical performance.







Abstract
O3&#8208;type Fe/Mn&#8208;based layered oxide cathode materials with abundant reserves have a promising prospect in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the electrochemical reversibility of most O3&#8208;type Fe/Mn&#8208;based oxide cathode materials is still not high enough. Herein, the effect of different Cu contents on the electrochemical properties of O3&#8208;NaFe0.50Mn0.50O2 materials is systematically investigated. The as&#8208;prepared NaFe0.30Mn0.50Cu0.20O2 cathode achieves the synergistic optimization of the interface and bulk phase. It shows superior electrochemical performance, with an initial discharge specific capacity of 114&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C, a capacity retention rate of 94&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C, and excellent chemical stability in air and water. In addition, the sodium ion full battery based on NaFe0.30Mn0.50Cu0.20O2 cathode and hard carbon anode has a capacity retention rate of 81&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles. This research provides a useful approach for the preparation of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance O3&#8208;type layered cathode materials.

         <title>Pushing the Boundary of Covalency in Lanthanoid&#8208;Tellurium Bonds: Insights from the Synthesis, Molecular and Electronic Structures of Low&#8208;Coordinate, Monomeric Europium(II) and Ytterbium(II) Tellurolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of low&#8208;coordinate, monomeric europium(II) and ytterbium(II) tellurolate complexes is achieved using hybrid tellurolate ligands containing N&#8208;donor pendant arms. According to DFT calculations, while the complexes have most of their lanthanoid&#8208;tellurium bonds located on the Te atoms, the lanthanoid metals contribute significantly to the bond, thus resulting in a notable covalency.







Abstract
Owing to the strict hard/soft dichotomy between the lanthanoids and tellurium atoms, and the strong affinity of lanthanoid ions for high coordination numbers, low&#8208;coordinate, monomeric lanthanoid tellurolate complexes have remained elusive as compared to the lanthanoid complexes with lighter group 16 elements (O, S, and Se). This makes the development of suitable ligand systems for low&#8208;coordinate, monomeric lanthanoid tellurolate complexes an appealing endeavor. In a first report, a series of low&#8208;coordinate, monomeric lanthanoid (Yb, Eu) tellurolate complexes were synthesized by utilizing hybrid organotellurolate ligands containing N&#8208;donor pendant arms. The reaction of bis[2&#8208;((dimethylamino)methyl)phenyl] ditelluride, 1 and 8,8&#8242;diquinolinyl ditelluride, 2 with Ln0 metals (Ln=Eu, Yb) resulted in the formation of monomeric complexes [LnII(TeR)2(Solv)2] [R=C6H4&#8208;2&#8208;CH2NMe2] [3: Ln=Eu, Solv=tetrahydrofuran; 4: Ln=Eu, Solv=acetonitrile; 5: Ln=Yb, Solv=tetrahydrofuran; 6: Ln=Yb, Solv=pyridine] and [EuII(TeNC9H6)2(Solv)n] (7: Solv=tetrahydrofuran, n=3; 8: Solv=1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane, n=2), respectively. Complexes 3&#8211;4 and 7&#8211;8 represent the first sets of examples of monomeric europium tellurolate complexes. The molecular structures of complexes 3&#8211;8 are validated by single&#8211;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. The electronic structures of these complexes were investigated using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, which revealed appreciable covalency between the tellurolate ligands and lanthanoids.

         <title>Alkali Metal Halide Ion&#8208;Pair Binding in Conformationally Dynamic Halogen Bonding Heteroditopic [2]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heteroditopic halogen bonding [2]rotaxanes display metal cation binding&#8208;induced co&#8208;conformational dynamism and significant positive cooperativity upon binding of alkali metal halide ion&#8208;pairs. Detailed analysis of the 1H&#8197;NMR titration spectra reveal a complex suite of parallel and competing equilibria which need to be considered to obtain reliable estimates of the rotaxanes&#8217; ion&#8208;pair binding affinities.







Abstract
A series of heteroditopic halogen bonding (XB) [2]rotaxanes were prepared via a combination of passive and active metal template&#8208;directed strategies. The ability of the [2]rotaxanes to bind alkali metal halide ion&#8208;pairs was investigated by extensive 1H&#8197;NMR titration studies, wherein detailed analysis of cation, anion and ion&#8208;pair affinity measurements indicate dramatic positive cooperative enhancements in halide anion association upon either Na+ or K+ pre&#8208;complexation. This study demonstrates that careful consideration of multiple, parallel and competing binding equilibria is essential when interpreting observed 1H&#8197;NMR spectral changes in ion&#8208;pair receptor systems, especially those which exhibit dynamic behaviour. Importantly, in comparison to XB [2]catenane analogues, these neutral XB heteroditopic [2]rotaxane host systems demonstrated that despite their relatively weaker cation and anion binding affinities, they exhibit a notably higher level of positive cooperativity for alkali metal halide ion&#8208;pair binding, highlighting the role of greater co&#8208;conformational adaptive behaviour in mechanically&#8208;bonded hosts for the purposes of charged species recognition.

         <title>Beyond the Limits of Atropochirality: Design of Highly Conformationally Restrained Biaryls with Bridgehead Phosphine Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atropochirality in 2,2&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted biaryls is a long&#8208;standing quest, and only the bulkiest substituents slow down their rotation. However, a new and rigid bicyclic scaffold has recently been developed. This scaffold has successfully pushed the limits of atropochirality even with substituents as small as fluorine atom. By using variable temperature NMR spectroscopy and DFT computational studies, insights about the mechanism of isomerisation were gained.







Abstract
In the last three decades, reacting sterically congested ortho&#8208;substituted arenes to form atropochiral biaryls is an appealing venture and a challenging subject that has garnered significant attention. Therefore, there is interest in developing methods to prepare these compounds. In this study, an efficient approach to produce a new class 2,2&#8217; disubstituted biaryls bridgehead phosphine oxides with an unusual topology and exceptional conformational stability is presented. Our methodology demonstrates that depending on the substitution pattern on the aryl moieties, the methanophosphocine backbone could be rigid enough to observe a double atropochirality, resulting in an under covered class of molecules. Notably, our studies revealed that replacing only one hydrogen at the ortho position by a fluorine atom led to sufficiently restricted rotation at temperatures below 80&#8201;&#176;C, extending &#8220;far away&#8221; the limits of atropostability. Finally, our investigations, which employed variable&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations, yielded unique insights into the isomerisation mechanism, indicating that the two biaryl motifs are fully independent in spite of their proximity.

         <title>Cyclic Polymers: Controlled Synthesis, Properties and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in controlled synthesis, applications, and future perspectives of cyclic polymers were reviewed and discussed. Major research efforts have been achieved to date regarding the synthesis of cyclic polymers which lead to the expansion of the scope and a growing diversity within this class of molecules. It is believed that a broad range of application prospects will be accessible in the future due to perpetual investigation in this research field. This review aims to turn the spotlight on synthetic strategies for cyclic polymers and encourages further research on this versatile compound class.







Abstract
Recently, cyclic polymers have attracted increasing interest due to their unique topologies, properties, and functions compared to the linear analogues. This mini&#8208;review focuses on the recent advances in the synthesis and applications of cyclic polymers. First, the main synthetic methods for cyclic polymers, namely ring closure and ring expansion methods, are presented and discussed, followed by a review on the exploration of the properties and applications of synthetic cyclic polymers. Finally, a critical assessment of the preliminary studies exploring the efficient synthesis and potential applications of cyclic polymers are presented, and the remaining challenges in the field as well as ideas for solving these challenges will be discussed.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework&#8208;Supported Metallocene for Ethylene Polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Loading of homogeneous catalysts with support can dramatically improve their performance in olefin polymerization. However, the challenge lies in the development of supported catalysts with well&#8208;defined pore structures and good compatibility to achieve high catalytic activity and product performance. Herein, we report the use of an emergent class of porous material &#8208;&#8208; covalent organic framework material (COF) as a carrier to support metallocene catalyst &#8208;&#8208; Cp2ZrCl2 for ethylene polymerization. The COF&#8208;supported catalyst demonstrates a higher catalytic activity of 31.1 &#215; 106 g/(mol&#183;h) at 140 &#176;C, compared with 11.2 &#215; 106 g/(mol&#183;h) of the homogenous one. The resulting polyethylene (PE) products possess higher weight&#8208;average molecular weight (Mw) and narrower molecular weight distribution (&#393;) after COF supporting, i.e., Mw increases from 160 kDa to 308 kDa and &#393; reduces from 3.3 to 2.2. The melting point (Tm) is also increased by up to 5.2 &#176;C. Moreover, the PE product possesses a characteristic filamentous microstructure and demonstrates an increased tensile strength from 19.0 MPa to 30.7 MPa and elongation at break from 350% to 1400% after catalyst loading. We believe that the use of COF carriers will facilitate the future development of supported catalysts for high&#8208;efficient olefin polymerization and high&#8208;performance polyolefins.</dc:description>

         <title>A 2,2&#8208;Difluoroimidazolidine Derivative for Deoxyfluorination Reactions: Mechanistic Insights by Experimental and Computational Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A N&#8208;heterocyclic deoxyfluorinating agent SIMesF2 was synthesized by nucleophilic fluorination of N,N&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimesityl&#8208;2&#8208;chloroimidazolidinium&#160;chloride&#160;(3) at room temperature. SIMesF2 was applied to deoxyfluorinate carboxylic acids and alcohols and convert benzaldehyde into difluorotoluene. Mechanistic studies by NMR spectroscopy suggest reaction pathways of the carboxylic acid to acyl fluoride via outer&#8208;sphere fluorinations at an imidazolidinium ion by polyfluoride. DFT studies give further insight by exploring mechanistic details which distinguish the fluorination of aldehydes from that of carboxylic acids. Furthermore, a consecutive reaction sequence for the oxidation of an aldehyde followed by in situ fluorination the generated carboxylic acid was developed.</dc:description>

         <title>Materials for Electrochemiluminescence: TADF, Hydrogen&#8208;bonding, and Aggregation&#8208; and Crystallization&#8208;Induced Emission Luminophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is a rapidly growing discipline with many analytical applications from immunoassays to single molecule detection. At the forefront of ECL research is materials chemistry which looks at engineering new materials and compounds exhibiting enhanced ECL efficiencies compared to conventional fluorescent materials. In this minireview, we summarize recent molecular design strategies that lead to high efficiency ECL. In particular, we feature recent advances in the use of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters to produce enhanced electrochemiluminescence. We also document how hydrogen&#8208;bonding, aggregation, and crystallization can each be recruited in the design of materials showing enhanced electrochemiluminescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Chirality Transfer to the Bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide Anion of an Ionic Liquid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality transfer from the chiral molecule (R)&#8208;1,2&#8208;propylene oxide to the achiral anion of the 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ionic liquid is observed. The chiral probe selectively affects only one part of the binary ionic liquid, i.e., it has been shown before experimentally and theoretically that the particular imidazolium cation can be affected by chirality transfer, but in the present system chirality is only transferred to the anion and not to both parts of the solvent (anion and cation). This observation is of high relevance because of its selectivity and because anion effects are usually much more important in ionic liquid research than cation effects. From ab initio&#160;molecular dynamics simulations, a conformational analysis and dissected vibrational circular dichroism spectra are obtained to study the chirality transfer. While in the neat ionic liquid two mirror imaged trans&#160;conformers of the anion occur almost equally, we observe an excess of one of these conformers in the presence of the chiral solute, causing optical activity of the anion. Although, the cis&#160;conformers are not tremendously affected by the chirality transfer, they gain in total population when (R)&#8208;1,2&#8208;propylene oxide is dissolved in the ionic liquid.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Expansion of Cyclohepta[def]fluorene towards Azulene&#8208;embedded Non&#8208;benzenoid Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;benzenoid non&#8208;alternant nanographenes (NGs) have attracted increasing attention on account of their distinct electronic and structural features in comparison to their isomeric benzenoid counterparts. In this work, we present a series of unprecedented azulene&#8208;embedded NGs on Au(111) during the attempted synthesis of cyclohepta[def]fluorene&#8208;based high&#8208;spin non&#8208;Kekul&#233; structure. Comprehensive scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM) evidence structures and conformations of these unexpected products. The dynamics of the precursor bearing 9&#8208;(2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl)anthracene and dihydro&#8208;dibenzo&#8208;cyclohepta[def]fluorene units and its reaction products on the surface are analyzed by density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our study sheds light on the fundamental understanding of precursor design towards the fabrication of &#960;&#8208;extended non&#8208;benzenoid NGs on a metal surface.</dc:description>

         <title>2&#8208;Benzamide Tellurenyl Iodides: Synthesis and Their Catalytic Role in CO2 Mitigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzamide&#8208;derived organochalcogens (chalcogen = S, Se, and Te) have shown promising interest in biological and synthetic chemistry. Ebselen molecule derived from benzamide moiety is the most studied organoselenium. However, its heavier congener organotellurium is under&#8208;explored. Here, an efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed atom economical synthetic method has been developed to synthesize 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;benzamide tellurenyl iodides by inserting a tellurium atom into carbon&#8208;iodine bond of 2&#8208;iodobenzamides in one pot with 78&#8208;95% yields. Further, the Lewis acidic nature of Te center and Lewis basic nature of nitrogen of the synthesized 2&#8208;Iodo&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzamide tellurenyl iodides enabled them as pre&#8208;catalyst for the activation of epoxide with CO2 at 1 atm for the preparation of cyclic carbonates with TOF and TON values of 1447 h&#8208;1 and 4343, respectively, under solvent&#8208;free conditions. In addition, 2&#8208;iodo&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzamide tellurenyl iodides have also been used as pre&#8208;catalyst for activating anilines and CO2 to form a variety of 1,3&#8208;diaryl ureas up to 95% yield. The mechanistic investigation for CO2 mitigation is done by 125Te NMR and HRMS studies. It seems that the reaction proceeds via formation of catalytically active Te&#8208;N heterocycle, an ebtellur intermediate which is isolated and structurally characterized.</dc:description>

This reactivity can be extended to compounds with two azide functional groups such as 1,3&#8208;diazidobenzene. We go on to show that the resulting metallo&#8208;triazaphospholes can be used as precursors to carbon&#8208;functionalized species, including protio&#8208; and iodo&#8208;triazaphospholes.</dc:description>

         <title>The Oxidation of Oxygen and Sulfur&#8208;Containing Heterocycles by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily of monooxygenase enzymes play important roles in the metabolism of molecules which contain heterocyclic, aromatic functional groups. Here we study how oxygen&#8208; and sulfur&#8208;containing heterocyclic groups interact with and are oxidized using the bacterial enzyme CYP199A4. This enzyme oxidized both 4&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzoic acid and 4&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)benzoic acid almost exclusively via sulfoxidation. The thiophene oxides produced were activated towards Diels&#8208;Alder dimerization after sulfoxidation, forming dimeric metabolites. Despite X&#8208;ray crystal structures demonstrating that the aromatic carbon atoms of the thiophene ring were located closer to the heme than the sulfur, sulfoxidation was still favoured with 4&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)benzoic acid. These results highlight a preference of this cytochrome P450 enzyme for sulfoxidation over aromatic hydroxylation. Calculations predict a strong preference for homodimerization of the enantiomers of the thiophene oxides and the formation of a single major product, in broad agreement with the experimental data. 4&#8208;(Furan&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzoic acid was oxidized to 4&#8208;(4'&#8208;hydroxybutanoyl)benzoic acid using a whole&#8208;cell system. This reaction proceeded via a g&#8208;keto&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde species which could be trapped in vitro using semicarbazide to generate a pyridazine species. The combination of the enzyme structures, the biochemical data and theoretical calculations provides detailed insight into the formation of the metabolites formed from these heterocyclic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>SN2 versus E2 Competition of Cyclic Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have quantum chemically studied the influence of ring strain on the competition between the two mechanistically different SN2 and E2 pathways using a series of archetypal ethers as substrate in combination with a diverse set of Lewis bases (F&#8211;, Cl&#8211;, Br&#8211;, HO&#8211;, H3CO&#8211;, HS&#8211;, H3CS&#8211;), using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;OLYP/QZ4P. The ring strain in the substrate is systematically increased on going from a model acyclic ether to a 6&#8208; to 5&#8208; to 4&#8208; to 3&#8208;membered ether ring. We have found that the activation energy of the SN2 pathway sharply decreases when the ring strain of the system is increased, thus on going from large to small cyclic ethers, the SN2 reactivity increases. In contrast, the activation energy of the E2 pathway generally rises along this same series, that is, from large to small cyclic ethers. The opposing reactivity trends induce a mechanistic switch in the preferred reaction pathway for strong Lewis bases from E2, for large cyclic substrates, to SN2, for small cyclic substrates. Weak Lewis bases are unable to overcome the higher intrinsic distortivity of the E2 pathway and, therefore, always favor the less distortive SN2 reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>A Blueprint for the Stabilization of Sub&#8208;Valent Alkaline Earth Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study of sub&#8208;valent Group 2 chemistry is a relatively new research field, being established in 2007 with the report of the first Mg(I) dimers. These species are stabilized by the formation of a Mg&#8211;Mg covalent bond; however, the extension of this chemistry to heavier alkaline earth (AE) metals has been frustrated by significant synthetic challenges, primarily associated with the instability of heavy AE&#8211;AE interactions. Here we present a new blueprint for the stabilization of heavy AE(I) complexes, based upon the reduction of AE(II) precursors with planar coordination geometries. We report the synthesis and structural characterisation of homoleptic trigonal planar AE(II) complexes of the monodentate amides {N(SiMe3)2}&#8211; and {N(Mes)(SiMe3)}&#8211;. DFT calculations showed that the LUMOs of these complexes all show some d&#8208;character for AE = Ca&#8208;Ba. DFT analysis of the square planar Sr(II) complex [Sr{N(SiMe3)2}(dioxane)2]&#8734; revealed analogous frontier orbital d&#8208;character. AE(I) complexes that could be accessed by reduction of these AE(II) precursors were modelled computationally, revealing exergonic formation in all cases. Crucially, NBO calculations show that some d&#8208;character is preserved in the SOMO of theoretical AE(I) products upon reduction, showing that d&#8208;orbitals could play a crucial role in achieving stable heavy AE(I) complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity of [AuF3(SIMes)] &#8211; Pathway to Unprecedented Structural Motifs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on a comprehensive reactivity study starting from [AuF3(SIMes)] to synthesize different motifs of monomeric gold(III) fluorides. A plethora of different ligands has been introduced in a mono&#8208;substitution yielding trans&#8208;[AuF2X(SIMes)] including alkynido, cyanido, azido, and a set of perfluoroalkoxido complexes. The latter were better accomplished via use of perfluorinated carbonyl&#8208;bearing molecules, which is unprecedented in gold chemistry. In case of the cyanide and azide, triple substitution gave rise to the corresponding [AuX3(SIMes)] complexes. Comparison of the chemical shift of the carbene carbon atom in the 13C{1H} NMR spectrum, the calculated SIMes affinity and the Au&#8211;C bond length in the solid state with related literature&#8208;known complexes yields a classification of trans&#8208;influences for a variety of ligands attached to the gold center. Therein, the mixed fluorido perfluoroalkoxido complexes have a similar SIMes affinity to AuF3 with a very low Gibbs energy of formation when using the perfluoro carbonyl route.</dc:description>

         <title>Infrared Spectroscopic and Theoretical Investigations of Group 13 Oxyfluorides OMF2 and OMF (M = B, Al, Ga, In)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Group 13 oxyfluorides OMF2 were produced by the reactions of laser&#8208;ablated group 13 atoms M (M = B, Al, Ga and In) with OF2 and isolated in excess neon or argon matrices at 5 K. These molecules were characterized by matrix&#8208;isolation infrared spectroscopy and isotopic substitution experiments in conjunction with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The calculations indicate that the OMF2 molecules have a 2B2 ground state with C2v symmetry. The computed molecular orbitals and spin densities show that the unpaired electron is mainly located at the terminal oxygen atom. Oxo monofluorides OMF were only observed in solid argon matrices and exhibit a linear structure in the singlet ground state. The M&#8722;O bonding in the OMF molecules can be rationalized as highly polar multiple bonds based on the calculated bond lengths and natural resonance theory (NRT) analyses. In particular, the molecular orbitals of OBF exhibit the character of a triple bond B&#8722;O resulting from two degenerate electron&#8208;sharing &#960; bonds and a O &#8594; B dative &#963; bond formed by the oxygen 2p lone pair which donates electron density to the boron empty 2p orbital.</dc:description>

         <title>Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based AIE Supramolecular Polymer Networks Exhibiting Various Fluorescence to Achieve Visible Surveillance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is significant to achieve visual surveillance of the formation process for supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs). A special AIEgen was introduced into SPNs constructed by host&#8211;guest recognition between pillar[5]arene and pyridine salt. With rising cross&#8208;linking degree, the fluorescence color changes from blue to green due to the gradual aggregated AIEgen, enabling the formation process becoming visually.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs) based on pillar[n]arene are widely studied and it is known that evolution from linear polymers to SPNs occurs as a progressive process, which is of importance to monitor the detailed morphology throughout the process. Yet, the current reports related to that distinction by employing fluorescence approach have realized confined success, it still remains a challenge to distinguish the various states visually. Herein, a fluorescent group of the pyrene benzohydrazonate&#8208;based (PBHZ&#8208;based) derivative is introduced into the pillar[5]arene based SPNs gained from host&#8211;guest recognition, enabling the visual monitoring during the formation of SPNs. The whole visual detection was based on the fluorescence color transition ranging from blue to green relying on the gradual aggregated PBHZ molecules upon the increasing cross&#8208;linking degree. Besides, the stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of this SPNs was confirmed that increasing the temperature or adding a reducing agent would reduce the cross&#8208;linking degree.

         <title>Fully Conjugated Benzyne&#8208;Derived Three&#8208;Dimensional Porous Organic Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of a 3D porous organic polymer starting from a simple 0D bistriflate precursor via in&#8197;situ CsF catalyzed formation of benzyne. This is the first demonstration of 3D polymer being prepared from a single and simple precursor. The resulting benzyne&#8208;derived porous organic polymer showed 544&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 surface area and IAST CO2/N2 selectivity of 65.4







Abstract
Porous organic polymers (POPs) have gained tremendous attention owing to their chemical tunability, stability and high surface areas. Whereas there are several examples of fully conjugated two&#8208;dimensional (2D) POPs, three&#8208;dimensional (3D) ones are rather challenging to realize in the absence of structural templates. Herein, we report the base&#8208;catalyzed direct synthesis of a fully conjugated 3D POPs, named benzyne&#8208;derived polymers (BDPs), containing biphenylene and tetraphenylene moieties starting from a simple bisbenzyne precursor, which undergoes [2+2] and [2+2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions to form BDPs primarily composed of biphenylene and tetraphenylene moieties. The resulting polymers exhibited ultramicroporous structures with surface areas up to 544&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and very high CO2/N2 selectivities.

Towards heterocyclic diversity: A highly diastereoselective organocatalyzed domino vinylogous sulfa&#8208;Michael&#8208;aldol&#8208;cyclocondensation (VMAC) reaction has been developed using alkylidene Meldrum's acid as dienes highlighting two vinylogous steps, namely an unprecedented sulfa&#8208;1,6&#8208;conjugate addition and a diastereoselective aldol reaction triggering a formal (4+2) cycloaddition, which opens a new route to bio&#8208;relevant and original tricyclic thiochroman derivatives.

         <title>Substituted meta[n]Cycloparaphenylenes: Synthesis, Photophysical Properties and Host&#8211;guest Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different sized cyano&#8208;meta[n]cycloparaphenylenes (CN&#8208;m[n]CPPs) have been prepared for investigation of their photophysical properties. Furthermore, CN&#8208;m[6]CPP served as key substrate to demonstrate the versatility of the nitrile functionality and therefore a general concept towards functionalized m[n]CPPs was developed. Additionally, CN&#8208;m[10]CPP was used to report the first association constant of a m[10]CPP with fullerene C60.







Abstract
Breaking the centrosymmetry of [n]cycloparaphenylenes ([n]CPPs) by one meta connection, leads to bright emission in the typically non&#8208;fluorescent smaller derivatives, conserving their size dependent emissive properties. Using the building block strategy for [n]CPPs, different nitrile substituted meta[n]CPPs (n=6, 8, 10) have been prepared. The nitrile substituent offers a convenient handle for functional group conversions (e.g., carboxylic acid, amide, aldehyde, as well as 1H&#8208;tetrazole). Besides the synthetic work, the photophysical properties of these novel m[n]CPP derivatives have been characterized. Additionally, the host&#8211;guest ability of cyano&#8208;m[10]CPP has been explored by studying its complexation with fullerene C60. These insights open new applications of meta[n]CPPs as fluorophore in synthetic organic chemistry, material sciences as well as biomedical research.

         <title>Reexamining the Emergence and Stability of the Square Cylinder Phase in Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transition from the square cylinder phase to the rectangular cylinder phase is a second&#8208;order transition that accompanies the transition of the free&#8208;energy landscape from one minimum to two minima. The prolate contour lines of the free&#8208;energy landscape indicate the weak stability of the square phase in the 
 copolymer.







Abstract
Recently, a few AB&#8208;type multiblock copolymers have been successfully designed to form stable square cylinder phase based on self&#8208;consistent field theory (SCFT) calculations. The previous works only identify the stability region of the square phase but not analyzing its stability, which is closely related to the free&#8208;energy landscape. In this work, we have reexamined the stability of the square phase in 
 linear pentablock and 
 star triblock copolymers by drawing the free&#8208;energy landscape with respect to the two dimensions of a rectangular unit cell. Our results demonstrate that the square phase continuously transfers to the rectangular phase as the degree of packing frustration is gradually released. Moreover, the prolate contour lines of the free&#8208;energy landscape indicate the weak stability of the square phase in the 
 copolymer. In contrast, the stability of the square phase is notably improved in the 
 copolymer due to its enhanced concentration of bridging configurations. Our work sheds light on the understanding of the stability of the square cylinder phase in block copolymers.

     alt="Reexamining the Emergence and Stability of the Square Cylinder Phase in Block Copolymers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition from the square cylinder phase to the rectangular cylinder phase is a second-order transition that accompanies the transition of the free-energy landscape from one minimum to two minima. The prolate contour lines of the free-energy landscape indicate the weak stability of the square phase in the 
 copolymer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, a few AB-type multiblock copolymers have been successfully designed to form stable square cylinder phase based on self-consistent field theory (SCFT) calculations. The previous works only identify the stability region of the square phase but not analyzing its stability, which is closely related to the free-energy landscape. In this work, we have reexamined the stability of the square phase in 
 linear pentablock and 
 star triblock copolymers by drawing the free-energy landscape with respect to the two dimensions of a rectangular unit cell. Our results demonstrate that the square phase continuously transfers to the rectangular phase as the degree of packing frustration is gradually released. Moreover, the prolate contour lines of the free-energy landscape indicate the weak stability of the square phase in the 
 copolymer. In contrast, the stability of the square phase is notably improved in the 
 copolymer due to its enhanced concentration of bridging configurations. Our work sheds light on the understanding of the stability of the square cylinder phase in block copolymers. Accordingly, we propose some possible strategies for further designing new AB-type block copolymer systems to obtain more stable square phase.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polymer Nanoantidotes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer nanoantidotes implement the detoxification process through three different patterns, physical interaction, chemical bonding, and biomimetic clearance, and their significant efficacy speculates on the opportunities for clinical application.







Abstract
Intoxication is one of the most common causes of accidental death globally. Although some antidotes capable of neutralizing the toxicity of certain xenobiotics have become well established, the current reality is that clinicians primarily rely on nonspecific extracorporeal techniques to remove toxins. Nano&#8208;intervention strategies in which nanoantidotes neutralize toxicity in&#8197;situ via physical interaction, chemical bonding, or biomimetic clearance have begun to show clinical potential. However, most nanoantidotes remain in the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept stage, and the difficulty of constructing clinical relevance models and the unclear pharmacokinetics of nanoantidotes hinder their translation to clinic. This Concept reviews the detoxification mechanisms of polymer nanoantidotes and predicts the opportunities and challenges associated with their clinical application.

         <title>Fast Visualized Conformational Transition of Polyphenylacetylenes with Stepwise Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel thermoresponsive polyphenylacetylene shows reversible conformation transition, fluorescent and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switch. The conformational transition could be read out via the change of visible fluorescence signals. Moreover, the polymers displayed switchable CPL performance and the luminescent dissymmetry factor could be stepwise amplified by forming chiral aggregates or liquid crystalline structure.







Abstract
Two novel poly(3,5&#8208;diamide substituted phenylacetylene)s bearing L&#8208; or D&#8208;alanine residues with a long alkyl chain were synthesized. In low polar or apolar solvents, the polymers adopted contracted cis&#8208;cisoid helix showing strong yellow fluorescence, which was transferred to stretched cis&#8208;transoid helix by adding polar solvents or decreasing temperature, accompanied with the disappearance of fluorescence. The critical conformational transition temperature could be readily tuned in a wide range by altering the content of polar solvent, and the conformational variation at molecular level could be directly read out via the change in fluorescent property. The synergistical participation of amide and ester groups in the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds accelerated the conformational transition rate, resulting in remarkable reduction of hysteresis. Moreover, the polymers displayed switchable CPL performance and the luminescent dissymmetry factor could be stepwise amplified by forming chiral aggregates or liquid crystalline structure. This study may open a new avenue for the development of controllable helical structure&#8208;based smart CPL materials.

         <title>Push&#8208;Pull Bridged Distyrylbenzene with Highly Bright Solid&#8208;State Red&#8208;Orange Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A red&#8208;emitting aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) is realized by introducing a bridging structure into push&#8208;pull distyrylbenzene.







Abstract
Multiple emission colors in solid&#8208;state organic fluorophores with the same main skeleton are essential for improving the performance of light&#8208;emitting devices/materials. Specifically, emission in the red/near&#8208;infrared region is of great importance in the biological field. Previously, we developed di&#8208;bridged&#8208;distyrylbenzene DBDB[7] with high&#8208;brightness solid&#8208;state blue and aggregation&#8208;induced emissions (AIE) by introducing the bridging structures of a seven&#8208;membered ring into the vinylene groups of distyrylbenzene (DSB). Herein, we synthesize MNDBDMeODB[7] (1), which features substituted methoxy and malononitrile groups as donor and acceptor groups, respectively, in DBDB[7]. In solvents more polar than THF, MNDSDMeOB (3), which has the same main skeleton as 1 but without bridges, shows no emission in the solid state, whereas 1 exhibits highly bright red&#8208;orange emission in the solid state owing to the suppression of intermolecular electronic interactions by the bridges and the AIE property. We also synthesize MNDSD(EHO)B (2) in which the methoxy groups of 3 are replaced by ethylhexyloxy groups, thus disrupting the crystallinity of the molecule. 2 exhibits positive fluorescence solvatochromism and has a high fluorescence quantum yield in the solid state as a red&#8208;emitting DSB derivative. The solid&#8208;state emission properties of 1 and 2 will improve the applicability of DSBs and functionalities of light&#8208;emitting devices/materials.

         <title>London Dispersion Effects on the Stability of Heavy Tetrel Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A review on the most recent findings of dispersion energy donor (DED) ligands and their effects on the stabilization of heavier group&#8197;14 elements is presented. We specifically discuss DED ligand effects on the structures and reactivities of diplumbynes, distannenes and cyclotristannanes.







Abstract
London dispersion (LD) interactions, which stem from long&#8208;range electron correlations arising from instantaneously induced dipoles can occur between neighboring atoms or molecules, for example, between H atoms within ligand C&#8722;H groups. These interactions are currently of interest as a new method of stabilizing long bonds and species with unusual oxidation states. They can also limit reactivity by installing LD enhanced groups into organic frameworks or ligand substituents. Here, we address the most recent advances in the design of LD enhanced ligands, the sterically counterintuitive structures that can be generated and the consequences that these interactions can have on the structures and reactivity of sterically crowded heavy group&#8197;14 species.

         <title>A Mild Synthesis of Aryl Triflates Enabling the Late&#8208;Stage Modification of Drug Analogs and Complex Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a highly convenient strategy to convert phenols into the corresponding aryl triflates using a newly discovered reagent in presence of a fluoride source. The reactions are generally complete within a few minutes at room temperature. The mild conditions allow the late&#8208;stage O&#8208;triflation of complex peptides bearing challenging side chains like arginine and histidine. We show that aryl triflates can be an interesting moiety for medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
We report the discovery of a straightforward protocol to convert phenols into the corresponding aryl triflates using 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;one in the presence of a fluoride source. This novel reagent can be handled without any precautions to exclude air or moisture making this method highly convenient. The reactions generally show very clean conversions within only a few minutes at room temperature. The mild conditions allow the so far unprecedented O&#8208;triflation of tyrosine in peptides bearing challenging side chains present for example in arginine and histidine including the late&#8208;stage triflation of complex bioactive peptides. We show how aryl triflates &#8211; an interesting but so far underutilized group &#8211; can be used to optimize physicochemical and in&#8197;vitro properties of compound series in medicinal chemistry. We believe that this method is highly attractive for applications in peptide functionalization as well as automated and medicinal chemistry.

We believe that this method is highly attractive for applications in peptide functionalization as well as automated and medicinal chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Photodynamic Activity of Tetrakis(4&#8208;Aminophenyl)Porphyrins with and without Acetyl Protecting Groups on Cancer and Normal Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)porphyrin (1) and tetrakis(4&#8208;acetamidophenyl)porphyrin (2) were dissolved in water with the incorporation of a polysaccharide (&#955;&#8208;carrageenan (CGN)) as a water&#8208;solubilizing agent. Although the photodynamic activity of the CGN&#8208;2 complex was considerably lower than that of the CGN&#8208;1 complex, the selectivity index (SI; IC50 in a normal cell/IC50 in a cancer cell) of the CGN&#8208;2 complex was considerably higher than that of the CGN&#8208;1 complex. This is because the photodynamic activity of the CGN&#8208;2 complex was significantly affected by the intracellular uptakes by the normal and cancer cells. During in vivo experiments, the CGN&#8208;2 complex inhibited tumor growth under light irradiation with high blood retention compared with the CGN&#8208;1 complex and Photofrin, which exhibited lower blood retention. This study showed that the photodynamic activity and SI are influenced by substituent groups of arene in the meso&#8208;positions of porphyrin analogs.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Chemistry and Specific Surface Area rule the Efficiency of Gold Nanoparticle Sensitizers in Proton Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are known radiosensitizers in proton therapy (PT) applicable for the treatment of solid tumors, where they amplify production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, it is underexplored how this amplification is correlated with the AuNPs&#180; surface chemistry. To clarify this issue, we fabricated ligand&#8208;free AuNPs of different mean diameters by laser ablation in liquids (LAL) and laser fragmentation in liquids (LFL) and irradiated them with clinically relevant proton fields using water phantoms. ROS generation was monitored by the fluorescent dye 7&#8208;OH&#8208;coumarin. Our findings reveal an enhancement of ROS production driven by I) increased total particle surface area, II) utilization of ligand&#8208;free AuNPs avoiding sodium citrate as a radical quencher ligands, and III) a higher density of structural defects generated by LFL synthesis, indicated by surface charge density. Based on these findings it may be concluded that the surface chemistry is a major and underexplored contributor to ROS generation and sensitizing effects of AuNPs in PT. We further highlight the applicability of AuNPs in vitro in human medulloblastoma cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Factors Controlling Complex Morphologies of Isomorphous Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate here how nitrate salts of bivalent copper, nickel, cobalt, and manganese, along with an achiral organic ligand, assemble into various structures such as symmetrical double&#8208;decker flowers, smooth elongated hexagonal bipyramids, and hexagonal prisms. Large morphological changes occur in these structures because of different metal cations, although they maintain isomorphous hexagonal crystallographic structures. Metal cations with stronger coordination to ligands (Cu,&#160;Ni) tend to form uniform crystals with unusual shapes, whereas weaker coordinating metal cations (Mn,&#160;Co) produce crystals with more regular hexagonal morphologies.&#160; The unusual flower&#8208;like crystals formed with copper nitrate have two pairs of six symmetrical petals with hexagonal convex centers. The texture of the petals indicates dendritic growth. Two different types of morphologies were formed by using different copper nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratios. An excess of the metal salt results in uniform and monodisperse hexagonal crystals, whereas the use of an excess of ligand results in double&#8208;decker morphologies. Mechanistically, an intermediate structure was observed with slightly concave facets and a domed center. Such structures&#160;likely play a key role in the formation of double&#8208;decker crystals that can be formed by fusion processes. The coordination chemistry results in isostructural chiral frameworks consisting of two types of continuous helical channels.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Catalyst Deuteration on the Reactivity of Chiral Phase&#8208;Transfer Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;specifically deuterated organocatalysts were prepared and found to show improved reactivity over the non&#8208;deuterated analogs. Two privileged C2&#8208;symmetric chiral binaphthyl&#8208;modified tetraalkylammonium salts were selected for this study. The stability of these phase&#8208;transfer catalysts was generally improved by site&#8208;specific deuteration, though the degree of improvement was structure&#8208;dependent. In particular, a large secondary kinetic isotope effect was observed for the tetradeuterated phase&#8208;transfer catalyst. The performance of these deuterated catalysts in the asymmetric catalytic alkylation of amino acid derivatives was better than that of non&#8208;deuterated analogs at low catalyst loadings. The results suggest that catalyst&#8208;deuteration is a promising strategy for enhancing the stability and performance of organocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Formation of CoP/Co3O4 Heterojunction for Efficient Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical water splitting is an environmentally friendly and effective energy storage method. However, it is still a huge challenge for preparing no&#8208;noble metal based&#8208;electrocatalysts which possess high activity and long&#8208;term durability to realize efficient water splitting. Here, we put forward a novel method of low&#8208;temperature phosphating to prepare CoP/Co3O4 heterojunction nanowires catalyst on titanium mesh (TM) substrate for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and overall water splitting. CoP/Co3O4@TM heterojunction showed an excellent catalytic performance and long&#8208;term durability in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. The overpotential of CoP/Co3O4@TM heterojunction was only 257 mV at 20 mA cm&#8208;2 during the OER process, and it could work stably more than 40 h at 1.52 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE). During the HER process, the overpotential of CoP/Co3O4@TM heterojunction was only 107 mV at &#8208;10 mA cm&#8208;2. &#160;More importantly, when CoP/Co3O4@TM heterojunction were used as anodic and cathodic electrocatalysts, respectively, they displayed 10 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.59 V. The Faradaic efficiencies of OER and HER were 98.4% and 99.4%, respectively. It was more excellent than the Ru/Ir&#8208;based noble metal electrocatalysts and other non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts which have been reported for overall water splitting.</dc:description>

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Evaluation of Biological Activity of Ferrocene&#8208;Ispinesib Hybrids &#8208; Impact of a Ferrocenyl Group on the Antiproliferative and KSP Inhibitory Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the aim to combine more than one biologically&#8208;active component in a single molecule, derivatives of ispinesib and its (S) analogue were prepared that featured ferrocenyl moieties or bulky organic substituents. Inspired by the strong kinesin spindle protein (KSP) inhibitory activity of ispinesib, the compounds were investigated for their antiproliferative activity. Among these compounds, several derivatives demonstrated significantly higher antiproliferative activity than ispinesib with nanomolar IC50&#160;values against cell lines. Further evaluation indicated that the antiproliferative activity is not directly correlated with their KSP inhibitory activity while docking suggested that several of the derivatives may bind in a manner similar to ispinesib. In order to investigate the mode of action further, cell cycle analysis and reactive oxygen species formation were investigated. The improved antiproliferative activity of the most active compounds may be assigned to synergic effect of various factors such as KPS inhibitory activity due to ispinesibe&#8208;core and ability to generate ROS and induce mitotic arrest.</dc:description>

         <title>Modified Peptide Molecules As Potential Modulators of Shelterin Protein Functions; TRF1</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we present studies on relatively new and still not well&#8208;explored potential anticancer targets which are shelterin proteins, in particular the TRF1 protein can be blocked by in silico designed "peptidomimetic" molecules. TRF1 interacts directly with the TIN2 protein, and this protein&#8208;protein interaction is crucial for the proper functioning of telomere, which could be blocked by our novel modified peptide molecules. Our chemotherapeutic approach is based on assumption that modulation of TRF1&#8208;TIN2 interaction may be more harmful for cancer cells as cancer telomeres are more fragile than in normal cells. We have shown in vitro within SPR experiments that our modified peptide PEP1 molecule interacts with TRF1, presumably at the site originally occupied by the TIN2 protein. Disturbance of the shelterin complex by studied molecule may not in short term lead to cytotoxic effects, however blocking TRF1&#8208;TIN2 resulted in cellular senescence in cellular breast cancer lines used as a cancer model. Thus, our compounds appeared useful as starting model compounds for precise blockage of TRF proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Oriented External Electric Field Effects on the Activation of Aryl CO Bond in Anisole using Rh(PEP) (E=Al, B, Ga) Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present work reports a DFT&#8208;based mechanistic investigation of aryl C&#8208;O bond activation in anisole catalysed by a Rh&#8208;Al pincer&#8208;type complex at room temperature. The study is extended to analogues Rh&#8208;E complexes based on group 13 elements (E=B/Ga). Our results show a preference for the heterolytic cleavage pathway over oxidative addition in the C&#8208;O bond activation. The calculated barriers range from 16 to 36 kcal/mol, following the order: E=Al &lt; E=Ga &lt; E=B. We observed a strong correlation between the activation barriers and the local electric field (LEF) at the Rh metal centre for the studied Rh&#8208;E complexes. Additionally, we examined the ability of Oriented External Electric Fields (OEEF) to lower the reaction barrier by applying the OEEF along the direction of electron reorganization, i.e., &#8220;the reaction axis&#8221;. Our results demonstrate the significant effect of applied OEEF on the aryl C&#8208;O bond activation in Rh&#8208;E systems. Furthermore, we showcase the effect of OEEF on the C&#8208;O bond activation using modified Rh&#8208;E (E=B, Al, or Ga) complexes, where electronic structure modifications enable a more efficient barrier control by the OEEF. Notably, applying a moderate field strength reduces the high reaction barrier for the Rh&#8208;B system by ~13 kcal/mol.</dc:description>

         <title>A Doubly Dissipative System Driven by Chemical and Radiative Stimuli</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The operation of a dissipative network composed of two or three different crown&#8208;ether receptors and an alkali metal cation can be temporally driven by the use (combined or not) of two orthogonal stimuli of different nature. More specifically, irradiation with light at a proper wavelength and/or addition of an activated carboxylic acid, are used to modulate the binding capability of the above crown&#8208;ethers towards the metal ion, allowing to control over time the occupancy of the metal cation in the crown&#8208;ether moiety of a given ligand. Thus, application of either or both of the stimuli to an initially equilibrated system, where the metal cation is distributed among the crown&#8208;ether receptors depending on the different affinities, causes a programmable change in the receptor occupancies. Consequently, the system is induced to evolve to one or more out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium states with different distributions of the metal cation among the different receptors. When the fuel is exhausted or/and the irradiation interrupted, the system reversibly and autonomously goes back to the initial equilibrium state. Such results may contribute to the achievement of new dissipative systems that, taking advantage of multiple and orthogonal stimuli, are featured with more sophisticated operating mechanisms and time programmability.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu2P7&#8208;CoP Heterostructure Nanosheets Enable High&#8208;Performance of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu2P7&#8208;CoP heterostructure nanosheets were designed as the electrocatalyst for conversion of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural into 2, 5&#8208;furanedioic acid, achieving superior electrooxidation performance.







Abstract
Electrooxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfural (HMF) into 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylicacid (FDCA) has been regarded as a promising sustainable approach to achieve value&#8208;added chemicals. However, it is still impeded by the unsatisfactory performance of electrocatalysts. Here, Cu2P7&#8208;CoP heterostructure nanosheets were reported to enable powerful HMF electrooxidation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrooxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfural (HMF) into 2,5-furandicarboxylicacid (FDCA) has been regarded as a promising sustainable approach to achieve value-added chemicals. However, it is still impeded by the unsatisfactory performance of electrocatalysts. Here, Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;-CoP heterostructure nanosheets were reported to enable powerful HMF electrooxidation.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalysts for the Selective 2&#8201;e&#8722; Oxygen Reduction Reaction: A Never&#8208;Ending Story?</title>

         <dc:description>
The exohedral functionalization of carbon nanomaterials with tailored O&#8208;containing groups appears as the long&#8208;sought solution for putting an end to a highly controversial matter within the scientific community: shedding light on the puzzling structure/reactivity relationship in metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for the challenging 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrosynthesis via the 2e&#8722; Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) represents a highly challenging, environmentally friendly and cost&#8208;effective alternative to the current anthraquinone&#8208;based technology. Various lightweight element hetero&#8208;doped carbon nanostructures are promising and cheap metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for H2O2 synthesis, particularly those containing O&#8208;functionalities. The exact role of O&#8208;containing functional groups as electroactive sites for the process remains debated if not highly controversial. Herein, we have reported on the covalent exohedral functionalization of the outer surface of extra&#8208;pure multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with discrete O&#8208;functional groups as a unique approach to prepare selective electrocatalysts for the process. This kind of decoration has added fundamental tiles to the puzzling structure/reactivity relationship of O&#8208;containing carbon&#8208;based catalysts for ORR, clearing doubts on the controversial role of hydroxyl/phenol groups as key functionalities for the design of more performing 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalysts.

         <title>Dipole&#8208;Transmissive 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions for the Rapid Construction of Polycyclic N&#8208;Heterocycles: Synthetic and Mechanistic Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigation into and formalisation of dipole&#8208;transmissive dipolar cycloaddition (DTDC) methodology is reported. By designing substrates bearing complementary azide and diazoalkane 1,3&#8208;dipoles, we were able to employ integrated experimental and theoretical studies to construct a series of polycyclic N&#8208;heterocycles and rationalise the mechanistic basis of the divergent reactivity observed.







Abstract
The investigation of distinctive dipole&#8208;transmissive dipolar cycloaddition (DTDC) methodology and the formalisation of this concept is reported. A DTDC procedure was able to be developed by taking advantage of the structural complementarity of azide and diazoalkane 1,3&#8208;dipoles. Intramolecular azide&#8208;alkene 1,3&#8208;DCs followed by spontaneous dipole transmission upon work&#8208;up furnished intermediate &#945;&#8208;diazoisoindole and &#945;&#8208;diazoisoquinoline substrates bearing the key secondary diazoalkane 1,3&#8208;dipole. N&#8208;Derivatisation of the intermediate &#945;&#8208;diazoisoindole and &#945;&#8208;diazoisoquinolines with a tethered secondary dipolarophile followed by a subsequent 1,3&#8208;DC allowed for rapid construction of a range of functionalised polycyclic N&#8208;heterocycles. Integrated experimental and theoretical studies established requirements for product formation and revealed the likely mechanistic basis of divergent reactivity observed.

Structural isomers of thienoindolizines have been synthesized in a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step procedure starting from easily accessible gem&#8208;difluoroalkene functionalized bromothiophenes.

Abstract
A series of thienoindolizine structural isomers have been synthesized in a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step procedure starting from easily accessible gem&#8208;difluoroalkene functionalized bromothiophenes. The developed method gives easy access to a range of thienoindolizine products containing thieno[3,2&#8208;g]&#8208;, thieno[3,4&#8208;g]&#8208; and thieno[2,3&#8208;g]indolizine core structures. The described synthesis strategy consists of a base mediated, transition metal free nucleophilic substitution of fluorine atoms by nitrogen containing heterocycles followed by a Pd catalyzed intramolecular cyclization. A series of 22 final product examples has been obtained with yields ranging from 29&#8201;% to 95&#8201;%. UV/Vis absorption, fluorescence spectroscopy, fluorescence lifetime measurements and cyclic voltammetry were carried out with selected final products to evaluate structural effects on photophysical and electrochemical properties. (TD)DFT and NICS calculations were performed to provide insight into the electronic properties of the four core molecular structures.

         <title>In Situ Generation of Magnesium&#8208; and Calcium&#8208;Based Grignard Reagents for Amide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amides of magnesium are widely used reagents whereas the calcium congeners remained unappreciated for diverse reasons such as inertness of the metal and side reactions during Grignard&#8208;type applications. Intermediately prepared aryl&#8208; and alkylcalcium reagents, which are immediately consumed via metalation of amines (iGMM) or addition across imines (iGAM) circumvent many difficulties related to organocalcium chemistry.







Abstract
The alkaline&#8208;earth metals Mg and Ca are too inert for the direct metalation of primary and secondary amines. Consequently, activation prior to use is required. Alternatively, the Grignard reagents RMgX (R=alkyl, aryl, X=halide) can be applied in metalation of amines. However, such a straightforward procedure for the synthesis of alkylcalcium reagents is disadvantageous due to diverse side reactions, including Wurtz&#8208;type C&#8722;C coupling and ether degradation reactions. Therefore, suspensions of magnesium or calcium with amine can be treated in a smooth reaction with ethyl bromide in an ethereal solvent at room temperature. Intermediately formed RAeX (Ae=alkaline&#8208;earth metal, i.&#8201;e., Mg, Ca) either metalates amines yielding the corresponding amides in an in&#8197;situ Grignard metalation method (iGMM) or adds across C=N bonds of imines in an in&#8197;situ Grignard addition method (iGAM). The amides R&#8217;2N&#8208;AeX (Ae=Mg: Hauser bases) undergo Schlenk&#8208;type ligand exchange reactions yielding homoleptic Ae(NR&#8217;2)2 and potentially sparingly soluble AeX2.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Morphing Liquid&#8208;Crystal polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shaping up: Liquid&#8208;crystal polymers are considered one of the most promising candidates for intelligent shape&#8208;morphing materials. In this review, we discuss recent developments in energy conversion, design strategies and the applications of shape&#8208;morphing liquid&#8208;crystal polymers.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;crystal polymers are a type of representative material combining the order&#8208;disorder transition of liquid crystals and the superior properties of polymers. The phase transition from the liquid&#8208;crystal phase to the isotropic state of mesogens causes large, controllable, and reversible deformation of polymers; thus, liquid&#8208;crystal polymers have emerged as one of the most valuable candidates for shape&#8208;morphing materials. Therefore, this review will focus on the recent development of shape&#8208;morphing liquid&#8208;crystal polymers, including the modes of energy conversions, material design strategies and further applications. In the main, novel material design methods and a wide range of application of shape&#8208;morphing liquid&#8208;crystal polymers are discussed.

         <title>Synthesis of a Benzotrisazulene via Trioxobenzotrisazulene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benzotrisazulene was synthesized on the basis of a truxene precursor by a series of Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reactions via the intermediate trisoxo compound. The latter occurs in two forms (syn and anti), and the syn forms porous crystals.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) containing odd&#8208;membered rings (such as pentagons or heptagons) are fascinating synthetic targets. A special case is the introduction of five&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered rings in form of an azulene unit. Azulene itself is an aromatic compounds known for its deep blue color, which is a result of its internal dipole moment. When azulene is embedded into PAHs it can change the optoelectronic properties of the PAH significantly. Herein, the synthesis and characterization of a PAH containing three azulene units is reported via reduction and elimination of its trioxo derivative.

         <title>Generation and Characterization of a Tetraradical Embedded in a Curved Cyclic Paraphenylene Unit</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetraradical embedded in a curved cycloparaphenylene skeleton was generated and characterized to examine the reactivity and magnetic interaction of the two diradical units in the bent molecular structure. Ferromagnetic interactions within the diradical unit and antiferromagnetic interaction between the diradical units lead to an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state for the tetraradical.







Abstract
Unique spin&#8211;spin (magnetic) interactions, ring&#8208;size effects on ground&#8208;state spin multiplicity, and in&#8208;plane aromaticity has been found in localized 1,3&#8208;diradicals embedded in curved benzene structures such as cycloparaphenylene (CPP). In this study, we characterized the magnetic interactions in a tetraradical consisting of two localized 1,3&#8208;diradical units connected by p&#8208;quaterphenyl within a curved CPP skeleton by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. Persistent triplet species with zero&#8208;field splitting parameters similar to those of a triplet 1,3&#8208;diphenylcyclopentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyl diradical were observed by continuous wave (CW) or pulsed X&#8208;band EPR measurements. The quintet state derived from the ferromagnetic interaction between the two triplet diradical moieties was not detected at 20&#8197;K under glassy matrix conditions. At the B3LYP/6&#8208;31G(d) level of theory, the singlet state was lower in energy than the triplet and quintet states. These findings will aid in the development of open&#8208;shell species for material science application.

         <title>Micelle&#8208;Mediated Sonogashira Coupling for DNA&#8208;Encoded Library Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A micelle&#8208;mediated Sonogashira reaction between on&#8208;DNA (hetero)aryl iodides or bromides and (hetero)aryl or aliphatic terminal alkynes. The methodology shows broad substrate scope in terms of both coupling partners and we demonstrate that the methodology is fully compatible with library synthesis protocols and DNA encoded and decoding. This methodology will enable the synthesis of alkynyl(hetero)biaryls or it could be used for subsequent derivatization to alternative products, such as the corresponding alkane or heterocycles.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries (DELs) are becoming widely established as a hit identification strategy for drug discovery campaigns. Their successful application relies on the availability and efficiency of the reactions that can be carried out on DNA. These reactions should proceed with high conversion to the desired product and have a broad substrate scope to synthesise chemically diverse and drug&#8208;like DELs. The Sonogashira coupling provides a unique means of coupling an sp&#8208;hybridized carbon centre to an aryl halide and methods to achieve this reaction on DNA are highly desirable. We report the application of our micellar technology for on&#8208;DNA chemistry to the Sonogashira reaction. This method gives highly efficient conversions for the coupling of (hetero)aromatic and aliphatic alkynes to (hetero)aryl iodides and bromides allowing the preparation of highly diverse DELs.

         <title>Highly Chemoselective Zn+2&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrosilylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new dicationic Zn&#8208;based complex was synthesized and found to be a highly selective catalyst for the hydrosilylation of alkynes. Remarkably, this complex could selectively catalyze the hydrosilylation of alkynes even in the presence of alkenes.







Abstract
Hydrosilylation of C=C double and C&#8801;C triple bonds is one of the most widely used processes in organosilicon chemistry, mostly catalyzed by Pt&#8208;based complexes. Herein, the synthesis of a dicationic Zn+2&#8208;based complex with a tripodal tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine (TPA) ligand is reported which was found to be a highly chemoselective catalyst for hydrosilylation reactions of alkynes. Mechanistic studies revealed that unlike typical Zn&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation reactions where the key step is the activation of the Si&#8722;H bond, this system catalyzes the hydrosilylation reaction through the activation of C&#8801;C triple bonds, which presumably is the reason for its high chemoselectivity. Remarkably, the hydrosilylation of alkynes could be performed in the presence of alkenes and other functional groups that remained intact in this reaction.

         <title>Synthesis and Conformational Analysis of Fullerene Torsion Balances for Assessing the Contribution of Dispersion and Anionic Character in Non&#8208;Covalent Arene&#8211;Fullerene Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing torsion balance molecules, we effectively measured the magnitude of the dispersion forces involved in the non&#8208;covalent interactions between substituted arene and fullerene. In addition, our findings indicate that solvation is of paramount importance in the anionic arene&#8211;fullerene interaction between thiophenolate and fullerene.







Abstract
We employ a molecular torsion balance displaying bifurcated conformational isomerism to quantitatively evaluate the non&#8208;covalent interactions between the fullerene surface and substituted arene moieties containing elements with high atomic numbers, as well as the thermodynamic processes involved in the folding equilibrium using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The interaction between fullerene and haloaryl groups was stronger in cases where the introduced halogen had a higher atomic number, indicating that dispersion forces play a significant role in the interaction between fullerenes and 4&#8208;haloaryl groups. The dispersion term also significantly contributed to the interaction between fullerene and the 4&#8208;mercaptophenyl group. Moreover, the addition of an appropriate base to the 4&#8208;mercaptophenyl&#8208;appended torsion balance formed the corresponding thiophenolate anion, resulting in a large negative change in the folding free energy in CDCl3. Detailed analysis suggested that the observed attractive anionic arene&#8211;fullerene interactions predominantly originated from solvation effects.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We employ a molecular torsion balance displaying bifurcated conformational isomerism to quantitatively evaluate the non-covalent interactions between the fullerene surface and substituted arene moieties containing elements with high atomic numbers, as well as the thermodynamic processes involved in the folding equilibrium using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The interaction between fullerene and haloaryl groups was stronger in cases where the introduced halogen had a higher atomic number, indicating that dispersion forces play a significant role in the interaction between fullerenes and 4-haloaryl groups. The dispersion term also significantly contributed to the interaction between fullerene and the 4-mercaptophenyl group. Moreover, the addition of an appropriate base to the 4-mercaptophenyl-appended torsion balance formed the corresponding thiophenolate anion, resulting in a large negative change in the folding free energy in CDCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Detailed analysis suggested that the observed attractive anionic arene&#8211;fullerene interactions predominantly originated from solvation effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Editing Enhances Oxidation Resistance of Mena&#8208;quinone&#8208;Targeting Antibiotics Lysocin E and WAP&#8208;8294A2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lysocin E (1a) and WAP&#8208;8294A2 (2a) are peptidic natural products with 37&#8208; and 40&#8208;membered macrocycles, respectively. Compounds 1a and 2a have potent antibacterial activities against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria and share a unique mode of action. The electron&#8208;rich indole ring of d&#8208;Trp&#8208;10 of 1a and 2a interacts with the electron&#8208;deficient benzoquinone ring of menaquinone, which is a co&#8208;enzyme in the bacterial respiratory chain. Formation of the electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor complex causes membrane disruption, leading to cell death. Despite the promising activities of 1a and 2a, the susceptibility of Trp&#8208;10 to oxidative degradation potentially deters the development of these compounds as antibacterial drugs. To address this issue, we replaced the indole ring with more oxidation&#8208;resistant aromatics having a similar shape and electron&#8208;rich character. Specifically, analogues with benzofuran (1b/2b), benzothiophene (1c/2c), and 1&#8208;naphthalene (1d/2d) rings were designed, and chemically prepared by full solid&#8208;phase total syntheses. Antibacterial assays of the six analogues revealed similar activities of 1d/2d and markedly reduced activities of 1b/2b and 1c/2c compared with 1a/2a. Equipotent 1d and 2d both showed high resistance to oxidation by peroxyl radicals. Hence, the present study demonstrates a new molecular editing strategy for conferring oxidation stability on natural products with pharmacologically useful functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Shape Transformation via Etching and Regrowth: A Systematic Study of Pd Nanocrystals with Different Shapes and Twin Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article describes a systematic study of the oxidative etching and regrowth behaviors of Pd nanocrystals, including single&#8208;crystal cubes bounded by {100} facets,&#160;single&#8208;crystal&#160;octahedra and tetrahedra enclosed by {111} facets; and multiple&#8208;twinned icosahedra covered by {111} facets. During etching, Pd atoms are preferentially oxidized and removed from the corners regardless of the type of nanocrystal, and the resultant Pd2+ ions are then reduced back to elemental Pd. For cubes and icosahedra, the newly formed Pd atoms are deposited on the {100} facets and twin boundaries, respectively, due to their relatively higher energies. For octahedra and tetrahedra, the Pd atoms self&#8208;nucleate in the solution phase, followed by their growth into small particles. We can control the etching rate relative to regrowth by varying the concentration of HCl in the reaction solution. As the concentration of HCl increases, 18&#8208;nm Pd cubes converted to&#160;octahedra of 23, 18, and 13 nm, respectively, in edge length. Due to the absence of regrowth, however, Pd octahedra are transformed into truncated octahedra, cuboctahedra, and spheres with decreasing sizes whereas Pd tetrahedra evolved into truncated tetrahedra and spheres. In contrast, Pd icosahedra with twin boundaries on the surface converted to asymmetric icosahedra, flower&#8208;like icosahedra, and spheres.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Visible Light Photocatalysis with Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of merging visible light photocatalysis and organocatalysis has been utilized and applied in a wide range of reactions. This review summarized the latest advances in the field of cooperative catalysis by the combination of organocatalysis and photocatalysis in recent organic synthesis.







Abstract
In recent years, the strategy of merging visible light photocatalysis and organocatalysis has been utilized and applied in a wide range of reactions. Taking advantage of synergistic visible light photocatalysis with organocatalysis, remarkable progress has recently been achieved in modern chemical synthesis. In these dual catalytic systems, photocatalysts or photosensitizers absorb visible light to induce their photo&#8208;excited states which can activate unreactive substrates via electron or energy transfer mechanisms, and organocatalysts are usually employed to control the chemical reactivities of the other substrates. This review mainly focuses on the recent development of cooperative catalysis by the combination of organocatalysis and photocatalysis in recent organic synthesis.

         <title>Mono&#8208; and Difluorinated Saturated Heterocyclic Amines for Drug Discovery: Systematic Study of Their Physicochemical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A comprehensive study of physicochemical properties (pKa, LogP, and intrinsic microsomal clearance) within the series of mono&#8208; and difluorinated azetidine, pyrrolidine, and piperidine derivatives was performed. While the number of fluorine atoms and their distance to the protonation center were the major factors defining the compound&#8217;s basicity, both pKa and LogP values were affected considerably by the conformational preferences of the corresponding derivatives. For example, features of &#8220;Janus face&#8221; (facially polarized) cyclic compounds (i.e., unusually high hydrophilicity) were identified for cis&#8208;3,5&#8208;difluoropiperidine, prefering a diaxial conformation. Intrinsic microsomal clearance measurements demonstrated high metabolic stability of the compounds studied (with a single exception of the 3,3&#8208;difluoroazetidine derivative). According to pKa &#8211; LogP plots, the title compounds provide a valuable extension of the fluorine&#8208;containing (e.g., fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted) saturated heterocyclic amine series as building blocks for rational optimization studies in early drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Tropane Scaffolds by an Organocatalyzed 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of 3&#8208;Oxidopyridinium Betaines and Dienamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tropane alkaloids constitute a compound&#8208;class which are structurally defined by a central 8&#8209;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane core. A diverse bioactivity profile combined with an unusual aza&#8208;bridged bicyclic framework has made tropanes molecules&#8208;of&#8208;interest within organic chemistry. Enantioselective examples of (5 + 2) cycloadditions between 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines and olefins remain unexplored, despite 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines being useful reagents in organic synthesis. We report the first asymmetric (5 + 2) cycloaddition of 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines, affording tropane derivatives in up to quantitative yield and with excellent control of peri&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity. The reactivity is enabled by dienamine&#8208;activation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes combined with in&#8208;situ formation of the pyridinium reaction&#8208;partner. A simple N&#8208;deprotection protocol allows for liberation of the tropane alkaloid motif, and synthetic elaborations of the cycloadducts demonstrate their synthetic utility to achieve highly diastereoselective modification around the bicyclic framework. DFT computations suggest a stepwise mechanism where regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity are defined during the first bond&#8208;forming step in which the pyridinium dipole exerts critical conformational control over its dienamine partner. In the second bond&#8208;forming step, a kinetic preference toward an initial (5 + 4) cycloadduct was identified; however, lack of catalyst turn&#8208;over, reversibility, and thermodynamic bias favoring a (5 + 2) cycloadduct render the reaction fully periselective.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, a new tellurium and mercury containing mercuraazametallamacrocycle has been prepared via (2+2) condensation of bis(o&#8208;aminophenyl)telluride and bis(o&#8208;formylphenyl)mercury(II). The isolated bright yellow solid of mercuraazametallamacrocycle has adopted unsymmetrical figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight conformation in the crystal structure. To study the metallophilic interactions between closed shell metal ions, the macrocyclic ligand has been treated with two equiv of AgOTf (OTf = trifluoromethansulfonate) and AgBF4, which afforded greenish&#8208;yellow bimetallic silver complexes. The isolated silver complexes displayed intramolecular Hg&#183;&#183;&#183;Ag, Te&#183;&#183;&#183;Ag interactions as well as intermolecular Hg&#183;&#183;&#183;Hg interactions and formed an extended 1D molecular chain by directing six atoms to interact as TeII&#183;&#183;&#183;AgI&#183;&#183;&#183;HgII&#183;&#183;&#183;HgII&#183;&#183;&#183;AgI&#183;&#183;&#183;TeII in a non linear fashion. The Hg&#183;&#183;&#183;Ag, Te&#183;&#183;&#183;Ag interactions have also been studied in solution by 199Hg, 125Te NMR spectroscopy, absorption, and emission spectroscopy. In DFT calculations, the Atom in Molecule (AIM) analysis, non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCI), natural bonding orbital (NBO) analysis strongly supported for experimental evidences and revealed that the intermolecular Hg&#183;&#183;&#183;Hg interaction is stronger than the intramolecular Hg&#183;&#183;&#183;Ag interactions.</dc:description>

N&#8208;aryl amide bonds for peptide conformation: In the universe of peptides,theN&#8208;aryl amide bond, with its large steric and electronic effects and ability to restrain amide bond rotation, is represented as a new star. By employing N&#8208;arylation as a backbone amide modification strategy in peptides, we could unravel the different worlds of distinct and predominantly homogeneous conformations in cyclic hexa&#8208; and cyclic pentapeptides containing one or two N&#8208;aryl amide bonds.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Stabilized Liquid Crystal Films Containing Dithienyldicyanoethene&#8208;Based Chiral Photoswitch: Multi&#8208;Modulation for Environment&#8208;Adaptative Smart Windows</title>

         <dc:description>
An environment&#8208;adaptative smart window with multi&#8208;modulations is constructed by a dithienyldicyanoethene&#8208;based chiral photoswitch. The smart window can be automatically transformed from initial transparent state to light scattering state with the changes of external ambient conditions, and can be manually switched between the opaque state and transparent state through a low electric field, which greatly satisfies the diverse requirements for daily life.







Abstract
A polymer&#8208;stabilized liquid crystal (PSLC)&#8208;based environment&#8208;adaptative smart window with multi&#8208;modulations is demonstrated. This PSLC system contains a right&#8208;handed dithienyldicyanoethene&#8208;based chiral photoswitch and a chiral dopant, S811, with opposite handedness, of which the reversible cis&#8208;trans photoisomerization of the switch can drive self&#8208;shading of the smart window under UV light stimulus because of the transition from nematic phase to cholesteric one. With the assistance of solar heat, the opacity of the smart window can be deepened because the heat promotes the isomerization conversion rate of the switch. This switch has no thermal relaxation at room temperature, therefore, the smart window exhibits dual stabilization: transparent state (cis&#8208;isomer) and opaque state (trans&#8208;isomer). Moreover, the incident intensity of sunlight can be regulated by an electric field, which allows the smart window to adapt to some specific situations. Such an energy&#8208;saving device can be used in buildings and vehicles to control indoor temperature and adapt to the required ambiance.

         <title>Sulfonyl Diazaborine &#8216;Click&#8217; Chemistry Enables Rapid and Efficient Bioorthogonal Labeling
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we have systematically developed and deliberated an efficient bioorthogonal reaction via the rapid formation of sulfonyl&#8208;diazaborine. The conjugation is robust to demonstrate suitable application in cancer cell imaging and treatment.







Abstract
Finding an ideal bioorthogonal reaction that responds to a wide range of biological queries and applications is of great interest in biomedical applications. Rapid diazaborine (DAB) formation in water by the reactions of ortho&#8208;carbonyl phenylboronic acid with &#945;&#8208;nucleophiles is an attractive conjugation module. Nevertheless, these conjugation reactions demand to satisfy stringent criteria for bioorthogonal applications. Here we show that widely used sulfonyl hydrazide (SHz) offers a stable DAB conjugate by combining with ortho&#8208;carbonyl phenylboronic acid at physiological pH, competent for an optimal biorthogonal reaction. Remarkably, the reaction conversion is quantitative and rapid (k2&gt;103&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) at low micromolar concentrations, and it preserves comparable efficacy in a complex biological milieu. DFT calculations support that SHz facilitates DAB formation via the most stable hydrazone intermediate and the lowest energy transition state compared to other biocompatible &#945;&#8208;nucleophiles. This conjugation is extremely efficient on living cell surfaces, enabling compelling pretargeted imaging and peptide delivery. We anticipate this work will permit addressing a wide range of cell biology queries and drug discovery platforms exploiting commercially available sulfonyl hydrazide fluorophores and derivatives.

         <title>A Blueprint for Transforming Indigos to Photoresponsive Molecular Tools</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The blue dye indigo has historically been isolated from the plant family Indigofera and widely applied in the denim industry for producing blue jeans. The advantageous photochemical properties of indigo and its derivatives have now attracted the attention of the scientific community for their use as molecular photoswitches. In their review Review (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300981), C.&#8208;Y. Huang and S. Hecht detail the synthetic approaches to preparing indigos and discuss indigos&#8217; applications as photoresponsive molecular tools.

         <title>Electronic and Charge Transport Properties in Bridged versus Unbridged Nanohoops: Role of the Nanohoop Size</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of the hoop size on the electronic and charge transport properties of [5]&#8208; and [4]&#8208;cyclo&#8208;N&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;carbazoles is reported. In these examples, a small nanohoop is beneficial for good organization of the molecules into thin films, whereas a large one increases the density of structural defects. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Poriel and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300934).

         <title>Structural Interconversion Based on Intramolecular Boroxine Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel structural interconversion unit based on intramolecular boroxine formation has been developed. The interconversion of a macrocyclic triboronic acid (blue Japanese umbrella) and a tricyclic boroxine (green pinwheel) can be triggered by water or temperature. These unique interconversions are attributed to the entropic advantage of intramolecular boroxine formation. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Ono and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300995).

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Stachyurin and Casuarinin Focusing on C&#8208;Glycosidic Bond Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study developed a method for the divergent synthesis of stachyurin and casuarinin, focusing on the C&#8208;glycosidic bond reactivity. The proposed method applies to the syntheses of stachyurin and casuarinin analogues, thereby facilitating the utilization of their beneficial bioactivities.







Abstract
Stachyurin and casuarinin are ellagitannins, a class of polyphenols that exhibit various biological activities that have an impact on human health. Casuarinin is a stachyurin stereoisomer. These compounds contain the characteristic C&#8208;glycosidic bond between the open&#8208;chain d&#8208;glucose and the phenol aromatic ring. Therefore, chemical elucidation of the C&#8208;glycosidic bond reactivity is required to exploit their multiple bioactivities. This study developed a method for the divergent synthesis of stachyurin and casuarinin via the &#945;&#8208;selective C&#8208;glycosylation as well as the &#946;&#8208;selective introduction of the oxygen functional group, focusing on structural specificity. The proposed method applies to the syntheses of stachyurin and casuarinin analogues, thereby facilitating the utilisation of their beneficial bioactivities.

         <title>Metal&#8208;organic framework derived Cu&#8208;Ag interface for selective carbon monoxide electroreduction to acetate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical carbon monoxide reduction reaction (CORR) is a potential way to obtain high&#8208;value multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products. However, achieving high selectivity to acetate is still a challenge. Herein, we develop a two&#8208;dimensional Ag&#8208;modified Cu metal&#8208;organic framework (Ag0.10@CuMOF&#8208;74) that demonstrates Faradaic efficiency (FE) for C2+ products up to 90.4% at 200 mA cm&#8208;2 and an acetate FE of 61.1% with a partial current density of 122.2 mA cm&#8208;2. Detailed investigations show that the introduction of Ag on CuMOF&#8208;74 favors the generation of abundant Cu&#8208;Ag interface sites. In&#8208;situ attenuated total reflection surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy confirms that these Cu&#8208;Ag interface sites improve the coverage of *CO and *CHO and the coupling between each other and stabilize key intermediates *OCCHO and *OCCH2, thus significantly promoting to the acetate selectivity on Ag0.10@CuMOF&#8208;74. This work provides a high&#8208;efficiency pathway for CORR to C2+ products.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Synthesis of BODIPY&#8208;Hetero[5]Helicenes as Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Free&#160;Triplet Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Design of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free triplet photosensitizers (PSs) is a challenge for efficient photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer. Helicenes are twisted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) having efficient ISC which is proportional to their twisting angle. But difficult syntheses and weak absorption profile restrict their use as heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free triplet PSs for PDT applications. Boron containing PAHs, BODIPYs are highly recognized for outstanding optical properties. But planar BODIPY dyes have&#160;low ISC and thus they are also not very effective as PDT agents. Herein, we designed BODIPY and hetero[5]helicene fused dyes, BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicene&#160;with red shifted absorbances. All dyes have helical structures and their twisting angles are increased by substitutions at boron&#8208;center. The new dyes showed superior optical properties and high ISC with respect to [5]helicene. Interestingly their ISC efficiencies increase proportionally with their twisting angles. Theoretical calculations showed that energy gap of the S1 and T1 states decreases in BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicene as compared to planar BODIPY. This enhances their ISC rate which is responsible for high singlet oxygen generation. Finally, their potential applications as PDT agents were investigated and one of the dyes showed efficient cancer cell killing on photo&#8208;exposure. This new design strategy will be very useful for future development of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free PDT agents.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Windmill Probe for Multiplexed mRNA Detection and Cell Type Discrimination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accurate cancer diagnosis especially early diagnosis is of great importance for prompt therapy and elevated survival rate. mRNAs are widely used as biomarkers for cancer identification and treatment. mRNA expression levels are highly associated with cancer stage and malignant progression. Nevertheless, single type mRNA detection is insufficient and unreliable. Herein, we developed a DNA nano&#8208;windmill probe for in situ multiplexed mRNAs detection and imaging in this paper. The probe is designed to simultaneously target four types of mRNA through wind blades. Importantly, recognition of targets is independent from each other, which further facilitate cell type discrimination. The probe can specifically distinguish cancer cell lines from normal cells. In addition, it can identify changes in mRNA expression levels in living cells. The current strategy enriches the toolbox for improving the accuracy of cancer diagnosis and therapeutic solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>The Factor Beyond Schmidt's Criteria That Impact the Photo&#8208;Induced [2+2] Cycloaddition Reactivity and Photoactuation of Molecular Crystals Based on Cyclic Chalcone Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cyclic chalcone analogues of (E)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;dichlorobenzylidene)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;inden&#8208;1&#8208;one (BIO), (E)&#8208;2&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethylene)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;inden&#8208;1&#8208;one (NIO), (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;dichlorobenzylidene)benzofuran&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;one (BFO), and (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;dichlorobenzylidene)benzo[b]thiophen&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;one (BTO) have been synthesized. While the geometrical parameters for the molecular packing of the above four compounds did not exceed Schmidt's criteria, [2+2] cycloaddition did not occur in&#160;&#160;BIO and BTO. Single crystal structures and Hirshfeld surfaces analyses revealed that there were interactions of C=O&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H (CH2) existed between adjacent molecules in BIO. Therefore, the carbonyl and methylene groups linked with one carbon atom in carbon&#8208;carbon double bond were tightly confined in the lattice, acting as a tweezer to inhibit free movement of the double bond and suppressing [2+2] cycloaddition. In BTO, similar interactions of Cl&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;S and C=O&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H (C6H4) prevented free movement of the double bond. In contrast, the intermolecular interaction of C=O&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H only exists around the carbonyl group in BFO and NIO, leaving the C=C double bonds to move freely and allowing the occurrence of [2+2] cycloaddition. Driven by photodimerization, the needle&#8208;like crystals of BFO and NIO displayed evident photo&#8208;induced bending behavior. This work demonstrates that the intermolecular interactions around carbon&#8208;carbon double bond would affect the [2+2] cycloaddition reactivity except for Schmidt&#8217;s criteria. These findings provide valuable insights into the design of photomechanical molecular crystalline materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphorus Dendrimers for Metal&#8208;Free Ligation: Design of Multivalent Pharmacological Chaperones against Gaucher Disease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first phosphorus dendrimers built on a cyclotriphosphazene core and decorated with six or twelve monofluorocyclooctyne units were prepared. A simple stirring allowed the grafting of N&#8208;hexyl deoxynojirimycin inhitopes onto their surface by copper&#8211;free strain promoted alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition click reaction. The synthesized iminosugars clusters were tested as multivalent inhibitors of the biologically relevant enzymes &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase and acid &#945;&#8208;glucosidase, involved in Gaucher and Pompe lysosomal storage diseases, respectively. For both enzymes, all the multivalent compounds were more potent than the reference N&#8208;hexyl deoxynojirimycin. Remarkably, final dodecavalent compound proved to be one of the best &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase inhibitors described to date. These cyclotriphosphazene&#8208;based deoxynojirimycin dendrimers were then evaluated as pharmacological chaperones against Gaucher disease. Not only did these multivalent constructs cross the cell membranes but they were also able to increase &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase activity in Gaucher cells. Notably, dodecavalent compound allowed a 1.4&#8208;fold enzyme activity enhancement at a concentration as low as 100 nM. These new monofluorocyclooctyne&#8208;presenting dendrimers may further find numerous applications in the synthesis of multivalent objects for biological and pharmacological purposes.</dc:description>

         <title>Next Generation of Fluorometric Protease Assays: 7&#8208;Nitrobenz&#8208;2&#8208;oxa&#8208;1,3&#8208;diazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;amides (NBD&#8208;Amides) as Class&#8208;Spanning Protease Substrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorometric assays are one of the most frequently used methods in medicinal chemistry. Over the last 50 years, the reporter molecules for the detection of protease activity have evolved from first&#8208;generation colorimetric p&#8208;nitroanilides, through FRET substrates, and 7&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;methyl coumarin (AMC)&#8208;based substrates. The aim of further substrate development is to increase sensitivity and reduce vulnerability to assay interferences. Here, we describe a new generation of substrates for protease assays based on 7&#8208;nitrobenz&#8208;2&#8208;oxa&#8208;1,3&#8208;diazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;amides (NBD&#8208;amides). In this study, we synthesized and tested substrates for 10 different proteases from the serine&#8208;, cysteine&#8208;, and metalloprotease classes. Enzyme&#8208; and substrate&#8208;specific parameters as well as the inhibitory activity of literature&#8208;known inhibitors confirmed their suitability for application in fluorometric assays. Hence, we were able to present NBD&#8208;based alternatives for common protease substrates. In conclusion, these NBD substrates are not only less susceptible to common assay interference, but they are also able to replace FRET&#8208;based substrates with the requirement of a prime site amino acid residue.</dc:description>

         <title>Double Dynamic Structural Change Enabling Tricolor Chromism by the Realization of Apparent Two&#8208;electron Transfer to Skip the Open&#8208;shell State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most redox systems generally cannot avoid the involvement of open&#8208;shell species upon generating multiply charged species, which often reduces reversibility in multi&#8208;color electrochromic systems. In this study, we newly synthesized octakis(aminophenyl)substituted pentacenebisquinodimethane (BQD) derivatives and their hybrids with alkoxyphenyl analogues. Thanks to apparent twoelectron transfer accompanied by double dramatic changes in the structure of the arylated quinodimethane skeleton, the dicationic and tetracationic states were generated and isolated quantitatively because of the negligible steady&#8208;state concentration of intermediary open&#8208;shell species such as monocation or trication radicals. When two electrophores with different donating abilities are attached to the BQD skeleton, a dicationic state with a different color can be isolated in addition to the neutral and tetracationic states. For the latter of these, an interchromophore interaction induces a red&#8208;shift of the NIR absorptions, thus realizing tricolor UV/Vis/NIR electrochromic behavior involving only closed&#8208;shell states.</dc:description>

         <title>Superionic Conductivity in Sodium Zirconium Chloride&#8208;Based Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries are attracting intensive attention. Chloride&#8208;based solid electrolytes are promising candidates for use in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries because of their high chemical stability and low Young's modulus. Here, we report new superionic conductors based on polyanion&#8208;added chloride&#8208;based materials. Na0.67Zr(SO4)0.33Cl4 showed a high ionic conductivity of 1.6 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicated that the highly conducting materials are mainly a mixture of an amorphous phase and Na2ZrCl6. The conductivity might be dominated by the electronegativity of the central atom of the polyanion. Electrochemical measurements reveal that Na0.67Zr(SO4)0.33Cl4 is a sodium ionic conductor and is suitable for use as a solid electrolyte in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoting Amination of Furfural to Furfurylamine by Metal&#8208;support Interactions on Pd/MoO3&#8208;x Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reductive amination of carbonyl compounds is one of the most straightforward protocols to construct C&#8208;N bonds, but highly desires active and selective catalysts. Herein, Pd/MoO3&#8208;x catalysts are proposed for furfural amination, in which the interactions between Pd nanoparticles and MoO3&#8208;x supports can be easily ameliorated via varying preparation temperature toward efficient catalytic turnover. Thanks to the synergistic cooperation of MoV&#8208;rich MoO3&#8208;x and highly&#8208;dispersed Pd, the optimal catalysts afford the high yield of furfurylamine (84%) at 80 oC. Thereinto, MoV species not only acts as the acidic promoter to facilitate the activation of carbonyl groups, but also interacts with Pd nanoparticles to promote the subsequent hydrogenolysis of Schiff base N&#8208;furfurylidenefurfurylamine and its germinal diamine. The good efficiency of Pd/MoO3&#8208;x within a broad substrate scope further highlights the key contribution of metal&#8208;support interactions to the refinery of biomass feedstocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Fibrils Emerging from Droplets: Molecular Guiding Principles behind Phase Transitions of a Short Peptide&#8208;Based Condensate Studied by Solid&#8208;State NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biochemical reactions occurring in highly crowded cellular environments require different means of control to ensure productivity and specificity. Compartmentalization of reagents by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation is one of these means. However, extremely high local protein concentrations of up to 400 mg/ml can result in pathological aggregation into fibrillar amyloid structures, a phenomenon that has been linked to various neurodegenerative diseases. Despite its relevance, the process of liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition inside condensates is still not well understood at the molecular level. We thus herein use small peptide derivatives that can undergo both liquid&#8208;liquid and subsequent liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid phase transition as model systems to study both processes. Using solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we compare the structure of condensed states of leucine, tryptophan and phenylalanine containing derivatives, distinguishing between liquid&#8208;like condensates, amorphous aggregates and fibrils, respectively. A structural model for the fibrils formed by the phenylalanine derivative was obtained by an NMR&#8208;based structure calculation. The fibrils are stabilised by hydrogen bonds and side&#8208;chain &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, which are likely much less pronounced or absent in the liquid and amorphous state. Such noncovalent interactions are equally important for the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition of proteins, particularly those related to neurodegenerative diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimising Electrical Interfacing between the Trimeric Copper Nitrite Reductase and Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the immobilization of copper&#8208;containing NiR from Alcaligenes faecalis on functionalised MWCNT electrodes. We demonstrate that this immobilization is mainly driven by hydrophobic interactions, promoted by the modification of MWCNTs with adamantyl groups. Direct electrochemistry shows high bioelectrochemical reduction of nitrite at the redox potential of NiR with high current density of 1.41 mA cm&#8208;2. Furthermore, the desymmetrization of the trimer upon immobilization induces an independent electrocatalytic behavior for each of the three enzyme subunits, corroborated by an electron&#8208;tunneling distance dependence.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Samarium diiodide (SmI2) is widely used as a strong one&#8208;electron reducing agent and is often employed to form C&#8208;&#8208;C bonds in complex systems. Despite their utility, SmI2 and related salts suffer from several drawbacks that render the use of Sm reducing agents in large&#8208;scale synthesis impractical. Here, we report factors influencing the electrochemical reduction of Sm(III) to Sm(II), towards the goal of electrocatalyti Sm(III) reduction. We probe the effect of supporting electrolyte, electrode material, and Sm precursor on Sm(II)/(III) redox and on the reducing power of the Sm species. We find that the coordination strength of the counteranion of the Sm salt affects the reversibility and redox potential of the Sm(II)/(III) couple and establish that the counteranion primarily determines the reducibility of Sm(III). Electrochemically generated SmI2 performs similarly to commercial SmI2 solutions in a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept reaction. The results will provide fundamental insight to facilitate the development of Sm&#8208;electrocatalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Piezochromism and Conductivity Modulations under High Pressure by Manipulating the Viologen Radical Concentration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manipulating the  radical concentration to modulate the properties in solid multifunctional materials is an attractive topic in various frontier fields. Viologens have the unique redox capability to generate radical states through reversible electron transfer (ET) under external stimuli. Herein, taking the viologens as the model, two kinds of crystalline compounds with different molecule&#8208;conjugated systems were designed and synthesized. By subjecting the specific model viologens to pressure, the cross&#8208;conjugated 2&#8208;X all exhibit much higher radical concentrations, along with more sensitive piezochromic behaviors, compared to the linear&#8208;conjugated 1&#8208;X. Unexpectedly, we find that the electrical resistance (R) of 1&#8208;NO3 decreased by three orders of magnitude with the increasing pressure, while that in high&#8208;radical&#8208;concentration 2&#8208;NO3remained almost unchanged. To date, such unusual invariant conductivity has not been documented in molecular&#8208;based materials under high pressure, breaking the conventional wisdom that the generations of radicals are beneficial to improve conductivity. We highlight that adjusting the molecular conjugation modes can be used as an effective way to regulate the radical concentrations and thus modulate properties rationally.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Manipulating the  radical concentration to modulate the properties in solid multifunctional materials is an attractive topic in various frontier fields. Viologens have the unique redox capability to generate radical states through reversible electron transfer (ET) under external stimuli. Herein, taking the viologens as the model, two kinds of crystalline compounds with different molecule-conjugated systems were designed and synthesized. By subjecting the specific model viologens to pressure, the cross-conjugated 2-X all exhibit much higher radical concentrations, along with more sensitive piezochromic behaviors, compared to the linear-conjugated 1-X. Unexpectedly, we find that the electrical resistance (R) of 1-NO3 decreased by three orders of magnitude with the increasing pressure, while that in high-radical-concentration 2-NO3remained almost unchanged. To date, such unusual invariant conductivity has not been documented in molecular-based materials under high pressure, breaking the conventional wisdom that the generations of radicals are beneficial to improve conductivity. We highlight that adjusting the molecular conjugation modes can be used as an effective way to regulate the radical concentrations and thus modulate properties rationally.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity based on Dibenzodioxin Linkage: Design, Synthesis, Properties and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) over the last two decades have established them as a distinct class of microporous materials, which combine the attributes of microporous solid materials and soluble nature of glassy polymers. Because of their solubility in common organic solvents, PIMs are easily processable materials that can potentially find applications in membrane&#8208;based separation, catalysis, ion separation in electrochemical energy storage devices, sensing, etc. Dibenzodioxin linkage, Tr&#246;ger&#8242;s base and imide bond&#8208;forming reactions have widely been utilized for synthesis of a large number of PIMs. Among these linkages, however, majority of the studies have been based on dibenzodioxin&#8208;based PIMs. Therefore, this review focuses precisely on dibenzodioxin linkage chemistry. Herein, we discuss the design principles of different rigid and contorted monomer scaffolds, synthetic strategies of the polymers through dibenzodioxin&#8208;forming reactions including copolymerization and postsynthetic modifications, their characteristic properties and potential applications studied so far. Towards the end, we discuss the prospects of these materials with respect to their utility in industrial purposes. Further, we analyze the structure&#8208;property correlation of dibenzodioxin PIMs, which is essential for tailored synthesis and tunable properties of these PIMs and their molecular level engineering for enhanced performances making these materials suitable for commercial usage.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclotrimerization Approach to Symmetric [9]&#8208;Helical Indenofluorenes: Diverting Cyclization Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic cyclotrimerization routes to symmetrical [9]helical indenofluorene were explored by using different transition metal complexes and thermal conditions. Depending on reaction conditions, the cyclotrimerizations were accompanied by dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction giving rise to another type of aromatic compounds. Structures of both symmetrical [9]helical cyclotrimerization product as well as the dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder product were confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Limits of enantioselective cyclotrimerization were assessed as well. DFT calculations shed light on the reaction course and the origin of diminished enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Access to Encapsulated Molecular Rotors via Coordination&#8208;Driven Macrocycle Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocycle formation that relies upon trans metal coordination of appropriately placed pyridine ligands within an arylene ethynylene construct provides rapid and reliable access to molecular rotors encapsulated within the macrocyclic framework. Showing no significant close contacts to the central rotors, X&#8208;ray crystallography of Ag(I)&#8208;coordinated macrocycles provides plausibility for free rotation or wobbling of rotors within the central cavity. Solid&#8208;state 13C NMR of Pd(II)&#8208;coordinated macrocycles supports the notion of unobstructed movement of simple arenes in the crystal lattice. Solution 1H NMR studies indicate complete and immediate macrocycle formation upon introduction of Pd(II) to the pyridyl&#8208;based ligand at room temperature. Moreover, the formed macrocycle is stable in solution; a lack of significant changes in the 1H NMR spectrum upon cooling to &#8208;50 &#176;C is consistent with the absence of dynamic behavior. The synthetic route to these macrocycles is expedient and modular, providing access to rather complex constructs in four simple steps involving Sonogashira coupling and deprotection reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Smart Wearable Patches Using Light&#8208;Controlled Activation and Delivery of Photoswitchable Antimicrobial Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel strategy to treat Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) skin infections is presented, where UV light is used to facilitate concomitant light&#8208;controlled activation and delivery of an antimicrobial therapeutic agent. Specifically, a new photoswitchable gramicidin S analogue was immobilized onto a polymeric wearable patch via a photocleavable linker that undergoes photolysis at the same wavelength of light required for activation of the peptide. Unlike toxic gramicidin S, the liberated active photoswitchable peptide exhibits antimicrobial activity against S. aureus while being ostensibly non&#8208;haemolytic to red blood cells. Moreover, irradiation with visible light switches off the antimicrobial properties of the peptide within seconds, presenting an ideal strategy to regulate antibiotic activity for localized bacterial infections with the potential to mitigate resistance.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalyzed (3+2) Cycloaddition for the Dearomatization of Electron&#8208;poor Arenes under Flow Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photocatalyzed dearomative reaction between various electron&#8208;deficient aromatic compounds and a non&#8208;stabilized azomethine ylide is successfully performed in a flow system. Whereas the use of supported eosin as organic photocatalyst exhibits limited efficiency, turning to the soluble Rose Bengal allows to transform a broad range of substrates from hetarenes (indole, benzofuran, quinoline, pyridine) to naphthalenes and benzenes. This photocatalyzed (3+2) dearomative cycloaddition under green light irradiation provides a simple and efficient access to tridimensional pyrrolidino scaffolds with a tetrasubstituted carbon center at ring junction and can be performed in the friendly ethyl acetate. Computational studies support the mechanism involving azomethine ylide as reactive species toward the electron&#8208;poor arene.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Pillar[5]arene Host&#8208;Guest Complexation to Improve pH Stability and Affect Enzymatic Degradation of the Anticancer Prodrug Capecitabine: A 19F&#8208;NMR Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Cancer is a global health problem and supramolecular chemotherapy is emerging as a novel strategy to battle the disease. Here we first evaluated the thermodynamic and the kinetic stability of the complexes formed between several water&#8208;soluble per&#8208;substituted pillar[5]arene derivatives and capecitabine (1), a widely used oral chemotherapeutic prodrug. The exchange rate was studied, for the first time in pillararene chemistry, by the 19F guest exchange saturation transfer (GEST) NMR technique. Importantly, when we evaluated the effect of complexation on the characteristics of 1, we found that the complexation of 1 with such pillar[5]arene hosts increased capecitabine stability at acidic pH very significantly and slowed its enzymatic degradation by the carboxylesterase enzyme in a manner that depended on the host. These interesting findings may have implications on clinical use of this heavily used prodrug and may affect the management of cancer patients.</dc:description>

In the coupling reactions of dibromobenzotriazole, dibromobenzoxazole, and dibromobenzothiadiazole with pinacol phenylboronate, the product ratios of monosubstituted product to disubstituted product were 0/100, 27/73, and 89/11, respectively, indicating that the Pd catalyst undergoes intramolecular catalyst transfer on dibromobenzotriazole, whereas intermolecular transfer occurs in part in the case of dibromobenzoxazole and is predominant for dibromobenzothiadiazole. The polycondensation of 1.3 equivalents of dibromobenzotriazole with 1.0 equivalent of para&#8208; and meta&#8208;phenylenediboronates afforded high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymer and cyclic polymer, respectively. In the case of dibromobenzoxazole, however, para&#8208; and meta&#8208;phenylenediboronates afforded moderate&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymer with bromine at both ends and cyclic polymer, respectively. In the case of dibromobenzothiadiazole, they afforded low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers with bromine at both ends. Addition of benzothiadiazole derivatives interfered with catalyst transfer in the coupling reactions.</dc:description>
