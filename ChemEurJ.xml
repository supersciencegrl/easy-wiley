         <title>Anion&#8208;Substituted Hybrid Zinc Halides with Remarkable Dielectric Switches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermo&#8208;responsive dielectric switching hybrid halides, displaying reversible dielectric bistability, have recently made them highly versatile and attractive for their structural tunability and rich functional properties. However, the substantial improvement of the dielectric switching operating range is limited near room temperature, and obtaining ultra&#8208;wide dielectric switching temperature region is a major challenge. Herein, a remarkable dielectric switching effect is reported with ultra&#8208;wide dielectric switching temperature region in a hybrid halide system, caused by dipolar orientational polarization ascribing order&#8208;disorder phase transitions. The new A2BX4 hybrid halide [C6H5(CH2)4NH3]2ZnBr4 (4PBA&#8208;ZnBr4) with an ultra&#8208;wide dielectric hysteresis loop of about 55&#160;K near room temperature is designed successfully through halogen substitution. Meanwhile, structurally similar hybrid materials 4PBA&#8208;ZnI4 were designed as controls. More interestingly, the crystal structure, phase transition temperature (Tc), dielectric and semiconductor properties exhibit significant discrepancies as the halogen atoms vary from Br to I. This discovery provides an efficiently regulated anionic framework to construct hybrid halides with ultra&#8208;wide high dielectric switching and reliable cycling stability by assembling with various cations, making them potentially excellent candidates for highly responsive room temperature smart switches or transducer devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Triarylmethanol Derivatives with Ultralong Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triphenylmethyl&#8208;based compounds such as rhodamines and fluoresceine representing an old and well&#8208;known class of triphenylmethane dyes, are widely used in fluorescent labeling of bioimaging. Inspired by ultralong room temperature phosphorescence of triphenylphosphine derivatives, herein we report a methoxy substituted triarylmethanol ((4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)diphenylmethanol, LJW&#8208;1) exhibits ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) under ambient condition with afterglows of about 7 seconds. Its multiple C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; intermolecular interactions, C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O intermolecular interactions, hydrogen bond and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions are beneficial for forming rigid environment in the aggregated state which is evidently an important factor in the appearance of excellent RTP. Different substituents on triarylmethanol result in compounds with different lifetimes varying from 7 &#181;s to 818 ms. The substituent effects on the phosphorescence of triarylmethanol derivatives provide an efficient method for the design of organic RTP materials and may be enlightening the phosphorescence research of triarylmethanol derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Dots Enabling High&#8208;Performances Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dots (CDs), known for their quantum size, abundant surface functional groups, excellent biocompatibility, and non&#8208;toxicity, have emerged as promising candidates for enhancing various advanced rechargeable batteries. Recent research indicates that electrodes based on or modified with CDs in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have shown significant improvements in key performance metrics such as Coulombic efficiency, cycle life, and capacity compared to traditional electrodes. Several key impacts of CDs contribute to these enhancements, including increased conductivity due to their conductive graphitized core, rich absorption sites, and excellent dispersity facilitated by abundant surface functional groups. These features accelerate ion transport through interface edges and ion diffusion paths, inhibit electrode material dissolution, buffer electrode material volume expansion, ensure electrode uniformity and stability, and promote the electrochemical reaction process between the electrode and electrolyte. This review summarizes recent developments, challenges, and opportunities in leveraging CDs as additives in SIBs, focusing on their impact on electrolyte properties, electrode materials, and overall battery performance. It provides a comprehensive understanding of the potential of CDs to significantly advance SIB technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Na ions doped Fe2VO4 cathode for high performance aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc ion batteries are thought to be a new generation of secondary batteries that will replace lithium ion batteries due to their great safety and inexpensive cost. In the cathode materials of aqueous zinc ion batteries with long life and high capacity, abundant active sites and crystal structure stability play an important role. In the present work, the strategy of Na+ intercalation of Fe2VO4 (FVO) is proposed, aiming at the insertion of Na+, which not only enriches the active sites, but also sodium and iron ions act as guest species with the negatively charged VOx lattice to provide strong electrostatic attraction to stabilize the lamellar structure. In terms of electrochemical performance, the discharge specific capacity is 370 mAh g&#8208;1 at a current density of 0.1 A g&#8208;1, and when the current density is arising 5 A g&#8208;1, the specific capacity also reaches 200 mAh g&#8208;1 after cycling 2000 with a capacity retention of 99%, which is better than the electrochemical performance of Fe2VO4 (FVO) alone at 50 mAh g&#8208;1. The superior electrochemical performance proves that FVO&#8208;Na is an ideal cathode material for zinc ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorine Labeling and 19F NMR Spectroscopy to Study Biological Molecules and Molecular Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy represents a key methodology for studying biomolecules and their interplay with other molecules. Recent developments in labeling strategies have made it possible to incorporate fluorine into proteins and peptides reliably, with manageable efforts and, importantly, in a highly site&#8208;specific manner. Paired with its excellent NMR spectroscopic properties and absence in most biological systems, fluorine has enabled scientists to investigate a rather wide range of scientific objectives, including protein folding, protein dynamics and drug discovery. Furthermore, NMR spectroscopic experiments can be conducted in complex environments, such as cell lysate or directly inside living cells. This review presents selected studies demonstrating how&#160;19F NMR spectroscopic approaches enable to contribute to the understanding of biomolecular processes. Thereby the focus has been set to labeling strategies available and specific NMR experiments performed to answer the underlying scientific objective.</dc:description>

         <title>A New Platform Molecule from Gluconolactone? Access to Furanics, Rare Sugars, &#946;&#8208;Ketoamides and Amino Furanones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gluconolactone serves as a readily available and inexpensive starting material for synthesizing the potential platform chemical (Z)&#8208;3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;1,2:5,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;isopropylidene&#8208;D&#8208;erythro&#8208;hex&#8208;3&#8208;enolactone in two steps. In this work, the selective elimination of triacetone gluconolactone was optimized. The resulting product is a versatile molecule, capable of being transformed into various compound classes in one or a few steps, i.e. potentially a new biomass&#8208;based platform chemical. This study demonstrates how it can be transformed into furanics, rare sugars, &#946;&#8208;ketoamides, and amino furanones.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantum Information Patterns Between Atoms in a Molecule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 60, October 28, 2024. </description>

Atoms in a molecule are conceptual open quantum systems that exchange information. Quantifying that information allows for the characterization of such quantum atoms and how they interact with their molecular environment.







Abstract
Quantum information theory provides a powerful toolbox of descriptors that characterize many&#8208;electron systems based on quantum information patterns between open quantum systems. Despite the wealth of insights gained in the condensed matter community, the use of these descriptors to study interactions between atoms in a molecule remains limited. In this study, we develop a quantum information framework for molecules that characterizes the quantum information patterns between quantum atoms as defined in the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules. We show that quantum information analyses capture key properties of quantum atoms and how they interact with their molecular environment. Additionally, we show that the presence of bond critical points can remain invariant despite large changes in the quantum information patterns between the quantum atoms. Our findings indicate that quantum information theory can shed a new light on molecular electronic structure.

         <title>Non&#8208;Medical Applications of Inorganic Medicines. A Switch Based on Mechanistic Knowledge</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 60, October 28, 2024. </description>

Starting from the description of integrated approaches for unveiling the molecular interactions underlying the biological effects of metallodrugs, through selected examples, it is highlighted how the obtained mechanistic information may turn relevant for the application of inorganic drugs in fields different from medicine.







Abstract
Metals have been used in medicine for centuries. However, it was not until much later that the effects of inorganic drugs could be rationalized from a mechanistic point of view. Today, thanks to the technologies available, this approach has been functionally developed and implemented. It has been found that there is probably no single biological target for the pharmacological effects of most inorganic drugs. Herein, we present an overview of some integrated and multi&#8208;technique approaches to elucidate the molecular interactions underlying the biological effects of metallodrugs. On this premise, selected examples are used to illustrate how the information obtained on metal&#8208;based drugs and their respective mechanisms can become relevant for applications in fields other than medicine. For example, some well&#8208;known metallodrugs, which have been shown to bind specific amino acid residues of proteins, can be used to solve problems related to protein structure elucidation in crystallographic studies. Diruthenium tetraacetate can be used to catalyze the conversion of hydroxylamines to nitrones with a high selectivity when bound to lysozyme. Finally, a case study is presented in which an unprecedented palladium/arsenic&#8208;mediated catalytic cycle for nitrile hydration was discovered thanks to previous studies on the solution chemistry of the anticancer compound arsenoplatin&#8208;1 (AP&#8208;1).

         <title>Differential Sensing Approach as a Pattern&#8208;based Discrimination for Biological Samples</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 60, October 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A differential sensing strategy offers great potential for biological sample discrimination and diagnostics. Distinctive response patterns were generated for various bacteria, viruses, and biofluids with different disease states using a series of sensor arrays, including colorimetric off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf dyes, surface&#8208;functionalized nanoparticles and fluorophores, graphene oxide, fluorescent reporters, and chemosensors.







Abstract
The differential sensing approach uses fingerprint patterning to distinguish uncharacterized biological samples. Inspired by natural sensory systems, an array of cross&#8208;reactive sensors generates unique response fingerprint depending on the samples. Until today, this array system has been developed using various materials, including the library of surface&#8208;charged nanoparticles and chemosensors. Many differential array systems have demonstrated accurate identification of bacterial species, viral subtypes, and cancer cells, as well as distinguishing disease states in blood or urine. This capability is particularly important for distinguishing between normal and abnormal states when specific marker molecules have not yet been identified, providing a powerful diagnostic tool. In this concept, we summarized representative outcomes of differential sensing applications for biological sample discrimination.

         <title>Controlling (E/Z)&#8208;Stereoselectivity of &#8722;NHC=O Chlorination: Mechanism Principles for Wide Scope Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 60, October 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the increasing interest in halo compounds in chemotherapy and protein modification/targeting in chiral bioenvironments, controlling the halogenation stereoselectivity is state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art science. Halogenation of carbamoyl group (&#8722;NHC=O) has never been mechanistically studied. Herein, we dive into depths of regioselectivity and stereoselectivity, provide the first comprehensive mechanism highlighting the selectivity&#8208;limiting factors and provide subsequent inspirations to control the (E/Z)&#8208;stereochemical output and insights into multidisciplinary applications.







Abstract
Organic halogen compounds are cornerstones of applied chemical sciences. Halogen substitution is a smart molecular design strategy adopted to influence reactivity, membrane permeability and receptor interaction. Chiral bioreceptors may restrict the stereochemical requirements in the halo&#8208;ligand design. Straightforward (but expensive) catalyzed stereospecific halogenation has been reported. Historically, PCl5 served access to uncatalyzed stereoselective chlorination although the stereochemical outcomes were influenced by steric parameters. Nonetheless, stereochemical investigation of PCl5 reaction mechanism with carbamoyl (RCONHX) compounds has never been addressed. Herein, we provide the first comprehensive stereochemical mechanistic explanation outlining halogenation of carbamoyl compounds with PCl5; the key regioselectivity&#8208;limiting nitrilimine intermediate (8&#8208;Z.HCl); how substitution pattern influences regioselectivity; why oxadiazole byproduct (P1) is encountered; stereo&#8208;electronic factors influencing the hydrazonoyl chloride (P2) production; and discovery of two stereoselectivity&#8208;limiting parallel mechanisms (stepwise and concerted) of elimination of HCl and POCl3. DFT calculations, synthetic methodology optimization, X&#8208;ray evidence and experimental reaction kinetics study evidence all supported the suggested mechanism proposal (Scheme&#8197;2). Finally, we provide mechanism&#8208;inspired future recommendations for directing the reaction stereoselectivity toward elusive and stereochemically inaccessible (E)&#8208;bis&#8208;hydrazonoyl chlorides along with potentially pivotal applications of both (E/Z)&#8208;stereoisomers especially in medicinal chemistry and protein modification.

When heavy atom tunneling regime is attained, the free energy reaction profile tunnels below the potential energy profile due to the inclusion of nuclear quantum effects. Ring Polymer Molecular Dynamics simulations are able to provide free energy and rate constants describing this phenomenon. Here we use the Cope's rearrangement of semibullvalene as prototypical reaction.







Abstract
In this work, we characterize the temperature dependence of kinetic properties in heavy atom tunneling reactions by means of molecular dynamics simulations, including nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) via Path Integral theory. To this end, we consider the prototypical Cope rearrangement of semibullvalene. The reaction was studied in the 25&#8211;300&#8197;K temperature range observing that the inclusion of NQEs modifies the temperature behavior of both free energy barriers and dynamical recrossing factors with respect to classical dynamics. Notably, while in classical simulations the activation free energy shows a very weak temperature dependence, it becomes strongly dependent on temperature when NQEs are included. This temperature behavior shows a transition from a regime where the quantum effects are limited and can mainly be traced back to zero point energy, to a low temperature regime where tunneling plays a dominant role. In this regime, the free energy curve tunnels below the potential energy barrier along the reaction coordinate, allowing much faster reaction rates. Finally, the temperature dependence of the rate constants obtained from molecular dynamics simulations was compared with available experimental data and with semi&#8208;classical transition state theory calculations, showing comparable behaviors and similar transition temperatures from thermal to (deep) tunneling regime.

         <title>Two&#8208;Coordinate Dinuclear Donor&#8208;Gold(I)&#8208;Acceptor Complexes Exhibiting Multiple Excitation Wavelength Dependent Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 60, October 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dinuclear donor&#8208;Au&#8208;acceptor complexes with intramolecular aurophilic interactions were synthesized. The increased metal contribution to the highest occupied molecular orbital enlarges S1&#8208;T1 energy gap, which disables the thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Moreover, unexpected excitation wavelength dependent multiple phosphorescence was observed, attributed to the poor internal conversion originating from the large energy separation and spatially isolated orbital between various excited states.







Abstract
Two&#8208;coordinate Au(I) complexes with a donor&#8208;metal&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;M&#8208;A) structure have shown rich luminescent properties. However, charge&#8208;neutral dinuclear donor&#8208;metal&#8208;acceptor type Au(I) complexes featuring aurophilic interactions have been seldom explored. Herein, we describe the structures and photoluminescence properties of two dinuclear Au(I) complexes, namely DiAu&#8208;Ph and DiAu&#8208;Me. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis of DiAu&#8208;Ph reveals a short intramolecular Au&#8208;Au distance of 3.224&#8197;&#197;. In dilute solution and doped films, excitation wavelength dependent multiple phosphorescence phenomena were observed for these dinuclear complexes. Theoretical calculations reveal that the aurophilic interaction causes increased contribution of the Au d orbital to the highest occupied molecular orbitals. Thus, the gap between singlet and triplet excited states (&#916;EST) is enlarged, which disables the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Moreover, the large energy separation (0.45&#8211;0.52&#8197;eV) and the different orbital configurations between the various excited states result in an inefficient internal conversion, accounting for their multiple phosphorescence properties.

         <title>Double Chalcogen Bonding Recognition Arrays in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 60, October 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work focused on the dimerization of newly synthetized Pyrselen derivatives, being evaluated both at the solid state (by XRD analysis) and in solution, by 77Se NMR dilution experiments carried out in CDCl3 at 298&#8197;K. Notably, the self&#8208;assembly at the liquid state is persistently observed in different solvents, highlighting the charge&#8208;transfer contribution of this interaction.







Abstract
N&#8208;substituted pyridino&#8208;based congeners of Ebselen, named here as Pyrselen, incorporating proximal Se and N atoms, undergo dimerization in solution and the solid state through a dual donor&#8208;acceptor arrangement of chalcogen bonding sites. Dimerization constants were measured within the 5&#8211;50&#8197;M&#8722;1 range. Computational studies on the dimers depict a notable charge&#8208;transfer contribution to the association, validating Pyrselen as an effective scaffold for designing chalcogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;based recognition motifs.

         <title>THz&#8208;EPR&#8208;based Magneto&#8208;Structural Correlations for Cobalt(II) Single&#8208;Ion Magnets With Bis&#8208;Chelate Coordination</title>

         <dc:description>
An experimental basis for understanding the structure&#8208;property relationships for tetrahedrally coordinated cobalt&#8208;based single&#8208;ion magnets is derived from precise zero&#8208;field splitting energies directly obtained by THz&#8208;EPR spectroscopy. A large elongation increases the magnetization barrier, while twisting of the chelate planes increases rhombicity and thus promotes relaxation by undesired quantum tunneling processes.







Abstract
New cobalt(II)&#8208;based complexes with [N2O2] coordination formed by two bis&#8208;chelate ligands were synthesized and characterized by a multi&#8208;technique approach. The complexes possess an easy&#8208;axis anisotropy (D&lt;0) and magnetic measurements show a field&#8208;induced slow relaxation of magnetization. The spin&#8208;reversal barriers, i.&#8201;e., the splitting of the two lowest Kramers doublets (UZFS), have been measured by THz&#8208;EPR spectroscopy, which allows to distinguish the two crystallographically independent species present in one of the complexes. Based on these experimental UZFS energies together with those for related complexes reported in literature, it was possible to establish magneto&#8208;structural correlations. UZFS linearly depends on the elongation parameter &#1013;T of the (pseudo&#8208;)tetrahedral coordination, which is given by the ratio between the average obtuse and acute angles at the cobalt(II) ion, while UZFS was found to be virtually independent of the twist angle of the chelate planes. With increasing deviation from the orthogonality of the latter, the rhombicity (|E/D|) increases.

         <title>Cyanide Linkage Isomerization Induced by Cobalt Oxidation&#8208;State Changes at a Co&#8722;Fe Prussian&#8208;Blue Analogue/ZnO Interface</title>

         <dc:description>
VSFG spectroscopy in combination with electrochemistry reveals critical interplay between interfacial oxidation and cyanide flip in Co&#8722;Fe Prussian Blue/ZnO heterostructure. Tuning the fabrication temperature for such heterostructure gives access to an easily accessible approach for controlling interfacial composition. This work shows that co&#8208;operativity at the molecular level facilitate kinetically demanding chemical processes at such interfaces.







Abstract
Understanding the interfacial composition in heterostructures is crucial for tailoring heterogenous electrochemical and photoelectrochemical processes. This work aims to elucidate the structure of a series of Co&#8722;Fe Prussian blue analogue modified ZnO (PBA/ZnO) electrodes with interface&#8208;sensitive vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy. Our measurements revealed, for the first time, a cyanide linkage isomerism at the PBA/ZnO interface, when the composite is fabricated at elevated temperatures. In situ VSFG spectro&#8208;electrochemistry measurements correlate the CoII&#8594;CoIII oxidation with the flip of the bridging CN ligand from Co&#8722;NC&#8722;Fe coordination mode to a Co&#8722;CN&#8722;Fe one. Photoluminescence measurements and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that this unprecedented linkage isomerism originates from surface defects, which act as oxidation sites for the PBA. The presence of such surface defects is correlated with the fabrication temperature for PBA/ZnO. Thus, this contribution identifies the interplay between the surface states of the ZnO substrates and the chemical composition of PBA at the ZnO surface, suggesting an easily accessible approach to control the chemical composition of the interface.

The presence of such surface defects is correlated with the fabrication temperature for PBA/ZnO. Thus, this contribution identifies the interplay between the surface states of the ZnO substrates and the chemical composition of PBA at the ZnO surface, suggesting an easily accessible approach to control the chemical composition of the interface.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Covalent Lysozyme Immobilization on Enzymatic Cellulose Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 60, October 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
TEMPO&#8208;oxidized cellulose nanocrystals (TO&#8208;CNCs) are an excellent substrate for the covalent immobilization of lysozyme from chicken egg white. The bioconjugates are synthesized, isolated and characterized and are potential candidates as antibacterial materials.







Abstract
Nanostructured materials represent promising substrates for biocatalyst immobilization and activation. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), accessible from waste and/or renewable sources, are sustainable and biodegradable, show high specific surface area for anchoring a high number of enzymatic units, and high thermal and mechanical stability. In this work, we present a holistic enzyme&#8208;based approach to functional antibacterial materials by bioconjugation between the lysozyme from chicken egg white and enzymatic cellulose nanocrystals. The neutral CNCs were prepared by endoglucanase hydrolysis from Avicel. We explore the covalent immobilization of lysozyme on enzymatic CNCs and on their TEMPO oxidized derivatives (TO&#8208;CNCs), comparing immobilization yields, material properties, and enzymatic activities. The materials were characterized by X&#8208;ray diffractometry (XRD), attenuated total reflectance Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;FTIR), bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay, field&#8208;emission scanning electron microscopy (FE&#8208;SEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). We demonstrate the higher overall efficiency of the immobilization process carried out on TO&#8208;CNCs, based on the success of covalent bonding and on the stability of the isolated bioconjugates.

         <title>A Two&#8208;Step Intermolecular Interaction Of Molecular Macroions With Multivalent Counterions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 60, October 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular cluster U60 macroion exhibits a very different solution behavior depending on the valences of added counterions. When multivalent counterions are introduced, unlike monovalent counterions, there is an additional step for the macroion&#8208;counterion interaction. The two&#8208;step mechanism can be nicely correlated to the microscopic (self&#8208;assembly) and macroscopic (gelation) phase transitions observed in the macroionic aqueous systems.







Abstract
Macroion&#8208;counterion interaction is essential for regulating the solution behaviors of hydrophilic macroions, as simple models for polyelectrolytes. Here, we explore the interaction between uranyl peroxide molecular cluster Li68K12(OH)20[UO2(O2)OH]60 (U60) and multivalent counterions. Different from interaction with monovalent counterions that shows a simple one&#8208;step process, isothermal titration calorimetry, combined with light/X&#8208;ray scattering measurements and electron microscopy, confirm a two&#8208;step process for their interaction with multivalent counterions: an ion&#8208;pairing between U60 and the counterion with partial breakage of hydration shells followed by strong U60&#8208;U60 attraction, leading to the formation of large nanosheets with severe breakage and reconstruction of hydration shells. The detailed studies on macroion&#8208;counterion interaction can be nicely correlated to the microscopic (self&#8208;assembly) and macroscopic (gelation or phase separation) phase transitions in the dilute U60 aqueous solutions induced by multivalent counterions.

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization and Photophysical Properties of a New Family of Rare&#8208;Earth Cluster&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 60, October 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The graphic depicts RE&#8208;CU&#8208;45, a rare&#8208;earth metal&#8208;organic framework, which features 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylic acid linkers and hexanuclear RE(III) clusters (RE(III)=Eu(III), Gd(III), Tb(III), Dy(III), Ho(III), Er(III), Tm(III), Yb(III), Lu(III), and Y(III)). The MOF linker can be excited at 290&#8197;nm and, through the antenna effect, promote energy transfer to the RE(III) ions, leading to emission in the visible and/or near&#8208;infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum.







Abstract
In this work, nine new rare&#8208;earth metal&#8211;organic frameworks (RE&#8208;MOFs, where RE=Lu(III), Yb(III), Tm(III), Er(III), Ho(III), Dy(III), Tb(III), Gd(III), and Eu(III)) isostructural to Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;808 are synthesized, characterized, and studied regarding their photophysical properties. Materials with high crystallinity and surface area are obtained from a reproducible synthetic procedure that involves the use of two fluorinated modulators. At the same time, these new RE&#8208;MOFs display tunable photoluminescent properties due to efficient linker&#8208;to&#8208;metal energy transfer promoted by the antenna effect, resulting in a series of RE&#8208;MOFs displaying lanthanoid&#8208;based emissions spanning the visible and near&#8208;infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.

         <title>Facile Method to Obtain Functionalised &#951;6&#8208;Bound Arenes in Ru(II) and Os(II) Half&#8208;Sandwich Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 60, October 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We pioneer the use of a practical C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp2) coupling method to obtain Ru(II)&#8208; and Os(II)&#8208;&#951;6&#8208;arene half&#8208;sandwich complexes with a wide variety of arene functionalities, including those that enable the formation of tether rings. We synthesise 28 new complexes bearing eight different substituents, mostly unreported for Ru(II) or Os(II) half&#8208;sandwich complexes, such as quinoline (tethered and non&#8208;tethered) and coumarin.







Abstract
Half&#8208;sandwich Ru(II)&#8208; and Os(II)&#8208;arene complexes have great potential for catalytic and biological applications. The possibility of fine&#8208;tuning their chemical reactivity by including modifications in the ligands around the metal adds to their many advantages. However, structural modifications at the &#951;6&#8208;bound arene have had significant synthetic limitations, particularly in the design of Os(II)&#8208;tethered complexes. For the first time, we have employed a practical C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp2) coupling to obtain 28 new Ru(II) and Os(II) &#951;6&#8208;arene half&#8208;sandwich complexes with a wide variety of arene functionalities, including those that enable the formation of tether rings, such as quinoline, and coumarin. The introduction of novel functional groups at the arene in Ru(II)&#8208; and Os(II) half&#8208;sandwich complexes can broaden the synthetic scope of this type of organometallic complexes, and help to take full advantage of their structural diversity, for example, in intracellular catalysis.

In the QM cluster approach an extract from the active site of an enzyme is used to calculate the fast reaction processes and spectroscopic features of short&#8208;lived intermediates. In their Review (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202402468), S.&#8197;P. de Visser, Chivukula&#8197;V. Sastri and co&#8208;workers describe the recommended approaches to set up and select QM cluster models. Furthermore, a range of examples are given that have validated QM cluster models against experiment and highlight that the calculations can predict the correct selectivity and find a free energy of activation close to experiment.

         <title>Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials for Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 60, October 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the recent application of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) techniques in the atomistic modeling of heterogeneous catalytic systems. A summary and best practices for utilizing MLIPs are provided, aiming to facilitate the application of MLIPs in the catalysis community.







Abstract
Atomistic modeling can provide valuable insights into the design of novel heterogeneous catalysts as needed nowadays in the areas of, e.&#8201;g., chemistry, materials science, and biology. Classical force fields and ab&#8197;initio calculations have been widely adopted in molecular simulations. However, these methods usually suffer from the drawbacks of either low accuracy or high cost. Recently, the development of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) has become more and more popular as they can tackle the problems in question and can deliver rather accurate results at significantly lower computational cost. In this review, the atomistic modeling of catalytic systems with the aid of MLIPs is discussed, showcasing recently developed MLIP models and selected applications for the modeling of heterogeneous catalytic systems. We also highlight the best practices and challenges for MLIPs and give an outlook for future works on MLIPs in the field of heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Stabilization Strategies of Lithium Metal Anode Toward Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 60, October 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the current issues of Li&#8722;S batteries were outlined. Then, we specially summarized the challenges of Li anode for Li&#8722;S, which included the heterogeneous deposition, unstable SEI layer and volume expansion. Furthermore, research progresses of stabilization strategies of Li anode (physical strategy, electrolyte optimization, surface protection layer and design of current collector) in Li&#8722;S batteries are highlighted.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries are considered as a most promising rechargeable lithium metal batteries because of their high energy density and low cost. However, the Li&#8722;S batteries mainly suffer the capacity decay issue caused by the shutting effect of lithium polysulfides and the safety issues arising from the Li dendrites formation. This review outlines the current issues of Li&#8722;S batteries. Furthermore, we comprehensively summarized the challenges encountered by Li anode in Li&#8722;S batteries, such as the heterogeneous deposition of the Li anode, the unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer, and volume expansion. Moreover, research progresses in the stabilization strategies of Li anodes (physical approaches, optimization of electrolyte, surface protection layer, and design of current collector) is discussed in detail. Lastly, the remaining challenges and future research directions of Li metal anode stabilization in Li&#8722;S batteries are also present.

Lastly, the remaining challenges and future research directions of Li metal anode stabilization in Li&#8722;S batteries are also present.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tutorial Review on the Set&#8208;Up and Running of Quantum Mechanical Cluster Models for Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 60, October 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Tutorial Review gives an overview on the set&#8208;up of QM cluster models that can be used for calculations on the mechanism of enzymatic reaction processes. Furthermore, recent examples are given that highlight the accuracy and reproducibility of the models and recommendations are given on best practice.







Abstract
Enzymes turnover substrates into products with amazing efficiency and selectivity and as such have great potential for use in biotechnology and pharmaceutical applications. However, details of their catalytic cycles and the origins surrounding the regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity of enzymatic reaction processes remain unknown, which makes the engineering of enzymes and their use in biotechnology challenging. Computational modelling can assist experimental work in the field and establish the factors that influence the reaction rates and the product distributions. A popular approach in modelling is the use of quantum mechanical cluster models of enzymes that take the first&#8208; and second coordination sphere of the enzyme active site into consideration. These QM cluster models are widely applied but often the results obtained are dependent on model choice and model selection. Herein, we show that QM cluster models can give highly accurate results that reproduce experimental product distributions and free energies of activation within several kcal mol&#8722;1, regarded that large cluster models with &gt;300 atoms are used that include key hydrogen bonding interactions and charged residues. In this tutorial review, we give general guidelines on the set&#8208;up and applications of the QM cluster method and discuss its accuracy and reproducibility. Finally, several representative QM cluster model examples on metal&#8208;containing enzymes are presented, which highlight the strength of the approach.

&lt;p&gt;Enzymes turnover substrates into products with amazing efficiency and selectivity and as such have great potential for use in biotechnology and pharmaceutical applications. However, details of their catalytic cycles and the origins surrounding the regio- and chemoselectivity of enzymatic reaction processes remain unknown, which makes the engineering of enzymes and their use in biotechnology challenging. Computational modelling can assist experimental work in the field and establish the factors that influence the reaction rates and the product distributions. A popular approach in modelling is the use of quantum mechanical cluster models of enzymes that take the first- and second coordination sphere of the enzyme active site into consideration.

         <title>Preparation and Electrochemical Applications of Magn&#233;li Phase Titanium Suboxides: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 60, October 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magn&#233;li phase titanium suboxides (M&#8208;TSOs) possess a unique shear&#8208;plane structure that provides exceptional conductivity and corrosion resistance, making them ideal electrode materials for electrochemical applications. This review introduces the preparation methods, electrochemical performance, and applications of M&#8208;TSOs and discusses their challenges and future research directions.







Abstract
Magn&#233;li phase titanium suboxides (M&#8208;TSOs) belong to a type of sub&#8208;stoichiometric titanium oxides based on the crystal structure of rutile TiO2. They possess a unique shear structure, granting them exceptional electrical conductivity and corrosion resistance. These two advantages are crucial for electrode materials in electrochemistry, hence the significant interest from numerous researchers. However, the preparation of M&#8208;TSOs is uneconomic due to high temperature reduction and other complex synthesis process, thus limiting their practical application in electrochemical fields. This review delves into the crystal structure, properties, and synthesis methods of M&#8208;TSOs, and touches on their applications as electrocatalysts in wastewater treatment and electrochemical water splitting. Furthermore, it highlights the research challenges and potential future research directions in M&#8208;TSOs.

         <title>Photo&#8208;triggered ROS&#8208;responsive Supramolecular Nanoprodrugs for Targeted and Synergistic Chemo/photodynamic/gas Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo&#8208;triggered ROS&#8208;responsive supramolecular nanoprodrugs (BNN6@GBTC NPs) are constructed via supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic prodrug molecule (GBTC) and NO donor (BNN6). BNN6@GBTC NPs possess good stability, ROS responsiveness, and selective HepG2 cells targetability via overexpressed galactose receptors on the cell membrane. When BNN6@GBTC NPs are taken up by HepG2 cells, they can generate ROS upon light irradiation, which can not only be used for photodynamic therapy, but also cleave the thioketal linkage to release camptothecin for chemotherapy. Meanwhile, BNN6 triggering release NO for gas therapy. BNN6@GBTC NPs enable targeted and synergistic chemo/photodynamic/gas therapy, which results in reduced damage to normal cells and enhanced anti&#8208;cancer efficacy in vitro. This work provides a novel approach for the design of nanoprodrugs based on supramolecular self&#8208;assembly to achieve the multimodal synergistic anti&#8208;cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Chain&#8208;like Pentanuclear Complexes: Syntheses, Crystal Structures and Long&#8208;range Electronic Interactions of Cyanido&#8208;Bridged M2Ru3 (M = Fe, Ru)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we report the design and synthesis of two chain&#8208;like pentanuclear cyanido&#8208;bridged complexes trans&#8208;[Ru(bpy)2(&#956;&#8208;CN)2][cis&#8208;Ru(bpy)2(&#956;&#8208;NC)M(dppe)Cp*]2[PF6]4(M = Fe, 14+; M = Ru, 24+) and the electronic communication properties of their oxidized products 1m+ (m = 6, 7, 8) and 2n+ (n = 5, 6, 7, 8). The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis&#160;of 1m+ (m = 4, 6, 7) and 24+ show that 14+ and 24+ possess a Z&#8208;type array structure, 17+ is a U&#8208;type one, and 16+ exhibits both the types. The investigations indicate that both 1 and 2 show an extraordinarily strong electronic interaction between the two side Ru across the central NC&#8208;Ru&#8208;CN, leading to the formation of a fully delocalized cyanidometal Ru&#8208;Ru&#8208;Ru bridge for both three&#8208;electron oxidized states 17+ and 27+. Moreover, it should be noted that in 1 there exists no electronic interaction between the two terminal Fe ions. Upon substitution of Fe by Ru, however, 2 exhibits an electronic interaction between the two terminal metal ions across the trinuclear cyanidometal CN&#8208;Ru&#8208;NC&#8208;Ru&#8208;CN&#8208;Ru&#8208;NC bridge which is up to 20 &#197;.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Self&#8208;Assembly of Antibody&#8208;Rhamnose Complex as a Pre&#8208;Targeting Strategy for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enhancing the Fc effector functions of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is a proven strategy for improving cancer immunotherapy. In this study, we present a novel pre&#8208;targeting approach that integrates host&#8208;guest chemistry with an antibody&#8208;recruiting concept to create mAbs with superior effector functions. Using rituximab (RTX), a clinically approved anti&#8208;CD20 mAb, as our model, we modified RTX by conjugating it with adamantane (Ada) derivatives and various polyethylene glycol (PEG) linkers to produce RTX&#8208;Ada conjugates. These conjugates effectively formed RTX&#8208;rhamnose (Rha) complexes in situ through self&#8208;assembly, driven by host&#8208;guest interactions with Rha&#8208;modified &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin. This mechanism successfully redirected endogenous anti&#8208;Rha antibodies to target cells, enhancing the availability of Fc domains for improved effector functions, including complement&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). A structure&#8208;activity relationship study indicated that the potency of these in situ complexes was significantly influenced by the length of the PEG linker used; shorter PEG linkers correlated with higher CDC activity. Given the variability in endogenous antibody levels among individuals, this strategy presents a flexible and promising platform for enhancing the efficacy of mAb&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Regio&#8208;, Site&#8208; and Stereo&#8208;Selective Aziridination of Conjugated Dienes Enabled by Palladium/Copper/Iodide/Oxygen Cooperation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinylaziridines are important building blocks in organic chemistry, especially in the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. The direct and efficient transfer of an appropriate nitrogen source to readily accessible conjugated dienes is a notable methodology. The Pd&#8208;catalyzed oxidative 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of conjugated dienes through a &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;palladium species should be an ideal method for the selective synthesis of vinylaziridines. However, this method faces the challenge of regioselectivity, often resulting in 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization instead. In this study, we developed a Pd&#8208;catalyzed aerobic 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of conjugated dienes via a &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;palladium species to achieve regio&#8208;, site&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective aziridination under the synergistic effects of Pd(II), Cu(I), I&#8208;, and O2. The &#960;&#8208;allyl palladium species formed in the system undergoes an unusual iodination process, leading to the formation of an allyl iodide intermediate. Subsequently, the vinylaziridine is obtained through intramolecular SN2' substitution of the allyl iodide.</dc:description>

         <title>Responsive Chirality: Tailoring Supramolecular Assemblies with External Stimuli as Future Platforms for Electronic/ Spintronic Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular chirality is the major branch of supramolecular chemistry, which not only plays important roles in biological processes but also in synthetically designed aggregated systems. &#160;To understand the complex processing of biological systems, the only way is to design supramolecular chiral ensembles that mimic natural biomolecules such as Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), Ribonucleic acid (RNA), amino acids, etc.&#160; In addition, chiral systems and self&#8208;assemblies as molecular motifs with breaking spatial inversion symmetry have been regarded as key substances in electronics and spintronics as well as in fundamental chemistry and physics. Here, in this review, our major concern is understanding modulation in spatial arrangements and packing modes under the impact of any external stimuli, which results in tailoring the handedness of resulted supramolecular chiral superstructures. We, in this review, highlighted the role of external stimuli such as solvent, chemical additives, photo exposure, etc. in altering the supramolecular chirality for their future utility as &#8220;active switches&#8221; in optoelectronic and spintronic devices and applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bifunctional catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are essential components of rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries. In this study, we synthesized a Pr0.5Ba0.5Mn0.8Co0.1Ru0.1O2.5+&#948; (PBMCRO) perovskite composite with in situ exsolved CoRu nanoparticles and Co&#8211;N&#8211;C, functioning as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for zinc&#8208;air batteries. The in situ exsolution of CoRu nanoparticles from the perovskite oxide was facilitated by the reducing action of 2&#8208;methylimidazole (2&#8208;MIM). Concurrently, Co&#8211;N&#8211;C was used to decorate PBMCRO, forming a novel bifunctional composite electrode of Co&#8211;N&#8211;C&#8211;PBMCRO. The incorporation of CoRu nanoparticles introduces a significant number of electrochemically active oxygen vacancies in the perovskite matrix, enhancing ORR and OER performance. Additionally, the Co&#8211;N&#8211;C synergistically improves electrochemical activity while preserving the structural stability of the perovskite oxide. The prepared Co&#8211;N&#8211;C&#8211;PBMCRO catalyst demonstrates significantly enhanced bifunctional performance compared to the undecorated pristine perovskite Pr0.5Ba0.5MnO3&#8211;&#948; (PBMO). The zinc&#8208;air battery with Co&#8211;N&#8211;C&#8211;PBMCRO catalyst achieve a peak power density of approximately 90 mW/cm2 and exhibit remarkable cycling stability for 788 h. This study presents a novel and effective strategy to enhance the catalytic performance of perovskite&#8208;based air electrodes for rechargeable metal&#8208;air batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>A Combined Experimental and Computational Exploration of Heteroleptic cis&#8208;Pd2L2L&#8217;2&#160;Coordination Cages through Geometric Complementarity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroleptic (mixed&#8208;ligand) coordination cages are of interest as host systems with more structurally and functionally complex cavities than homoleptic architectures. The design of heteroleptic cages, however, is far from trivial. In this work, we experimentally probed the self&#8208;assembly of Pd(II) ions with binary ligand combinations in a combinatorial fashion to search for new cis&#8208;Pd2L2L&#8217;2 heteroleptic cages. A hierarchy of computational analyses was then applied to these systems with the aim of elucidating key factors for rationalising self&#8208;assembly outcomes. Simple and inexpensive geometric analyses were shown to be effective in identifying complementary ligand pairs. Preliminary results demonstrated the viability of relatively rapid semi&#8208;empirical calculations for predicting the topology of thermodynamically favoured assemblies with rigid ligands, whilst more flexible systems proved challenging. Stemming from this, key challenges were identified for future work developing effective computational forecasting tools for self&#8208;assembled metallo&#8208;supramolecular systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Butafulvenes, together with pentafulvenes and [3]radialenes, form a series of constitutional benzene isomers in which aromaticity changes significantly and can be strongly substituent dependent. Butafulvene, as a member of this series, is frequently proposed to be antiaromatic.

         <title>Late&#8208;stage Functionalization using a Popular Titrating Agent: Aryl&#8208;Chlorides and &#8208;Fluorides Activation by the Diphenylacetic Acid Dianion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl&#8208;chlorides and &#8208;fluorides are common building blocks, but their use in synthesis is limited by the high stability of their Ar&#8208;X bonds. The generation of aryl radicals via activation of strong Ar&#8208;X bonds is possible through the irradiation of tailor&#8208;made organic anions, which become reductants stronger than lithium metal. We report that the combination of visible light with the cheap diphenylacetic acid dianion is an even better tool, showing excellent activity across a variety of complex substrates and providing opportunities for late&#8208;stage drug modification. Ar&#8208;X bonds are chemoselectively activated in the presence of more easily reducible functions, such as Alk&#8208;Cl ones and carbonyl groups. These results pave the way to original synthetic strategies that would be otherwise considered impossible</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the numerous published syntheses and applications of sulfoximines, very few studies describe their physico&#8208;chemical properties and in particular their acidic, basic and lipophilic or hydrophilic characters. We report for the first time the acidity values (pKa) of fluorinated sulfoximines in water and in acetonitrile, as well as the basicity (pKaH) measurements of fluorinated and non&#8208;fluorinated sulfoximines in acetonitrile. The same sulfoximine library was also studied in terms of lipophilicity with measurement of the Hansch parameters of the sulfoximine moieties. Finally, these new data allowed us to optimize the N&#8208;alkylation reaction of fluorinated sulfoximines.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Natural&#8208;Product&#8208;Inspired ABCB1 Inhibitors Through Regioselective Tryptophan C3&#8208;Benzylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective derivatization of cyclo&#8208;L&#8208;Trp&#8208;L&#8208;Trp scaffold affords 34 derivatives inspired by the anticancer nocardioazine alkaloids. These natural&#8208;product inspired molecules inhibit ABCB1 drug efflux pump in PaKiT03 bat cells. One inhibitor binds to drug&#8208;binding pocket and the other at the access tunnel region. Factors driving the binding efficacy to latter region turns out to be a better predictor of the overall ABCB1 inhibitory potency.







Abstract
The emergence of drug resistance in cancer cells eventually causing relapse is a serious threat that demands new advances. Upregulation of the ATP&#8208;dependent binding cassette (ABC) transporters, such as ABCB1, significantly contributes to the emergence of drug resistance in cancer. Despite more than 30&#8197;years of therapeutic discovery, and several generations of inhibitors against P&#8208;gp, the search for effective agents that minimize toxicity to human cells, while maintaining efflux pump inhibition is still underway. Leads derived from natural product scaffolds are well&#8208;known to be effective in various therapeutic approaches. Inspired by the biosynthetic pathway to Nocardioazine A, a marine alkaloid known to inhibit the P&#8208;gp efflux pump in cancer cells, we devised a regioselective pathway to create structurally unique indole&#8208;C3&#8208;benzyl cyclo&#8208;L&#8208;Trp&#8208;L&#8208;Trp diketopiperazines (DKPs). Using bat cells as a model to derive effective ABCB1 inhibitors for targeting human P&#8208;gp efflux pumps, we have recently identified exo&#8208;C3&#8208;N&#8208;Dbn&#8208;Trp2 (13) as a lead ABCB1 inhibitor. This C3&#8208;benzylated lead inhibited ABCB1 better than Verapamil.[21] Additionally, C3&#8208;N&#8208;Dbn&#8208;Trp2 restored chemotherapy sensitivity in drug&#8208;resistant human cancer cells and had no adverse effect on cell proliferation in cell cultures. For a clearer structure&#8208;activity relationship, we developed a broader screen to test C3&#8208;functionalized pyrroloindolines as ABCB1 inhibitors and observed that C3&#8208;benzylation is outperforming respective isoprenylated derivatives. Results arising from the molecular docking studies indicate that the interactions at the access tunnel between ABCB1 and the inhibitor result in a powerful predictor for the efficacy of the inhibitor. Based on fluorescence&#8208;based assays, we conclude that the most efficacious inhibitor is the p&#8208;cyano&#8208;derived exo&#8208;C3&#8208;N&#8208;Dbn&#8208;Trp2 (33&#8201;a), closely followed by the p&#8208;nitro substituted analogue. By combining assay results with molecular docking studies, we further correlate that the predictions based on the inhibitor interactions at the access tunnel provide clues about the design of improved ABCB1 inhibitors. As it has been well documented that ABCB1 itself is powerfully engaged in multi&#8208;drug resistance, this work lays the foundation for the design of a new class of inhibitors based on the endogenous amino acid&#8208;derived cyclo&#8208;L&#8208;Trp&#8208;L&#8208;Trp DKP scaffold.

         <title>Dynamic Phase Behavior of Surface&#8208;Active Fluorinated Ionic Liquid Epoxidation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated surface&#8208;active ionic liquids (FSAILs) containing catalytically active anions are highly efficient epoxidation catalysts. Tungstate&#8208;FSAILs serve as exceptionally potent epoxidations catalysts and enable control over the phase behavior in the highly efficient biphasic epoxidation of olefins with H2O2 under mild conditions. Additionally, catalyst recycling is demonstrated over ten subsequent runs without loss in activity or selectivity.







Abstract
We report on the synthesis of amphiphobic fluorinated surface&#8208;active ionic liquid (FSAIL) epoxidation catalysts, which show reversible temperature&#8208;controlled solubility in water. The solubility of FSAILs containing the catalytically active perrhenate&#8208; and tungstate anions was studied in both the aqueous and the substrate phase, showing a significant solubility decrease in both media compared to their non&#8208;fluorinated congeners. It was shown that both the epoxide product and the catalyst additive phenylphosphonic acid (PPA) are efficient in transferring the FSAIL catalyst into the organic phase, rendering the reaction homogeneous. The FSAILs were used as catalysts for the epoxidation of olefins using aqueous H2O2 as oxidant, showing an exceptionally high catalytic activity at mild conditions. Catalyst recycling was demonstrated over ten consecutive runs by phase separation and subsequent product distillation.

         <title>Peripheral Fusion of Carbon&#8208;Based Aromatic Rings to B4N4&#8208;Heteropentalene Leading to Close &#960;&#8208;Stacking in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule containing a hybrid system, in which aromatic rings are fused to the periphery of B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene, crystallizes into two polymorphs, both of which have one&#8208;dimensional &#960;&#8208;stacked columns, while exhibiting different photoconductive properties depending on the stacking geometries. Upon thermal vacuum deposition, this molecule forms an amorphous film that can serve as a host material for red phosphorescent OLEDs.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Electronic molecules with a BN&#8208;heterocyclic and carbon&#8208;based aromatic hybrid ring system (h&#8208;CBN) are interesting in that they potentially exhibit synergistic properties arising from the two different &#960;&#8208;systems. Here we report the synthesis and properties of a h&#8208;CBN&#8208;type molecule (1) having a bicyclic B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene core fused with extended aromatic rings. This molecule exhibits excellent chemical stability despite the absence of bulky substituents for kinetic protection, which in turn provides effective stacking of the &#960;&#8208;system upon crystallization. Depending on the crystallization solvent, 1 forms two polymorphs, i.&#8201;e., the &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;phases. While both phases have one&#8208;dimensional columnar structures, the &#960;&#8208;stacking geometries associated with the transfer integrals of the frontier orbitals are different, resulting in a twofold difference in the electrical conducting properties. We also found that upon thermal vacuum deposition, 1 gives an amorphous film, which serves as a host material for a red phosphorescent OLED device (maximum external quantum efficiency: 15.5 and 13.3&#8201;% at 0.1 and 2.5&#8197;mA, respectively).

         <title>Anchoring Pt Single&#8208;Atom Sites on Vacancies of MgO(Al) Nanosheets as Bifunctional Catalysts to Accelerate Hydrogenation&#8208;Cyclization Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing a defect engineering strategy, a bifunctional single&#8208;atom catalyst featuring Pt&#8208;O&#8722;Mg/Al moieties and Lewis basic sites was meticulously designed and constructed. This was achieved by anchoring platinum single&#8208;atom sites onto metal vacancies of MgO(Al) nanosheets, resulting in a 97.5&#8201;% yield and a record&#8208;breaking turnover frequency of 458.8&#8197;h&#8722;1 during the hydrogenation&#8208;cyclization of 2&#8208;nitroacylbenzene under mild conditions.







Abstract
The direct hydrogenation of 2&#8208;nitroacylbenzene to 2,1&#8208;benzisoxazole presents a significant challenge in the pharmaceutical and fine chemicals industries. In this study, a defect engineering strategy is employed to create bifunctional single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) by anchoring Pt single atoms onto metal vacancies within MgO(Al) nanosheets. The resultant Pt1/MgO(Al) SAC displays an exceptional catalytic activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation&#8208;cyclization of 2&#8208;nitroacylbenzene, achieving a 97.5&#8201;% yield at complete conversion and a record&#8208;breaking turnover frequency of 458.8&#8197;h&#8722;1 under the mild conditions. The synergistic catalysis between the fully exposed single&#8208;atom Pt sites within a unique Pt&#8208;O&#8722;Mg/Al moiety and the abundant basic sites of the MgO(Al) support is responsible for this outstanding catalytic performance. The current work, therefore, paves the way for developing bifunctional or multifunctional SACs that can enhance efficient organocatalytic conversions.

         <title>Formate Salt as a Bifunctional Reagent for Hydroxylation and Carbonylation Reactions Under Photochemically Driven Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate herein that formate salts can be used as a bifunctional reagent for hydroxylation reactions and as a CO source. The key to success is the unprecedented arylation of formate under activation&#8208;free conditions using a dual Ni/photocatalysis strategy. A wide range of phenols have been obtained, and the generated CO was used in a COware gas reactor for carbonylative processes. Interestingly, this new concept could be exploited for the direct access to 13C&#8208;labeled products.







Abstract
In this study, we disclose for the first time that formate salt can be used as a bifunctional reagent for the synthesis of phenol derivatives and as a CO source for carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling processes using the COware gas reactor under activation free conditions. Key to this success is the in&#8208;situ synthesis of aryl formate via an unprecedented nickel/organophotocatalyst system under blue LED irradiation. This developed system demonstrated high applicability to various aryl iodide substrates for synthesizing phenol derivatives. Moreover, the generated CO could be utilized in a range of carbonylative C&#8208;heteroatom and C&#8722;C processes. Notably, commercially available H13COONa salt can serve as a bifunctional reagent for both synthesizing phenols and generating 13CO.

         <title>Construction of Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Encapsulation of Menthol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of cyclodextrin based COFs were fabricated through a facile microwave method. These COFs, with higher surface area and new cavities compared to native CDs, enabled the encapsulation of menthol with higher efficiency, and the strengthening interaction between menthol and CD&#8208;COFs also enhanced the thermal stability of menthol. This innovative work significantly advances and expands menthol encapsulation strategies.







Abstract
The application of flavoring ingredients like menthol in the food industry is hindered by their high volatility and poor thermal stability, which lead to significant losses during processing and storage. Encapsulation of flavors into porous materials to obtain inclusion complexes (ICs) has proved to be an efficient strategy. In the present study, we synthesized a series of relatively food&#8208;safe three&#8208;dimensional anionic cyclodextrin&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (CD&#8208;COFs) with spiroborate linkages using a facile microwave&#8208;assisted method. The high surface area and newly formed cavities of COFs significantly enhanced the encapsulation efficiency of menthol compared to native CD materials. Our findings revealed that &#947;&#8208;CD&#8208;COF&#8722;Li, with Li+ as the counterion, achieved superior encapsulation efficiency of 25.9&#8201;%, outperforming &#947;&#8208;CD&#8208;COF&#8722;Na, &#947;&#8208;CD&#8208;COF&#8722;K and &#945;&#8208;CD&#8208;COF&#8722;Li under the same conditions. Thermal stability measurements show that the menthol/&#947;&#8208;CD&#8208;COF&#8722;Li&#8208;ICs effectively stabilize menthol against heat evaporation at elevated temperatures due to the strengthened interaction between menthol and &#947;&#8208;CD&#8208;COF&#8722;Li. The promising results of this research suggest that rapid advancements in COF technology will provide new opportunities for enhancing the stability of flavoring ingredients in the food industry.

         <title>Novel Methods for the Formation of Free Carbyne Radicals in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Radicalously simple&#8221;: we describe two new methods that produce free carbyne radicals) once considered very exotic) under mild conditions. Metallic zinc reacts with acetic anhydride to form 2&#8208;butyne and other products indicative of methyl&#8208;carbyne radical in solution. These reactive species are also obtained upon the degradation of a tri&#8208;molybdenum complex containing a 2&#8208;butyne ligand in aqueous solution.







Abstract
Carbyne free radicals RC&#924; (RC) are usually associated with high&#8208;energy processes, thus research on their preparation, chemical reactivity, and prevalence under mild conditions is scarce. Recently, it was reported that metallo&#8208;complexes containing CR ligands may undergo spontaneous degradation in aqueous solutions to produce free RC radicals. These highly reactive species may react with each other to form the corresponding alkyne and other products. The reaction of 1,1,1 halo&#8208;carbo&#8208;hydrates with Cr(II) ions also forms RC radicals under mild conditions. Herein, we report two additional synthetic routes that produce free RC radicals under mild conditions. First, the reaction between metallic zinc and acetic anhydride produces 2&#8208;butyne and several other C2, C3, and C4 compounds. Isotopic&#8208;labeling experiments indicate that the formation of 2&#8208;butyne results from an inter&#8208;molecular reaction in which two RC moieties from two acetic anhydride molecules combine in solution. In addition, the degradation of the tri&#8208;molybdenum complex [Mo3(H3CC=CCH3)(OAc)(H2O)2Br7], in which a 2&#8208;butyne ligand is coordinated to the Mo3 framework in a &#956;3&#8208;&#951;2 (&#8869;) binding mode in aqueous solution produces several C2, C3, C4 and C5 molecules. This indicates the formation of free CH3C radicals by a homolytic cleavage of the carbon&#8208;carbon triple bond.

         <title>Redox Activity of Co Species in the Active Sites of CoNx/CoOx Facilitates Oxygen Electrocatalysis for Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst Co/CoOx&#8208;NCNFs&#8208;0.1, characterized by abundant active species, large specific surface area, and considerable oxygen vacancy, was prepared through the combination of electrospinning process and annealing. Its catalytic mechanism involving the redox of Co (II and III) is proposed. The assembled ZABs exhibit high specific capacity (771&#8197;mAh&#8201;gZn&#8722;1), larger power density (981.6&#8197;mWh&#8201;gZn&#8722;1), and long&#8208;term stability (325&#8197;h).







Abstract
Developing efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts is crucial for enhancing the performance of rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). In this study, cobalt/cobalt oxides embedded in N&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers (Co/CoOx/NCNFs) were synthesized through a combination of electrospinning and annealing processes. The resulting Co/CoOx/NCNFs catalysts feature abundant CoNx and CoOx active species, leveraging the large specific surface area of nanofibers to facilitate oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The optimized Co/CoOx/NCNFs&#8208;0.1 achieved a half&#8208;wave potential (vs. RHE) of 0.82&#8197;V and required only 429&#8197;mV to reach 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a typical three&#8208;electrode system with 0.1&#8197;M KOH using an electrochemical workstation equipped with a pine instruments rotator, outperforming the Pt/C+RuO2. The assembled ZABs exhibited high specific capacity (771&#8197;mAh&#8201;gZn&#8722;1), substantial power density (981.6&#8197;mWh&#8201;gZn&#8722;1), and long&#8208;term stability (&gt;325&#8197;h). In situ Raman spectroscopy confirmed that the electrocatalytic processes involve the redox activity of Co (II and III) species derived from abundant CoNx and CoOx, elaborating the origin of the catalysts&#8217; exceptional oxygen electrocatalysis performance. This work not only presents a straightforward and effective approach for producing bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts in ZABs but also sheds light on the catalytic mechanisms underlying ORR and OER for CoNx/CoOx&#8208;based oxygen electrocatalysts.

Efficient transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free synthesis of benzo[b]azepines and oxindoles is achieved via a radical relay cascade strategy employing halogen atom transfer (XAT) for aryl radical generation followed by intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). Optimization yielded moderate to substantial yields under visible light irradiation. Preliminary biological assessments revealed promising anti&#8208;tumor activity for select compounds. This study underscores the potential of XAT&#8208;mediated radical relay cascades in medicinal chemistry and anticancer drug discovery.

         <title>Rational H2 Partial Pressure over Nickel/Ceria Crystal Enables Efficient and Durable Wide&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Zone Air&#8208;Level CO2 Methanation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigated the impact of H2/CO2 partial pressure ratios on CO2 methanation using Ni/CeO2. Results show elevated H2/CO2 ratios enhance CO2 conversion and CH4 selectivity, achieving complete methanation at 250&#8201;&#176;C and 100&#8201;% selectivity at 400&#8201;&#176;C. In&#8208;situ DRIFTS analysis indicates formate pathway dominance at higher ratios, key for CH4 production and CO2 mitigation strategies.







Abstract
On the way to carbon neutrality, directly catalyzing atmospheric CO2 into high&#8208;value chemicals might be an effective approach to mitigate the negative impacts of rising airborne CO2 concentrations. Here, we pioneer the investigation of the influence of the H2/CO2 partial pressure ratio (PPR) on air&#8208;level CO2 methanation. Using Ni/CeO2 as a case catalyst, increasing H2/CO2 PPR significantly improves low&#8208;temperature CO2 conversion and high&#8208;temperature CH4 selectivity, i.&#8201;e., from 10 of H2/CO2 PPR on, CO2 is completely methanized at 250&#8201;&#176;C, and nearly 100&#8201;% CH4 selectivity is achieved at 400&#8201;&#176;C. 100&#8208;hour stability tests demonstrate the practical application potential of Ni/CeO2 at 250&#8201;&#176;C and 400&#8201;&#176;C. In&#8208;situ DRIFTS reveal that reinforced formate pathway by increasing H2/CO2 PPR is responsible for the high CH4 yield. In contrast, even though the CO pathway dominated CO2 conversion on Ni is enhanced by rising H2/CO2 PPR, but at a high reaction temperature, the promoted CO desorption still leads to lower CH4 selectivity. This work offers deep insights into the direct air&#8208;level CO2 resourceization, contributing to the achievement of airborne CO2 reductions.

         <title>Sterically Hindered Derivatives of Pentacene and Octafluoropentacene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pentacene derivatives have been substituted with sterically bulky substituents (Tr*, tris(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl)methyl groups) appended to the ethynyl moieties in 6&#8208; and 13&#8208;positions and electron withdrawing fluorine groups in the pro&#8208;cata positions. The stability of acene derivatives toward endoperoxide formation has been evaluated in solution under ambient light and trends determined based steric and electronic characteristics of the substituents.







Abstract
6,13&#8208;Diethynylpentacene derivatives with sterically bulky substituents (Tr*, tris(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl)methyl groups) appended to the ethynyl moieties at the 6&#8208; and 13&#8208;positions have been synthesized, as well as derivatives with electron&#8208;withdrawing fluorine groups on the 1,2,3,4,8,9,10,11&#8208;positions. These molecules are designed to investigate relationships between steric and electronic effects on the stability of pentacene toward endoperoxide formation via reaction with photosensitized oxygen in solution under ambient light (i.&#8201;e., &#8216;laboratory&#8217; conditions). It is evident from the study that stabilization through changes to the electronic characteristics of pentacene are more effective than the incorporation of sterically bulky groups at the acetylenic termini. Selected pentacene derivatives have been made into binary, amorphous films with the fullerene derivative PCBM to investigate the stability imparted by substituents against cycloaddition reactions. Overall, the introduction of steric protection through the incorporation of Tr* groups is not an efficient strategy for enhancing the persistence of pentacenes. Stabilization through fluorination proves successful for extending the lifetime of the pentacene derivatives by an order of magnitude in solution. Notably, the persistence of pentacene derivatives in solution can also be enhanced through the use of ethereal solvents stabilized with butylated hydroxy toluene (BHT) and/or an increased number of trialkylsilyl groups as substituents.

         <title>Manganese(II)&#8208;Porphyrin and Cumyl Hydroperoxide: An Efficient Catalyst for Aryl&#8208;Pentazole C&#8211;N Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective cleavage of C&#8211;N bonds in N&#8208;containing compounds holds significant research value in organic synthesis, particularly for the synthesis of promising polynitrogen species. For instance, the discovery of the cyclo&#8208;pentazolate (cyclo&#8208;N5&#713;) anion in 2017 as a result of cleavage of the C&#8211;N bond has sparked interest within the field of high energy density materials. However, previous methods using ferrous glycinate and m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid generated the cyclo&#8208;N5&#713; anion in a low yield of 19.5% after 24 hours, and the mechanism remained unclear. In this study, we developed an efficient catalytic system comprising Mn (II) tetraphenylporphyrin and cumyl hydroperoxide. This system enables the cyclo&#8208;N5&#713; anion to be produced from 3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyphenylpentazole in 35.4% yield in 4 hours. Characterization of Mn(IV)&#8208;oxo porphyrins, &#8226;CH3, and &#8226;C8H8ON5 radicals provides evidence for the mechanism whereby the cyclo&#8208;N5&#713; anion forms. Our study underscores the competitive potential of radical&#8208;initiated selective C&#8211;N bonds cleavage in N&#8208;arylazoles and opens avenues for further exploration in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating the Topologies and Photoresponsive Properties of Lanthanum&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two lanthanum&#8208;organic frameworks with dinuclear lanthanum as building blocks and distinct bipyridinedicarboxylate as likers are prepared. Their structural differences result in the diversities of photoresponsive functionalities in terms of photochromism, photomodulated fluorescence and proton conductivity.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) show potential application in many domains, in which photochromic MOFs (PMOFs) have received enormous attention. Researchers mainly utilize photoactive ligands to build PMOFs. Recently, the mixed electron donating and accepting ligands strategies have also been used to construct PMOFs driven by the electron transfer between nonphotochromic moieties. However, the potential interligand competition inhibits the formation of PMOFs. Therefore, the exploration of single&#8208;ligand&#8208;guided assembly is conductive for building PMOFs. Considering the existing electron accepting and donating role of pyridyl and carboxyl, the pyridinecarboxyate derived from the fusion of pyridyl and carboxyl units may serve as single ligand to yield PMOFs (Figure&#8197;1d). In this work, the coordination assembly of bipyridinedicarboxylate (2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid, H2bpdc; 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;2,9&#8208;dicarboxylic acid, H2pda) and LaCl3 generate two PMOFs, [La(bpdc)(H2O)Cl] (1) and [La(pda)(H2O)2Cl]&#8901;2H2O (2). Both complexes feature dinuclear lanthanum as building blocks with differences in the connecting number of likers, in which 1 has (4,8)&#8208;connected topology and 2 exhibits sql topology. Their structural differences result in the diversities of photoresponsive functionalities. Compared with reported PMOFs built from photoactive ligands and mixed ligands, this study provides new available categories of single ligand for generating PMOFs and tuning the structure and photoresponsive properties via ligand substitution and external photostimulus.

&lt;p&gt;Two lanthanum-organic frameworks with dinuclear lanthanum as building blocks and distinct bipyridinedicarboxylate as likers are prepared. Their structural differences result in the diversities of photoresponsive functionalities in terms of photochromism, photomodulated fluorescence and proton conductivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) show potential application in many domains, in which photochromic MOFs (PMOFs) have received enormous attention. Researchers mainly utilize photoactive ligands to build PMOFs. Recently, the mixed electron donating and accepting ligands strategies have also been used to construct PMOFs driven by the electron transfer between nonphotochromic moieties. However, the potential interligand competition inhibits the formation of PMOFs. Therefore, the exploration of single-ligand-guided assembly is conductive for building PMOFs. Considering the existing electron accepting and donating role of pyridyl and carboxyl, the pyridinecarboxyate derived from the fusion of pyridyl and carboxyl units may serve as single ligand to yield PMOFs (Figure&#8197;1d). In this work, the coordination assembly of bipyridinedicarboxylate (2,2&#8242;-bipyridine-4,4&#8242;-dicarboxylic acid, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;bpdc; 1,10-phenanthroline-2,9-dicarboxylic acid, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;pda) and LaCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; generate two PMOFs, [La(bpdc)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)Cl] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and [La(pda)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl]&#8901;2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;). Both complexes feature dinuclear lanthanum as building blocks with differences in the connecting number of likers, in which &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; has (4,8)-connected topology and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; exhibits &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;sql&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; topology. Their structural differences result in the diversities of photoresponsive functionalities. Compared with reported PMOFs built from photoactive ligands and mixed ligands, this study provides new available categories of single ligand for generating PMOFs and tuning the structure and photoresponsive properties via ligand substitution and external photostimulus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Target Fisher: a Consensus Structure&#8208;Based Target Prediction Tool, and its Application in the Discovery of Selective MAO&#8208;B Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work we introduce Target Fisher, a consensus structure&#8208;based target prediction tool that integrates molecular docking and machine learning with the aim to aid in the identification of potential biological targets and the optimization of the use of bioassays. Target Fisher uses per&#8208;residue energy decomposition profiles extracted from docking poses as fingerprints to train target&#8208;specific machine learning models. It provides predictions for a curated set of 37 protein targets, covering a diverse range of biological entities, and offers a user&#8208;friendly interface accessible via a web server (https://gqc.quimica.unlp.edu.ar/targetfisher/). In this sense, Target Fisher is a valuable tool to aid organic and medicinal chemistry groups in target identification, drug discovery and drug repurposing. As a case study, we demonstrate the efficacy of Target Fisher by screening a small library of assorted natural products for targets relevant to neurodegenerative diseases, which resulted in the identification and experimental validation of selective inhibitors of monoamine oxidase B (MAO&#8208;B).</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Buckybowls, bowl&#8208;shaped polyaromatic hydrocarbons, have received intensive interest owing to their multifaceted potentials in supramolecular chemistry and materials science. Buckybowls possess unique chemical and physical properties associated with their concave and convex faces. In view of the shape complementarity, which is one of the key factors for host&#8208;guest assembly, buckybowls are ideal receptors for fullerenes. In fact, the host&#8208;guest assembly between buckybowls and fullerenes is one of the most active topics in buckybowls chemistry, and the resulting supramolecular materials show promising applications in optoelectronics, biomaterials, and so forth. In this tutorial review, we present an overview for the progress on fullerene receptors based on buckybowls over the last decade.</dc:description>

         <title>Elevating Nonlinear Optical Response through d&#8208;electron Modulation in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electronic structure and excited state behavior is of pronounced influence on regulation of nonlinear optical (NLO) response. Herein, a serials of transition metal ions bearing different d&#8208;electron numbers were in situ coordinated within porphyrinic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), creating NLO&#8208;responsive M&#8208;metal (metal = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) frameworks. It demonstrated that the NLO properties can be optimized with the increased occupancy of the d&#8208;shell, which enhances the degree of delocalization. Specifically, the full&#8208;filled (d10) electron configuration of Zn2+ stabilizes the electronic structure, combination with &#960;&#8208;&#960;* local excitation character of M&#8208;Zn, promoting charge transfer process and resulting in outstanding NLO properties. Moreover, parameters related to the nonlinear process (&#946;, n2, Im&#967;(3), Re&#967;(3) and &#967;(3)) of M&#8208;Zn are calculated to be higher than those of other materials, consistent with theoretical calculations. This work paves the way for NLO modulation based on electronic analysis and provides a promising approach for constructing high&#8208;performance NLO materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A CH4&#8208;Driven Ion Cloud&#8208;Stretched Approach Enables ICP&#8208;qMS for Multiplex Single&#8208;Cell Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the last 40 years, inductively coupled plasma quadrupole (q) mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;qMS) has been recognized as one of the best tools for the quantification of multiple elements/isotopes and even the biomolecules they labeled in a homogeneous solution sample. However, it meets a tough challenge when acquiring multi&#8208;m/z signals from an intact single&#8208;cell dispersed in a cell suspension, since the single&#8208;cell ion cloud generated in ICP presents an intermittently transient event with a duration time of hundreds of microseconds while the dwell time plus settling time of the q is at the similar time scale when peak&#8208;hopping between different m/z. Herein, we report CH4 is able to stretch the single&#8208;cell ion cloud duration time to more than 7,000 &#956;s in collision&#8208;reaction&#8208;cell (CRC), allowing multi&#8208;m/z signals acquisition by ICP&#8208;qMS. Quantification of single&#8208;cell's multiple phenotype protein markers can thus be achieved on ICP&#8208;(CH4&#8208;CRC)&#8208;qMS, not only revealing the heterogeneity between the single cells but also enabling an unambiguous cell&#8208;classification of their subtypes. CH4&#8208;driven ion cloud&#8208;stretched approach breaks through the long&#8208;standing bottleneck limited single&#8208;cell multiplex analysis on ICP&#8208;qMS, paving a path&#160;for more important applications of ICP&#8208;qMS in the fields related to single&#8208;cell analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoresponsive Dioxazaborocanes&#8208;Containing Oligomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new synthetic methodology for the preparation of photoresponsive oligomers containing dioxazaborocanes is developed from &#946;&#8208;aminodiols and a bis&#8208;borylated dithienylethene photochromic unit. Their photophysical properties are evaluated, as well as their suitability for the preparation of spin&#8208;coated films whose photomechanical behavior is assessed.







Abstract
The synthetic methodology for the preparation of photoresponsive dioxazaborocanes&#8208;containing oligomers is developed. It relies on the transformation of the (diisopropylamino)boryl group (&#8722;BH(NiPr2)) into a dioxazaborocane unit in the presence of &#946;&#8208;aminodiols and involves a bis&#8208;borylated dithienylethene photochromic unit. The photophysical properties of the obtained oligomers are evaluated as well as their processability for the preparation of spin&#8208;coated films. The photomechanical behavior of the resulting films is assessed via displacement tracking profile.

         <title>Synthesis, Reactivity, and Bonding Analysis of a Tetracoordinated Nickel Carbene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolation of a four&#8208;coordinate triphosphine nickel carbene complex challenges the generally accepted idea that low coordination numbers are required to stabilize M=C double bonds at late transition metal centers. The isolated compound displays nucleophilic and carbene&#8208;transfer reactivity. Computational analyses shed light on the unexpected role of the third phosphine in stabilizing the Ni=C fragment.







Abstract
Nickel carbenes are key reactive intermediates in the catalytic cyclopropanation of olefins and other reactions, but isolated examples are scarce and generally rely on low coordination numbers (&#8804;3) to stabilize the metal&#8722;ligand multiple bond. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a stable tetracoordinated nickel carbene bearing a triphosphine pincer ligand. Its nucleophilic character is evidenced by reaction with acids, and it can transfer the carbene fragment to CO to form a ketene. A computational study of the Ni=C chemical bond sheds light on the role of the third phosphine in the pincer framework to the stabilization of the nickel carbene fragment.

         <title>A Computational Study of Reactions with Boric Acid Aimed to Promote the Utilization of Lignin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The DFT calculation shows that control of the reaction of boric acid with hydroxide anion and the deprotonation of water clusters catalyzed by sodium cation are crucial to the reaction between lignin and boric acid under the alkaline condition.







Abstract
For exploring the reaction between the hydroxyl groups of lignin and boric acid under the alkaline condition, we study three proposed mechanisms for the formation of the anionic borate diester (ABDE) using the salicyl alcohol anion as the model compound by the density functional theory. ABDE has high flame retardancy and is a potentially practical application of lignin. The catalysis of sodium cation is found to enhance the deprotonation of the water cluster. The deprotonated product, hydroxide anion, is essential to the critical step, which is the cleavage of B&#8722;O bonds of the boric acid molecule, in reaction mechanisms. The energy profiles of the mechanisms show that the reaction between lignin and boric acid may start from the hydroxymethyl moieties of lignin since it requires less energy for the aforementioned critical step than from the phenol moieties of lignin. Moreover, the hydroxide anions compete with the hydroxymethyl groups in lignin for the formation of B&#8722;O bonds by forming tetrahydroxyborate anion (TBA) which requires very high activation energies to further react to the desired product ABDE. The optimal condition is to enhance the catalytic effect of sodium cations and meanwhile to control the formation of TBA.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Quantum Coherence of Reversible Photo&#8208;Generated Radical and its Film</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible photogenerated radicals 2,4,6&#8208;Tri(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (tpt) show a temperature&#8208;independent quantum coherence with Tm=1.1&#8197;&#956;s at 20&#8211;300&#8197;K and the Tm of tpt&#8208;film increased by two times at low temperature.







Abstract
Electron spin qubits are becoming an important research direction in the field of quantum computing and information storage. However, the quantum decoherence has seriously hindered the development of this field. So far, few qubits exhibit long phase memory time (Tm), and even fewer qubits that can reach room temperature. Some reports show that the coherence times of radicals are generally long, so radicals may be the preferred spin carriers for qubits. Here, we demonstrate the qubit properties of a photogenerated radical (1&#8201;a) based on 2,4,6&#8208;Tri(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (tpt, 1). More importantly, the photogenerated radical is a spin self&#8208;diluting complex, which the dilution is generally used in the investigation of qubits to reduce the interference of environment on qubits in order to overcome the decoherence of qubits. It is surprised that radical tpt has a stable Tm=1.1&#8197;&#956;s above 20&#8197;K, even keep it to room temperature. In addition, the tpt&#8208;film prepared by the vacuum evaporation is significantly increase the T1 and Tm at low temperature.

         <title>Photoinduced Metal&#8208;Free Decarboxylative Fluoroalkylation of Alkenes for the Synthesis of N&#8208;Arylbutanamides and Oxindoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new photoinduced decarboxylative difluoroalkylation&#8208;carbocyclization reaction of alkenes for the divergent construction of CF2&#8208;containing oxindoles and N&#8208;arylbutanamides was established. This photocatalysis reaction features simple conditions, transition metal photocatalysts free.







Abstract
The visible light&#8208;induced decarboxylative cascade reaction of fluoroalkyl carboxylic acids has been achieved for the efficient synthesis of fluorinated compounds. However, most of the transformations rely on noble iridium metal complex. Herein, a visible light&#8208;induced metal&#8208;free decarboxylative cascade reaction of fluoroalkyl carboxylic acids has been realized. This protocol features simple operation, transition metal free, and good functional group tolerance.

         <title>A Comparative Study of a High&#8208;Pressure Polymorph of I2O5 and its Ambient&#8208;Pressure Modification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature synthesis, crystal structure determination, and characterization of a new high&#8208;pressure modification of I2O5. The phase transition between the ambient&#8208; and high&#8208;pressure polymorph has been studied by temperature&#8208;dependent X&#8208;ray powder diffraction and volume&#8208;dependent DFT calculations.







Abstract
A hitherto unknown modification of I2O5 was obtained from high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature syntheses in a Walker&#8208;type multianvil device at 8&#8197;GPa and 250&#8201;&#176;C. HP&#8208;I2O5 crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system with space group P21/c (no.&#8197;14) with the unit cell parameters a=12.0612(3)&#8197;&#197;, b=4.8613(2)&#8197;&#197;, c=6.9585(2)&#8197;&#197;, &#946;=100.10(1)&#176; (at 173&#8197;K), and four formula units per cell. The single&#8208;crystal structure data are accompanied by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data at ambient and elevated temperatures. Furthermore, DFT calculations were carried out to investigate the phase transition between the ambient&#8208;pressure polymorph NP&#8208;I2O5 to the newly synthesized high&#8208;pressure phase.

         <title>Janus Reactivity of Crownphyrinoids: Alkali&#8208; vs. Transition Metal&#8208;Mediated Transformations of Crown Ether&#8208;Porphyrin Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual&#8208;nature cavities of crownphyrinoids enable reactivity at distinct porphyrinoid&#8208; or crown ether part of the macrocyclic ligand. Depending on the metal and oxidation level of the macrocycle, they bind cations, yielding monomeric, dimeric, or accordion&#8208;like complexes. The use of a crownphyrin capable of incorporating two metal centres allowed for obtaining heterobinuclear complexes wherein the macrocycle demonstrated the Janus reactivity.







Abstract
Crownphyrinogens and crownphyrins constitute a group of macrocycles that combine the structural facets of porphyrinoids and crown ethers. The dual&#8208;nature cavity embedded in their molecules enables reactivity involving two structurally distinct parts of the macrocyclic ligand. Upon Ni(II) and Pd(II) insertion, coordination compounds are produced wherein the metal is incorporated into the porphyrinoid&#8208;like pocket, resulting in monomeric or accordion&#8208;like dimeric products, depending on the oxidation level of the macrocycle and metal cation. The reactions with Na(I) and K(I) resulted in the formation of complexes where only the crown ether segment of the molecule is involved in metal binding, yielding remarkable dimeric species. The exploitation of a crownphyrin large enough to accommodate two metal cations allowed the synthesis of an alkali/transition metal binuclear complexes wherein the macrocycle demonstrated the Janus reactivity with one cavity acting as a porphyrinoid and the other mimicking the crown ether.

         <title>Consequences of the Pb&#8722;S Bond Formation for Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur radical used instead of the A cation in lead halide perovskites builds the Pb&#8722;S covalent bond, confirmed by the quantum theory of atoms in molecules and non&#8208;covalent interactions index. This bond triggers a phase transition to stable non&#8208;perovskite structure that hosts multiexcitons obeying the exciton&#8208;fission preconditions, according to an analysis derived from the Bethe&#8211;Salpeter equation.







Abstract
Lead halide perovskites are structurally not stable due to their ionic bonds. Using sulfur agents in the crystal growth improves the stability and performance of the photovoltaic and light&#8208;emitting devices. In this theoretical work, we use a small toy S&#8208;radical in place of A cation in the bulk of lead iodide perovskite, and highlight the significance of the Pb&#8722;S covalent&#8208;double&#8208;bond formation for: the charge redistribution on the neighboring bonds that also turn to be covalent, phase transformation to a stable non&#8208;perovskite structure, and superior optoelectronic properties. The chemical analysis was performed with the Quantum Theory of Atoms In Molecules (QTAIM) and Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions (NCI) index. Excitonic properties were obtained from the solution of ab initio Bethe&#8211;Salpeter equation. Presence of the spin&#8208;orbit coupling triggers an interplay between the Frenkel and charge&#8208;transfer multiexcitons, switching between the photovoltaic and laser applications. Multiexcitons obey the exciton&#8208;fission preconditions.

         <title>Synthesis of 4&#8208;(Phenylamino)quinazoline&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;thiones Using Green Solvents</title>

         <dc:description>
Environmentally friendly process for synthesizing heterocyclic molecules of therapeutic interest with the quinazoline&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;thione core structure, using bio&#8208;based recyclable solvents.







Abstract
Given the importance of quinazolines and quinazolinethiones in therapeutic and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#8208;approved molecules, we thought interesting to consider their synthesis in green solvents. We have shown that obtain 4&#8208;(arylamino)quinazoline&#8208;2&#8208;(1H)&#8208;thiones and 4&#8208;(arylamino)pteridine&#8208;2&#8208;(1H)&#8208;thiones analogues was efficient in green solvents derived from biomass, especially eucalyptol. Although reaction times are somewhat long to achieve good yields, the products were obtained by simple filtration. This considerably limited the loss of atoms due to the use of large quantities of solvents for purification on silica gel columns, and makes our route a sustainable one.

         <title>Achieving Regioselectivity for Remote C&#8722;H Activation by Substructure Conformations: an Approach of Paralogous Cytochrome P450 Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling regioselectivity in C&#8722;H activation is challenging, particularly for complex substrates. Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) offer a solution by modulating distance and geometry between the reaction center and target site. Comparative studies on homologous CYPs, such as IkaD and CftA, reveal that distinct substructure conformations can influence regioselectivity and have implications for CYP engineering.







Abstract
For advanced synthetic intermediates or natural products with multiple unactivated and energetically similar C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, controlling regioselectivity for the C&#8722;H activation is particularly challenging. The use of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) is a promising solution to the &#8216;regioelectivity&#8217; challenge in remote C&#8722;H activation. Notably, CYPs and organic catalysts share a fundamental principle: they strive to control the distance and geometry between the metal reaction center and the target C&#8722;H site. Most structural analyses of the regioselectivity of CYPs are limited to the active pocket, particularly when explaining why regioselectivity could be altered by enzyme engineering through mutagenesis. However, the substructures responsible for forming the active pocket in CYPs are well known to display complex dynamic changes and substrate&#8208;induced plasticity. In this context, we highlight a comparative study of the recently reported paralogous CYPs, IkaD and CftA, which achieve different regioselectivity towards the same substrate ikarugamycin by distinct substructure conformations. We propose that substructural conformation&#8208;controlled regioselectivity might also be present in CYPs of other natural product biosynthesis pathways, which should be considered when engineering CYPs for regioselective modifications.

         <title>Interdependent Dynamic Nitroaldol and Boronic Ester Reactions for Complex Dynamers of Different Topologies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic systems based on interdependent nitroaldol and boronate reactions have been demonstrated. Bifunctional building blocks led to mainchain nitroaldol&#8208;boronate dynamers as well as multi&#8208;dynamic networks with distinct topologies. The features of the dynamers were dependent on the boronic acid configuration.







Abstract
Complex dynamic systems displaying interdependency between nitroaldol and boronic ester reactions have been demonstrated. Nitroalkane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diols, generated by the nitroaldol reaction, were susceptible to ester formation with different boronic acids in aprotic solvents, whereas hydrolysis of the esters occurred in the presence of water. The boronic ester formation led to significant stabilization of the nitroaldol adducts under basic conditions. The use of bifunctional building blocks was furthermore established, allowing for main chain nitroaldol&#8208;boronate dynamers as well as complex network dynamers with distinct topologies. The shape and rigidity of the resulting dynamers showed an apparent dependency on the configuration of the boronic acids.

     alt="Interdependent Dynamic Nitroaldol and Boronic Ester Reactions for Complex Dynamers of Different Topologies"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamic systems based on interdependent nitroaldol and boronate reactions have been demonstrated. Bifunctional building blocks led to mainchain nitroaldol-boronate dynamers as well as multi-dynamic networks with distinct topologies. The features of the dynamers were dependent on the boronic acid configuration.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complex dynamic systems displaying interdependency between nitroaldol and boronic ester reactions have been demonstrated. Nitroalkane-1,3-diols, generated by the nitroaldol reaction, were susceptible to ester formation with different boronic acids in aprotic solvents, whereas hydrolysis of the esters occurred in the presence of water. The boronic ester formation led to significant stabilization of the nitroaldol adducts under basic conditions. The use of bifunctional building blocks was furthermore established, allowing for main chain nitroaldol-boronate dynamers as well as complex network dynamers with distinct topologies. The shape and rigidity of the resulting dynamers showed an apparent dependency on the configuration of the boronic acids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heterometallic [2]Catenane&#8208;Crosslinked Supramolecular Networks with Improved Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of supramolecular networks with novel crosslinks is of great significance in expanding their chemical structures and exploring their advanced functions. Herein, we prepare a type of [2]catenane&#8208;cored supramolecular networks based on the crosslinking of polyethylene glycol (PEG) using a heterometallic [2]catenane unit. By adjusting the molecular weight of PEG, the solubility of the networks can be tuned and gels are formed using low molecular weight PEG. The introduction of heterometallic [2]catenane offers the networks good antibacterial properties owing to the synergistic antimicrobial activity of Pt(II) and Cu(I) ions in the [2]catenane. This study provides a simple and efficient strategy for constructing supramolecular networks with topological crosslinks as antibacterial materials, which will promote the structural design and biological applications of supramolecular networks.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Oriented External Electric Field in Altering Magnetic Exchange and Magnetic Anisotropy in Lanthanide&#8208;Radical Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnetic exchange coupling (J) is one of the important spin Hamiltonian parameters that control the magnetic characteristics of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). While numerous chemical methodologies have been proposed to modify ligands and control the J value, and magneto&#8208;structural correlations have been developed accordingly, altering this parameter through non&#8208;chemical means remains a challenging task. This study explores the impact of an Oriented&#8208;External Electric Field (OEEF) on over twenty lanthanide&#8208;radical complexes using Density Functional Theory (DFT) and ab initio Complete Active Space Self&#8208;Consistent Field (CASSCF) methods. Five complexes&#8212;[{(Me3Si)2N]2Gd(THF)}2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;N2)] (1), [Gd(Hbpz3)2(dtbsq)] (2), [Gd(hfac)3(IM&#8208;2py)] (3), [Gd(hfac)3(NITBzImH)] (4), and [Gd(hfac)3{2Py&#8208;NO}(H2O)] (5)&#8212;were selected for detailed analysis, revealing significant OEEF effects on magnetic exchange interactions and structural parameters. Various parameters such as bond distances, bond angles, and torsional angles were examined as a function of OEEF to establish guiding principles for molecule selection. In complexes 1, 2, and 3, OEEF influenced torsional angles and altered exchange interactions. Complex 4 demonstrated enhanced ferromagnetic coupling under OEEF, reaching a maximum J value of +5.3 cm&#8722;1. Complex 5 reveals switching the sign of JGd&#8208;rad exchange interaction from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic under OEEF, highlighting the potential of electric fields in designing materials with tuneable magnetic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Hollow Superhelices Based on Chiral Europium Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of helical nanotubes based on chiral coordination polymers (CPs) is an intriguing but challenging task, which is important for the development of functional materials that combine macroscopic chirality with tube&#8208;related properties. Here, we selected a chiral europium phosphonate system, e.g., Eu(NO3)3/R&#8208;,S&#8208;pempH2, and carried out a systematic work. By controlling the hydrothermal reaction conditions such as the pH value of the reaction mixture, the molar ratio and concentration of the reactants, we obtained block&#8208;like crystals of R/S&#8208;1b, rod&#8208;like crystals ofR/S&#8208;3r, hollow superhelices of R/S&#8208;2hh, and solid superhelices of R/S&#8208;4sh. In the latter two cases, the chirality has been successfully transferred and amplificated from the molecular level to the macroscopic level. Interestingly, compounds R/S&#8208;2hh and R/S&#8208;4sh have the same chemical composition of Eu(R/S&#8208;pempH)3&#215;2H2O and show identical PXRD patterns, thus can be considered as the same material except for different morphologies. We further investigated&#160;their circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties and found that the hollow superhelix of R/S&#8208;2hh had a larger dissymmetry factor than the solid superhelix of R/S&#8208;4sh. This study not only provides the first example of hollow superhelices of chiral CPs, but also offers the possibility of modulating the chiroptical properties of CPs through morphological control.</dc:description>

         <title>Air and Water Stable Bicyclic (Alkyl)(Amino)Carbene Stabilized Phosphenium Cation: Reactivity and Selective Fluoride Ion Affinity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we present the synthesis and reactivity of the BICAAC&#8208;stabilized phosphenium cation, which is air and moisture stable and exhibits selective fluoride binding.







Abstract
The synthesis and reactivity of an air and water stable Bicyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (BICAAC) stabilized phosphenium cation (1) is reported. Air and water stable phosphenium cation are rare in the literature. Compound 1 is obtained by reaction of BICAAC with Ph2PCl in THF followed by anion exchange with LiOTf. The reduction and oxidation of 1 yielded corresponding &#945;&#8208;radical phosphine species (2) and BICAAC stabilized phosphenium oxide (3) respectively. All compounds are well characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. The Lewis acidity of compounds 1 and 3 are determined by conducting fluoride ion affinity experiments using UV&#8208;Vis spectrophotometry and multinuclei NMR spectroscopy. Compounds 1 and 3 exhibited selective binding to fluoride anion but did not interact with other halides (Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722;). Quantum chemical calculations were performed to understand the structure and nature of bonding interactions in these compounds, as well as to comprehend the specific bonding affinity to fluoride over other halide ions.

         <title>Pd/C&#8211;Catalyzed Selective N&#8208;Monomethylation by Transfer Hydrogenation of Urea Derivatives using Methanol as H2 and C1 Sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective commercially available carbon supported palladium (Pd/C)&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;monomethylation of Urea derivatives is achieved using Methanol as both a hydrogen (H2) and methyl (C1) Source. This one&#8208;pot synthetic methodology presents an alternative route for the synthesis of mono&#8208;methylated amines from urea derivatives via transfer hydrogenation.







Abstract
N&#8208;monomethyl amines are useful intermediates in drugs, natural products, paints. Yet their synthesis is a tremendous challenge due to their high reactivity, typically leading to overmethylation. In this contribution, a highly selective catalytic N&#8208;methylation methodology is reported, converting urea derivatives to monomethylated amines, using a commercially available heterogeneous Pd/C catalyst and methanol as unique reagent. Methanol provides a sustainable alternative protocol for the selective preparation of mono&#8208;methylated derivatives as it acts as both H2 and C1 sources. In addition, several control experiments were performed to provide a proposal for the mechanism, namely dehydrogenation of methanol and subsequent hydrogenation of urea derivatives, followed by reduction of the in&#8197;situ formed methyl imine. Importantly, the approach is simple, highly productive and enables novel synthetic procedures for the preparation of monomethylamines from urea derivatives.

         <title>N2H4 Derived Sulfonic Acids: Hydrazine Disulfonate, [(SO3)HNNH(SO3)]2&#8722;, and Hydrazine Iso&#8208;disulfonate, [H2NN(SO3)2]2&#8722;</title>

Insertion of SO3 molecules into the N&#8722;H bonds of hydrazine, N2H4 lead to the hydrazine disulfonate [(SO3)HNNH(SO3)]2&#8722; and the hydrazine iso&#8208;disulfonate, [H2NN(SO3)2]2&#8722; anion, respectively. The salts of these new anions have been characterized comprehensively, including thermal analyses, Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations.







Abstract
The reaction of hydrazinium sulfate and chlorosulfonic acid in pyridine leads to the pyridinium salt of the hydrazine disulfonate anion, [(SO3)HNNH(SO3)]2&#8722;. The salt is the starting material for the preparation of further hydrazine disulfonates, for example of alkaline metals and barium. In all compounds, the [(SO3)HNNH(SO3)]2&#8722; anion adopts the gauche conformation. The conformer is chiral but all of the investigated compounds crystallize as racemates. The disulfonate anion can occur in another constitution with the two sulfonate groups attached to only one nitrogen atom. This so&#8208;called hydrazine iso&#8208;disulfonate, [H2NN(SO3)2]2&#8722;, has been prepared through a substitution reaction between potassium imidodisulfonate, K2[HN(SO3)2], and hydroxylamine&#8208;O&#8208;sulfonic acid, H2NOSO3H. The hydrazine iso&#8208;disulfonate anion has been crystallized as potassium and barium compound, respectively. The compounds were characterized by XRD, vibrational spectroscopy, DFT calculations and thermal analyses.

         <title>Conformation Regulation of Trisresorcinarene Directed by Cavity Solvation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trisresorcinarene is a synthetic macrocycle comprising three resorcinarene units covalently connected by odd&#8208;numbered alkyl chains. This macrocycle can adopt two conformers (open and closed forms), and their relative populations are influenced by the solvent.







Abstract
This compound is a synthetic macrocycle comprising three pivaloyl&#8208;protected resorcinarene units connected by six pentylene chains. We conducted a conformational study using 1H&#8208;NMR, X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and computational analyses. The macrocycle adopts two conformers, one open, the other closed. The ratio of the open to closed forms depended on the solvent used. Only the open form existed in [D8]toluene, both forms coexisted in [D6]benzene, and the closed form was the major conformer in [D1]chloroform. The benzene&#8208;solvated open form observed in the solid state suggests that cavity solvation by solvent molecules directs the open form. The open form was the major or only conformer in [D10]o&#8208; and [D10]m&#8208;xylene and [D12]mesitylene, whereas the closed form was the major conformer in [D6]acetone. The open and closed forms were equally populated in [D10]p&#8208;xylene, suggesting that the size, shape, and dimensions of the solvent molecules most likely influenced the conformation of the protected trisresocinarene.

         <title>An Ultrahigh Affinity DNA Aptamer for Quinine and Its Intrinsic Fluorescence Based Label&#8208;free Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Measuring quinine is critical for the detection of its overdose, understanding its pharmacological and toxicological effects, and monitoring its pollution. While a previously reported aptamer named MN4 can bind quinine, it was not selected for it, leading to compromised binding affinity and specificity. In this work, a new quinine aptamer was isolated using the library immobilization capture&#8208;SELEX technique. The Q1 aptamer has a Kd value of 10 nM determined by an isothermal titration calorimetry experiment and 45 nM in a fluorescence binding assay. A 3.5 nM quinine limit of detection was obtained based on the aptamer binding&#8208;induced quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of quinine. A large blue shift in fluorescence was observed for quinine upon binding to Q1, whereas binding to MN4 led to a very small red shift, indicating different ways of quinine binding by these two aptamers. Q1 did not bind cocaine based on NMR spectroscopy and fluorescence assays also indicated excellent selectivity against other tested molecules. This work has supplied a high affinity aptamer for quinine that can be useful for its detection and fundamental aptamer binding studies. It also highlights the advantages of using capture&#8208;SELEX to isolate aptamers for small molecules.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Glassy organic dots (g&#8208;Odots) are an emerging class of luminescent nanoparticles that offer enhanced photostability, superior brightness, and modular tunability compared to other commonly employed nanoparticles. In the last several years, they have been used as bioimaging probes for single&#8208; and multi&#8208;photon cellular imaging, exhibiting low cytotoxicity even after several days. While they are emerging as promising materials for use in biological applications, g&#8208;Odots face several key challenges before their use can become widespread. In this concept, we outline the state of the literature on g&#8208;Odots and highlight a few ways in which their design and use can be improved upon.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of Advanced Microscopy Techniques to The Characterization of Mixed Matrix Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) have emerged as promising materials for various separation processes due to their tunable properties, enhanced separation performance and reproducibility. In this review paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the methodologies, challenges, and applications associated with the characterization of MMMs using two advanced imaging techniques: Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB&#8208;SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). We begin by outlining the principles and capabilities of FIB&#8208;SEM and TEM, emphasizing their suitability for studying the microstructure, morphology, and composition of MMMs at nanoscale resolution. Subsequently, we discuss the specific challenges and limitations encountered in the characterization of MMMs using these techniques, including sample preparation, image acquisition, and data interpretation. Furthermore, we review the diverse applications of FIB&#8208;SEM and TEM in elucidating the structure&#8208;property relationships of MMMs. Through illustrative examples, we highlight the valuable insights gained from these imaging techniques in optimizing MMMs for various separation applications. Finally, we propose future directions and emerging trends in MMM characterization, including the integration of lasers into FIB&#8208;SEM and in situ characterization techniques, to address current challenges and push the boundaries of MMM design and performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of a Fluorinated&#8208;Anion Pillared Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Exhibiting Dual&#8208;Pore Architecture for Simultaneous Enhancement of C2H2 Adsorption Capacity and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Physisorption&#8208;based separation processes represents a promising alternative to the conventional thermally driven methods, such as cryogenic separation. However, a significant challenge lies in balancing the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and selectivity of adsorbents. In this study, we introduce a novel fluorinated&#8208;anion pillared metal&#8208;organic frameworks (APMOFs) featuring a dual&#8208;pore architecture, constructed using a pyridine&#8208;oxazole bifunctional ligand. The inherent low symmetry of the ligand leads to significant distortion of the fluorinated&#8208;anion pillars, resulting in a distinctive type of APMOFs characterized by dual&#8208;pore architecture. On pore structure with constrict pore width is enriched with a high density of anion fluorinated pillars, offering numerous active sites advantageous for enhancing separation selectivity. Concurrently, the other pore structure exhibits larger dimensions, facilitating increased gas molecule accommodation and thereby augmenting adsorption capacity.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Physisorption-based separation processes represents a promising alternative to the conventional thermally driven methods, such as cryogenic separation. However, a significant challenge lies in balancing the trade-off between adsorption capacity and selectivity of adsorbents. In this study, we introduce a novel fluorinated-anion pillared metal-organic frameworks (APMOFs) featuring a dual-pore architecture, constructed using a pyridine-oxazole bifunctional ligand. The inherent low symmetry of the ligand leads to significant distortion of the fluorinated-anion pillars, resulting in a distinctive type of APMOFs characterized by dual-pore architecture. On pore structure with constrict pore width is enriched with a high density of anion fluorinated pillars, offering numerous active sites advantageous for enhancing separation selectivity. Concurrently, the other pore structure exhibits larger dimensions, facilitating increased gas molecule accommodation and thereby augmenting adsorption capacity. Gas sorption studies reveal a substantial C2H2 adsorption capacity and a high C2H2/CO2 separation selectivity. Breakthrough experiments confirm its exceptional separation performance, while theoretical investigations elucidate a sequential adsorption process within these APMOFs, underscoring the efficacy of this strategy in overcoming trade-off limits in adsorbents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Osmapentalenofurans Constructed by Reacting Os&#8801;C1 of Osmapentalyne with Phenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article presents the efficient synthesis of osmapentalenofurans via the reaction of osmapentalyne containing Os&#8801;C1 with phenols, resulting in complexes with near&#8208;infrared luminescence. The TPE&#8208;derived osmapentalenofuran showed remarkable AIE properties, expanding the reactivity of these compounds and highlighting their potential in specialized functional materials and advanced luminescent applications.







Abstract
Over the past decade, significant research efforts have focused on osmapentalyne, characterized by the more reactive Os&#8801;C7 (Carbon atoms numbered in a clockwise direction on the osmapentalyne skeleton), across areas encompassing electrophilic, nucleophilic, and addition reactions. Nevertheless, the reactivity of osmapentalyne featuring Os&#8801;C1 remains ripe for further exploration. In this investigation, we effectively synthesized a lineage of osmapentalenofurans through the nucleophilic reaction of osmapentalyne incorporating Os&#8801;C1 with phenols. These resulting complexes demonstrate near&#8208;infrared luminescence traits in both solid and liquid states. Particularly noteworthy is the osmapentalenofuran derived from tetraphenylethane (TPE) unit, which showcases remarkable aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property in the aggregated state. These osmapentalenofurans are also able to further extend their range of reactions, including reactions with base and isonitrile. This study not only broadens the scope of applications for metal aromatics but also furnishes valuable insights into the realm of specialized functional materials.

         <title>Chiral Amphiphilic Au23 Cluster and Its Specific Recognition to Remote Di&#8208;amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrophility, amphiphilicity, chirality, thermostability, luminescence intensity and circularly polarized luminescence properties of the [Au23(CHT)16]&#8722; has been greatly improved after incorporating the captopril ligands, which further endows the clusters with specific recognizing capacity to remote di&#8208;amine structures such as Arg, Cys, and DNA strands. Chiral Amphiphilic Au23 Cluster and Its Specific Recognition to Remote Di&#8208;amines.







Abstract
The atomic precision of metal nanoclusters and variability of surface ligands pave the way for their rational design and functionalization, whereas the property strengthening in multiple ways has been long challenging. Herein, improved amphiphilicity, chirality, thermostability, and strong CPL (circularly polarized luminescence) properties have been accomplished by facile ligand exchange of [Au23(CHT)16]&#8722; with HCapt (HCHT and HCapt denote cyclohexanethiol and captopril). In addition, the obtained chiral [Au23(SR)16]&#8722; (short for [Au23(CHT)16&#8208;x(Capt)x]&#8722;) clusters show specific binding affinity to remote&#8208;diamines (such as arginine and single/double strand DNA), originating from the hydrogen bonding and Van der Waals interaction among the surface Capt ligands and the di&#8208;amine groups.

         <title>Comparative analysis of tetravalent actinide Schiff base complexes: influence of donor and ligand backbone on molecular geometry and metal binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of isostructural early actinide AnIV complexes was synthesized in order to investigate the influence of a conjugated framework in the ligand backbone on An bonding. Therefore, the AnIV complexes [An(pyrophen)2] (An = Th, U, Np, and Pu) with the pure N&#8208;donor ligand bis(2&#8208;pyrrolecarbonylaldehyde)&#8208;o&#8208;phenylenediamine referred to as pyrophen, were synthesized and characterized. Solid state analysis via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD) reveals two sets of ligands binding in an almost orthogonal arrangement to the actinide center. For the larger actinides Th and U, the coordination sphere allows for additional coordination by a solvent molecule. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) studies show the presence of highly symmetrical complexes in solution in good agreement with the solvent&#8208;free solid structures. While SC&#8208;XRD suggests mainly ionic binding, an analysis of paramagnetic NMR contributions and quantum chemical bond analysis hint towards significant covalency in the U, Np, and Pu compounds. This series of An complexes allowed for a thorough structural and theoretical comparison of a conjugated system to a closely related N&#8208;donor ligand (pyren)[1], as well as to the mixed N,O Schiff base ligands salophen (conjugated) and salen (non&#8208;conjugated).</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Pnictogen and Ligand Framework on the Lewis Acidity and Steric Environment in Pnictogen Pincer Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pnictogen pincer complexes are a fascinating class of compounds due to their dynamic molecular and electronic structures, and valuable stoichiometric or catalytic reactivity. As recognition of their unique chemistry has grown, so too has the library of pincer ligands employed and pnictogen centres engaged to prepare them. Here we computationally study how the choice of pincer ligand framework and pnictogen influence the electronic and steric outcomes of the complexes obtained. The most relevant electronic parameter is the pnictogen&#8208;centred electrophilicity, which has been quantified by fluoride ion affinities and LUMO energies, while the most relevant steric parameter is the crowding around the central pnictogen, which has been quantified by the %Vbur values and visualized using steric maps. The resulting trends are analyzed with reference to binding pocket size, acceptor orbital type, electronic delocalization, &#960;&#8208;donor strengths, and heteroatom incorporation. Thus, considering 16 ligand frameworks and 4 heavy pnictogen centres, this study provides a broad&#8208;spectrum view of stereo&#8208;electronic variation in pnictogen pincer complexes, which, together with a recent study on geometric variation in the same family, provides a substantial dataset to guide future molecular design and reactivity studies.</dc:description>

         <title>PnictogenIII&#160;Dications Supported by BZIMPY Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two homologous series of pnictogen(III) dications, stabilized by 2,6&#8208;bis(benzimidazole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine ligands have been prepared. Both series contain PnIII&#8722;X moieties (Pn = P, As, Sb, Bi; X = Cl or Ph) and have been fully characterized using spectroscopic methods including X&#8208;ray crystallography. The Lewis acidity of these compounds has also been probed by computational methods; the results suggest that the dictations are strong Lewis acids, with the PnCl2+ compounds being more acidic than the PnPh2+ compounds, and with Lewis acidity increasing from P to Bi, in both series. The PhP2+&#8208;containing compound was also found to be a versatile PIII transfer reagent, leading to new synthetic routes for various PhP&#8208;containing compounds. The redox chemistry of all compounds has also been probed using cyclic voltammetry and chemical reductions.

Both series contain PnIII&#8722;X moieties (Pn = P, As, Sb, Bi; X = Cl or Ph) and have been fully characterized using spectroscopic methods including X-ray crystallography. The Lewis acidity of these compounds has also been probed by computational methods; the results suggest that the dictations are strong Lewis acids, with the PnCl2+ compounds being more acidic than the PnPh2+ compounds, and with Lewis acidity increasing from P to Bi, in both series. The PhP2+-containing compound was also found to be a versatile PIII transfer reagent, leading to new synthetic routes for various PhP-containing compounds. The redox chemistry of all compounds has also been probed using cyclic voltammetry and chemical reductions. In some cases the resulting PnI moieties could be trapped using diazabutadienes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strategies and Applications for Supramolecular Protein Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular hierarchical protein self&#8208;assembly is vital for constructing diverse and functional biomaterials, as well as to explore information exchange and cooperation between proteins. In this paper, the classical supramolecular protein assembly construction strategies and the flexible regulaion of assemblies are summarized and analyzed. In addition, the applications and the enormous potential and significance of supramolecular protein materials are also reviewed.







Abstract
Supramolecular chemistry achieves higher&#8208;order molecular self&#8208;assembly through non&#8208;covalent interactions. Utilizing supramolecular methods to explore the polymorphism of proteins, the building blocks of life, from a &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; perspective is essential for constructing diverse and functional biomaterials. In recent years, significant progress has been achieved in the design strategies and functional applications of supramolecular protein self&#8208;assembly, becoming a focal point for researchers. This paper reviews classical supramolecular strategies driving protein self&#8208;assembly, including electrostatic interactions, metal coordination, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, host&#8208;guest interactions, and other mechanisms. We discuss how these supramolecular interactions regulate protein assembly processes and highlight protein supramolecular assemblies&#8242; unique structural and functional advantages in constructing artificial photosynthetic systems, protein hydrogels, bio&#8208;delivery systems, and other functional materials. The enormous potential and significance of supramolecular protein materials are elucidated. Finally, the challenges in preparing and applying protein supramolecular assemblies are summarized, and future development directions are projected.

         <title>C(sp2)&#8208;Arylsulfones Directly from Arylsulfonyl Chlorides with Boronic Acids by Photoactivation of Boosted EDA Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Directly with arylsulfonyl chlorides, a green and efficient deborylativesulfonylation of aryl(alkenyl)boronic acids has been developed to access both diarylsulfones and vinylarylsulfones in moderate to excellent yields at room temperature under visible&#8208;light irradiation. This protocol features broad C(sp2)&#8208;arylsulfone applicability, simple operation, accessibility of raw materials and ease of scale&#8208;up. The key to the success of this photoredox transformation is introducing catalytic amounts of additives, naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ols, thus boosting the formed electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes, which can dramatically improve not only the reaction efficiency but also the selectivity. This strategy&#160;was inspired and derived from specific substrates, representing a rare paradigm of how to exploit a more general reaction system. Moreover, extensive control experiments provide insights into the proposed mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>A Sodium Metal&#8722;Organic Framework with Deep Blue Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is a great challenge to manufacture room&#8208;temperature blue long afterglow phosphorescent materials adapted to environmental conditions. Herein, an Na&#8208;based metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) was constructed using Na+ and 1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;3,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid, which exhibits long&#8208;lived of 378.9 ms, deep blue and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence, meanwhile possesses the visible blue afterglow for 3~6 seconds after removing excitation light source. The three&#8208;dimensional coordination bonds network provided by Na&#8208;based MOF protects the organic ligands intrinsic hydrogen bond network, resulting in the phosphor lifetime and residual color remaining unchanged in different gas atmospheres. Furthermore, first&#8208;principles time&#8208;dependent density functional theory reveals that the rigid Na&#8208;based MOF structure can limit the rotation and vibration of the room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent organic ligands. This limitation results in the suppression of non&#8208;radiative decay for both singlet and triplet excitons, promotes intersystem crossing, and increases the rate of radiative decay, ultimately achieving long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulatory Mechanisms and Synergistic Enhancement of the Diiron YtfE Protein in Nitric Oxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The diiron&#8208;containing YtfE protein in Escherichia coli is pivotal in counteracting nitrosative stress, a critical barrier to bacterial viability. This study delves into the biochemical complexity governing YtfE's conversion of nitric oxide (NO) to nitrous oxide, a key process for alleviating nitrosative stress. Through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, we explored YtfE's molecular structure, with a particular focus on two internal transport tunnels important for its activity. Our findings illuminate Tunnel 1 as the primary conduit for substrate transport, regulated by conformational shifts within the N&#8208;terminal domain that enable substrate access to the diiron core in the C&#8208;terminal domain. Tunnel 2 emerges as a secondary, supportive route, activated when Tunnel 1 is compromised. This result challenges a previous model of distinct tunnels for substrate entry and product exit, suggesting both tunnels are capable of transporting substrates and products. Our engineering efforts enhanced the role of Tunnel 2, enabling a synergistic operation with Tunnel 1 and tripling YtfE's enzymatic activity compared to its wild&#8208;type form. This research not only deepens our understanding of YtfE&#8217;s regulatory mechanism for NO reduction but also introduces a strategy to amplify its enzymatic efficiency. The outcomes offer new ravenues for modulating bacterial stress responses.</dc:description>

         <title>Physicochemical Analysis of Cu(II)&#8208;Driven Electrochemical CO2 Reduction and its Competition with Proton Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reduction of CO2 has become a key role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in efforts to search for long&#8208;term responses to climate change. We report a a couple of CO2&#8208;reducing molecular catalysts based on earth&#8208;abundant copper complexes.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The reduction of CO2 has become a key role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in efforts to search for long-term responses to climate change. We report a a couple of CO2-reducing molecular catalysts based on earth-abundant copper complexes. These are [Cu(DPA)(PyNAP)] (1) and [Cu(DPA)(PyQl)] (2) (where, DPA = pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, PyNAP = 2-(pyridin-2-yl)-1,8-naphthyridine, and PyQl = 2-(pyridin-2-yl)quinoline). The copper metal-catalysed 2-electron reduction of CO2 to CO in the presence of 2-protons is challenging. These catalysts exhibit the production of CO gas in DMF/water mixtures, achieving an impressive faradaic efficiency of&#160; 84% and 72% for complex 1 and 2 at -1.7 V vs. SCE, respectively, for selective CO2 reduction. The production of H2 due to 2H+ + 2e- was also observed as a byproduct through the competitive proton reduction reaction.

         <title>Steric Engineering of Rotaxane Catalysts: Benefits and Limits of Using the Mechanical Bond in Catalyst Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a series of BINOL based catalysts in which the number of interlocked macrocycles is varied. The thread, [2]rotaxane and [3]rotaxane show a drastically different behavior in catalysis. In enantioselective transformations, the interlocked macrocycles are detrimental to stereoselectivity whereas in lactide polymerization, they increase the molecular weight of the polymer.







Abstract
The mechanical bond is emerging as a novel design element in catalyst development. Here, we report a series of 1,1&#8217;&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;diol (BINOL) based catalysts in which the number of interlocked macrocycles is varied. Unsurprisingly, the macrocycles have a profound steric influence on the catalytic performance of these molecules. However, in the enantioselective transformations examined, the macrocycles are detrimental to catalyst stereoselectivity whereas in lactide polymerization, they increase the molecular weight of the polymeric product.

         <title>From Double&#8208;Stranded Helicates to Abiotic Double Helical Supramolecular Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The folding of oligomeric strands is the method that nature has selected to generate ordered assemblies presenting spectacular functions. In the purpose to mimic these biomacro&#8208;molecules and extend their properties and functions, chemists make important efforts to prepare artificial secondary, tertiary, and even quarternary structures based on folded abiotic backbones. A large variety of oligomers and polymers, encoded with chemical informations, were designed, synthesized and characterized, and the establishment of non&#8208;covalent interactions lead to complex and functional supramolecular architectures resulting from a spontaneous self&#8208;assembly process. The association of comple&#8208;mentary molecular strands into double helical structures is a common structural pattern of nucleic acids and proteins, so the synthesis of bio&#8208;inspired double helices has emerged as an important subject. In recent years, a number of synthetic oligo&#8208;mers have been reported to form stable double helices and it was shown that the equilibrium between single and double helices can be controlled via different stimuli like the modification of the solvent or the temperature. This kind of structure presents highly interesting functions, such as molecular recognition within the cavity of double helices, and some other potential applications will emerge in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental and computational studies of steric factors in the isomerization of internal alkynes within the coordination environment of half&#8208;sandwich metal complexes</title>

         <dc:description>The isomerization of internal alkynes Ar1C&#8801;CAr2 within the coordination environment of low&#8208;valent half&#8208;sandwich [Ru(dppe)Cp]+ complexes via a 1,2&#8208;migration process affords vinylidene species [Ru{=C=C(Ar1)Ar2}(dppe)Cp]+. The rearrangement reactions of symmetrically and asymmetrically substituted substrates featuring different electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing groups and of varying steric bulk were modelled using density functional theory (DFT), and the conclusions supported by experimental observations. Examination of the reaction pathway and associated activation barriers reveal a high solvent dependency for the generation of the key intermediate species [Ru(dppe)Cp]+ from [RuCl(dppe)Cp] by Na+ induced halide abstraction , with the lattice enthalpy of the NaCl by&#8208;product playing a critical role in the overall thermochemical balance of the reaction. The activation barriers associated with the reaction of [Ru(dppe)Cp]+ with Ar1C&#8801;CAr2, and the relative energies of the alkyne complexes [Ru(h2&#8208;Ar1C&#8801;CAr2)(dppe)Cp]+, are sensitive to the electron density of the alkyne and conformational changes associated with the &#8216;bend&#8208;back&#8217; of the substrate. The latter differs by up to 66.1 kJ/mol, which in turn impacts the barrier height of the subsequent 1,2&#8208;migration step . The relative importance of these factors is evinced by the successful rearrangement of the very sterically congested 1(9&#8208;anthryl)&#8208;2(9&#8208;phenanthryl) acetylene into the fully characterized diaryl vinylidene complex, which was isolated in 89% yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Hydrogenation of an Insulated Diarylacetylene Dimer Incorporated as Axle Molecules in a Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based [c2]Daisy Chain Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The [c2]daisy chain rotaxane is an attractive interlocked molecule for the development of functional materials because of its unique mechanical properties that respond to various external stimuli, resulting in extension and contraction motions along the molecular axis. The synthesis of several &#8216;impossible&#8217; [2]rotaxanes that do not exhibit obvious binding motifs between their axle and wheel moieties has been achieved through further chemical modification of their axle moieties within pre&#8208;prepared [2]rotaxanes. However, no &#8216;impossible&#8217; [c2]daisy chain rotaxane has been synthesized using similar strategies until now. In this study, we investigated the hydrogenation of diarylacetylene moieties within a permethylated &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (PM &#945;&#8208;CD)&#8208;based [c2]daisy chain rotaxane using Pd/C or Pd/CaCO3 under hydrogen. A new [c2]daisy chain rotaxane featuring two diarylethane moieties was successfully synthesized through the simultaneous full hydrogenation of the insulated diarylacetylene moieties under optimized conditions. The new rotaxane is classified as an &#8216;impossible&#8217; [c2]daisy chain rotaxane due to the lack of obvious binding motifs between diarylethane and the PM &#945;&#8208;CD. This work demonstrates for the first time that the insulated axle moieties of [c2]daisy chain rotaxanes can undergo novel chemical modifications using a synthetic strategy employing transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation, which can potentially advance the development of nanoarchitectures with functional interlocked molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Pure Shift NMR in Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flow NMR is an expanding analytical approach with applications that include in&#8208;line analysis for process control and optimisation, and real&#8208;time reaction monitoring. The samples monitored by flow NMR are typically mixtures that yield complex 1D&#160;1H spectra. &#8220;Pure shift&#8221; NMR is a powerful approach to simplifying&#160;1H NMR spectra, but its standard implementation is not compatible with continuous flow because of interference between sample motion and the position&#8208;dependent spin manipulations that are required in pure shift NMR. Here we show that pure shift NMR spectra can be successfully collected for continuously flowing samples, thanks to an adapted acquisition scheme, robust solvent suppression, and a velocity&#8208;compensation strategy. The resulting method is used to collect ultrahigh resolution reaction monitoring data. Pure shift NMR spectra are expected to benefit many applications of flow NMR.</dc:description>

         <title>Syn vs. Anti? What Controls Addition Stereochemistry in Chlorolactonization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stereochemistry of the uncatalyzed chlorolactonization of 4&#8208;phenylpent&#8208;4&#8208;enoic acid at room temperature was examined to probe the reaction&#8217;s intrinsic diastereoselectivities as a function of chlorenium ion donor, solvent polarity, and reactant concentration ranges. Kinetic studies using Variable Time Normalization Analysis (VTNA) revealed differing reaction orders for the syn and anti alkene addition processes. Aided and illustrated by quantum chemical modeling, this detailed mechanistic analysis of the substrate&#8217;s intrinsic chlorolactonization reactions points to concerted AdE3&#8208;type paths for both syn and anti additions. By illuminating the factors selecting for syn&#8208; vs anti&#8208;addition paths, the results provide key reference points for future studies of stereocontrol in halofunctionalization reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Emergent Behavior of a Photoswitchable Solute in a Biphasic Solvent System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to thermal E/Z isomerization, hydrazones in solution typically exist in thermodynamic equilibria between their isomers. Irradiation of such solutions leads to photostationary states that may differ from the equilibrium distribution. Operating such switchable hydrazones in a biphasic system of two immiscible solvents introduces three new degrees of freedom: the E/Z equilibrium in the second solvent and two equilibria for distribution of each of the isomers between the solvents. Irradiation of such a system can be performed in three different ways &#8211; the first solvent only, the second solvent only, and both solvents at once &#8211; all yielding distinct outcomes. Depending on the choice of materials and the mode of irradiation, such setup may lead to different emergent behaviors that are not immediately intuitive, including net cyclic transport or the accumulation of one photoswitched product in one of the phases, beyond what is reachable by irradiating a simple solution of the same photoswitch.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulation of Supramolecular Chirality in Bicontinuous Networks of Bent&#8208;Shaped Polycatenar &#160;Dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bicontinuous cubic liquid crystalline (LC) phases are of particular interest due their possible applications in electronic devices and special supramolecular chirality. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of first examples of achiral bent&#8208;shaped polycatenar dimers, capable of displaying mirror symmetry breaking in their cubic and isotropic liquid phases. The molecules have a taper&#8208;shaped 3,4,5&#8208;trialkoxybenzoate segment connected to rod&#8208;like building unit terminated with one terminal flexible chain. The two segments were connected using an aliphatic spacer with seven methylene units to induce bending of the whole structure. Investigated by the small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS), a double network achiral cubic phase Cub/Ia3 d, which is a meso&#8208;structure, and a chiral triple network cubic phase Cub/I23[*] are formed. The molecules self&#8208;assemble into molecular helices and progress along the networks. Interestingly, different linking groups such as ester or azo linkages and core fluorination lead to distinct local helicity, resulting in an alkyl chain volume dependent phase transition sequence Ia3d(L)&#8208;I23*&#8208;Ia3d(S). The re&#8208;entry of Iad phase and loss of supramolecular chirality is attributed to the delicate influence of steric effect at the mono&#8208;substitute end and interhelix interaction. Besides, aromatic core fluorination was proved to be a successful tool stabilizing the cubic phases in these dimers.</dc:description>

         <title>Ag108(PEt3)24Cl6: A Hexagonal Prismatic Metalloid Cluster</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ligands used for the protection of metalloid clusters heavily influence the resulting structure and shape. For silver, thiolate and alkynyl ligands are commonly used, while phosphines usually play a minor role as co&#8208;ligands. Herein, we report the synthesis and structural characterization of Ag108(PEt3)24Cl6 (1), the largest structurally characterized metalloid silver cluster with phosphines and halides as sole ligands. Instead of the frequently observed spherical shape of metalloid clusters, 1&#8217;s structure resembles a hexagonal prism. The highly light and temperature sensitive compound features many similarities to its smaller congener Ag64(PnBu3)16Cl6, though there are distinct structural and electronic differences present. Within 1, a Ag64 subunit can be found, which identifies these clusters as molecular seeds for the formation of faceted nanoparticles.</dc:description>

         <title>Widening the stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of aqueous biphasic systems by changing the ionic liquid cation basicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we demonstrate the formation of new stimuli&#8208;responsive aqueous biphasic systems (ABS), able to respond simultaneously to temperature and pH, or just to one stimulus, therefore allowing the design of more sustainable separation processes. This dual behavior is achieved with ABS formed by mono or dicationic protic ionic liquids as phase&#8208;forming components, being defined by the ionic liquid cation chemical structure or its basicity. While ABS comprising monocationic ionic liquids only respond to the effect of temperature, systems comprising dicationic ionic liquids are simultaneously affected by both temperature and pH variations. Dicationic ionic liquids are here identified as the key to unlock a double response to stimuli, which is due to the presence of two pKa values afforded by the cation. The reported findings contribute to increase the customizability of double stimuli&#8208;responsive ABS based on ionic liquids, whose development was up to date limited to ionic liquids bearing pH&#8208;responsive anions, opening the door towards the development of more sustainable separation processes.</dc:description>

         <title>CoFe2O4 with the In&#8208;Situ Formed Oxygen Vacancies and Co Particles as an Efficient Bifunctional Catalyst for Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries (RZABs) are considered as one of the most promising clean energy device due to their abundant resources, low cost and environmental friendliness. However, their energy efficiency and cycle life are far from satisfactory due to the poor activity and stability of bi&#8208;functional electrocatalyst in air cathode. In this work, an efficient bi&#8208;functional catalyst (rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4/Co) was derived from its precursor (rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4) through a simple annealing process. Electrochemical measurements prove that rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4/Co with the in&#8208;situ formed Co nano particles and rich oxygen vacancies appears excellent oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction catalytic activity compared to its counterpart. Its half&#8208;wave potential is 0.81 V (vs RHE) and the OER overpotential is only 310 mV (vs RHE). In addition, rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries assembled with rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4/Co show the highest peak power density (128.9 mW cm&#8208;2) and cycling stability compared to rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4 and commercial Pt/C&#8208;RuO2 catalysts. This work provides a simple strategy for the design of advanced bifunctional catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Artificial Laccase Catalysts by Introducing Substrate Oxidation Metals into Oxygen&#8208;Reducing Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Cu&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Laccase, a multi&#8208;copper oxidase, is limited by its optimal temperature range and isolation costs. To overcome these challenges, we synthesized copper&#8208;doped zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 (Cu&#8208;ZIF&#8208;67) with 16 mol% Cu as an artificial laccase catalyst. The introduced Cu site acts as the phenol oxidation site, and Co&#8208;based ZIF&#8208;67 is the four&#8208;electron oxygen reduction site. Laccase also employs this division of oxidation and reduction sites. Cu&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67 demonstrated significant catalytic activity, superior to natural laccase, especially at elevated temperatures, and maintained stability across multiple reaction cycles. These findings suggest that Cu&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67 is a robust, reusable alternative for industrial applications requiring high thermal stability and efficient catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeted and Untargeted Amine Metabolite Quantitation in Single Cells with Isobaric Multiplexing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We developed a single cell amine analysis approach utilizing isobarically multiplexed samples of 6 individual cells along with analyte abundant carrier. This methodology was applied for absolute quantitation of amino acids and untargeted relative quantitation of amines in a total of 108 individual cells using nanoflow LC with high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry. Together with individually determined cell sizes, this provides quantification of intracellular&#160;concentrations within individual cells. The targeted method was partially validated for 10 amino acids with limits of detection in low attomoles, linear calibration range covering analyte amounts typically from 30 amol to 120 fmol, and correlation coefficients (R) above 0.99. This was applied with cell sizes recorded during dispensing to determine millimolar intracellular amino acid concentrations. The untargeted approach yielded 249 features that were detected in at least 25% of the single cells, providing modest cell type separation on principal component analysis. Using Greedy forward selection with regularized least squares, a sub&#8208;selection of 100 features explaining most of the difference was determined. These features were annotated using MS2 from analyte standards and accurate mass with library search. The approach provides accessible, sensitive, and high&#8208;throughput method with the potential to be expanded also to other forms of ultrasensitive analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Zn Deposition Manner by Confining the Reactivity of Free Water in the Electric Double Layer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising candidates of next&#8208;generation energy storage devices with high safety and theoretical capacity. However, the irreversibility of metallic Zn anode, attributed to dendrite growth and water decomposition, severely limits the cycling durability of AZIBs and restricts their further development. Herein, a facile surface engineering strategy is put forward to tackle the issue of poor reversibility of the Zn anode. Benzotriazole (BTA) is employed as a functional additive of ZnSO4 electrolyte to confine the reactivity of free water situated in the electric double layer (EDL). Experimental results and theoretical simulation reveal that BTA can preferiencially adsorb onto the Zn surface to uniform Zn2+ ion distribution and alleviate H2O&#8208;involved side reactions like hydrogen evolution, and surface passivation. Consequently, in BTA&#8208;modulated aqueous electrolyte, the lifespan of the Zn anode is extended from 170 h to 1092 h at 1 mA cm&#8208;2/1 mAh cm&#8208;2. The reversibility improvement of Zn anode also benefits the cycling durability of full devices including supercapacitors and batteries. Zn||I&#8322; batteries assembled in as&#8208;designed electrolyte witness only 11.3% capacity decay over 17000 cycles at 1 A g&#8208;1, far outstripping that observed in ZnSO4 counterpart (~ 4675 cycles).</dc:description>

         <title>ACuGa6S10 (A = Rb, Cs): Design and Synthesis of Two New Cavity&#8208;Chalcopyrite Chalcogenides Based on "Iterative Substitution" Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two new non&#8208;centrosymmetric chalcogenides, ACuGa6S10 (A = Rb, Cs) have been successfully synthesized by an "iterative substitution" strategy based on chalcopyrite CuFeS2 structural template. Benefiting from the substitution of Fe3+ cations by Ga3+ cations, ACuGa6S10 (A = Rb, Cs) exhibit wide suitable band gap of 2.48 and 2.40 eV, respectively, which is about five times higher than their structure template CuFeS2, and the large second harmonic generation response (1.5 and 1.8 &#215; AgGaS2). Combining theoretical calculation and structural analysis confirm that the [GaS4] tetrahedra make the main contribution on their good liner and nonlinear optical (NLO) performances. The "iterative substitution" strategy expands the design idea of materials and can lead to the discovery of a large number of IR NLO compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic seawater splitting by Earth&#8208;abundant catalysts: metal&#8208;semiconductor metamaterials made of plasmonic magnesium diboride and transitional metal dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;semiconductor metamaterials hold great promise for photocatalytic water splitting due to their excellent light harvesting in a broad spectral range as well as efficient charge carrier generation and transfer. In majority of such metamaterials, semiconductors are used to initiate the water splitting reaction, while their metal counterparts are employed to improve light harvesting through plasmonic effects. Here, we describe for the first time an exceptional reversed case of metal&#8208;semiconductor photocatalysts in which metals are used to initiate the water splitting reaction and semiconductors are employed to improve light harvesting through blackbody effect and serve as co&#8208;catalysts. The studied photoanodes are made of non&#8208;noble plasmonic MgB2 combined with transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). The plasmonic resonances of the MgB2 component contribute to field confinement, plasmon&#8211;exciton coupling, and hot&#8208;electron transfer providing an enhancement of photoactivity in the entire solar spectrum capable of water splitting. The TMDC component provides impedance matching and enhances light absorption by the metal catalyst. We demonstrate seawater splitting with MgB2&#8208;TMDCs photoanodes attaining current densities of ~ 3 mA&#8901;cm&#8208;2 at solar radiation. The overall efficiency of hydrogen production in seawater splitting by sunlight with the help of the studied photoanodes is 3% at bias voltage of Vbias = 0.3 V.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Cu (I) Complexes for Intracellular Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Azide Alkyne Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) has heralded a new era of chemical biology and biomedicine. However, caveats of CuAAC include formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other copper&#8208;related toxicity. This limits utility in sensitive biological samples and matrices. Towards addressing these caveats, we synthesized and fully characterized two air and water stable trinuclear Cu (I) dimer complexes. The complexes were stable to oxidation in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, acid, base, and other chelators, which was reasoned to be due to the linear benzimidazole&#8208;Cu&#8208;benzimidazole geometry. Computational investigations of the catalytic cycle implicated two of the three coppers in the trimer complex as the active metal centers. The complexes were shown to catalyze the reaction at far below sub&#8208;toxic concentrations for intracellular click reactions to label triple negative breast cancer cells and compared to the current CuSO&#173;4&#8208;THPTA standard.</dc:description>

         <title>Networked Multicomponent Ensemble as AND Gate with FRET Output</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A networked supramolecular logic AND gate system is accomplished using precise chemical communication within a multicomponent ensemble via metal ion&#8208;driven self&#8208;sorting processes. The cybernetic AND gate is composed of a copper(I)&#8208;loaded nanoswitch, an aza&#8208;crown ether and a rhodamine receptor. The modus operandi of the AND gate, from state (0,0), was induced with stoichiometric amounts of two inputs (IN&#8208;1&#160;= Hg2+,&#160;IN&#8208;2&#160;= Li+) generating copper(I) ions as output only in state (1,1). Generation of state (1,1) from state (0,0) involves selective Cu+&#160;ion translocation from the nanoswitch to the aza&#8208;crown ether in the first step (IN&#8208;1) and then from the aza&#8208;crown ether to the rhodamine receptor in the second step (IN&#8208;2). The released copper(I) output acts as a messenger that binds to the rhodamine receptor, triggering it's spiro&#8208;lactam ring opening, which leads to a diagnostic FRET emission from the copper(I)&#8208;loaded Rhodamine scaffold accompanied by a remarkable fluorescence and colour change from pale yellow to pink.</dc:description>

         <title>Cleavage of a Peroxide Bond via a Dual Attack by Functional&#160;Mimics of Glutathione Peroxidase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonmetal&#8208;containing peroxidase enzymes, including glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and peroxiredoxins, control cellular redox levels by catalyzing the reduction of H2O2. The remarkably higher reactivity of GPx enzyme as compared to the fully dissociated synthetic selenolate/thiolate molecule is probably due to the dual&#8208;attack on the peroxide bond (HO1&#8208;O2H) by the enzyme; The first one is a nucleophilic attack of the selenolate/thiolate moiety to O1 atom and the second attack at the O2 atom of the peroxide bond by the acidic &#8220;parked proton&#8221; from Trp or His residue present at the enzyme&#8217;s active site, leading to the facile cleavage of O&#8208;O bond. Herein, we report two synthetic compounds (1 and 2), having a selenolate (Se&#8722;) and a proton donor (imidazolium or &#8211;COOH group) moieties, which showed excellent GPx&#8208;like activity via dual&#8208;attack on the peroxide bond. The combined effect of selenolate moiety that donates electrons to the antibonding&#160;orbital of O1&#8208;O2 bond and the imidazolium or carboxylic acid moiety at the side chain that forms a strong H&#8208;bonding with the O2 atom facilitates O&#8208;O bond cleavage of H2O2 more efficiently. 1 and 2 exhibit remarkable ability in protecting Cu(I)&#8208;complex [TpmCu(CH3CN)]+ (9) against H2O2 by acting as a sacrificial antioxidant, thereby preventing metal&#8208;mediated ROS production.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating solvated sheath with anion chelant enables 4.6 V ultra&#8208;stable commercial LiCoO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Increasing cut&#8208;off voltage of lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) (&gt; 4.6 V) is an effective strategy to satisfy the ever&#8208;increasing demand for high energy density. However, the irreversible phase transition significantly destroys the structure of high&#8208;voltage LCO, especially the surface lattice. Considering that the structural stability of LCO is primarily dominated by the intrinsic merits of electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface (EEI), we explored and disclosed the operating mechanism of anion chelating agent tris(pentafluorophenyl) borane (TPFPB) and regulate the CEI layer on LCO electrode. Benefiting from the high HOMO energy level and preferential decomposition of TPFPB&#8208;PF6&#8722;, a robust LiF&#8208;rich CEI layer is constructed and greatly improves the stability of electrode/electrolyte interface. The well&#8208;designed electrolyte composed of 1 mol L&#8208;1 LiPF6 in EC/EMC with TPFPB additives endows Li/LCO half cells and 4 Ah Gr/LCO pouch cell with enhanced cycling stability under a high voltage condition. This work provides pave a new direction for the development of economical high&#8208;voltage LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Diels&#8208;Alder Reactivity of Triisopropylsilyl Ethynyl Substituted Acenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We investigated the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of 6,13&#8208;bis(triisopropylsilyl)pentacene (1) with small dienophiles such as (bridged) dihydronaphthalenes/cyclohexenes that yielded adducts at the central ring, the other dienophiles predominantly or exclusively attacked the unsubstituted off&#8208;center ring. The difference in regioselectivity was investigated by DFT calculations. Apart from dispersion interactions, it is due to the steric demand of the dienophiles, which need to fit in between the silylethynyl substituents to react at the central ring. Epoxynaphthalene adducts of 1 as well as its anthracene and tetracene congeners were deoxygenated, easily furnishing triarenobarrelenes with TIPS&#8208;ethynyl substituents at the bridge heads, attractive building blocks for porous solids and higher acene&#8208;based trimers.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrasonication&#8208;Boosted Resorcinol&#8208;Formaldehyde Resin Nanoparticle Bromine Fixation and Corresponding Upgraded Aquatic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasonication is applied to aqueous Resorcinol&#8208;Formaldehyde Resin Nanoparticle&#8208;based bromine removal and upgraded applications, including silver recovery, MnO2&#8208;involved closed&#8208;loop material cycling, and battery electrode modification. With the benign and scalable acoustic boost, the efficiency of bromine fixation and related post&#8208;applications are significantly improved. The processes motivate the strategic design of water purification with high&#8208;safety and post&#8208;value&#8208;added utilizations.







Abstract
Bromine (Br2) and related species removal from water systems are rather complicated due to the complicated chemistry instability, and materials with high Br2 removal rate and efficiency, along with stimuli/apparatus suitable for highly corrosive environments, are necessary. Ultrasonication as a non&#8208;destructive process is especially suitable in scenarios where conventional stir apparatus is not applicable, such as highly corrosive environments. Considering the validity nature of Br2 and combining the advantages of ultrasonic with a highly stable Br2 fixation method through aromatic polymer nanoparticles, we demonstrate highly efficient acoustic&#8208;aided Br2 removal in aqueous solutions with two times capacity compared to the non&#8208;treated sample. Related aquatic applications are also proposed for the materials to be cost&#8208;effective, including silver (Ag) recovery, recyclable MnO2&#8208;mediated Br2 deep removal, and aqueous zinc anode modification. The coupled novel&#8208;material&#8208;based processes motivate the strategic design of water purification with high&#8208;safety and sustainable industrial procedures and post&#8208;value&#8208;added utilizations.

         <title>Discrete Macrocyclic Polymer Hosts&#8208;Induced Cascade Luminescence Enhancement and Application in Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of polymer, macrocycles and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) molecules brings infinite vitality to the construction of luminescent materials for bioimaging. Herein, we proposed discrete macrocyclic polymers hosts for assembling AIE molecules to induce cascade luminescence enhancement in water and to achieve desirable bioimaging performance via the cooperation of hydra&#8208;headed macrocycles containing two or three pillar[5]arene units, the block polymer F127 and AIE molecules.







Abstract
The integration of polymers, supramolecular macrocycles and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) molecules provides numerous possibilities for constructing various functional supramolecular systems. Herein, we constructed supramolecular assembled systems based on discrete macrocyclic polymer hosts via the cooperation of hydra&#8208;headed macrocycles containing two or three pillar[5]arene units (defined as P2, P3), the block polymer F127 and AIE molecules (alkyl&#8208;cyano modified tetraphenylethene, alkyl&#8208;triazole&#8208;cyano modified 9,10&#8208;distyrylanthracene, defined as TPE&#8208;(CN)4 and DSA&#8208;(TACN)2). Compared with the binary assembly between hydra&#8208;headed hosts or F127 and AIE molecules, cascaded supramolecular assembly&#8208;induced emission enhancement (SAIEE) in aqueous solution was achieved in discrete macrocyclic polymer&#8208;based supramolecular assembled systems. Considering the cascaded SAIEE performance, we have successfully applied discrete macrocyclic polymer&#8208;based supramolecular assembled systems to bioimaging and constructed an artificial light&#8208;harvesting system (LHs) to explore more potential applications. The supramolecular assembly form of discrete macrocyclic polymers hosts and AIE molecules proposed in this work provides new inspiration for the construction and application of high&#8208;performance supramolecular luminescent systems.

         <title>Photo&#8208;/Electrocatalytic Difunctionalization of Alkenes Enabled by C&#8722;H Radical Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in photo&#8208;/electocatalyzed alkene difunctionalization enabled by C&#8722;H radical functionalization are summarized, which are divided to four sections based on the final terminating step, including oxidative radical&#8208;polar crossover coupling, reductive radical&#8208;polar crossover coupling, radical&#8208;radical coupling and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling, along with selected impressive synthetic examples to showcase the importance of the C&#8722;H radical functionalization&#8208;enabled alkene difunctionalization in synthesis.







Abstract
The difunctionalization of alkenes represents a powerful tool to incorporate two functional groups into the alkene bones for increasing molecular complexity and has been widely utilizations in chemical synthesis. Upon the catalysis of the green, sustainable, mild photo&#8208;/electrochemistry technologies, much attentions have been attracted to the development of new tactics for the transformations of the important alkene and alkane feedstocks driven by C&#8722;H radical functionalization. Herein, we summarize recent advances in the photo&#8208;/electrocatalytic difunctionalization of alkenes enabled by C&#8722;H radical functionalization. We detailedly discuss the substrate scope and the mechanisms of the photo&#8208;/electrocatalytic alkene difunctionalization reactions by selecting impressive synthetic examples, which are divided into four sections based on the final terminated step, including oxidative radical&#8208;polar crossover coupling, reductive radical&#8208;polar crossover coupling, radical&#8208;radical coupling, and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling.

         <title>Neutral Adducts of Molybdenum Hexafluoride: Structure and Bonding in MoF6(NC5H5) and MoF6(NC5H5)2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molybdenum hexafluoride was shown to form Lewis acid base adduct with the organic base pyridine, the first neutral transition metal adducts beyond those of WF6. The MoF6(NC5H5) and MoF6(NC5H5)2 adducts adopt capped trigonal prismatic geometries. The trigonal prismatic MoF6 moiety in the adducts can be explained by the high electrostatic potentials of the square faces, where pyridine can coordinate.







Abstract
The first Lewis acid base adducts of MoF6 and an organic base have been synthesized, i.&#8201;e., MoF6(NC5H5) and MoF6(NC5H5)2. These adducts are structurally characterized with X&#8208;ray crystallography, showing that both adducts adopt capped trigonal prismatic structures. The MoF6(NC5H5) and MoF6(NC5H5)2 adducts are fluxional on the NMR time scale at room temperature. Two different fluorine environments could be resolved by 19F NMR spectroscopy at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C for the 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 adduct, MoF6(NC5H5)2, whereas MoF6(NC5H5) remains fluxional at that temperature. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations aide the assignment of the infrared and Raman spectra. Natural Bond Order and Molecular Electrostatic Potential analyses elucidate the structures and properties of the MoF6 pyridine adducts. Regions of significantly higher molecular electrostatic potential, i.&#8201;e., &#963;&#8208;holes, in trigonal prismatic compared to octahedral MoF6 rationalize the capped trigonal prismatic geometry of the adducts. Whereas MoF6(NC5H5) is stable at room temperature under exclusion of moisture, MoF6(NC5H5)2 decomposes at 60&#8201;&#176;C in pyridine solvent, and the solid slowly decomposes at room temperature after 24&#8197;h.

         <title>Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy for Neurodegenerative Diseases: Development of Azobenzene&#8208;Spiropyran@Gold Nanoparticles for Controlled Singlet Oxygen Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A groundbreaking nano&#8208;photosensitizer: a core&#8208;shell merocyanine&#8208;azobenzene on gold nanoparticles. This cutting&#8208;edge technology demonstrates remarkable efficacy in generating singlet oxygen. With its long&#8208;lasting stability and enhanced biocompatibility, it holds immense potential for advancing phototherapy in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.







Abstract
The development of durable photosensitizers is pivotal for advancing phototherapeutic applications in biomedicine. Here, we introduce a core&#8208;shell azobenzene&#8208;spiropyran structure on gold nanoparticles, engineered to enhance singlet oxygen generation. These nano&#8208;photosensitizers exhibit increased structural stability and thermal resistance, as demonstrated by slowed O&#8722;N&#8722;C bond recombination dynamics via in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy. Notably, the in&#8208;situ formation of merocyanine and a light&#8208;induced compact shell arrangement extend its half&#8208;life from 47&#8197;minutes to over 154&#8197;hours, significantly boosting singlet oxygen output. The nano&#8208;photosensitizer also shows high biocompatibility and notably inhibits tau protein aggregation in neural cells, even with phosphatase inhibitors. Further, it promotes dendritic growth in neuro cells, doubling typical lengths. This work not only advances chemical nanotechnology but also sets a foundation for developing long&#8208;lasting phototherapy agents for treating neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Interrogating Explicit Solvent Effects on the Mechanism and Site&#8208;Selectivity of Aryl Halide Oxidative Addition to L2Pd(0)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent identity influences the rate and site&#8208;selectivity of (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halide oxidative addition to Pd(PCy3)2 in several ways. Substrates with H&#8208;bond donating groups are deactivated in polar solvents with high solvent hydrogen bonding basicity, whereas electron deficient substrates and aryl triflates undergo faster oxidative addition in more polar solvents.







Abstract
We report a study of solvent effects on the rate, selectivity, and mechanism of (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halide oxidative addition to Pd(PCy3)2 as an exemplar of L2Pd(0) species. First, 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;aminopyridine is observed to undergo faster oxidative addition in toluene compared to more polar solvents, which is not consistent with the trend we observe with many other 2&#8208;halopyridines. We attribute this to solvent basicity hydrogen bonding between solvent and substrate. Greater hydrogen bond donation from the substrate leads to a more electron&#8208;rich aromatic system, and therefore slower oxidative addition. We demonstrate how this affects rate and site&#8208;selectivity for hydrogen bond donating substrates. Second, electron&#8208;deficient multihalogenated pyridines exhibit improved site&#8208;selectivity in polar solvents, which we attribute to different C&#8722;X sites undergoing oxidative addition by two different mechanisms. The C&#8722;X site that favours the more polar nucleophilic displacement transition state is preferred over the site that favours a less&#8208;polar 3&#8208;centered transition state. Finally, (hetero)aryl triflates consistently undergo faster oxidative addition in more polar solvents, which we attribute to highly polar nucleophilic displacement transition states. This leads to improved site&#8208;selectivity for C&#8722;OTf oxidative addition, even in the presence of highly reactive 2&#8208;pyridyl halides.

Indolizines are important N&#8208;fused heterocycles which exist widely in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and organic optoelectronic materials. In this communication, A base promoted oxidative [4+2] annulation of pyrrole&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehyde derivatives with o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl propargylamines for the synthesis of highly substituted indolizines has been developed. Using DBN as base, a broad range of 5,6,7&#8208;trisubstituted indolizines have been prepared in good to excellent yields under mild conditions, and many useful functional groups can be tolerated.

         <title>Ferrocenyl Dithiophosphonate Ag(I) Complexes: Synthesis, Structures, Luminescence, and Electrocatalytic Water Splitting Tuned by Nuclearity and Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heterometallic mono&#8208; and di&#8208;nuclear Ag(I) ferrocenyl dithiophosphonates with various alkyl chains were characterized, and fluorescence emission at RT was detected for the first time with effective quantum yields. The HER activity reveals the impact of metallic nuclearity and peripheral ligand engineering. The electrolytic results with the proposed mechanism were supported by the DFT study and established a link between molecular structures and their physical and HER catalytic properties, advancing the field of renewable energy resources.







Abstract
The heterometallic [Ag(I)/Fe(II)] molecular electrocatalysts for hydrogen production were introduced here to recognize the mutual role of metallic nuclearity and ligand engineering. A series of ferrocenyl dithiophosphonate stabilized mononuclear [Ag(PPh3)2{S2PFc(OR)}] {where R=Me (1), Et (2), nPr (3), iPr (4), iAmyl (5); Fc=Fe (&#627;5&#8208;C5H4) (&#627;5&#8208;C5H5)} and dinuclear [Ag(PPh3){S2PFc(OR}]2 {where R=Et (2&#8201;a), and nPr (3&#8201;a)} complexes were synthesized and characterized by SCXRD, NMR (31P and 1H), ESI&#8208;MS, UV&#8208;Vis, and FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy. The comparative electrocatalytic HER behavior of 1&#8211;5 and 2&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;a showed effective current density of 1&#8197;mA/cm2 with overpotentials ranging from 772 to 991&#8197;mV, demonstrating the influence of extended and branched carbon chains in dithiophosphonates and metallic (mono&#8208;/di&#8722;) nuclearity, which correlates with documented tetra&#8208;nuclear [Ag4(S2PFc(OnPr)4], 6. DFT study suggests the coordinated (&#956;1&#8208;S) site of ligands is the reactivity center and the adsorption energy of intermediate [H*&#8208;SM] varies with the engineering of ligand and nuclearity. A catalytic mechanism using mononuclear (1) and di&#8208;nuclear (2&#8201;a) was proposed with the assistance of DFT. Each complex, being the first example of Ag(I) dithiophosphonates, exhibits intense photoluminescence with high quantum yields ranging from 33&#8201;% to 67&#8201;%. These results link the lower nuclearity structures to their physical and catalytic properties.

         <title>Development of Low&#8208;Toxicity Antimicrobial Polycarbonates Bearing Lysine Residues.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial polycarbonates bearing natural amino acid residues are easy to synthesize and scale up cost&#8208;efficiently. Together with their good biocompatibility, these polymers show great potential as a new class of antibacterial biomaterials to treat bacterial infections and combat emerging antibiotic resistance.







Abstract
Antibiotic resistance has been threatening public health for a long period, while the COVID pandemic aggravated the scenario. To combat antibiotic resistance strains, host defense peptides (HDPs) mimicking molecules have attracted considerable attention. Herein, we reported a series of polycarbonates bearing cationic lysine amino acid residues that could mimic the mechanism of action of HDPs and possess broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activity. Moreover, those polymers had negligible toxicity toward red blood cells and mammalian cells. The membrane&#8208;disruption mechanism endows the lysine&#8208;containing polycarbonates with low possibility of resistance development and the fast killing kinetics, making them promising candidates for antimicrobial development.

         <title>Visible Light Promoted de Mayo Type Reaction of Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first de Mayo&#8208;type reaction of bicyclobutanes has been successfully achieved via triplet energy transfer photocatalysis. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the reaction proceeds through a [2&#960;+2&#963;]&#8208;retro&#8208;aldol cascade, culminating in syn&#8208;specific difunctionalization butanes.







Abstract
We reported herein a visible light mediated de Mayo&#8208;type reaction between 1,3&#8208;diketones and BCB. The reaction proceeds through a [2&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition and retro&#8208;aldol sequence, producing cis&#8208;difunctionalized cyclobutanes in high yields with good regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three heterometallic&#8208;organic cages with customized size and cavity have been precisely constructed using bottom&#8208;up step&#8208;wise coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly strategy. First, three Ru2+&#8208;connected dendritic ligands were synthesized from initial tripodal building blocks. Then, further self&#8208;assembly of metal&#8208;organic ligands with Fe2+ quantitatively generate the desired tetrahedral cages, respectively.







Abstract
Accurately synthesizing coordination&#8208;driven metal&#8208;organic cages with customized shape and cavity remains a great challenge for chemists. In this work, a bottom&#8208;up step&#8208;wise coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly approach was put forward. Employing this strategy, three terpyridyl heterometallic&#8208;organic truncated tetrahedral cages with different sizes and cavity were precisely synthesized. Firstly, the coordination of tripodal organic ligands with Ru2+ afforded dendritic metal&#8208;organic ligands L1&#8208;L3. Then the Ru building blocks complexed with Fe2+ and shrunk to form the desired heterometallic&#8208;organic cages (C1&#8208;C3). These discrete heterometallic&#8208;organic supramolecular cages were fully characterized and displayed the large and open cavities varied from 7205&#8197;&#197;3 to 9384&#8197;&#197;3. Notably, these cages could not be directly constructed by single&#8208;step assembly process using initial organic ligands or dimeric metal&#8208;organic ligands, indicative of the irreplaceability of a bottom&#8208;up step&#8208;wise assembly strategy for size&#8208;customized architectures. This work paves a new way for precisely constructing metal&#8208;organic cages with well&#8208;defined cavities.

This work paves a new way for precisely constructing metal-organic cages with well-defined cavities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fast and Efficient Sensing of Drugs in Water Using Self&#8208;Assembling D&#8208;Glucamine&#8208;Functionalized Naphthalenediimide and 1,8&#8208;Naphthalimide Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employed two self&#8208;assembling fluorophores functionalized with D&#8208;Glucamine, as fluorescent sensors for emerging pollutants in water, such as drugs, belonging to different classes and differing significantly in structure.







Abstract
Fast and sensitive quantification of drugs as emerging pollutants in water bodies is a pressing need in contemporary society, to prevent serious environmental concerns that could negatively impact on human health. This explains the surge of interest in this field, and the need to identify highly selective sensing systems. Addressing this issue, in this work we synthesized two D&#8208;glucamine functionalized fluorophores bearing self&#8208;assembling cores, as 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide and naphthalene diimide. We studied their self&#8208;assembly in water solution, and characterized the aggregated formed by determining their stability constant, their morphology and size by scanning electron microscopy, resonance light scattering and dynamic light scattering, as well their solid&#8208;state emission ability. Then, we studied their sensing ability, in water, towards pharmaceutically active compounds such as ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, carbamazepine and diclofenac sodium salt, by fluorescence investigation. Data collected show that the self&#8208;assembling ability is significantly affected by the fluorophore structure, which in turn also determines sensing ability. In particular, the naphtalene diimide&#8208;based probe was the most sensitive, with LOD as low as 0.01&#8197;&#956;M in the presence of nalidixic acid, which is in line and competitive with more complex sensing systems, recently reported in the literature.

         <title>Access to Diverse Carbonyl Compounds by Catalyst&#8208;Free and Photoinduced Aerobic Cleavage of C=N Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalyst&#8208;free and photoinduced aerobic cleavage of C=N bonds has been developed using oxygen from air as green oxidant. This strategy features broad substrate scope and a series of carbonyl compounds including ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acids and relative drug analogues were obtained. Moreover, the easy&#8208;operation and gram&#8208;scale synthesis indicates the practicality of this method.







Abstract
Functional group interconversion is of great significance in organic synthesis. However, aerobic cleavage of C=N bonds to access carbonyl compounds still suffered from some limitations such as harsh reaction conditions, stoichiometric oxidants, poor substrate scope and use of toxic reagents. Herein, we report a catalyst&#8208;free and photo&#8208;induced aerobic cleavage of C=N bonds to afford diverse carbonyl compounds using oxygen from air as green oxidant. This mild methodology permits N&#8208;tosylhydrazones converted into the corresponding carbonyl compounds including ketones, aldehydes and carboxylic acids, showing broad functional group tolerance and compatibility. Moreover, the gram&#8208;scale reaction and post&#8208;modification of complicated molecules proved the applicability and efficiency of this strategy. Finally, a plausible mechanism was proposed based on spectroscopic investigations and detailed mechanistic studies.

A series of CTFs decorated with different substituents (H, MeO, and F) were synthesized, and they were effective photocatalysts for C&#8722;H activation due to their unique structures and optoelectronic properties. Methoxy&#8208;substituted CTF (MeO&#8208;CTF) exhibited extraordinary catalytic performance and reusability in C&#8722;H functionalization by constructing an electronic donor&#8208;acceptor system, achieving the highest yield in the photocatalytic C3&#8208;H hydroxylation of 2&#8208;phenylimidazole[1,2&#8208;&#945;]pyridine.







Abstract
Covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) are promising heterogeneous photocatalyst candidates owing to their excellent stability, conjugacy, and tunability. In this study, a series of CTFs decorated with different substituents (H, MeO, and F) were synthesised and utilised as photocatalysts for C&#8722;H activation reactions. The corresponding optoelectronic properties could be precisely regulated by the electronic effects of different substituents in the nanopore channels of the CTFs; these CTFs were effective photocatalysts for C&#8722;H activation in organic synthesis due to their unique structures and optoelectronic properties. Methoxy&#8208;substituted CTF (MeO&#8208;CTF) exhibited extraordinary catalytic performance and reusability in C&#8722;H functionalization by constructing an electronic donor&#8208;acceptor system, achieving the highest yield in the photocatalytic C3&#8211;H hydroxylation of 2&#8208;phenylimidazole[1,2&#8208;&#945;]pyridine. This strategy provides a new scaffold for the rational design of CTFs as efficient photocatalysts for organic synthesis.

Using the predictable packing arrangement of guanidinium organosulfonate with a pyrene core a host of different small molecules can be encapsulated and their structures elucidated.







Abstract
Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) is the preferred and most accurate technique for determining molecular structures. However, it can present challenges when dealing with specific small molecules and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), as many do not form quality crystals without coformers or can be unstable. In this study, we introduce tetrakis(guanidinium) pyrenetetrasulfonate (G4PYR), a robust guanidinium&#8208;organosulfonate (GS) framework that efficiently encapsulates small molecules and APIs rich in functional groups. The hydrogen bonding frameworks formed by G4PYR display well&#8208;ordered structures with predictable pyrene&#8208;pyrene distances, making them ideally suited for targeting arene&#8208;based APIs with pendant groups. Successful encapsulation of various guests, including benzaldehyde, benzamide, and arenes containing multiple hydrogen bond donors and acceptors like uracil and thymine, was achieved. Furthermore, we successfully encapsulated important pharmaceutical and biologically relevant compounds, such as lidocaine, ropinirole, adenosine, thymidine, and others. Notably, we present a workflow for investigating host&#8208;guest complex formation using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and high throughput experimentation.

         <title>Recent Advances in DNA&#8208;Based Nanoprobes for In vivo MiRNA Imaging</title>

         <dc:description>
This concept review summarizes signal amplification strategies including DNAzyme catalytic reaction, hybrid chain reaction (HCR), catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) to enhance detection signal of lowly expressed miRNAs; external stimuli and internal stimuli to prevent nonspecific activation; and the development of NIR&#8208;II fluorescent probes for in&#8197;vivo miRNA imaging and indicated current challenges for in&#8197;vivo miRNA imaging.







Abstract
As a post transcriptional regulator of gene expression, microRNAs (miRNA) is closely related to many major human diseases, especially cancer. Therefore, its precise detection is very important for disease diagnosis and treatment. With the advancement of fluorescent dye and imaging technology, the focus has shifted from in&#8197;vitro miRNA detection to in&#8197;vivo miRNA imaging. This concept review summarizes signal amplification strategies including DNAzyme catalytic reaction, hybrid chain reaction (HCR), catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) to enhance detection signal of lowly expressed miRNAs; external stimuli of ultraviolet (UV) light or near&#8208;infrared region (NIR) light, and internal stimuli such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), glutathione (GSH), protease and cell membrane protein to prevent nonspecific activation for the avoidance of false positive signal; and the development of fluorescent probes with emission in NIR for in&#8197;vivo miRNA imaging; as well as rare earth nanoparticle based the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) nanoprobes with excellent tissue penetration and depth for in&#8197;vivo miRNA imaging. The concept review also indicated current challenges for in&#8197;vivo miRNA imaging including the dynamic monitoring of miRNA expression change and simultaneous in&#8197;vivo imaging of multiple miRNAs.

This concept review summarizes signal amplification strategies including DNAzyme catalytic reaction, hybrid chain reaction (HCR), catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) to enhance detection signal of lowly expressed miRNAs; external stimuli of ultraviolet (UV) light or near-infrared region (NIR) light, and internal stimuli such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), glutathione (GSH), protease and cell membrane protein to prevent nonspecific activation for the avoidance of false positive signal; and the development of fluorescent probes with emission in NIR for &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vivo&lt;/i&gt; miRNA imaging; as well as rare earth nanoparticle based the second near-infrared window (NIR-II) nanoprobes with excellent tissue penetration and depth for &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vivo&lt;/i&gt; miRNA imaging. The concept review also indicated current challenges for &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vivo&lt;/i&gt; miRNA imaging including the dynamic monitoring of miRNA expression change and simultaneous in&#8197;vivo imaging of multiple miRNAs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

We report on the development of novel dual light&#8208;responsive and redox&#8208;active foldamers that demonstrate multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviour of the supramolecular scaffold and display low levels of operational fatigue upon cyclic treatments with light and oxidative/reductive conditions.







Abstract
We report on dual, light&#8208;responsive and redox&#8208;active foldamers that demonstrate reversible and robust stimuli&#8208;induced behaviour. Herein, UV/Vis, 1H NMR and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry have been used to establish the reversibility and highly robust nature of the light&#8208; and redox&#8208;driven behaviour of these new foldamers with minimal levels of fatigue observed even upon multiple cyclic treatments with irradiative/non&#8208;irradiative and oxidative/reductive conditions. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept work paves the way towards the creation of novel stimuli&#8208;responsive foldamers of increasing sophistication capable of demonstrating reversible and robust responses to multiple distinct stimuli.

         <title>Orthogonal Geometry Enhancing the Intersystem Crossing and Photosensitive Efficiency of Spiro Organoboron Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations are conducted to investigate the potential photosensitivity of spiro organoboron compounds. Geometric analysis reveals that the configuration of S1 determines the molecular ISC rate constants, and PSs with a (N, N) acceptor exhibit higher theoretical sensitization efficiency than those with a (N, O) acceptor, which is contributed by the donor&#8208;acceptor orthogonal feature.







Abstract
Based on the reported spiro organoboron compounds (PS1 and PS2 as potent 1O2 sensitizers), several new organoboron molecules (PS4&#8211;PS9) were constructed through structural modification, and their low&#8208;lying excited states and photophysical properties have been explored by density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations. The predicted effective intersystem crossing (ISC) processes arise from the S1&#8594;T2 transition for PS4&#8211;PS6 and the S1&#8594;T4 transition for PS1, and corresponding KISC rate constants reach the order of magnitude of 109 (s&#8722;1). The organoboron compounds with a (N, N) chelate acceptor are predicted to exhibit relatively higher ISC efficiency than those bearing a (N, O) acceptor, and the planar C3NBN ring and the orthogonal configuration between the donor and acceptor moieties are responsible for the ISC rate enhancement. Importantly, the geometric features of the lowest singlet excited state (S1) for these compounds play a decisive role in their photosensitive efficiency. The present results provide a basis for better understanding of the photosensitivity of these spiro organoboron compounds and the structural modification effect.

         <title>Constructing Cyclic Hydrogen Bonding to Suppress Side Reactions and Dendrite Formation on Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;hydroxymethylacetamide additives in 2&#8197;M ZnSO4 electrolytes disrupt water molecule networks, inhibiting dendrite growth and improving zinc anode stability, while guiding uniform zinc deposition, significantly enhancing battery cycle life and Coulombic efficiency. This work underscores the potential of electrolyte additives to address critical limitations in zinc metal batteries.







Abstract
The high electrochemical reactivity of H2O molecules and zinc metal results in severe side reactions and dendrite formation on zinc anodes. Here we demonstrate that these issues can be addressed by using N&#8208;hydroxymethylacetamide (NHA) as additives in 2&#8197;M ZnSO4 electrolytes. The addition of NHA molecules, acting as both a hydrogen bond donor and acceptor, enables the formation of cyclic hydrogen bonding with H2O molecules. This interaction disrupts the existing hydrogen bonding networks between H2O molecules, hindering proton transport, and containing H2O molecules within the cyclic hydrogen bonding structure to prevent deprotonation. Additionally, NHA molecules show a preference for adsorption on the (101) crystal surface of zinc metal. This preferential adsorption reduces the surface energy of the (101) plane, facilitating the homogeneous Zn deposition along the (101) direction. Thus, the NHA enables Zn||Zn symmetric cell with a cycle lifespan of 1100&#8197;hours at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and Zn||Cu asymmetric cell with a high Coulombic efficiency over 99.5&#8201;%. Moreover, the NHA&#8208;modified Zn||AC zinc ion hybrid capacitor is capable of sustaining 15000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This electrolyte additive engineering presents a promising strategy to enhance the performance and broaden the application potential of zinc metal&#8208;based energy storage devices.

         <title>Columnar Organization of Nonalternant Fluorinated Dehydrobenzannulenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
I'm still stacking! Partially fluorinated dehydrobenzannulene macrocycles have been synthesized using a combination of Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira couplings and oxidative alkyne dimerizations. They stack into extended slipped columns despite their low symmetry which prevents full electronic self&#8208;complementarity. These stacking arrangements are mediated by slipped [&#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;] interactions between fluorinated arene rings and fluoroarene&#8208;arene short contacts. Computations suggest that this assembly is dispersion&#8208;driven.







Abstract
Two new partially fluorinated dehydrobenzannulenes have been prepared by inter&#8208; and intramolecular oxidative homocoupling of diyne precursors. These systems contain fluorinated and nonfluorinated arene rings in a desymmetrized non&#8208;alternant arrangement. Both macrocycles are roughly planar and organize into extended columns in the solid state. The assembly of these columns is mediated by the combination of dispersion interactions, slipped [&#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;] stacking interactions of the perfluorinated rings with each other, and their association with the nonfluorinated rings in the molecules of the neighboring macrocycles. These results suggest that partial fluorination of dehydrobenzannulenes can serve as a versatile motif for their assembly into columnar superstructures.

         <title>Twist along Central C&#8722;C Bonds in a Series of Fully &#960;&#8208;Fused Propellanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twist in a series of &#960;&#8208;fused propellanes is investigated by both theoretical and experimental methods. A biphenyl&#8208;fused [4.4.4]propellane gives D3&#8208;symmetric enantiomers stable at 146&#8201;&#176;C, whereas naphthalene&#8208;fused [3.3.3]propellane and [4.3.3]hybrid show non&#8208;twisted form and fast twist inversion at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C between (P/M)&#8208;conformations, respectively. The twist is correlated with large changes of NMR chemical shifts and other physical properties.







Abstract
Without stereogenic carbon centers, organic molecules can be chiral when they have large energy barriers for conformational inversion. In this work, conformational behaviors are investigated for a series of tricyclic propellane skeletons with increasing 6&#8208;membered&#8208;ring peripheral moieties fused with aromatic rings. According to theoretical calculations, trinaphtho[3.3.3]propellane has three vertical naphthalene rings like triptycene shape without torsion along the central C&#8722;C single bond. On the other hand, hexabenzo[4.4.4]propellane shows hexaphenylethane&#8208;like ca. 60&#176; twist along the bond with large activation energy of 64&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for twist inversion because of the high congestion caused by three 6&#8208;membered&#8208;ring loops. Indeed, the [4.4.4]propellane gives a stable pair of chiroptical enantiomers toward heating at 146&#8201;&#176;C.

&lt;p&gt;Twist in a series of &#960;-fused propellanes is investigated by both theoretical and experimental methods. A biphenyl-fused [4.4.4]propellane gives &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric enantiomers stable at 146&#8201;&#176;C, whereas naphthalene-fused [3.3.3]propellane and [4.3.3]hybrid show non-twisted form and fast twist inversion at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C between (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;)-conformations, respectively. The twist is correlated with large changes of NMR chemical shifts and other physical properties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without stereogenic carbon centers, organic molecules can be chiral when they have large energy barriers for conformational inversion. In this work, conformational behaviors are investigated for a series of tricyclic propellane skeletons with increasing 6-membered-ring peripheral moieties fused with aromatic rings. According to theoretical calculations, trinaphtho[3.3.3]propellane has three vertical naphthalene rings like triptycene shape without torsion along the central C&#8722;C single bond. On the other hand, hexabenzo[4.4.4]propellane shows hexaphenylethane-like ca. 60&#176; twist along the bond with large activation energy of 64&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for twist inversion because of the high congestion caused by three 6-membered-ring loops. Indeed, the [4.4.4]propellane gives a stable pair of chiroptical enantiomers toward heating at 146&#8201;&#176;C. By contrast, a hybrid [4.3.3]propellane exhibits fast interconversion between two twisted conformations even at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Design of Mesoporous ZnFe2O4@g&#8208;C3N4 Heterojunctions for Environmental Remediation and Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporous magnetic nanocomposites (MNCs) comprising g&#8208;C3N4@ZnFe2O4, featuring tiny mesopores and effective heterojunctions, demonstrate superior catalytic performance for hydrogen evolution and dye degradation under solar illumination, with recyclability and easy separation using magnets.







Abstract
Mesoporous catalysts with a high specific surface area, accessible pore structures, and appropriate band edges are desirable for optimal charge transfer across the interfaces, suppress electron&#8208;hole recombination, and promote redox reactions at the active sites. The present study demonstrates the rational design of mesoporous ZnFe2O4@g&#8208;C3N4 magnetic nanocomposites (MNCs) with different pore sizes and pore volumes following a combination of facile thermal itching and thermal impregnation methods. The MNCs preserve the structural, morphological, and physical attributes of their counterparts while ensuring their effectiveness and superior catalytic capabilities. The morphological analysis confirms the successful grafting and confinement of ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles with the polymeric g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets to form heterojunctions with numerous interfaces. The MNCs possess uniformly distributed small mesopores (pore size &lt;4&#8197;nm), ample active sites, and a high specific surface area of 62.50&#8197;m2/g. The mesoporous ZnFe2O4@g&#8208;C3N4 notably improve hydrogen evolution rate and methylene blue dye degradation. The optimal loading weight of ZnFe2O4 is 20&#8201;%, in which the MNCs display the highest hydrogen evolution rate of 1752&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and photo&#8208;Fenton dye degradation rate constants of 0.147&#8197;min&#8722;1, upon solar&#8208;light illumination. Furthermore, the photocatalysts demonstrate recyclability over five consecutive cycles, confirming their stability, while easy separation using a simple magnet underscores practical utility.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Method for the Selective Synthesis of Amides and N&#8208;Acylureas from Carboxylic Acids and Thioureas</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the presence of a base and photocatalyst, thiourea undergoes deprotonation and a single&#8208;electron transfer process, subsequently leading to desulfurization and the formation of carbodiimide. Ultimately, the carboxylic acid reacts with carbodiimide, and can selectively produce amides and N&#8208;acylureas.







Abstract
In this work, we developed a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven method for the selective synthesis of amides and N&#8208;acylureas from carboxylic acids and thioureas. This protocol was featured as avoidance of additional oxidants and transition metal catalysts, simple manipulations, low cost, broad substrate scope, and good functional group tolerance. As only oxygen serves as the oxidation reagent, this method provides a promising synthesis candidate for the formation of N&#8208;aryl amides and N&#8208;acylureas, including late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex pharmaceutical molecules and biologically active molecules.

         <title>Lewis Acid Regulation Strategy for Constructing D&#8208;A&#8208;A Covalent Organic Frameworks with Enhanced Photocatalytic Organic Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of D&#8722;A&#8208;A COFs are constructed by a novel Lewis acid regulatory strategy. In here, Lewis acid sites can be used as electron acceptors to facilitate the separation and transfer of h+&#8722;e&#8722; pairs and further increase optoelectronic properties. Among them, PYBP&#8208;MgCl2&#8208;COF exhibited the best activity for the visible light&#8208;induced aerobic hydroxylation conversion of arylboronic acids with excellent yield and substrates compatibility.







Abstract
Owing to their excellent photoelectric properties, donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) type photocatalytic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted significant research interest in recent years. However, the limited D&#8722;A structural units of existing COFs restrict the development of novel and efficient photocatalytic COF materials. To solve this problem, we developed a series of D&#8722;A&#8208;A&#8208;type COFs utilizing a Lewis acid regulation strategy, in which Lewis acids act as the coordination centers, and pyridine and cyano groups act as ligands. Lewis acid sites in COFs serve as electron acceptors, facilitating the separation and transfer of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs. This process is crucial for photocatalysis because it significantly increases the efficiency of the catalytic reaction by reducing the recombination rate of charge carriers. The developed Lewis acid&#8208;activated D&#8722;A&#8208;A COFs efficiently catalyzed the hydroxylation of various phenylboronic acid compounds under visible light. The developed catalysts are expected to contribute to increasing the fabrication efficiency of industrially important organic materials.

         <title>Direct Synthesis for Benzofuro[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidin&#8208;2&#8208;Amines via One&#8208;Pot Cascade [4+2] Annulation/Aromatization between Benzofuran&#8208;Derived Azadienes and Carbodiimide Anions</title>

A novel protocol for the efficient synthesis of benzofuro[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidin&#8208;2&#8208;amines through a chemselective one&#8208;pot cascade [4+2] annulation/aromatization between benzofuran&#8208;derived azadienes and cyanamides has been described. The calculated studies well explained the chemoselectivity between carbodiimide anions and the isomerized cyanamide anions.







Abstract
The chemoselective [4+2] annulation/aromatization reactions between benzofuran&#8208;derived azadienes and N&#8722;Ts cyanamides are developed, affording a convenient method for synthesizing benzofuro[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidin&#8208;2&#8208;amines under mild conditions. Herein, N&#8722;Ts cyanamides participated in reactions selectively via carbodiimide anion intermediates and the corresponding cyanamide anion intermediates derived products were not observed. The proposed chemoselective stepwise reaction mechanism was well supported by DFT calculations.

         <title>Harnessing Gene Editing Technology for Tumor Microenvironment Modulation: An Emerging Anticancer Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of gene editing technologies, particularly the CRISPR&#8208;Cas system, offers promising new strategies for the cancer treatment. Benefiting from nanomaterial strategies, the limitations of CRISPR&#8208;Cas system for in&#8197;vivo application are dramatically improved and can effectively regulate the tumor microenvironment, which provides a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art avenue for tumor therapy.







Abstract
Cancer is a multifaceted disease influenced by both intrinsic cellular traits and extrinsic factors, with the tumor microenvironment (TME) being crucial for cancer progression. To satisfy their high proliferation and aggressiveness, cancer cells always plunder large amounts of nutrients and release various signals to their surroundings, forming a dynamic TME with special metabolic, immune, microbial and physical characteristics. Due to the neglect of interactions between tumor cells and the TME, traditional cancer therapies often struggle with challenges such as drug resistance, low efficacy, and recurrence. Importantly, the development of gene editing technologies, particularly the CRISPR&#8208;Cas system, offers promising new strategies for cancer treatment. Combined with nanomaterial strategies, CRISPR&#8208;Cas technology exhibits precision, affordability, and user&#8208;friendliness with reduced side effects, which holds great promise for profoundly altering the TME at the genetic level, potentially leading to lasting anticancer outcomes. This review will delve into how CRISPR&#8208;Cas can be leveraged to manipulate the TME, examining its potential as a transformative anticancer therapy.
