      <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Thiophene&#8208;based Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8211;Donor Heptameric Ligands for Spectral Assignment of Polymorphic Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Deposits</title>
      <dc:description>
Head or tail: Distinct periodicity of anionic charges along the conjugated backbone is an important chemical determinant for achieving thiophene&#8208;based donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor heptameric ligands for spectral assignment of different amyloid&#8208;&#946; deposits. Having the acetate side chains of the central trimeric thiophene&#8208;BTD&#8208;thiophene unit tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail instead of head&#8208;to&#8208;head greatly reduced the ability of the ligand to distinguish A&#946; morphotypes.







Abstract
Protein deposits are associated with many devastating diseases and fluorescent ligands able to visualize these pathological entities are essential. Here, we report the synthesis of thiophene&#8208;based donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor heptameric ligands that can be utilized for spectral assignment of distinct amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) aggregates, one of the pathological hallmarks in Alzheimer's disease. The ability of the ligands to selectively distinguish A&#946; deposits was abolished when the chemical composition of the ligands was altered. Our findings provide the structural and functional basis for the development of new fluorescent ligands that can distinguish between aggregated proteinaceous species consisting of the same peptide or protein. In addition, such ligands might aid in interpreting the potential role of polymorphic A&#946; deposits in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

      <title>Surface&#8208;Deactivated Core&#8211;Shell Metal&#8211;Organic Framework by Simple Ligand Exchange for Enhanced Size Discrimination in Aerobic Oxidation of Alcohols</title>
      <dc:description>
Site control: Removing catalytic sites near the surface of the MOF crystal allowed for enhanced size discrimination of the reactants thus improving selectivity.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are an attractive catalyst support for stable immobilization of the active sites in their scaffold due to the high tunability of organic ligands. The active site&#8208;functionalized ligands can be easily employed to construct MOFs as porous heterogeneous catalysts. However, the existence of active sites on the external surfaces as well as internal pores of MOFs seriously impedes the selective reaction in the pore. Herein, through a simple post&#8208;synthetic ligand exchange (PSE) method we synthesized surface&#8208;deactivated (only core&#8208;active) core&#8211;shell&#8208;type MOF catalysts, which contain 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxyl (TEMPO) groups on the ligand as active sites for aerobic oxidation of alcohols. The porous but catalytically inactive shell ensured the size&#8208;selective permeability by sieving effects and induced all reactions to take place in the pores of the catalytically active core. Because PSE is a facile and universal approach, this can be rapidly applied to a variety of MOF&#8208;based catalysts for enhancing reaction selectivity.

      <dc:description>
The photoinitiated, radical&#8208;mediated thiol&#8208;ene coupling reaction of unsaturated sugars is shown as a fast, simple and powerful new method for the stereoselective synthesis of a broad variety of thio&#8208;linked glycomimetics. Addition of thiols to 2&#8208;substituted hexoglycals under UV&#8208;irradiation leads to exclusive formation of 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;S&#8208;glycosides independently of the sugar identity and the protecting groups applied. Application of exoglycals or 1&#8208;substituted endoglycals as the alkene partners enables stereoselective formation of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glycosidic and &#946;&#8208;mannosidic structures. Hence, this method can be utilized for the efficient synthesis of stable carbohydrate mimetics, which would be very difficult by the classical ionic methods.

      <dc:description>
Ruthenium catalysts for the synthesis of heterocycles: Metal&#8208;induced cyclization of functionalized alkynes represents one of the most general approaches to prepare organic heterocycles. Although RuII centers are well&#8208;established to promote alkyne to vinylidene rearrangements and many RuII&#8208;mediated alkyne cyclizations have been rationalized to be the results of post&#8208;vinylidene transformations, recent discoveries indicate that RuII centers can serve as electrophiles and induce alkyne cyclizations without vinylidene intermediacy. In their Minireview on page&#8197;6102&#8197;ff., C.&#8208;Y.&#8197;Wong et&#8197;al. give an overview of the RuII&#8208;induced cyclization of heteroatom&#8208;functionalized alkynes in the last decade, with an emphasis on the discoveries and validations of the unconventional &#8220;non&#8208;vinylidene&#8208;involving&#8221; pathways.

      <title>Fabrication of Carbon Nanotube Thin Films for Flexible Transistors by Using a Cross&#8208;Linked Amine Polymer</title>
      <dc:description>
An efficient method for the fabrication of the single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) thin film using cross&#8208;linking methoxycarbonyl polyallylamine (Moc&#8208;PAA) was developed. The amine&#8208;terminated surface of cross&#8208;linked Moc&#8208;PAA enables the formation of the highly dense and uniform thin film of SWCNT networks. The thin film transistor using the fabricated SWCNT film exhibited an excellent performance with a small variability.







Abstract
Owing to their remarkable properties, single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube thin&#8208;film transistors (SWCNT&#8208;TFTs) are expected to be used in various flexible electronics applications. To fabricate SWCNT channel layers for TFTs, solution&#8208;based film formation on a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) covered with amino groups is commonly used. However, this method uses highly oxidized surfaces, which is not suitable for flexible polymeric substrates. In this work, a solution&#8208;based SWCNT film fabrication using methoxycarbonyl polyallylamine (Moc&#8208;PAA) is reported. The NH2&#8208;terminated surface of the cross&#8208;linked Moc&#8208;PAA layer enables the formation of highly dense and uniform SWCNT networks on both rigid and flexible substrates. TFTs that use the fabricated SWCNT thin film exhibited excellent performance with small variations. The presented simple method to access SWCNT thin film accelerates the realization of flexible nanoelectronics.

The amine&#8208;terminated surface of cross&#8208;linked Moc&#8208;PAA enables the formation of the highly dense and uniform thin film of SWCNT networks. The thin film transistor using the fabricated SWCNT film exhibited an excellent performance with a small variability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owing to their remarkable properties, single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube thin&#8208;film transistors (SWCNT&#8208;TFTs) are expected to be used in various flexible electronics applications. To fabricate SWCNT channel layers for TFTs, solution&#8208;based film formation on a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) covered with amino groups is commonly used. However, this method uses highly oxidized surfaces, which is not suitable for flexible polymeric substrates. In this work, a solution&#8208;based SWCNT film fabrication using methoxycarbonyl polyallylamine (Moc&#8208;PAA) is reported. The NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;terminated surface of the cross&#8208;linked Moc&#8208;PAA layer enables the formation of highly dense and uniform SWCNT networks on both rigid and flexible substrates. TFTs that use the fabricated SWCNT thin film exhibited excellent performance with small variations. The presented simple method to access SWCNT thin film accelerates the realization of flexible nanoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Overview of Synthetic Methods to Prepare Plasmonic Transition&#8208;Metal Nitride Nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>
Standout stability: The search for plasmonic materials that are low&#8208;cost, chemically and thermally stable, and exhibit low optical losses has attracted significant attention. Among new materials, plasmonic transition&#8208;metal nitride nanostructures are promising non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal alternatives. Herein, new synthetic techniques for the preparation of these materials are summarized.







Abstract
The search for new plasmonic materials that are low&#8208;cost, chemically and thermally stable, and exhibit low optical losses has garnered significant attention among researchers. Recently, metal nitrides have emerged as promising alternatives to conventional, noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based plasmonic materials, such as silver and gold. Many of the initial studies on metal nitrides have focused on computational prediction of the plasmonic properties of these materials. In recent years, several synthetic methods have been developed to enable empirical analysis. This review highlights synthetic techniques for the preparation of plasmonic metal nitride nanoparticles, which are predominantly free&#8208;standing, by using solid&#8208;state and solid&#8211;gas phase reactions, nonthermal and arc plasma methods, and laser ablation. The physical properties of the nanoparticles, such as shape, size, crystallinity, and optical response, obtained with such synthetic methods are also summarized.

      <title>Exchange&#8208;Biasing in a Dinuclear Dysprosium(III) Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet with a Large Energy Barrier for Magnetisation Reversal
</title>
      <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule magnet: A dichlorido&#8208;bridged dinuclear dysprosium(III) single&#8208;molecule magnet shows a new record of energy barrier for magnetisation reversal for polynuclear single&#8208;molecule magnets. Moreover, the zero&#8208;field tunnelling effect is suppressed by exchange&#8208;biasing effect arising from magnetic coupling interactions between the DyIII centres.







Abstract
A dichlorido&#8208;bridged dinuclear dysprosium(III) single&#8208;molecule magnet [Dy2L2(&#956;&#8208;Cl)2(thf)2] has been made by using a diamine&#8208;bis(phenolate) ligand, H2L. Magnetic studies show an energy barrier for magnetisation reversal (Ueff) around 1000&#8197;K. An exchange&#8208;biasing effect is clearly seen in magnetic hysteresis with steps up to 3&#8197;K. Ab initio calculations exclude the possibility of a pure dipolar origin of this effect leading to the conclusion that super&#8208;exchange through the chloride bridging ligands is important.

      <title>On the Limited Stability of BDPA Radicals</title>
      <dc:description>
Instability of BDPA radicals: 1,3&#8208;Bis(diphenylene)&#8208;2&#8208;phenylallyl (BDPA) radicals have limited persistence both in solution and in the solid state. Decomposition in the solid state was found to be due to oxidation while dimer formation is a significant pathway of decomposition in solution (see figure).







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Bis(diphenylene)&#8208;2&#8208;phenylallyl (BDPA)&#8208;based radicals are of interest as polarizing agents for dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). For this purpose, a BDPA&#8208;nitroxide biradical, employing a phosphodiester linkage, was synthesized. Contrary to what is commonly assumed, BDPA&#8208;derived radicals were observed to have limited stability. Hence, the effects of various factors on the stability of BDPA radicals were investigated. Solvent polarity was found to play a significant role on degradation; a polar BDPA radical was observed to degrade faster in a non&#8208;polar solvent, whereas non&#8208;polar radicals were more unstable in polar solvents. The rate of decomposition was found to increase non&#8208;linearly with increasing radical concentration; a 2&#8208;fold increase in concentration led to a 3&#8208;fold increase in the rate of degradation. Collectively, these results indicate that the dimerization is a significant degradation pathway for BDPA radicals and indeed, a dimer of one BDPA radical was detected by mass spectrometry.

The redox polymer cobaltocene&#8208;functionalized polyallylamine (Cc&#8208;PAA) was utilized to immobilize hydrogenase enzyme on an electrode surface and mediate electron transfer for hydrogen evolution. Cc&#8208;PAA has been found to effectively mediate electron transfer between an electrode and hydrogenases at high specificity and efficiency.

Molecular hydrogen is a major high&#8208;energy carrier for future energy technologies, if produced from renewable electrical energy. Hydrogenase enzymes offer a pathway for bioelectrochemically producing hydrogen that is advantageous over traditional platforms for hydrogen production because of low overpotentials and ambient operating temperature and pressure. However, electron delivery from the electrode surface to the enzyme's active site is often rate&#8208;limiting. Here, it is shown that three different hydrogenases from Clostridium pasteurianum and Methanococcus maripaludis, when immobilized at a cathode in a cobaltocene&#8208;functionalized polyallylamine (Cc&#8208;PAA) redox polymer, mediate rapid and efficient hydrogen evolution. Furthermore, it is shown that Cc&#8208;PAA&#8208;mediated hydrogenases can operate at high faradaic efficiency (80&#8211;100&#8201;%) and low apparent overpotential (&#8722;0.578 to &#8722;0.593&#8197;V vs. SHE). Specific activities of these hydrogenases in the electrosynthetic Cc&#8208;PAA assay were comparable to their respective activities in traditional methyl viologen assays, indicating that Cc&#8208;PAA mediates electron transfer at high rates, to most of the embedded enzymes.

      <title>The Development of Vanadyl Phosphate Cathode Materials for Energy Storage Systems: A Review</title>
      <dc:description>
VOPO4 cathodes: Vanadyl phosphate shows great promise as a cathode material for rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors. The electrochemical performance is closely related to the structures of VOPO4 and types of inserted cations. This review presents the polymorphs of vanadyl phosphate materials, their charge storage behaviors, and the related mechanism investigations.







Abstract
Various cathode materials have been proposed for high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries. Vanadyl phosphate is an important member of the polyanion cathode family. VOPO4 has seven known crystal polymorphs with tunneled or layered frameworks, which allow facile cation (de)intercalations. Two&#8208;electron transfer per formula unit can be realized by using VV/VIV and VIV/VIII redox couples. The electrochemical performance is closely related to the structures of VOPO4 and the types of inserted cations. This Review outlines the crystal structures of VOPO4 polymorphs and their lithiated phases. The research progress of vanadyl phosphate cathode materials for different energy storage systems, including lithium&#8208;ion batteries, sodium&#8208;ion batteries, potassium&#8208;ion batteries, multivalent batteries, and supercapacitors, as well as the related mechanism investigations are summarized. It is hoped that this Review will help with future directions of using vanadyl phosphate materials for energy storage.

      <title>Synthesis and Assembly of Zinc Oxide Microcrystals by a Low&#8208;Temperature Dissolution&#8211;Reprecipitation Process: Lessons Learned About Twin Formation in Heterogeneous Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Conversion of cobalt&#8208;doped layered zinc acetate into zinc oxide: Twinning is an often&#8208;observed process during crystallization or mineralization of ZnO. However, if minor Co doping of a precursor is allowed, a twin free formation of highly regular hexagonal platelets of ZnO microcrystals displaying piezoelectric behavior is observed. Tessellation of these crystals by the Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett technique using n&#8208;butanol is possible, albeit only over small areas, if the surface is covered with a polyelectrolyte prior to deposition. This accounts for a subtle charge&#8208;mediated orientation of these crystals on the substrate. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;J. Schneider et&#8197;al.

      <title>Tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;Fused Heterabuckybowl: Protonation&#8208;Induced Electron Transfer and Self&#8208;Sensitized Photooxidation</title>
      <dc:description>
Double donors: Heterabuckybowl trichalcogenasumanene (D1) and tetrathiafulvalene (D2) electron&#8208;donating moieties are fused together through a pyrazine electron&#8208;accepting unit (A) to give a D1&#8211;A&#8211;D2 type fused &#960;&#8208;system. This system shows interesting transient&#8208;state dynamics owing to the electronic interplay between D1 and D2, and exhibits protonation&#8208;induced electron transfer and self&#8208;sensitized photooxidation behavior that can be spectroscopically observed.







Abstract
The electron donor tetrathiafulvalene (D1) was fused onto the electron&#8208;rich heterabuckybowl trichalcogenasumanene (D2) through an electron&#8208;deficient pyrazine unit (A) to give 1&#8201;c, 1&#8201;d, 2&#8201;c, and 2&#8201;d, featuring the D1&#8211;A&#8211;D2 structure. Both D1 and D2 play a pivotal role in intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) transitions, consequently 1&#8201;c, 2&#8201;d, 2&#8201;c, and 2&#8201;d show a broad ICT band at 450&#8211;720&#8197;nm in steady state. They exhibit two charge&#8208;separated transient states, CS1 and CS2, that appear in sequence. CS1 has a short lifetime (542&#8197;fs), and the D1 moiety on CS1 is in the radical cation state with an absorption maximum (&#955;max) at 889&#8197;nm. CS1 then converts into CS2 (&#955;max, 1105&#8197;nm) through an ICT between D1.+ and D2, affording D1(1&#8722;&#948;).+ and D2&#948;.+. Compounds 1&#8201;c, 1&#8201;d, 2&#8201;c, and 2&#8201;d show protonation&#8208;induced intramolecular electron transfer that leads to absorption at &#955;=700&#8211;1300&#8197;nm. Owing to the existence of an electron&#8208;rich C=C bond on the D1 moiety and in situ generation of 1O2 by the pyrazine&#8208;fused D2 moiety, compounds 1&#8201;c, 1&#8201;d, 2&#8201;c, and 2&#8201;d display self&#8208;sensitized photooxidation in 50&#8197;s.

      <title>Diphenylberyllium Reinvestigated: Structure, Properties, and Reactivity of BePh2, [(12&#8208;crown&#8208;4)BePh]+, and [BePh3]&#8722;</title>
      <dc:description>
Finally, the structure of diphenylberyllium has been determined and its reactivity explored. BePh2 acts as a Lewis acid but with unexpectedly low ether&#8208;affinity. Several triphenylberyllates were characterized, of which one originates from the selfionization of BePh2. The generated phenylberyllium cation exhibits an unusual 4+1 coordination and all compounds are stable in chlorinated solvents (see scheme). These findings enabled a classification of organoberyllium compounds in comparison to the other (pseudo)main group organyles.







Abstract
The first synthesis of BePh2 was accomplished almost a century ago. However, its structure has remained unknown so far, while the corresponding aryls of the elements adjacent to beryllium in the periodic table are well investigated. Herein, we present an improved synthesis for diphenylberyllium and show by X&#8208;ray diffraction that it forms a trinuclear complex in the solid state. NMR spectroscopy revealed that this structure is also retained in solution but exhibits dynamic behavior. Its stability against heat and coordinating solvents is discussed and the possible obstacles to the synthesis of BePh2 from BeCl2 are examined. In the process of this study two ether adducts, BePh2&#8901;Et2O and Be2Ph4&#8901;Et2O, have been characterized as well as the previously unknown triphenylberyllate anion. From the latter several single&#8208;crystal structures were obtained under various conditions, in which [BePh3]&#8722; is either isolated or acts as a ligand for Li+. Furthermore, the crown ether induced selfionization of BePh2 is described and the resulting [(12&#8208;crown&#8208;4)BePh]+ cation was isolated, which shows an unusual 4+1 coordination around the Be atom.

However, its structure has remained unknown so far, while the corresponding aryls of the elements adjacent to beryllium in the periodic table are well investigated. Herein, we present an improved synthesis for diphenylberyllium and show by X&#8208;ray diffraction that it forms a trinuclear complex in the solid state. NMR spectroscopy revealed that this structure is also retained in solution but exhibits dynamic behavior. Its stability against heat and coordinating solvents is discussed and the possible obstacles to the synthesis of BePh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from BeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are examined. In the process of this study two ether adducts, BePh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and Be&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ph&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, have been characterized as well as the previously unknown triphenylberyllate anion. From the latter several single&#8208;crystal structures were obtained under various conditions, in which [BePh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is either isolated or acts as a ligand for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, the crown ether induced selfionization of BePh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is described and the resulting [(12&#8208;crown&#8208;4)BePh]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation was isolated, which shows an unusual 4+1 coordination around the Be atom.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Recent Advances in One&#8208;Electron&#8208;Oxidized CuII&#8211;Diphenoxide Complexes as Models of Galactose Oxidase: Importance of the Structural Flexibility in the Active Site</title>
      <dc:description>
Galactose oxidase (GO) has been widely investigated in terms of biological and model complex studies, due to the unique oxidation state of the CuII&#8211;phenoxyl radical. Although properties and reactivities of the CuII&#8211;phenoxyl radical have been clarified, details of the roles of the other structural factors in the active site of GO are still unclear. Recent progress of model studies on GO is reviewed, focusing on some new aspects of structural factors.







Abstract
The phenoxyl radical plays important roles in biological systems as cofactors in some metalloenzymes, such as galactose oxidase (GO) catalyzing oxidation of primary alcohols to give the corresponding aldehydes. Many metal(II)&#8211;phenoxyl radical complexes have hitherto been studied for understanding the detailed properties and reactivities of GO, and thus the nature of GO has gradually become clearer. However, the effects of the subtle geometric and electronic structural changes at the active site of GO, especially the structural change in the catalytic cycle and the effect of the second coordination sphere, have not been fully discussed yet. In this Review, we focus on further details of the model studies of GO and discuss the importance of the structural change at the active site of GO.

      <dc:description>
Ir&#8208;catalyzed selective alkenylation of cage B(3,6)&#8722;H bonds in o&#8208;carboranes has been achieved for the controlled synthesis of 3,6&#8208;trans&#8208;, 3&#8208;cis&#8208;, and 3&#8208;cis&#8208;6&#8208;trans&#8208;alkenylated o&#8208;carboranes in high yields with excellent regio and very good cis&#8208;trans selectivity. Regioselectivity results from the differences in vertex electron density in o&#8208;carborane, while the configuration of the resultant olefinic units is dominated by the nature of alkyne substituents. Alkyl groups lead to trans&#8208;configuration, whereas bulky aryl substitutions result in cis&#8208;configuration. More information can be found in the Full Paper by R. Cheng, Z. Qiu, and Z. Xie.

      <title>Aqueous Chemical Solution Deposition of Functional Double Perovskite Epitaxial Thin Films</title>
      <dc:description>
Slow films: The use of polymers to control the growth of ceramic thin films can make it easier to produce materials for spintronic applications, which use electron spin instead of charge to carry information. Water&#8208;soluble polymers bind to metal cations and slow down crystallization rates so that the most thermodynamically favored double perovskite structure films, with an optimal orientation and high magnetism for device applications, are formed.







Abstract
Double perovskite structure (A2BB&#8242;O6) oxides exhibit a breadth of multifunctional properties with a huge potential range of applications in fields as diverse as spintronics, magneto&#8208;optic devices, or catalysis, and most of these applications require the use of thin films and heterostructures. Chemical solution deposition techniques are appearing as a very promising methodology to achieve epitaxial oxide thin films combining high performance with high throughput and low cost. In addition, the physical properties of these materials are strongly dependent on the ordered arrangement of cations in the double perovskite structure. Thus, promoting spontaneous cationic ordering has become a relevant issue. In this work, our recent achievements by using polymer&#8208;assisted deposition (PAD) of environmentally friendly, water&#8208;based solutions for the growth of epitaxial ferromagnetic insulating double perovskite La2CoMnO6 and La2NiMnO6 thin films on SrTiO3 and LaAlO3 single&#8208;crystal substrates are presented. It is shown that the particular crystallization and growth process conditions of PAD (very slow rate, close to thermodynamic equilibrium conditions) promote high crystallinity and quality of the films, as well as favors spontaneous B&#8208;site cationic ordering.

      <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Design of a Group&#8197;B Streptococcus Type&#8197;III Synthetic Glycan&#8211;Conjugate Vaccine</title>
      <dc:description>
Group B Streptococcus III has been considered a model of highly complex glycan epitope. Based on the X&#8208;ray crystallographic structure of a polysaccharide fragment&#8208;mAb complex, a hexasaccharide was synthesized comprising the positions involved in binding. After conjugation to a carrier protein and in vivo testing, the oligosaccharide was as efficacious as the natural polysaccharide in inducing protective antibodies. This study underlines the role of structural glycobiology in simplifying the design of vaccines based on complex bacterial polysaccharides. More information can be found in the Full Paper by R.

      <title>Alkynes and Nitrogen Compounds: Useful Substrates for the Synthesis of Pyrazoles</title>
      <dc:description>
One goal: Cyclization reactions of alkynes and nitrogen compounds represent a powerful tool for the preparation of pyrazoles. This Review covers the recent advances in the preparation of pyrazoles starting from alkynes and nitrogen compounds by using transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed or metal&#8208;free conditions to promote the cyclization.







Abstract
The easy preparation and functionalization of pyrazoles associated with their innumerable biological properties have made this class of N&#8208;heterocycles very attractive for the development of new synthetic routes and applications. The cyclization reactions of alkynes and nitrogen compounds represent a powerful tool for the preparation of pyrazoles. This Review covers the recent advances in the preparation of pyrazoles by reacting alkynes and nitrogen compounds under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed or metal&#8208;free conditions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One goal&lt;/b&gt;: Cyclization reactions of alkynes and nitrogen compounds represent a powerful tool for the preparation of pyrazoles. This Review covers the recent advances in the preparation of pyrazoles starting from alkynes and nitrogen compounds by using transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed or metal&#8208;free conditions to promote the cyclization.

      <title>Scope and Limitations of the s&#8208;Block Metal&#8208;Mediated Pudovik Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>
The Pudovik reaction is an atom&#8208;economic addition of phosphane oxides across alkynes, strongly depending on the nature of the s&#8208;block metal, the solvent, the bulkiness of P&#8208;bound groups, and the concentration. Bulky mesityl groups can interact with the newly formed C=C bond of the alkenylphosphane oxides.







Abstract
The hydrophosphorylation of phenylacetylene with di(aryl)phosphane oxides Ar2P(O)H (Pudovik reaction) yields E/Z&#8208;isomer mixtures of phenylethenyl&#8208;di(aryl)phosphane oxides (1). Alkali and alkaline&#8208;earth metal di(aryl)phosphinites have been studied as catalysts for this reaction with increasing activity for the heavier s&#8208;block metals. The Pudovik reaction can only be mediated for di(aryl)phosphane oxides whereas P&#8208;bound alkyl and alcoholate substituents impede the P&#8722;H addition across alkynes. The demanding mesityl group favors the single&#8208;hydrophosphorylated products 1&#8208;Ar whereas smaller aryl substituents lead to the double&#8208;hydrophosphorylated products 2&#8208;Ar. Polar solvents are beneficial for an effective addition. Increasing concentration of the reactants and the catalyst accelerates the Pudovik reaction. Whereas Mes2P(O)H does not form the bis&#8208;phosphorylated product 2&#8208;Mes, activation of an ortho&#8208;methyl group and cyclization occurs yielding 2&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1&#8208;mesityl&#8208;5,7&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophosphindole 1&#8208;oxide (3).

      <title>Importance of Methane Chemical Potential for Its Conversion to Methanol on Cu&#8208;Exchanged Mordenite</title>
      <dc:description>
On the oxidation of methane: Elevated methane pressure increased the chemical potential of methane to enable the activation of two CH4 molecules by two &#956;&#8208;O atoms out of the three contained in a [Cu3(&#956;&#8208;O)3]2+ tricopper&#8208;oxo cluster.







Abstract
Copper&#8208;oxo clusters exchanged in zeolite mordenite are active in the stoichiometric conversion of methane to methanol at low temperatures. Here, we show an unprecedented methanol yield per Cu of 0.6, with a 90&#8211;95&#8201;% selectivity, on a MOR solely containing [Cu3(&#956;&#8208;O)3]2+ active sites. DFT calculations, spectroscopic characterization and kinetic analysis show that increasing the chemical potential of methane enables the utilization of two &#956;&#8208;oxo bridge oxygen out of the three available in the tricopper&#8208;oxo cluster structure. Methanol and methoxy groups are stabilized in parallel, leading to methanol desorption in the presence of water.

      <title>Polar Organofluorine Substituents: Multivicinal Fluorines on Alkyl Chains and Alicyclic Rings</title>
      <dc:description>
Next door neighbours: This Review article summarizes the synthesis and development of multivicinal fluoromethylenes as a new class of organofluorine compounds. An initial focus on alkane chains of this class has developed to alicyclic rings. Important developments are being made in this field, which should facilitate easier and better access to higher order multivicinal fluoroalkanes, offering exciting prospects for the future in both bioactive compounds and materials programmes.







Abstract
This Review outlines the progression, primarily of our own work, but with important contributions from other labs, on the synthesis and properties of multiple vicinally fluorinated alkyl chains and rings. Chain conformations of individual diastereoisomers with &#8208;CHF&#8208; at adjacent carbons are influenced by stereoelectronic factors associated with the polar C&#8722;F bond and the polarised geminal hydrogens. Generally, the chain will prefer a conformation which acts to minimise overall molecular polarity, and where the C&#8722;F bonds orient away from each other. However, when vicinal fluorine atoms are positioned on a ring then conformations are more constrained. The ring will adopt optimal conformations such as a chair in cyclohexane and then C&#8722;F bonds can be introduced with a stereochemistry that forces parallel (axial) orientations. In the case of cyclohexane, 1,3&#8208;diaxial arrangements of C&#8722;F bonds impart considerable polarity to the ring, resulting in an electronegative &#8216;fluorine face&#8217; and an electropositive &#8216;hydrogen face&#8217;. For all&#8208;syn 1,2,3,4,5,6&#8208;hexafluorocyclohexane, this arrangement generates an unusually polar aliphatic ring system. Most recently the concept has been extended to the preparation of all&#8208;syn 1,2,3&#8208;trifluorocyclopropanes, a rigid ring system with fluorine atoms on one face and hydrogens on the other. Lipophilicity Log&#8201;P values of such compounds indicate that they are significantly more polar than their parent alicyclic hydrocarbons and give some positive indication for a future role of such substituents in medicinal chemistry. Expanding to such a role will require access to improved synthesis methods to these motifs and consequently access to a broader a range of building blocks, however some exciting new methods have emerged recently and these are briefly reviewed.

      <title>Selective Catalytic Synthesis of 1,2&#8208; and 8,9&#8208;Cyclic Limonene Carbonates as Versatile Building Blocks for Novel Hydroxyurethanes</title>
      <dc:description>
Biopolymers: The selective catalytic synthesis of limonene&#8208;derived monofunctional cyclic carbonates and their subsequent functionalisation via thiol&#8211;ene addition and amine ring&#8208;opening is reported. The selective catalytic route to monofunctional limonene carbonates gives straightforward access to monomers for novel bio&#8208;based polymers.







Abstract
The selective catalytic synthesis of limonene&#8208;derived monofunctional cyclic carbonates and their subsequent functionalisation via thiol&#8211;ene addition and amine ring&#8208;opening is reported. A phosphotungstate polyoxometalate catalyst used for limonene epoxidation in the 1,2&#8208;position is shown to also be active in cyclic carbonate synthesis, allowing a two&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot synthesis without intermittent epoxide isolation. When used in conjunction with a classical halide catalyst, the polyoxometalate increased the rate of carbonation in a synergistic double&#8208;activation of both substrates. The cis isomer is shown to be responsible for incomplete conversion and by&#8208;product formation in commercial mixtures of 1,2&#8208;limomene oxide. Carbonation of 8,9&#8208;limonene epoxide furnished the 8,9&#8208;limonene carbonate for the first time. Both cyclic carbonates underwent thiol&#8211;ene addition reactions to yield linked di&#8208;monocarbonates, which can be used in linear non&#8208;isocyanate polyurethanes synthesis, as shown by their facile ring&#8208;opening with N&#8208;hexylamine. Thus, the selective catalytic route to monofunctional limonene carbonates gives straightforward access to monomers for novel bio&#8208;based polymers.

      <title>Further Evidence for &#8216;Extended&#8217; Cumulene Complexes: Derivatives from Reactions with Halide Anions and Water</title>
      <dc:description>
The formation of &#8216;quinoidal cumulenes&#8217; is inferred from a series of trapping reactions using ruthenium and iron vinylidene and alkynyl precursors with a variety of nucleophilic and electrophilic species. This is illustrated in the cover artwork (designed by Brady Johnston) by the transformation of a ruthenium vinylidene complex, wherein the terminal alkyne moiety reacts with water to give a corresponding acetyl group. This intriguing process is best rationalised by the formation of an intermediate extended quinoidal cumulene. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;M. Lynam, P.&#8197;J. Low, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.201905399).

      <title>Towards Atomically Precise Supported Catalysts from Monolayer&#8208;Protected Clusters: The Critical Role of the Support</title>

      <title>A Lacunary Polyoxovanadate Precursor and Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Sandwiched Derivatives for Catalytic Oxidation of Sulfides</title>
      <dc:description>
New topology of polyoxovanadates: A rare example of lacunary Keggin&#8208;type vanadoselenite [SeV10O28(SeO3)3]8&#8722; ({Se4V10}) was readily obtained, which shows sufficient reactivity with divalent transition metals (TMs) to form a new series of TM&#8208;sandwiched complexes {(Se4V10)2M} (M=Mn, Co, Zn). Such new TM derivatives can efficiently catalyze the heterogeneous oxidation of sulfides in high conversion and selectivity under mild conditions.







Abstract
A SeO3&#8208;centered lacunary Keggin&#8208;type heteropolyoxovanadate (hetero&#8208;POV) K6H2[SeV10O28(SeO3)3]&#8901;14&#8201;H2O (1) was isolated by one&#8208;pot reaction of KVO3 and SeO2 under acidic conditions. X&#8208;ray studies revealed that it comprised a single {VO5}&#8208;capped trivacant B&#8208;&#945;&#8208;type Keggin ion [SeV9O33(VO)]14&#8722; with its lacunary sites decorated by three {SeO3} pyramids. Interestingly, this new basic hetero&#8208;POV building block was further used as a precursor to assemble with different transition&#8208;metal (TM) ions, yielding a series of TM&#8208;sandwiched POVs K6H8[(SeV10O28(SeO3)3)2(M(H2O)4)]&#8901;24&#8201;H2O (M2+=Mn2+ (2), Co2+ (3), Zn2+ (4)). All four compounds were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis, IR, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), EPR, and 51V&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. Importantly, three TM&#8208;sandwiched derivatives exhibited effective catalytic activity for the heterogeneous oxidative desulfurization of sulfides at room temperature.

X&#8208;ray studies revealed that it comprised a single {VO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}&#8208;capped trivacant B&#8208;&#945;&#8208;type Keggin ion [SeV&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt;(VO)]&lt;sup&gt;14&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; with its lacunary sites decorated by three {SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;} pyramids. Interestingly, this new basic hetero&#8208;POV building block was further used as a precursor to assemble with different transition&#8208;metal (TM) ions, yielding a series of TM&#8208;sandwiched POVs K&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;[(SeV&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;(SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(M(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;24&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (M&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;=Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;)). All four compounds were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis, IR, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), EPR, and &lt;sup&gt;51&lt;/sup&gt;V&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. Importantly, three TM&#8208;sandwiched derivatives exhibited effective catalytic activity for the heterogeneous oxidative desulfurization of sulfides at room temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cystobactamid 507: Concise Synthesis, Mode of Action, and Optimization toward More Potent Antibiotics</title>
      <dc:description>
Optimization of the natural antibiotic cystobactamid 507 targeting DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV was attained by structure&#8211; and conformation&#8212;activity relationship studies. The bioactive conformation was recognized as syn using conformationally locked analogues via intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The new compounds displayed improved target inhibition, antibacterial activity, stability to metabolism and the resistance factor AlbD. Mode of action study revealed that cystobactamids bind to the DNA part of the gyrase&#8211;DNA complex at the minor groove with no intercalation.

      <title>Combining theory and experiment to characterize the voltammetric behavior of nickel anodes in the Simons process</title>
      <dc:description>The Simons process, otherwise known as the electrochemical fluorination (ECF) method, is widely used in industry to electrolytically synthesize chemicals for various purposes. Even to this day, the exact mechanism of the ECF reaction remains unknown, but is believed to involve the formation of an anodic nickel fluoride film with highly oxidized nickel centers. In this study we combine experiments and density functional theory calculations in order to characterize the initial anodic peak occurring at potentials typically required in an ECF cell. NiF  2  is believed to form a passivating layer at low potentials. The calculations show that a potential of +3.1 V is required to oxidize&#160; surface Ni  2+  centers to Ni  3+  .

      <title>Polyhydrido Copper Nanoclusters with a Hollow Icosahedral Core: [Cu30H18{E2P(OR)2}12] (E = S or Se; R = n Pr, i Pr or i Bu)</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we describe the synthesis of a dithiophosphate&#8208;protected copper(I) hydride&#8208;rich nanocluster (NC), [Cu30H18{S2P(O n Pr)2}12] (1H), fully characterized by various spectroscopic methods and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The X&#8208;ray structure of 1H reveals an unprecedented central Cu12 hollow icosahedron. Six faces of this icosahedron are capped by Cu3 triangles, the whole Cu30 core being wrapped by twelve dithiophosphate ligands and the whole cluster has ideal S6 symmetry. The locations of the 18 hydrides in 1H was ascertained by a single crystal neutron diffraction. They are composed of three types: capping &#181;3&#8208;H, interstitial &#181;4&#8208;H (seesaw) and &#181;5&#8208;H ligands (square pyramidal), in good agreement with the DFT simulations. The numbers of hydrides and ligand resonances in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1H are in line with their coordination environment in the solid&#8208;state, retaining the S6 symmetry in solution. Furthermore, two new Se&#8208;protected polyhydrido copper nanoclusters, [Cu30H18{Se2P(OR)2}12] (2H: R = i Pr 3H: R = i Bu) were synthesized from their sulfur relative 1Hvia ligand displacement reaction and their X&#8208;ray structures feature the exceptional case where both the NC shape and size are fully conserved during the course of ligand exchange. In addition, the reaction of 1H with [Pd(PPh3)2Cl2] in the presence of terminal alkynes led to the formation of new bimetallic Cu&#8208;Pd alloy clusters [PdCu14H2{S2P(O n Pr)2}6(C&#8801;CR)6] (4: R = Ph; 5: R = C6H4F).</dc:description>

      <title>Balancing Ligand Flexibility Versus Rigidity for the Step&#8208;Wise Self&#8208;Assembly of M12L24 Via M6L12 Metal&#8208;Organic Cages</title>
      <dc:description>Non&#8208;covalent interactions are important for directing protein folding across multiple intermediates and can even provide access to multiple stable structures with different properties and functions. Herein, we describe an approach for mimicking this behavior in the self&#8208;assembly of metal&#8208;organic cages. Two ligands whose bend angles are controlled by non&#8208;covalent interactions and one ligand lacking the above&#8208;mentioned interactions were synthesized and used for self&#8208;assembly with Pd  2+  . As these weak interactions are easily broken, the bend angles have a controlled flexibility giving access to M  2  (  L1  )  4  , M  6  (  L2  )  12  , and M  12  (  L2  )  24  cages. By controlling the self&#8208;assembly conditions this process can be directed in a stepwise fashion. Additionally, the multiple endohedral hydrogen bonding sites on the ligand were found to play a role in the binding and discrimination of neutral guests.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Non&#8208;covalent interactions are important for directing protein folding across multiple intermediates and can even provide access to multiple stable structures with different properties and functions. Herein, we describe an approach for mimicking this behavior in the self&#8208;assembly of metal&#8208;organic cages. Two ligands whose bend angles are controlled by non&#8208;covalent interactions and one ligand lacking the above&#8208;mentioned interactions were synthesized and used for self&#8208;assembly with Pd  2+  . As these weak interactions are easily broken, the bend angles have a controlled flexibility giving access to M  2  (  L1  )  4  , M  6  (  L2  )  12  , and M  12  (  L2  )  24  cages. By controlling the self&#8208;assembly conditions this process can be directed in a stepwise fashion. Additionally, the multiple endohedral hydrogen bonding sites on the ligand were found to play a role in the binding and discrimination of neutral guests.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Mechanism of an Elusive Solvent Effect in Organozinc Reagent Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Solvent effects are often difficult to understand in cases where reaction intermediates, and thus their differential behaviour in different solvents, are not directly observable by traditional ensemble analytical techniques. Herein, the sensitivity of single&#8208;particle fluorescence microscopy uniquely enables direct observation of organozinc intermediates and solvent effects on their build&#8208;up and persistence. When combined with NMR spectroscopy, these imaging data pinpoint the previously elusive mechanistic origin of solvent effects in the synthesis of widely used organozinc reagents. These findings characterize the acceleration of oxidative addition of the starting organoiodide to the surface of zinc metal in DMSO relative to THF, but once formed, surface intermediates display similar persistence in either solvent. The current studies are the first demonstration of a highly sensitive, single&#8208;particle fluorescence microscopy technique to pinpoint otherwise elusive solvent effects in synthetic chemistry.</dc:description>

      <title>Stabilizing DNAzymes through Encapsulation in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
      <dc:description>DNAzymes are a promising class of bioinspired catalyst; however, their structural instability limits their potential. Herein, we report a method to stabilize DNAzymes by encapsulating them in a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) host. This biomimetic mineralization process makes DNAzymes active under a wider range of conditions.

The stabilized DNAzymes show activities in the presence of Exonuclease I, organic solvents, or high temperature. Due to its elevated stability and heterogeneous phase, we are able to perform catalysis under a continuous&#8208;flow condition, and the DNAzyme can be reactivated in situ by introducing K+. Moreover, we found that the encapsulated DNAzyme maintains its high enantiomer selectivity, demonstrated by the sulfoxidation of thioanisole to (S)&#8208;methyl phenyl sulfoxide. This concept of stabilizing DNAzymes expands their potential application in chemical industry.</dc:description>

      <title>Grafting of lanthanum complexes on a functionalised graphene surface : theoretical investigation on Ethylene and 1,3&#8208;Butadiene homo&#8208; and co&#8208;polymerisation.</title>
      <dc:description>Compared to silica and alumina, graphene has received little attention as catalyst support, although it may represent a good candidate in view of its inertness, its good mechanical and thermal properties and its extended &#960; conjugated system. While lanthanide catalysts grafted on silica have been synthetized and theoretically investigated, the grafting mode of La complexes onto graphene surfaces remains unknown. To shed light on this reaction, we report here a computational density functional theory study on the grafting of the [La(N(SiMe3)2)3] compound on graphene &#8208;OH and COOH functionalised surfaces. Similarly to experimental approaches, the Lewis acidity of these two supported complexes has been probed by coordination of triphenylphosphine oxide and compared with that of silica grafted analogues. In order to investigate the role of the graphene support in the catalytic activity of the corresponding grafted systems, we have then computed the homo&#8208; and co&#8208;polymerization reaction of ethylene and 1,3&#8208;butadiene. These compounds efficiently catalyse the ethylene and 1,3&#8208;butadiene homopolymerization, displaying activation barriers which are significantly lower than those reported for silica grafted compounds. The copolymerization reaction has been finally investigated. The results computed show that the high stability of the allylic products prevents the formation of alternating ethylene/butadiene copolymers, allowing the formation of block copolymers.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning Aqueous Supramolecular Polymerization by an Acid&#8208;responsive Conformational Switch</title>
      <dc:description>Besides their widespread use in coordination chemistry, 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridines are known for their ability to undergo  cis&#8208;trans  conformational changes in response to metal ions and acids, which has been primarily investigated at the molecular level.

Herein, we have pioneered the use of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridines as acid&#8208;responsive conformational switches to tune supramolecular polymerization processes. To achieve this goal, we have designed a bipyridine&#8208;based linear bolaamphiphile  1  that forms ordered supramolecular polymers in aqueous media  via  cooperative aromatic and hydrophobic interactions. Interestingly, addition of acid (TFA) induces the monoprotonation of the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine moiety, leading to a switch in the molecular conformation from a linear (  trans  ) to a V&#8208;shaped (  cis  ) state. This increase in molecular distortion along with electrostatic repulsions of the positively charged bipyridine&#8208;H  +  units attenuate the aggregation tendency and induces a transformation from long fibers to shorter thinner fibers.

      <title>Electrochemistry of Electrode Materials Containing S&#8208;Se Bonds for Rechargeable Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Sulfur (S) and selenium (Se) have been considered as promising high&#8208;capacity cathode materials for rechargeable batteries. They have differences in physical properties (  e.g.  , electronic conductivity) but the same number of electrons in their outermost shells which lead to similarity in electrochemical behavior in batteries. In recent years, some efforts have been taken to combine them in electrodes in the hope of improved battery performance. The S&#8208;Se bonds of these electrode materials lead to unusual properties and intriguing electrochemical behavior, which have attracted increasing interest. In this Minireview, we summarize the electrode materials containing S&#8208;Se bonds including inorganic S  x  Se  y  &#160;solid solutions, organic compounds, and organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials. Our understanding in these materials is still premature, but they have shown unique properties to be electrode materials. We hope this Minireview could provide a new insight into the design, synthesis, and understanding of these materials which could enable high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries.</dc:description>

In recent years, some efforts have been taken to combine them in electrodes in the hope of improved battery performance. The S&#8208;Se bonds of these electrode materials lead to unusual properties and intriguing electrochemical behavior, which have attracted increasing interest. In this Minireview, we summarize the electrode materials containing S&#8208;Se bonds including inorganic S  x  Se  y  &#160;solid solutions, organic compounds, and organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials. Our understanding in these materials is still premature, but they have shown unique properties to be electrode materials. We hope this Minireview could provide a new insight into the design, synthesis, and understanding of these materials which could enable high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Regulation of ambient light&#8211;induced photocyclization pathway (Norrish&#8208;Yang vs. 6&#960;) by substituent choice</title>
      <dc:description>A series of donor/acceptor chromophores 1d&#8211;3d containing two types of photoresponsive motifs, namely an electron&#8208;deficient BF2&#8208;chelated ketone fused with an electron&#8208;rich thiophene have been synthesized and their photochromic performance are investigated. The results reveal that simple variation of R substituents on the diaryl moiety allows one to control the intramolecular photocyclization mechanism with high photochemical selectivity, e.g., under ambient light, methyl&#8208;substituted 1d and 2d undergo 6&#960; photocyclization, whereas ethyl&#8208;substituted 3d exclusively undergoes Norrish&#8208;Yang photocyclization. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of Norrish&#8208;Yang cyclization products reveals the formation of four pairs of conformational enantiomers differing in the dihedral angle between benzothiophene and the BF2 core. The UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra of 1d&#8211;3d cover a broad visible light region (380&#8211;572 nm), while theoretical calculations reveal that absorption in this region is dominated by the charge transfer (CT) transition from the thiophene&#8208;centered HOMO to the LUMO of the electron&#8208;deficient &#960;&#8208;conjugated BF2&#8208;chelated unit. The spatial separation of the HOMO and LUMO of these dyes promotes&#160;triplet state generation and self&#8208;photosensitizes intramolecular photocyclization in the visible light region. Three&#8208;dimensional time&#8208;resolved and steady&#8208;state emission spectra of 3d show that the Norrish&#8208;Yang photocyclization takes place within milliseconds with excellent conversion efficiency (96%).</dc:description>

The two latter techniques unequivocally demonstrate that [Fe(phtmeimb)  2  ](PF  6  )  2  is a  triplet  Fe(IV) low&#8208;spin  S  =1 complex in the ground state, in agreement with quantum chemical calculations.

      <title>Impact of chirality on hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular assemblies and photoconductivity of diketopyrrolopyrrole derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>Hydrogen bonds can efficiently guide the self&#8208;assembly of organic materials, being possible to tune the properties during the aggregation process. In the case of &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials, several parameters such as temperature, concentration and solvent can be used to modify the aggregation state while tuning the optoelectronic properties. Chirality can be included within the impacting parameters due to the differences in molecular packing. Here we design and synthesize chiral and achiral thiophene&#8208;capped diketopyrrolopyrrole derivatives containing amide bonds with the aim to study the interplay between chiral assemblies and their stabilization via hydrogen&#8208;bonding. Differences in aggregation properties were observed with spectroscopy and microscopy, and a contactless microwave&#8208;based technique was used to study their intrinsic charge carrier mobility. The positive role of hydrogen&#8208;bonding has been highlighted and the differences between chiral and achiral compounds have been elucidated.</dc:description>

Here we design and synthesize chiral and achiral thiophene&#8208;capped diketopyrrolopyrrole derivatives containing amide bonds with the aim to study the interplay between chiral assemblies and their stabilization via hydrogen&#8208;bonding. Differences in aggregation properties were observed with spectroscopy and microscopy, and a contactless microwave&#8208;based technique was used to study their intrinsic charge carrier mobility. The positive role of hydrogen&#8208;bonding has been highlighted and the differences between chiral and achiral compounds have been elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Glycerol boosted Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydroaminomethylation reaction, a mechanistic insight</title>
      <dc:description>In this contribution, we report a Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydroaminomethylation reaction of terminal alkenes in glycerol that proceeds efficiently under mild conditions to produce the corresponding amines in relatively high selectivity towards linear amines, moderate to excellent yields using a low catalyst loading (1 mol% [Rh], 2 mol% phosphine) and relative low pressure (H2/CO, 1:1, total pressure 10 bar). This work sheds light on the importance of glycerol in enabling enamine reduction via hydrogen transfer. Moreover, the crucial role of Rh as chemoselective catalyst in the condensation step has been evidenced for the first time in the frame of the hydroaminomethylation reaction by precluding deleterious aldol condensation reactions. The hydroaminomethylation proceeds under a molecular regime; the outcome of catalytically active species into metal&#8208;based nanoparticles renders the catalytic system inactive.</dc:description>

      <title>Trifluorosulfonylation Cascade in Allenols: Stereocontrolled Synthesis of Bis(triflyl)enones</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we report investigations embodying the first example of reversal of the native regioselectivity in the reaction of allenols with electrophiles. The effortlessness of C&#8211;C bond formation, mild reaction conditions, neither catalysts nor light irradiation, exquisite selectivity, both in terms of functional group tolerance and chemo&#8208;, site&#8208;, and stereo&#8208;selectivity, converts this trifluorosulfonylation sequence into an appealing protocol for the preparation of novel functionalized enones.

      <title>Regioselective 3&#8208;O&#8208;Substitution of Unprotected Thiodigalactosides: Direct Route to Galectin Inhibitors</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of tailored bioactive carbohydrates usually comprises challenging (de)protection steps, lowering synthetic yields and increasing time demands. We present here a regioselective single&#8208;step introduction of benzylic substituents at 3&#8208;hydroxy groups of &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;galactopyranosyl&#8208;(1&#8594;1)&#8208;thio&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;galactopyranoside (TDG) employing dibutyltin oxide in good yields. These glycomimetics act as inhibitors of galectins &#8208; human lectins, which are biomedically attractive targets for therapeutic inhibition in e.g. cancerogenesis. The affinity of prepared glycomimetics to galectin&#8208;1 and galectin&#8208;3 was studied in ELISA&#8208;type assay and their potential to inhibit galectin binding on the cell surface was shown. There we used our original  in vivo  biotinylated galectin constructs for easy detection by flow cytometry. The results of biological experiments were compared with data from molecular modeling with both galectins. The present work reveals a facile and elegant synthetic route for the preparation of TDG&#8208;derived glycomimetics that exhibit differing selectivity and affinity to galectins depending on the choice of 3&#8208;  O  &#8208;substitution.</dc:description>

A series of biochemical assays, aimed at defining the cellular targets of these palladium complexes, has shown that mitochondria are damaged before DNA, therefore revealing a behavior substantially different from that of cisplatin and derivatives.

      <title>Enhancing the CO2&#8208;electroreduction of Fe/Ni&#8208;pentlandite Catalysts by S/Se exchange</title>
      <dc:description>The electrochemical reduction of CO  2  &#160;is an attractive strategy towards the mitigation of environmental pollution and production of bulk chemicals as well as fuels by renewables. The bimetallic sulfide Fe  4.5  Ni  4.5  S  8&#160;  (pentlandite) was recently reported as a cheap and robust catalyst for electrochemical water splitting, as well as for CO  2  &#160;reduction with a solvent&#8208;dependent product selectivity. Inspired by numerous reports&#160; on&#160; monometallic sulfoselenides and selenides revealing higher catalytic activity for the CO  2  &#160;reduction reaction (CO  2  RR) than their sulfide counterparts, we herein investigated the influence of stepwise S/Se exchange in seleno&#8209;pentlandites Fe  4.5  Ni  4.5  S  8&#8209;Y  Se  Y  &#160;(Y=1&#8209;5) and their ability to act as CO  2  &#160;reducing catalysts. We herein demonstrate that the incorporation of higher equivalents of selenium favors the CO  2  RR with Fe  4.5  Ni  4.5  S  4  Se  4  &#160;revealing the highest activity for CO formation. Under galvanostatic conditions in acetonitrile, Fe  4.5  Ni  4.5  S  4  Se  4&#160;  generates CO with a Faradaic Efficiency close to 100% at an applied current densities&#160;of&#160;&#8208;50&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8208;2&#160;and 1 00&#160;mA&#160;cm  &#8208;2  .

      <title>A Supramolecular Model for the Co&#8208;Catalytic Role of Nitro Compounds in Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalyzed Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>Nitro compounds are known to change reaction rates and kinetic concentration dependence of Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Yet, no mechanistic model exists to account for these observations. Herein we present an atomistic model for the catalytically active form for an alcohol dehydroazidation reaction, generated by DFT calculations. which consists of an H&#8208;bonded aggregate of two molecules of Br&#248;nsted acid and two molecules of nitro compound. The computed O&#8208;H stretching frequencies for the aggregate indicate they are stronger acids than the individual acid molecules and serve as excellent predictors for experimental reaction rates. Applying the model to a chemically diverse set of potential promoters, we predicted and verified experimentally that sulfate esters induce a similar co&#8208;catalytic effect. The important implication is that Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid catalysis must be viewed from a supramolecular perspective that accounts for not only the pKa of the acid and the bulk properties of a solvent, but also the weak interactions between all molecules in solution.</dc:description>

      <title>Single peptide backbone surrogate mutations to regulate angiotensin GPCR subtype selectivity</title>
      <dc:description>Mutating the side&#8208;chains of amino acids in a peptide ligand, with unnatural amino acids, aiming to mitigate its short half&#8208;life is an established approach. However, we hypothesized that mutating specific backbone peptide bonds with bioisosters can be exploited not only to enhance the proteolytic stability of parent peptides, but also to tune its receptor subtype selectivity. Towards this end, we synthesized four [Y]  6  &#8208;Angiotensin II analogs where amide bonds have been replaced by 1,4&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazole isosteres in four different backbone locations. All the analogs possessed enhanced stability in human plasma in comparison with the parent peptide, whereas only two of them achieved enhanced AT  2  R/AT  1  R subtype selectivity. This diversification has been studied through 2D NMR spectroscopy and unveiled a putative more structured microenvironment for the two selective ligands accompanied with increased number of NOE cross&#8208;peaks. The most potent analog, compound 2, has been explored regarding its neurotrophic potential and resulted in an enhanced neurite growth with respect to the established agent C21.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mutating the side&#8208;chains of amino acids in a peptide ligand, with unnatural amino acids, aiming to mitigate its short half&#8208;life is an established approach. However, we hypothesized that mutating specific backbone peptide bonds with bioisosters can be exploited not only to enhance the proteolytic stability of parent peptides, but also to tune its receptor subtype selectivity. Towards this end, we synthesized four [Y]  6  &#8208;Angiotensin II analogs where amide bonds have been replaced by 1,4&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazole isosteres in four different backbone locations. All the analogs possessed enhanced stability in human plasma in comparison with the parent peptide, whereas only two of them achieved enhanced AT  2  R/AT  1  R subtype selectivity. This diversification has been studied through 2D NMR spectroscopy and unveiled a putative more structured microenvironment for the two selective ligands accompanied with increased number of NOE cross&#8208;peaks. The most potent analog, compound 2, has been explored regarding its neurotrophic potential and resulted in an enhanced neurite growth with respect to the established agent C21.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Construction of Axially Chiral Indole&#8208;Based Frameworks: An Emerging Area</title>
      <dc:description>Axially chiral indole&#8208;based frameworks have been recognized as a class of important five&#8208;membered (hetero)biaryls, and developing catalytic asymmetric approaches for constructing these frameworks in an enantioselective manner is highly desirable. In recent years, synthetic chemists have paid much attention to this research field, and rapid developments have occurred. At this point, a range of axially chiral indole&#8208;based scaffolds have been constructed via various catalytic asymmetric reactions based on different strategies.

      <title>Aggregation and amyloidogenicity of nuclear coactivator binding domain of CREB&#8208;binding protein.</title>
      <dc:description>Nuclear coactivator binding domain (NCBD) of transcriptional co&#8208;regulator CREB&#8208;binding protein (CBP) is an example of conformationally malleable protein that can bind to structurally unrelated protein targets and adopt distinct folds in the respective protein complexes.

To reveal the concealed aggregation potential of NCBD we used chemically synthesized mirror&#8208;image&#160;  D  &#8208;NCBD form. The addition of&#160;  D  &#8208;NCBD promoted self&#8208;assembly into amyloid precipitates presumably due to formation of thermodynamically more stable racemic &#946;&#8208;sheet structures.

      <title>Improving Broadband White&#8208;light Emission Performances of 2D Perovskites by Subtly Regulating Organic Cations</title>
      <dc:description>Recently, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites have attracted intensive attentions in solid state luminous fields as single&#8208;component white light emitters, and it is still significant to rationally optimize the photoluminescence (PL) performances through accurate structural design strategies. Herein, by carefully choosing homologous aliphatic amines as templates, we rationally designed two isotypical perovskites, [DMEDA]PbCl  4  (  1  ) and [DMPDA]PbCl  4  (  2  ), displaying tunable and stable broadband bluish white&#8208;light emission properties. Intriguingly, the subtle regulation on organic cations leads to higher distortion levels of 2D [PbCl  4  ]  2&#8208;  layers and enhanced photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (PLQEs) (&lt;1% for  1  and 4.9% for  2  ). The broadband light emissions can be ascribed to the self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) based on detailed studies of structural characterizations, time&#8208;resolved PL, temperature&#8208;dependent PL emissions, theoretical calculation and so on. This work gives a new guidance to rationally optimize the PL properties of low&#8208;dimensional halide perovskites and affords a platform to probe into the structure&#8208;property relationship.</dc:description>

Intriguingly, the subtle regulation on organic cations leads to higher distortion levels of 2D [PbCl  4  ]  2&#8208;  layers and enhanced photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (PLQEs) (&amp;lt;1% for  1  and 4.9% for  2  ). The broadband light emissions can be ascribed to the self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) based on detailed studies of structural characterizations, time&#8208;resolved PL, temperature&#8208;dependent PL emissions, theoretical calculation and so on. This work gives a new guidance to rationally optimize the PL properties of low&#8208;dimensional halide perovskites and affords a platform to probe into the structure&#8208;property relationship.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship Study of a Potent &#945;&#8208;Thrombin Binding Aptamer Incorporating Hexitol Nucleotides</title>
      <dc:description>the replacement of one or more nucleotide residues in the potent &#945;&#8208;thrombin&#8208;binding aptamer NU172 with hexitol&#8208;based nucleotides has been devised, studying the effect of these substitutions on the physicochemical and functional properties of the anticoagulant agent. The incorporation of single hexitol nucleotides at T9 and G18 positions of NU172 substantially retained the physicochemical features of the parent oligonucleotide, as a result of the biomimetic properties of the hexitol backbone. Importantly, the NU172&#8208;  T  H  9 mutant exhibited a higher binding affinity toward human &#945;&#8208;thrombin than the native aptamer and an improved stability even after 24 h in 90% human serum, with a significant increase in the estimated half&#8208;life. The anticoagulant activity of the modified oligonucleotide was also found as slightly preferable than NU172. Overall, these results confirm the potential of hexitol nucleotides as biomimetic agents, while laying the foundations for the development of NU172&#8208;inspired &#945;&#8208;thrombin&#8208;binding aptamers.</dc:description>

      <title>Hierarchical Nanoflower Arrays of Co9S8&#8208;Ni3S2 on Nickel Foam: Highly Efficient Binder&#8208;free Electrocatalyst for Overall Water Splitting Application</title>
      <dc:description>Here, we have explored the synthesis of highly efficient Co9S8&#8208;Ni3S2&#160;based hierarchical nanoflower arrays on nickel foam (NF) through the one&#8208;pot hydrothermal method (Co9S8&#8208;Ni3S2/NF) for overall water splitting applications.&#160;&#160;The overpotentials exhibited by this system at 25 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;are nearly 277 and 102 mV for HER and OER, respectively in 1 M KOH solution. Subsequently, the overall water splitting was performed in 1 M KOH solution by employing Co9S8&#8208;Ni3S2/NF as both the anode and cathode electrodes, where the system required only 1.49, 1.60 and 1.69 V to deliver the current densities of 10, 25, and 50 mA cm&#8208;2, respectively.

      <dc:description>Structural analysis of modern pharmaceutical practices allows for the identification of two rapidly growing trends: the introduction of tailor&#8208;made amino acids and the exploitation of fluorinated motifs. Quite curiously, the former represents one of the most ubiquitous classes of naturally occurring compounds while the latter is the most xenobiotic, comprised virtually entirely of man&#8208;made derivatives.

      <title>Bismuth Oxide decorated Graphene Oxide Hybrids for Catalytic and Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2</title>
      <dc:description>Global warming challenges aggregate demand to develop an efficient catalytic system for the reduce CO2, which significantly contributes to the control of climate change. Herein, as&#8208;synthesized bismuth oxide decorated graphene oxide (Bi2O3@GO) has been used as an electro/thermal catalyst for CO2 reduction. Bi2O3@GO was found to be uniformly distributed and confirmed by scanning electron and transmission electron microscopic analysis. The X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) exhibits the Bi2O3 has the &#946;&#8208;phase with 23.4 m2/g BET surface area. Significantly, the D and G bands from Raman spectroscopic analysis and their intensity (ID/IG) ratio have been revealed the increment in defective sites on GO after the surface decoration. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) analysis clearly shows signals for Bi, C and O, along with their oxidation states. The ultra&#8208;low onset potential (&#8208;0.534 V vs. RHE) for the reduction of CO2 on Bi2O3@GO has been achieved. Furthermore, potential dependent (&#8208;0.534, &#8208;0.734 and &#8208;0.934 vs. RHE) bulk electrolysis of CO2 to formate provides Faradaic efficiencies (FE) of ~ 39.72, ~ 61.48 and ~83.00% respectively. Additionally, the time&#8208;dependent electrolysis at a poteintial of &#8208;0.934 vs. RHE for 3 and 5h observed FEs are ~ 84.20% and ~ 87.17% respectively. This catalyst was also used for the thermal reduction of CO2 to formate. It shows that the thermal reduction provides a path for the industrial applications as this catalyst converts a large amount of CO2 to formate (10 mM).</dc:description>

      <title>The highly graphitized porous carbon&#8208;FeNi3 fabricated from oleic acid for advanced lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Improving electrical conductivity of sulfur, suppressing shuttle/dissolution of polysulfide and enhancing reaction kinetics in Li&#8208;S batteries are essential for practical application. Herein, for the first time, we use low cost oleic acid as single carbon source, and add commercial SiO  2  as template to form porous structure while introducing  Fe(NO  3  )  3  and Ni(NO  3  )  2  as catalysts to increase the degree of graphitization. In addition, double metal salts Fe(NO  3  )  3  and Ni(NO  3  )  2  can also form FeNi  3  alloy, and our results show the FeNi  3  nanoparticles could accelerate the kinetic conversion reactions of polysulfide. Thanks to the well&#8208;developed porous structure with high graphitization degree, the highly  graphitized porous carbon  &#8208;  FeNi  3  (  GPC&#8208;FeNi  3  ) materials have high conductivity to ensure fast charge transfer while hierarchically porous structure facilitates ion diffusion and traps polysulfide. Thus, the GPC&#8208;FeNi  3  /S cathode displays excellent electrochemical performance. Under the current rate of 0.2 C and 1 C, the cathode of the GPC&#8208;FeNi  3  /S composites with sulfur content of 70% delivers high initial discharge capacities of 1108 and 880 mAh g  &#8722;1  , and retains reversible specific capacities of 850 mAh g  &#8722;1  after 200 cycles at 0.2 C and 625 mAh g  &#8722;1  after 400 cycles at 1C.</dc:description>

      <title>Effect of an Aromatic Solvent on Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Directed Supramolecular Polymerization Leading to Distinct Topologies</title>
      <dc:description>Transcending phenomenon, self&#8208;assembly of synthetic molecules is now becoming an essential tool to design supramolecular materials not only in the thermodynamically stable state but also in kinetically trapped states. However, an approach to design complex self&#8208;assembly comprising different types of self&#8208;assembled states remains elusive. Herein we demonstrate an example of such systems based on our unique supramolecular polymer mediated by supermacrocyclization of hydrogen&#8208;bonding &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule. By adding an aromatic solvent in nonpolar solutions of monomer, spontaneous nucleation triggered by the supermacrocyclization was suppressed so that isothermal supramolecular polymerization could be achieved from kinetically formed topological variants and amorphous agglomerates to afford helicoidal structures hitherto obtainable only with very slow cooling of a hot solution. By increasing the proportion of aromatic solvent further, we could find another self&#8208;assembly path based on competing extended hydrogen&#8208;bonded motifs to afford crystalline nanowires.</dc:description>

      <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH)&#8208;Based Planar Chiral Bent Cyclophanes by Rhodium&#8208; Catalyzed [2+2+2] Cycloaddition</title>
      <dc:description>The enantioselective synthesis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)&#8208;based planar chiral cyclophanes was achieved for the first time by the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular regio&#8208; and enantioselective [2+2+2] cycloaddition of tethered diyne&#8208; benzofulvenes followed by stepwise oxidative transformations. The thus synthesized p&#8208;terphenyl&#8208; and 9&#8208;fluorenone&#8208;based planar chiral bent cyclophanes were converted to 9&#8208;fluorenol&#8208;based ones with excellent ee values of &gt;99% by diastereoselective 1,2&#8208;reduction. These 9&#8208;fluorenol&#8208;based cyclophanes exhibited high fluorescence quantum yields, which were significantly higher than that of an acyclic reference molecule (78&#8211;82% vs. 48%). The bending effect on the chiroptical property was also examined, which revealed that the anisotropy factors (gabs values) for electronic circular dichroism (ECD) of these 9&#8208;fluorenol&#8208;based planar chiral bent cyclophanes increase as the tether length becomes shorter.</dc:description>

      <title>Boronic Acids as Lewis Acid Catalysts: Myth or Reality?</title>
      <dc:description>Boronic acid catalysis has emerged as a mild method for promoting a wide variety of reactions. It has been proposed that the mode of catalysis involves Lewis acid or covalent activation of hydroxyl groups by boron, but limited mechanistic evidence exists. Here, we reinvestigate representative boronic acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions of alcohols and oximes. We interpret a series of control experiments with boronic and Br&#248;nsted acids along with correlations between their reactivity and their acidity measured by the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method. Overall, we conclude that the major modes of catalysis involve either dual H&#8208;bond catalysis or Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. We show that strong Br&#248;nsted acids are generated in situ from covalent assembly of the boronic acids with hexafluoroisopropanol, explaining why the solvent had such a major impact on the reactivity. This new insight should guide the future development of boronic acid catalysis, where the diverse and solvent&#8208;specific nature of catalytic modes has been overlooked.</dc:description>

      <title>An Upgraded &#8220;Two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; Strategy Toward Highly Crystalline Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>A highly crystalline bicarbazole&#8208;based covalent organic framework (BCzP&#8208;COF) was synthesized  via  an upgraded &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; strategy by the self&#8208;polycondensation of A  2  B  2  mononer with two neopentyl acetal and two amine groups. Such strategy is propitious to afford higher crystallinity, larger special surface areas and better morphology than that of using unprotected monomer with free aldehydes and amines. Additionally, the off&#8208;white powder of BCzP&#8208;COF could serve as acidichromism sensor with a significant color change. Intriguingly, the conductivity of the protonated BCzP&#8208;COF can improve six orders of magnitude compared to that of the pristine samples.

      <title>Controlling the length of cooperative supramolecular polymers with chain&#8208;cappers</title>
      <dc:description>The design and the characterization of supramolecular additives to control the chain length of benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) cooperative supramolecular polymers under thermodynamic equilibrium is unraveled. These additives act as chain&#8208;cappers of supramolecular polymers and feature one face as reactive as the BTA discotic to interact strongly with the polymer&#8208;end, whereas the other face is non&#8208;reactive and therefore impedes further polymerization. Such a design requires fine tuning of the conformational pre&#8208;organization of the amides and the steric hindrance of the motif. The chain&#8208;cappers studied are monotopic derivatives of BTA, modified by partial  N  &#8208;methylation of the amides or by positioning of a bulky cyclotriveratrylene cage on one face of the BTA unit. This study not only clarifies the interplay between structural variations and supramolecular interactions, but it also highlights the necessity to combine orthogonal characterization methods, spectroscopy and light scattering, to elucidate the structures and compositions of supramolecular systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Conformation control of conjugated polymers</title>
      <dc:description>In the past few decades, conjugated polymers have aroused extensive interest in organic electronic applications. The electrical performance of conjugated polymers has a close relationship with their backbone conformation. The conformation of the polymer backbone strongly affects the &#960;&#173;electron delocalization along polymer chains, the energy bandgap, interchain interactions, and further affecting charge transport properties. To realize a rigid coplanar backbone that usually possesses efficient intrachain charge transport properties and enhanced &#960;&#8208;&#960; stackings, such conformation control becomes a useful strategy to achieve the high&#8208;performance (semi)conducting polymers. This review summarizes the most important polymer structures through conformation control at molecular levels, and then divides these rigid coplanar conjugated polymers into three categories: 1) non&#8208;covalent interactions locked conjugated polymers; 2) double&#8208;bond linked conjugated polymers; 3) ladder conjugated polymers. The effect of the conformation control on physical nature, optoelectronic properties, and their device performance is also discussed, as well as the challenges of chemical synthesis and structural characterization.</dc:description>
