         <title>Liquid&#8208;Free, Self&#8208;repairable, Recyclable, and Highly Stretchable Colorless Solid Ionic Conductive Elastomers for Strain/Temperature Sensors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state ionic conductive elastomers (ICEs) can fundamentally overcome the disadvantages of hydrogels and ionogels (their liquid components tend to leak or evaporate), and are considered to be ideal materials for flexible ionic sensors. In this study, a liquid&#8208;free ionic polyurethane (PU) type conductive elastomer (ICE&#8208;2) was synthesized and studied. The polyurethane (PU) type matrix with microphase separation endowed ICE&#8208;2 with excellent mechanical versatility. The disulfide bond exchange reaction in the hard phase and intermolecular hydrogen bonds contributed to damage repairing ability. ICE&#8208;2 exhibited good ionic conductivity (2.86 &#215; 10&#8208;6 S/cm), high transparency (average transmittance &gt; 89%, 400~800 nm), excellent mechanical properties (tensile strength of 3.06 MPa, elongation at break of 1760%, and fracture energy of 14.98 kJ/m2), appreciable self&#8208;healing ability (healing efficiency &gt; 90%), satisfactory environmental stability, and outstanding recyclability. The sensor constructed by ICE&#8208;2 could not only realize the perception of temperature changes, but also accurately and sensitively detect various human activities, including joint movements and micro&#8208;expression changes. This study provides a simple and effective strategy for the development of flexible and soft ionic conductors for sensors and human&#8208;machine interfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Bismuth Infrared Star: being at a glance.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bismuth polycations have garnered significant attention from researchers due to their extraordinary and counter&#8208;intuitive structures and stoichiometries. Despite extensive experimental and theoretical investigations, our understanding of the bonding in such clusters remains insufficient. In this study, we conducted an AdNDP bonding analysis to elucidate the bonding characteristics using both homoatomic and heteroatomic bismuth clusters with various stoichiometries. By analyzing the calculated nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shift data, we confirmed the aromatic nature of these species. We identified some universal bonding patterns that can be applied to a range of homoatomic and heteroatomic bismuth clusters. Additionally, we performed calculations of absorbance and fluorescence spectra to gain insights into the near&#8208;infrared emission and establish a potential correlation between absorbance and the identified bonding patterns.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;covalent Supramolecular 1D Alternating Copolymer in Crystal toward 2D Anisotropic Photon Transport</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To realize organic integrated optoelectronic circuits, there is a need for anisotropic optical waveguides at the micro/nanoscale. Anisotropic alignment of one&#8208;dimensional (1D)&#8208;ordered supramolecular structures composed of light&#8208;emissive &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules in a crystal may meet the requirements of such waveguides. Here, we designed a bipyridyl&#8208;appended acrylonitrile&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule 1, which produced a 1D supramolecular polymer constructed through non&#8208;covalent bonding between a lone pair in 1 and a &#963;&#8208;hole in 1,4&#8208;diiodo&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene 2. The 1D copolymer of 1 and 2 is aligned horizontally with the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) crystal surface because of the angle&#8208;controlled supramolecular synthons. As a result of control over the non&#8208;covalent bonding direction, anisotropic photoluminescence and photon transport (optical waveguiding) characteristics are realized by orienting the transition dipole moment horizontally with respect to the 2D surface. Compared with the loss coefficient &#945;L =52dBcm&#8208;1 for the long&#8208;axis direction of the 2D platelet cocrystal, a very large difference of &#945;S =2111dBcm&#8208;1 is present in the crystal short&#8208;axis direction. The anisotropic waveguiding ability, &#945;L/&#945;S, is estimated to be 41, which is more than an order of magnitude greater than previously reported 2D platelet crystal waveguides. This supramolecular synthon provides an approach to designing anisotropic photon transporters and highly regulated optical logic circuits.</dc:description>

         <title>Geometry&#8208;Independent Ultrafast Energy Transfer in Bioinspired Arrays Containing Electronically Coupled BODIPY Dimers&#160;as Energy Donors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In photosynthetic light&#8208;harvesting complexes, strong interaction between chromophores enables efficient absorption of solar radiation and has been suggested to enable ultrafast energy funneling to the reaction center. To examine whether similar effects can be realized in synthetic systems, and to determine the mechanisms of energy transfer, we synthesized and characterized a series of bioinspired arrays containing strongly&#8208;coupled BODIPY dimer as energy donors and chlorin derivatives as energy acceptors. The BODIPY dimer feature broad absorption in the range of 500 &#8211; 600 nm, complementing the chlorin absorption to provide absorption across the entire visible spectrum. Ultrafast (~10 ps) energy transfer was observed from photoexcited BODIPY dyads to chlorin subunits. Surprisingly, the energy&#8208;transfer rate is nearly independent of the position where the BODIPY dimer is attached to the chlorin and of the type of connecting linker. In addition, the energy&#8208;transfer rate from BODIPY dimers to chlorin is slower than the corresponding rate in arrays containing BODIPY monomers. The lower rate, corresponding to less efficient through&#8208;bond transfer, is most likely due to weaker electronic coupling between the ground state of the chlorin acceptor and the delocalized electronic state of the BODIPY dimer, compared to the localized state of a BODIPY monomer.</dc:description>

         <title>Regime Switch in the Dual&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Alkyl Silicates with Aryl Bromides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metallaphotoredox catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of an arylbromide (Ar&#8208;Br) with an alkyl bis&#8208;catecholato silicate (R&#8208;Si&#8854;) has been analyzed in depth using a continuum of analytical techniques (EPR, fluorine NMR, electrochemistry, photophysics) and modeling (micro&#8208;kinetics and DFT calculations). These studies converged on the impact of four control parameters consisting in the initial concentrations of the iridium photocatalyst ([Ir]0), nickel precatalyst ([Ni]0) and silicate ([R&#8208;Si&#8854;]0) as well as light intensity I0 for an efficient reaction between Ar&#8208;Br and R&#8208;Si&#8854;. More precisely, two regimes were found to be possibly at play. The first one relies on an equimolar consumption of Ar&#8208;Br with R&#8208;Si&#8854; smoothly leading to Ar&#8208;R, with no side&#8208;product from R&#8208;Si&#8854; and a second one in which R&#8208;Si&#8854; is simultaneously coupled to Ar&#8208;Br and degraded to R&#8208;H. This integrative approach could serve as a case study for the investigation of other metallaphotoredox catalysis manifolds of synthetic significance.</dc:description>

         <title>Donor&#8208;acceptor activation of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activation and functionalization of carbon dioxide entails great interest related to its abundance, low toxicity and associated environmental problems. However, the inertness of CO2 has posed a challenge towards its efficient conversion to added&#8208;value products. In this review we discuss one of the strategies that have been widely used to capture and activate carbon dioxide, namely the use of donor&#8208;acceptor interactions by partnering a Lewis acidic and a Lewis basic fragment. This type of CO2 activation resembles that found in metalloenzymes, whose outstanding performance in catalytically transforming carbon dioxide encourages further bioinspired research. We have divided this review into three general sections based on the nature of the active sites: metal&#8208;free examples (mainly formed by frustrated Lewis pairs), main group&#8208;transition metal combinations, and transition metal heterobimetallic complexes. Overall, we discuss one hundred compounds that cooperatively activate carbon dioxide by donor&#8208;acceptor interactions, revealing a wide range of structural motifs.</dc:description>

Overall, we discuss one hundred compounds that cooperatively activate carbon dioxide by donor-acceptor interactions, revealing a wide range of structural motifs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Hetero&#8208;Pnictogen Diazonium Analogs Stabilized by Transition Metal Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactivity of the mixed dipnictogen complexes [{CpMo(CO)2}2(&#956;,&#951;2:2&#8208;PE)] (E&#160;=&#160;P,&#160;As,&#160;Sb) towards different group 14 electrophiles is reported. The resulting library of cationic compounds [{CpMo(CO)2}2(&#956;,&#951;2:2&#8208;EPR)]+ (R = Mes (2,4,6&#8208;C6H2Me3), CH3, CPh3, SnMe3) represents formally inorganic diazonium homologs which are stabilized by transition metal units. Modifying the steric and electronic properties of the electrophile drastically impacts the respective P&#8208;R bond lengths and is accompanied by increasing (SnMe3&gt;CPh3&gt;CH3) the dynamic behavior in solution. In contrast to the well&#8208;studied organic analogs, the prepared compounds are stable at room temperature. The subsequent reaction of the model substrate [{CpMo(CO)2}2(&#181;,&#951;2:2&#8208;P2Me)][OTf] ([OTf]&#8208; = [CF3SO3]&#8208;) with different N&#8209;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) leads to an addition at the unsubstituted P atom which is also predicted by computational methods. NMR spectroscopy confirms the formation of two isomers sync/gauche&#8208;[{CpMo(CO)2}(&#956;,&#951;2:1&#8208;P(NHC)PMe){CpMo(CO)2}][OTf]. X&#8208;ray crystallographic characterization and additional DFT calculations shed light on the spatial arrangement as well as on the possible formation pathways of the isomers.</dc:description>

         <title>Formal Synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Salvinorin A via Gold(I) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A formal synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Salvinorin A, a neo clerodane diterpenoid natural product and &#956;&#8208;opioid receptor agonist, is being reported utilizing a double application of gold(I) methodology as a Lewis acid and a photoredox catalyst.







Abstract
The formal synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;salvinorin A is presented. Our approach utilizes two distinct gold(I) catalytic processes. The combination of a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed reaction with an intermolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction followed by a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed photoredox reaction generated in eight steps the framework of the natural product with high diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Squaramide&#8208;Based Heteroditopic [2]Rotaxanes for Sodium Halide Ion&#8208;Pair Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rotaxane! Utilizing the Lewis basic carbonyl moieties of the squaramide motif, a series of squaramide&#8208;containing heteroditopic [2]rotaxanes are synthesized via sodium&#8208;cation templation. 1H&#8197;NMR binding studies reveal the bromide and iodide recognition capabilities of these heteroditopic receptors are significantly enhanced by up to ca. 20&#8208;fold in the presence of co&#8208;bound sodium cations, highlighting the unique ambidentate ion&#8208;pair binding nature of squaramides.







Abstract
A series of squaramide&#8208;based heteroditopic [2]rotaxanes consisting of isophthalamide macrocycle and squaramide axle components are synthesized using an alkali metal cation template&#8208;directed stoppering methodology. This work highlights the unprecedented sodium cation template coordination of the Lewis basic squaramide carbonyls for interlocked structure synthesis. Extensive quantitative 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopic anion and ion&#8208;pair recognition studies reveal the [2]rotaxane hosts are capable of cooperative sodium halide ion&#8208;pair mechanical bond axle&#8208;macrocycle component recognition, eliciting up to 20&#8208;fold enhancements in binding strengths for bromide and iodide, wherein the Lewis basic carbonyls and Lewis acidic NH hydrogen bond donors of the squaramide axle motif operate as cation and anion receptive sites simultaneously in an ambidentate fashion. Notably, varying the length and nature of the polyether cation binding unit of the macrocycle component dramatically influences the ion&#8208;pair binding affinities of the [2]rotaxanes, even overcoming direct contact NaCl ion&#8208;pair binding modes in polar organic solvents. Furthermore, the cooperative ion&#8208;pair binding properties of the squaramide&#8208;based heteroditopic [2]rotaxanes are exploited to successfully extract solid sodium halide salts into organic media.

2,2&#8217;&#8208;Biquinoline&#8208;based electroauxiliaries have successfully been developed as suitable reagents for the site&#8208;selective generation of alkyl radicals. Primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl radicals could be generated and several free radical reactions could be studied. The platform has the advantage of recyclability, which makes these alkyl radical precursors superior compared to previous N&#8208;heterocyclic electroauxiliaries.







Abstract
Alkyl radical precursors are essential for a wide variety of photocatalytic and 3d&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C bond forming reactions. Neutral organic heterocycles as electroauxiliaries such as 4&#8208;alkyl Hantzsch esters have become reliable tools for alkyl radical formation. Here we show that 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biquinoline&#8208;derived alkyl&#8208;substituted dihydroquinolines act as competent radical precursors with the ability to form primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl radicals. Hydroalkylation of benzalmalononitriles and N&#8208;Boc protected diazenes has been achieved through copper catalysis under mild conditions of 50&#8201;&#176;C with good to very good yields of up to 85&#8201;%. Furthermore, the dihydroquinolines&#8217; reactivity towards a denitrative alkylation of nitroolefins such as &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene was discovered. Most importantly, the released biquinoline can be recycled, which greatly improves the overall atom&#8208;economy of these alkyl radical precursors in comparison to previous N&#8208;heterocyclic electroauxiliaries.

         <title>Mono&#8208; and Difluorinated Saturated Heterocyclic Amines for Drug Discovery: Systematic Study of Their Physicochemical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mono&#8208; and difluorination of azetidine, pyrrolidine, and piperidine reduces basicity (pKa) and modulates lipophilicity (LogP) while retaining metabolic stability (CLint) in nearly all cases. Analysis of the obtained physicochemical data provides a rationale for fine&#8208;tuning the compounds&#8217; properties during drug optimization.







Abstract
A comprehensive study of physicochemical properties (pKa, LogP, and intrinsic microsomal clearance) within the series of mono&#8208; and difluorinated azetidine, pyrrolidine, and piperidine derivatives was performed. While the number of fluorine atoms and their distance to the protonation center were the major factors defining the compound's basicity, both pKa and LogP values were affected considerably by the conformational preferences of the corresponding derivatives. For example, features of &#8220;Janus face&#8221; (facially polarized) cyclic compounds (i.&#8201;e., unusually high hydrophilicity) were identified for cis&#8208;3,5&#8208;difluoropiperidine, preferring a diaxial conformation. Intrinsic microsomal clearance measurements demonstrated high metabolic stability of the compounds studied (with a single exception of the 3,3&#8208;difluoroazetidine derivative). According to pKa &#8211; LogP plots, the title compounds provide a valuable extension of the fluorine&#8208;containing (e.&#8201;g., fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted) saturated heterocyclic amine series as building blocks for rational optimization studies in early drug discovery.

         <title>Catalysis by KDM6 Histone Demethylases &#8211; A Synergy between the Non&#8208;Heme Iron(II) Center, Second Coordination Sphere, and Long&#8208;Range Interactions</title>

The study of the effects of SCS and LR residues at each intermediate level of the demethylation mechanism in the catalysis of KDM6 enzymes using QM/MM and MD simulations.







Abstract
KDM6A (UTX) and KDM6B (JMJD3) are human non&#8208;heme Fe(II) and 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) dependent JmjC oxygenases that catalyze the demethylation of trimethylated lysine 27 in the N&#8208;terminal tail of histone&#8197;H3, a post&#8208;translational modification that regulates transcription. A Combined Quantum Mechanics/ Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) study on the catalytic mechanism of KDM6A/B reveals that the transition state for the rate&#8208;limiting hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reaction in KDM6A catalysis is stabilized by polar (Asn217) and aromatic (Trp369)/non&#8208;polar (Pro274) residues in contrast to KDM4, KDM6B and KDM7 demethylases where charged residues (Glu, Arg, Asp) are involved. KDM6A employs both &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;electron transfer pathways for HAT, whereas KDM6B employs the &#963;&#8208;electron pathway. Differences in hydrogen bonding of the Fe&#8208;chelating Glu252(KDM6B) contribute to the lower energy barriers in KDM6B vs. KDM6A. The study reveals a dependence of the activation barrier of the rebound hydroxylation on the Fe&#8722;O&#8722;C angle in the transition state of KDM6A. Anti&#8208;correlation of the Zn&#8208;binding domain with the active site residues is a key factor distinguishing KDM6A/B from KDM7/4s. The results reveal the importance of communication between the Fe center, second coordination sphere, and long&#8208;range interactions in catalysis by KDMs and, by implication, other 2OG oxygenases.

         <title>Intramolecular Palladium Catalyst Transfer on Benzoheterodiazoles as Acceptor Monomers and Discovery of Catalyst Transfer Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular catalyst transfer takes place on dibromobenzotriazole, but not on dibromobenzothiadiazole in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reaction and polycondensation reaction with tBu3PPd precatalyst. Furthermore, the addition of benzothiadiazole interfered with catalyst transfer in the coupling reaction of dibromophenylene with phenylboronic acid ester, in which the catalyst transfer occurs in the absence of any additive.







Abstract
Intramolecular catalyst transfer on benzoheterodiazoles was investigated in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reactions and polymerization reactions with tBu3PPd precatalyst. In the coupling reactions of dibromobenzotriazole, dibromobenzoxazole, and dibromobenzothiadiazole with pinacol phenylboronate, the product ratios of monosubstituted product to disubstituted product were 0/100, 27/73, and 89/11, respectively, indicating that the Pd catalyst undergoes intramolecular catalyst transfer on dibromobenzotriazole, whereas intermolecular transfer occurs in part in the case of dibromobenzoxazole and is predominant for dibromobenzothiadiazole. The polycondensation of 1.3&#8197;equivalents of dibromobenzotriazole with 1.0&#8197;equivalent of para&#8208; and meta&#8208;phenylenediboronates afforded high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymer and cyclic polymer, respectively. In the case of dibromobenzoxazole, however, para&#8208; and meta&#8208;phenylenediboronates afforded moderate&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymer with bromine at both ends and cyclic polymer, respectively. In the case of dibromobenzothiadiazole, they afforded low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers with bromine at both ends. Addition of benzothiadiazole derivatives interfered with catalyst transfer in the coupling reactions.

         <title>Unlocking The Role of Guanidinium Salts in Interface Engineering for Boosted Performance of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfacial passivation of Guanidinium salts for inverted perovskite solar cells was systematically investigated. With the optimal benefit by reduced defects, the efficiency of 19.95&#8201;% is achieved for GuABr&#8208;modified solar cells with superior stability, which maintains 90&#8201;% of its original efficiency after 1600&#8197;h under a relative humidity of 35&#8201;%&#8211;55&#8201;% for unencapsulated devices.







Abstract
NiOx&#8208;based inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted growing attention due to their low cost and large&#8208;scale application potential. However, the efficiency and stability of inverted planar heterojunction PSCs is still unsatisfactory owing to insufficient charge&#8208;extraction caused by undesirable interfacial contact between perovskite and NiOx hole transport layers (HTLs). Herein an interfacial passivation strategy with guanidinium salts (guanidinium thiocyanate (GuASCN), guanidine hydrobromide (GuABr), guanidine hydriodate (GuAI)) as passivator is employed to solve this problem. We systematically study the effect of various guanidinium salts on the crystallinity, morphology, and photophysical properties of perovskite films. Guanidine salt as interfacial passivator can decrease interface resistance, reduce carrier non&#8208;radiative recombination, and boost carrier extraction. Notably, the GuABr&#8208;treated unencapsulated devices can still maintain more than 90&#8201;% of their initial PCE after aging for 1600&#8197;h at 16&#8211;25&#8201;&#176;C and 35&#8201;%&#8211;50&#8201;% relative humidity in ambient conditions. This work reveals the significance of counterions in improving the photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs.

With the optimal benefit by reduced defects, the efficiency of 19.95&#8201;% is achieved for GuABr-modified solar cells with superior stability, which maintains 90&#8201;% of its original efficiency after 1600&#8197;h under a relative humidity of 35&#8201;%&#8211;55&#8201;% for unencapsulated devices.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NiOx-based inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted growing attention due to their low cost and large-scale application potential. However, the efficiency and stability of inverted planar heterojunction PSCs is still unsatisfactory owing to insufficient charge-extraction caused by undesirable interfacial contact between perovskite and NiOx hole transport layers (HTLs). Herein an interfacial passivation strategy with guanidinium salts (guanidinium thiocyanate (GuASCN), guanidine hydrobromide (GuABr), guanidine hydriodate (GuAI)) as passivator is employed to solve this problem. We systematically study the effect of various guanidinium salts on the crystallinity, morphology, and photophysical properties of perovskite films. Guanidine salt as interfacial passivator can decrease interface resistance, reduce carrier non-radiative recombination, and boost carrier extraction. Notably, the GuABr-treated unencapsulated devices can still maintain more than 90&#8201;% of their initial PCE after aging for 1600&#8197;h at 16&#8211;25&#8201;&#176;C and 35&#8201;%&#8211;50&#8201;% relative humidity in ambient conditions. This work reveals the significance of counterions in improving the photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Superionic Conductivity in Sodium Zirconium Chloride&#8208;Based Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New superionic conductors based on polyanion&#8208;added chloride&#8208;based materials are reported. Na0.67Zr(SO4)0.33Cl4 showed a high ionic conductivity of 1.6&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicated that the highly conducting materials are mainly a mixture of an amorphous phase and Na2ZrCl6. The sodium ionic conductivity might be dominated by the electronegativity of the central atom of the polyanion.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries are attracting intensive attention, and chloride&#8208;based solid electrolytes are promising candidates for use in such batteries because of their high chemical stability and low Young's modulus. Here, we report new superionic conductors based on polyanion&#8208;added chloride&#8208;based materials. Na0.67Zr(SO4)0.33Cl4 showed a high ionic conductivity of 1.6&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicated that the highly conducting materials are mainly a mixture of an amorphous phase and Na2ZrCl6. The conductivity might be dominated by the electronegativity of the central atom of the polyanion. Electrochemical measurements reveal that Na0.67Zr(SO4)0.33Cl4 is a sodium ionic conductor and is suitable for use as a solid electrolyte in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries.

         <title>Promoting Amination of Furfural to Furfurylamine by Metal&#8208;Support Interactions on Pd/MoO3&#8722;x Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;valence Mo species acts as Lewis acid sites to activate aldehyde groups and deliver strong metal&#8208;support interactions to enable metallic Pd centers toward the boosted amination of furfural with a high yield of 84&#8201;%.







Abstract
The reductive amination of carbonyl compounds is one of the most straightforward protocols to construct C&#8722;N bonds, but highly desires active and selective catalysts. Herein, Pd/MoO3&#8722;x catalysts are proposed for furfural amination, in which the interactions between Pd nanoparticles and MoO3&#8722;x supports can be easily ameliorated by varying the preparation temperature toward efficient catalytic turnover. Thanks to the synergistic cooperation of MoV&#8208;rich MoO3&#8722;x and highly dispersed Pd, the optimal catalysts afford the high yield of furfurylamine (84&#8201;%) at 80&#8201;&#176;C. Thereinto, MoV species not only acts as the acidic promoter to facilitate the activation of carbonyl groups, but also interacts with Pd nanoparticles to promote the subsequent hydrogenolysis of Schiff base N&#8208;furfurylidenefurfurylamine and its germinal diamine. The good efficiency of Pd/MoO3&#8722;x within a broad substrate scope further highlights the key contribution of metal&#8208;support interactions to the refinery of biomass feedstocks.

@A_Le_Goff Optimising Electrical Interfacing between the Trimeric Copper Nitrite Reductase and Carbon Nanotubes (Le Goff**et al.).







Abstract
The immobilization of copper&#8208;containing nitrite reductase (NiR) from Alcaligenes faecalis on functionalised multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) electrodes is reported. It is demonstrated that this immobilization is mainly driven by hydrophobic interactions, promoted by the modification of MWCNTs with adamantyl groups. Direct electrochemistry shows high bioelectrochemical reduction of nitrite at the redox potential of NiR with high current density of 1.41&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the desymmetrization of the trimer upon immobilization induces an independent electrocatalytic behavior for each of the three enzyme subunits, corroborated by an electron&#8208;tunneling distance dependence.

Abstract
1,3&#8208;Disubstituted N&#8208;aryl&#8208;2H&#8208;isoindoles have been synthesized by a cascade reaction of divinyl ethers, which are derived from easily available 4&#8208;bromoisocoumarins, with substituted anilines in HFIP. This cascade reaction consists of a ring&#8208;opening step through addition&#8208;elimination mechanism and the following 5&#8208;exo&#8208;tet type ring&#8208;closing step via the intramolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction. Thus obtained 2H&#8208;isoindoles have been derivatized to high&#8208;order nitrogen&#8208;containing polycycles including less accessible benzo[a]ullazines.

         <title>Insight into the Structural Ambiguity of Actinide(IV) Oxalate Sheet Structures: A Case for Alternate Coordination Geometries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Old, limited data in the nuclear field is relied upon, but often requires revisiting for clarity. Like cracked glasses, flaws in old data can lead to missing information. Structural assumptions about PuIV oxalate hexahydrate have existed for decades, but only now has the structure been reported. These data have led to the identification of previously unreported coordination of water and changing oxalate positions across the isostructural AnIV series. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;K. Sockwell, A.&#8197;E. Hixon and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301164).

         <title>Zero&#8208;Dimensional Sn&#8208;Based Enantiomeric Phase Transition Materials with High&#8208;Tc and Dielectric Switching</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of chirality and phase transition materials has broad application prospects. Therefore, based on the quasi&#8208;spherical theory and the thought strategy of introducing chirality, we have successfully synthesized a pair of chiral enantiomeric ligand R/S&#8208;triethyl (2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;propyl) ammonium iodide, which can be combined with tin hexachloride anion to obtain a pair of new organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid enantiomeric high&#8208;temperature plastic phase transition materials: R/S&#8208;[CH3CH(OH)CH2N(CH2CH3)3]2SnCl6 (1&#8208;R/1&#8208;S), which has a high temperature phase transition of Tc=384 K, crystallized in P21 chiral space group at room temperature, and has obvious CD signal. In addition, compound 1&#8208;R and 1&#8208;S also has good low&#8208;loss dielectric switch and broadband gap. This work is conducive to the research of chiral high&#8208;temperature reversible plastic phase transition materials, and promotes the development of multi&#8208;functional phase transition materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Modeling Reactivity of Nitrite and Nitrous Acid at a Phenolate Bridged Dizinc(II) Site: Insights into NO Signaling at Zinc</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although nitrite&#8208;to&#8208;NO transformation at various transition metals including Fe and Cu are relatively well explored, examples of such a reaction at the redox&#8208;inactive zinc(II) site are limited. The present report aims to gain insights into the reactivity of nitrite anion, nitrous acid (HONO), and organonitrite (RONO) at a dizinc(II) site. A phenolate&#8208;bridged dizinc(II)&#8208;aqua complex [LHZnII(OH2)]2(ClO4)2&#160;(1H&#8208;Aq, where&#160;LH&#160;= tridentate N,N,O&#8208;donor monoanionic ligand) is illustrated to react with&#160;tBuONO to provide a metastable arene&#8208;nitrosonium charge&#8208;transfer complex&#160;2H. UV&#8208;vis, FTIR, multinuclear NMR, and elemental analyses suggests the presence of a&#160;2:1&#160;arene&#8208;nitrosonium&#160;moiety. Furthermore, the reactivity of a structurally characterized zinc(II)&#8208;nitrite complex [LHZnII(ONO)]2&#160;(1H&#8208;ONO) with a proton&#8208;source demonstrates HONO reactivity at the dizinc(II) site. Reactivity of both RONO&#160;(R = alkyl/H)&#160;at the phenolate&#8208;bridged dizinc(II) site provides NO+&#160;charge&#8208;transfer complex&#160;2H. Subsequently, the reactions of&#160;2H&#160;with exogenous reductants (such as ferrocene, thiol, phenol, and catechol) have been illustrated to generate NO. In addition, NO yielding reactivity of [LHZnII(ONO)]2&#160;(1H&#8208;ONO) in the presence of above&#8208;mentioned reductants have been&#160;compared with the reactions of complex&#160;2H. Thus, this report sheds light on the transformations of&#160;NO2&#8211;/RONO (R = alkyl/H) toNO/NO+&#160;at the redox&#8208;inactive zinc(II) coordination motif.</dc:description>

         <title>Reexamining the Emergence and Stability of the Square Cylinder Phase in Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transition from the square cylinder phase to the rectangular cylinder phase is a second&#8208;order transition that accompanies the transition of the free&#8208;energy landscape from one minimum to two minima. The prolate contour lines of the free&#8208;energy landscape indicate the weak stability of the square phase in the B1A1B2A2B3 copolymer.







Abstract
Recently, a few AB&#8208;type multiblock copolymers have been successfully designed to form stable square cylinder phase based on self&#8208;consistent field theory (SCFT) calculations. The previous works only identify the stability region of the square phase but not analyzing its stability, which is closely related to the free&#8208;energy landscape. In this work, we have reexamined the stability of the square phase in 
 linear pentablock and 
 star triblock copolymers by drawing the free&#8208;energy landscape with respect to the two dimensions of a rectangular unit cell. Our results demonstrate that the square phase continuously transfers to the rectangular phase as the degree of packing frustration is gradually released. Moreover, the prolate contour lines of the free&#8208;energy landscape indicate the weak stability of the square phase in the 
 copolymer. In contrast, the stability of the square phase is notably improved in the 
 copolymer due to its enhanced concentration of bridging configurations. Our work sheds light on the understanding of the stability of the square cylinder phase in block copolymers. Accordingly, we propose some possible strategies for further designing new AB&#8208;type block copolymer systems to obtain more stable square phase.

         <title>Polymer Nanoantidotes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer nanoantidotes implement the detoxification process through three different patterns, physical interaction, chemical bonding, and biomimetic clearance, and their significant efficacy speculates on the opportunities for clinical application.







Abstract
Intoxication is one of the most common causes of accidental death globally. Although some antidotes capable of neutralizing the toxicity of certain xenobiotics have become well established, the current reality is that clinicians primarily rely on nonspecific extracorporeal techniques to remove toxins. Nano&#8208;intervention strategies in which nanoantidotes neutralize toxicity in&#8197;situ via physical interaction, chemical bonding, or biomimetic clearance have begun to show clinical potential. However, most nanoantidotes remain in the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept stage, and the difficulty of constructing clinical relevance models and the unclear pharmacokinetics of nanoantidotes hinder their translation to clinic. This Concept reviews the detoxification mechanisms of polymer nanoantidotes and predicts the opportunities and challenges associated with their clinical application.

         <title>Reactivity Differences of Trigonal Pyramidal Nonheme Iron(IV)&#8208;Oxo and Iron(III)&#8208;Oxo Complexes: Experiment and Theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combined experimental and computational studies show iron(III)&#8208;oxo complexes can abstract hydrogen atoms from toluene efficiently, but thermochemically fail to do OH rebound and as such tolyl radicals are released and react separately. As a consequence iron(IV)&#8208;oxo and iron(III)&#8208;oxo generate different products in a reaction with toluene.







Abstract
High&#8208;valent metal&#8208;oxo species play critical roles in enzymatic catalysis yet their properties are still poorly understood. In this work we report a combined experimental and computational study into biomimetic iron(IV)&#8208;oxo and iron(III)&#8208;oxo complexes with tight second&#8208;coordination sphere environments that restrict substrate access. The work shows that the second&#8208;coordination sphere slows the hydrogen atom abstraction step from toluene dramatically and the kinetics is zeroth order in substrate. However, the iron(II)&#8208;hydroxo that is formed has a low reduction potential and hence cannot do OH rebound favorably. The tolyl radical in solution then reacts further with alternative reaction partners. By contrast, the iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species reacts predominantly through OH rebound to form alcohol products. Our studies show that the oxidation state of the metal influences reactivities and selectivities with substrate dramatically and that enzymes will likely need an iron(IV) center to catalyze C&#8722;H hydroxylation reactions.

         <title>Beyond the Limits of Atropochirality: Design of Highly Conformationally Restrained Biaryls with Bridgehead Phosphine Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atropochirality in 2,2&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted biaryls is a long&#8208;standing quest, and only the bulkiest substituents slow down their rotation. However, a new and rigid bicyclic scaffold has recently been developed. This scaffold has successfully pushed the limits of atropochirality even with substituents as small as fluorine atom. By using variable temperature NMR spectroscopy and DFT computational studies, insights about the mechanism of isomerisation were gained.







Abstract
In the last three decades, reacting sterically congested ortho&#8208;substituted arenes to form atropochiral biaryls is an appealing venture and a challenging subject that has garnered significant attention. Therefore, there is interest in developing methods to prepare these compounds. In this study, an efficient approach to produce a new class 2,2&#8217; disubstituted biaryls bridgehead phosphine oxides with an unusual topology and exceptional conformational stability is presented. Our methodology demonstrates that depending on the substitution pattern on the aryl moieties, the methanophosphocine backbone could be rigid enough to observe a double atropochirality, resulting in an under covered class of molecules. Notably, our studies revealed that replacing only one hydrogen at the ortho position by a fluorine atom led to sufficiently restricted rotation at temperatures below 80&#8201;&#176;C, extending &#8220;far away&#8221; the limits of atropostability. Finally, our investigations, which employed variable&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations, yielded unique insights into the isomerisation mechanism, indicating that the two biaryl motifs are fully independent in spite of their proximity.

Label free detection of protein&#8208;small molecule interactions mediated by the helical peptide nanotubes using impedance spectroscopy is reported. This method can be used to detect interactions of protein and small molecules at very low concentrations.







Abstract
Development of miniaturized lab&#8208;on&#8208;chip devices for the detection of rapid and specific small molecule&#8208;protein binding interactions at very low concentrations holds significant importance in drug discovery and biomedical applications. Here, the label&#8208;free detection of small molecule&#8208;protein interactions is reported on the surface functionalizable nanotubes of &#945;,&#947;&#8208;hybrid peptide helical foldamers using nanoscale capacitance and impedance spectroscopy. The 12&#8208;helix conformation of the &#945;,&#947;&#8208;hybrid peptide observed in the single crystals, self&#8208;assembled into nanotubes in an aqueous environment with exposed cysteine thiols for small molecule conjugation. The binding of streptavidin to the covalently linked biotin on the surface of nanotubes was detected at the picomolar concentrations. No change in the capacitance and impedance were observed in the absence of either immobilized biotin or protein streptavidin. The functionalizable hybrid peptide nanotubes reported here pave the way for the label&#8208;free detection of various small molecule protein interactions at very low concentrations.

         <title>Micelle&#8208;Mediated Sonogashira Coupling for DNA&#8208;Encoded Library Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A micelle&#8208;mediated Sonogashira reaction between on&#8208;DNA (hetero)aryl iodides or bromides and (hetero)aryl or aliphatic terminal alkynes. The methodology shows broad substrate scope in terms of both coupling partners and we demonstrate that the methodology is fully compatible with library synthesis protocols and DNA encoded and decoding. This methodology will enable the synthesis of alkynyl(hetero)biaryls or it could be used for subsequent derivatization to alternative products, such as the corresponding alkane or heterocycles.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries (DELs) are becoming widely established as a hit identification strategy for drug discovery campaigns. Their successful application relies on the availability and efficiency of the reactions that can be carried out on DNA. These reactions should proceed with high conversion to the desired product and have a broad substrate scope to synthesise chemically diverse and drug&#8208;like DELs. The Sonogashira coupling provides a unique means of coupling an sp&#8208;hybridized carbon centre to an aryl halide and methods to achieve this reaction on DNA are highly desirable. We report the application of our micellar technology for on&#8208;DNA chemistry to the Sonogashira reaction. This method gives highly efficient conversions for the coupling of (hetero)aromatic and aliphatic alkynes to (hetero)aryl iodides and bromides allowing the preparation of highly diverse DELs.

         <title>Rapid Chemical Synthesis of Serine Protease Inhibitor Kazal&#8208;type 13 (SPINK13) Glycoform by a Combined Method with Glycan Insertion Strategy and Fast&#8208;Flow Fmoc SPPS

Glycosylated asparagine thioacid was designed to chemoselectively be inserted between two peptide segments at the sterically bulky amino acids sequence Pro&#8208;Asn(N&#8208;glycan)&#8208;Val junction by two coupling reactions which consist of diacyl disulfide coupling (DDC) and thioacid capture ligation (TCL). The both N and C terminus peptides were prepared by a fast&#8208;flow Fmoc SPPS method. A combined method with DDC, TCL and a fast&#8208;flow Fmoc SPPS method successfully shortened the route of glycoprotein synthesis.







Abstract
Serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 13 (SPINK13) is a secreted protein that has been recently studied as a therapeutic drug and an interesting biomarker for cancer cells. Although SPINK13 has a consensus sequence (Pro&#8208;Asn&#8208;Val&#8208;Thr) for N&#8208;glycosylation, the existence of N&#8208;glycosylation and its functions are still unclear. In addition to this, the preparation of glycosylated SPINK 13 has not been examined by both the cell expression method and chemical synthesis. Herein we report the chemical synthesis of the scarce N&#8208;glycosylated form of SPINK13 by a rapid synthetic method combined with the chemical glycan insertion strategy and a fast&#8208;flow SPPS method. Glycosylated asparagine thioacid was designed to chemoselectively be inserted between two peptide segments where is the sterically bulky Pro&#8208;Asn(N&#8208;glycan)&#8208;Val junction by two coupling reactions which consist of diacyl disulfide coupling (DDC) and thioacid capture ligation (TCL). This insertion strategy successfully afforded the full&#8208;length polypeptide of SPINK13 within two steps from glycosylated asparagine thioacid. Because the two peptides used for this synthesis were prepared by a fast&#8208;flow SPPS, the total synthetic time of glycoprotein was considerably shortened. This synthetic concept enables us to repetitively synthesize a target glycoprotein easily. Folding experiments afforded well&#8208;folded structure confirmed by CD and disulfide bond map. Invasion assays of glycosylated SPINK13 and non&#8208;glycosylated SPINK13 with pancreatic cancer cells showed that non&#8208;glycosylated SPINK&#8208;13 was more potent than that of glycosylated SPINK13.

         <title>Highly Chemoselective Zn+2&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrosilylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new dicationic Zn&#8208;based complex was synthesized and found to be a highly selective catalyst for the hydrosilylation of alkynes. Remarkably, this complex could selectively catalyze the hydrosilylation of alkynes even in the presence of alkenes.







Abstract
Hydrosilylation of C=C double and C&#8801;C triple bonds is one of the most widely used processes in organosilicon chemistry, mostly catalyzed by Pt&#8208;based complexes. Herein, the synthesis of a dicationic Zn+2&#8208;based complex with a tripodal tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine (TPA) ligand is reported which was found to be a highly chemoselective catalyst for hydrosilylation reactions of alkynes. Mechanistic studies revealed that unlike typical Zn&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation reactions where the key step is the activation of the Si&#8722;H bond, this system catalyzes the hydrosilylation reaction through the activation of C&#8801;C triple bonds, which presumably is the reason for its high chemoselectivity. Remarkably, the hydrosilylation of alkynes could be performed in the presence of alkenes and other functional groups that remained intact in this reaction.

         <title>Isolation, Structural and Physical Characterization as well as Reactivity of Persistent Acenium Radical Cation Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first stable salts of unsubstituted radical cations of anthracene, tetracene and pentacene were isolated in the condensed phase by deelectronation of the respective neutral acenes. The radical cation salts were structurally, electrochemically and spectroscopically characterized (IR, Raman, UV&#8208;Vis, EPR).







Abstract
The unsubstituted acenium radical cations (ARCs) are extremely sensitive and were hitherto only studied in&#8197;situ, i.&#8201;e. in the gas phase, as dilute solutions in strong acids or by matrix isolation spectroscopy at about 10&#8197;K. In this study, room temperature stable ARC salts with the weakly coordinating anion [F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (ORF=&#8722;OC(CF3)3) supported by the weakly coordinating solvent 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene (TFB) were prepared and structurally, electrochemically and spectroscopically characterized. Reaction of the neutral acenes with Ag+[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; led, non&#8208;innocent,[54] to intermediate [Ag2(acene)2]2+ complexes, which decompose over time to Ag0 and the corresponding (impure) ARC salts. By contrast, direct deelectronation with the recently developed innocent[54] deelectronator radical cation salt [anthraceneHal]+&#8901;[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; led to phase&#8208;pure products [acene]+&#8901;[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (anthraceneHal=9,10&#8208;dichlorooctafluoroanthracene; acene=anthra&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, pentacene). For the first time, a homogenous set of spectroscopic data on analytically pure ARC salts was obtained. In addition, cyclovoltammetric measurements of the acenes connected the potentials in solution with those in the gas&#8208;phase. Hence, the data complement the existing isolated gas&#8208;phase, strong acid or matrix isolation studies. A first entry to follow&#8208;up chemistry of the acenium radical cations as ligand forming oxidizers was demonstrated by reaction with 
 Co2(CO)8 giving [Co(anthracene)(CO)2]+.

This study unveils the substrate promiscuity of acyltransferase LovD9, which turns to be very efficient by accepting vinyl and p&#8208;nitrophenyl derivatives as acyl donors for the obtaining of statin analogues.







Abstract
This study identifies new acyl donors for manufacturing statin analogues through the acylation of monacolin J acid by the laboratory evolved acyltransferase LovD9. Vinyl and p&#8208;nitrophenyl esters have emerged as alternate substrates for LovD9&#8208;catalyzed acylation. While vinyl esters can reach product yields as high as the ones obtained by &#945;&#8208;dimethyl butyryl&#8208;S&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;mercaptopropionate (DMB&#8208;SMMP), the thioester for which LovD9 was evolved, p&#8208;nitrophenyl esters display a reactivity even higher than DMB&#8208;SMMP for the first acylation step yet the acylation product yield is lower. The reaction mechanisms were elucidated through quantum mechanics (QM) calculations.

         <title>Cu2P7&#8208;CoP Heterostructure Nanosheets Enable High&#8208;Performance of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Electrooxidation</title>

Cu2P7&#8208;CoP heterostructure nanosheets were designed as the electrocatalyst for conversion of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural into 2, 5&#8208;furanedioic acid, achieving superior electrooxidation performance.







Abstract
Electrooxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfural (HMF) into 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylicacid (FDCA) has been regarded as a promising sustainable approach to achieve value&#8208;added chemicals. However, it is still impeded by the unsatisfactory performance of electrocatalysts. Here, Cu2P7&#8208;CoP heterostructure nanosheets were reported to enable powerful HMF electrooxidation. The Cu2P7&#8208;CoP heterostructure nanosheets were fabricated by microwave&#8208;assisted deep eutectic solvent (DES) approach, along with subsequent phosphiding. The Cu2P7&#8208;CoP heterostructure nanosheets enabled a superb 100&#8201;% HMF conversion at 1.43&#8197;V (vs. RHE) with 98.8&#8201;% FDCA yield and 98&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (FE), demonstrating its promising application in HMF electrooxidation. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, open&#8208;circuit potential (OCP) approach and density functional theory (DFT) calculation uncovered that the electron transfer and redistribution between Cu2P7 and CoP improved the adsorption capacity of HMF and modulated the catalytic performance. This study not only offered a powerful electrocatalyst for HMF electrooxidation, but also provided a conceptually new strategy for the heterostructure catalyst design.

         <title>Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based AIE Supramolecular Polymer Networks Exhibiting Various Fluorescence to Achieve Visible Surveillance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is significant to achieve visual surveillance of the formation process for supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs). A special AIEgen was introduced into SPNs constructed by host&#8211;guest recognition between pillar[5]arene and pyridine salt. With rising cross&#8208;linking degree, the fluorescence color changes from blue to green due to the gradual aggregated AIEgen, enabling the formation process becoming visually.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs) based on pillar[n]arene are widely studied and it is known that evolution from linear polymers to SPNs occurs as a progressive process, which is of importance to monitor the detailed morphology throughout the process. Yet, the current reports related to that distinction by employing fluorescence approach have realized confined success, it still remains a challenge to distinguish the various states visually. Herein, a fluorescent group of the pyrene benzohydrazonate&#8208;based (PBHZ&#8208;based) derivative is introduced into the pillar[5]arene based SPNs gained from host&#8211;guest recognition, enabling the visual monitoring during the formation of SPNs. The whole visual detection was based on the fluorescence color transition ranging from blue to green relying on the gradual aggregated PBHZ molecules upon the increasing cross&#8208;linking degree. Besides, the stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of this SPNs was confirmed that increasing the temperature or adding a reducing agent would reduce the cross&#8208;linking degree.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It is significant to achieve visual surveillance&lt;/b&gt; of the formation process for supramolecular polymer networks (&lt;b&gt;SPNs&lt;/b&gt;). A special AIEgen was introduced into &lt;b&gt;SPNs&lt;/b&gt; constructed by host&#8211;guest recognition between pillar[5]arene and pyridine salt. With rising cross-linking degree, the fluorescence color changes from blue to green due to the gradual aggregated AIEgen, enabling the formation process becoming visually.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs) based on pillar[n]arene are widely studied and it is known that evolution from linear polymers to SPNs occurs as a progressive process, which is of importance to monitor the detailed morphology throughout the process. Yet, the current reports related to that distinction by employing fluorescence approach have realized confined success, it still remains a challenge to distinguish the various states visually. Herein, a fluorescent group of the pyrene benzohydrazonate-based (PBHZ-based) derivative is introduced into the pillar[5]arene based SPNs gained from host&#8211;guest recognition, enabling the visual monitoring during the formation of SPNs. The whole visual detection was based on the fluorescence color transition ranging from blue to green relying on the gradual aggregated PBHZ molecules upon the increasing cross-linking degree. Besides, the stimuli-responsiveness of this SPNs was confirmed that increasing the temperature or adding a reducing agent would reduce the cross-linking degree.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Substituted meta[n]Cycloparaphenylenes: Synthesis, Photophysical Properties and Host&#8211;guest Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different sized cyano&#8208;meta[n]cycloparaphenylenes (CN&#8208;m[n]CPPs) have been prepared for investigation of their photophysical properties. Furthermore, CN&#8208;m[6]CPP served as key substrate to demonstrate the versatility of the nitrile functionality and therefore a general concept towards functionalized m[n]CPPs was developed. Additionally, CN&#8208;m[10]CPP was used to report the first association constant of a m[10]CPP with fullerene C60.







Abstract
Breaking the centrosymmetry of [n]cycloparaphenylenes ([n]CPPs) by one meta connection, leads to bright emission in the typically non&#8208;fluorescent smaller derivatives, conserving their size dependent emissive properties. Using the building block strategy for [n]CPPs, different nitrile substituted meta[n]CPPs (n=6, 8, 10) have been prepared. The nitrile substituent offers a convenient handle for functional group conversions (e.g., carboxylic acid, amide, aldehyde, as well as 1H&#8208;tetrazole). Besides the synthetic work, the photophysical properties of these novel m[n]CPP derivatives have been characterized. Additionally, the host&#8211;guest ability of cyano&#8208;m[10]CPP has been explored by studying its complexation with fullerene C60. These insights open new applications of meta[n]CPPs as fluorophore in synthetic organic chemistry, material sciences as well as biomedical research.

         <title>Selective Nsp2&#8208; and Csp2&#8208; Photografting of Au&#8208;Surface by Aryldiazonium Salts and Arylazo Sulfonates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>

Photografting of azosulfates Ar&#8722;N=NSO3Na on gold, leads to bonded organic films. Au&#8722;R or Au&#8722;N=N&#8722;R bonding results from a stepwise or concerted reaction respectively. Azosulfonates are shelf stable compounds which are much easier to handle with respect to the commonaryldiazonium salt.







Abstract
Arylazo sulfonates (Ar&#8722;N=N&#8722;SO3Na) have been found to undergo photografting on gold surface through both Au&#8722;Nsp2&#8722; and Au&#8722;Csp2&#8722; bond formation. The functionalized materials have been fully characterized by infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS), Raman, XPS, DFT calculations and UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectroscopy. These methods permit to evidence aromatic substituents (IRRAS), the Au&#8722;N=N signature (Raman and XPS spectroscopy), and the bond dissociation energy values of the two linkages (DFT calculation). The grafting proceeds through two competitive paths, namely a stepwise reaction involving an aryl radical (for the formation of the Au&#8722;Ar bonds) and a concerted reaction on the surface of gold (for Au&#8722;N=N&#8722;Ar bond formation). The occurrence of an aryl radical upon irradiation has been fully evidenced by EPR spectroscopy. Finally, E/Z photoisomerisation of the N=N bonds present on prepared few layer films has been observed by means of UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectroscopy.

         <title>Design of Cu&#8208;Substituted O3&#8208;Type NaFe0.5Mn0.5O2 Cathode Materials for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
The effect of different copper contents on the electrochemical performance of environmentally friendly CO/Ni&#8208;free O3&#8208;type Fe/Mn&#8208;based cathode is systematically investigated. The introduction of a high proportion of copper can simultaneously regulate both the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface and the bulk phase. Therefore, the obtained cathode material with an optimized component of NaCu0.20Fe0.30Mn0.50O2 achieves a significant improvement in electrochemical performance.







Abstract
O3&#8208;type Fe/Mn&#8208;based layered oxide cathode materials with abundant reserves have a promising prospect in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the electrochemical reversibility of most O3&#8208;type Fe/Mn&#8208;based oxide cathode materials is still not high enough. Herein, the effect of different Cu contents on the electrochemical properties of O3&#8208;NaFe0.50Mn0.50O2 materials is systematically investigated. The as&#8208;prepared NaFe0.30Mn0.50Cu0.20O2 cathode achieves the synergistic optimization of the interface and bulk phase. It shows superior electrochemical performance, with an initial discharge specific capacity of 114&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C, a capacity retention rate of 94&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C, and excellent chemical stability in air and water. In addition, the sodium ion full battery based on NaFe0.30Mn0.50Cu0.20O2 cathode and hard carbon anode has a capacity retention rate of 81&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles. This research provides a useful approach for the preparation of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance O3&#8208;type layered cathode materials.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalysts for the Selective 2&#8201;e&#8722; Oxygen Reduction Reaction: A Never&#8208;Ending Story?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>

The exohedral functionalization of carbon nanomaterials with tailored O&#8208;containing groups appears as the long&#8208;sought solution for putting an end to a highly controversial matter within the scientific community: shedding light on the puzzling structure/reactivity relationship in metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for the challenging 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrosynthesis via the 2e&#8722; Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) represents a highly challenging, environmentally friendly and cost&#8208;effective alternative to the current anthraquinone&#8208;based technology. Various lightweight element hetero&#8208;doped carbon nanostructures are promising and cheap metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for H2O2 synthesis, particularly those containing O&#8208;functionalities. The exact role of O&#8208;containing functional groups as electroactive sites for the process remains debated if not highly controversial. Herein, we have reported on the covalent exohedral functionalization of the outer surface of extra&#8208;pure multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with discrete O&#8208;functional groups as a unique approach to prepare selective electrocatalysts for the process. This kind of decoration has added fundamental tiles to the puzzling structure/reactivity relationship of O&#8208;containing carbon&#8208;based catalysts for ORR, clearing doubts on the controversial role of hydroxyl/phenol groups as key functionalities for the design of more performing 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalysts.

&lt;p&gt;The exohedral functionalization of carbon nanomaterials with tailored O-containing groups appears as the long-sought solution for putting an end to a highly controversial matter within the scientific community: shedding light on the puzzling structure/reactivity relationship in metal-free electrocatalysts for the challenging 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen reduction reaction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) electrosynthesis via the 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) represents a highly challenging, environmentally friendly and cost-effective alternative to the current anthraquinone-based technology. Various lightweight element hetero-doped carbon nanostructures are promising and cheap metal-free electrocatalysts for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis, particularly those containing O-functionalities. The exact role of O-containing functional groups as electroactive sites for the process remains debated if not highly controversial. Herein, we have reported on the covalent exohedral functionalization of the outer surface of extra-pure multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with discrete O-functional groups as a unique approach to prepare selective electrocatalysts for the process. This kind of decoration has added fundamental tiles to the puzzling structure/reactivity relationship of O-containing carbon-based catalysts for ORR, clearing doubts on the controversial role of hydroxyl/phenol groups as key functionalities for the design of more performing 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Structural isomers of thienoindolizines have been synthesized in a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step procedure starting from easily accessible gem&#8208;difluoroalkene functionalized bromothiophenes. The synthesis strategy consists of base mediated nucleophilic substitution followed by Pd catalyzed intramolecular cyclization.

Abstract
A series of thienoindolizine structural isomers have been synthesized in a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step procedure starting from easily accessible gem&#8208;difluoroalkene functionalized bromothiophenes. The developed method gives easy access to a range of thienoindolizine products containing thieno[3,2&#8208;g]&#8208;, thieno[3,4&#8208;g]&#8208; and thieno[2,3&#8208;g]indolizine core structures. The described synthesis strategy consists of a base mediated, transition metal free nucleophilic substitution of fluorine atoms by nitrogen containing heterocycles followed by a Pd catalyzed intramolecular cyclization. A series of 22 final product examples has been obtained with yields ranging from 29&#8201;% to 95&#8201;%. UV/Vis absorption, fluorescence spectroscopy, fluorescence lifetime measurements and cyclic voltammetry were carried out with selected final products to evaluate structural effects on photophysical and electrochemical properties. (TD)DFT and NICS calculations were performed to provide insight into the electronic properties of the four core molecular structures.

         <dc:description>
Synthesis of a 3D porous organic polymer starting from a simple 0D bistriflate precursor via in&#8197;situ CsF catalyzed formation of benzyne. This is the first demonstration of 3D polymer being prepared from a single and simple precursor. The resulting benzyne&#8208;derived porous organic polymer showed 544&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 surface area and IAST CO2/N2 selectivity of 65.4







Abstract
Porous organic polymers (POPs) have gained tremendous attention owing to their chemical tunability, stability and high surface areas. Whereas there are several examples of fully conjugated two&#8208;dimensional (2D) POPs, three&#8208;dimensional (3D) ones are rather challenging to realize in the absence of structural templates. Herein, we report the base&#8208;catalyzed direct synthesis of a fully conjugated 3D POPs, named benzyne&#8208;derived polymers (BDPs), containing biphenylene and tetraphenylene moieties starting from a simple bisbenzyne precursor, which undergoes [2+2] and [2+2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions to form BDPs primarily composed of biphenylene and tetraphenylene moieties. The resulting polymers exhibited ultramicroporous structures with surface areas up to 544&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and very high CO2/N2 selectivities.

         <title>Pushing the Boundary of Covalency in Lanthanoid&#8208;Tellurium Bonds: Insights from the Synthesis, Molecular and Electronic Structures of Low&#8208;Coordinate, Monomeric Europium(II) and Ytterbium(II) Tellurolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of low&#8208;coordinate, monomeric europium(II) and ytterbium(II) tellurolate complexes is achieved using hybrid tellurolate ligands containing N&#8208;donor pendant arms. According to DFT calculations, while the complexes have most of their lanthanoid&#8208;tellurium bonds located on the Te atoms, the lanthanoid metals contribute significantly to the bond, thus resulting in a notable covalency.







Abstract
Owing to the strict hard/soft dichotomy between the lanthanoids and tellurium atoms, and the strong affinity of lanthanoid ions for high coordination numbers, low&#8208;coordinate, monomeric lanthanoid tellurolate complexes have remained elusive as compared to the lanthanoid complexes with lighter group 16 elements (O, S, and Se). This makes the development of suitable ligand systems for low&#8208;coordinate, monomeric lanthanoid tellurolate complexes an appealing endeavor. In a first report, a series of low&#8208;coordinate, monomeric lanthanoid (Yb, Eu) tellurolate complexes were synthesized by utilizing hybrid organotellurolate ligands containing N&#8208;donor pendant arms. The reaction of bis[2&#8208;((dimethylamino)methyl)phenyl] ditelluride, 1 and 8,8&#8242;diquinolinyl ditelluride, 2 with Ln0 metals (Ln=Eu, Yb) resulted in the formation of monomeric complexes [LnII(TeR)2(Solv)2] [R=C6H4&#8208;2&#8208;CH2NMe2] [3: Ln=Eu, Solv=tetrahydrofuran; 4: Ln=Eu, Solv=acetonitrile; 5: Ln=Yb, Solv=tetrahydrofuran; 6: Ln=Yb, Solv=pyridine] and [EuII(TeNC9H6)2(Solv)n] (7: Solv=tetrahydrofuran, n=3; 8: Solv=1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane, n=2), respectively. Complexes 3&#8211;4 and 7&#8211;8 represent the first sets of examples of monomeric europium tellurolate complexes. The molecular structures of complexes 3&#8211;8 are validated by single&#8211;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. The electronic structures of these complexes were investigated using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, which revealed appreciable covalency between the tellurolate ligands and lanthanoids.

         <title>Fast Visualized Conformational Transition of Polyphenylacetylenes with Stepwise Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel thermoresponsive polyphenylacetylene shows reversible conformation transition, fluorescent and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switch. The conformational transition could be read out via the change of visible fluorescence signals. Moreover, the polymers displayed switchable CPL performance and the luminescent dissymmetry factor could be stepwise amplified by forming chiral aggregates or liquid crystalline structure.







Abstract
Two novel poly(3,5&#8208;diamide substituted phenylacetylene)s bearing L&#8208; or D&#8208;alanine residues with a long alkyl chain were synthesized. In low polar or apolar solvents, the polymers adopted contracted cis&#8208;cisoid helix showing strong yellow fluorescence, which was transferred to stretched cis&#8208;transoid helix by adding polar solvents or decreasing temperature, accompanied with the disappearance of fluorescence. The critical conformational transition temperature could be readily tuned in a wide range by altering the content of polar solvent, and the conformational variation at molecular level could be directly read out via the change in fluorescent property. The synergistical participation of amide and ester groups in the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds accelerated the conformational transition rate, resulting in remarkable reduction of hysteresis. Moreover, the polymers displayed switchable CPL performance and the luminescent dissymmetry factor could be stepwise amplified by forming chiral aggregates or liquid crystalline structure.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A novel thermoresponsive polyphenylacetylene&lt;/b&gt; shows reversible conformation transition, fluorescent and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switch. The conformational transition could be read out via the change of visible fluorescence signals. Moreover, the polymers displayed switchable CPL performance and the luminescent dissymmetry factor could be stepwise amplified by forming chiral aggregates or liquid crystalline structure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two novel poly(3,5-diamide substituted phenylacetylene)s bearing &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;- or &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;-alanine residues with a long alkyl chain were synthesized. In low polar or apolar solvents, the polymers adopted contracted &lt;i&gt;cis-cisoid&lt;/i&gt; helix showing strong yellow fluorescence, which was transferred to stretched &lt;i&gt;cis-transoid&lt;/i&gt; helix by adding polar solvents or decreasing temperature, accompanied with the disappearance of fluorescence. The critical conformational transition temperature could be readily tuned in a wide range by altering the content of polar solvent, and the conformational variation at molecular level could be directly read out via the change in fluorescent property. The synergistical participation of amide and ester groups in the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds accelerated the conformational transition rate, resulting in remarkable reduction of hysteresis. Moreover, the polymers displayed switchable CPL performance and the luminescent dissymmetry factor could be stepwise amplified by forming chiral aggregates or liquid crystalline structure. This study may open a new avenue for the development of controllable helical structure-based smart CPL materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Push&#8208;Pull Bridged Distyrylbenzene with Highly Bright Solid&#8208;State Red&#8208;Orange Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission</title>

A red&#8208;emitting aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) is realized by introducing a bridging structure into push&#8208;pull distyrylbenzene.







Abstract
Multiple emission colors in solid&#8208;state organic fluorophores with the same main skeleton are essential for improving the performance of light&#8208;emitting devices/materials. Specifically, emission in the red/near&#8208;infrared region is of great importance in the biological field. Previously, we developed di&#8208;bridged&#8208;distyrylbenzene DBDB[7] with high&#8208;brightness solid&#8208;state blue and aggregation&#8208;induced emissions (AIE) by introducing the bridging structures of a seven&#8208;membered ring into the vinylene groups of distyrylbenzene (DSB). Herein, we synthesize MNDBDMeODB[7] (1), which features substituted methoxy and malononitrile groups as donor and acceptor groups, respectively, in DBDB[7]. In solvents more polar than THF, MNDSDMeOB (3), which has the same main skeleton as 1 but without bridges, shows no emission in the solid state, whereas 1 exhibits highly bright red&#8208;orange emission in the solid state owing to the suppression of intermolecular electronic interactions by the bridges and the AIE property. We also synthesize MNDSD(EHO)B (2) in which the methoxy groups of 3 are replaced by ethylhexyloxy groups, thus disrupting the crystallinity of the molecule. 2 exhibits positive fluorescence solvatochromism and has a high fluorescence quantum yield in the solid state as a red&#8208;emitting DSB derivative. The solid&#8208;state emission properties of 1 and 2 will improve the applicability of DSBs and functionalities of light&#8208;emitting devices/materials.

         <title>Dipole&#8208;Transmissive 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions for the Rapid Construction of Polycyclic N&#8208;Heterocycles: Synthetic and Mechanistic Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigation into and formalisation of dipole&#8208;transmissive dipolar cycloaddition (DTDC) methodology is reported. By designing substrates bearing complementary azide and diazoalkane 1,3&#8208;dipoles, we were able to employ integrated experimental and theoretical studies to construct a series of polycyclic N&#8208;heterocycles and rationalise the mechanistic basis of the divergent reactivity observed.







Abstract
The investigation of distinctive dipole&#8208;transmissive dipolar cycloaddition (DTDC) methodology and the formalisation of this concept is reported. A DTDC procedure was able to be developed by taking advantage of the structural complementarity of azide and diazoalkane 1,3&#8208;dipoles. Intramolecular azide&#8208;alkene 1,3&#8208;DCs followed by spontaneous dipole transmission upon work&#8208;up furnished intermediate &#945;&#8208;diazoisoindole and &#945;&#8208;diazoisoquinoline substrates bearing the key secondary diazoalkane 1,3&#8208;dipole. N&#8208;Derivatisation of the intermediate &#945;&#8208;diazoisoindole and &#945;&#8208;diazoisoquinolines with a tethered secondary dipolarophile followed by a subsequent 1,3&#8208;DC allowed for rapid construction of a range of functionalised polycyclic N&#8208;heterocycles. Integrated experimental and theoretical studies established requirements for product formation and revealed the likely mechanistic basis of divergent reactivity observed.

         <title>Persistent and Predominantly Localized Boron Radical from the Reduction of a Three&#8208;Dimensional Analogue of NHC&#8208;Stabilized Borafluorenium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;electron reduction of a 3D NHC&#8208;stabilized 9&#8208;borafluorenium cation leads to the formation of a persistent 3D 9&#8208;borafluorene radical that exhibits remarkable stability in both solid and solution states. Single crystal structure, EPR analysis, and theoretical studies indicate that the unpaired electron is predominantly located on boron.







Abstract
In this contribution, we reported the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) analogues of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;stabilized 9&#8208;borafluorenium and 9&#8208;borafluorene radical. The radical was fully characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV), UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. The distinct boron&#8208;centered radical character of 9&#8208;borafluorene radical was corroborated by DFT calculations and EPR analysis.

         <title>Balanced Energy Gaps as a Key Design Rule for Solution&#8208;Phase Organic Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution&#8208;phase room temperature phosphorescence is very rare in all&#8208;organic emitters. Here we show how this property can emerge as a function of energy gaps between the phosphorescent state and higher energy charge&#8208;transfer states. An optimal gap of &#8764;0.4&#8197;eV yields efficient phosphorescence, with smaller gaps leading to thermally activated delayed fluorescence and larger gaps allowing triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation to dominate.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free organic emitters that display solution&#8208;phase room temperature phosphorescence (sRTP) remain exceedingly rare. Here, we investigate the structural and photophysical properties that support sRTP by comparing a recently reported sRTP compound (BTaz&#8722;Th&#8722;PXZ) to two novel analogous materials, replacing the donor group by either acridine or phenothiazine. The emissive triplet excited state remains fixed in all three cases, while the emissive charge&#8208;transfer singlet states (and the calculated paired charge&#8208;transfer T2 state) vary with the donor unit. While all three materials show dominant RTP in film, in solution different singlet&#8208;triplet and triplet&#8208;triplet energy gaps give rise to triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation followed by weak sRTP for the new compounds, compared to dominant sRTP throughout for the original PXZ material. Engineering both the sRTP state and higher charge&#8208;transfer states therefore emerges as a crucial element in designing emitters capable of sRTP.

         <title>A Mild Synthesis of Aryl Triflates Enabling the Late&#8208;Stage Modification of Drug Analogs and Complex Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a highly convenient strategy to convert phenols into the corresponding aryl triflates using a newly discovered reagent in presence of a fluoride source. The reactions are generally complete within a few minutes at room temperature. The mild conditions allow the late&#8208;stage O&#8208;triflation of complex peptides bearing challenging side chains like arginine and histidine. We show that aryl triflates can be an interesting moiety for medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
We report the discovery of a straightforward protocol to convert phenols into the corresponding aryl triflates using 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;one in the presence of a fluoride source. This novel reagent can be handled without any precautions to exclude air or moisture making this method highly convenient. The reactions generally show very clean conversions within only a few minutes at room temperature. The mild conditions allow the so far unprecedented O&#8208;triflation of tyrosine in peptides bearing challenging side chains present for example in arginine and histidine including the late&#8208;stage triflation of complex bioactive peptides. We show how aryl triflates &#8211; an interesting but so far underutilized group &#8211; can be used to optimize physicochemical and in&#8197;vitro properties of compound series in medicinal chemistry. We believe that this method is highly attractive for applications in peptide functionalization as well as automated and medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Synthesis of a Benzotrisazulene via Trioxobenzotrisazulene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benzotrisazulene was synthesized on the basis of a truxene precursor by a series of Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reactions via the intermediate trisoxo compound. The latter occurs in two forms (syn and anti), and the syn forms porous crystals.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) containing odd&#8208;membered rings (such as pentagons or heptagons) are fascinating synthetic targets. A special case is the introduction of five&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered rings in form of an azulene unit. Azulene itself is an aromatic compounds known for its deep blue color, which is a result of its internal dipole moment. When azulene is embedded into PAHs it can change the optoelectronic properties of the PAH significantly. Herein, the synthesis and characterization of a PAH containing three azulene units is reported via reduction and elimination of its trioxo derivative.

We present the inferences from the mechanistic studies on the catalytic reduction of ketones and phosphine oxides using the organobismuth dication [NMe2C6H4Bi(L)3][Al{OC(CF3)3}4] in the presence of silanes as reducing agents. Experiments and computations converge to a Si&#8722;H activation pathway in the reduction process.

         <title>Generation and Characterization of a Tetraradical Embedded in a Curved Cyclic Paraphenylene Unit</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetraradical embedded in a curved cycloparaphenylene skeleton was generated and characterized to examine the reactivity and magnetic interaction of the two diradical units in the bent molecular structure. Ferromagnetic interactions within the diradical unit and antiferromagnetic interaction between the diradical units lead to an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state for the tetraradical.







Abstract
Unique spin&#8211;spin (magnetic) interactions, ring&#8208;size effects on ground&#8208;state spin multiplicity, and in&#8208;plane aromaticity has been found in localized 1,3&#8208;diradicals embedded in curved benzene structures such as cycloparaphenylene (CPP). In this study, we characterized the magnetic interactions in a tetraradical consisting of two localized 1,3&#8208;diradical units connected by p&#8208;quaterphenyl within a curved CPP skeleton by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. Persistent triplet species with zero&#8208;field splitting parameters similar to those of a triplet 1,3&#8208;diphenylcyclopentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyl diradical were observed by continuous wave (CW) or pulsed X&#8208;band EPR measurements. The quintet state derived from the ferromagnetic interaction between the two triplet diradical moieties was not detected at 20&#8197;K under glassy matrix conditions. At the B3LYP/6&#8208;31G(d) level of theory, the singlet state was lower in energy than the triplet and quintet states. These findings will aid in the development of open&#8208;shell species for material science application.

         <title>Cover Feature: Persistent and Predominantly Localized Boron Radical from the Reduction of a Three&#8208;Dimensional Analogue of NHC&#8208;Stabilized Borafluorenium (Chem. Eur. J. 42/2023)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A persistent and predominantly localized boron radical has been synthesized by the single&#8208;electron reduction of a 3D analogue of an NHC&#8208;stabilized 9&#8208;borafluorenium cation. The steric and electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of the 1,1&#8217;&#8208;bis(o&#8208;carborane) backbone and the almost perpendicular orientation of the NHC ligand give rise to the distinct boron&#8208;centered radical character, as evidenced by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, EPR spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. More information can be found in the Research Article by Q. Ye and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301270).

Organic afterglow nanoparticles are unique optical materials that emit light long after cessation of excitation. Due to their advantages of no need of real&#8208;time light excitation, avoiding autofluorescence, low imaging background, high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio, deep tissue penetration and high sensitivity, afterglow imaging technology has been widely used in cell tracking, biosensing, cancer diagnosis and cancer therapy, which provides an effective technical method for the acquisition of molecular information with high sensitivity, specificity and real&#8208;time at the cellular and living level.

Due to their advantages of no need for real&#8208;time light excitation, avoiding autofluorescence, low imaging background, high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio, deep tissue penetration, and high sensitivity, afterglow imaging technology has been widely used in cell tracking, biosensing, cancer diagnosis, and cancer therapy, which provides an effective technical method for the acquisition of molecular information with high sensitivity, specificity and real&#8208;time at the cellular and living level. In this review, we summarize and illustrate the recent progress of organic afterglow imaging, focusing on the mechanism of organic afterglow materials and their biological application. Furthermore, we also discuss the potential challenges and the further directions of this field.

         <title>Skeletal Editing of (Hetero)Arenes Using Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments in the skeletal editing of (hetero)arenes using carbenes, with an emphasis on the scope, reactivity, selectivity, and general mechanistic considerations. The impressive breadth of application of this strategy in both drug discovery and total synthesis is also discussed. Existing challenges and perspectives on future research directions to further understanding and new reaction developments are outlined.







Abstract
(Hetero)arenes continue to prove their indispensability in pharmaceuticals, materials science, and synthetic chemistry. As such, the controllable modification of biologically significant (hetero)arenes towards diverse more&#8208;potent complex molecular scaffolds through peripheral and skeletal editing has been considered a challenging goal in synthetic organic chemistry. Despite many excellent reviews on peripheral editing (i.&#8201;e., C&#8722;H functionalization) of (hetero)arenes, their skeletal editings via single atom insertion, deletion, or transmutations have received less attention in the review literature. In this review, we systematically summarize the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art skeletal editing reactions of (hetero)arenes using carbenes, with a focus on general mechanistic considerations and their applications in natural product syntheses. The potential opportunities and inherent challenges encountered while developing these strategies are also highlighted.

The acid&#8208;base equilibrium between the pyrazole and the pyrazolato forms of Mn(L1)(CO)3Br was studied by 1H NMR and UV&#8208;vis spectra. These complexes are screened as catalysts for acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling (ADC) of primary alcohols and aromatic diamines for the synthesis of benzimidazole and quinoline derivatives with the release of H2 and H2O as byproducts. The protic complex Mn(L1)(CO)3Br shows the highest catalytic activity for the synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted benzimidazole derivatives with broad substrate scope, whereas a related complex [Mn(L3)(CO)3Br], which is devoid of the proton responsive &#946;&#8208;NH unit, shows significantly reduced catalytic efficiency validating the crucial role of the &#946;&#8208;NH functionality for the alcohol dehydrogenation reactions. Control experiments, kinetic and deuterated studies, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a synchronous hydride&#8208;proton transfer by the metal&#8208;ligand construct in the alcohol dehydrogenation step.</dc:description>

         <title>Substitution Effects on the Photophysical and Photoredox Properties of Tetraaza[7]helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of substituted polyaza[7]helicenes were synthesized and their (photo)physical properties and capabilities as photoredox catalysts were investigated. DFT calculations on the derivatives and three more model compounds were performed to predict the photoredox properties of these compounds.







Abstract
A series of substituted derivatives of tetraaza[7]helicenes were synthesized and the influence of the substitution on their photophysical and photoredox&#8208;catalytic properties was studied. The combination of their high fluorescence quantum yields of up to 0.65 and their circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity results in CPL brightness values (BCPL) that are among the highest recorded for [7]helicenes so far. A sulfonylation/hetarylation reaction using cyanopyridines as substrates for photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from the excited helicenes was conducted to test for viability in photoredox catalysis. DFT calculations predict the introduction of electron withdrawing substituents to yield more oxidizing catalysts.

         <title>Base&#8208;stabilized phosphinidene oxide, imide and sulfide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidation of a base&#8208;stabilised phosphinidene (k2&#8208;NNP)P (12, NNP= phosphinoamidinate) with N2O afforded a labile phopshinidene oxide (k2&#8208;NNP)P=O (16) which was characterized by NMR spectroscopy. Further oxidation of 16 by N2O or reaction of 12 with two equivalents of pyridine oxide afforded the isolable dioxide (k2&#8208;NNP)PO2 which was characterized by NMR and SC XRD. Trapping of 16 with tolyl Isocyanate resulted in P=O/N=C metathesis, eventually affording a urea&#8208;ligated phosphine (k1&#8208;NNP)P(NTol)2C=O (17) The mechanism of this reaction was elucidated by DFT calculations. Reactions of phosphinidene 12 with azides generated transient imines (NNP)P=NR, which in the case of R=Tol underwent cycloaddition with tolyl Isocyanate to afford the urea product 17, and in the case of R=SiMe3 reacts with N3SiMe3 via the addition of N&#8208;Si across the P=N bond affording, after the extrusion of dinitrogen, a P,N&#8208;heterocyclic compound. Both products of the reactions with azides have been fully characterized, both in solution and the solid&#8208;state. Finally, reaction of phosphinidene 12 with one equivalent of sulfur resulted in the isolation of the base&#8208;stabilized phosphinidene sulfide (k2&#8208;NNP)P=S that has also been fully characterized.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We prepared and characterized (UV&#8208;vis, epr, X&#8208;ray) four substituted nonacenes. They are the most stable and soluble nonacenes to date &#8211; due to six strategically placed triisopropylsilyl (TIPS)&#8208;ethynyl groups. They are stable for several weeks in the solid state. In dilute solution their half&#8208;life is 5&#8208;9&#160;h. Crystal structure analyses of two nonacenes prove their structures. A nonacene derivative was tested in a solution&#8208;processed transistor and exhibits ambipolar charge transport (&#181;e=0.007 cm2/Vs; &#181;h=0.023 cm2/Vs).</dc:description>

         <title>Strain&#8208;driven, non&#8208;catalysed ring expansion of silicon heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silacycles are ubiquitous building blocks. Small silacycles can typically be expanded catalytically. We have prepared a silirane (1), silirene (2) and phosphasilirene (3) as well as a siletane (4) and a silolene (5) starting from the base&#8208;free bromosilylene [(dtbpCbz)SiBr]. As these heterocycles were derived from a dicoordinated silylene, they are susceptible to reactions with an external base. The three&#8208;membered silacycles readily undergo non&#8208;catalysed ring expansion reactions with isonitriles yielding the related four&#8208;membered silacycles. Surprisingly, the ring&#8208;expanded derivatives of the silirane 1 undergo up to two further isomerisation reactions, first by enamine formation and then by another ring expansion. DFT computations were utilised to gauge the scope of this reactivity pattern. Three&#8208;membered silacycles should essentially universally undergo a ring expansion with isonitriles, while for four&#8208;membered silacycles, only very few instances are predicted to accommodate more challenging kinetic requirements of this ring expansion. Larger silacycles lack the ring strain energy required for this ring expansion reaction and are not expected to be expanded.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Electrophilic Mononuclear Cationic Aluminium Alkoxide Complexes: Syntheses, Reactivity and Catalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New cationic aluminium complexes with terminal alkoxy substituents (&#8722;OMe and &#8722;OtBu) are reported; these showed markedly higher Lewis acidity than the known hydride and methyl analogues, as evident from their Gutmann&#8208;Beckett test, NBO analysis and hydride ion affinity calculations. These complexes activate triethylsilane and are good catalysts for the hydrosilylation of ethers, carbonyls, and alkene.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;diketiminate&#8208;supported aluminium complexes bearing terminal alkoxide and mono&#8208;thiol functional groups: LAlOMe(Et) (2), LAlOtBu(Et) (3), and LAlSH(Et) (4), (L=[HC{C(Me)N&#8208;(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)}2]). Complexes 2 and 3 are further used as synthons to generate the fascinating cationic aluminium alkoxide complexes, [LAlOMe(&#956;&#8208;OMe)&#8208;Al(Et)L][EtB(C6F5)3] (5), [LAlOMe(OEt2)][EtB(C6F5)3] (6), and [LAlOtBu(OEt2)][EtB(C6F5)3] (8). These electrophilic cationic species are well characterized by spectroscopic and crystallographic techniques. The assessment of Lewis acidity by the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method revealed superior Lewis acidity of the cations substituted with electron&#8208;demanding alkoxy groups in comparison to the known methyl analogue [LAlMe][B(C6F5)4]. This has been further endorsed by computational calculations to determine the NBO charges and hydride ion affinity for complexes 6 and 8. These complexes are also capable of activating triethylsilane in stoichiometric reactions. The applicability of these complexes has been realized in the hydrosilylation of ethers, carbonyls, and olefines. Additionally, the solid&#8208;state structure of a new THF stabilized aluminium halide cation [LAlCl(THF)][B(C6F5)4] (11) has also been reported.

         <title>Dimetalloylene (M&#8208;E&#8208;M) Complexes of Heavier Main Group Elements Ge, Sn, Pb, Bi via Cleavage of E&#8208;X Bonds (X=N(SiMe3)2, OtBu) with an Iridium Hydride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of an iridium tetrahydride (LIrH4, L=DippNacnac) with main&#8208;group (E=Sn, Pb, Bi) amides/alkoxides results in the extrusion of amines/alcohols with formation of iridium dimetallotetrylenes (LIrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;E)2. Computational investigations of the Ir2E2 (E=Sn, Pb) compounds characterized them as open&#8208;shell singlets; in contrast, Ir2Bi2 is characterized as having a closed&#8208;shell singlet ground state.







Abstract
Reactions of the IrV hydride [MeBDIDipp]IrH4 {BDI=(Dipp)NC(Me)CH(Me)CN(Dipp); Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3} with E[N(SiMe3)2]2 (E=Sn, Pb) afforded the unusual dimeric dimetallotetrylenes ([MeBDIDipp]IrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;E)2 in good yields. Moreover, ([MeBDIDipp]IrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;Ge)2 was formed in&#8197;situ from thermal decomposition of [MeBDIDipp]Ir(H)2Ge[N(SiMe3)2]2. These reactions are accompanied by liberation of HN(SiMe3)2 and H2 through the apparent cleavage of an E&#8722;N(SiMe3)2 bond by Ir&#8722;H. In a reversal of this process, ([MeBDIDipp]IrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;E)2 reacted with excess H2 to regenerate [MeBDIDipp]IrH4. Varying the concentrations of reactants led to formation of the trimeric ([MeBDIDipp]IrH2)3(&#956;2&#8208;E)3. The further scope of this synthetic route was investigated with group&#8197;15 amides, and ([MeBDIDipp]IrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;Bi)2 was prepared by the reaction of [MeBDIDipp]IrH4 with Bi(NMe2)3 or Bi(OtBu)3 to afford the first example of a &#8220;naked&#8221; two&#8208;coordinate Bi atom bound exclusively to transition metals. A viable mechanism that accounts for the formation of these products is proposed. Computational investigations of the Ir2E2 (E=Sn, Pb) compounds characterized them as open&#8208;shell singlets with confined nonbonding lone pairs at the E centers. In contrast, Ir2Bi2 is characterized as having a closed&#8208;shell singlet ground state.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Substituted Phosphasilenes and its Rare Homologue Stibasilene &gt;Si=Sb&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amidinate stabilized low valent phosphasilenes &gt;Si=P&#8722; and a heavier homologue stibasilene &gt;Si=Sb&#8722; are reported. Compounds 1, 2, and 3 are heavy analogues of imine or Schiff base. In both phosphorus compounds, Si exhibits double bond character. All compounds were fully characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and 1 and 2 also by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.







Abstract
Herein we report the reduction of R&#8208;EX2 (E=P, Sb) with two equivalents of KC8 in the presence of silylene (LSiR; L=PhC(NtBu)2) to give Trip&#8208;P=SiL(C6H4PPh2) (1), TerPh&#8722;P=(tBu)SiL (2) and TerPh&#8722;Sb=(tBu)SiL (3). The last (3) belongs to a new class of heavier analogues of Schiff bases (&gt;C=N&#8722;), containing a formal &gt;Si=Sb&#8722; double bond. The theoretical calculations suggest that lone pairs on the dicoordinated group&#8208;15 centers are stabilized by hyperconjugative interactions resulting in pseudo&#8208;Si&#8722;P/Si&#8722;Sb multiple bonds which are highly reactive as indicated by the high first and second proton affinities.

All compounds were fully characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; also by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein we report the reduction of R-EX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (E=P, Sb) with two equivalents of KC&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; in the presence of silylene (LSiR; L=PhC(N&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to give Trip-P=SiL(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), &lt;sup&gt;Ter&lt;/sup&gt;Ph&#8722;P=(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu)SiL (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) and &lt;sup&gt;Ter&lt;/sup&gt;Ph&#8722;Sb=(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu)SiL (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;). The last (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) belongs to a new class of heavier analogues of Schiff bases (&amp;gt;C=N&#8722;), containing a formal &amp;gt;Si=Sb&#8722; double bond. The theoretical calculations suggest that lone pairs on the dicoordinated group-15 centers are stabilized by hyperconjugative interactions resulting in pseudo-Si&#8722;P/Si&#8722;Sb multiple bonds which are highly reactive as indicated by the high first and second proton affinities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Autofluorescent Artemisinin&#8208;Benzimidazole Hybrids via Organo&#8208;Click Reaction: Study of Antiviral Properties and Mode of Action in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general concept for the easy formation of fluorescent hybrid drugs by combining two readily available non&#8208;fluorescent pharmacophores via a non&#8208;cleavable linker using an organo&#8208;click reaction is presented. In vitro investigation of new antiviral hybrid compounds revealed that they change mitochondrial structures. The developed approach offers facilitated insight into drug modes of action in living cells, avoiding the need for its linkage to external fluorescent markers.







Abstract
Drug modification by a fluorescent label is a common tool for studying its mechanism of action with fluorescence microscopy techniques. However, the attachment of a fluorescent label can significantly alter the polarity, solubility, and biological activity of the investigated drug, and, as a result, the studied mechanism of action can be misrepresented. Therefore, developing efficient drugs, which are inherently fluorescent and can be tracked directly in the cell is highly favorable. Here an easy formation of fluorescent hybrid drugs is presented, generated by a combination of two readily available non&#8208;fluorescent pharmacophores via a non&#8208;cleavable linker using a Ramachary&#8208;Bressy&#8208;Wang organocatalyzed azide&#8208;carbonyl [3+2] cycloaddition (organo&#8208;click) reaction. All newly prepared fluorescent compounds showed strong anti&#8208;HCMV activity (EC50 down to 0.07&#177;0.00&#8197;&#956;M), thus presenting a very promising drug developmental basis compared to the approved drug ganciclovir (EC50 2.60&#177;0.50&#8197;&#956;M). Remarkably, in&#8197;vitro fluorescent imaging investigation of new compounds revealed induced changes in mitochondrial structures, which is a phenotypical hallmark of antiviral activity. This approach opens up new vistas for the easy formation of potent fluorescent drugs from readily available non&#8208;fluorescent parent compounds and might facilitate insight into their mode of action in living cells, avoiding the requirement of linkage to external fluorescent markers.

         <title>Unexpected Coexisting Solid Solutions in the Quasi&#8208;Binary Ag(II)F2/Cu(II)F2 Phase Diagram
</title>

Despite large difference of ionic radii of Cu(II) and Ag(II) cations, difluorides of these metals readily form two structurally related solid solutions, which recite the structural polytypes of parent compounds.







Abstract
High&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state reaction between orthorhombic AgF2 and monoclinic CuF2 (y=0.15, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5) in a fluorine atmosphere resulted in coexisting solid solutions of Cu&#8208;poor orthorhombic and Cu&#8208;rich monoclinic phases with stoichiometry Ag1&#8722;xCuxF2. Based on X&#8208;ray powder diffraction analyses, the mutual solubility in the orthorhombic phase (AgF2&#8201;:&#8201;Cu) appears to be at an upper limit of Cu concentration of 30&#8197;mol&#8201;% (Ag0.7Cu0.3F2), while the monoclinic phase (CuF2&#8201;:&#8201;Ag) can form a nearly stoichiometric Cu&#8201;:&#8201;Ag=1&#8201;:&#8201;1 solid solution (Cu0.56Ag0.44F2), preserving the CuF2 crystal structure. Experimental data and DFT calculations showed that AgF2&#8201;:&#8201;Cu and CuF2&#8201;:&#8201;Ag solid solutions deviate from the classical Vegard's law. Magnetic measurements of Ag1&#8722;xCuxF2 showed that the N&#233;el temperature (TN) decreases with increasing Cu content in both phases. Likewise, theoretical DFT+U calculations for Ag1&#8722;xCuxF2 showed that the progressive substitution of Ag by Cu decreases the magnetic interaction strength |J2D| in both structures. Electrical conductivity measurements of Ag0.85Cu0.15F2 showed a modest increase in specific ionic conductivity (3.71&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;13&#177;2.6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;15&#8197;S/cm) as compared to pure AgF2 (1.85&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;13&#177;1.2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;15&#8197;S/cm), indicating the formation of a vacancy&#8208; or F adatom&#8208;free metal difluoride sample.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface modification of indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes with organic molecules is known to tune their work function which results in higher charge carrier selectivity in corresponding organic electronic devices and hence influences the performance of organic solar cells. In recent years, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have also been proven to be capable to modify the work function of metals and semimetals compared to the unfunctionalized surface via the formation of strong covalent bonds. In this report, we have designed and performed the modification of the ITO surface with NHC by using the zwitterionic bench stable IPr&#8208;CO2 as the NHC precursor, applied via spin coating. Upon modification, the work function of ITO electrodes was reduced significantly which resulted in electron selective contacts in corresponding organic photovoltaic devices. In addition, various characterization techniques and analytical methods are used to elucidate the nature of the bound species and the corresponding binding mechanism of the material to the ITO surface.</dc:description>

Organo photocatalyst: Visible light enabled metal&#8208;free redox&#8208;neutral direct C3&#8722;H alkylation/arylation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones with Inert alkyl and aryl chlorides have been reported.







Abstract
In the present manuscript, we reported the first visible&#8208;light&#8208;enabled direct C3&#8722;H alkylation/arylation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones with unactivated alkyl/aryl chlorides under metal&#8208;free conditions. A wide range of unactivated alkyl and aryl chlorides containing different functionalities are coupled with a variety of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one derivatives under mild reaction conditions to afford the C3&#8208;alkyl/aryl substituted quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones in moderate to good yields.

         <title>Surface Engineering in Covalent Organic Polymers for High&#8208;Performance Li&#8722;S Batteries</title>

Surface engineering of covalent organic polymers has been performed to investigate the relationship between structure and property by experiments and DFT calculations, which provides a feasible guidance for the design of effective porous cathode materials.







Abstract
Lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries are a promising energy storage technology due to their tempting high theoretical capacity and energy density. Nevertheless, the wastage of active materials that originates from the shuttling effect of polysulfides still hinders advancement of Li&#8722;S batteries. The effective design of cathode materials is extremely pivotal to solve this thorny problem. Herein, surface engineering in covalent organic polymers (COPs) has been performed to investigate the influence of pore wall polarity on the performance of COP&#8208;based cathodes used for Li&#8722;S batteries. With the assistance of experimental investigation and theoretical calculations, performance improvement by increasing pore surface polarity and a synergy effect of the polarized functionalities, along with nano&#8208;confinement effect of the COPs, are disclosed, to which the improved performance of Li&#8722;S batteries including outstanding Coulombic efficiency (99.0&#8201;%) and extremely low capacity decay (0.08&#8201;% over 425 cycles at 1.0&#8197;C) is attributed. This work not only enlightens the designable synthesis and applications of covalent polymers as polar sulfur hosts with high utilization of active materials, but also provides a feasible guide for the design of effective cathode materials for future advanced Li&#8722;S batteries.

More Me: The curved &#960;&#8208;conjugated surface of bowl&#8208;shaped corannulene is multiply methylated by reductive methylation with sodium dispersion and reduction&#8208;resistant dimethyl sulfate. The in&#8208;situ iterative reduction/methylation processes form exo&#8208;di&#8208;, &#8208;tetra&#8208;, and &#8208;hexamethylated corannulenes.

Abstract
The curved &#960;&#8208;conjugated surface of bowl&#8208;shaped corannulene has been multiply methylated to form exo&#8208;di&#8208;, &#8208;tetra&#8208;, and &#8208;hexamethylated corannulenes. The multimethylations became possible through in&#8208;situ iterative reduction/methylation sequences that involve the reduction of corannulenes using sodium to form the anionic corannulene species, and the subsequent SN2 reaction of the anionic species with reduction&#8208;resistant dimethyl sulfate. X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, NMR, MS, UV&#8208;Vis measurements, and DFT calculations have revealed the molecular structures of the multimethylated corannulenes and the sequence of the multimethylation. This work has the potential to contribute to the controlled synthesis and characterizations of multifunctionalized fullerenes.

Its molecular structure and UV&#8208;induced photochemistry were investigated using matrix isolation IR and EPR spectroscopies together with quantum chemical calculations, undertaken at the DFT(B3LYP)/6&#8208;311++G(3df,3pd) level of theory.







Abstract
The molecular structure and photochemistry of dispiro[cyclohexane&#8208;1,3&#8242;&#8208;[1,2,4,5]tetraoxane&#8208;6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]decan]&#8208;4&#8208;one (TX), an antiparasitic 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetraoxane was investigated using matrix isolation IR and EPR spectroscopies, together with quantum chemical calculations undertaken at the DFT(B3LYP)/6&#8208;311++G(3df,3pd) level of theory, with and without Grimme's dispersion correction. Photolysis of the matrix&#8208;isolated TX, induced by in&#8197;situ broadband (&#955;&gt;235&#8197;nm) or narrowband (&#955; in the range 220&#8211;263&#8197;nm) irradiation, led to new bands in the infrared spectrum that could be ascribed to two distinct photoproducts, oxepane&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione, and 4&#8208;oxohomoadamantan&#8208;5&#8208;one. Our studies show that these photoproducts result from initial photoinduced cleavage of an O&#8722;O bond, with the formation of an oxygen&#8208;centered diradical that regioselectivity rearranges to a more stable (secondary carbon&#8208;centered)/(oxygen&#8208;centered) diradical, yielding the final products. Formation of the diradical species was confirmed by EPR measurements, upon photolysis of the compound at &#955;=266&#8197;nm, in acetonitrile ice (T=10&#8211;80&#8197;K). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) studies demonstrated that the TX molecule adopts nearly the same conformation in the crystal and matrix&#8208;isolation conditions, revealing that the intermolecular interactions in the TX crystal are weak. This result is in keeping with observed similarities between the infrared spectrum of the crystalline material and that of matrix&#8208;isolated TX. The detailed structural, vibrational, and photochemical data reported here appear relevant to the practical uses of TX in medicinal chemistry, considering its efficient and broad parasiticidal properties.

The rare earth element complexes (Ln=Y, La, Sm, Lu, Ce) of several &#954;6N&#8208;coordinating tripodal ligands have been synthetized and characterized. After estimation of their donor capabilities, the ligands selectivity through the lanthanide cations have been investigated.







Abstract
The rare earth element complexes (Ln=Y, La, Sm, Lu, Ce) of several podant &#954;6N&#8208;coordinating ligands have been synthetized and thoroughly characterized. The structural properties of the complexes have been investigated by X&#8208;ray diffraction in the solid state and by advanced NMR methods in solution. To estimate the donor capabilities of the presented ligands, an experimental comparison study has been conducted by cyclic voltammetry as well as absorption experiments using the cerium complexes and by analyzing 89Y&#8197;NMR chemical shifts of the different yttrium complexes. In order to obtain a complete and detailed picture, all experiments were corroborated by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum chemical calculations. Finally, coordination competition studies have been carried out by means of 1H and 31P&#8197;NMR spectroscopy to investigate the correlation with donor properties and selectivity.

Finally, coordination competition studies have been carried out by means of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P&#8197;NMR spectroscopy to investigate the correlation with donor properties and selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Selective &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of &#946;&#8208;Naphthols using Primary Alcohols: Elucidating the Influence of Base and Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalized arenes and arenols have diverse applications in chemical synthesis and material chemistry. Selective functionalization of arenols is a topic of prime interest. In particular, direct alkylation of arenols using alcohols is a challenging task. In this report, a ruthenium pincer catalyzed direct a&#8208;alkylation of b&#8208;naphthol using primary alcohols as alkylating reagents is reported. Notably, aryl and heteroaryl methanols and linear and branched aliphatic alcohols underwent selective alkylation reactions, in which water is the only byproduct. Notably, catalytically derived a&#8208;alkyl&#8208;b&#8208;naphthol products displayed high absorbance, emissive properties, and quantum yields (up to 93.2%). Dearomative bromination on a&#8208;alkyl&#8208;b&#8208;naphthol is demonstrated as a synthetic application.&#160; Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction involves an aldehyde intermediate. DFT studies support this finding and further reveal that a stoichiometric amount of base is required to make the aldol condensation as well as elementary steps required for regeneration of catalytically active species. In situ&#8208;generated water molecule from the aldol condensation reaction plays an important role in the regeneration of an active catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable and Reusable Fe3O4/ZIF&#8208;8 Composite for Encapsulation of FDH Enzyme under Mild Conditions Applicable to CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in&#8208;situ encapsulation of the formate dehydrogenase (FDH) enzyme during the aqueous synthesis of ZIF&#8208;8 in the presence of magnetite yields a bio&#8208;composed system with long&#8208;time hydrostability and excellent reusability. The immobilization strategy enhances the catalytic activity in formic acid production from 300 (free FDH) to 1015&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8197;mg&#8722;1.







Abstract
The enzymatic reduction of carbon dioxide presents limited applicability due to denaturation and the impossibility of biocatalyst recovery; disadvantages that can be minimized by its immobilization. Here, a recyclable bio&#8208;composed system was constructed by in&#8208;situ encapsulation under mild conditions using formate dehydrogenase in a ZIF&#8208;8 metalorganic framework (MOF) in the presence of magnetite. The partial dissolution of ZIF&#8208;8 in the enzyme's operation medium can be relatively inhibited if the concentration of magnetic support used exceeds 10&#8197;mg&#8201;mL&#8722;1. The bio&#8208;friendly environment for immobilization does not harm the integrity of the biocatalyst, and the production of formic acid is improved 3.4&#8208;fold compared to the free enzyme because the MOFs act as concentrators of the enzymatic cofactor. Furthermore, the bio&#8208;composed system retains 86&#8201;% of its activity after a long time of five cycles, thus indicating an excellent magnetic recovery and a good reusability.

         <title>Temporal Control of Fluorescent EuW10 Aggregates For Autonomous DNA Capture and Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly exploits noncovalent interaction to offer a facile and effective method for the fabrication of materials. For Na9[EuW10O36]&#183;32H2O (EuW10), the negative charges and abundant oxygen atoms on its surface provide a handle for static self&#8208;assembly. New properties are envisioned for EuW10 aggregates which are able to display such kinetics and time&#8208;programming characteristics, in order to satisfy more complex and intelligent application scenarios, such as DNA binding and information encryption. In this work, EuW10 coupling with stimuli&#8208;responsive dodecyl dimethylamine oxide (C12DMAO) can generate versatile aggregates with pH&#8208;responsive properties. We demonstrated the temporal programming of the assembly and disassembly of EuW10 nanospheres using a pH clock reaction of acid/urease hydrolysis. The pH clock reaction endows EuW10 assemblies with dynamical properties, in which the charges and fluorescence changes are coded in this system. These fluorescent assemblies provide new application in time&#8208;programmed DNA capture and information encryption.</dc:description>

         <title>A tetradentate ligand enables iron&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of ketones in a CO&#8208; or isocyanide&#8208;free fashion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein reported the design and synthesis of a ferrocene&#8208;based tetradentate ligand that is featured with modular synthesis and rigid skeleton. Its iron(II) complex facilitates asymmetric hydrogenation of ketones without the participation of extra strong&#8208;field ligand such as CO and isocyanide. Hydride donor LAH converted non&#8208;reactive Fe(II) species to reactive Fe(II) hydride species. With this catalyst, various chiral alcohols including the intermediate for montelukast could be prepared with satisfactory yields and enantioinduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Bridging the gap between zeolites and dense silica polymorphs: Formation of all&#8208;silica zeolite with high framework density from natural layered silicate magadiite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A silica zeolite (RWZ&#8208;1) with a very high framework density (FD) was synthesized from highly crystalline natural layered silicate magadiite, bridging the gap between the two research areas of zeolites and dense silica polymorphs. Magadiite was topotactically converted into a 3D framework through two&#8208;step heat treatment. The resulting structure had a 1D micropore system of channel&#8208;like cavities with an FD of 22.1 Si atoms/1000 &#197;3. This value is higher than those of all other silica zeolites reported so far, approaching those of silica polymorphs (tridymite (22.6) and &#945;&#8208;quartz (26.5)). RWZ&#8208;1 is a slight negative thermal expansion material with thermal properties approaching those of dense silica polymorphs. It contributes to the creation of a new field on microporous high&#8208;density silica/silicates. Synergistic interactions are expected between the micropores with molecular sieving properties and the dense layer&#8208;like building units with different topologies which provide thermal and mechanical stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Amination of Alcohols Using Diazo Compounds under Manganese Catalysis Through Hydrogenative N&#8208;Alkylation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sustainable chemical production requires fundamentally new types of catalysts and catalytic technologies. The development of coherent and robust catalytic systems based on earth&#8208;abundant transition metals is essential, but highly challenging. Herein, we systematically explored a general hydrogenative cleavage/N&#8208;alkylation tandem of cyclic and acyclic diazo (N=N) compounds to value&#8208;added amines under manganese catalysis. The reaction is catalyzed by a single&#8208;site molecular manganese complex and proceeds via tandem dehydrogenation, transfer hydrogenation, and borrowing hydrogenation strategies. Interestingly, the reaction involves abundantly available renewable feedstocks, such as alcohols, that can act as (transfer)hydrogenating and alkylating agents. The synthetic application of our approach in large&#8208;scale pharmaceutical synthesis and easy access to highly demanding N&#8208;CH3/CD3 derivatives are also demonstrated. Kinetic studies show that the reaction rate depends on the concentration of alcohol and Mn&#8208;catalyst and follows fractional orders. Several selective bond activation/formation reactions occur sequentially via amine&#8211;amide metal&#8208;ligand cooperation.</dc:description>

         <title>Disulfide&#8208;driven Pore Functionalization of Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) imparts additional functionality to metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) that is often difficult to access using solvothermal synthesis. As such, expanding the repertory of PSM reactions available to the practitioner is of increased importance for the generation of materials tailored for desired applications. Herein, we describe a method for the protecting group&#8208;free installation of diverse functional groups within the pores of a MIL&#8208;53(Al) analogue via disulfide bond formation. The majority of the reactions proceed with thiol&#8208;to&#8208;disulfide conversions ranging from high to nearly quantitative. The disulfide bonds are stable in various solvents and can be cleaved in the presence of a reducing agent.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Rubicene&#8208;Based Aromatic &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Compounds as Five&#8208;Membered Ring Embedded Planar Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic compounds having two and three rubicene substructures were synthesized by the Scholl reactions of oligoarene precursors. These nanographene&#8208;like compounds have planar aromatic frameworks, and its length along the long axis reaches 2.8&#8197;nm for the trimer. These compounds showed characteristic absorption and fluorescence bands in the long&#8208;wavelength region owing to small HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps by effective &#960;&#8208;conjugation.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons consisting of two or three rubicene substructures were designed as &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds embedding five&#8208;membered rings. The target compounds with t&#8208;butyl groups were synthesized by the Scholl reaction of precursors consisting of 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene units, even though a partially precyclized precursor was required for the synthesis of the trimer. These compounds were isolated as stable and dark blue solids. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis and DFT calculations revealed the planar aromatic framework of these compounds. In the electronic spectra, the absorption and emission bands were considerably red&#8208;shifted compared with those of the reference rubicene compound. In particular, the emission band of the trimer extended to the near&#8208;IR region while retaining the emissive property. The narrowed HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap with the extension of the &#960;&#8208;conjugation was confirmed by cyclic voltammetry and DFT calculations.

         <title>Light&#8208;Promoted Basic Nitrogen Unmasking in Arene Ruthenium Complexes Derived from Z&#8208;Configured 2,2&#8242;&#8208;Azobispyridine</title>

Traceless release: A series of E and Z isomeric forms of arene RuII complexes bearing ligands derived from 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobispyridine is disclosed. The stability of the uncommon Z&#8208;configured complexes exhibiting 7&#8208;membered chelate ring involving two pyridines allows single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction study to be reported here for the first time. Upon action of light, irreversible Z&#8594;E isomerization with rearrangement of the coordination pattern occurs, thereby unmasking a basic nitrogen atom.







Abstract
Two novel 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobispyridine derivatives bearing N&#8208;dialkylamino substituents at position 4,4&#8242; were synthesized and their E&#8211;Z photoswitching behavior was characterized by combination of 1H&#8208; and 13C&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, UV&#8211;Vis absorption and DFT calculations. Both isomers act as ligands towards arene&#8208;RuII centers, leading either to E&#8208;configured 5&#8208;membered chelates (involving coordination of nitrogen atoms from N=N bond and pyridine) or to the uncommon Z&#8208;configured 7&#8208;membered chelates (involving coordination of nitrogen atoms from both pyridines). The latter show good stability in the dark, allowing single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction study to be reported here for the first time. All synthesized Z&#8208;configured arene&#8208;RuII complexes undergo irreversible photo&#8208;isomerization to their corresponding E isomers with rearrangement of their coordination pattern. This property was advantageously exploited for the light&#8208;promoted unmasking of a basic nitrogen atom of the ligand.

         <title>Easily Accessible Substituted Heterocyclic Hemithioindigos as Bistable Molecular Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterocyclic hemithioindigo chromophores are easily accessible from the condensation of aldehydes and thioindoxyl derivatives. Using electron&#8208;rich heterocycles leads to excellent photoswitching properties such as strong absorption in visible light, good absorption changes between two isomers, quantitative isomer interconversions in both directions and high thermal stability.







Abstract
Thioaurone chromophores, part of the indigoid family and commonly named hemithioindigos, have recently gained attention due to their interesting photoswitching properties. The study focuses on heterocyclic hemithioindigos (Het&#8208;HTIs) and investigates their synthesis using electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor heterocycles and modifications to the thioindigo moiety. Furthermore, it aims to evaluate the photoswitching performances of these synthesised compounds, with a particular emphasis on the influence of the heterocycles on the photoisomerization capabilities, which was found to be more prominent than the modifications made to the thioindigo moiety. Among the 44 Het&#8208;HTIs tested, several exhibited highly efficient photoswitchable properties, demonstrating Z&#8208;to&#8208;E photoisomerization in the blue region, and E&#8208;to&#8208;Z photoisomerization in the green or the red regions. Additionally, the metastable E&#8208;isomer displayed an impressive half&#8208;life of up to 54&#8197;days in a polar solvent (DMSO). These results suggest that heterocyclic hemithioindigos hold great promise as photoswitches for researchers interested in light&#8208;controlled molecular mechanisms.

This study presents the synthesis, the spectroscopic and electrochemical properties of new bis&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted azaboron&#8208;dipyrromethene (aza&#8208;BODIPY) dyes substituted by different electron donating groups connected to the aza&#8208;BODIPY core through a thiophene unit. In line with theoretical calculations, experimental measurements point out the positive impact of the thiophene group that behave as a secondary donor group leading to an enhancement of the intramolecular charge transfer process in comparison to previously reported aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes. This heterocycle has also been found to tune the oxidative potential and to stabilize the electro&#8208;generated species.

         <title>Double Dynamic Structural Change Enabling Tricolor Chromism by the Realization of Apparent Two&#8208;Electron Transfer to Skip the Open&#8208;Shell State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tricolor electrochromic systems were constructed by realizing a double dynamic structural change that facilitates an apparent 2e&#8208;transfer in both oxidation and reduction processes. Therefore, redox interconversion cleanly proceeds among neutral (zigzag), dicationic (L&#8208;shape), and tetracationic (planar) states, accompanied by a drastic change in color and near infrared (NIR)&#8208;absorption.







Abstract
Most redox systems generally cannot avoid the involvement of open&#8208;shell species upon generating multiply charged species, which often reduces reversibility in multi&#8208;color electrochromic systems. In this study, we newly synthesized octakis(aminophenyl)&#8208;substituted pentacenebisquinodimethane (BQD) derivatives and their hybrids with alkoxyphenyl analogues. Thanks to apparent two&#8208;electron transfer accompanied by double dramatic changes in the structure of the arylated quinodimethane skeleton, the dicationic and tetracationic states were generated and isolated quantitatively because of the negligible steady&#8208;state concentration of intermediary open&#8208;shell species such as monocation or trication radicals. When two electrophores with different donating abilities are attached to the BQD skeleton, a dicationic state with a different color can be isolated in addition to the neutral and tetracationic states. For these tetracations, an interchromophore interaction induces a red&#8208;shift of the NIR absorptions, thus realizing tricolor UV/Vis/NIR electrochromic behavior involving only closed&#8208;shell states.

         <title>Rapid Access to Encapsulated Molecular Rotors via Coordination&#8208;Driven Macrocycle Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal coordination to a pyridine&#8208;based arylene ethynylene provides an expedient pathway to encapsulated molecular rotors or turnstiles. With the modularity of the synthetic design, this strategy provides access to a wide variety of encapsulated turnstile&#8208;type structures. X&#8208;ray crystallography, solution 1H&#8197;NMR, and solid&#8208;state 13C&#8197;NMR provide insight into the potential for rotation of the central unit.







Abstract
Macrocycle formation that relies upon trans metal coordination of appropriately placed pyridine ligands within an arylene ethynylene construct provides rapid and reliable access to molecular rotators encapsulated within macrocyclic stators. Showing no significant close contacts to the central rotators, X&#8208;ray crystallography of AgI&#8208;coordinated macrocycles provides plausibility for unobstructed rotation or wobbling of rotators within the central cavity. Solid&#8208;state 13C&#8197;NMR of PdII&#8208;coordinated macrocycles supports the notion of unobstructed movement of simple arenes in the crystal lattice. Solution 1H NMR studies indicate complete and immediate macrocycle formation upon the introduction of PdII to the pyridyl&#8208;based ligand at room temperature. Moreover, the formed macrocycle is stable in solution; a lack of significant changes in the 1H NMR spectrum upon cooling to &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C is consistent with the absence of dynamic behavior. The synthetic route to these macrocycles is expedient and modular, providing access to rather complex constructs in four simple steps involving Sonogashira coupling and deprotection reactions.

&#8220;Sandwich&#8221; diimine&#8208;copper (I) complex catalyzes reactions of CF3CHN2 and CF3CF2CHN2 reagents with C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in a large panel of alkyl esters, halides, and protected amines resulting in introduction of trifluoroethyl&#8208; and pentafluoropropyl groups with predictable regioselectivities. Identical C&#8722;H functionalization conditions and stoichiometries are employed for generality and synthetic convenience. Preliminary mechanistic studies point to a mechanism involving a pre&#8208;equilibrium forming a &#8220;sandwich&#8221;&#8208;diimine copper&#8208;CF3CHN2 complex followed by rate&#8208;determining loss of nitrogen affording the reactive copper carbene which reacts with trifluoromethyldiazomethane about 6.5&#8197;times faster than with 1&#8208;fluoroadamantane explaining the need for slow addition of the diazo compound.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Construction of Si&#8722;O&#8722;C bond has been the monopoly of precious, rare, late transition metal catalysts. Reported here is a molecularly defined iron complex that catalyzes alkoxylation, dehydrogenative polymerization and tandem hydrosilylative&#8208;alkoxylation with only H2 as the byproduct. The iron catalyst tolerates an array of alcohols, silanes and produces Si&#8722;O coupled product under mild conditions with excellent yield.







Abstract
Alkoxylation, hydrosilylative&#8208;alkoxylation, and dehydrogenative&#8208;polymerization are some of the most widely used transformations in synthetic chemistry. However, these transformations are traditionally catalyzed by precious, and rare late&#8208;transition metals. Presented here is a molecularly defined iron complex that catalyzes alkoxylation, tandem hydrosilylative&#8208;alkoxylation, and dehydrogenative polymerization of silanes under mild conditions. The iron complex [Fe(CO)4(H)(SiPh3)] 1 catalyzes a direct Si&#8722;O coupling reaction between an array of silanes and alcohols to produce desired alkoxysilanes in excellent yield, with H2 as the only byproduct. The iron catalyst tolerates various functional groups and provides access to 20 alkoxysilanes, including essential molecules such as &#946;&#8208;citronellol and cholesterol. Further, complex 1 catalyzes the polymerization of renewable diol and silane monomer to produce a renewable and degradable poly(isosorbide&#8722;silyl ether). Remarkably, complex 1 catalyzes a tandem hydrosilylative&#8208;alkoxylation of alkynes under mild conditions to yield unsaturated silyl ethers. The synthetic utility has been demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale alkoxylation and hydrosilylative&#8208;alkoxylation reactions.

         <title>Germylenes Exhibiting Solid&#8208;State Emissions that Extend to NIR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;valent main group compounds that fluoresce in the solid&#8208;state were previously unknown. To address this, we investigated room&#8208;temperature photoluminescence from a series of crystals of germylenes 3&#8208;8 in this article; they exhibited emissions nearly reaching the NIR. Germylene carboxylates (3&#8208;8) were synthesized by reacting dipyrromethene&#8208;stabilized germylene pyrrolide (2) with carboxylic acids such as acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, benzoic acid, p&#8208;cyanobenzoic acid, p&#8208;nitrobenzoic acid, and acetylsalicylic acid.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of hierarchical CdS/NiS photocatalysts using Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 as template for efficient ethanol conversion and hydrogen production under visible light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conversion of ethanol into high&#8208;valuable chemicals and H2 by photocatalytic process provides a sustainable approach to produce carbon&#8208;chain&#8208;prolonged chemicals and hydrogen energy. In this article, Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 was added to fabricate the hierarchical CdS/NiS&#8208;N composites with an elevated specific surface area during the hydrothermal synthesis of CdS microsphere, and the Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 facilitate the self&#8208;assemble growth of CdS and provide a source of Ni for the formation of NiS. The as&#8208;prepared photocatalyst was subjected to photocatalytic ethanol conversion, and the hierarchical composite material CdS/NiS&#8208;N (100) formed by adding 100mg of Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity and stability in an ethanol aqueous solution with a water content of 10%. Under visible light irradiation, the conversion rate of ethanol reached 15.2% at the photocatalytic reaction of 5h. The selectivity of 2,3&#8208;butanediol(2,3&#8208;BDO) was 25%, and the selectivity of acetaldehyde(AA) was 63%. Through various characterizations, it has been proven that a large specific surface area and the coupling interface between CdS and NiS are key factors in improving photocatalytic performance. This work provides an effective strategy for constructing photocatalysts with coupled cocatalysts/semiconductors and large specific surface areas.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoswitchable Azoheteroarene&#8208;Based Chelating Ligands: Light Modulation of Properties, Aqueous Solubility and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the design and synthesis of eight photoswitchable phenylazopyridine&#8208; and phenylazopyrazole&#8208;based molecular systems as light&#8208;controllable chelation&#8208;type ligands. Besides the studies on fundamental photoisomerization behaviour, the ligands were also screened for light&#8208;tuneable properties such as photochromism, phase transition, and solubility especially in the aqueous medium. This investigation demonstrates how the modulation of aqueous solubility can be achieved through photoisomerization and can further be utilized toward controlling the amount of catalytically active Cu(I) species in the homogeneous aqueous conditions. Through this approach, light control over the catalytic activity was achieved for Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reactions, along with a partial recovery of the catalytically active species.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation Behavior of Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based [3]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclodextrin (CD)&#8208;based [3]rotaxane formed aggregation structures under the appropriate conditions, as was clearly observed for the first time. Detailed study of this phenomenon revealed that [3]rotaxane aggregated with hexagonal packing owing to hydrogen bond formation among CD units, in a manner similar to polyrotaxane species. This aggregation could be controlled by solvent type upon dispersion, through the axle end structures, and by modification of CD. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Akae and P. Theato (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301582).

         <title>Cyclotrimerization Approach to Symmetric [9]Helical Indenofluorenes: Diverting Cyclization Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic cyclotrimerization (Rh, Co, and Ni catalysts) of triyne 1 gives rise preferentially to [9]helical indenofluorene, whereas it thermal cyclization gives rise to polyaromatic hydrocarbon 3. The former reaction proceeds via classical alkyne cyclotrimerization, the latter via dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction accompanied by unusual C&#8722;C cleavage. DFT calculations shed light on the course of the reaction.







Abstract
Catalytic cyclotrimerization routes to symmetrical [9]helical indenofluorene were explored by using different transition&#8211;metal complexes and thermal conditions. Depending on the reaction conditions, the cyclotrimerizations were accompanied by dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction giving rise to another type of aromatic compounds. Structures of both symmetrical [9]helical cyclotrimerization product as well as the dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder product were confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Limits of enantioselective cyclotrimerization were assessed as well. DFT calculations shed light on the reaction course and the origin of diminished enantioselectivity.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Helical Azaheptalene and Chiroptical Switching of an Isolable Radical Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a ballet studio, azaheptalene with M helicity is dancing in front of a mirror. The molecule reflected in the mirror shows a novel azaheptalene with opposite P helicity, and the large torsion angle is described by the dynamic jumping molecule. Its attractive and stimuli&#8208;responsive properties are expressed rhythmically. This cover implies that the azaheptalene is now ready to come under the big spotlight. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Ishigaki and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301759).

         <title>A Versatile Route to Acyl (MIDA)Boronates.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Highly Soluble Cyclic Organoalanes Based on Anionic Dicarbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbocyclic aluminium hydrides [(ADCAr)AlH2]2 are readily accessible as crystalline solids on treatment of anionic dicarbenes Li(ADCAr) with LiAlH4. Hydroalumination of CO2 (and other organic substrates) with [(ADCPh)AlH2]2 has been shown to access [(ADCPh)Al(OCH(O))2]2 (and other products).







Abstract
Cyclic organoalane compounds [(ADCAr)AlH2]2 (ADCAr = ArC{(DippN)C}2; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; Ar = Ph or 4&#8208;PhC6H4 (Bp)) based on anionic dicarbene (ADC) frameworks have been reported as crystalline solids. Treatments of Li(ADCAr) with LiAlH4 at room temperature afford [(ADCAr)AlH2]2 with the concomitant release of LiH. Compounds [(ADCAr)AlH2]2 are stable crystalline solids and are freely soluble in common organic solvents. They are annulated tricyclic compounds with an almost planar central C4Al2&#8208;core embedded between two peripheral 1,3&#8208;imidazole (C3N2) rings. At room temperature, [(ADCPh)AlH2]2 readily reacts with CO2 to form two&#8208; and four&#8208;fold hydroalumination products [(ADCPh)AlH(OCHO)]2 and [(ADCPh)Al(OCHO)2]2, respectively. Further hydroalumination reactivity of [(ADCPh)AlH2]2 has been shown with isocyanate (RNCO) and isothiocyanate (RNCS) species (R=alkyl or aryl group). All compounds have been characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>The Unified Redox Scale for All Solvents: Consistency and Gibbs Transfer Energies of Electrolytes from their Constituent Single Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Consistent: The unified redox scale 
 is valid for all solvents. Still, the existence of their widely used constituents, the single ion properties &#8211; redox potential or pH value &#8211; are disputed. Yet, the sum of the single ion Gibbs transfer energy of electroactive cation and anion must equal the Gibbs transfer energy of the constituting salt, which is measurable without any assumption. With the recently proposed &#8216;ideal&#8217; ILSB&#8208;method to determine Gibbs transfer energies of single ions, we now show that this condition is fulfilled. Hence, our simple electrochemical method yields consistent single&#8208;ion magnitudes proving the validity of the assembled unified redox scale.







Abstract
We have devised the unified redox scale EabsH2O, which is valid for all solvents. The necessary single ion Gibbs transfer energy between two different solvents, which only can be determined with extra&#8208;thermodynamic assumptions so far, must clearly satisfy two essential conditions: First, the sum of the independent cation and anion values must give the Gibbs transfer energy of the salt they form. The latter is an observable and measurable without extra&#8208;thermodynamic assumptions. Second, the values must be consistent for different solvent combinations. With this work, potentiometric measurements on silver ions and on chloride ions show that both conditions are fulfilled using a salt bridge filled with the ionic liquid [N2225][NTf2]: if compared to the values resulting from known pKL values, the silver and chloride single ion magnitudes combine within a uncertainty of 1.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 to the directly measurable transfer magnitudes of the salt AgCl from water to the solvents acetonitrile, propylene carbonate, dimethylformamide, ethanol, and methanol. The resulting values are used to further develop the consistent unified redox potential scale EabsH2O that now allows to assess and compare redox potentials in and over six different solvents. We elaborate on its implications.

         <title>Free Ethynylarsinidene and Ethynylstibinidene: Heavier Analogues of Nitrenes and Phosphinidenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triplet ethynylarsinidene (HCCAs) and ethynylstibinidene (HCCSb) were generated photochemically in argon matrices from their corresponding pnictines. Electronic structures of these species are compared with HCCN and HCCP in light of their vibrational and electronic spectra and with support from theory.







Abstract
Until now, there has been very little experimental evidence for the existence of free arsinidenes and stibinidenes, apart from the hydrides, AsH and SbH. Here, we report on photogeneration of triplet ethynylarsinidene, HCCAs, and triplet ethynylstibinidene, HCCSb, from ethynylarsine and ethynylstibine, respectively, in solid argon matrices. The products were identified using infrared spectroscopy and the associated UV absorption spectra are interpreted with the aid of theoretical predictions.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Characterization of Palladium&#8208;Functionalized Covalent Organic Framework and Its Application as Heterogeneous Catalysis for C&#8722;H Arylation of Azoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;functionalized covalent organic framework with high thermal and chemical stabilities has been prepared and used as heterogeneous ligand to immobilize PdII. The resulting Pd&#8208;bound COF was found to be an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the C&#8722;H arylation of azoles and aryl halides with high recyclability.







Abstract
A novel triazine&#8208;based covalent organic framework (TFPT&#8208;Bz COF) has been constructed by the condensation of 2,4,6&#8208;tris(5&#8208;formyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinoxy)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TFPT) and benzidine (BZ) with deep eutectic solvent (DES) as the reaction medium. After the introduction of Pd ions through strong coordination to TFPT&#8208;Bz COF matrix, the constructed TFPT&#8208;Bz COF/Pd composite exhibited excellent catalytic activity for C&#8722;H arylation of azoles with aryl halides in 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran. The protocol allows the arylation of a variety of substituted azoles with diverse aryl halides in high to excellent yield. Moreover, the TFPT&#8208;Bz COF/Pd catalyst can be recycled several times without significantly reducing its activity.

         <title>Corrosion Engineering towards NiFe&#8208;Layered Double Hydroxide Macroporous Arrays with Enhanced Activity and Stability for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiFe&#8208;LDH macroporous arrays are prepared by a controllable corrosion strategy. The unique macroporous array not only increases the active area, but also creates a stable nanostructure. The catalysts only need 180&#8197;mV and 248&#8197;mV to reach 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for OER, respectively, and remain highly stable for 1000&#8197;h at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
NiFe&#8208;layered double hydroxide (NiFe&#8208;LDH) is the benchmark catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium, however, it is still challenging to improve its activity and stability. Herein, NiFe&#8208;LDH macroporous array electrodes are demonstrated to significantly enhance the activity and stability for oxygen evolution reaction. The electrodes are fabricated by the chemical and electrochemical corrosion process of Ni foam induced by ferric nitrate, hydrochloric acid and oxygen. By optimizing the amount of iron salt and acid and selecting the appropriate reaction temperature and time, the NiFe&#8208;LDH electrodes only need the overpotential of 180&#8197;mV and 248&#8197;mV to reach the current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, and remain highly stable for 1000&#8197;h at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The unique macroporous array not only significantly increases the active area of NiFe&#8208;LDH catalyst, but also creates a stable nanostructure that avoids severe reconstruction.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Derived Cu&#8722;Ag Interface for Selective Carbon Monoxide Electroreduction to Acetate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag&#8208;modified CuMOF&#8208;74 (Ag0.10@CuMOF&#8208;74) has been synthesized for highly selective CO electroreduction with Faradaic efficiency for C2+ products up to 90.4&#8201;% and an acetate Faradaic efficiency of 61.1&#8201;%. The introduction of Ag to CuMOF&#8208;74 is beneficial to create abundant excellent Cu&#8722;Ag interface sites, in which the adsorption of key intermediates is optimized and the C&#8722;C coupling is promoted, thus favoring the formation of acetate.







Abstract
Electrochemical carbon monoxide reduction reaction (CORR) is a potential way to obtain high&#8208;value multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products. However, achieving high selectivity to acetate is still a challenge. Herein, we develop a two&#8208;dimensional Ag&#8208;modified Cu metal&#8211;organic framework (Ag0.10@CuMOF&#8208;74) that demonstrates Faradaic efficiency (FE) for C2+ products up to 90.4&#8201;% at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an acetate FE of 61.1&#8201;% with a partial current density of 122.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Detailed investigations show that the introduction of Ag on CuMOF&#8208;74 favors the generation of abundant Cu&#8722;Ag interface sites. In situ attenuated total reflection surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy confirms that these Cu&#8722;Ag interface sites improve the coverage of *CO and *CHO and the coupling between each other and stabilize key intermediates *OCCHO and *OCCH2, thus significantly promoting to the acetate selectivity on Ag0.10@CuMOF&#8208;74. This work provides a high&#8208;efficiency pathway for CORR to C2+ products.

         <dc:description>
The cover illustrates that the monoselective deuteration of diiodomethane mediated by lithium carbenoid is enabled by a flow microreactor. The monodeuterated diiodomethane obtained was used for the protection of catechols and Matteson&#8208;type homologation to generate single deuterium&#8208;labelled molecules. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Nagaki and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301738).

         <dc:description>Irreversible two&#8208;photon photorearrangement of 1,2&#8208;diarylethenes is a unique process providing access to complex 2a1,5a&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dithiaacenaphthylene (DDA) heterocyclic core. This reaction was serendipitously discovered during studies on photoswitchable diarylethenes and was initially considered as a highly undesired process. However, in recent years, it has been recognized as an efficient photochemical reaction, interesting by itself and as a promising synthetic method for the synthesis of challenging molecules. Herein, we discuss the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in studies on this notable process.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering to Boost the Photo&#8208;oxidase Activity of Molecular Rotors in Colorimetric Sensing of Temperatures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Some organic dyes and photosensitizers with strong visible absorption can behave as photo&#8208;responsive oxidase mimics. However, the relationship between the photo&#8208;oxidase activity and molecular structure remains unclear to date. In this work, a new type of photosensitizer with the characteristics of molecular rotors, namely DPPy, served as the molecular scaffold for further investigation. To adjust the photocatalytic oxidation ability, DAPy and CBPy were designed and synthesized based on the enhancement and diminishment of the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process, respectively. Kinetic studies revealed that DAPy and CBPy both exhibited highly efficient photo&#8208;activated oxidase&#8208;like activity with 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) as the substrate, which were in good accordance with their molecular engineering to promote either type I or type II reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Impressively a colorimetric method based on the visible light induced oxidase&#8208;like activity of molecular rotors was developed to determine the environmental temperature for the first time. Both DAPy and CBPy showed distinct sensitivities toward temperature as compared with several molecular rotors based on the typical fluorimetric detection. This work provides a new strategy for the application of molecular rotors to overcome the non&#8208;emissive challenge in temperature sensing.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide Macrocyclization Guided by Reversible Covalent Templating</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The creation of complementary products via templating is a hallmark feature of nucleic acid replication. Outside of nucleic acid&#8208;like molecules, the templated synthesis of a hetero&#8208;complementary copy is still rare. Herein we describe one cycle of templated synthesis that creates homomeric macrocyclic peptides guided by linear instructing strands. This strategy utilizes hydrazone formation to pre&#8208;organize peptide oligomeric monomers along the template on a solid support resin, and microwave&#8208;assisted peptide synthesis to couple monomers and cyclize the strands. &#160;With a flexible templating strand, we can alter the size of the complementary macrocycle products by increasing the length and number of the binding peptide oligomers, showing the potential to precisely tune the size of macrocyclic products. For the smaller macrocyclic peptides, the products can be released via hydrolysis and characterized by ESI&#8208;MS.</dc:description>

         <title>The Factor beyond Schmidt's Criteria Impacting the Photo&#8208;Induced [2+2] Cycloaddition Reactivity and Photoactuation of Molecular Crystals Based on Cyclic Chalcone Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond Schmidt's criteria, the restricted mobility of the C=C bond affects the solid&#8208;state photo&#8208;induced [2+2] cycloaddition reactivity, facilitating the development of photomechanical molecular crystalline materials.







Abstract
Generally, the potential reactive &#8220;olefin pairs&#8221; in the molecular crystals satisfying Schmidt's criteria could undergo topological [2+2] cycloaddition. In this study, another factor that affects the photodimerization reactivity of chalcone analogues was found. The cyclic chalcone analogues of (E)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;dichlorobenzylidene)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;inden&#8208;1&#8208;one (BIO), (E)&#8208;2&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethylene)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;inden&#8208;1&#8208;one (NIO), (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;dichlorobenzylidene)benzofuran&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;one (BFO), and (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;dichlorobenzylidene)benzo[b]thiophen&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;one (BTO) have been synthesized. While the geometrical parameters for the molecular packing of the above four compounds did not exceed Schmidt's criteria, [2+2] cycloaddition did not occur in the crystals of BIO and BTO. The single crystal structures and Hirshfeld surface analyses revealed that interactions of C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H (CH2) existed between adjacent molecules in the crystal of BIO. Therefore, the carbonyl and methylene groups linked with one carbon atom in carbon&#8208;carbon double bond were tightly confined in the lattice, acting as a tweezer to inhibit free movement of the double bond and suppressing [2+2] cycloaddition. In the crystal of BTO, similar interactions of Cl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S and C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H (C6H4) prevented free movement of the double bond. In contrast, the intermolecular interaction of C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H only exists around the carbonyl group in the crystals of BFO and NIO, leaving the C=C double bonds to move freely and allowing the occurrence of [2+2] cycloaddition. Driven by photodimerization, the needle&#8208;like crystals of BFO and NIO displayed evident photo&#8208;induced bending behavior. This work demonstrates that the intermolecular interactions around carbon&#8208;carbon double bond affect the [2+2] cycloaddition reactivity except for Schmidt's criteria. These findings provide valuable insights into the design of photomechanical molecular crystalline materials.

         <title>Structure Formation in an Ionic Liquid Wetting Layer: A Combined STM, IRAS, DFT and MD Study of [C2C1Im][OTf] on Au(111)</title>

Abstract
In a solid catalyst with ionic liquid layer (SCILL), ionic liquid (IL) coatings are used to improve the selectivity of noble metal catalysts. To understand the origins of this selectivity control, we performed model studies by surface science methods in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV). We investigated the growth and thermal stability of ultrathin IL films by infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS). We combined these experiments with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to obtain information on the orientation of the ions, the interactions with the surface, the intermolecular interactions, and the structure formation. Additionally, we performed DFT calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to interpret the experimental data. We studied the IL 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate [C2C1Im][OTf] on Au(111) surfaces. We observe a weakly bound multilayer of [C2C1Im][OTf], which is stable up to 390&#8197;K, while the monolayer desorbs at &#8764;450&#8197;K. [C2C1Im][OTf] preferentially adsorbs at the step edges and elbows of the herringbone reconstruction of Au(111). The anion adsorbs via the SO3 group with the molecular axis perpendicular to the surface. At low coverage, the [C2C1Im][OTf] crystallizes in a glass&#8208;like 2D phase with short&#8208;range order. At higher coverage, we observe a phase transition to a 6&#8208;membered ring structure with long&#8208;range order.

         <title>Chemodivergent Tandem Radical Cyclization of Alkene&#8208;Substituted Quinazolinones: Rapid Access to Mono&#8208; and Di&#8208;Alkylated Ring&#8208;Fused Quinazolinones</title>

A novel method for preparing mono&#8208; and di&#8208;alkylated ring&#8208;fused quinazolinones from alkene&#8208;substituted quinazolinones via chemodivergent tandem radical cyclization under metal&#8208; and base&#8208;free conditions has been established.







Abstract
Chemodivergent tandem radical cyclization offers exciting possibilities for the synthesis of structurally diverse cyclic compounds. Herein, we revealed a chemodivergent tandem cyclization of alkene&#8208;substituted quinazolinones under metal&#8208; and base&#8208;free conditions, this transformation is initiated by alkyl radicals produced from oxidant&#8208;induced &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of alkyl nitriles or esters. The reaction resulted in the selective synthesis of a series of mono&#8208; and di&#8208;alkylated ring&#8208;fused quinazolinones by modulating the loading of oxidant, reaction temperature, and reaction time. Mechanistic investigations show that the mono&#8208;alkylated ring&#8208;fused quinazolinones is constructed by the key process of 1,2&#8208;hydrogen shift, whereas the di&#8208;alkylated ring&#8208;fused quinazolinones is mainly achieved through crucial steps of resonance and proton transfer. This protocol is the first example of remote second alkylation on the aromatic ring via &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization and difunctionalization achieved by association of two unsaturated bonds in radical cyclization.

The first case of successful suppression of the coordination of a lithium atom with a dialkylamino group by the effective conjugation of the latter with the aromatic core has been discovered on the example of the bromine&#8722;lithium exchange in 4,6,7,9&#8208;tetrabromo&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;perimidine. Experimental results are explained by means of quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
The first case of successful suppression of the coordination of a lithium atom with a dialkylamino group by the effective conjugation of the latter with the aromatic core has been discovered. This effect controls regioselectivity of the bromine&#8722;lithium exchange in 4,6,7,9&#8208;tetrabromo&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;perimidine, which leads to products with the most effective conjugation. As a result, the product of this quadruple exchange demonstrates no tendency of the coordination of the NMe groups to neighboring lithium atoms despite the absence of steric restrictions. Experimental results are explained by means of quantum chemical calculations: geometry optimization, natural bond analysis and scans using the modredundant scheme.

         <title>Piezochromism and Conductivity Modulations under High Pressure by Manipulating the Viologen Radical Concentration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manipulating the radical concentration to modulate the properties is an attractive topic. In this work, the cross&#8208;conjugated 2&#8208;X all exhibit much higher radical concentrations with more sensitive piezochromism after compression. Unexpectedly, the electrical resistance of linear&#8208;conjugated 1&#8208;NO3 decreased remarkably with the increasing pressure, while that in 2&#8208;NO3 remained almost unchanged. Such unusual invariant conductivity breaks the conventional wisdom that radical generation is beneficial to improve conductivity.







Abstract
Manipulating the radical concentration to modulate the properties in solid multifunctional materials is an attractive topic in various frontier fields. Viologens have the unique redox capability to generate radical states through reversible electron transfer (ET) under external stimuli. Herein, taking the viologens as the model, two kinds of crystalline compounds with different molecule&#8208;conjugated systems were designed and synthesized. By subjecting the specific model viologens to pressure, the cross&#8208;conjugated 2&#8208;X all exhibit much higher radical concentrations, along with more sensitive piezochromic behaviors, compared to the linear&#8208;conjugated 1&#8208;X. Unexpectedly, we find that the electrical resistance (R) of 1&#8208;NO3 decreased by three orders of magnitude with the increasing pressure, while that in high&#8208;radical&#8208;concentration 2&#8208;NO3 remained almost unchanged. To date, such unusual invariant conductivity has not been documented in molecular&#8208;based materials under high pressure, breaking the conventional wisdom that the generations of radicals are beneficial to improve conductivity. We highlight that adjusting the molecular conjugation modes can be used as an effective way to regulate the radical concentrations and thus modulate properties rationally.

         <title>Five Novel Silver&#8208;Based Coordination Polymers as Photoluminescent Sensing Platforms for the Detection of Nitrobenzene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag10hpbt, Ag12bpva and Ag12bpb exemplify the first luminescent silver cluster&#8208;based coordination polymers used in the sensing of nitrobenzene through fluorescence quenching.







Abstract
Nitrobenzene (NB) is a highly toxic chemical and a cause for concern to human health and the environment. Hence, it is worth designing new efficient and robust sensing platforms for NB. In this study, we present three newly synthesized luminescent silver cluster&#8208;based coordination polymers, {[Ag10(StBu)6(CF3COO)4(hpbt)] (DMAc)2(CH3CN)2}n (hpbt=N,N,N&#8217;,N'N&#8221;,N&#8221;&#8208;hexa(pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triamine), [Ag12(StBu)6(CF3COO)6(bpva)3]n (bpva=9,10&#8208;Bis(2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)vinyl)anthracene), and {[Ag12(StBu)6(CF3COO)6(bpb)(DMAc)2(H2O)2] (DMAc)2}n (bpb=1,4&#8208;Bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)benzene) composed of Ag10, Ag12 and Ag12 cluster cores, respectively, connected by multidentate pyridine linkers. In addition, two new luminescent polymorphic silver(I)&#8208;based coordination polymers, [Ag(CF3COO)(dpa)]n (dpa=9,10&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)anthracene) referred to as Agdpa (H) and Agdpa (R), where H and R denote hexagon&#8208; and rod&#8208;like crystal shapes, respectively, have been prepared. The coordination polymers exhibit highly sensitive luminescence quenching effects to NB, attributed to the &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking interactions between the polymers and NB as well as the electron&#8208;withdrawing character of NB.

         <title>Ultrasmall Gold Nanoparticles as Clients of Biomolecular Condensates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasmall gold nanoparticles concentrate and distribute into biomolecular condensates. The nanoparticles establish dynamic noncovalent interactions with the scaffold protein and act as clients. They may also favor or disfavor condensate formation. The nanoparticles could be used to explore biomolecular condensates in&#8197;vitro and in cellular models of pathology.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) of biopolymers to form condensates is a widespread phenomenon in living cells. Agents that target or alter condensation can help uncover elusive physiological and pathological mechanisms. Owing to their unique material properties and modes of interaction with biomolecules, nanoparticles represent attractive condensate&#8208;targeting agents.
Our work focused on elucidating the interaction between ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (usGNPs) and diverse types of condensates of tau, a representative phase&#8208;separating protein associated with neurodegenerative disorders. usGNPs attract considerable interest in the biomedical community due to unique features, including emergent optical properties and good cell penetration. We explored the interaction of usGNPs with reconstituted self&#8208;condensates of tau, two&#8208;component tau/polyanion and three&#8208;component tau/RNA/alpha&#8208;synuclein coacervates. The usGNPs were found to concentrate into condensed liquid droplets, consistent with the formation of dynamic client (nanoparticle) &#8208; scaffold (tau) interactions, and were observable thanks to their intrinsic luminescence. Furthermore, usGNPs were capable to promote LLPS of a protein domain which is unable to phase separate on its own.
Our study demonstrates the ability of usGNPs to interact with and illuminate protein condensates. We anticipate that nanoparticles will have broad applicability as nanotracers to interrogate phase separation, and as nanoactuators controlling the formation and dissolution of condensates.

         <title>Acidic Properties of Known and New COOH&#8208;Functionalized M(IV) Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two stable MOFs, Zr/Hf&#8722;CAU&#8208;61, were discovered in acetic acid as solvent by using pyromellitic acid (H4PMA). Structure refinement and full characterization were carried out and permanent porosity was confirmed. Acid&#8208;base properties were determined by titration with aqueous LiOH and compared with the acidic Zr&#8208;MOFs UiO&#8208;66&#8208;BDC, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;TMA and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;PMA. In addition, results of metal ion and dye permeation studies on Zr&#8722;CAU&#8208;61 membranes are presented.







Abstract
Herein, we report two new COOH&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) of composition [M6O4(OH)6(PMA)2(H2PMA)]&#215;H2O, M=Zr, Hf), denoted CAU&#8208;61, synthesized by using pyromellitic acid (H4PMA), a tetracarboxylic acid, as the linker and acetic acid as the solvent. The structure was determined from powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data and one&#8208;dimensional inorganic building units are connected through tetracarboxylate as well as dicarboxylate linker molecules, resulting in highly stable microporous framework structures with limiting and maximum pore diameter of &#8764;3.6 and &#8764;5.0&#8197;&#197;, respectively, lined with &#8722;COOH groups. Thermal stabilities of up to 400&#8201;&#176;C in air, chemical stability in water at pH&#8197;1 to 12 and water uptake of 17&#8197;mol/mol prompted us to study the proton exchange of the &#956;2&#8208;OH, &#956;3&#8208;OH of the IBU and &#8722;COOH groups of the linker by titration with LiOH. Comparison of the pKa values with three UiO&#8208;66 derivatives confirms distinct pKa value ranges and trends for the different acidic protons. Furthermore, the preparation of Zr&#8722;CAU&#8208;61 membranes and first results on permeation of dyes and ions in aqueous solutions are presented.

&lt;p&gt;Two stable MOFs, Zr/Hf&#8722;CAU-61, were discovered in acetic acid as solvent by using pyromellitic acid (H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PMA). Structure refinement and full characterization were carried out and permanent porosity was confirmed. Acid-base properties were determined by titration with aqueous LiOH and compared with the acidic Zr-MOFs UiO-66-BDC, UiO-66-TMA and UiO-66-PMA. In addition, results of metal ion and dye permeation studies on Zr&#8722;CAU-61 membranes are presented.

Abstract
Fluorescent probes based on photoinduced electron transfer (PET) quenching of long lifetime triangulenium fluorophores have found multiple applications. For such probes a successful design relies on the right balance between the rate of PET quenching and fluorescence. In a series of ADOTA (A) and DAOTA (D) triangulenium fluorophores appended with aniline&#8208;like quencher moieties, we have investigated the rate of quenching and its relation to thermodynamic driving force, distance, and conjugation within the quencher moiety. Three different quenchers, a short (1), a long (2), and a long twisted (3), 4&#8208;aminophenyl, 4&#8217;&#8208;aminobiphenyl, and 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8217;&#8208;aminobiphenyl, respectively were investigated. Steady&#8208;state spectroscopy and electrochemistry confirms that the quencher moieties are electronically decoupled from the dyes and have similar oxidation potentials and thus driving force for PET quenching, irrespectively of their different length and conjugation. Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence measurement was used to measure the fast PET quenching, with rate constant kPET ranging from &gt;4&#215;1011 to 2&#215;109&#8197;s&#8722;1. Interestingly, PET quenching is equally efficient/fast from 1 and 2, even with increase in distance between the donor and the acceptor. However, when twisting the biphenyl in 3, a 20&#8208;fold decrease in quenching is found. Even with this decrease in kPET, the quenching in 3&#8201;A/D is still highly efficient, with nearly 99&#8201;% quenching. The study show that long lifetime fluorophores can be efficiently switched even by relatively slow PET processes and that PET quencher moieties can be removed far from the fluorophore if conjugated linkers are applied.

         <title>CH3CN@open&#8208;C60: An Effective Inner&#8208;Space Modification and Isotope Effect Inside a Nano&#8208;Sized Flask</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polar CH3CN molecule has been encapsulated inside an open&#8208;cage C60 derivative under high pressure. The inserted CH3CN molecule has an impressive effect on the outer carbon cage, as shown by the enhanced polarity and decreased LUMO level. Crystallographic and computational analyses revealed that these changes were governed by the existence of the CH3CN and cage deformation caused by the insertion. Moreover, the favored binding affinity of CD3CN compared with CH3CN was affirmed. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Murata and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301161).

         <title>Structural Variations in Carboxylated Bispidine Ligands: Influence of Positional Isomerism and Rigidity on the Conformation, Stability, Inertness and Relaxivity of their Mn2+ Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mn2+ complexes of 2,4&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;disubstituted bispidine ligands have emerged as more biocompatible alternatives to Gd3+&#8208;based MRI probes. They display relaxivities comparable to that of commercial contrast agents and high kinetic inertness, unprecedented for Mn2+ complexes. The chemical structure, in particular the substituents on the two macrocyclic nitrogens N3 and N7, are decisive for the conformation of the Mn2+ complexes, and this will in turn determine their thermodynamic, kinetic and relaxation properties. We describe the synthesis of four ligands with acetate substituents in positions N3, N7 or both. We evidence that the bispidine conformation is dependent on N3 substitution, with direct impact on the thermodynamic stability, kinetic inertness, hydration state and relaxivity of the Mn2+ complexes. These results unambiguously show that (i) solely a chair&#8208;chair conformation allows for favorable inertness and relaxivity, and (ii) in this family such chair&#8208;chair conformation is accessible only for ligands without N3&#8208;appended carboxylates.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Luminescence from a Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter with Flexible Conformation of Ancillary Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Robust scaffolds were typically applied in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules to suppress the non&#8208;radiative decay, trigger the fast spin&#8208;flipping, and enhance the light out&#8208;coupling efficiency. Herein, we disclosed for the first time the positive effect of flexible conformation of ancillary groups on the photophysical properties of TADF emitter. The red TADF emitter Ph&#8208;TPA with flexible conformation demonstrated small excited&#8208;state structural distortion and low reorganization energy compared to the counterpart Mc&#8208;TPA with a rigid macrocycle. Consequently, Ph&#8208;TPA showed an excellent photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) of 92% and a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 30.6% at 630 nm. This work could deepen our understanding of structure&#8208;property relationships of organic luminophores and help us to rationalize the design of efficient TADF materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhibition of Amyloid &#946; Aggregation and Cytotoxicity by Berbamine Hydrochloride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to be a major global health challenge, and the recent approval of Aduhelm and Leqembi has opened new avenues for its treatment. Small&#8208;molecule inhibitors targeting A&#946; aggregation hold promise as an alternative to monoclonal antibodies. In this study, we evaluated the ability of berbamine hydrochloride (BBMH), a member of the bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids, to reduce A&#946; aggregation and cytotoxicity. Thioflavin T kinetics, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy results indicated that BBMH effectively inhibited A&#946; aggregation. Surface plasmon resonance and molecular docking results further revealed that BBMH could bind to A&#946; fibrils, thereby hindering the aggregation process. This physical picture has been confirmed in a quantitative way by chemical kinetics analysis, which showed BBMH tends to bind with the fibril ends and thus prevents the transition from protofibrils to mature fibrils as well as the elongation process. Additionally, our MTT results showed that BBMH was able to reduce the cytotoxicity of A&#946;40 on N2a cells. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, the potential of BBMH to inhibit A&#946; aggregation and cytotoxicity, offering a promising direction for further research and drug development efforts in the fight against Alzheimer's disease.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to be a major global health challenge, and the recent approval of Aduhelm and Leqembi has opened new avenues for its treatment. Small-molecule inhibitors targeting A&#946; aggregation hold promise as an alternative to monoclonal antibodies. In this study, we evaluated the ability of berbamine hydrochloride (BBMH), a member of the bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids, to reduce A&#946; aggregation and cytotoxicity. Thioflavin T kinetics, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy results indicated that BBMH effectively inhibited A&#946; aggregation.

         <dc:description>Symmetric and unsymmetric diaroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals can be readily accessed in consecutive syntheses in good to excellent yields by exploiting the inherent nucleophilic character of the methine position. Different aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals as well as acid chlorides yield a library of 19 diaroyl compounds with substitution and linker pattern&#8208;tunable emission properties, leading to a significant red&#8208;shift of emission in solid and aggregated state which were thoroughly investigated.

         <title>Naphthodithiophene&#8208;Fused Porphyrins: Synthesis, Characterization, and Impact of Extended Conjugation on Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fusion of tetrapyrroles with aromatic heterocycles constitutes a useful tool for manipulation of their opto&#8208;electronic properties. In this work, the synthesis of naphthodithiophene&#8208;fused porphyrins was achieved through a Heck reaction&#8208;based cascade reaction followed by a Scholl reaction. These naphthodithiophene&#8208;fused porphyrins display a unique set of optical and electronic properties. Fusion of the naphtho[2,1&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b']dithiophene to porphyrin (F2VTP) leads to an increase in the fluorescence lifetime by ~20%, which is accompanied, unexpectedly, by a more than 2&#8208;fold drop in the emission quantum yield (&#934;=0.018). In contrast, fusion of the isomeric naphtho[1,2&#8208;b:4,3&#8208;b']dithiophene to porphyrin (F3VPT) results in a ~1.5&#8208;fold increase in the fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;=0.13) with the concomitant ~30% increase in the fluorescence lifetime. This behaviour suggests that fusion of the porphyrin with the naphthodithiopheno&#8208;system affects mainly the radiative rate constant in the Q&#8208;state deactivation pathway, while the effects of the isomeric naphtho[2,1&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b']dithiophene&#8208; vs naphtho[1,2&#8208;b:4,3&#8208;b']dithiophene&#8208;fusion are essentially the opposite. Interestingly, NICS analysis revealed considerable difference between the aromaticity of these two isomericsystems. Our results demonstrate that subtle structural differences in the fused components of the porphyrin can be reflected in rather significant differences between the photophysical properties of the resulting systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>1,1,2,2&#8208;Tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;containing compounds are valuable structures due to their unique physicochemical properties, which have increasing potential application in drug discovery. However, synthetic methods for preparing such compounds are rare. Herein, we report the first use of 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethanesulfonyl chloride to introduce the HCF2CF2 group into organic molecules via a three&#8208;component, radical tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;heteroarylation of alkenes with readily available quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones. This method provides a new and facile approach for late&#8208;stage functionalization of potential biologically active molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed Decarboxylative Allylations: Development and Mechanistic Studies.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, there has been a concerted drive to develop methods that are greener and more sustainable. Being an earth&#8208;abundant transition metal, cobalt offers an attractive substitute for commonly employed precious metal catalysts, though reactions engaging cobalt are still less developed. Herein, we report a method to achieve the decarboxylative allylation of nitrophenyl alkanes, nitroalkanes, and ketones employing cobalt. The reaction allows for the formation of various substituted allylated products in moderate&#8208;excellent yields with a broad scope. Additionally, the synthetic potential of the methodology is demonstrated by the transformation of products into versatile heterocyclic motifs. Mechanistic studies revealed an in situ activation of the Co(II)/dppBz precatalyst by the carboxylate salt to generate a Co(I)&#8208;species, which is presumed to be the active catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced NiH Catalysis with Trialkylamines for the Stereodivergent Transfer Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a selectivity&#8208;switchable nickel hydride&#8208;catalyzed methodology that enables the stereocontrolled semi&#8208;reduction of internal alkynes to E&#8208; or Z&#8208;alkenes under very mild conditions. The proposed transfer semi&#8208;hydrogenation process involves the use of a dual nickel/photoredox catalytic system and triethylamine, not only as a sacrificial reductant, but also as a source of hydrogen atoms. Mechanistic studies revealed a pathway involving photo&#8208;induced generation of nickel hydride, syn&#8208;hydronickelation of alkyne, and alkenylnickel isomerization as key steps. Remarkably, mechanistic experiments indicate that the control of the stereoselectivity is not ensuing from a post&#8208;reduction alkene photoisomerization under our conditions. Instead, we demonstrate that the stereoselectivity of the reaction is dependent on the rate of a final protonolysis step which can be tuned by adjusting the pKa of an alcohol additive.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of undescribed b&#8208;aminodifluoroethylsulfinates and their uses in the hydroaminodifluoroalkylation of alkenes is reported. This reaction is performed in the presence of a photocatalyst (4CzIPN, Ru complexes) and enables the direct incorporation of a b&#8208;difluoroamine moiety onto vinylic aryls, unactivated alkenes, and electron&#8211;rich, or &#8211;deficient alkenes. The mechanism was studied and the formation of a gem&#8208;difluoromethyl radical is observed after the selective oxidation of the sulfinate function.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereomerically Pure Titanocenes by Dynamic Conformational Locking</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conformational locking of unbridged substituted titanocenes is achieved by the introduction of chiral anionic ligands. A novel method for the synthesis of monosubstituted, enantio&#8208; and diastereomerically pure titanocenes with C2&#8208;symmetry in the (RC5H4)2Ti fragment by reacting the methylated complexes with camphorsulfonic acid is presented. This study encompasses data from NMR and X&#8208;ray analysis as well as a mechanistic investigation with the aid of state of the art DFT calculations.







Abstract
The synthesis of enantiomerically pure titanocenes is limited to cases with enantiomerically pure substituents at the cyclopentadienyl ligands and to ansa&#8208;titanocenes. For the latter complexes, the use of achiral ligands requires a resolution of enantiomers and frequently also a separation of the diastereoisomers obtained after metalation. Here, we introduce a new synthetic method that relies on the use of enantiomerically pure camphorsulfonate (CSA) ligands as control elements for the absolute and relative configuration of titanocene complexes. Starting from the conformationally flexible (RC5H4)2TiCl2, the desired conformationally locked and hence enantio&#8208; and diastereomerically pure complexes (RC5H4)2Ti(CSA)2 are obtained in just two steps. According to X&#8208;ray crystallography the (RC5H4)2Ti fragment is essentially C2&#8208;symmetric and nuclear magnetic resonance displays overall C2&#8208;symmetry. We applied density functional theory methods to unravel the dynamics of the complexes and the mechanisms and selectivities of their formation.

         <title>Kinetic Analysis of the Photochemical Paths in Asymmetric Diarylethene Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric diarylethene dimer composed of two different diarylethenes exhibited multicolor photochromism and generated four isomers. Photochemical paths such as quantum yields, lifetimes, and rate constants were evaluated from the points of the dimer&#8208; and unit&#8208;based models. The m&#8208;phenylene spacer regulates the rate of energy transfer to be similar value of photoisomerization.







Abstract
An asymmetric diarylethene dimer composed of 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;thienylethene units linked by m&#8208;phenylene developed various colors upon UV irradiation via an independent photochromic reaction on each unit. The change in contents and the other photoresponses of the photogenerated four isomers were analyzed using quantum yield for all the possible photochemical paths, i.&#8201;e., photoisomerization, fluorescence, energy transfer, and the other non&#8208;radiative paths. Almost all the rate constants of photochemical paths were calculated using measurable quantum yields and lifetimes. It was found that a significant contribution on photoresponse was the competition between photoisomerization and intramolecular energy transfer. The clear difference was observed in the photoresponses of the dimer and the 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture solution of the model compounds. The m&#8208;phenylene spacer appropriately regulated the rate of energy transfer in the asymmetric dimer, and the spacer enabled isolation of the excited state of the dimer, making the above quantitative analysis possible.

         <title>Acidic CO2 Electrolysis Addressing the &#8220;Alkalinity Issue&#8221; and Achieving High CO2 Utilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Currently, CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) mainly adopt alkaline or neutral electrolytes to suppress the hydrogen evolution (HER), but with significant drawback of (bi)carbonate crossover, leading to low carbon utilization efficiency. CO2RR in acidic electrolytes can alleviate the &#8220;alkalinity problem&#8221;, but the competing HER is more kinetically favourable. Thus, it is a priority to effectively suppress HER and accelerate acidic CO2 electrolysis.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides a promising approach for sustainable chemical fuel production of carbon neutrality. Neutral and alkaline electrolytes are predominantly employed in the current electrolysis system, but with striking drawbacks of (bi)carbonate (CO32&#8722;/HCO3&#8722;) formation and crossover due to the rapid and thermodynamically favourable reaction between hydroxide (OH&#8722;) with CO2, resulting in low carbon utilization efficiency and short&#8208;lived catalysis. Very recently, CO2RR in acidic media can effectively address the (bi)carbonate issue; however, the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is more kinetically favourable in acidic electrolytes, which dramatically reduces CO2 conversion efficiency. Thus, it is a big challenge to effectively suppress HER and accelerate acidic CO2RR. In this review, we begin by summarizing the recent progress of acidic CO2 electrolysis, discussing the key factors limiting the application of acidic electrolytes. We then systematically discuss addressing strategies for acidic CO2 electrolysis, including electrolyte microenvironment modulation, alkali cations adjusting, surface/interface functionalization, nanoconfinement structural design, and novel electrolyzer exploitation. Finally, the new challenges and perspectives of acidic CO2 electrolysis are suggested. We believe this timely review can arouse researchers&#8242; attention to CO2 crossover, inspire new insights to solve the &#8220;alkalinity problem&#8221; and enable CO2RR as a more sustainable technology.

         <title>Regioselective Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed C8&#8208;H Borylation of 4&#8208;Quinolones via Transient O&#8208;Borylated Quinolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The quinolone&#8211;quinoline tautomerization allows the regioselective C8&#8208;borylation of biologically important 4&#8208;quinolones by using [Ir(OMe)(cod)]2 as catalyst precursor, Si&#8208;SMAP as the ligand, and B2pin2 as boron source. Following O&#8208;borylation of the quinoline tautomer, N&#8208;directed selective Ir&#8208;catalyzed borylation takes place at C8. Hydrolysis of the OBpin moiety on workup returns the system to the quinolone tautomer.







Abstract
The quinolone&#8211;quinoline tautomerization is harnessed to effect the regioselective C8&#8208;borylation of biologically important 4&#8208;quinolones by using [Ir(OMe)(cod)]2 as the catalyst precursor, the silica&#8208;supported monodentate phosphine Si&#8208;SMAP as the ligand, and B2pin2 as the boron source. Initially, O&#8208;borylation of the quinoline tautomer takes place. Critically, the newly formed 4&#8208;(pinBO)&#8208;quinolines then undergo N&#8208;directed selective Ir&#8208;catalyzed borylation at C8. Hydrolysis of the OBpin moiety on workup returns the system to the quinolone tautomer. The C8&#8208;borylated quinolines were converted to their corresponding potassium trifluoroborate (BF3K) salts and to their C8&#8208;chlorinated quinolone derivatives. The two&#8208;step C&#8208;H borylation&#8208;chlorination reaction sequence resulted in various C8&#8208;Cl quinolones in good yields. Conversion to C8&#8208;OH&#8208;, C8&#8208;NH2&#8208;, and C8&#8208;Ar&#8208;substituted quinolones was also feasible by using this methodology.

         <title>Electrochemical Preparation of Sm(II) Reagent Facilitated by Weakly Coordinating Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical analysis of the potential and reversibility of the Sm(11)/Sm(111) redox couple will inform the development of electrocatalytic Sm&#8208;driven reactions in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Samarium diiodide (SmI2) is widely used as a strong one&#8208;electron reducing agent and is often employed to form C&#8722;C bonds in complex systems. Despite their utility, SmI2 and related salts suffer from several drawbacks that render the use of Sm reducing agents in large&#8208;scale synthesis impractical. Here, we report factors influencing the electrochemical reduction of Sm(III) to Sm(II), towards the goal of electrocatalytic Sm(III) reduction. We probe the effect of supporting electrolyte, electrode material, and Sm precursor on Sm(II)/(III) redox and on the reducing power of the Sm species. We find that the coordination strength of the counteranion of the Sm salt affects the reversibility and redox potential of the Sm(II)/(III) couple and establish that the counteranion primarily determines the reducibility of Sm(III). Electrochemically generated SmI2 performs similarly to commercial SmI2 solutions in a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept reaction. The results will provide fundamental insight to facilitate the development of Sm&#8208;electrocatalytic reactions.

     alt="Electrochemical Preparation of Sm(II) Reagent Facilitated by Weakly Coordinating Anions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical analysis of the potential and reversibility of the Sm(11)/Sm(111) redox couple will inform the development of electrocatalytic Sm-driven reactions in organic synthesis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samarium diiodide (SmI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is widely used as a strong one-electron reducing agent and is often employed to form C&#8722;C bonds in complex systems. Despite their utility, SmI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and related salts suffer from several drawbacks that render the use of Sm reducing agents in large-scale synthesis impractical. Here, we report factors influencing the electrochemical reduction of Sm(III) to Sm(II), towards the goal of electrocatalytic Sm(III) reduction. We probe the effect of supporting electrolyte, electrode material, and Sm precursor on Sm(II)/(III) redox and on the reducing power of the Sm species. We find that the coordination strength of the counteranion of the Sm salt affects the reversibility and redox potential of the Sm(II)/(III) couple and establish that the counteranion primarily determines the reducibility of Sm(III). Electrochemically generated SmI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; performs similarly to commercial SmI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solutions in a proof-of-concept reaction. The results will provide fundamental insight to facilitate the development of Sm-electrocatalytic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Substrate Selectivity Imparted by Self&#8208;Assembled Molecular Containers and Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent trends in catalysis are devoted to mimicking some peculiar features of enzymes like site selectivity, through functional group recognition, and substrate selectivity, through recognition of the entire surface of the substrate. The latter is a specific feature of enzymes that is seldomly present in homogeneous catalysis. Supramolecular catalysis, thanks to the self&#8208;assembly of simple subunits, enables the creation of cavities and surfaces whose confinement effects drive the preferential binding of a substrate among others with consequent substrate selectivity. The topic is an emerging field that exploits recognition phenomena to discriminate the reagents based on their size and shape. This review deals this cutting&#8208;edge field of research covering examples of supramolecular self&#8208;assembled molecular containers and catalysts operating in organic as well as aqueous media, with special emphasis for catalytic systems dealing with direct competitive experiments involving two or more substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Isomerization&#8208;Hydroboration of Alkenes Affords Terminal Functionalization at Remote C&#8208;H Position</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein the synthesis and characterization of nickel complexes supported by tridentate and bidentate phosphino(silyl) ancillary ligands, along with the successful application of these complexes as precatalysts for the hydroboration of terminal and internal alkenes using pinacolborane (HBPin). These reactions proceeded with low nickel loadings of 2.5&#8208;5 mol % in the absence of co&#8208;solvent, and in some cases at room temperature. Isomerization to afford exclusively the terminal hydroboration product was obtained across a range of internal alkenes, including tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted examples. This reactivity is unprecedented for nickel and offers a powerful means of achieving functionalization at a C&#8208;H position remote from the C=C double bond. Nickel&#8208;catalyzed deuteroboration experiments using DBPin support a mechanism involving 1,2&#8208;insertion of the alkene and subsequent chain&#8208;walking, which results in isotopic scrambling.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Catalysts Enhance the Asymmetric Cyanation of Ketimines and Aldimines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly enantioselective cyanation of imines (up to &gt;99% ee) has been developed using well&#8208;designed C2&#8208;symmetric hydrogen bonding catalysts. The catalytic strategy was characterized with low catalyst loading (0.1&#8208;1 mol%), easily accessible catalysts with diverse functional groups, and catalytic base additives. A wide range of imines, including the challenging N&#8208;Boc and N&#8208;Cbz protected ketimines and aldimines, as well as fluoroalkylated ketimines, were investigated under mild conditions to afford the products with good to excellent yields (up to 99% yield) and high enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99% ee). Control experiments revealed that the multiple hydrogen bonding catalysts enhanced the reactivity and enantioselectivity of the Strecker reaction initiated by the base.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The prominent role of gold&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes in numerous research areas such as homogeneous (photo)catalysis, medicinal chemistry and materials science has prompted organometallic chemists to design gold&#8208;based synthons that permit access to target complexes through simple synthetic steps under mild conditions. In this review, the main gold&#8208;NHC synthons employed in organometallic synthesis are discussed.

         <dc:description>We report a heterocyclic merging approach to construct novel indazolo&#8208;piperazines and indazolo&#8208;morpholines. Starting from chiral diamines and amino alcohols, novel regiochemically (1,3 and 1,4) and stereochemically diverse (relative and absolute) cohorts of indazolo&#8208;piperazines and indazolo&#8208;morpholines were obtained within 6&#8208;7 steps. The key transformations involved are a Smiles rearrangement to generate the indazole core structure and a late stage Michael addition to build the piperazine and morpholine heterocycles. We further explored additional vector diversity by incorporating substitutions on the indazole aromatic ring, generating a total of 20 unique enantiomerically pure heterocyclic scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation as a Key Step in the Synthesis of the Phosphonic Acid Analogues to Aminocarboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Aminophosphonic acids have a remarkably broad bioactivity spectrum. They can function as highly efficient transition state mimics for a variety of hydrolytic and angiotensin&#8208;converting enzymes, which makes them interesting target structures for synthetic chemists. Especially the phosphonic acid analogues to &#945;&#8208;aminocarboxylic acids (PaAAs) are potent enzyme inhibitors, but many of them are only available by chiral or enzymatic resolutions, sometimes only one enantiomer is accessible, and several have never been prepared in enantiopure form at all. Today, a variety of methods to access enantiopure &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonic acids are known but none of the reported approaches can be generally applied for the synthesis of PaAAs. Here we show that the phosphonic acid analogues to many (proteinogenic) &#945;&#8208;amino acids become accessible by the catalytic, stereoselective asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) of &#945;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphonates. The obtained highly enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;hydroxyphosphonates (enantiomeric excess [ee] &#8805; 98%) are important pharmaceutical building blocks themselves and could be easily converted to &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonic acids in most studied cases. Even stereoselectively deuterated analogues became easily accessible from the same &#945;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphonates using formic acid (DCO2H).</dc:description>

         <title>The Rise of Structurally Anisotropic Plasmonic Janus Gold Nanostars</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Stepwise Functionalization of Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes with Subsequent Molecular Conversion to Control Photoluminescence Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalization of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) has attracted interest because it alters the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photoluminescence (PL) wavelength and emission efficiency. These modifications depend on the binding configuration and degree of functionalization. Excessive functionalization reduces the emission efficiency as the integrity of the conjugated&#160;p&#8208;system decreases, making controlling the degree of functionalization essential. Because the binding configurations and degree of functionalization are affected by the reagent structure, a stepwise approach combining functionalization reactions of SWNTs and subsequent reactions to introduce functional groups into the addenda could effectively control their PL properties and functionalities. We studied this approach by implementing the reductive alkylation of SWNTs using bromoalkanes with&#160;t&#8208;butyl carbamate (Boc)&#8208;protected amino groups and subsequent deprotection and amidation reactions. The reaction products were analyzed based on absorption, PL, and Raman spectroscopy and the Kaiser test. Depending on the structure of the reagent, deprotection and amidation reactions competed with the elimination reaction of addenda, changing the PL properties of the SWNTs. Furthermore, the elimination reaction was inhibited in the adducts functionalized with dibromoalkane with Boc&#8208;protected amino groups, demonstrating that the use of appropriate reagents enables molecular conversion of the functional groups of SWNT adducts without affecting their PL properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Staightforward Synthesis of Halopyridine Aldehydes via Diaminomethylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel two&#8208;step method for formylation of fluoropyridines with silylformamidine 1 under catalyst&#8208;free conditions was developed. A series of possible 18 fluoropyridines featuring one to four fluorine atoms were subjected to the reaction with 1 existing in equilibrium with its carbenic form 1&#8242;.12 Fluoropyridines were shown to react via C&#8208;H insertion. The reaction proceeded either at &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;positions affording the corresponding aminals. The more fluorine atoms in pyridines, the easier the reaction proceeded. We also hypothesized that the pyridines in which the fluorine was substituted by other halogens would react in a similar manner. To test the hypothesis, a set of 3,5&#8208;disubstituted pyridines with various combination of halogen atoms was prepared. 3,5&#8208;Difluoropyridine was taken as a compound for comparison. All the pyridines in the series also reacted likewise. In most cases, hydrolysis of the aminals afforded the corresponding aldehydes. As DFT calculations indicate, the reaction mechanism includes deprotonation of pyridine by 1&#8242; as a strong base and the following rearrangement of the formed tight ionic pair to the final product. An alternative reaction pathway involving addition of 1&#8242; to the pyridine carbon with the following hydrogen transfer via a three&#8208;membered transition state structure required much higher activation energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrofluorination of Alkynes: From (E) to (Z)</title>

         <dc:description>The hydrofluorination of alkynes is an efficient synthetic route to monofluoroalkenes or difluoroalkanes. Both fluorinated motifs have found applications in medicinal chemistry and beyond. This review explores the recent advances in the hydrofluorination of diverse alkynes through various activation methods, from classical coinage metal catalysis to metal&#8208;free conditions. The range of alkynes goes from the simplest unactivated alkynes to activated ones (ynones and derivatives, ynamides, alkynyl sulfides and sulfones as much as haloalkynes). Regio&#8208; and stereoselective methods exists, but there is still room for improvement depending on the type of alkyne.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterocyclic [9]helicenes exhibiting bright circular polarized luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a concise synthetic strategy for the preparation of heterocyclic [9]helicenes and a simple preparative&#8208;scale protocol for the optical resolution of the resulting M&#8208; and P&#8208;enantiomers. The helicenes were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction along with a range of spectroscopic and computational techniques. A fluorescence quantum yield of up to 65% was observed, and the chiroptical properties of both M&#8208; and P&#8208;helicenes revealed large dissymmetry factors. The CPL brightness reaches up to 17 M&#8208;1 cm&#8208;1, as measured experimentally and verified computationally, which makes this the highest CPL brightness among heterocyclic helicenes. We describe how chiroptical properties (both CD and CPL) can be described and predicted using DFT calculations. The synthetic approach also reveals by&#8208;products that originate from internal oxidation reactions, presumably mediated by the close proximity of the &#960;&#8208;surfaces in the helicene structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Recognition of Aromatics in Spherical Nanocages.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In general, due to the lack of efficient specific molecular interactions, achieving host&#8208;guest molecular recognition inside large and neutral metal organic cages (MOCs) is challenging. Preferential molecular recognition of aromatics using the internal binding sites of interlocked icosahedral (i.e., spherical) M12L8MOCs within poly&#8208;[n]&#8208;catenane (1) is reported. The guest absorption has been monitored directly in the solid&#8208;state by consecutive single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) reactions in a gas&#8208;solid environment, using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD) experiments. The preferential guest uptake is corroborated by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations by determining the host&#8208;guest interaction energy (Ehost&#8208;guest) with the nitrobenzene (NB) &gt;&gt; p&#8208;xylene (p&#8208;xy) &gt;&gt; o&#8208;dichlorobenzene (o&#8208;DCB) trend (i.e., from 44 kcal/mol to 25 kcal/mol), assessing the XRD outcomes. Combining SC&#8208;XRD, DFT and solid&#8208;state 13C NMR, the exceptional stability of the M12L8 cages, together with the guest exchange/release properties are rationalized by the presence of mechanical bonds (efficient &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions) and by the pyridine&#8217;s rotor&#8208;like behaviour (with 3 kcal/mol rotational energy barrier). The structure&#8208;function properties of M12L8 makes 1 a potential candidate in the field of molecular sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanical Interlocking to Unlock the Reinforcing Potential of Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) present extraordinary mechanical properties, with Youngs&#8217; modulus &gt; 1 TPa and tensile strength &gt; 50 GPa which makes them ideal candidates as fillers for the reinforcement of polymers. However, the performance of SWNTs in this field has fallen behind expectations. This is due to a combination of imperfect individualization of the SWNTs and poor load transfer from the polymer to the SWNTs. Here, we study the reinforcement of polymers of different chemical nature using mechanically interlocked derivatives of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MINTs). We compare the mechanical properties of fibers made of poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and polysulfone (PSU) and their composites made with pristine SWNTs, MINTs, and the corresponding supramolecular models. With very low loading of MINTs (0.01% w/w), improvements of more than 100% on Youngs Modulus and the tensile strength are observed for both the nonpolar aliphatic PMMA and the very polar aromatic PSU polymers, while pristine carbon nanotubes and the supramolecular nanofillers showed smaller reinforcement. These data, together with our previous report on the reinforcement of polystyrene (nonpolar and aromatic), indicate that derivatization of SWNTs as MINTs is a valid general strategy to optimize the interaction between SWNT fillers and the polymer matrix.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) present extraordinary mechanical properties, with Youngs&#8217; modulus &amp;gt; 1 TPa and tensile strength &amp;gt; 50 GPa which makes them ideal candidates as fillers for the reinforcement of polymers. However, the performance of SWNTs in this field has fallen behind expectations. This is due to a combination of imperfect individualization of the SWNTs and poor load transfer from the polymer to the SWNTs. Here, we study the reinforcement of polymers of different chemical nature using mechanically interlocked derivatives of single-walled carbon nanotubes (MINTs). We compare the mechanical properties of fibers made of poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and polysulfone (PSU) and their composites made with pristine SWNTs, MINTs, and the corresponding supramolecular models. With very low loading of MINTs (0.01% w/w), improvements of more than 100% on Youngs Modulus and the tensile strength are observed for both the nonpolar aliphatic PMMA and the very polar aromatic PSU polymers, while pristine carbon nanotubes and the supramolecular nanofillers showed smaller reinforcement.

         <title>Induction and Stabilization of Columnar Mesophases in Fluorinated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by Arene&#8208;Perfluoroarene Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The straightforward synthesis of several Fluorinated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by the efficient, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, arene fluorine nucleophilic substitution reaction is reported, and the full investigation of their liquid crystalline and optical properties reported. The key precursors for this study, i.e. 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dilithio&#8208;4,4',5,5'&#8208;tetraalkoxy&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;biphenyl alkylated derivatives, were obtained in two steps from the highly selective Scholl oxidative homo&#8208;coupling of 3,4&#8208;dialkoxy&#8208;1&#8208;bromobenzene, followed by quantitative double&#8208;lithiation. In situ room temperature nucleophilic annulation with either perfluorobenzene or perfluoronaphthalene leads to 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;6,7,10,11&#8208;tetraalkxoytriphenylenes and 9,10,11,12,13,14&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2,3,6,7&#8208;tetraalkoxybenzo[f]tetraphenes, respectively, in good yields. Exploiting the same strategy, subsequent double annulations resulted in the formation of 9,18&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2,3,6,7,11,12,15,16&#8208;octa(alkoxy)tribenzo[f,k,m]tetraphenes and 9,10,19,20&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;2,3,6,7,12,13,16,17&#8208;octakis(hexyloxy)tetrabenzo[a,c,j,l]tetracenes, respectively. Despite the presence of only four alkoxy chains, the polar &#8220;Janus&#8221; mesogens display a columnar hexagonal mesophase over broad temperature ranges, with higher mesophase stability than the archetypical 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexa(alkoxy)triphenylenes and their hydrogenated counterparts. The improvement or induction of mesomorphism is attributed to efficient antiparallel face&#8208;to&#8208;face &#960;&#8208;stacking driven by the establishment of non&#8208;covalent perfluoroarene&#8208;arene intermolecular interactions. The larger lipophilic discotic &#960;&#8208;extended compounds also exhibit columnar mesomorphism, over similar temperature ranges and stability than their hydrogenated homologs. Finally, these fluorinated molecules form stringy gels in various solvents, and show interesting solvatochromic emission properties in solution as well as strong emission in thin films and gels.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;5&#8208;Deoxyenterocin and Attempted Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;5&#8208;deoxyenterocin has been accomplished starting from pentane&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triol (16 steps in the longest linear sequence, 0.2% overall yield). (&#8722;)&#8208;Menthone served as the source of chirality to distinguish the enantiotopic hydroxymethyl groups of the substrate. Key steps of the synthesis include two aldol reactions to either end of the C5&#8208;skeleton, a diastereoselective hydroxylation reaction and a biomimetic two&#8208;fold intramolecular aldol reaction as the final step. Although this step suffered from geometrical constraints and was low&#8208;yielding (10%), enough synthetic material could be secured to substantiate the relative and absolute configuration of the natural product. Additional experiments were directed toward a C&#8722;H functionalization at carbon atom C5. Despite the fact that several protocols could be successfully applied to (3aR)&#8208;(+)&#8208;scerolide as model substrate, (&#8722;)&#8208;5&#8208;deoxyenterocin withstood any selective functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>The Rapid Synthesis of Colibactin Warhead Model Compounds Using New Metal&#8208;Free Photocatalytic Cyclopropanation Reactions Facilitates the Investigation of Biological Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of colibactin warhead model compounds using two newly developed metal&#8208;free photocatalytic cyclopropanation reactions. These mild cyclopropanations expand the known applications of eosin within synthesis. A halogen atom transfer reaction mode has been harnessed so that dihalides can be used as the cyclopropanating agents. The colibactin warhead models were then used to provide new insight into two key mechanisms in colibactin chemistry. An explanation is provided for why the colibactin warhead sometimes undergoes a ring expansion&#8208;addition reaction to give fused cyclobutyl products while at other times nucleophiles add directly to the cyclopropyl unit (as when DNA adds to colibactin). Finally, we provide some evidence that Cu(II) chelated to colibactin may catalyze an important oxidation of the colibactin&#8208;DNA adduct. The Cu(I) generated as a result could then also play a role in inducing double strand breaks in DNA.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>To ESPT, or not to ESPT. The effective utilization of luminescent dyes often relies on a comprehensive understanding of their excitation and relaxation pathways. One such pathway, Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer (ESPT), involves the tautomerization of the dye in its excited state, resulting in a new structure that exhibits distinct emission properties, such as a very large Stokes' shift or dual&#8208;emission. Although the ESPT phenomenon is well&#8208;explained theoretically, its experimental demonstration can be challenging due to the presence of numerous other phenomena that can yield similar experimental observations. In this review, we propose that an all&#8208;encompassing methodology, integrating experimental findings, computational analyses, and a thorough evaluation of diverse mechanisms, is essential for verifying the occurrence of ESPT in luminescent dyes. Investigations have offered significant understanding of the elements impacting the ESPT process and the array of approaches that can be used to validate the existence of ESPT. These discoveries hold crucial ramifications for the advancement of molecular probes, sensors, and other applications that depend on ESPT as a detection mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2&#8208;mediated photocatalytic chlorine production over bismuth oxychloride in chloride solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As one of the most commonly bulky chemicals, chlorine is conventionally manufactured by electrolysis of NaCl solution in the chlor&#8208;alkali process, which requires a huge supply of electrical energy. The photocatalytic route to produce chlorine using solar energy and&#160;NaCl solution&#160;offers a promising strategy to reduce energy consumption and bring economic benefits. Herein, we found that the introduction of CO2 would enhance the productivity of Cl2 from 8.24 &#956;mol&#183;h&#8722;1 to 39.6 &#956;mol&#183;h&#8722;1 in NaCl solution over BiOCl. Experimental studies reveal that the CO2 species (CO32&#8722;) entered into the crystal texture of BiOCl and the interlayer space between [Bi2O2]2+ slabs were increased and distorted, accelerating the cycle of Cl species. Besides, the cycle of carbonate species also existed and accelerated the reaction efficiency of Cl&#8722; oxidation to Cl2. This work provides a new feasible method of using abundant CO2 resources to accelerate the process of chlorine production via photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This work elucidates the potential impact of intramolecular H&#8208;bonds within the pore walls of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) on proton conductivity. Employing DaTta and TaTta as representative hosts, it was observed that their innate proton conductivities (&#963;) are both unsatisfactory and &#963;(DaTta) &lt; &#963;(TaTta). Intriguingly, the performance of both imidazole&#8208;loaded products, Im@DaTta and Im@TaTta is greatly improved, and the &#963; of Im@DaTta (0.91 &#215; 10&#8208;2 S&#183;cm&#8208;1) even surpasses that of Im@TaTta (3.73 &#215; 10&#8208;3 S&#183;cm&#8208;1) under 100 &#176;C and 98% relative humidity. The structural analysis, gas adsorption tests, and activation energy calculations forecast the influence of imidazole on the H&#8208;bonded system within the framework, leading to observed changes in proton conductivity. It is hypothesized that intramolecular H&#8208;bonds within the COF framework impede efficient proton transmission. Nevertheless, the inclusion of an imidazole group disrupts these intramolecular bonds, leading to the formation of an abundance of intermolecular H&#8208;bonds within the pore channels, thus contributing to a dramatic increase in proton conductivity. The related calculation of Density Functional Theory (DFT) provides further evidence for this inference.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrochemiluminescence from Imidazole&#8208;Based Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A family of novel Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) emitters have been synthetized by a straightforward and metal&#8208;free synthesis, and structurally characterized. In this work we keep fixed the acceptor moiety, 4&#8208;(1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzonitrile, and systemically tested different donors to correlate their photophysical and electrochemical properties with their performance in electrochemiluminescence using both benzoyl peroxide as coreactant and coreactant free (annihilation) conditions. Some compounds exceed the efficiency of the standard [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 up to 28 times with benzoyl peroxide and 38 times in annihilation. Interestingly, we found that the efficiency is mainly dictated by the electrochemical reversibility of redox processes rather than by the photophysical properties in terms of photoluminescence quantum yield or excited state lifetime. In addition, the annihilation electrochemiluminescence efficiency strongly depend on the pulse sequence. The imidazole moiety can be conveniently alkylated allowing the insertion of functional groups, such a carboxylic acid, enabling practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>The structure of Maneb: An important manganese&#8208;containing bis(dithiocarbamate) fungicide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Maneb is a manganese(II) containing fungicide with a multi&#8208;site effect and no resistance, therefore it is widely applied in many parts of the world. There is however mounting evidence for neurotoxic effects with Parkinson&#8208;like symptoms (manganism) related to usage of Maneb. Due to its insolubility in most solvents and its paramagnetism, structural elucidation is not trivial and thus its exact molecular structure remains unknown. We report herein a synthesis procedure to prepare Maneb reproducibly in pure form and the use of various analytical techniques including X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and electron diffraction to determine the molecular structure of Maneb in the solid state and also in solution.</dc:description>
