         <title>Cyclic Ruthenium(II)&#8722;Halocarbon Complexes Derived from Ru(II)&#8208;Induced Cyclization of Homopropargylic Halopyridines: Mechanism, Bonding and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activation of various homopropargylic pyridines by cis&#8208;[RuII/OsII(dppm)2Cl2] (dppm = 1,1&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)methane) has previously been shown to generate a diverse array of metallacycles and metalated heterocyclic complexes. However, a minor structural modification of introducing a halide onto the pyridyl group of the alkyne substrate resulted in the formation of unprecedented Ru(II)/Os(II)&#8722;haloquinolizine complexes. These complexes display (1) &#954;2(X,C)&#8208;haloquinolizine chelates arising from the cycloisomerization of HC&#8801;CC(OH)(CH2(6&#8208;X&#8208;2&#8208;py))(Ph) on [RuII/OsII(dppm)2]2+ moieties via a vinylidene pathway, (2) five&#8208;membered Ru/Os&#8722;X&#8722;C&#8722;N&#8722;C rings (X = F, Cl, Br) ortho&#8208; and peri&#8208;fused to quinolizinium skeletons, and (3) uncommon M&#8722;X&#8722;R bonding interactions that are atypical in coordination complexes. Despite being divalent and integrated into a five&#8208;membered Ru&#8722;X&#8722;C&#8722;N&#8722;C ring system, the X atoms in the Ru(II) complexes are susceptible to substitution by O in the presence of &#8722;OH, resulting in the formation of quinolizinium&#8208;fused ruthenaoxazole complexes. Overall, this work highlights the importance of considering metal&#8722;halocarbon bonding interactions in catalytic or coordination designs.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Electron&#160;NO to N2O Pathways via Heme Models and Lewis Acid: Metal Effects&#160;and Differences from the Enzymatic Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Some pathogens use heme&#8208;containing nitric oxide reductases (NORs) to reduce NO to N2O as their defense mechanism to detoxify NO and reduce nitrosative stress. This reduction is also significant in the global N cycle. Our previous experimental work showed that Fe and Co porphyrin NO complexes can couple with external NO to form N2O when activated by the Lewis acid BF3. A key difference from conventional two&#8208;electron enzymatic reaction is that one electron is sufficient. However, a complete understanding of the entire reaction pathways and the more favorable reactivity for Fe remains unknown. Here, we present a quantum chemical study to provide such information. Our results confirmed Fe&#8217;s higher experimental reactivity, showing advantages in all steps of the reaction pathway: easier metal oxidation for NO reduction and N&#8208;O cleavage as well as a larger size to expedite the N/O coordination mode transition. The Co system, with a similar product energy as the enzyme, shows potential for further development in catalytic NO coupling. This work also offers the first evidence that this new one&#8208;electron NO reduction is both kinetically competitive and thermodynamically more favorable than the native pathway, supporting future initiatives in optimizing NO reduction agents in biology, environment, and industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation and Stability of Benzylic Amide [2]&#8208; and [3]Rotaxanes: An Intercomponent Interactions Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the synthesis and characterization of amide&#8208;benzylic [2]&#8208; and [3]rotaxanes that include a conventional succinamide station and an innovative triazole&#8208;carbonyl station. The macrocycle preference for one station was evidenced by NMR and SC&#8208;XRD analyses. The slight modifications in the thread structure impacted the stability and intercomponent interactions, guiding the selective formation of [2]&#8208; or [3]rotaxanes.







Abstract
One of the most recent focuses in supramolecular chemistry is developing molecules designed to exhibit programmable properties at the molecular level. Rotaxanes, which function as molecular machines with movements controlled by external stimuli, are prime candidates for this purpose. However, the controlled synthesis of rotaxanes, especially amide&#8208;benzylic rotaxanes with more than two components, remains an area ripe for exploration. In this study, we aim to elucidate the formation of amide&#8208;benzylic [3]rotaxanes using a thread that includes a conventional succinamide station and an innovative triazole&#8208;carbonyl station. Including the triazole&#8208;carbonyl station introduces new perspectives into the chemistry of rotaxanes, influencing their conformation and dynamics. The synthesis of two&#8208;station rotaxanes with varying stoppers demonstrated that the macrocycle consistently occupies the succinamide station, providing greater stability as evidenced by NMR and SC&#8208;XRD analyses. The presence of a triazole&#8208;carbonyl station facilitated the formation of a second macrocycle exclusively when a secondary amide was employed as the stopper group, presumably due to decreased steric hindrance. Moreover, the second macrocycle directly forms at the triazole&#8208;carbonyl station. This investigation reveals that slight modifications in the thread structure can dramatically impact the formation, stability, and interactions between components of rotaxanes.

         <title>Melanin and Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Melanin in Nature is responsible for photoprotection and coloration hence performs its function by interacting with light. Recent studies demonstrate that light activate both in natural and biomimetic melanin different processes that can be in approximatively distinguished in photochemical and photothermal. Several questions remain to be answered to understand the unique interaction of melanin and light.







Abstract
Melanin is responsible, in Nature, for photoprotection, for this reason it is expected to be poorly photoreactive. However, the photo&#8208;reactivity of melanin and related materials is well documented. Here we discuss some relevant recent examples to demonstrate that, indeed, the actual mechanism of interaction of melanin with light is complex and still not completely understood. Photochemical and photothermal processes are involved, giving a contribution that strongly depends on light wavelength and intensity. Moreover, some interesting experiments demonstrated that photochemical reactivity of melanin related compounds is likely to be indirect, in the sense that the effect of light is to increase the number of radical species rather than creating photoreactive excited state. These suggestions open&#8208;up new perspectives in the interpretation of the role of melanin in photoprotection and in the design of new melanin based photoactive materials for energy conversion, environmental remediation, and nanomedicine. Further complication is given by the role of atmospheric oxygen and humidity in the photoinduced processes. Beside this complexity of behavior makes it difficult a systematic understanding of the interaction of melanin with light, it surely strongly contributes to make the properties of melanin and related materials unique.

         <title>Uncovering the Potent Antiviral Activity of the Sesterterpenoids from the Sponge Ircinia Felix Against Human Adenoviruses: from the Natural Source to the Total Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolation, structure elucidation, biological activity, and total synthesis of ircinialactam J, a novel sesterterpene lactam produced by the sponge Ircinia felix, is presented. Ircinialactam J displays a significant antiviral activity against Human Adenoviruses (11 times more active than cidofovir&#174;) without cytotoxicity. This work reports the first synthesis of a lactamic sesterterpene.







Abstract
Human Adenovirus (HAdV) infections in immunocompromised patients can result in disseminated diseases with high morbidity and mortality rates due to the absence of available treatments for these infections. The sponge Ircinia felix was selected for the significant anti&#8208;HAdV activity displayed by its organic extracts. Its chemical analysis yielded three novel sesterterpene lactams, ircinialactams J&#8722;L, along with three known sesterterpene furans which structures were established by a deep spectrometric analysis. Ircinialactam J displayed significant antiviral activity against HAdV without significant cytotoxicity, showing an effectiveness 11 times greater than that of the standard treatment, cidofovir&#174;. Comparison of the antiviral evaluation results of the isolated compounds allowed us to deduce some structure&#8208;activity relationships. Mechanistic assays suggest that ircinialactam J targets an early step of the HAdV replicative cycle before HAdV genome reaches the nucleus of the host cell. The first total synthesis of ircinialactam J was also accomplished to prove the structure and to provide access to analogues. Key steps are a regio&#8208; and stereoselective construction of the trisubstituted Z&#8208;olefin at &#916;7 by iron&#8208;catalyzed carbometallation of a homopropargylic alcohol, a stereoselective methylation to generate the stereogenic center at C18, and the formation of the (Z)&#8208;&#916;20 by stereoselective aldol condensation to introduce the tetronic acid unit. Ircinialactam J is a promising chemical lead to new potent antiviral drugs against HAdV infections.

Comparison of the antiviral evaluation results of the isolated compounds allowed us to deduce some structure-activity relationships. Mechanistic assays suggest that ircinialactam J targets an early step of the HAdV replicative cycle before HAdV genome reaches the nucleus of the host cell. The first total synthesis of ircinialactam J was also accomplished to prove the structure and to provide access to analogues. Key steps are a regio- and stereoselective construction of the trisubstituted &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-olefin at &#916;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; by iron-catalyzed carbometallation of a homopropargylic alcohol, a stereoselective methylation to generate the stereogenic center at C18, and the formation of the (&lt;i&gt;Z)-&lt;/i&gt;&#916;&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; by stereoselective aldol condensation to introduce the tetronic acid unit. Ircinialactam J is a promising chemical lead to new potent antiviral drugs against HAdV infections.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Probing Noncovalent Interaction Strengths of Host&#8208;Guest Complexes Using Negative Ion Photoelectron Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Noncovalent interactions (NCIs) are the driving forces for the formation and stability of host&#8208;guest complexes that ubiquitously exist in fields as diverse of biology, chemistry, materials sciences, pharmaceuticals, and environmental ion separations. Now the absolute interaction strength of NCIs can be directly and precisely measured by gas&#8208;phase electrospray ionization negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy.







Abstract
Noncovalent interactions (NCIs) are crucial for the formation and stability of host&#8208;guest complexes, which have wide&#8208;ranging implications across various fields, including biology, chemistry, materials science, pharmaceuticals, and environmental science. However, since NCIs are relatively weak and sensitive to bulk perturbation, direct and accurate measurement of their absolute strength has always been a significant challenge. This concept article aims to demonstrate the gas&#8208;phase electrospray ionization (ESI)&#8208;negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy (NIPES) as a direct and precise technique to measure the absolute interaction strength, probe nature of NCIs, and reveal the electronic structural information for host&#8208;guest complexes. Our recent studies in investigating various host&#8208;guest complexes that involve various types of NCIs such as anion&#8211;&#960;, (di)hydrogen bonding, charge&#8208;separated ionic interactions, are overviewed. Finally, a summary and outlook are provided for this field.

         <title>An Imine&#8208;Functionalized Silicone&#8208;Based Epoxy Coating with Stable Adhesion and Controllable Degradation for Enhanced Marine Antifouling and Anticorrosion Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An imine&#8208;functionalized silicone&#8208;based epoxy coating with steady adhesion for enhanced marine antifouling and anticorrosion properties is prepared. The coating exhibits satisfactory comprehensive properties, and its controlled degradation can be achieved in aqueous solutions through temperature and acidity adjustments, which can refrain from incineration or landfilling after failure. The multifunctional coating conforms to the principle of green and sustainable development.







Abstract
Biofouling and corrosion of submerged equipment caused by marine organisms severely restrict the rapid development of the marine industry. Traditional antifouling or anticorrosion coatings typically serve a sole purpose and exhibit limited degradability upon failure, rendering them inadequate for current demands. Herein, a novel imine&#8208;functionalized command&#8208;degradable bio&#8208;based epoxy coating (SAHPEP&#8208;DDM) with enhanced integrated antifouling and anticorrosion performances was synthesized utilizing 1,3&#8208;bis (3&#8208;aminopropyl)&#8208;1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethyldisiloxane and syringaldehyde. Compared with commercial epoxy resins (E51&#8208;DDM) and polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS), the SAHPEP&#8208;DDM coating exhibits superior antifouling and anticorrosion properties due to the existence of &#8211;C=N&#8208; and Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si chain segments in the cross&#8208;linking network. The coating achieves resistance rates of 99.59&#8201;% and 99.20&#8201;% against E. coli and S. aureus, respectively, and shows promising resistance against algae and proteins, as well as excellent corrosion resistance in artificial seawater (with |Z|0.01&#8197;Hz and arc radius of about 1011&#8197;&#937; and exceeding 1010&#8197;&#937; respectively). The coating also exhibits excellent chemical resistance in organic solvents as well as neutral and alkaline environments. Moreover, its controlled degradation after coating failure can be achieved in acid aqueous solutions through temperature and acidity adjustments, facilitated by the presence of &#8211;C=N&#8208;. This work presents a novel degradable coating successfully coupled the dual functions of antifouling and anticorrosion coatings, avoiding the employment of intermediate coat, indicating vast potential for application in various marine engineering fields.

         <title>Migration of para&#8208;Nitrophenyl Groups in Methyl Pyranosides: Configuration and Conformation Determine the Kinetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surprising complexity. O&#8208;Aryl migration in carbohydrates under basic Zempl&#233;n conditions (NaOMe in MeOH) was investigated employing a library of para&#8208;nitrophenyl&#8208;substituted methyl pyranosides. Rate constants and activation energies as obtained from extensive NMR measurements revealed clear migration trends, which could be related to configurational and conformational characteristics. Theoretical chemistry shows the complexity of this seemingly simple reaction.







Abstract
para&#8208;Nitrophenyl (PNP) ethers of glycosides are important building blocks en route to functional carbohydrates. They are stable in neutral media, however, under basic conditions such as during the Zempl&#233;n deacylation of sugars, aryl migration is frequently observed. We have employed a library of O&#8208;PNP&#8208;substituted methyl glycosides of the manno&#8208;, galacto&#8208;, gluco&#8208; and altro&#8208;series to study the kinetics of aryl migration in MeOH/sodium methoxide using NMR spectroscopy revealing that migration between cis&#8208;oriented OH groups is faster than between trans&#8208;oriented ones. The rate constants of migration decrease in the order of Alt&gt;Man&gt;Gal&gt;Glc and are related to the energy barriers of chair conformation inversion. The energy profile of the 3 to 4&#8208;PNP migration in methyl mannoside was calculated using DFT methods suggesting the Meisenheimer complex is an intermediate of PNP migration and that coordination of the sodium cation has a major impact on the energy profile.

         <title>Recent Advances in Electrolytes for Magnesium Batteries: Bridging the gap between Chemistry and Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of suitable electrolytes has been a key challenge for the research and development of rechargeable magnesium batteries. This review discusses the development of various types of electrolytes from the viewpoint of their chemistry and electrochemistry. In particular, it considers the advancement of new conductive magnesium salts and their potential applications.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) have the potential to provide a sustainable and long&#8208;term solution for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to high theoretical capacity of magnesium (Mg) metal as an anode, its competitive redox potential (Mg/Mg2+:&#8722;2.37&#8197;V vs. SHE) and high natural abundance. To develop viable magnesium batteries with high energy density, the electrolytes must meet a range of requirements: high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical potential window, chemical compatibility with electrode materials and other battery components, favourable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial properties and cost&#8208;effective synthesis. In recent years, significant progress in electrolyte development has been made. Herein, a comprehensive overview of these advancements is presented. Beginning with the early developments, we particularly focus on the chemical aspects of the electrolytes and their correlations with electrochemical properties. We also highlight the design of new anions for practical electrolytes, the use of electrolyte additives to optimize anode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces and the progress in polymer electrolytes.

         <title>Copper Nanoclusters Imparted Metalloporphyrin based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strategies that can introduce catalytic auxiliary into electrocatalysts to boost the performance of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) are meaningful in exploring hybrid electrocatalytic systems.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Selective Fluorescence Sensing of Mg2+ and Al3+ Ions by Pincer&#8208;Type NNO Schiff Base Ligand: An Experimental and DFT Optimized Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Schiff base (SB) based dual&#8208;functional fluorescence probe to selectively detect Mg2+ and Al3+ ions in different solvents with rapid, visible fluorescence enhancement. With detection limits of 7.1&#8197;&#956;M for Mg2+ and 0.51&#8197;&#956;M for Al3+Additionally, this probe shows potential for bioimaging, including breast cancer cell imaging, supported by DFT studies







Abstract
A newly developed dual&#8208;functional fluorescence sensing probe (phenylhydrazinyl pyridine) Schiff base (SB) has been designed with good selectivity for distinguishing Mg2+ and Al3+ metal ions in different solvent solutions. SB exhibits quick and visual turn&#8208;on fluorescence enhancement in response to Mg2+ and Al3+ detection. The addition of Mg2+ in ACN&#8211;HEPES buffer (1&#8201;:&#8201;1, v/v, pH&#8197;7.2) at (&#955;max=390&#8197;nm) and Al3+ in MeOH&#8211;HEPES buffer (1&#8201;:&#8201;1, v/v, pH&#8197;7.2) at (&#955;max=360&#8197;nm) resulted in significant enhancement of fluorescence, up to 7&#8211;9 times. These low detection limits of 7.1&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;M (7.1&#8197;&#956;M) and 5.15&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;M (0.51&#8197;&#956;M) for Mg2+ and Al3+, respectively, have been achieved by this solvent&#8208;controlled platform. Due to the sensing potential towards Mg2+, the probe was utilized as an imaging material for breast cancer cells. 1H&#8208;NMR studies were utilized to explore SB's sensing mechanism through turn&#8208;on fluorescence. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were utilized to validate optimized SB and its intricate geometries, which govern the sensing mechanism in the solvent environment. Such a probe has extensive potential applications in bioimaging and the assessment of the quality of wastewater.

         <title>Spectroscopic Properties and Reactivity of a MnIII&#8208;Hydroperoxo Complex that is Stable at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amide&#8208;containing N5 ligand is used to generate a manganese(III)&#8208;hydroperoxo complex that is stable at room temperature and generated using a stoichiometric amount of H2O2. The stability of this complex permits detailed investigation of its spectroscopic properties and analysis of decay kinetics. Despite its high thermal stability, the new manganese(III)&#8208;hydroperoxo is more reactive than manganese(III)&#8208;alkylperoxo analogues in substrate oxidation reactions.







Abstract
Manganese catalysts that activate hydrogen peroxide have seen increased use in organic transformations, such as olefin epoxidation and alkane C&#8722;H bond oxidation. Proposed mechanisms for these catalysts involve the formation and activation of MnIII&#8208;hydroperoxo intermediates. Examples of well&#8208;defined MnIII&#8208;hydroperoxo complexes are rare, and the properties of these species are often inferred from MnIII&#8208;alkylperoxo analogues. In this study, we show that the reaction of the MnIII&#8208;hydroxo complex [MnIII(OH)(6Medpaq)]+ (1) with hydrogen peroxide and acid results in the formation of a dark&#8208;green MnIII&#8208;hydroperoxo species [MnIII(OOH)(6Medpaq)]+ (2). The formulation of 2 is based on electronic absorption, 1H&#8197;NMR, IR, and ESI&#8208;MS data. The thermal decay of 2 follows a first order process, and variable&#8208;temperature kinetic studies of the decay of 2 yielded activation parameters that could be compared with those of a MnIII&#8208;alkylperoxo analogue. Complex 2 reacts with the hydrogen&#8208;atom donor TEMPOH two&#8208;fold faster than the MnIII&#8208;hydroxo complex 1. Complex 2 also oxidizes PPh3, and this MnIII&#8208;hydroperoxo species is 600&#8208;fold more reactive with this substrate than its MnIII&#8208;alkylperoxo analogue [MnIII(OOtBu)(6Medpaq)]+. DFT and time&#8208;dependent (TD) DFT computations are used to compare the electronic structure of 2 with similar MnIII&#8208;hydroperoxo and MnIII&#8208;alkylperoxo complexes.

         <title>Axial Coordination Engineering on Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C Materials for Oxygen Reduction: Insights from Theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides theoretical insights into the oxygen reduction reaction process on the well&#8208;established FeN4 active center with different axial ligands and offers guidance for enhancing the electrocatalytic performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts by axial coordination engineering.







Abstract
Axial coordination engineering has emerged as an effective strategy to regulate the catalytic performance of metal&#8722;N&#8722;C materials for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the ORR mechanism and activity changes of their active centers modified by axial ligands are still unclear. Here, a comprehensive investigation of the ORR on a series of FeN4&#8722;L moieties (L stands for an axial ligand) is performed using advanced density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The axial ligand has a substantial effect on the electronic structure and catalytic activity of the FeN4 center. Specially, FeN4&#8722;C6H5 is screened as a promising active moiety with superior ORR activity, as further revealed by constant&#8208;potential calculations and kinetic analysis. The enhanced activity is attributed to the weakened *OH adsorption caused by the altered electronic structure. Moreover, microkinetic modeling shows that at pH=1, FeN4&#8722;C6H5 possesses an impressive theoretical half&#8208;wave potential of ~1.01&#8197;V, superior to the pristine Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts (~0.88&#8197;V) calculated at the same level. These findings advance the understanding of the ORR mechanism of FeN4&#8722;L and provide guidance for optimizing the ORR performance of single&#8208;metal&#8208;atom catalysts.

However, the ORR mechanism and activity changes of their active centers modified by axial ligands are still unclear. Here, a comprehensive investigation of the ORR on a series of FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;L moieties (L stands for an axial ligand) is performed using advanced density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The axial ligand has a substantial effect on the electronic structure and catalytic activity of the FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; center. Specially, FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is screened as a promising active moiety with superior ORR activity, as further revealed by constant-potential calculations and kinetic analysis. The enhanced activity is attributed to the weakened *OH adsorption caused by the altered electronic structure. Moreover, microkinetic modeling shows that at pH=1, FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; possesses an impressive theoretical half-wave potential of ~1.01&#8197;V, superior to the pristine Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts (~0.88&#8197;V) calculated at the same level. These findings advance the understanding of the ORR mechanism of FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;L and provide guidance for optimizing the ORR performance of single-metal-atom catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recognition&#8208;Encoded Molecules: A Minimal Self&#8208;Replicator</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A minimal donor&#8208;acceptor heterodimer, based on hydrogen bonding recognition, exhibits self&#8208;replicating behaviour through imine formation between aniline and aldehyde complementary monomers. This further suggests that the unique properties of nucleic acids can be paralleled by synthetic recognition&#8208;encoded molecules.







Abstract
Nucleic acids, with their unique duplex structure, which is key for information replication, have sparked interest in self&#8208;replication's role in life's origins. Early template&#8208;based replicators, initially built on short oligonucleotides, expanded to include peptides and synthetic molecules. We explore here the potential of a class of synthetic duplex&#8208;forming oligoanilines, as self&#8208;replicators. We have recently developed oligoanilines equipped with 2&#8208;trifluoromethylphenol&#8211;phosphine oxide H&#8208;bond base pairs and we investigate whether the imine formed between aniline and aldehyde complementary monomers can self&#8208;replicate. Despite lacking a clear sigmoidal kinetic profile, control experiments with a methylated donor and a competitive inhibitor support self&#8208;replication. Further investigations with the reduced aniline dimer demonstrate templated synthesis, revealing a characteristic parabolic growth. After showing sequence selective duplex formation, templated synthesis and the emergence of catalytic function, the self&#8208;replication behaviour further suggests that the unique properties of nucleic acids can be paralleled by synthetic recognition&#8208;encoded molecules.

         <title>3,3&#8208;Difluorooxetane&#8211;A Versatile Functional Group for Bioisosteric Replacements in Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3,3&#8208;Difluorooxetane (3,3&#8208;diFOx) is proposed as a promising functional group for drug discovery and other areas of science. Its applicability is confirmed by a comprehensive study of physicochemical, structural, electronic, and biological properties, assessing chemical stability, as well as multigram synthesis of corresponding building blocks. The compatibility with bioisosteric replacements is demonstrated for the case of tert&#8208;butyl group in the molecule of Tenovin&#8208;6, a known sirtuin inhibitor.







Abstract
Functional group (FG) is one of the cornerstone concepts in organic chemistry and related areas. The wide spread of bioisosterism ideas in medicinal chemistry and beyond caused a striking rise in demand for novel FGs with a defined impact on the developed compound properties. In this work, the evaluation of the 3,3&#8208;difluorooxetane unit (3,3&#8208;diFox) as a functional group for bioisosteric replacements is disclosed. A comprehensive experimental study (including multigram building block synthesis, quantification of steric and electronic properties, measurements of pKa, LogP, chemical stability, and biological evaluation of the 3,3&#8208;diFox&#8208;derived bioisostere of a drug candidate) revealed a prominent behavior of the 3,3&#8208;diFox fragment as a versatile substituent for early drug discovery programs.

         <title>Photoinduced Enantioselective Triplet Radical Reaction on Metal: Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Conjugate Addition of Acylsilanes to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketones and Aldehydes</title>

A photoinduced copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective conjugate addition of acylsilanes has been developed. The conjugate acylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones and aldehydes was promoted by a copper(I)/chiral NHC catalyst under photoirradiation for synthesizing 2&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds in enantioenriched forms. Mechanistic studies indicated a reaction mechanism involving copper&#8208;to&#8208;acyl charge transfer followed by an electronical and geometrical change to generate a &#946;&#8208;radical&#8208;C&#8208;enolate&#8208;Cu(II)&#8208;acyl complex.

A photoinduced copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective conjugate addition of acylsilanes has been developed. The conjugate acylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones and aldehydes was promoted by a copper(I)/chiral NHC catalyst under visible&#8208;light irradiation for synthesizing various 2&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds in enantioenriched forms. Mechanistic studies combining experiments and quantum chemical calculations indicated a reaction mechanism involving copper&#8208;to&#8208;acyl charge transfer (i.&#8201;e., metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT)) excitation of an alkene&#8208;bound acylcopper complex. The MLCT excitation is followed by an electronical and geometrical change to generate a triplet &#946;&#8208;radical&#8208;C&#8208;enolate&#8208;Cu(II)&#8208;acyl complex with an acyl radical character, which undergoes facile excited state C&#8722;C bond formation in the copper coordination sphere, affording the 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition product.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review summarizes the current research progresses of surface&#8208;synthesized magnetic carbon&#8208;based nanostructures. We mainly review the on&#8208;surface synthesis and characterization techniques, as well as the magnetism of nanographene and nanographene&#8208;based spin chains. Finally, we look forward to the improvement of experimental methods and the potential for future applications.







Abstract
The emergence of &#960;&#8208;magnetism in low&#8208;dimensional carbon&#8208;based nanostructures, such as nanographenes (NGs), has captured significant attention due to their unique properties and potential applications in spintronics and quantum technologies. Recent advancements in on&#8208;surface synthesis under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions have enabled the atomically precise engineering of these nanostructures, effectively overcoming the challenges posed by their inherent strong chemical reactivity. This review highlights the essential concepts and synthesis methods used in studying NGs. It also outlines the remarkable progress made in understanding and controlling their magnetic properties. Advanced characterization techniques, such as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM), have been instrumental in visualizing and manipulating these nanostructures, which highlighting their critical role in the field. The review underscores the versatility of carbon&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;magnetic materials and their potential for integration into next&#8208;generation electronic devices. It also outlines future research directions aimed at optimizing their synthesis and exploring applications in cutting&#8208;edge technologies.

         <dc:description>
Where do they go? A macrocycle consisting of four square planar platinum corners and twenty&#8208;four sp carbon atoms, the cavity of which has a markedly negative surface potential and engages in supramolecular chemistry, is treated with iodine. The platinum corners are converted to diiodide complexes. The fate of the carbon atoms is explored, and other preparative approaches to cyclo[24]carbon are reviewed.







Abstract
The overarching goal of this study is to effect the elimination of platinum from adducts with cis &#8211;C&#8801;C&#8722;Pt&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8208; linkages, thereby generating novel conjugated polyynes. Thus, the bis(hexatriynyl) complex trans&#8208;(p&#8208;tol3P)2Pt((C&#8801;C)3H)2 is treated with 1,3&#8208;diphosphines R2C(CH2PPh2)2 to generate (R2C(CH2PPh2)2)2Pt((C&#8801;C)3H)2 (14; R=c, n&#8208;Bu; e, p&#8208;tolCH2). These condense with the diiodide complexes R2C(CH2PPh2)2PtI2 (9&#8201;a,c) in the presence of CuI (cat.) and excess HNEt2 to give the title macrocycles [(R2C(CH2PPh2)2)Pt(C&#8801;C)3]4 (16&#8201;c,e) as adducts of the byproduct [H2NEt2]+ I&#8722; (30&#8211;66&#8201;%). DOSY NMR experiments establish that this association is maintained in solution, but NaOAc removes the ammonium salt. The bis(triethylsilylpolyynyl) complexes (n&#8208;Bu2C(CH2PPh2)2)Pt((C&#8801;C)nSiEt3)2 (n=2, 3) are synthesized analogously to 14&#8201;c. They react with I2 at rt to give mainly the diiodide complex 9&#8201;c and the coupling product Et3Si(C&#8801;CC&#8801;C)nSiEt3. The possibility of competing reactions giving IC&#8801;C species is investigated. Analogous reactions of the Pt4C24 macrocycle 16&#8201;c also give 9&#8201;c, but no sp 13C&#8197;NMR signals or mass spectrometric Cxz+ ions (x=24&#8211;100) could be detected. It is proposed that some cyclo[24]carbon is generated, but then rapidly converts to other forms of elemental carbon. No cyclotetracosane (C24H48) is detected when this sequence is carried out in the presence of PtO2 and H2.

&lt;p&gt;Where do they go? A macrocycle consisting of four square planar platinum corners and twenty-four sp carbon atoms, the cavity of which has a markedly negative surface potential and engages in supramolecular chemistry, is treated with iodine. The platinum corners are converted to diiodide complexes. The fate of the carbon atoms is explored, and other preparative approaches to cyclo[24]carbon are reviewed.

         <title>Indole Nucleophile Triggers Mechanistic Divergence in Ni&#8208;Photoredox N&#8208;Arylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study of a Ni&#8208;photoredox method for indole N&#8208;arylation unveils an intriguing effect of the nitrogen nucleophile on the reaction mechanism, that diverges from commonly proposed pathways and highlights the influence of X&#8208;type ligands on Ni oxidative addition rates.







Abstract
This study presents a Ni&#8208;photoredox method for indole N&#8208;arylation, broadening the range of substrates to include indoles with unprotected C3&#8208;positions and base&#8208;sensitive groups. Through detailed mechanistic inquiries, a Ni(I/III) mechanism was uncovered, distinct from those commonly proposed for Ni&#8208;catalyzed amine, thiol, and alcohol arylation, as well as from the Ni(0/II/III) cycle identified for amide arylation under almost identical conditions. The key finding is the formation of a Ni(I) intermediate bearing the indole nucleophile as a ligand prior to oxidative addition, which is rare for Ni&#8208;photoredox carbon&#8208;heteroatom coupling and has a profound impact on the reaction kinetics and scope. The pre&#8208;coordination of indole renders a more electron&#8208;rich Ni(I) intermediate, which broadens the scope by enabling fast reactivity even with challenging electron&#8208;rich aryl bromide substrates. Thus, this work highlights the often&#8208;overlooked influence of X&#8208;type ligands on Ni oxidative addition rates and illustrates yet another mechanistic divergence in Ni&#8208;photoredox C&#8208;heteroatom couplings.

         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;yielding, selective and scalable synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;cannabidiol (CBD) has been developed via a straightforward Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction of olivetol mediated by FeCl3. The synthetic CBD was employed for its encapsulation in solid and hollow pH&#8208; and temperature&#8208;sensitive nanoparticles, being evaluated their release, solubility, bioavailability and antitumoral properties of the resulting CBD&#8208;encapsulated nanosystems. Notably, the synthesized nanosystems displayed improved properties compared with free CBD, opening the doors towards therapeutically useful cannabinoid&#8208;based formulations.







Abstract
Cannabidiol (CBD) is garnering increasing interest due to its significant biological activity. This natural compound is one of the major cannabinoids in Cannabis sativa L. In this work, we describe the encapsulation of CBD in solid and hollow pH&#8208;sensitive poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) (solid@p4VP and hollow@p4VP) nanoparticles, and temperature&#8208;sensitive poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (solid@pNIPAM and hollow@pNIPAM) nanoparticles for transport and release CBD in a controlled manner. The CBD loading into these smart polymeric systems was effective and their release profiles, solubility and resistance to stomach and intestinal conditions were evaluated, showing satisfactory properties and improved bioavailability with respect to free CBD. Finally, the A549 human lung cancer cell line was used as lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cellular model to carry out preliminary assays of the in&#8197;vitro activity of the vehiculized CBD. For all these studies, synthetic CBD was employed, for which a new efficient and scalable synthesis of cannabinoids has been developed.

Cobalt&#8208;mediated oxidation of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dilithio&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;binaphthyl by ferrocenium salts afforded [6]cyclo&#8208;1,2&#8208;naphthylene, which exhibits blue circularly polarized luminescence at 383&#8197;nm, with a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 97&#8201;% and a |glum| factor of 7.2&#215;10&#8722;4.







Abstract
A one&#8208;pot procedure with cobalt&#8208;mediated oxidation of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dilithio&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;binaphthyl by ferrocenium salts afforded the chiral cyclic hexamer of naphthylene, [6]cyclo&#8208;1,2&#8208;naphthylene (1). The molecular structure of 1 was determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR analyses, revealing its cyclic structure with an approximate D3 symmetry. Compound 1 exhibits blue emission at 383&#8197;nm with high photoluminescence quantum yield of 97&#8201;%, which can be attributed to its rigid twelve&#8208;membered ring structure. Optical resolution of 1 by chiral HPLC allowed for the evaluation of its chiroptical properties. Each enantiomer exhibits circular dichroism with complex Cotton effects, which are grouped into three positive or three negative couplets. Circularly polarized luminescence is observed at 383&#8197;nm with an anisotropy factor |glum| on the order of 10&#8722;4. The high photoluminescence quantum yield and the CPL properties of 1 indicate its potential application as a CPL emitter.

Optical resolution of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; by chiral HPLC allowed for the evaluation of its chiroptical properties. Each enantiomer exhibits circular dichroism with complex Cotton effects, which are grouped into three positive or three negative couplets. Circularly polarized luminescence is observed at 383&#8197;nm with an anisotropy factor |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Biosynthesis of Nonribosomal Peptides Chitinimides Reveal a Special Type of Thioesterase Domains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biosynthetic investigation of the nonribosomal peptides chitinimides indicates the thioesterase domain ChmC&#8208;TE can recognize a small molecule methanol as well as a large X part for transesterification, completing the release of final products. This special type of TE domains harnesses a signature motif YNHNR for recognition of X part.







Abstract
Non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and their tailored enzymes have diverse biological functions. In this study, we investigated the biosynthesis and function of chitinimides, which belong to the non&#8208;ribosomal peptide (NRP) subfamily featuring a pyrrolidine&#8208;containing part (X part) connected to the polypeptide chain via an ester bond. A conserved gene cassette, chmHIJK, is responsible for oxyacylation of the pyrrolidine moiety in the X part. The thioesterase (TE) domain of ChmC (ChmC&#8208;TE) catalyzes transesterification reactions with a free X part or methanol as a nucleophilic reagent to form different chitinimides. The crucial amino acid residues in the ChmC&#8208;TE domains responsible for the specific recognition of the X part were identified, and they were conserved in all the biosynthetic pathways of this NRP subfamily to form a signature motif, YNHNR, suggesting a special type of TE domain in NRPSs. Chitinimides demonstrate the biological function of promoting the swarming ability of the native producer. This study provides deep insights into the biosynthesis of this special NRP subfamily, and shows that the special TE domain could be used to generate diverse NRPs by combinatorial biosynthesis.

         <title>Proton Conduction via Water and Ammonia Coordinated Metal Cationic Species in MOF and MHOF Platforms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemically robust proton&#8208;conducting materials, In&#8208;H2O&#8208;MOF and MHOF&#8208;4, having different solvent&#8208;coordinated metal cationic species (H2O and NH3) were rationally designed and synthesized to demonstrate their proton conduction achieved through coordinated polar protic solvents molecules.







Abstract
Although metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and metalo hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (MHOFs) are designed as promising solid&#8208;state proton conductors by incorporating various protonic species intrinsically or extrinsically, design and development of such materials by employing the concept of proton conduction through coordinated polar protic solvent is largely unexplored. Herein, we have constructed two proton&#8208;conducting materials having different solvent coordinated metal cationic species: In&#8208;H2O&#8208;MOF, ({[In(H2O)6][In3(Pzdc)6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;15H2O}n; H2Pzdc: pyrazine&#8208;2,3&#8208;dicarboxylic acid) with coordinated water molecules from hexaaquaindium cationic species, and MHOF&#8208;4, ([{Co(NH3)6}2(2,6&#8208;NDS)2(H2O)2]n; 2,6&#8208;H2NDS: 2,6&#8208;naphthalenedisulfonic acid) with coordinated ammonia from hexaammoniacobalt cationic species. Interestingly, higher proton conductivity was achieved for In&#8208;H2O&#8208;MOF (1.5&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) than MHOF&#8208;4 (6.3&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) under the extreme conditions (80&#8201;&#176;C and 95&#8201;% RH), which could be attributed to enhanced acidity of coordinated water molecules having much lower pKa value than that of coordinated ammonia. Greater charge polarization on hydrogen atoms of In3+&#8208;coordinated water molecules than that of Co2+&#8208;coordinated ammonia led to the high conductivity of In&#8208;H2O&#8208;MOF, as evident by quantum chemical studies. Such a comparative study on metal&#8208;coordinated protic polar solvents in achieving proton conduction in crystalline solids is yet to be made.

         <title>Two&#8208;Fold Oxidative Coupling of Furan with Indole Provides Modular Access to a New Class of Tetra&#8208;(Hetero)Arylated Furans with Up to Four Different Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first methodology for two&#8208;fold oxidative coupling on furan core is presented. The reaction is mediated by an earth&#8208;abundant Fe(III)&#8208;catalyst without the need for any ligand. The product bis(indolyl)furans represent a new class of &#8216;extremely congested&#8217; tetra&#8208;(hetero)arylated furans with propeller shape and displays unique aggregation&#8208;caused quenching properties of highly arylated furans.







Abstract
Highly arylated propeller&#8208;shaped heteroarenes constitute an intriguing class of molecular scaffolds for material science applications. Among these, tetraarylated furans demonstrate differentiated properties as compared to other similar heterocyclic cores. The synthetic complexity to access tetraarylated furans increases significantly with increasing number of different peripheral aryl groups. There are only a very limited number of methodologies available to access furans with four different (hetero)aryl substituents. Notably, none of these involve direct oxidative coupling on the furan core as the method of choice. Herein, we report the first methodology based on a sequential two&#8208;fold oxidative C&#8722;C coupling of furans with indoles to access bis(indolyl)furans (BIFs) &#8208; a new class of &#8216;extremely congested&#8217; tetra&#8208;(hetero)arylated furans with up to four different substituents. The reaction is mediated by inexpensive, earth&#8208;abundant FeCl3&#8901;6H2O and displays high efficiency, wide substrate scope, modularity and aqueous compatibility. Moreover, we also present the first validation of the distinct aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) property of the tetraarylated furans beyond only phenyls as peripheral groups and disclose new mechanistic underpinnings for the same.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Three&#8208;Component Reaction for the Construction Of &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Amino Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective photochemical three&#8208;component synthesis is presented for the construction of valuable &#945;&#8208;tertiary amino acid structures, leveraging alkyl radicals generated through a light&#8208;induced halogen atom transfer (XAT) process to create a mild reaction environment. The excellent functional group tolerance and the potential for late&#8208;stage modification of the products further underscore the practical utility and versatility of this approach.







Abstract
The synthesis of &#945;&#8208;tertiary amino acids (ATAAs), which are pivotal components in natural metabolism and pharmaceutical innovation, continues to attract significant research interest. Despite substantial advancements, the pursuit of a facile, versatile, and resource&#8208;efficient methodology remains an area of active development. In this work, we introduce a visible light&#8208;triggered three&#8208;component reaction involving readily available nitrosoarenes, N&#8208;acyl pyrazoles, and allyl or (bromomethyl)benzenes under mild conditions. This approach enables the straightforward assembly of a wide array of ATAA derivatives (42 examples) in commendably high yields (up to 89&#8201;%). Mechanistic investigations elucidate that the reaction proceeds through a dehydration condensation between nitrosoarenes and N&#8208;acyl pyrazoles to generate ketimine intermediates. This is followed by a light&#8208;driven halogen atom transfer (XAT) process and a radical addition, culminating in the formation of the desired products. The approach showcases excellent functional group compatibility and late&#8208;stage derivatization potential, offering new insights and avenues for the synthesis of ATAA analogs.

         <title>Dynamic Luminescence Vapochromism of Pyridinium&#8208;Based Organic Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three novel luminescent organic salts with pyridinium&#8208;based cations were synthesized and characterized in detail. Their good thermal stability, outstanding photophysical properties, and dynamic vapochromic response to certain solvent vapors were demonstrated. In particular, (CzPy)Cl showed rapid luminescence vapochromism with a drastic shift in emission color, achieved by careful crystal engineering.







Abstract
Organic vapochromic materials which undergo a drastic change in their photophysical properties upon exposure to vapors or gases are attracting growing scientific attention because of their low price and wide range of possible applications. In this work, luminescence vapochromism of carbazole&#8208;pyridinium&#8208;based organic salts with a general structure of (CzPy)X (CzPy+=2,3&#8208;di(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)pyridinium ion; X=Cl, Br or I) is reported. It was found that (CzPy)X compounds form J&#8208;aggregates, which rearranged back to monomeric form upon exposure to methanol, ethanol, acetone, and water vapors. In contrast, acetonitrile was found to promote the J&#8208;aggregation in (CzPy)X compounds by occupying the voids in their crystal lattice and pushing cations closer together. It was further demonstrated that the efficiency of J&#8208;aggregation in (CzPy)X compounds depends on the size of the anion, which was employed to realize dynamic luminescence vapochromism, with vapochromic response times ranging from a couple of minutes in (CzPy)Cl to more than an hour in (CzPy)I. In addition, (CzPy)X compounds exhibited high melting points of about 250&#8201;&#176;C and excellent thermal stability. (CzPy)Cl and (CzPy)Br have also shown good photoluminescence quantum yields at room temperature in a solid state.

         <title>Luminescence Changeable CO2&#8208;Storage Cylinder: Triple&#8208;Stranded Helical Eu(III)/Tb(III) Fluorinated MOFs with Amide Linkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel lanthanide MOFs with CO2 gas adsorption are demonstrated. The MOFs constructed a cylindrical structure. The inner channel of the cylindrical structure was covered with fluorine atoms. The fluorine atoms enhance interaction with CO2 gas molecules. Eu/Tb&#8208;mixed MOFs exhibited the change of ratiometric emission intensity between Eu and Tb by CO2 gas adsorption behavior.







Abstract
Triple&#8208;stranded helical lanthanide MOFs with CO2 adsorption properties were investigated. Lanthanide MOFs ([Eu0.1Tb0.9(hfa)3(dpa)]n) are composed of lanthanide luminophores (Eu(III) and/or Tb(III) ions), fluorinated antenna ligands (hfa: hexafluoroacetylacetonate), and polyamide&#8208;type linker ligands (dpa: 4&#8208;(diphenylphosphoryl)&#8208;N&#8208;(4&#8208;(diphenylphosphoryl)phenyl)benzamide). The cylindrical structure was characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, and gas adsorption measurements. The inner surfaces of the cylindrical channels were covered with the fluorine atoms of the hfa ligands. The emission intensity ratio (IEu/ITb) in [Eu0.1Tb0.9(hfa)3(dpa)]n is affected by the CO2 gas adsorption behavior. The change in IEu/ITb value was caused by the intermolecular interactions between the CO2 gas molecules and the fluorinated ligands, resulting in an electronic structural change of the lowest triplet excited state in the photosensitized hfa ligands.

         <dc:description>Inhibition of amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) aggregation and cholinesterase activity are two major therapeutic targets for Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD). Multifunctional Molecules (MFMs) specifically designed to address other contributing factors, such as metal ion induced abnormalities, oxidative stress, toxic Ab aggregates etc. are very much required. Several multifunctional molecules have been developed using different molecular scaffolds. Reported herein is a new series of four MFMs based on ThT, Azo&#8208;stilbene and metal ion chelating pockets. The synthesis, characterization, and metal chelation ability for [Cu(II) and Zn(II)] are presented herein. Furthermore, we explored their multifunctionality w.r.t. to their (i) recognition of A&#946; aggregates and monomeric form, (ii) utility in modulating the aggregation pathways of both metal&#8208;free and metal&#8208;bound amyloid&#8208;&#946;, (iii) ex&#8208;vivo staining of amyloid plaques in 5xFAD mice brain sections, (iv) ability to scavenge free radicals and (v) ability to inhibit cholinesterase activity. Molecular docking studies were also performed with A&#946; peptides and acetylcholinesterase enzyme to understand the observed inhibitory effect on activity. Overall, the studies presented here establish the multifunctional nature of these molecules and qualify them as promising candidates for furthermore investigation in the quest for finding Alzheimer&#8217;s disease treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancement of Effective Energy Barrier and Magnetic Blocking Temperature in Tetraoxolene Radical Coupled Dinuclear Dysprosium Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chloranilate radical bridged Dy2&#8208;SMM molecule shows the highest thermal energy barrier amongst the radical bridged Dy(III) SMMs. The ferromagnetic coupling between the lanthanide ions enhances the blocking temperature to &#8764;7&#8197;K.







Abstract
A well&#8208;judged combination of a high axial ligand field and a bridging radical ligand in a dinuclear lanthanide complex provides a single&#8208;molecule magnet with a higher effective energy barrier for magnetic relaxation and blocking temperature compared to its non&#8208;radical analog due to significant magnetic exchange coupling between radical and Ln(III) ions. In this work, we report two chloranilate (CA) bridged dinuclear dysprosium complexes, [{(bbpen)Dy(&#956;2&#8208;CA)Dy(bbpen)}] (1Dy) and [{(bbpen)Dy(&#956;2&#8208;CA&#8901;)Dy(bbpen)}&#8722;{CoCp2}+] (2Dy), where 2Dy is the radical bridged Dy&#8208;complex obtained via the chemical reduction of bridging CA moiety (H2bbpen=N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;hydroxybenzyl)&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;methylpyridyl)ethylenediamine). The presence of high electronegative phenoxide moiety enhances the axial anisotropy of pseudo&#8208;square antiprismatic Dy(III) ions. The diffused spin of radical is efficiently coupled with anisotropic Dy(III) centres and decreases the quantum tunnelling of magnetization (QTM) in the magnetic relaxation process. The magnetic relaxation of 1Dy follows Orbach, Raman, and QTM processes whereas for 2Dy it follows Orbach and Raman Processes. Due to less involvement of the QTM relaxation process, 2Dy shows a higher thermal energy barrier (Ueff=700&#8197;K) and a high blocking temperature (6.7&#8197;K), compared to its non&#8208;radical analog. Remarkably, the radical coupled 2Dy complex shows the highest energy barrier among the radical bridged Dy(III)&#8208;based SMMs to date.

Abstract
We have developed a gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction of aryldiynes bearing a hydrosilyl group to afford a variety of unexplored 5H&#8208;benzo[b]indeno[2,1&#8208;d]silines. The reaction system is applicable to the synthesis of bidirectionally &#960;&#8208;extended silacycles from tetra(alkynyl)aryl compounds. Computational studies suggest that 5H&#8208;benzo[b]indeno[2,1&#8208;d]silines are formed via the insertion of a vinyl carbocation intermediate into the Si&#8722;H bond.

Abstract
Herein, we report a mechanistic investigation of a recently developed electrochemical method for the deconstructive methoxylation of arylalcohols. A combination of synthetic, electroanalytical, and computational experiments have been performed to gain a deeper understanding of the reaction mechanism and the structural requirements for fragmentation to occur. It was found that 2&#8208;arylalcohols undergo anodic oxidation to form the corresponding aromatic radical cations, which fragment to form oxocarbenium ions and benzylic radical intermediates via mesolytic cleavage, with further anodic oxidation and trapping of the benzylic carbocation with methanol to generate the observed methyl ether products. It was also found that the electrochemical fragmentation of 2&#8208;arylalkanols is promoted by structural features that stabilize the oxocarbenium ions and/or benzylic radical intermediates formed upon mesolytic cleavage of the aromatic radical cations. With an enhanced understanding of the reaction mechanism and the structural features that promote fragmentation, it is anticipated that alternative electrosynthetic transformations will be developed that utilize this powerful, yet underdeveloped, mode of substrate activation.

         <title>C&#8722;H Activation and Hydrogen Isotope Exchange of Aryl Carbamates Using Iridium(I) Complexes Bearing Chelating NHC&#8208;Phosphine Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium(I) complex bearing a chelating N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;phosphine ligand catalyzes hydrogen isotope exchange directed by the bulky tert&#8208;butyl carbamate group. A range of aniline derivatives are labelled with high deuterium incorporation, and the method is extended to O&#8208;aryl carbamates. Computational and experimental mechanistic studies reveal distinct differences in the catalytic cycle compared to the corresponding monodentate N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene/phosphine catalysts.







Abstract
Hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) via C&#8722;H activation constitutes an efficient method for the synthesis of isotopically&#8208;enriched compounds, which are crucial components of the drug discovery process and are extensively employed in mechanistic studies. A series of iridium(I) complexes, bearing a chelating phosphine&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand, was designed and synthesized for application in the catalytic HIE of challenging N&#8208; and O&#8208;aryl carbamates. A broad range of substrates were labeled efficiently, and applicability to biologically&#8208;relevant systems was demonstrated by labeling an &#671;&#8208;tyrosine&#8208;derived carbamate with excellent levels of deuterium incorporation. Combined theoretical and experimental studies unveiled intriguing mechanistic features within this process, in comparison to C&#8722;H activation and hydrogen isotope exchange catalyzed by monodentate Ir(I) NHC/phosphine complexes.

         <title>Highly Efficient Detection of Pd2+ in Aqueous Medium by an Elusive Mn(II) Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient and selective detection of Pd2+ in aqueous medium with exceptionally low limit of detection (LOD) within wide ranges of pH and higher binding constant values by a newly designed Mn(II) based 1D coordination polymer.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of a Mn(II)&#8208;based coordination polymer (CP); and its structure, phase consistency and thermal stability have been established by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD), powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and thermalgravimetric analysis (TGA) respectively. This is the first example of paramgnetic Mn(II)&#8208;based CP that acts as pH&#8208;dependent emitting material [&#955;em=525&#8197;nm (pH=2.0&#8211;4.0) and 450&#8197;nm (pH=5.0&#8211;12.0)]. Its emission is quenched by Pd2+ in aqueous medium in presence of other thirteen cations with reasonably low pH&#8208;dependent limits of detection (LODs) [21.178&#8197;ppb (pH=3), 15.005&#8197;ppb (pH=7.0) and 59.940&#8197;ppb (pH=10.0)] as described by well&#8208;established mechanism. Therefore, urgency of such stable sensor remains high in regard to the environmental pollution.

Therefore, urgency of such stable sensor remains high in regard to the environmental pollution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Decarboxylative Alkylation of Carboxylic Acids with Easily Oxidizable Functional Groups Catalyzed by an Imidazole&#8208;Coordinated Fe3 Cluster under Visible Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a new photo&#8208;catalyst system for decarboxylation of phenol and indole&#8208;containing carboxylic acids in the presence of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes, leading to decarboxylative alkylation products by imidazole&#8208;coordinated Fe3 cluster under visible light irradiation. Various N&#8208;protected amino acids and heterocycle&#8208;containing aliphatic carboxylic acids were applicable in this catalytic transformation.







Abstract
Decarboxylative alkylation of carboxylic acids with easily oxidizable functional groups such as phenol and indole functionalities was achieved using a catalytic amount of basic iron(III) acetate, Fe(OAc)2(OH), in the presence of benzimidazole under 427&#8197;nm LED irradiation. Kinetic analyses of this catalytic reaction revealed that the reaction rate is first&#8208;order in alkenes and is linearly correlated with the light intensity; the faster reaction rate for the benzimidazole&#8208;ligated species was consistent with the increased absorbance in the visible light region. Wide functional group tolerance for the easily oxidizable groups is ascribed to the weak oxidation ability of the in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated oxo&#8208;bridged iron clusters compared with other iron(III) species.

         <title>Dimensionally Extending from 1D MX&#8211;Chain to Ladder and Nanotube Systems: Structural and Electronic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in dimensionally extending MX&#8208;chains from 1D chains to various ladders and nanotubes are reviewed, from the viewpoints of structural and electronic properties. The dimensional extension of MX&#8208;chains can not only modulate interchain coupling and electronic properties, but also provide nanoscale confinement space for studying transport dynamics, thus providing insights into the next&#8208;generation of nanoelectronics.







Abstract
Molecular one&#8208;dimensional (1D) electron systems have attracted much attention due to their unique electronic state, physical and chemical properties derived from high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio structures. Among 1D materials, mixed&#8208;valence halogen&#8208;bridged transition&#8208;metal chain complexes (MX&#8208;chains) based on coordination assemblies are currently of particular interest because their electronic properties, such as mixed&#8208;valence state and band gap, can be controlled by substituting components and varying configurations. In particular, chemistry has recently noted that dimensionally extending MX&#8208;chains through organic rung ligands can introduce and modulate electronic coupling of metal atoms between chains, i.&#8201;e., interchain interactions. In this review, for the first time, we highlight the recent progress on MX systems from the viewpoint of dimensionally extending from 1D chain to ladder and nanotube, mainly involving structural design and electronic properties. Overall, dimensional extension can not only tune the electronic properties of MX&#8208;chain, but also build the unique platform for studying transport dynamics in confined space, such as proton conduction. Based on these features, we envision that the MX&#8208;chain systems provide valuable insights into deep understanding of 1D electron systems, as well as the potential applications such as nanoelectronics.

         <title>Isonitrile Photochemistry: A Functional Group Class Coming in from the Cold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isonitriles, often neglected for their unpleasant smell, have fascinated many generations of chemists thanks to unique reactivity modes. The present concept article, by retracing the seeds of isonitrile photochemistry, points out the hidden opportunities offered by visible light photo(redox) catalysis to promote key advancements in the field.







Abstract
Starting from a historical background that acknowledges isonitriles as a neglected class of compounds due to their unpleasant smell and hardly controlled reaction conditions with open shell species, the present concept article aims at highlighting the seeds of the modern isonitrile photochemistry. Representative essential transformations achieved via either UV light irradiation or radical initiators at high temperatures are brought into play to draw a parallel with the current literature relying on the exploitation of visible light photochemical methods. Such a comparison points out the potential of this enabling technology to further expand the scope of isonitrile chemistry and the unmet challenges which makes it a very stimulating field.

         <title>An Electrosynthesis of 1,3,4&#8208;Oxadiazoles from N&#8208;Acyl Hydrazones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The indirect electrochemical oxidative cyclisation of N&#8208;acyl hydrazones offers an efficient approach to access 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazoles, an important motif in medicinal chemistry. The DABCO&#8208;mediated reaction enables the selective synthesis of a broad range of these valuable heterocycles from readily available aldehydes and hydrazides.







Abstract
The 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole is a widely encountered motif in the areas of pharmaceuticals, materials, and agrochemicals. This work has established a mediated electrochemical synthesis of 2,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazoles from N&#8208;acyl hydrazones. Using DABCO as the optimal redox mediator has enabled a mild oxidative cyclisation, without recourse to stoichiometric oxidants. In contrast to previous methods, this indirect electrochemical oxidation has enabled a broad range of substrates to be accessed, with yields of up to 83&#8201;%, and on gram scale. The simplicity of the method has been further demonstrated by the development of a one&#8208;pot procedure, directly transforming readily available aldehydes and hydrazides into valuable heterocycles.

         <title>Amplifying Reactivity of Bio&#8208;Inspired [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase Mimics by Organic Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bio&#8208;inspired [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase mimic immobilized in polyaniline nanotubes catalyzes hydrogen evolution at neutral pH under aerobic conditions, achieving enhanced activity with reduced overpotentials and increased current densities compared to the mimic alone.







Abstract
A bio&#8208;inspired FeFe hydrogenase model which catalyses hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic solutions is immobilized in polyaniline (PANI)&#8208;based nanotubes. A combination of analytical techniques reveals that this construct maintains both the molecular signatures of the bio&#8208;inspired complex and the material properties of PANI. The amine and imine&#8208;rich environment of the PANI chain amplifies the inherent HER activity of the bio&#8208;inspired complex, allowing electrocatalytic HER at neutral pH, with lower overpotentials and higher current densities compared to the bio&#8208;inspired complex alone. This construct retains the oxygen stability of the bio&#8208;inspired complex and remains stable through several hours of aerobic electrolysis, producing only 6.5&#8201;% H&#8322;O&#8322; from the competing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

Herein, we report a simple and efficient Rh2(OAc)4/XantPhos catalyzed a stereoselective hydrosilylation of alkynes. Mechanistic studies indicated that the formation of (Z)&#8208;selective hydrosilylation of alkyne proceeded via zwitterionic carbene species while (E)&#8208;selectivity was generated by the isomerization catalyzed by rhodium hydride species.







Abstract
A concise hydrosilylation of alkynes for synthesizing &#946;&#8208;(E)&#8208;vinylsilanes catalyzed by dirhodium(II)/XantPhos has been developed. In this reaction, &#946;&#8208;(E)&#8208;vinylsilanes were generated from the isomerization of &#946;&#8208;(Z)&#8208;vinylsilanes catalyzed by dirhodium(II) hydride species rather than the direct insertion of triple bond into M&#8722;H or M&#8722;Si bond (traditional Chalk&#8208;Harrod mechanism or modified Chalk&#8208;Harrod mechanism). The hydrosilylation displayed a broad substrate scope for alkynes and tertiary silanes, tolerating diverse functional groups including halides, nitriles, amines, esters, and heterocycles.

         <title>Highly efficient and selective synthesis of renewable isoprene over Mo&#8208;Fe&#8208;O and MgO/Mg(OH)2 composite catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of renewable isoprene continues to attract significant interest, yet catalysts still need improvement for industrial applications. We report herein an efficient and novel Prins tandem approach for highly selective production of isoprene from bio&#8208;based methanol and isobutene over Mo&#8208;Fe&#8208;O and MgO/Mg(OH)2 acid&#8208;base bifunctional catalysts. Hydration decreases the number of strong basic sites O2&#8208; ions and increases OH groups over MgO, thus improving the isoprene selectivity. Basic OH on Mg(OH)2 promotes the Prins condensation of formaldehyde and isobutene, while acidic OH promotes dehydration of isoprenol to isoprene. Suitable contents and proportions of basic and acidic OH groups over Mg(OH)2 increase isoprene selectivity and methanol conversion to 90 and 92% on the Mo&#8208;Fe&#8208;O+Mg(OH)2 composite catalysts, respectively. It exhibits good recycling stability, with isoprene selectivity remaining 90% after five successive regenerations. DFT calculations reveal OH groups formed after hydration reduce the energy barrier of the H transfer step, thereby promoting the overall reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocycle&#8208;Substituted Hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes with Windmill Architectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the synthesis and computational investigation of N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;substituted hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs). Following our method for the preparation of thioether&#8208;substituted HBCs, we prepared pyrrole&#8208;, indole&#8208;, carbazole&#8208;, and 1H&#8208;benz[g]indole&#8208;substituted HBCs from the corresponding fluorinated precursors under microwave irradiation. A series of polysubstituted benzoindole&#8208;HBCs with windmill architectures was also synthesized using the polyfluorinated HBC analogs. Due to the circular arrangement of the benzoindole moiety, the attachment of multiple substituents results in the presence of multiple conformers at room temperature. The rotation barrier can be overcome by heating the compounds to 323&#8208;333 K. Additionally, the investigation of the relaxed geometries shows two &#960;&#8208;stacking motifs within the conformers. Similar to the thioether substituted HBCs, the nature of the heterocycle does not influence the optoelectronic properties of the HBC core. The attachment of multiple benzoindole substituents leads to a bathochromic shift of the absorption and emission spectra, comparable to our previous studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;alternant Benzodifluoranthene Tetraimides from 7,8,9,10&#8208;Fluoranthene Diimides: Synthesis, Structure, and Optical&#8208;Limiting Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel tetraimide&#8208;functionalized non&#8208;alternant &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, namely, benzodifluoranthene tetraimides (BDFTI), has been designed and synthesized through highly efficient UV&#8208;photocyclization of a vinyl&#8208;bridged fluoranthene diimide dimer (i.e., FDI&#8208;V). The synthesis of FDI&#8208;V starts from a straightforward three&#8208;step route to produce novel 7,8,9,10&#8208;fluoranthene diimide (FDIs) building&#8208;blocks, followed by nearly complete bromination and then Stille&#8208;coupling reaction to give the desired dimer. The analysis by X&#8208;ray crystallography confirms a near&#8208;coplanar geometry for FDIs, while BDFTI shows a U&#8208;shaped and distorted backbone configuration proven by theoretical optimizations. The tetraimide BDFTI exhibits several advantages over the FDI cores, including an extended absorption band and a red&#8208;shift in photoluminescence spectra. This enhancement can be attributed to the presence of additional electron&#8208;deficient imide units, which promotes increased intramolecular charge transfer and improved electron affinity. All the imides show a local aromatic characteristic owing to the incorporation of pentagon rings in the &#960;&#8208;frameworks. The fully fused BDFTI exhibits nonlinear optical properties as analyzed by the open&#8208;aperture Z&#8208;scan technique, demonstrating superior optical&#8208;limiting performance compared to vinyl&#8208;bridged FDI&#8208;V. The versatile UV&#8208;photocyclization chemistries provide a pathway for developing complex and unique multiimide&#8208;functionalized &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems, paving the way for creating high&#8208;performance optical&#8208;limiting materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Developing efficient and durable non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts for high current&#8208;density hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) is a pressing requirement for commercial industrial electrolyzers. In this study, a vertical 1T'&#8208;ReSe2@2H&#8208;MoSe2 van der Waals heterostructure was developed through interface engineering to enhance the advantages of each component and expose numerous active sites.

         <title>Formation to Transportation: En&#8208;Route Fission&#8208;Facilitated Formation of Spheres in a Phosphorus&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymer for Transportation of Iodine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The capture and utilization of radioactive iodine using a single material is challenging. In this study, a C=C linked phosphine&#8208;containing porous organic polymer, PKPOP, is used for iodine transportation. The material efficiently captures gaseous iodine under ambient conditions and releases it in a controlled manner in both batch and flow conditions.







Abstract
Despite its potential as a clean power source to meet rising electricity demands, nuclear energy generates radioactive waste, including isotopes of iodine, that pose significant environmental and health risks. There is a growing demand to capture radioactive iodine and repurpose it effectively. However, achieving this dual functionality with a single material remains a significant challenge. This study explores phosphorus&#8208;based porous organic polymers (P&#8208;POPs) as probes for these dual functionalities. By employing 4&#8208;formyl(triphenyl)phosphine (BB1) and phenyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diacetonitrile (BB2) under the Knoevenagel polycondensation method, P&#8208;POPs (PKPOPs) have been synthesized that exhibit a smooth spherical morphology, which efficiently capture and release iodine under ambient conditions, facilitating efficient transportation of molecular iodine. This novel approach aims to potentially transform nuclear waste into valuable organic feedstock via an iodination reaction. The innovative application of PKPOP has also been demonstrated for iodination reactions using ball mills and under continuous flow conditions, showcasing its potential for safer waste management and utilization.

         <title>Copper Complexes with Protein&#8208;Based N&#8208;Donor Ligands as cis&#8208;Selective Nascent Cyclopropanases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stepwise repurposing of the first and second coordination spheres in cupin proteins yielded novel copper cupin complexes that could catalyze diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective cyclopropanation reactions via copper carbene species using ethyl diazoacetate. Even when employing t&#8208;butyl diazoacetate which is too bulky to produce the cis&#8208;cyclopropane, these nascent cyclopropanases exhibited thermodynamically unfavorable cis&#8208;preference.







Abstract
In this study, we aimed to develop protein&#8208;based metal ligands to catalyze cis&#8208;selective cyclopropanation using the TM1459 cupin protein superfamily. Copper complexes with TM1459 mutants containing the 3&#8208;His metal&#8208;binding site exhibited excellent diastereoselectivity in cyclopropanation reactions with styrene and ethyl diazoacetate. Further mutations in the secondary coordination sphere increased the cis&#8208;preference with t&#8208;butyl diazoacetate as the substrate with up to 80&#8201;:&#8201;20 (cis:trans ratio) and high enantioselectivity (90&#8201;% ee).

         <title>Investigations of Crucial Factors for the Non&#8208;Covalent Functionalization of Black Phosphorus (BP) using Perylene Diimide Derivatives for the Passivation of BP Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perylene diimides have been used for passivating black phosphorus, however, a concrete set of tools for fine&#8208;tuning such an interaction remains elusive. Therefore, ten different PDIs were investigated. It could be shown, that especially water&#8211;soluble PDIs provide reliable functionalization and stabilizing capabilities as they passivate BP up to 35&#8197;days.







Abstract
The non&#8208;covalent functionalization of black phosphorus (BP) was studied with a scope of ten tailor&#8208;made perylene diimides (PDIs). A combination of UV/Vis&#8208;, fluorescence&#8208;, as well as Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy was used to investigate the structural factors, which contribute to a pronounced PDI&#8208;BP interaction and thus support the protection of BP nanosheets against oxidative degradation. We were able to show, that water&#8208;soluble, amphiphilic PDIs with highly charged head groups can be used for the non&#8208;covalent functionalization of BP in aqueous media. Here, based on the hydrophobic effect, an efficient adsorption of the respective PDI molecules takes place and leads to the formation of a passivating film, yielding a considerable stabilization of the BP flakes under ambient conditions exceeding 30&#8197;days.

         <title>Stable Antiaromatic [16]Triphyrin(2.1.1) with Core Modification: Synthesis Using a 16&#960; Electrocyclic Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first stable antiaromatic trioxa[16]triphyrin(2.1.1) was synthesized and characterized using a core modification strategy. The synthesis involves a key intermediate, dihydrotrioxatriphyrin(2.1.1), formed via a rare 16&#960; electrocyclic reaction. The nearly planar structure and small HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap of trioxa[16]triphyrin(2.1.1) were consistent with its antiaromatic nature. Trioxa[16]triphyrin(2.1.1) exhibited antiaromaticity&#8211;aromaticity switching.







Abstract
Antiaromatic porphyrinoids have attracted significant attention owing to their unique electronic properties and potential applications. However, synthesis of antiaromatic contracted porphyrinoids is challenging owing to the inherent instability associated with smaller ring sizes. In this study, we report the synthesis and characterization of the first stable trioxa[16]triphyrin(2.1.1), a novel 16&#960; antiaromatic contracted porphyrinoid. We utilized a core modification approach to stabilize the [16]triphyrin(2.1.1). X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis revealed a nearly planar structure. Electrochemical studies demonstrated reversible oxidation behavior and a small HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, which was consistent with its antiaromatic nature. Chemical oxidation yielded an aromatic [14]triphyrin(2.1.1) dication, highlighting the antiaromaticity&#8211;aromaticity switching capability of this system. This synthesis involved the discovery of a key intermediate, dihydrotrioxatriphyrin(2.1.1), which underwent oxidative dehydrogenation to yield the target compound. Theoretical calculations suggested that dihydrotrioxatriphyrin(2.1.1) formed via a rare 16&#960; electrocyclic reaction. The successful synthesis and characterization of this stable trioxa[16]triphyrin(2.1.1) underscores the potential of the core modification strategies for the rational design of novel antiaromatic systems with tunable properties. Moreover, the discovery of the rare 16&#960; electrocyclic reaction advances the understanding of high&#8208;order pericyclic processes and may inspire new synthetic strategies for complex macrocyclic compounds.

         <title>High Yield of L&#8208;Sorbose via D&#8208;Glucose Isomerization in Ethanol over a Bifunctional Titanium&#8208;Boron&#8208;Beta Zeolite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifunctional Ti&#8208;B&#8208;Beta zeolite is demonstrated to be an efficient catalyst for sorbose production via glucose isomerization. Ethanol directs the conformation of glucose, facilitating its selective isomerization to sorbose and enables this isomerization to surpass the thermodynamic equilibrium limit by engaging in reactions with the resultant sorbose.







Abstract
D&#8208;Glucose&#8208;to&#8208;L&#8208;sorbose isomerization on Lewis acidic zeolite is a highly attractive avenue for sorbose production. But the L&#8208;sorbose yield is limited by the competing D&#8208;glucose&#8208;to&#8208;D&#8208;fructose isomerization and reaction equilibrium. In this work, it is suggested that ethanol directs the glucose conformation for selective D&#8208;glucose&#8208;to&#8208;L&#8208;sorbose isomerization. It also reacts with the produced L&#8208;sorbose to form ethyl&#8208;sorboside, which allows the D&#8208;glucose&#8208;to&#8208;L&#8208;sorbose isomerization to proceed beyond the thermodynamic equilibrium limit. It is shown that a bifunctional zeolite Beta containing framework titanium (Ti) and boron (B) is a selective catalyst for this tandem reaction: Lewis acidic framework Ti catalyzes the D&#8208;glucose&#8208;to&#8208;L&#8208;sorbose isomerization via an intramolecular 5,1&#8208;hydride shift process as confirmed by isotopic tracing experiments followed by 13C&#8208;NMR, while weak Br&#248;nsted acid framework B selectively promotes the sorbose ketalization with ethanol. A remarkably high yield of L&#8208;sorbose with a high fraction of sugar (&gt;95&#8201;%: 27&#8201;% unreacted glucose, 11.4&#8201;% fructose, 57&#8201;% sorbose) was obtained after the mixture produced in ethanol was hydrolyzed.

         <title>Bis&#8208;Squaramide&#8208;Based [2]Rotaxane Hosts for Anion Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating two squaramide motifs into the axle component of [2]rotaxanes dramatically enhances their anion binding affinities and selectivity properties compared to a mono&#8208;squaramide axle containing [2]rotaxane, revealing a rare anti&#8208;Hofmeister halide anion binding trend in aqueous&#8208;organic solvent media. Varying the rigidity of the linker connecting the axle squaramides results in the rotaxanes displaying strong and selective binding of tetrahedral and trigonal oxoanions.







Abstract
The first examples of bis&#8208;squaramide axle containing [2]rotaxanes linked via rigid aryl and flexible alkyl spacers synthesised using copper(I) catalysed active metal template methodology are reported. The halide and oxoanion binding properties of the [2]rotaxanes in aqueous&#8208;organic solvent media are examined through extensive 1H&#8208;NMR titration experiments to investigate the impact of integrating multiple squaramide motifs on the anion binding capabilities of the interlocked receptors. These studies reveal that the bis&#8208;squaramide rotaxane host systems exhibit enhanced halide anion binding capabilities relative to a mono&#8208;squaramide axle functionalised rotaxane, demonstrating a rare anti&#8208;Hofmeister bias halide anion selectivity trend in aqueous&#8208;organic mixtures and highlighting the efficacy of the potent solvent shielded hydrophobic interlocked binding pocket created upon mechanical bond formation. Notably, employing a rigid aryl linker between the two squaramide motifs in the axle component enables the rotaxane host to exhibit strong and selective binding of tetrahedral oxoanions. Conversely, a flexible alkyl spacer facilitates trigonal oxoanion selective recognition by the bis&#8208;squaramide [2]rotaxane.

&lt;p&gt;Incorporating two squaramide motifs into the axle component of [2]rotaxanes dramatically enhances their anion binding affinities and selectivity properties compared to a mono-squaramide axle containing [2]rotaxane, revealing a rare anti-Hofmeister halide anion binding trend in aqueous-organic solvent media. Varying the rigidity of the linker connecting the axle squaramides results in the rotaxanes displaying strong and selective binding of tetrahedral and trigonal oxoanions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first examples of bis-squaramide axle containing [2]rotaxanes linked &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; rigid aryl and flexible alkyl spacers synthesised using copper(I) catalysed active metal template methodology are reported. The halide and oxoanion binding properties of the [2]rotaxanes in aqueous-organic solvent media are examined through extensive &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR titration experiments to investigate the impact of integrating multiple squaramide motifs on the anion binding capabilities of the interlocked receptors. These studies reveal that the bis-squaramide rotaxane host systems exhibit enhanced halide anion binding capabilities relative to a mono-squaramide axle functionalised rotaxane, demonstrating a rare anti-Hofmeister bias halide anion selectivity trend in aqueous-organic mixtures and highlighting the efficacy of the potent solvent shielded hydrophobic interlocked binding pocket created upon mechanical bond formation. Notably, employing a rigid aryl linker between the two squaramide motifs in the axle component enables the rotaxane host to exhibit strong and selective binding of tetrahedral oxoanions. Conversely, a flexible alkyl spacer facilitates trigonal oxoanion selective recognition by the bis-squaramide [2]rotaxane.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>IPr*F &#8211; Highly Hindered, Fluorinated N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new class of sterically&#8208;hindered, fluorinated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes that are characterized by unique steric and electronic properties. An efficient, one&#8208;pot synthesis of IPr*F ligands is presented, enabling broad access of academic and industrial researchers to the fluorinated ligands. We anticipate that this novel class of NHC ligands will find widespread application in stabilizing reactive metal centers in the fields of organic and inorganic chemistry.







Abstract
The introduction of fluorine atom has attracted considerable interest in molecular design owing to the high electronegativity and the resulting polarization of carbon&#8211;fluorine bonds. Simultaneously, sterically&#8208;hindered N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have received major interest due to high stabilization of the reactive metal centers, which has paved the way for the synthesis of stable and reactive organometallic compounds with broad applications in main group chemistry, inorganic synthesis and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysis. Herein, we report the first class of sterically&#8208;hindered, fluorinated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes. These ligands feature variable fluorine substitution at the N&#8208;aromatic wingtip, permitting to rationally vary steric and electronic characteristics of the carbene center imparted by the fluorine atom. An efficient, one&#8208;pot synthesis of fluorinated IPr*F ligands is presented, enabling broad access of academic and industrial researchers to the fluorinated ligands. The evaluation of steric, electron&#8208;donating and &#960;&#8208;accepting properties as well as coordination chemistry to Au(I), Rh(I) and Se is presented. Considering the unique properties of carbon&#8211;fluorine bonds, we anticipate that this novel class of fluorinated carbene ligands will find widespread application in stabilizing reactive metal centers.

         <title>Selective Synthesis of 3D Aligned VO2 and V2O5 Carbon Nanotube Hybrid Materials by Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gas phase synthesis of vanadium oxides VO2 and V2O5 on vertically aligned 3D arrays of carbon nanotubes (VACNTs) is reported. A systematic investigation of temperature, precursor and reactor constraints towards the controlled synthesis of these composites is presented. Different text spacing!!







Abstract
3D carbon nanotube hybrid materials containing VO2 and V2O5 evenly distributed onto vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (VACNTs) is reported. Adjustable loading of particles in controllable sizes and shapes onto the VACNTs was developed via a stepwise chemical vapour deposition (CVD) approach. Solid VO(acac)2 is chosen as vanadium source. CO2 acts as reactive gas for the pre&#8208;functionalisation of the VACNTs. The process temperature was identified as key parameter to control the deposited vanadium oxide phase. A temperature of 550&#8201;&#176;C results in monoclinic VO2, while 600&#8201;&#176;C results in the deposition of V2O5 onto the VACNT support. The morphology and the amount of deposited material was found to be dependent on the reactor dimensions and the degree of functionalisation of the carbon support. An increase of the D/G ratio of the VACNT from 0.75 to 1.08 caused by a CO2 treatment step within the process led to an increase of the particle coverage from a scarce coverage without prior CO2 treatment to a dense coverage of the VACNT support after 15&#8197;min of CO2 exposure time. Size and crystallinity of the as deposited particles can be further adjusted by a controlled heat treatment after VO(acac)2 precursor deposition.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Mediated Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Difunctionalizations of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light promoted Ni&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric difunctionalizations of alkenes offer an opportunity to build molecular complexity with multiple saturated stereogenic centers in one step from easily&#8208;accessible starting materials. The concept summarizes the progress on this reaction mode and the limitations suffer at this stage. Future efforts are also discussed to evolve this reaction mode into a useful alternative for the construction of diverse chiral architectures.







Abstract
Difunctionalizations of alkenes represent one of the most straightforward protocols to build molecular complexity due to the simultaneous construction of two vicinal bonds cross &#960;&#8208;bond of alkenes. It is extremely attractive yet challenging to control the stereochemistry outcome of this event. Over the past years, visible&#8208;light and Ni&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric difunctionalizations of alkenes provide an environmental benign and promising solution for the construction of saturated carbon centers with the control of regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. In this Concept, the initiative and progress of regio&#8208; and enantioselective difunctionalizations of alkenes enabled by visible&#8208;light and nickel catalysis has been summarized. Moreover, further efforts and directions for the development of visible&#8208;light mediated Ni&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric difunctionalizations of alkenes has been discussed.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Surface&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of sp2 Carbon&#8208;Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework Photocathodes for Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The COFTh&#8208;Cu, synthesized via a simple copper surface&#8208;mediated in&#8208;situ growth method, exhibits remarkable catalytic activity alongside exceptional stability. This distinctive material adeptly bridges the interface between photoactive materials and conductive substrates, fostering a seamless integration that drastically accelerates the migration of charge carriers and consequently boosts the efficiency of photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution.







Abstract
Sp2&#8208;carbon (sp2&#8208;c) covalent organic frameworks (COFs), featuring distinctive &#960;&#8208;conjugated network structures, facilitate the migration of photo&#8208;generated carriers, rendering them exceptionally appealing for applications in photoelectrochemical water splitting. However, owing to the powdery nature of COFs, leaving anchor the sp2&#8208;c COFs powder tightly onto a conductive substrate challenging. Here, we propose a method for preparing photoactive substance&#8208;conductive substrate integrated photocathodes through copper surface&#8208;mediated knoevenagel polycondensation (Cu&#8208;SMKP), this approach results in a uniform and stable sp2&#8208;c COF film, directly grown on commercial copper foam (COFTh&#8208;Cu). The COFTh&#8208;Cu demonstrates a high H2&#8208;evolution photocurrent density of 56&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE, sustaining stability for 12&#8197;h. The as&#8208;prepared COFTh&#8208;Cu represents a 4.5&#8208;fold increase in current density compared to traditional spin&#8208;coating methods and outperforms most COF photocathodes without cocatalysts. This innovative copper surface&#8208;mediated approach for preparing photocathodes opens up a crucial pathway towards the realization of highly active COF photocathodes.

         <title>Skeletal Isomerization of Ergosterol&#8208;5,8&#8208;peroxide Leading to the Discovery of Unprecedented Ergostanes and Collective Syntheses of 5,6&#8208;Epoxysterols and (+)&#8208;Sarocladione</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Skeletal isomerization of ergosterol peroxide, a primary oxidation product of ergosterol, was investigated under thermal and iron(II)&#8208;mediated conditions. Thermal isomerization resulted in not only the isolation of the predicted 7&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;5,6&#8208;epoxides but also the discovery of the unprecedented 7/9/5&#8208;ring&#8208;fused ergostane for the first time. The iron(II)&#8208;mediated isomerization proceeded at ambient temperature, resulting in the formation of the expected 5,6&#8208;epoxysterols and a ring&#8208;opened bicyclic diketone. The diketone was further converted into novel ergostane under thermal conditions and into (+)&#8208;sarocladione under acidic conditions. All transformations from ergosterol to sarocladione, including the isolation of the unstable diketone intermediate, were achieved at ambient temperature, confirming the biosynthetic pathway of sarocladione. Several mushroom ingredients with a 5,6&#8208;epoxy group were synthesized stereoselectively from the isomerization products, leading to the confirmation or revision of the structures of natural products. The &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregation inhibitory activity of synthetic sterols was evaluated for the first time to gain insights into the potential for dementia prevention. This study is valuable both for supplying rare sterols found in mushrooms for biological studies and for shedding light on the oxidative metabolic pathways of ergosterol.</dc:description>

         <title>A Strongly Ambiphilic Ferrocene&#8208;Based Cyclic (Alkyl)(amino)carbene &#8211; Specific Decomposition to an Enamine by a 1,2&#8208;Phenyl Shift</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strongly ambiphilic [3]ferrocenophane&#8208;type CAAC fc(CPh2&#8722;C&#8722;N&#8208;p&#8208;C6H4&#8208;tBu) (1; fc=1,1&#8217;&#8208;ferrocenylene) undergoes a 1,2&#8208;shift of a phenyl group, furnishing the cyclic enamine fc[C(Ph)=C(Ph)&#8722;N&#8208;p&#8208;C6H4&#8208;tBu] (1&#8217;). Efficient trapping of 1 is possible with, inter alia, carbon monoxide and elemental selenium, affording the stable aminoketene 1=C=O and the selenoamide 1=Se, respectively.







Abstract
The recently described crystalline cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene with a 1,1&#8217;&#8208;ferrocenylene (fc) backbone fc(CPh2&#8722;C&#8722;NMes) (A, Mes=mesityl) is highly reactive due to its particularly pronounced ambiphilicity and is thermally not stable in solution due to an intramolecular insertion of the divalent carbon atom into a methyl C&#8722;H bond of the Mes substituent. The closely related congener fc(CPh2&#8722;C&#8722;N&#8208;p&#8208;C6H4&#8208;tBu) (1) cannot undergo such an insertion reaction. Nevertheless, 1 is too short&#8208;lived for isolation due to a rapid 1,2&#8208;shift of a phenyl group, furnishing the isomeric cyclic enamine fc[C(Ph)=C(Ph)&#8722;N&#8208;p&#8208;C6H4&#8208;tBu] (1&#8217;) in a specific decomposition process unprecedented for CAACs. Trapping of 1 was possible with carbon monoxide, elemental selenium and with [CuBr(SMe2)], respectively affording the aminoketene 1=C=O, the selenoamide 1=Se and the homoleptic CuI complex [Cu(1)2][CuBr2]. 1 is an even stronger ambiphile than A according to NMR spectroscopic data. Similar to A, 1 does not react with H2, because the experimentally observed intramolecular process is kinetically more favourable according to DFT results.

         <title>Chirality at Metal in a Linear [Ag(NHC)2]+ Complex: Stereogenic C&#8722;Ag&#8722;C Axis, Atropisomerism and Role of &#960;&#8208;&#960; Interactions</title>

A novel class of linear chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal complexes with atropisomerism by restricted rotation around a stereogenic C&#8722;Ag&#8722;C axis, all thanks to &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions!







Abstract
Chirality at the metal center is a well&#8208;established concept, exemplified by numerous four&#8208; and six&#8208;coordinated complexes. Here, a pioneering example of linear chirality&#8208;at&#8208;metal is described: [Ag(NHC)2]+ (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene). In solution, stabilizing &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions preserve the chiral information of the solid state. Consequently, a novel class of atropisomers is identified, whose stereogenicity arises from hindered rotation around a C&#8722;Ag&#8722;C axis, instead of a typical C&#8722;C bond.

         <title>Computational Screening Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Microporous Polymer Applied in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A 2D conjugated microporous polymer has been synthesized and used to modify the hole transport layer in inverted perovskite solar cells. The aligned Fermi level, enhanced hole mobility and reduced recombination improve the efficiency to 24.64&#8201;%.







Abstract
A two&#8208;dimensional (2D) conjugated microporous polymer with a structure of 2D nanosheets has been synthesized. Theoretical calculations and experimental results reveal that the Fermi level of this 2D polymer aligns well with perovskite absorber, and its conduction band is high enough to block electron transport into the anode. This 2D polymer is used to modify the hole transport layer, significantly improving its photoelectric properties, including enhanced hole mobility, matched energy level, and reduced recombination. Furthermore, the 2D polymer exhibits a mesoporous structure, allowing perovskite to fill into its loose framework, increasing the hole export area and providing a large hole transport flux. As a result, the efficiency of inverted perovskite solar cells enhances to 24.64&#8201;% from 21.17&#8201;% of control device without 2D conjugated microporous polymer. Given that this material can be synthesized on a large scale, this work has significant implications for the future development of 2D polymers in perovskite solar cells, potentially accelerating industrialization.

         <title>Design of an Electrochemical Cell for Continuous Wave EPR Measurements of Radical Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of continuous wave EPR and electrochemistry is powerful for the characterisation of radical ions, which are important intermediates in many processes of biological or technological relevance. Here, we present a simple design for an electrochemical EPR cell that can be replicated easily, at low cost, and is compatible with any standard cwEPR instrumentation including benchtop spectrometers.







Abstract
The combination of continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (cw&#8208;EPR) with electrochemistry is highly attractive as it allows a clean in&#8208;situ generation and the subsequent spectroscopic characterisation of radical ions, which are important intermediates in many photocatalytic cycles as well as light&#8208;induced processes occurring in biological systems or optoelectronic devices. Although commercial setups for spectroelectrochemical EPR are available, they are often expensive and tailored to a particular spectroscopic setup. Here we present a design for a low&#8208;cost electrochemical EPR cell that can be used in combination with any commercial cw&#8208;EPR instrumentation. The cell design is compared to existing setups and the performance of the cell is evaluated by comparison of EPR spectra obtained by chemical and electrochemical oxidation of a graphene fragment.

Photoirradiation of [Rh(N&#8201;N)(C&#8201;N)(H)(CD3OD)]+ (N&#8201;N=6,6&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine, C&#8201;N=[6,6&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine]&#8208;3&#8208;yl&#8208;&#954;C3,&#954;N1&#8217;) provides [Rh(N&#8201;N)2]+, which is a transient species, and immediately regenerates [Rh(N&#8201;N)(C&#8201;N)(H)(CD3OD)]+ by spontaneous cyclometallation. The reversible turnover of the pyridine ring proceeds accompanied by H/D exchange of the H atoms in the Rh&#8722;H bond and at the 3, 3&#8217;&#8208;positions of the N&#8201;N ligand during the photoirradiation.







Abstract
We present the photoreaction of newly prepared bis(6,6&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine)(oxalato)rhodium(III) ([Rh(N&#8201;N)2(ox)]+) in CD3OD. Photoirradiation of this complex causes the dissociation of ox, followed by the formation of the unprecedented Rh(III) complex with Rh&#8722;H and Rh&#8722;C &#963; bonds, [Rh(N&#8201;N)(C&#8201;N)(H)(CD3OD)]+ (C&#8201;N=[6,6&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine]&#8208;3&#8208;yl&#8208;&#954;C3,&#954;N1&#8217;). This hydride formation and cyclometallation spontaneously proceed owing to the conflict between the steric hindrance arising from the methyl groups of N&#8201;N and the driving force for the structural change due to [Rh(N&#8201;N)2]+ formation. Although [Rh(N&#8201;N)(C&#8201;N)(H)(CD3OD)]+ is initially converted to [Rh(N&#8201;N)2]+ by photoirradiation, it is immediately regenerated by the rollover cyclometallation of the [Rh(N&#8201;N)2]+ complex. [Rh(N&#8201;N)(C&#8201;N)(H)(CD3OD)]+ undergoes H/D exchange for the H atoms in the Rh&#8722;H bond and at the 3, 3&#8217;&#8208;positions of the N&#8201;N ligand during the photoirradiation. DFT calculations predict with reasonable certainty the spontaneous structural change of [Rh(N&#8201;N)2]+ to [Rh(N&#8201;N)(C&#8201;N)(H)(CD3OD)]+ and the subsequent photodriven Rh&#8722;C bond rupture leading to the formation of [Rh(N&#8201;N)2]+ accompanied by H/D exchange reactions.

         <title>Photomediated Hexafluoroisopropoxylation of Unactivated Aryl Halides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild photochemical method has been developed for the synthesis of hexafluoroisopropyl aryl ethers, an underexplored functional group in medicinal chemistry. Unactivated aryl chlorides, bromides, and fluorides are efficiently engaged by this methodology, providing the products via a formal nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) process. Application of this reaction in late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactives has also been demonstrated.







Abstract
The use of fluoroalkoxy groups, such as trifluoromethoxy and 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethoxy groups, in pharmaceutical and agrochemical development has increased dramatically in recent years. However, hexafluoroisopropoxy groups have remained significantly under&#8208;represented, presumably due to limited synthetic methods for accessing this substituent in good yields. Herein, we report a mild, photochemical nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) approach for the synthesis of hexafluoroisopropyl aryl ethers from unactivated and abundant aryl halides. Notably, aryl chloride and bromide functionality are efficiently engaged by this methodology in addition to the traditional aryl fluoride nucleofuge. This method provided access to a diverse array of hexafluoroisopropyl aryl ethers, including multiple examples of late&#8208;stage functionalization of active pharmaceutical ingredients. A simple flow system was adapted for 10x scale&#8208;up, maintaining good yield for the reaction. Initial mechanistic studies indicate single electron oxidation of the arene as a key step in product formation.

An adaptable Fe(II) tetrahedral cage, [Fe4L4][BF4]8, based on a tri&#8208;substituted phosphate ligand has been synthesised via self&#8208;assembly. By modulating the orientation of its pendant P=O groups, the cage is capable of encapsulating anionic, neutral, and cationic guests, which was confirmed in the solid state via SCXRD.







Abstract
An adaptable Fe(II) tetrahedral cage, [Fe4L4][BF4]8 (L=tris(4&#8208;(((E)&#8208;pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethylene)amino)phenyl) phosphate), has been synthesised via self&#8208;assembly. By modulating the orientation of its pendant P=O groups, the cage was found to be capable of encapsulating anionic, neutral, and cationic guests, which were confirmed in the solid state via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and in solution by high&#8208;resolution mass spectroscopy (HR&#8208;MS), as well as by NMR (1H, 19F, 31P) studies where possible.

         <title>Investigation of Neighboring Group Participation in 3,4&#8208;Diacetylated Glycosyl Donors in the Gas Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neighboring group participation in 3,4&#8208;diacetylated glycosyl donors can generate two isomeric cations. By integrating infrared ion spectroscopy, isotope labeling and isomer population analysis, we resolved the spectra of isomeric mixtures and quantified the relative contributions of each cationic species.







Abstract
A key challenge in oligosaccharide synthesis is the stereoselective installation of glycosidic bonds. Each glycosidic linkage has one of two possible stereo&#8208;chemical geometries, &#945;/&#946; or 1,2&#8208;cis/trans. An established approach to install 1,2&#8208;trans glycosidic bonds is neighboring group participation (NGP), mediated by a 2&#8208;O&#8208;acyl group. Extension of this intramolecular stabilization to nucleophilic groups located at more remote positions has also been suggested, but remains poorly understood. Previously, we employed infrared ion spectroscopy to characterize the molecular ions of monoacetylated sugar donors and showed how the strength of the stabilizing effect depends on the position of the participating ester group on the glycosyl donor ring as well as on its relative stereochemistry. In this work, we investigated glycosyl donors carrying two acyl groups. Using isotope labelling and isomer population analysis we were able to resolving spectra of isomeric mixtures and establish the relative contribution of individual species. We conclude that 3,4&#8208;diacetyl mannosyl donors exclusively form a dioxanium ion as a result of C&#8208;3 acyl stabilization. In contrast, the glucosyl and galactosyl cations form mixtures of C&#8208;3 and C&#8208;4 acyl participation products. Hence, the combination of isotope labeling and population analysis allows for the study of increasingly complex glycosyl cations.

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;Attached (NHC)Gold(I) and (NHC)Copper(I) Complexes as Photoswitchable Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azobenzene&#8208;functionalized photoswitchable N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes, (IAz&#8208;OMe)AuCl and (IAz&#8208;OMe)CuCl, are synthesized and characterized. The extent of trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis isomerization and concomitant formation of geometrical isomers are investigated. The percentage buried volumes of the cis&#8208;cis catalysts are found to be higher than the trans&#8208;trans isomers. Light&#8208;induced alteration and toggling of reaction rates in oxazoline formation and CuAAC reactions are studied.







Abstract
Photoswitchable (pre)catalysts, N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis&#8208;azobenzene&#8208;based (NHC)gold(I) and N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis&#8208;azobenzene&#8208;derived (NHC)copper(I) complexes are reported. Trans to cis isomerization of the attached photoswitchable moieties in the Au(I) complex enables four&#8208;fold decrement in the rate of oxazoline formation reaction. Whereas the progress of the copper(I) catalyzed, azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition reaction gets reduced by at least threefold. Alternate exposure to UV and blue light could easily toggle the rate of reactions remotely. The catalytic activity of thermodynamically stable trans&#8208;trans isomers is found to be similar to the common N&#8208;aryl substituted NHC&#8722;Au/Cu(I) complexes. NHC&#8722;Au(I) and &#8722;Cu(I) compounds bearing (trans)azobenzene moieties were characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Photoswitching, recyclability studies, and the metastable isomer's thermal half&#8208;life in both complexes were studied via UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy. Whereas the extent of photoswitching and concomitant formation of geometrical isomers were investigated by using 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopic study. Calculated percentage buried volumes of the three geometrical isomers show the trend trans&#8208;trans&lt;trans&#8208;cis&lt;cis&#8208;cis.

         <title>Functionalized &#945;&#8208;Cyanostilbene Derivatives for Detection of Hypoxia or Proteostasis Imbalance in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Cyanostilbene is an easily functionalized aggregation&#8208;induced emission scaffold widely used for constructing fluorescent materials. In this study, we expanded its use to detect hypoxia and proteostasis imbalance in live cells. We introduced four amine&#8208;containing donors to create &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbene derivatives (R&#8208;ASC). The maleimide&#8208;functionalized R&#8208;ASC&#8208;MI detects unfolded proteins under stress, while the nitro&#8208;containing precursors R&#8208;ASC&#8208;NO2 monitor hypoxia. These derivatives show high potential for biosensor applications.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Cyanostilbene represents one of the easily functionalized aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) scaffolds. It has been widely adopted for the construction of fluorescent materials for broad applications. Here, we further expanded the utilization of &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbene derivatives for the detection of hypoxia or proteostasis imbalance in live cells. Four different amine containing donors were introduced to construct &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbene derivatives (R&#8208;ASC) with donor&#8208;acceptor scaffolds. Equipped with the cysteine (Cys) reactive group, maleimide (MI), R&#8208;ASC&#8208;MI shows fluorescence turn&#8208;on property upon binding with unfolded proteins in&#8197;vitro and in live cells under proteostatic stress. By virtue of R&#8208;ASC&#8208;MI, the level of unfolded protein loads in cells can be quantified by flow cytometry, or visualized under microscope. Furthermore, we also characterized the performance of R&#8208;ASC&#8208;NO2, synthetic precursors of R&#8208;ASC&#8208;MI, in cellular hypoxia. R&#8208;ASC&#8208;NO2 revealed upregulated activities of nitroreductase, as well as increased hydrophobicity in live cells, under either chemical (NaN3) induced or atmospheric (1&#8201;% O2) hypoxia. Together, the advantages of easy modification and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of new &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbene derivatives reported in this work highlight the great potential of &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbene in constructing functional biosensors and many other domains.

         <title>The Key to MOF Membrane Fabrication and Application: the Trade&#8208;off between Crystallization and Film Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), owing the merits of ordered and tailored channel structures in the burgeoning crystalline porous materials, have demonstrated significant promise in construction of high&#8208;performance separation membranes. In this review, influencing factors of polycrystalline MOF membrane formation are summarized, the trade&#8208;off relationship between crystallization and membrane formation is discussed.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), owing the merits of ordered and tailored channel structures in the burgeoning crystalline porous materials, have demonstrated significant promise in construction of high&#8208;performance separation membranes. However, precisely because this crystal structure with strong molecular interaction in their lattice provides robust structural integrity and resistance to chemical and thermal degradation, crystalline MOFs typically exhibit insolubility, infusibility, stiffness and brittleness, and therefore their membrane&#8208;processing properties are far inferior to the flexible amorphous polymers and hinder their subsequent storage, transportation, and utilization. Hence, focusing on film&#8208;formation and crystallization is the foundation for exploring the fabrication and application of MOF membranes. In this review, the film&#8208;forming properties of crystalline MOFs are fundamentally analyzed from their inherent characteristics and compared with those of amorphous polymers, influencing factors of polycrystalline MOF membrane formation are summarized, the trade&#8208;off relationship between crystallization and membrane formation is discussed, and the strategy solving the film formation of crystalline MOFs in recent years are systematically reviewed, in anticipation of realizing the goal of preparing crystalline membranes with optimized processability and excellent performance.

         <title>Organic Two&#8208;Photon&#8208;Absorbing Photosensitizers Can Overcome Competing Light Absorption in Organic Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To avoid the competing light absorption in organic photocatalysis, which typically occurs in the UV/vis region, herein we report a novel two&#8208;photon&#8208;absorbing photocatalyst dBAP&#8208;OMe that shows excellent photocatalytic performance under deep red light irradiation.







Abstract
Conventional organic photocatalysis typically relies on ultraviolet and short&#8208;wavelength visible photons as the energy source. However, this approach often suffers from competing light absorption by reactants, products, intermediates, and co&#8208;catalysts, leading to reduced quantum efficiency and side reactions. To address this issue, we developed novel organic two&#8208;photon&#8208;absorbing (TPA) photosensitizers capable of functioning under deep red and near&#8208;infrared light irradiation. Three model reactions including cyclization, Sonogashira Csp2&#8722;Csp cross&#8208;coupling, and Csp2&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling reactions were selected to compare the performance of the new photosensitizers under both blue (427&#8197;nm) and deep red (660&#8197;nm) light irradiation. The obtained results unambiguously prove that for reactions involving blue light&#8208;absorbing reactants, products, and/or co&#8208;catalysts, deep red light source resulted in better performance than blue light when utilizing our TPA photosensitizers. This work highlights the potential of our metal&#8208;free TPA photosensitizers as a sustainable and effective solution to mitigate the competing light absorption issue in photocatalysis, not only expanding the scope of organic photocatalysts but also reducing reliance on expensive Ru/Ir/Os&#8208;based photosensitizers.

Three model reactions including cyclization, Sonogashira C&lt;sub&gt;sp2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; cross-coupling, and C&lt;sub&gt;sp2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;N cross-coupling reactions were selected to compare the performance of the new photosensitizers under both blue (427&#8197;nm) and deep red (660&#8197;nm) light irradiation. The obtained results unambiguously prove that for reactions involving blue light-absorbing reactants, products, and/or co-catalysts, deep red light source resulted in better performance than blue light when utilizing our TPA photosensitizers. This work highlights the potential of our metal-free TPA photosensitizers as a sustainable and effective solution to mitigate the competing light absorption issue in photocatalysis, not only expanding the scope of organic photocatalysts but also reducing reliance on expensive Ru/Ir/Os-based photosensitizers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interface Engineering of Flower&#8208;like Co 2 P/WO 3&#8208;x /Carbon Cloth Catalysts with Oxygen Vacancies for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Constructing an efficient and low&#8208;cost oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst is critical for improving the performance of electrolysis in alkaline water. In this study, a self&#8208;supported electrocatalyst of flower&#8208;like cobalt phosphide and tungsten oxide (Co2P/WO3&#8208;x/CC) was prepared on carbon cloth (CC)&#160;surface by hydrothermal reaction with solution immersion etching and phosphorization annealing under H2/Ar atmosphere. This strategy can generate oxygen vacancies (OV), improving the speed of charge transfer between cobalt phosphide (Co2P) and tungsten oxide (WO3&#8208;x) components. The catalyst greatly increases the electrochemical active surface area, which is beneficial for efficient oxygen evolution. Electrochemical testing studies show that in 1.0 M KOH solution, Co2P&#8208;WO3&#8208;x/CC catalyst exhibits good OER activity, with a low overpotential of 254 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2, a small Tafel slope of 58.32 mV dec&#8208;1. The synergistic effect of oxygen vacancies and Co2P with WO3&#8208;x&#160;can regulate electronic structures, expose more active sites, and cooperatively enhancing the OER activity. This study provides a workable strategy for preparing efficient non&#8208;noble metal OER electrocatalysts on engineered interfaces and OV.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Cascade Reactions of Aminocatalytic Dienamines and Trienamines Initiated by a Cycloaddition Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cycloadditions are widely accepted as a group of reactions that rapidly generate molecular complexity. Being highly atom economic and often predictable, these reactions can generate up to four stereogenic centers and two C&#8208;C (or C&#8208;X) bonds in one reaction step. During the last two decades, asymmetric aminocatalysis has shown to be a successful strategy for controlling stereoselectivity and enabling reactivity of cycloaddition reactions. By increasing the conjugation of the carbonyl species employed, dienamines and trienamines can be catalytically formed. Not only can these facilitate the cycloaddition, often accompanied by high levels of stereocontrol, but they also leave a residual enamine or carbonyl (by hydrolysis) in the cycloadduct. This residual functionality can engage in further intramolecular reactions generating complex cyclic systems in a one&#8208;pot cascade manner. In this regard, asymmetric aminocatalysis can add another layer of complexity to the already complex nature of cycloadditions. In this review, we will present the general concept of such reactivity patterns of dienamines and trienamines, and hereafter showcase examples in the literature. We aspire that the chemical community can use these concepts to design new enantioselective aminocatalytic cascade reactions to access enantioenriched, complex compounds, and perhaps use these in complex molecule synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenazinium&#8208; and Malachite Green&#8208;Based Pd(II) Cages: Chiroptical Discrimination of Nucleoside Triphosphates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic chromophores have been successfully implemented into supramolecular systems to bestow them with distinct photophysical properties for various applications, ranging from solar energy conversion, photochemical reactions or as receptors for guest molecules with optical readout. We had previously introduced first members of the large family of coal&#8208;tar dyes (methylene blue, crystal violet and rhodamine) as integral components of coordination cages. Here, we add two new chromophores, malachite green (MGP) and a purple phenazinium dye (PHP), serving as backbones of bis&#8208;monodentate banana&#8208;shaped ligands with pyridine donors. We show the formation of corresponding green and purple coloured Pd2L4 coordination cages and investigate their interaction with chiral guest molecules via UV&#8208;Vis and CD spectroscopy. The PHP cage can be used to recognize nucleoside triphosphates, based on chirality transfer from the guests to the structurally flexible helicate. In combination with the already known methylene blue cage MBP we could further differentiate between all four canonical NTPs through characteristic changes in the observed CD signatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Overcoming the Challenges of Hyperpolarizing Substrates with Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Polarization in an MRI System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hyperpolarization of 13C nuclei in biomolecules and their administration as imaging agents enables in&#8208;vivo monitoring of metabolism. This approach has demonstrated potential for deriving imaging biomarkers for cancer detection, differentiation, and therapy efficacy assessment. The in situ generation of polarized substrates using a permanent addition of parahydrogen to an unsaturated precursor inside the bore of an MRI system used for subsequent imaging circumvents the need for a dedicated external polarizer. This approach reduces polarization loss associated with sample transfer, minimizes hardware requirements and cost, and results in reduced spatial requirements. However, performing INEPT&#8208;like pulsed sequences for heteronuclear spin&#8208;order transfer in the bore of an MRI system is challenged by poor uniformity of static and excitation magnetic field and molecular convection during the polarization transfer. Therefore, here we characterize these effects, implement a robust modification to the pulse sequence, and measure experimentally the polarization improvement upon modification of the sequence. After rigorous optimization of the parameters, we obtained a 13C polarization of 44.5% for 50 mM of the 1&#8208;13C site of ethyl acetate&#8208;d6. Our parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization approach enhances the accessibility to hyperpolarized MRI, circumventing the need for an external polarizer.</dc:description>

         <title>When the Study of the Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification Method on a 1D Spin Crossover Coordination Polymer Highlights its Catalytic Activity.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We are interested in studying the catalytic activity of the spin crossover (SCO) complex ([Fe(NH2trz)3](NO3)2). In this work, we demonstrate that, by adapting the experimental conditions, we can switch from a quantitative post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) reaction to the use of this complex as a catalyst for the formation of imine from 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole. During the catalytic reaction, the iron complex undergoes two different PSM reactions: the first is the action of the aldehyde on the NH2 groups present on the complex, whereas the second PSM reaction occurs between the imine complex and aminotriazole, leading back to the starting complex. These two PSM reactions are at least partially involved in the catalytic mechanism. Furthermore, the combination of these two PSM reactions enables us to modulate the particle size and shape of the final amine complex without altering its excellent SCO properties. This result is of interest in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, where particle size has a strong influence on the catalytic activity, and for the proper integration in devices for different applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Substituted Hybrid Zinc Halides with Remarkable Dielectric Switches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermo&#8208;responsive dielectric switching hybrid halides, displaying reversible dielectric bistability, have recently made them highly versatile and attractive for their structural tunability and rich functional properties. However, the substantial improvement of the dielectric switching operating range is limited near room temperature, and obtaining ultra&#8208;wide dielectric switching temperature region is a major challenge. Herein, a remarkable dielectric switching effect is reported with ultra&#8208;wide dielectric switching temperature region in a hybrid halide system, caused by dipolar orientational polarization ascribing order&#8208;disorder phase transitions. The new A2BX4 hybrid halide [C6H5(CH2)4NH3]2ZnBr4 (4PBA&#8208;ZnBr4) with an ultra&#8208;wide dielectric hysteresis loop of about 55&#160;K near room temperature is designed successfully through halogen substitution. Meanwhile, structurally similar hybrid materials 4PBA&#8208;ZnI4 were designed as controls. More interestingly, the crystal structure, phase transition temperature (Tc), dielectric and semiconductor properties exhibit significant discrepancies as the halogen atoms vary from Br to I. This discovery provides an efficiently regulated anionic framework to construct hybrid halides with ultra&#8208;wide high dielectric switching and reliable cycling stability by assembling with various cations, making them potentially excellent candidates for highly responsive room temperature smart switches or transducer devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Triarylmethanol Derivatives with Ultralong Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triphenylmethyl&#8208;based compounds such as rhodamines and fluoresceine representing an old and well&#8208;known class of triphenylmethane dyes, are widely used in fluorescent labeling of bioimaging. Inspired by ultralong room temperature phosphorescence of triphenylphosphine derivatives, herein we report a methoxy substituted triarylmethanol ((4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)diphenylmethanol, LJW&#8208;1) exhibits ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) under ambient condition with afterglows of about 7 seconds. Its multiple C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; intermolecular interactions, C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O intermolecular interactions, hydrogen bond and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions are beneficial for forming rigid environment in the aggregated state which is evidently an important factor in the appearance of excellent RTP. Different substituents on triarylmethanol result in compounds with different lifetimes varying from 7 &#181;s to 818 ms. The substituent effects on the phosphorescence of triarylmethanol derivatives provide an efficient method for the design of organic RTP materials and may be enlightening the phosphorescence research of triarylmethanol derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Dots Enabling High&#8208;Performances Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dots (CDs), known for their quantum size, abundant surface functional groups, excellent biocompatibility, and non&#8208;toxicity, have emerged as promising candidates for enhancing various advanced rechargeable batteries. Recent research indicates that electrodes based on or modified with CDs in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have shown significant improvements in key performance metrics such as Coulombic efficiency, cycle life, and capacity compared to traditional electrodes. Several key impacts of CDs contribute to these enhancements, including increased conductivity due to their conductive graphitized core, rich absorption sites, and excellent dispersity facilitated by abundant surface functional groups. These features accelerate ion transport through interface edges and ion diffusion paths, inhibit electrode material dissolution, buffer electrode material volume expansion, ensure electrode uniformity and stability, and promote the electrochemical reaction process between the electrode and electrolyte. This review summarizes recent developments, challenges, and opportunities in leveraging CDs as additives in SIBs, focusing on their impact on electrolyte properties, electrode materials, and overall battery performance. It provides a comprehensive understanding of the potential of CDs to significantly advance SIB technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Na ions doped Fe2VO4 cathode for high performance aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc ion batteries are thought to be a new generation of secondary batteries that will replace lithium ion batteries due to their great safety and inexpensive cost. In the cathode materials of aqueous zinc ion batteries with long life and high capacity, abundant active sites and crystal structure stability play an important role. In the present work, the strategy of Na+ intercalation of Fe2VO4 (FVO) is proposed, aiming at the insertion of Na+, which not only enriches the active sites, but also sodium and iron ions act as guest species with the negatively charged VOx lattice to provide strong electrostatic attraction to stabilize the lamellar structure. In terms of electrochemical performance, the discharge specific capacity is 370 mAh g&#8208;1 at a current density of 0.1 A g&#8208;1, and when the current density is arising 5 A g&#8208;1, the specific capacity also reaches 200 mAh g&#8208;1 after cycling 2000 with a capacity retention of 99%, which is better than the electrochemical performance of Fe2VO4 (FVO) alone at 50 mAh g&#8208;1. The superior electrochemical performance proves that FVO&#8208;Na is an ideal cathode material for zinc ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gluconolactone serves as a readily available and inexpensive starting material for synthesizing the potential platform chemical (Z)&#8208;3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;1,2:5,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;isopropylidene&#8208;D&#8208;erythro&#8208;hex&#8208;3&#8208;enolactone in two steps. In this work, the selective elimination of triacetone gluconolactone was optimized. The resulting product is a versatile molecule, capable of being transformed into various compound classes in one or a few steps, i.e. potentially a new biomass&#8208;based platform chemical. This study demonstrates how it can be transformed into furanics, rare sugars, &#946;&#8208;ketoamides, and amino furanones.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantum Information Patterns Between Atoms in a Molecule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 60, October 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atoms in a molecule are conceptual open quantum systems that exchange information. Quantifying that information allows for the characterization of such quantum atoms and how they interact with their molecular environment.







Abstract
Quantum information theory provides a powerful toolbox of descriptors that characterize many&#8208;electron systems based on quantum information patterns between open quantum systems. Despite the wealth of insights gained in the condensed matter community, the use of these descriptors to study interactions between atoms in a molecule remains limited. In this study, we develop a quantum information framework for molecules that characterizes the quantum information patterns between quantum atoms as defined in the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules. We show that quantum information analyses capture key properties of quantum atoms and how they interact with their molecular environment. Additionally, we show that the presence of bond critical points can remain invariant despite large changes in the quantum information patterns between the quantum atoms. Our findings indicate that quantum information theory can shed a new light on molecular electronic structure.

         <title>Non&#8208;Medical Applications of Inorganic Medicines. A Switch Based on Mechanistic Knowledge</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 60, October 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from the description of integrated approaches for unveiling the molecular interactions underlying the biological effects of metallodrugs, through selected examples, it is highlighted how the obtained mechanistic information may turn relevant for the application of inorganic drugs in fields different from medicine.







Abstract
Metals have been used in medicine for centuries. However, it was not until much later that the effects of inorganic drugs could be rationalized from a mechanistic point of view. Today, thanks to the technologies available, this approach has been functionally developed and implemented. It has been found that there is probably no single biological target for the pharmacological effects of most inorganic drugs. Herein, we present an overview of some integrated and multi&#8208;technique approaches to elucidate the molecular interactions underlying the biological effects of metallodrugs. On this premise, selected examples are used to illustrate how the information obtained on metal&#8208;based drugs and their respective mechanisms can become relevant for applications in fields other than medicine. For example, some well&#8208;known metallodrugs, which have been shown to bind specific amino acid residues of proteins, can be used to solve problems related to protein structure elucidation in crystallographic studies. Diruthenium tetraacetate can be used to catalyze the conversion of hydroxylamines to nitrones with a high selectivity when bound to lysozyme. Finally, a case study is presented in which an unprecedented palladium/arsenic&#8208;mediated catalytic cycle for nitrile hydration was discovered thanks to previous studies on the solution chemistry of the anticancer compound arsenoplatin&#8208;1 (AP&#8208;1).

         <title>Differential Sensing Approach as a Pattern&#8208;based Discrimination for Biological Samples</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 60, October 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A differential sensing strategy offers great potential for biological sample discrimination and diagnostics. Distinctive response patterns were generated for various bacteria, viruses, and biofluids with different disease states using a series of sensor arrays, including colorimetric off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf dyes, surface&#8208;functionalized nanoparticles and fluorophores, graphene oxide, fluorescent reporters, and chemosensors.







Abstract
The differential sensing approach uses fingerprint patterning to distinguish uncharacterized biological samples. Inspired by natural sensory systems, an array of cross&#8208;reactive sensors generates unique response fingerprint depending on the samples. Until today, this array system has been developed using various materials, including the library of surface&#8208;charged nanoparticles and chemosensors. Many differential array systems have demonstrated accurate identification of bacterial species, viral subtypes, and cancer cells, as well as distinguishing disease states in blood or urine. This capability is particularly important for distinguishing between normal and abnormal states when specific marker molecules have not yet been identified, providing a powerful diagnostic tool. In this concept, we summarized representative outcomes of differential sensing applications for biological sample discrimination.

         <title>Controlling (E/Z)&#8208;Stereoselectivity of &#8722;NHC=O Chlorination: Mechanism Principles for Wide Scope Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 60, October 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the increasing interest in halo compounds in chemotherapy and protein modification/targeting in chiral bioenvironments, controlling the halogenation stereoselectivity is state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art science. Halogenation of carbamoyl group (&#8722;NHC=O) has never been mechanistically studied. Herein, we dive into depths of regioselectivity and stereoselectivity, provide the first comprehensive mechanism highlighting the selectivity&#8208;limiting factors and provide subsequent inspirations to control the (E/Z)&#8208;stereochemical output and insights into multidisciplinary applications.







Abstract
Organic halogen compounds are cornerstones of applied chemical sciences. Halogen substitution is a smart molecular design strategy adopted to influence reactivity, membrane permeability and receptor interaction. Chiral bioreceptors may restrict the stereochemical requirements in the halo&#8208;ligand design. Straightforward (but expensive) catalyzed stereospecific halogenation has been reported. Historically, PCl5 served access to uncatalyzed stereoselective chlorination although the stereochemical outcomes were influenced by steric parameters. Nonetheless, stereochemical investigation of PCl5 reaction mechanism with carbamoyl (RCONHX) compounds has never been addressed. Herein, we provide the first comprehensive stereochemical mechanistic explanation outlining halogenation of carbamoyl compounds with PCl5; the key regioselectivity&#8208;limiting nitrilimine intermediate (8&#8208;Z.HCl); how substitution pattern influences regioselectivity; why oxadiazole byproduct (P1) is encountered; stereo&#8208;electronic factors influencing the hydrazonoyl chloride (P2) production; and discovery of two stereoselectivity&#8208;limiting parallel mechanisms (stepwise and concerted) of elimination of HCl and POCl3. DFT calculations, synthetic methodology optimization, X&#8208;ray evidence and experimental reaction kinetics study evidence all supported the suggested mechanism proposal (Scheme&#8197;2). Finally, we provide mechanism&#8208;inspired future recommendations for directing the reaction stereoselectivity toward elusive and stereochemically inaccessible (E)&#8208;bis&#8208;hydrazonoyl chlorides along with potentially pivotal applications of both (E/Z)&#8208;stereoisomers especially in medicinal chemistry and protein modification.

         <title>Elucidating Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Tunneling Kinetics in the Cope Rearrangement of Semibullvalene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 60, October 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
When heavy atom tunneling regime is attained, the free energy reaction profile tunnels below the potential energy profile due to the inclusion of nuclear quantum effects. Ring Polymer Molecular Dynamics simulations are able to provide free energy and rate constants describing this phenomenon. Here we use the Cope's rearrangement of semibullvalene as prototypical reaction.







Abstract
In this work, we characterize the temperature dependence of kinetic properties in heavy atom tunneling reactions by means of molecular dynamics simulations, including nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) via Path Integral theory. To this end, we consider the prototypical Cope rearrangement of semibullvalene. The reaction was studied in the 25&#8211;300&#8197;K temperature range observing that the inclusion of NQEs modifies the temperature behavior of both free energy barriers and dynamical recrossing factors with respect to classical dynamics. Notably, while in classical simulations the activation free energy shows a very weak temperature dependence, it becomes strongly dependent on temperature when NQEs are included. This temperature behavior shows a transition from a regime where the quantum effects are limited and can mainly be traced back to zero point energy, to a low temperature regime where tunneling plays a dominant role. In this regime, the free energy curve tunnels below the potential energy barrier along the reaction coordinate, allowing much faster reaction rates. Finally, the temperature dependence of the rate constants obtained from molecular dynamics simulations was compared with available experimental data and with semi&#8208;classical transition state theory calculations, showing comparable behaviors and similar transition temperatures from thermal to (deep) tunneling regime.

         <title>Two&#8208;Coordinate Dinuclear Donor&#8208;Gold(I)&#8208;Acceptor Complexes Exhibiting Multiple Excitation Wavelength Dependent Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 60, October 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dinuclear donor&#8208;Au&#8208;acceptor complexes with intramolecular aurophilic interactions were synthesized. The increased metal contribution to the highest occupied molecular orbital enlarges S1&#8208;T1 energy gap, which disables the thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Moreover, unexpected excitation wavelength dependent multiple phosphorescence was observed, attributed to the poor internal conversion originating from the large energy separation and spatially isolated orbital between various excited states.







Abstract
Two&#8208;coordinate Au(I) complexes with a donor&#8208;metal&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;M&#8208;A) structure have shown rich luminescent properties. However, charge&#8208;neutral dinuclear donor&#8208;metal&#8208;acceptor type Au(I) complexes featuring aurophilic interactions have been seldom explored. Herein, we describe the structures and photoluminescence properties of two dinuclear Au(I) complexes, namely DiAu&#8208;Ph and DiAu&#8208;Me. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis of DiAu&#8208;Ph reveals a short intramolecular Au&#8208;Au distance of 3.224&#8197;&#197;. In dilute solution and doped films, excitation wavelength dependent multiple phosphorescence phenomena were observed for these dinuclear complexes. Theoretical calculations reveal that the aurophilic interaction causes increased contribution of the Au d orbital to the highest occupied molecular orbitals. Thus, the gap between singlet and triplet excited states (&#916;EST) is enlarged, which disables the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Moreover, the large energy separation (0.45&#8211;0.52&#8197;eV) and the different orbital configurations between the various excited states result in an inefficient internal conversion, accounting for their multiple phosphorescence properties.

         <title>Double Chalcogen Bonding Recognition Arrays in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 60, October 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work focused on the dimerization of newly synthetized Pyrselen derivatives, being evaluated both at the solid state (by XRD analysis) and in solution, by 77Se NMR dilution experiments carried out in CDCl3 at 298&#8197;K. Notably, the self&#8208;assembly at the liquid state is persistently observed in different solvents, highlighting the charge&#8208;transfer contribution of this interaction.







Abstract
N&#8208;substituted pyridino&#8208;based congeners of Ebselen, named here as Pyrselen, incorporating proximal Se and N atoms, undergo dimerization in solution and the solid state through a dual donor&#8208;acceptor arrangement of chalcogen bonding sites. Dimerization constants were measured within the 5&#8211;50&#8197;M&#8722;1 range. Computational studies on the dimers depict a notable charge&#8208;transfer contribution to the association, validating Pyrselen as an effective scaffold for designing chalcogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;based recognition motifs.

         <title>THz&#8208;EPR&#8208;based Magneto&#8208;Structural Correlations for Cobalt(II) Single&#8208;Ion Magnets With Bis&#8208;Chelate Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 60, October 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An experimental basis for understanding the structure&#8208;property relationships for tetrahedrally coordinated cobalt&#8208;based single&#8208;ion magnets is derived from precise zero&#8208;field splitting energies directly obtained by THz&#8208;EPR spectroscopy. A large elongation increases the magnetization barrier, while twisting of the chelate planes increases rhombicity and thus promotes relaxation by undesired quantum tunneling processes.







Abstract
New cobalt(II)&#8208;based complexes with [N2O2] coordination formed by two bis&#8208;chelate ligands were synthesized and characterized by a multi&#8208;technique approach. The complexes possess an easy&#8208;axis anisotropy (D&lt;0) and magnetic measurements show a field&#8208;induced slow relaxation of magnetization. The spin&#8208;reversal barriers, i.&#8201;e., the splitting of the two lowest Kramers doublets (UZFS), have been measured by THz&#8208;EPR spectroscopy, which allows to distinguish the two crystallographically independent species present in one of the complexes. Based on these experimental UZFS energies together with those for related complexes reported in literature, it was possible to establish magneto&#8208;structural correlations. UZFS linearly depends on the elongation parameter &#1013;T of the (pseudo&#8208;)tetrahedral coordination, which is given by the ratio between the average obtuse and acute angles at the cobalt(II) ion, while UZFS was found to be virtually independent of the twist angle of the chelate planes. With increasing deviation from the orthogonality of the latter, the rhombicity (|E/D|) increases.

         <title>Cyanide Linkage Isomerization Induced by Cobalt Oxidation&#8208;State Changes at a Co&#8722;Fe Prussian&#8208;Blue Analogue/ZnO Interface</title>

         <dc:description>
VSFG spectroscopy in combination with electrochemistry reveals critical interplay between interfacial oxidation and cyanide flip in Co&#8722;Fe Prussian Blue/ZnO heterostructure. Tuning the fabrication temperature for such heterostructure gives access to an easily accessible approach for controlling interfacial composition. This work shows that co&#8208;operativity at the molecular level facilitate kinetically demanding chemical processes at such interfaces.







Abstract
Understanding the interfacial composition in heterostructures is crucial for tailoring heterogenous electrochemical and photoelectrochemical processes. This work aims to elucidate the structure of a series of Co&#8722;Fe Prussian blue analogue modified ZnO (PBA/ZnO) electrodes with interface&#8208;sensitive vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy. Our measurements revealed, for the first time, a cyanide linkage isomerism at the PBA/ZnO interface, when the composite is fabricated at elevated temperatures. In situ VSFG spectro&#8208;electrochemistry measurements correlate the CoII&#8594;CoIII oxidation with the flip of the bridging CN ligand from Co&#8722;NC&#8722;Fe coordination mode to a Co&#8722;CN&#8722;Fe one. Photoluminescence measurements and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that this unprecedented linkage isomerism originates from surface defects, which act as oxidation sites for the PBA. The presence of such surface defects is correlated with the fabrication temperature for PBA/ZnO. Thus, this contribution identifies the interplay between the surface states of the ZnO substrates and the chemical composition of PBA at the ZnO surface, suggesting an easily accessible approach to control the chemical composition of the interface.

         <title>Covalent Lysozyme Immobilization on Enzymatic Cellulose Nanocrystals</title>

TEMPO&#8208;oxidized cellulose nanocrystals (TO&#8208;CNCs) are an excellent substrate for the covalent immobilization of lysozyme from chicken egg white. The bioconjugates are synthesized, isolated and characterized and are potential candidates as antibacterial materials.







Abstract
Nanostructured materials represent promising substrates for biocatalyst immobilization and activation. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), accessible from waste and/or renewable sources, are sustainable and biodegradable, show high specific surface area for anchoring a high number of enzymatic units, and high thermal and mechanical stability. In this work, we present a holistic enzyme&#8208;based approach to functional antibacterial materials by bioconjugation between the lysozyme from chicken egg white and enzymatic cellulose nanocrystals. The neutral CNCs were prepared by endoglucanase hydrolysis from Avicel. We explore the covalent immobilization of lysozyme on enzymatic CNCs and on their TEMPO oxidized derivatives (TO&#8208;CNCs), comparing immobilization yields, material properties, and enzymatic activities. The materials were characterized by X&#8208;ray diffractometry (XRD), attenuated total reflectance Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;FTIR), bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay, field&#8208;emission scanning electron microscopy (FE&#8208;SEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). We demonstrate the higher overall efficiency of the immobilization process carried out on TO&#8208;CNCs, based on the success of covalent bonding and on the stability of the isolated bioconjugates.

         <title>A Two&#8208;Step Intermolecular Interaction Of Molecular Macroions With Multivalent Counterions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 60, October 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular cluster U60 macroion exhibits a very different solution behavior depending on the valences of added counterions. When multivalent counterions are introduced, unlike monovalent counterions, there is an additional step for the macroion&#8208;counterion interaction. The two&#8208;step mechanism can be nicely correlated to the microscopic (self&#8208;assembly) and macroscopic (gelation) phase transitions observed in the macroionic aqueous systems.







Abstract
Macroion&#8208;counterion interaction is essential for regulating the solution behaviors of hydrophilic macroions, as simple models for polyelectrolytes. Here, we explore the interaction between uranyl peroxide molecular cluster Li68K12(OH)20[UO2(O2)OH]60 (U60) and multivalent counterions. Different from interaction with monovalent counterions that shows a simple one&#8208;step process, isothermal titration calorimetry, combined with light/X&#8208;ray scattering measurements and electron microscopy, confirm a two&#8208;step process for their interaction with multivalent counterions: an ion&#8208;pairing between U60 and the counterion with partial breakage of hydration shells followed by strong U60&#8208;U60 attraction, leading to the formation of large nanosheets with severe breakage and reconstruction of hydration shells. The detailed studies on macroion&#8208;counterion interaction can be nicely correlated to the microscopic (self&#8208;assembly) and macroscopic (gelation or phase separation) phase transitions in the dilute U60 aqueous solutions induced by multivalent counterions.

     alt="A Two-Step Intermolecular Interaction Of Molecular Macroions With Multivalent Counterions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The molecular cluster &lt;b&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; macroion exhibits a very different solution behavior depending on the valences of added counterions. When multivalent counterions are introduced, unlike monovalent counterions, there is an additional step for the macroion-counterion interaction. The two-step mechanism can be nicely correlated to the microscopic (self-assembly) and macroscopic (gelation) phase transitions observed in the macroionic aqueous systems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macroion-counterion interaction is essential for regulating the solution behaviors of hydrophilic macroions, as simple models for polyelectrolytes. Here, we explore the interaction between uranyl peroxide molecular cluster Li&lt;sub&gt;68&lt;/sub&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;[UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)OH]&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) and multivalent counterions. Different from interaction with monovalent counterions that shows a simple one-step process, isothermal titration calorimetry, combined with light/X-ray scattering measurements and electron microscopy, confirm a two-step process for their interaction with multivalent counterions: an ion-pairing between &lt;b&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and the counterion with partial breakage of hydration shells followed by strong &lt;b&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; attraction, leading to the formation of large nanosheets with severe breakage and reconstruction of hydration shells. The detailed studies on macroion-counterion interaction can be nicely correlated to the microscopic (self-assembly) and macroscopic (gelation or phase separation) phase transitions in the dilute &lt;b&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization and Photophysical Properties of a New Family of Rare&#8208;Earth Cluster&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>

The graphic depicts RE&#8208;CU&#8208;45, a rare&#8208;earth metal&#8208;organic framework, which features 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylic acid linkers and hexanuclear RE(III) clusters (RE(III)=Eu(III), Gd(III), Tb(III), Dy(III), Ho(III), Er(III), Tm(III), Yb(III), Lu(III), and Y(III)). The MOF linker can be excited at 290&#8197;nm and, through the antenna effect, promote energy transfer to the RE(III) ions, leading to emission in the visible and/or near&#8208;infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum.







Abstract
In this work, nine new rare&#8208;earth metal&#8211;organic frameworks (RE&#8208;MOFs, where RE=Lu(III), Yb(III), Tm(III), Er(III), Ho(III), Dy(III), Tb(III), Gd(III), and Eu(III)) isostructural to Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;808 are synthesized, characterized, and studied regarding their photophysical properties. Materials with high crystallinity and surface area are obtained from a reproducible synthetic procedure that involves the use of two fluorinated modulators. At the same time, these new RE&#8208;MOFs display tunable photoluminescent properties due to efficient linker&#8208;to&#8208;metal energy transfer promoted by the antenna effect, resulting in a series of RE&#8208;MOFs displaying lanthanoid&#8208;based emissions spanning the visible and near&#8208;infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.

         <title>Facile Method to Obtain Functionalised &#951;6&#8208;Bound Arenes in Ru(II) and Os(II) Half&#8208;Sandwich Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 60, October 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We pioneer the use of a practical C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp2) coupling method to obtain Ru(II)&#8208; and Os(II)&#8208;&#951;6&#8208;arene half&#8208;sandwich complexes with a wide variety of arene functionalities, including those that enable the formation of tether rings. We synthesise 28 new complexes bearing eight different substituents, mostly unreported for Ru(II) or Os(II) half&#8208;sandwich complexes, such as quinoline (tethered and non&#8208;tethered) and coumarin.







Abstract
Half&#8208;sandwich Ru(II)&#8208; and Os(II)&#8208;arene complexes have great potential for catalytic and biological applications. The possibility of fine&#8208;tuning their chemical reactivity by including modifications in the ligands around the metal adds to their many advantages. However, structural modifications at the &#951;6&#8208;bound arene have had significant synthetic limitations, particularly in the design of Os(II)&#8208;tethered complexes. For the first time, we have employed a practical C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp2) coupling to obtain 28 new Ru(II) and Os(II) &#951;6&#8208;arene half&#8208;sandwich complexes with a wide variety of arene functionalities, including those that enable the formation of tether rings, such as quinoline, and coumarin. The introduction of novel functional groups at the arene in Ru(II)&#8208; and Os(II) half&#8208;sandwich complexes can broaden the synthetic scope of this type of organometallic complexes, and help to take full advantage of their structural diversity, for example, in intracellular catalysis.

In the QM cluster approach an extract from the active site of an enzyme is used to calculate the fast reaction processes and spectroscopic features of short&#8208;lived intermediates. In their Review (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202402468), S.&#8197;P. de Visser, Chivukula&#8197;V. Sastri and co&#8208;workers describe the recommended approaches to set up and select QM cluster models. Furthermore, a range of examples are given that have validated QM cluster models against experiment and highlight that the calculations can predict the correct selectivity and find a free energy of activation close to experiment.

         <title>Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials for Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 60, October 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the recent application of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) techniques in the atomistic modeling of heterogeneous catalytic systems. A summary and best practices for utilizing MLIPs are provided, aiming to facilitate the application of MLIPs in the catalysis community.







Abstract
Atomistic modeling can provide valuable insights into the design of novel heterogeneous catalysts as needed nowadays in the areas of, e.&#8201;g., chemistry, materials science, and biology. Classical force fields and ab&#8197;initio calculations have been widely adopted in molecular simulations. However, these methods usually suffer from the drawbacks of either low accuracy or high cost. Recently, the development of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) has become more and more popular as they can tackle the problems in question and can deliver rather accurate results at significantly lower computational cost. In this review, the atomistic modeling of catalytic systems with the aid of MLIPs is discussed, showcasing recently developed MLIP models and selected applications for the modeling of heterogeneous catalytic systems. We also highlight the best practices and challenges for MLIPs and give an outlook for future works on MLIPs in the field of heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Stabilization Strategies of Lithium Metal Anode Toward Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 60, October 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the current issues of Li&#8722;S batteries were outlined. Then, we specially summarized the challenges of Li anode for Li&#8722;S, which included the heterogeneous deposition, unstable SEI layer and volume expansion. Furthermore, research progresses of stabilization strategies of Li anode (physical strategy, electrolyte optimization, surface protection layer and design of current collector) in Li&#8722;S batteries are highlighted.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries are considered as a most promising rechargeable lithium metal batteries because of their high energy density and low cost. However, the Li&#8722;S batteries mainly suffer the capacity decay issue caused by the shutting effect of lithium polysulfides and the safety issues arising from the Li dendrites formation. This review outlines the current issues of Li&#8722;S batteries. Furthermore, we comprehensively summarized the challenges encountered by Li anode in Li&#8722;S batteries, such as the heterogeneous deposition of the Li anode, the unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer, and volume expansion. Moreover, research progresses in the stabilization strategies of Li anodes (physical approaches, optimization of electrolyte, surface protection layer, and design of current collector) is discussed in detail. Lastly, the remaining challenges and future research directions of Li metal anode stabilization in Li&#8722;S batteries are also present.

         <title>Tutorial Review on the Set&#8208;Up and Running of Quantum Mechanical Cluster Models for Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 60, October 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Tutorial Review gives an overview on the set&#8208;up of QM cluster models that can be used for calculations on the mechanism of enzymatic reaction processes. Furthermore, recent examples are given that highlight the accuracy and reproducibility of the models and recommendations are given on best practice.







Abstract
Enzymes turnover substrates into products with amazing efficiency and selectivity and as such have great potential for use in biotechnology and pharmaceutical applications. However, details of their catalytic cycles and the origins surrounding the regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity of enzymatic reaction processes remain unknown, which makes the engineering of enzymes and their use in biotechnology challenging. Computational modelling can assist experimental work in the field and establish the factors that influence the reaction rates and the product distributions. A popular approach in modelling is the use of quantum mechanical cluster models of enzymes that take the first&#8208; and second coordination sphere of the enzyme active site into consideration. These QM cluster models are widely applied but often the results obtained are dependent on model choice and model selection. Herein, we show that QM cluster models can give highly accurate results that reproduce experimental product distributions and free energies of activation within several kcal mol&#8722;1, regarded that large cluster models with &gt;300 atoms are used that include key hydrogen bonding interactions and charged residues. In this tutorial review, we give general guidelines on the set&#8208;up and applications of the QM cluster method and discuss its accuracy and reproducibility. Finally, several representative QM cluster model examples on metal&#8208;containing enzymes are presented, which highlight the strength of the approach.

         <title>Preparation and Electrochemical Applications of Magn&#233;li Phase Titanium Suboxides: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 60, October 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magn&#233;li phase titanium suboxides (M&#8208;TSOs) possess a unique shear&#8208;plane structure that provides exceptional conductivity and corrosion resistance, making them ideal electrode materials for electrochemical applications. This review introduces the preparation methods, electrochemical performance, and applications of M&#8208;TSOs and discusses their challenges and future research directions.







Abstract
Magn&#233;li phase titanium suboxides (M&#8208;TSOs) belong to a type of sub&#8208;stoichiometric titanium oxides based on the crystal structure of rutile TiO2. They possess a unique shear structure, granting them exceptional electrical conductivity and corrosion resistance. These two advantages are crucial for electrode materials in electrochemistry, hence the significant interest from numerous researchers. However, the preparation of M&#8208;TSOs is uneconomic due to high temperature reduction and other complex synthesis process, thus limiting their practical application in electrochemical fields. This review delves into the crystal structure, properties, and synthesis methods of M&#8208;TSOs, and touches on their applications as electrocatalysts in wastewater treatment and electrochemical water splitting.

     alt="Preparation and Electrochemical Applications of Magn&#233;li Phase Titanium Suboxides: A Review"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magn&#233;li phase titanium suboxides (M-TSOs) possess a unique shear-plane structure that provides exceptional conductivity and corrosion resistance, making them ideal electrode materials for electrochemical applications. This review introduces the preparation methods, electrochemical performance, and applications of M-TSOs and discusses their challenges and future research directions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magn&#233;li phase titanium suboxides (M-TSOs) belong to a type of sub-stoichiometric titanium oxides based on the crystal structure of rutile TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. They possess a unique shear structure, granting them exceptional electrical conductivity and corrosion resistance. These two advantages are crucial for electrode materials in electrochemistry, hence the significant interest from numerous researchers. However, the preparation of M-TSOs is uneconomic due to high temperature reduction and other complex synthesis process, thus limiting their practical application in electrochemical fields. This review delves into the crystal structure, properties, and synthesis methods of M-TSOs, and touches on their applications as electrocatalysts in wastewater treatment and electrochemical water splitting. Furthermore, it highlights the research challenges and potential future research directions in M-TSOs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorine Labeling and 19F NMR Spectroscopy to Study Biological Molecules and Molecular Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy represents a key methodology for studying biomolecules and their interplay with other molecules. Recent developments in labeling strategies have made it possible to incorporate fluorine into proteins and peptides reliably, with manageable efforts and, importantly, in a highly site&#8208;specific manner. Paired with its excellent NMR spectroscopic properties and absence in most biological systems, fluorine has enabled scientists to investigate a rather wide range of scientific objectives, including protein folding, protein dynamics and drug discovery. Furthermore, NMR spectroscopic experiments can be conducted in complex environments, such as cell lysate or directly inside living cells. This review presents selected studies demonstrating how&#160;19F NMR spectroscopic approaches enable to contribute to the understanding of biomolecular processes. Thereby the focus has been set to labeling strategies available and specific NMR experiments performed to answer the underlying scientific objective.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;triggered ROS&#8208;responsive Supramolecular Nanoprodrugs for Targeted and Synergistic Chemo/photodynamic/gas Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo&#8208;triggered ROS&#8208;responsive supramolecular nanoprodrugs (BNN6@GBTC NPs) are constructed via supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic prodrug molecule (GBTC) and NO donor (BNN6). BNN6@GBTC NPs possess good stability, ROS responsiveness, and selective HepG2 cells targetability via overexpressed galactose receptors on the cell membrane. When BNN6@GBTC NPs are taken up by HepG2 cells, they can generate ROS upon light irradiation, which can not only be used for photodynamic therapy, but also cleave the thioketal linkage to release camptothecin for chemotherapy. Meanwhile, BNN6 triggering release NO for gas therapy. BNN6@GBTC NPs enable targeted and synergistic chemo/photodynamic/gas therapy, which results in reduced damage to normal cells and enhanced anti&#8208;cancer efficacy in vitro. This work provides a novel approach for the design of nanoprodrugs based on supramolecular self&#8208;assembly to achieve the multimodal synergistic anti&#8208;cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Chain&#8208;like Pentanuclear Complexes: Syntheses, Crystal Structures and Long&#8208;range Electronic Interactions of Cyanido&#8208;Bridged M2Ru3 (M = Fe, Ru)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we report the design and synthesis of two chain&#8208;like pentanuclear cyanido&#8208;bridged complexes trans&#8208;[Ru(bpy)2(&#956;&#8208;CN)2][cis&#8208;Ru(bpy)2(&#956;&#8208;NC)M(dppe)Cp*]2[PF6]4(M = Fe, 14+; M = Ru, 24+) and the electronic communication properties of their oxidized products 1m+ (m = 6, 7, 8) and 2n+ (n = 5, 6, 7, 8). The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis&#160;of 1m+ (m = 4, 6, 7) and 24+ show that 14+ and 24+ possess a Z&#8208;type array structure, 17+ is a U&#8208;type one, and 16+ exhibits both the types. The investigations indicate that both 1 and 2 show an extraordinarily strong electronic interaction between the two side Ru across the central NC&#8208;Ru&#8208;CN, leading to the formation of a fully delocalized cyanidometal Ru&#8208;Ru&#8208;Ru bridge for both three&#8208;electron oxidized states 17+ and 27+. Moreover, it should be noted that in 1 there exists no electronic interaction between the two terminal Fe ions. Upon substitution of Fe by Ru, however, 2 exhibits an electronic interaction between the two terminal metal ions across the trinuclear cyanidometal CN&#8208;Ru&#8208;NC&#8208;Ru&#8208;CN&#8208;Ru&#8208;NC bridge which is up to 20 &#197;.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Self&#8208;Assembly of Antibody&#8208;Rhamnose Complex as a Pre&#8208;Targeting Strategy for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enhancing the Fc effector functions of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is a proven strategy for improving cancer immunotherapy. In this study, we present a novel pre&#8208;targeting approach that integrates host&#8208;guest chemistry with an antibody&#8208;recruiting concept to create mAbs with superior effector functions. Using rituximab (RTX), a clinically approved anti&#8208;CD20 mAb, as our model, we modified RTX by conjugating it with adamantane (Ada) derivatives and various polyethylene glycol (PEG) linkers to produce RTX&#8208;Ada conjugates. These conjugates effectively formed RTX&#8208;rhamnose (Rha) complexes in situ through self&#8208;assembly, driven by host&#8208;guest interactions with Rha&#8208;modified &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin. This mechanism successfully redirected endogenous anti&#8208;Rha antibodies to target cells, enhancing the availability of Fc domains for improved effector functions, including complement&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). A structure&#8208;activity relationship study indicated that the potency of these in situ complexes was significantly influenced by the length of the PEG linker used; shorter PEG linkers correlated with higher CDC activity. Given the variability in endogenous antibody levels among individuals, this strategy presents a flexible and promising platform for enhancing the efficacy of mAb&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Regio&#8208;, Site&#8208; and Stereo&#8208;Selective Aziridination of Conjugated Dienes Enabled by Palladium/Copper/Iodide/Oxygen Cooperation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinylaziridines are important building blocks in organic chemistry, especially in the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. The direct and efficient transfer of an appropriate nitrogen source to readily accessible conjugated dienes is a notable methodology. The Pd&#8208;catalyzed oxidative 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of conjugated dienes through a &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;palladium species should be an ideal method for the selective synthesis of vinylaziridines. However, this method faces the challenge of regioselectivity, often resulting in 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization instead. In this study, we developed a Pd&#8208;catalyzed aerobic 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of conjugated dienes via a &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;palladium species to achieve regio&#8208;, site&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective aziridination under the synergistic effects of Pd(II), Cu(I), I&#8208;, and O2. The &#960;&#8208;allyl palladium species formed in the system undergoes an unusual iodination process, leading to the formation of an allyl iodide intermediate. Subsequently, the vinylaziridine is obtained through intramolecular SN2' substitution of the allyl iodide.</dc:description>

Subsequently, the vinylaziridine is obtained through intramolecular SN2' substitution of the allyl iodide.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Responsive Chirality: Tailoring Supramolecular Assemblies with External Stimuli as Future Platforms for Electronic/ Spintronic Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular chirality is the major branch of supramolecular chemistry, which not only plays important roles in biological processes but also in synthetically designed aggregated systems. &#160;To understand the complex processing of biological systems, the only way is to design supramolecular chiral ensembles that mimic natural biomolecules such as Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), Ribonucleic acid (RNA), amino acids, etc.&#160; In addition, chiral systems and self&#8208;assemblies as molecular motifs with breaking spatial inversion symmetry have been regarded as key substances in electronics and spintronics as well as in fundamental chemistry and physics. Here, in this review, our major concern is understanding modulation in spatial arrangements and packing modes under the impact of any external stimuli, which results in tailoring the handedness of resulted supramolecular chiral superstructures. We, in this review, highlighted the role of external stimuli such as solvent, chemical additives, photo exposure, etc. in altering the supramolecular chirality for their future utility as &#8220;active switches&#8221; in optoelectronic and spintronic devices and applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bifunctional catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are essential components of rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries. In this study, we synthesized a Pr0.5Ba0.5Mn0.8Co0.1Ru0.1O2.5+&#948; (PBMCRO) perovskite composite with in situ exsolved CoRu nanoparticles and Co&#8211;N&#8211;C, functioning as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for zinc&#8208;air batteries. The in situ exsolution of CoRu nanoparticles from the perovskite oxide was facilitated by the reducing action of 2&#8208;methylimidazole (2&#8208;MIM). Concurrently, Co&#8211;N&#8211;C was used to decorate PBMCRO, forming a novel bifunctional composite electrode of Co&#8211;N&#8211;C&#8211;PBMCRO. The incorporation of CoRu nanoparticles introduces a significant number of electrochemically active oxygen vacancies in the perovskite matrix, enhancing ORR and OER performance. Additionally, the Co&#8211;N&#8211;C synergistically improves electrochemical activity while preserving the structural stability of the perovskite oxide. The prepared Co&#8211;N&#8211;C&#8211;PBMCRO catalyst demonstrates significantly enhanced bifunctional performance compared to the undecorated pristine perovskite Pr0.5Ba0.5MnO3&#8211;&#948; (PBMO). The zinc&#8208;air battery with Co&#8211;N&#8211;C&#8211;PBMCRO catalyst achieve a peak power density of approximately 90 mW/cm2 and exhibit remarkable cycling stability for 788 h. This study presents a novel and effective strategy to enhance the catalytic performance of perovskite&#8208;based air electrodes for rechargeable metal&#8208;air batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>A Combined Experimental and Computational Exploration of Heteroleptic cis&#8208;Pd2L2L&#8217;2&#160;Coordination Cages through Geometric Complementarity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroleptic (mixed&#8208;ligand) coordination cages are of interest as host systems with more structurally and functionally complex cavities than homoleptic architectures. The design of heteroleptic cages, however, is far from trivial. In this work, we experimentally probed the self&#8208;assembly of Pd(II) ions with binary ligand combinations in a combinatorial fashion to search for new cis&#8208;Pd2L2L&#8217;2 heteroleptic cages. A hierarchy of computational analyses was then applied to these systems with the aim of elucidating key factors for rationalising self&#8208;assembly outcomes. Simple and inexpensive geometric analyses were shown to be effective in identifying complementary ligand pairs. Preliminary results demonstrated the viability of relatively rapid semi&#8208;empirical calculations for predicting the topology of thermodynamically favoured assemblies with rigid ligands, whilst more flexible systems proved challenging. Stemming from this, key challenges were identified for future work developing effective computational forecasting tools for self&#8208;assembled metallo&#8208;supramolecular systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Butafulvenes, together with pentafulvenes and [3]radialenes, form a series of constitutional benzene isomers in which aromaticity changes significantly and can be strongly substituent dependent. Butafulvene, as a member of this series, is frequently proposed to be antiaromatic. Based on butafulvenes Hopf, Zimmerman and coworkers first time described, derivatives thereof were synthesized and the effects of substituents on both the stability of the intermediate isobenzenes and on their optoelectronic and (anti)aromatic properties are discussed</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;stage Functionalization using a Popular Titrating Agent: Aryl&#8208;Chlorides and &#8208;Fluorides Activation by the Diphenylacetic Acid Dianion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl&#8208;chlorides and &#8208;fluorides are common building blocks, but their use in synthesis is limited by the high stability of their Ar&#8208;X bonds. The generation of aryl radicals via activation of strong Ar&#8208;X bonds is possible through the irradiation of tailor&#8208;made organic anions, which become reductants stronger than lithium metal. We report that the combination of visible light with the cheap diphenylacetic acid dianion is an even better tool, showing excellent activity across a variety of complex substrates and providing opportunities for late&#8208;stage drug modification. Ar&#8208;X bonds are chemoselectively activated in the presence of more easily reducible functions, such as Alk&#8208;Cl ones and carbonyl groups. These results pave the way to original synthetic strategies that would be otherwise considered impossible</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the numerous published syntheses and applications of sulfoximines, very few studies describe their physico&#8208;chemical properties and in particular their acidic, basic and lipophilic or hydrophilic characters. We report for the first time the acidity values (pKa) of fluorinated sulfoximines in water and in acetonitrile, as well as the basicity (pKaH) measurements of fluorinated and non&#8208;fluorinated sulfoximines in acetonitrile. The same sulfoximine library was also studied in terms of lipophilicity with measurement of the Hansch parameters of the sulfoximine moieties. Finally, these new data allowed us to optimize the N&#8208;alkylation reaction of fluorinated sulfoximines.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective cleavage of C&#8211;N bonds in N&#8208;containing compounds holds significant research value in organic synthesis, particularly for the synthesis of promising polynitrogen species. For instance, the discovery of the cyclo&#8208;pentazolate (cyclo&#8208;N5&#713;) anion in 2017 as a result of cleavage of the C&#8211;N bond has sparked interest within the field of high energy density materials. However, previous methods using ferrous glycinate and m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid generated the cyclo&#8208;N5&#713; anion in a low yield of 19.5% after 24 hours, and the mechanism remained unclear. In this study, we developed an efficient catalytic system comprising Mn (II) tetraphenylporphyrin and cumyl hydroperoxide. This system enables the cyclo&#8208;N5&#713; anion to be produced from 3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyphenylpentazole in 35.4% yield in 4 hours. Characterization of Mn(IV)&#8208;oxo porphyrins, &#8226;CH3, and &#8226;C8H8ON5 radicals provides evidence for the mechanism whereby the cyclo&#8208;N5&#713; anion forms. Our study underscores the competitive potential of radical&#8208;initiated selective C&#8211;N bonds cleavage in N&#8208;arylazoles and opens avenues for further exploration in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Target Fisher: a Consensus Structure&#8208;Based Target Prediction Tool, and its Application in the Discovery of Selective MAO&#8208;B Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work we introduce Target Fisher, a consensus structure&#8208;based target prediction tool that integrates molecular docking and machine learning with the aim to aid in the identification of potential biological targets and the optimization of the use of bioassays. Target Fisher uses per&#8208;residue energy decomposition profiles extracted from docking poses as fingerprints to train target&#8208;specific machine learning models. It provides predictions for a curated set of 37 protein targets, covering a diverse range of biological entities, and offers a user&#8208;friendly interface accessible via a web server (https://gqc.quimica.unlp.edu.ar/targetfisher/). In this sense, Target Fisher is a valuable tool to aid organic and medicinal chemistry groups in target identification, drug discovery and drug repurposing. As a case study, we demonstrate the efficacy of Target Fisher by screening a small library of assorted natural products for targets relevant to neurodegenerative diseases, which resulted in the identification and experimental validation of selective inhibitors of monoamine oxidase B (MAO&#8208;B).</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Buckybowls, bowl&#8208;shaped polyaromatic hydrocarbons, have received intensive interest owing to their multifaceted potentials in supramolecular chemistry and materials science. Buckybowls possess unique chemical and physical properties associated with their concave and convex faces. In view of the shape complementarity, which is one of the key factors for host&#8208;guest assembly, buckybowls are ideal receptors for fullerenes. In fact, the host&#8208;guest assembly between buckybowls and fullerenes is one of the most active topics in buckybowls chemistry, and the resulting supramolecular materials show promising applications in optoelectronics, biomaterials, and so forth. In this tutorial review, we present an overview for the progress on fullerene receptors based on buckybowls over the last decade.</dc:description>

         <title>Elevating Nonlinear Optical Response through d&#8208;electron Modulation in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electronic structure and excited state behavior is of pronounced influence on regulation of nonlinear optical (NLO) response. Herein, a serials of transition metal ions bearing different d&#8208;electron numbers were in situ coordinated within porphyrinic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), creating NLO&#8208;responsive M&#8208;metal (metal = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) frameworks. It demonstrated that the NLO properties can be optimized with the increased occupancy of the d&#8208;shell, which enhances the degree of delocalization. Specifically, the full&#8208;filled (d10) electron configuration of Zn2+ stabilizes the electronic structure, combination with &#960;&#8208;&#960;* local excitation character of M&#8208;Zn, promoting charge transfer process and resulting in outstanding NLO properties. Moreover, parameters related to the nonlinear process (&#946;, n2, Im&#967;(3), Re&#967;(3) and &#967;(3)) of M&#8208;Zn are calculated to be higher than those of other materials, consistent with theoretical calculations. This work paves the way for NLO modulation based on electronic analysis and provides a promising approach for constructing high&#8208;performance NLO materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A CH4&#8208;Driven Ion Cloud&#8208;Stretched Approach Enables ICP&#8208;qMS for Multiplex Single&#8208;Cell Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the last 40 years, inductively coupled plasma quadrupole (q) mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;qMS) has been recognized as one of the best tools for the quantification of multiple elements/isotopes and even the biomolecules they labeled in a homogeneous solution sample. However, it meets a tough challenge when acquiring multi&#8208;m/z signals from an intact single&#8208;cell dispersed in a cell suspension, since the single&#8208;cell ion cloud generated in ICP presents an intermittently transient event with a duration time of hundreds of microseconds while the dwell time plus settling time of the q is at the similar time scale when peak&#8208;hopping between different m/z. Herein, we report CH4 is able to stretch the single&#8208;cell ion cloud duration time to more than 7,000 &#956;s in collision&#8208;reaction&#8208;cell (CRC), allowing multi&#8208;m/z signals acquisition by ICP&#8208;qMS. Quantification of single&#8208;cell's multiple phenotype protein markers can thus be achieved on ICP&#8208;(CH4&#8208;CRC)&#8208;qMS, not only revealing the heterogeneity between the single cells but also enabling an unambiguous cell&#8208;classification of their subtypes. CH4&#8208;driven ion cloud&#8208;stretched approach breaks through the long&#8208;standing bottleneck limited single&#8208;cell multiplex analysis on ICP&#8208;qMS, paving a path&#160;for more important applications of ICP&#8208;qMS in the fields related to single&#8208;cell analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterometallic [2]Catenane&#8208;Crosslinked Supramolecular Networks with Improved Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of supramolecular networks with novel crosslinks is of great significance in expanding their chemical structures and exploring their advanced functions. Herein, we prepare a type of [2]catenane&#8208;cored supramolecular networks based on the crosslinking of polyethylene glycol (PEG) using a heterometallic [2]catenane unit. By adjusting the molecular weight of PEG, the solubility of the networks can be tuned and gels are formed using low molecular weight PEG. The introduction of heterometallic [2]catenane offers the networks good antibacterial properties owing to the synergistic antimicrobial activity of Pt(II) and Cu(I) ions in the [2]catenane. This study provides a simple and efficient strategy for constructing supramolecular networks with topological crosslinks as antibacterial materials, which will promote the structural design and biological applications of supramolecular networks.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Oriented External Electric Field in Altering Magnetic Exchange and Magnetic Anisotropy in Lanthanide&#8208;Radical Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnetic exchange coupling (J) is one of the important spin Hamiltonian parameters that control the magnetic characteristics of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). While numerous chemical methodologies have been proposed to modify ligands and control the J value, and magneto&#8208;structural correlations have been developed accordingly, altering this parameter through non&#8208;chemical means remains a challenging task. This study explores the impact of an Oriented&#8208;External Electric Field (OEEF) on over twenty lanthanide&#8208;radical complexes using Density Functional Theory (DFT) and ab initio Complete Active Space Self&#8208;Consistent Field (CASSCF) methods. Five complexes&#8212;[{(Me3Si)2N]2Gd(THF)}2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;N2)] (1), [Gd(Hbpz3)2(dtbsq)] (2), [Gd(hfac)3(IM&#8208;2py)] (3), [Gd(hfac)3(NITBzImH)] (4), and [Gd(hfac)3{2Py&#8208;NO}(H2O)] (5)&#8212;were selected for detailed analysis, revealing significant OEEF effects on magnetic exchange interactions and structural parameters. Various parameters such as bond distances, bond angles, and torsional angles were examined as a function of OEEF to establish guiding principles for molecule selection. In complexes 1, 2, and 3, OEEF influenced torsional angles and altered exchange interactions. Complex 4 demonstrated enhanced ferromagnetic coupling under OEEF, reaching a maximum J value of +5.3 cm&#8722;1. Complex 5 reveals switching the sign of JGd&#8208;rad exchange interaction from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic under OEEF, highlighting the potential of electric fields in designing materials with tuneable magnetic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Hollow Superhelices Based on Chiral Europium Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of helical nanotubes based on chiral coordination polymers (CPs) is an intriguing but challenging task, which is important for the development of functional materials that combine macroscopic chirality with tube&#8208;related properties. Here, we selected a chiral europium phosphonate system, e.g., Eu(NO3)3/R&#8208;,S&#8208;pempH2, and carried out a systematic work. By controlling the hydrothermal reaction conditions such as the pH value of the reaction mixture, the molar ratio and concentration of the reactants, we obtained block&#8208;like crystals of R/S&#8208;1b, rod&#8208;like crystals ofR/S&#8208;3r, hollow superhelices of R/S&#8208;2hh, and solid superhelices of R/S&#8208;4sh. In the latter two cases, the chirality has been successfully transferred and amplificated from the molecular level to the macroscopic level. Interestingly, compounds R/S&#8208;2hh and R/S&#8208;4sh have the same chemical composition of Eu(R/S&#8208;pempH)3&#215;2H2O and show identical PXRD patterns, thus can be considered as the same material except for different morphologies. We further investigated&#160;their circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties and found that the hollow superhelix of R/S&#8208;2hh had a larger dissymmetry factor than the solid superhelix of R/S&#8208;4sh. This study not only provides the first example of hollow superhelices of chiral CPs, but also offers the possibility of modulating the chiroptical properties of CPs through morphological control.</dc:description>

         <title>An Ultrahigh Affinity DNA Aptamer for Quinine and Its Intrinsic Fluorescence Based Label&#8208;free Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Measuring quinine is critical for the detection of its overdose, understanding its pharmacological and toxicological effects, and monitoring its pollution. While a previously reported aptamer named MN4 can bind quinine, it was not selected for it, leading to compromised binding affinity and specificity. In this work, a new quinine aptamer was isolated using the library immobilization capture&#8208;SELEX technique. The Q1 aptamer has a Kd value of 10 nM determined by an isothermal titration calorimetry experiment and 45 nM in a fluorescence binding assay. A 3.5 nM quinine limit of detection was obtained based on the aptamer binding&#8208;induced quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of quinine. A large blue shift in fluorescence was observed for quinine upon binding to Q1, whereas binding to MN4 led to a very small red shift, indicating different ways of quinine binding by these two aptamers. Q1 did not bind cocaine based on NMR spectroscopy and fluorescence assays also indicated excellent selectivity against other tested molecules. This work has supplied a high affinity aptamer for quinine that can be useful for its detection and fundamental aptamer binding studies. It also highlights the advantages of using capture&#8208;SELEX to isolate aptamers for small molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>The Future is Bright: The Emergence of Glassy Organic Dots for Biological Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glassy organic dots (g&#8208;Odots) are an emerging class of luminescent nanoparticles that offer enhanced photostability, superior brightness, and modular tunability compared to other commonly employed nanoparticles. In the last several years, they have been used as bioimaging probes for single&#8208; and multi&#8208;photon cellular imaging, exhibiting low cytotoxicity even after several days. While they are emerging as promising materials for use in biological applications, g&#8208;Odots face several key challenges before their use can become widespread. In this concept, we outline the state of the literature on g&#8208;Odots and highlight a few ways in which their design and use can be improved upon.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of Advanced Microscopy Techniques to The Characterization of Mixed Matrix Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) have emerged as promising materials for various separation processes due to their tunable properties, enhanced separation performance and reproducibility. In this review paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the methodologies, challenges, and applications associated with the characterization of MMMs using two advanced imaging techniques: Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB&#8208;SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). We begin by outlining the principles and capabilities of FIB&#8208;SEM and TEM, emphasizing their suitability for studying the microstructure, morphology, and composition of MMMs at nanoscale resolution. Subsequently, we discuss the specific challenges and limitations encountered in the characterization of MMMs using these techniques, including sample preparation, image acquisition, and data interpretation. Furthermore, we review the diverse applications of FIB&#8208;SEM and TEM in elucidating the structure&#8208;property relationships of MMMs. Through illustrative examples, we highlight the valuable insights gained from these imaging techniques in optimizing MMMs for various separation applications. Finally, we propose future directions and emerging trends in MMM characterization, including the integration of lasers into FIB&#8208;SEM and in situ characterization techniques, to address current challenges and push the boundaries of MMM design and performance.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Physisorption&#8208;based separation processes represents a promising alternative to the conventional thermally driven methods, such as cryogenic separation. However, a significant challenge lies in balancing the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and selectivity of adsorbents. In this study, we introduce a novel fluorinated&#8208;anion pillared metal&#8208;organic frameworks (APMOFs) featuring a dual&#8208;pore architecture, constructed using a pyridine&#8208;oxazole bifunctional ligand. The inherent low symmetry of the ligand leads to significant distortion of the fluorinated&#8208;anion pillars, resulting in a distinctive type of APMOFs characterized by dual&#8208;pore architecture. On pore structure with constrict pore width is enriched with a high density of anion fluorinated pillars, offering numerous active sites advantageous for enhancing separation selectivity. Concurrently, the other pore structure exhibits larger dimensions, facilitating increased gas molecule accommodation and thereby augmenting adsorption capacity. Gas sorption studies reveal a substantial C2H2 adsorption capacity and a high C2H2/CO2 separation selectivity. Breakthrough experiments confirm its exceptional separation performance, while theoretical investigations elucidate a sequential adsorption process within these APMOFs, underscoring the efficacy of this strategy in overcoming trade&#8208;off limits in adsorbents.</dc:description>

         <title>Comparative analysis of tetravalent actinide Schiff base complexes: influence of donor and ligand backbone on molecular geometry and metal binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of isostructural early actinide AnIV complexes was synthesized in order to investigate the influence of a conjugated framework in the ligand backbone on An bonding. Therefore, the AnIV complexes [An(pyrophen)2] (An = Th, U, Np, and Pu) with the pure N&#8208;donor ligand bis(2&#8208;pyrrolecarbonylaldehyde)&#8208;o&#8208;phenylenediamine referred to as pyrophen, were synthesized and characterized. Solid state analysis via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD) reveals two sets of ligands binding in an almost orthogonal arrangement to the actinide center. For the larger actinides Th and U, the coordination sphere allows for additional coordination by a solvent molecule. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) studies show the presence of highly symmetrical complexes in solution in good agreement with the solvent&#8208;free solid structures. While SC&#8208;XRD suggests mainly ionic binding, an analysis of paramagnetic NMR contributions and quantum chemical bond analysis hint towards significant covalency in the U, Np, and Pu compounds. This series of An complexes allowed for a thorough structural and theoretical comparison of a conjugated system to a closely related N&#8208;donor ligand (pyren)[1], as well as to the mixed N,O Schiff base ligands salophen (conjugated) and salen (non&#8208;conjugated).</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Pnictogen and Ligand Framework on the Lewis Acidity and Steric Environment in Pnictogen Pincer Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pnictogen pincer complexes are a fascinating class of compounds due to their dynamic molecular and electronic structures, and valuable stoichiometric or catalytic reactivity. As recognition of their unique chemistry has grown, so too has the library of pincer ligands employed and pnictogen centres engaged to prepare them. Here we computationally study how the choice of pincer ligand framework and pnictogen influence the electronic and steric outcomes of the complexes obtained. The most relevant electronic parameter is the pnictogen&#8208;centred electrophilicity, which has been quantified by fluoride ion affinities and LUMO energies, while the most relevant steric parameter is the crowding around the central pnictogen, which has been quantified by the %Vbur values and visualized using steric maps. The resulting trends are analyzed with reference to binding pocket size, acceptor orbital type, electronic delocalization, &#960;&#8208;donor strengths, and heteroatom incorporation. Thus, considering 16 ligand frameworks and 4 heavy pnictogen centres, this study provides a broad&#8208;spectrum view of stereo&#8208;electronic variation in pnictogen pincer complexes, which, together with a recent study on geometric variation in the same family, provides a substantial dataset to guide future molecular design and reactivity studies.</dc:description>

         <title>PnictogenIII&#160;Dications Supported by BZIMPY Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two homologous series of pnictogen(III) dications, stabilized by 2,6&#8208;bis(benzimidazole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine ligands have been prepared. Both series contain PnIII&#8722;X moieties (Pn = P, As, Sb, Bi; X = Cl or Ph) and have been fully characterized using spectroscopic methods including X&#8208;ray crystallography. The Lewis acidity of these compounds has also been probed by computational methods; the results suggest that the dictations are strong Lewis acids, with the PnCl2+ compounds being more acidic than the PnPh2+ compounds, and with Lewis acidity increasing from P to Bi, in both series. The PhP2+&#8208;containing compound was also found to be a versatile PIII transfer reagent, leading to new synthetic routes for various PhP&#8208;containing compounds. The redox chemistry of all compounds has also been probed using cyclic voltammetry and chemical reductions. In some cases the resulting PnI moieties could be trapped using diazabutadienes.</dc:description>

         <title>C(sp2)&#8208;Arylsulfones Directly from Arylsulfonyl Chlorides with Boronic Acids by Photoactivation of Boosted EDA Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Directly with arylsulfonyl chlorides, a green and efficient deborylativesulfonylation of aryl(alkenyl)boronic acids has been developed to access both diarylsulfones and vinylarylsulfones in moderate to excellent yields at room temperature under visible&#8208;light irradiation. This protocol features broad C(sp2)&#8208;arylsulfone applicability, simple operation, accessibility of raw materials and ease of scale&#8208;up. The key to the success of this photoredox transformation is introducing catalytic amounts of additives, naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ols, thus boosting the formed electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes, which can dramatically improve not only the reaction efficiency but also the selectivity. This strategy&#160;was inspired and derived from specific substrates, representing a rare paradigm of how to exploit a more general reaction system. Moreover, extensive control experiments provide insights into the proposed mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>A Sodium Metal&#8722;Organic Framework with Deep Blue Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is a great challenge to manufacture room&#8208;temperature blue long afterglow phosphorescent materials adapted to environmental conditions. Herein, an Na&#8208;based metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) was constructed using Na+ and 1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;3,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid, which exhibits long&#8208;lived of 378.9 ms, deep blue and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence, meanwhile possesses the visible blue afterglow for 3~6 seconds after removing excitation light source. The three&#8208;dimensional coordination bonds network provided by Na&#8208;based MOF protects the organic ligands intrinsic hydrogen bond network, resulting in the phosphor lifetime and residual color remaining unchanged in different gas atmospheres. Furthermore, first&#8208;principles time&#8208;dependent density functional theory reveals that the rigid Na&#8208;based MOF structure can limit the rotation and vibration of the room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent organic ligands. This limitation results in the suppression of non&#8208;radiative decay for both singlet and triplet excitons, promotes intersystem crossing, and increases the rate of radiative decay, ultimately achieving long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulatory Mechanisms and Synergistic Enhancement of the Diiron YtfE Protein in Nitric Oxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The diiron&#8208;containing YtfE protein in Escherichia coli is pivotal in counteracting nitrosative stress, a critical barrier to bacterial viability. This study delves into the biochemical complexity governing YtfE's conversion of nitric oxide (NO) to nitrous oxide, a key process for alleviating nitrosative stress. Through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, we explored YtfE's molecular structure, with a particular focus on two internal transport tunnels important for its activity. Our findings illuminate Tunnel 1 as the primary conduit for substrate transport, regulated by conformational shifts within the N&#8208;terminal domain that enable substrate access to the diiron core in the C&#8208;terminal domain. Tunnel 2 emerges as a secondary, supportive route, activated when Tunnel 1 is compromised. This result challenges a previous model of distinct tunnels for substrate entry and product exit, suggesting both tunnels are capable of transporting substrates and products. Our engineering efforts enhanced the role of Tunnel 2, enabling a synergistic operation with Tunnel 1 and tripling YtfE's enzymatic activity compared to its wild&#8208;type form. This research not only deepens our understanding of YtfE&#8217;s regulatory mechanism for NO reduction but also introduces a strategy to amplify its enzymatic efficiency. The outcomes offer new ravenues for modulating bacterial stress responses.</dc:description>

         <title>Physicochemical Analysis of Cu(II)&#8208;Driven Electrochemical CO2 Reduction and its Competition with Proton Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reduction of CO2 has become a key role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in efforts to search for long&#8208;term responses to climate change. We report a a couple of CO2&#8208;reducing molecular catalysts based on earth&#8208;abundant copper complexes. These are [Cu(DPA)(PyNAP)] (1) and [Cu(DPA)(PyQl)] (2) (where, DPA = pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxylic acid, PyNAP = 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthyridine, and PyQl = 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)quinoline). The copper metal&#8208;catalysed 2&#8208;electron reduction of CO2 to CO in the presence of 2&#8208;protons is challenging. These catalysts exhibit the production of CO gas in DMF/water mixtures, achieving an impressive faradaic efficiency of&#160; 84% and 72% for complex 1 and 2 at &#8208;1.7 V vs. SCE, respectively, for selective CO2 reduction. The production of H2 due to 2H+ + 2e&#8208; was also observed as a byproduct through the competitive proton reduction reaction. This was cross&#8208;verified by online gas and mass analysis.&#160;&#160;Our investigations confirmed the stability of the electrocatalysts under the electrocatalytic conditions. The mechanistic pathways were proposed to work with the EECC and ECEC (E: electrochemical and C: chemical) mechanisms. A CO2 insertion into an in&#8208;situ generated hydride from the Cu&#8208;center generates CO through the favourable path.</dc:description>

         <title>From Double&#8208;Stranded Helicates to Abiotic Double Helical Supramolecular Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The folding of oligomeric strands is the method that nature has selected to generate ordered assemblies presenting spectacular functions. In the purpose to mimic these biomacro&#8208;molecules and extend their properties and functions, chemists make important efforts to prepare artificial secondary, tertiary, and even quarternary structures based on folded abiotic backbones. A large variety of oligomers and polymers, encoded with chemical informations, were designed, synthesized and characterized, and the establishment of non&#8208;covalent interactions lead to complex and functional supramolecular architectures resulting from a spontaneous self&#8208;assembly process. The association of comple&#8208;mentary molecular strands into double helical structures is a common structural pattern of nucleic acids and proteins, so the synthesis of bio&#8208;inspired double helices has emerged as an important subject. In recent years, a number of synthetic oligo&#8208;mers have been reported to form stable double helices and it was shown that the equilibrium between single and double helices can be controlled via different stimuli like the modification of the solvent or the temperature. This kind of structure presents highly interesting functions, such as molecular recognition within the cavity of double helices, and some other potential applications will emerge in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental and computational studies of steric factors in the isomerization of internal alkynes within the coordination environment of half&#8208;sandwich metal complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The isomerization of internal alkynes Ar1C&#8801;CAr2 within the coordination environment of low&#8208;valent half&#8208;sandwich [Ru(dppe)Cp]+ complexes via a 1,2&#8208;migration process affords vinylidene species [Ru{=C=C(Ar1)Ar2}(dppe)Cp]+. The rearrangement reactions of symmetrically and asymmetrically substituted substrates featuring different electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing groups and of varying steric bulk were modelled using density functional theory (DFT), and the conclusions supported by experimental observations. Examination of the reaction pathway and associated activation barriers reveal a high solvent dependency for the generation of the key intermediate species [Ru(dppe)Cp]+ from [RuCl(dppe)Cp] by Na+ induced halide abstraction , with the lattice enthalpy of the NaCl by&#8208;product playing a critical role in the overall thermochemical balance of the reaction. The activation barriers associated with the reaction of [Ru(dppe)Cp]+ with Ar1C&#8801;CAr2, and the relative energies of the alkyne complexes [Ru(h2&#8208;Ar1C&#8801;CAr2)(dppe)Cp]+, are sensitive to the electron density of the alkyne and conformational changes associated with the &#8216;bend&#8208;back&#8217; of the substrate. The latter differs by up to 66.1 kJ/mol, which in turn impacts the barrier height of the subsequent 1,2&#8208;migration step . The relative importance of these factors is evinced by the successful rearrangement of the very sterically congested 1(9&#8208;anthryl)&#8208;2(9&#8208;phenanthryl) acetylene into the fully characterized diaryl vinylidene complex, which was isolated in 89% yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Hydrogenation of an Insulated Diarylacetylene Dimer Incorporated as Axle Molecules in a Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based [c2]Daisy Chain Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The [c2]daisy chain rotaxane is an attractive interlocked molecule for the development of functional materials because of its unique mechanical properties that respond to various external stimuli, resulting in extension and contraction motions along the molecular axis. The synthesis of several &#8216;impossible&#8217; [2]rotaxanes that do not exhibit obvious binding motifs between their axle and wheel moieties has been achieved through further chemical modification of their axle moieties within pre&#8208;prepared [2]rotaxanes. However, no &#8216;impossible&#8217; [c2]daisy chain rotaxane has been synthesized using similar strategies until now. In this study, we investigated the hydrogenation of diarylacetylene moieties within a permethylated &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (PM &#945;&#8208;CD)&#8208;based [c2]daisy chain rotaxane using Pd/C or Pd/CaCO3 under hydrogen. A new [c2]daisy chain rotaxane featuring two diarylethane moieties was successfully synthesized through the simultaneous full hydrogenation of the insulated diarylacetylene moieties under optimized conditions. The new rotaxane is classified as an &#8216;impossible&#8217; [c2]daisy chain rotaxane due to the lack of obvious binding motifs between diarylethane and the PM &#945;&#8208;CD. This work demonstrates for the first time that the insulated axle moieties of [c2]daisy chain rotaxanes can undergo novel chemical modifications using a synthetic strategy employing transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation, which can potentially advance the development of nanoarchitectures with functional interlocked molecules.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>[1.1][n]Paracyclophanes ([1.1][n]PCPs) (3) with n = 2, 3, and 4, which consist of two&#160;[n]paraphenylene units connected by methylene bridges, were synthesized using short synthetic pathways with good overall yields. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses reveal that the paraphenylene unit in 3 is bent, resulting in an elliptic core structure of 3.

         <title>Pure Shift NMR in Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flow NMR is an expanding analytical approach with applications that include in&#8208;line analysis for process control and optimisation, and real&#8208;time reaction monitoring. The samples monitored by flow NMR are typically mixtures that yield complex 1D&#160;1H spectra. &#8220;Pure shift&#8221; NMR is a powerful approach to simplifying&#160;1H NMR spectra, but its standard implementation is not compatible with continuous flow because of interference between sample motion and the position&#8208;dependent spin manipulations that are required in pure shift NMR. Here we show that pure shift NMR spectra can be successfully collected for continuously flowing samples, thanks to an adapted acquisition scheme, robust solvent suppression, and a velocity&#8208;compensation strategy. The resulting method is used to collect ultrahigh resolution reaction monitoring data. Pure shift NMR spectra are expected to benefit many applications of flow NMR.</dc:description>
