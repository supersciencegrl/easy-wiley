         <title>Impact of Heterocycle Annulation on NIR Absorbance in Quinoid Thioacene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 23, April 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homologous series of quinoid bisimidazolylidene&#8208;derived thioacenes has been synthesised and investigated for their optoelectronic and magnetic properties. All investigated small&#8208;band&#8208;gap quinoids show stability at room temperature in the presence of oxygen and display strong NIR absorption. Three&#8208; and fourfold annulated quinoids display partially open&#8208;shell singlet diradical character.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterisation of a homologous series of quinoid sulfur&#8208;containing imidazolyl&#8208;substituted heteroacenes is described. The optoelectronic and magnetic properties were investigated by UV/vis, fluorescence and EPR spectroscopy as well as quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, and were compared to those of the corresponding benzo congener. The room&#8208;temperature and atmospherically stable quinoids display strong absorption in the NIR region between 678 and 819&#8197;nm. The dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene and the thieno[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:4,5]thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thieno[2,3&#8208;d]thiophene derivatives were EPR active at room temperature. For the latter, variable&#8208;temperature EPR spectroscopy revealed the presence of a thermally accessible triplet state, with a singlet&#8208;triplet separation of 14.1&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature Quantum Tunneling and Hydrogen Bonding Rearrangements Characterize the Solid&#8208;Solid Phase Transitions in a Phosphonium&#8208;Based Protic Ionic Liquid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 23, April 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tunneling driven dynamics of the d3&#8208;octyl phosphonium cation in an ionic liquid is observed by means of solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. Deuteron line&#8208;shape analysis and relaxation time measurements provide information about the structure, mobility and rearrangements of the cations for the broad temperature range between 73 and 343&#8197;K. Differently strong hydrogen bonds are reported for the solid, supercooled and liquid state of the IL and map the change in molecular ordering upon phase transformation.







Abstract
We report the complex phase behavior of the glass forming protic ionic liquid (PIL) d3&#8208;octylphosphonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [C8H17PD3][NTf2] by means of solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. Combined line shape and spin relaxation studies of the deuterons in the PD3 group of the octylphosphonium cation allow to map and correlate the phase behavior for a broad temperature range from 71&#8197;K to 343&#8197;K. In the solid PIL at 71&#8197;K, we observed a static state, characterized by the first deuteron quadrupole coupling constant reported for PD3 deuterons. A transition enthalpy of about 12&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 from the static to the mobile state with increasing temperature suggests the breaking of a weak, charge&#8208;enhanced hydrogen bond between cation and anion. The highly mobile phase above 100&#8197;K exhibits an almost disappearing activation barrier, strongly indicating quantum tunneling. Thus, we provide first evidence of tunneling driven mobility of the hydrogen bonded P&#8722;D moieties in the glassy state of PILs, already at surprisingly high temperatures up to 200&#8197;K. Above 250&#8197;K, the mobile phase turns from anisotropic to isotropic motion, and indicates strong internal rotation of the PD3 group. The analyzed line shapes and spin relaxation times allow us to link the structural and dynamical behavior at molecular level with the phase behavior beyond the DSC traces.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis for a Wide Variety of Patellamide Derivatives and Phosphatase Activity of Copper&#8208;Patellamide Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 23, April 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient synthetic procedure for natural and artificial patellamides, found in the ascidians of the Great Barrier Reef, is presented. These macrocycles are known to tightly bind CuII, and the variety of easily available patellamide derivatives allows to carefully study the reactivity as a function of the structure of the macrocycle. This has been done by experiment and DFT for phosphatase activity as a possible reaction of metabolic relevance.







Abstract
Copper complexes of patellamides have shown catalytic activity in a variety of reactions but their biological function remains unknown. There are significant differences between the natural macrocycles and synthetic analogues in the various catalytic activities. It therefore is essential to be able to perform in&#8197;vivo and ex vivo reference measurements with the natural patellamide macrocycles, very similar derivatives and a large range of synthetic analogues. The preparative method described allows for a highly adaptable synthetic process producing building blocks for a large range of patellamide derivatives: apart from natural compounds, a new synthetic patellamide was prepared that does not have any substituents at any of the four heterocycles. Together with the variation of substituents at the aliphatic backbone, this allowed to elucidate the catalytic activity for phosphoester hydrolysis as a function of the structure and dynamics of the dicopper(II)&#8208;patellamide complexes, both by experiment and DFT&#8208;based mechanistic studies.

A regioselective [3+3] annulation of alkynyl ketimines with &#945;&#8208;cyano ketones for the synthesis of polysubstituted 4H&#8208;pyran derivatives with a quaternary CF3&#8208;containing center has been realized by using Cu(OAc)2 as a catalyst, providing the desired products in up to 99&#8201;% yield. The method tolerates some variations in the &#945;&#8208;CF3 alkynyl ketimines and &#945;&#8208;cyano ketones scope. The products could be synthesized on a gram&#8208;scale and several products were conveniently transformed.







Abstract
Regioselective [3+3] annulation of alkynyl ketimines with &#945;&#8208;cyano ketones for the synthesis of polysubstituted 4H&#8208;pyran derivatives with a quaternary CF3&#8208;containing center has been realized by using Cu(OAc)2 as the catalyst. The novel strategy tolerates a wide range of &#945;&#8208;CF3 alkynyl ketimines and &#945;&#8208;cyano ketones with both aryl and alkyl substitutents. A preliminary asymmetric synthesis of chiral product 3 has been attempted by using copper and chiral thiourea as the cocatalyst with excellent yields (86&#8208;99&#8201;%) and good enantioselectivities (71&#8211;78&#8201;% ee). Furthermore, product 3&#8201;aa could be obtained on a gram&#8208;scale reaction with 75&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee after recrystallization. Several products were also transformed readily. Control experiments indicate that the reaction involves a process with a base&#8208;catalyzed or chiral thiourea&#8208;catalyzed Mannich&#8208;type reaction followed by a highly regioselective copper&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing reaction on the alkynyl moiety in a 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig fashion.

The method tolerates some variations in the &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; alkynyl ketimines and &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-cyano ketones scope.

&lt;p&gt;Regioselective [3+3] annulation of alkynyl ketimines with &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-cyano ketones for the synthesis of polysubstituted 4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-pyran derivatives with a quaternary CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-containing center has been realized by using Cu(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the catalyst. The novel strategy tolerates a wide range of &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; alkynyl ketimines and &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-cyano ketones with both aryl and alkyl substitutents. A preliminary asymmetric synthesis of chiral product &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; has been attempted by using copper and chiral thiourea as the cocatalyst with excellent yields (86-99&#8201;%) and good enantioselectivities (71&#8211;78&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;).

Several products were also transformed readily. Control experiments indicate that the reaction involves a process with a base-catalyzed or chiral thiourea-catalyzed Mannich-type reaction followed by a highly regioselective copper-catalyzed ring-closing reaction on the alkynyl moiety in a 6&lt;i&gt;-endo&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;dig&lt;/i&gt; fashion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Out with the old, in with the new: Perylene monoimide has long been in the shadow of its famous sibling: perylene diimide. And this, despite its talents! In this study, perylene monoimide takes the spotlight and it has things to tell.







Abstract
A series of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors based on perylene monoimides coupled in the peri position through phenylene linkers were synthesized via Suzuki&#8208;coupling reactions. Various substitution patterns were investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations in combination with experimental data to elucidate the geometry and their optical and electrochemical properties. Further investigations of the bulk properties with grazing incidence wide angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS) gave insight into the stacking behavior of the acceptor thin films. Electrochemical and morphological properties correlate with the photovoltaic performance of devices with the polymeric donor PBDB&#8208;T and a maximum efficiency of 3.17&#8201;% was reached. The study gives detailed information about structure&#8211;property relationships of perylene&#8208;linker&#8208;perylene compounds.

Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is sustainably and efficiently recycled into porous carbon monolith with N,O co&#8208;doped structure by a solid&#8208;base&#8208;assisted low&#8208;temperature solvothermal dehalogenation. The dual&#8208;promoted conversion of solid&#8208;base catalyst and solvent decomposition can boost the dechlorination of PVC and increase the carbon yield. The upgraded metal&#8208;free porous carbon has good electrocatalytic hydrogen production capacity. This method provides a new strategy for low&#8208;temperature recycling upgrades for halogen&#8208;containing wastes.







Abstract
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is widely used in daily life, but its waste has become a serious environmental problem. A solid base assisted low&#8208;temperature solvothermal dehalogenation was developed in this work to sustainably and efficiently transform PVC into high&#8208;value dimethylamine hydrochloride (DMACl) chemical and N,O co&#8208;doped carbon monolith with hierarchically porous structure. The synergistic promotion of solid&#8208;base catalyst and solvent decomposition with the removal of HCl can shift forward the chemical equilibrium to promote the dechlorination of PVC and increase the carbon yield. Meanwhile, the solid&#8208;base catalyst can also act as a pore&#8208;forming additive to fabricate the carbon monolith with hierarchical pores. Induced by the high specific surface area, hierarchical pores and N,O co&#8208;doped structure, the generated carbon monolith exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance towards H2 evolution. These discoveries shed light on the design of synergistically coupled solvent and solid catalyst to promote the heterogeneous conversion of waste chlorinated plastics into high&#8208;value chemicals for a sustainable future.

1,1,4,4&#8208;Tetracyanobutadienes (TCBDs) derived from ynamides and bearing diverse fluorene&#8208;based chromophores or other tricyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were prepared. The conceived sulfonamido&#8208;TCBDs showed remarkable photophysical properties covering a large range of wavelengths from the visible region to the NIR. They displayed an environment&#8208;sensitive emission that was observed in nonpolar solvents and in the solid state but was very weak in dichloromethane. Quantum yields in cyclohexane reached values up to 7.8&#8201;%.







Abstract
1,1,4,4&#8208;Tetracyanobutadienes (TCBDs) bearing a large diversity of fluorophores were prepared following a multi&#8208;step synthesis. In a crucial last step, all compounds were obtained from the corresponding ynamides, which were particularly suitable for the formation of the TCBDs in the presence of tetracyanoethylene via a [2+2] cycloaddition/retroelectrocyclization step (CA&#8208;RE). Several fluorenyl derivatives in addition to phenanthrenyl and terphenyl ones provided ynamide&#8208;based TCBDs affording remarkable emission properties covering a large range of wavelengths. Those compounds emit both in solid state and in solution from the visible region to the NIR range, depending on the molecular structures. Quantum yields in cyclohexane reached unforeseen values for such derivatives, up to 7.8&#8201;%. A huge sensitivity to the environment of the TCBDs has also been unraveled for most of the compounds since we observed a dramatic fall of the quantum yields when changing the solvent from cyclohexane to toluene, while they are almost non&#8208;emissive in dichloromethane.

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Chemisorption, Interpenetration and Polycatenation: Cationic MOFs and CPs from Group 13 Metal Halides and Di&#8208;Pyridyl&#8208;Linkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 23, April 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of iodides and bromides of Al, Ga and In with dipyridyl ligands under various conditions lead to a large number of products including cationic two&#8208;dimensional MOFs that exhibit interpenetration and polycatenation. Charge compensation is achieved via tetra&#8208;halido&#8208;metal anions and iodide anions. The latter allows for chemisorption of I2 under formation of I3&#8722; suitable for the capture of radioisotopes of iodine.







Abstract
Eight cationic, two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) were synthesized in reactions of the group 13 metal halides AlBr3, AlI3, GaBr3, InBr3 and InI3 with the dipyridyl ligands 1,2&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethylene (bpe), 1,2&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane (bpa) and 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (bipy). Seven of them follow the general formula 2&#8734;[MX2(L)2]A, M=Al, In, X=Br, I, A&#8722;=[MX4]&#8722;, I&#8722;, I3&#8722;, L=bipy, bpa, bpe. Thereby, the porosity of the cationic frameworks can be utilized to take up the heavy molecule iodine in gas&#8208;phase chemisorption vital for the capture of iodine radioisotopes. This is achieved by switching between I&#8722; and the polyiodide I3&#8722; in the cavities at room temperature, including single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation. The MOFs are 2D networks that exhibit (4,4)&#8208;topology in general or (6,3)&#8208;topology for 2&#8734;[(GaBr2)2(bpa)5][GaBr4]2&#8901;bpa. The two&#8208;dimensional networks can either be arranged to an inclined interpenetration of the cationic two&#8208;dimensional networks, or to stacked networks without interpenetration. Interpenetration is accompanied by polycatenation. Due to the cationic character, the MOFs require the counter ions [MX4]&#8722;, I&#8722; or I3&#8722; counter ions in their pores. Whereas the [MX4]&#8722;, ions are immobile, iodide allows for chemisorption.

     alt="Iodine-Chemisorption, Interpenetration and Polycatenation: Cationic MOFs and CPs from Group 13 Metal Halides and Di-Pyridyl-Linkers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reactions of iodides&lt;/b&gt; and bromides of Al, Ga and In with dipyridyl ligands under various conditions lead to a large number of products including cationic two-dimensional MOFs that exhibit interpenetration and polycatenation. Charge compensation is achieved via tetra-halido-metal anions and iodide anions. The latter allows for chemisorption of I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under formation of I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; suitable for the capture of radioisotopes of iodine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight cationic, two-dimensional metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) were synthesized in reactions of the group 13 metal halides AlBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, AlI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, GaBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, InBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and InI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with the dipyridyl ligands 1,2-di(4-pyridyl)ethylene (&lt;i&gt;bpe&lt;/i&gt;), 1,2-di(4-pyridyl)ethane (&lt;i&gt;bpa&lt;/i&gt;) and 4,4&#8217;-bipyridine (&lt;i&gt;bipy&lt;/i&gt;). Seven of them follow the general formula &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;&#8734;&lt;/sub&gt;[MX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]A, M=Al, In, X=Br, I, A&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;=[MX&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;i&gt;L=bipy, bpa, bpe&lt;/i&gt;. Thereby, the porosity of the cationic frameworks can be utilized to take up the heavy molecule iodine in gas-phase chemisorption vital for the capture of iodine radioisotopes. This is achieved by switching between I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and the polyiodide I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in the cavities at room temperature, including single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation. The MOFs are 2D networks that exhibit (4,4)-topology in general or (6,3)-topology for &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;&#8734;&lt;/sub&gt;[(GaBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;bpa&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;][GaBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;i&gt;bpa&lt;/i&gt;. The two-dimensional networks can either be arranged to an inclined interpenetration of the cationic two-dimensional networks, or to stacked networks without interpenetration. Interpenetration is accompanied by polycatenation. Due to the cationic character, the MOFs require the counter ions [MX&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; or I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; counter ions in their pores. Whereas the [MX&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, ions are immobile, iodide allows for chemisorption. Furthermore, eight additional coordination polymers and complexes were identified and isolated that elaborate the reaction space of the herein reported syntheses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Factors Governing the Catalytic Insertion of CO2 into Arenes &#8211; A DFT Case Study for Pd and Pt Phosphane Sulfonamido Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 23, April 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Which catalyst does the job? A DFT based catalyst screening with Pd/Pt complexes for the catalytic direct insertion of CO2 into the C&#8722;H bonds of arenes to provide a carbonic acid indicates that a catalytic process might well be achievable, when the multi&#8208;parameter system is carefully tuned. Not only the choice of metal is important, also the size and shape as well as the electronic influences of the ligand and the electronic influences of the substrate needs to be concerned. The appropriate base also must be found and some undesired side reactions must be suppressed.







Abstract
The potential of Pd/Pt complexes for catalytic carboxylation of arenes with CO2 is investigated by means of computational chemistry. Recently we reported that the bis[(2&#8208;methoxyphenyl)phosphino]&#8208;benzenesulfonamido palladium complex 1 inserts CO2 reversibly in its Pd&#8722;C(aryl) bond generating carboxylato complex 2. In the present work we study how geometric and electronic factors of various ligands and substrates influence the overall activation barrier (energy span, ES) of a potential catalytic cycle for arene carboxylation comprising this elementary step. The tendency of the key intermediates to dimerize and thus deactivating the potential catalysts is examined as well as the role of the base, which inevitably is needed to stabilize the reaction product. We show that Pd and Pt complexes I(Pd)&#8208;L16&#8208;S1 and I(Pt)&#8208;L16&#8208;S1 do not dimerize, enable the computation of complete catalytic cycles, and show interestingly low ES values of 26.8 and 24.5&#8197;kcal/mol, respectively.

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclopropenes and Fluorinated Cyclopropanes via Michael Initiated Ring Closure of Alkyl Triflones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 23, April 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various cyclopropenes and fluorinated cyclopropanes were prepared from readily available alkyl triflones and electron&#8208;deficient alkenes via a Michael addition initiated ring closure (MIRC) process. This protocol not only has a broad substrates scope but also achieves good chemical yields and moderate diastereoselectivity. The mechanism may involve tandem Michael addition of triflones/intramolecular nucleophilic cyclization (elimination of &#8208;SO2CF3)/elimination of fluoride.







Abstract
A facile synthesis of cyclopropenes and fluorinated cyclopropanes from readily available alkyl triflones was developed. The reaction, regardless of electronic effect, gave products in good to excellent yields and moderate diastereoselectivity. The mechanism may involve tandem Michael addition of triflones/intramolecular nucleophilic cyclization (elimination of &#8208;SO2CF3)/elimination of fluoride.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Rich Diruthenium Complexes with &#960;&#8208;Extended Alkenyl Ligands and Their F4TCNQ Charge&#8208;Transfer Salts**
</title>

The synthesis of charge&#8208;transfer salts from diruthenium complexes with two differently extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated ligands and the strong electron&#8208;acceptor F4TCNQ is presented. These salts have been characterized by EPR, UV/Vis/NIR (in solution and solid states) and IR spectroscopy.







Abstract
The synthesis of dinuclear ruthenium alkenyl complexes with {Ru(CO)(PiPr3)2(L)} entities (L=Cl&#8722; in complexes Ru2&#8208;3 and Ru2&#8208;7; L=acetylacetonate (acac&#8722;) in complexes Ru2&#8208;4 and Ru2&#8208;8) and with &#960;&#8208;conjugated 2,7&#8208;divinylphenanthrenediyl (Ru2&#8208;3, Ru2&#8208;4) or 5,8&#8208;divinylquinoxalinediyl (Ru2&#8208;7, Ru2&#8208;8) as bridging ligands are reported. The bridging ligands are laterally &#960;&#8208;extended by anellating a pyrene (Ru2&#8208;7, Ru2&#8208;8) or a 6,7&#8208;benzoquinoxaline (Ru2&#8208;3, Ru2&#8208;4) &#960;&#8208;perimeter. This was done with the hope that the open &#960;&#8208;faces of the electron&#8208;rich complexes will foster association with planar electron acceptors via &#960;&#8208;stacking. The dinuclear complexes were subjected to cyclic and square&#8208;wave voltammetry and were characterized in all accessible redox states by IR, UV/Vis/NIR and, where applicable, by EPR spectroscopy. These studies signified the one&#8208;electron oxidized forms of divinylphenylene&#8208;bridged complexes Ru2&#8208;7, Ru2&#8208;8 as intrinsically delocalized mixed&#8208;valent species, and those of complexes Ru2&#8208;3 and Ru2&#8208;4 with the longer divinylphenanthrenediyl linker as partially localized on the IR, yet delocalized on the EPR timescale. The more electron&#8208;rich acac&#8722; congeners formed non&#8208;conductive 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 charge&#8208;transfer (CT) salts on treatment with the F4TCNQ electron acceptor. All spectroscopic techniques confirmed the presence of pairs of complex radical cations and F4TCNQ.&#8722; radical anions in these CT salts, but produced no firm evidence for the relevance of &#960;&#8208;stacking to their formation and properties.

         <title>Distinct Bimetallic Cooperativity Among Water Reduction Catalysts Containing [CoIIICoIII], [NiIINiII], and [ZnIIZnII] Cores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 23, April 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binuclear species containing [Co2], [Ni2], and [Zn2] cores had their catalytic water reduction activity studied aiming to establish possible cooperative effects among neighboring metal centers. The [Co2] and [Ni2] species effectively produce H2 via substantially different mechanisms. Structural cooperativity is observed for the former, while no obvious cooperativity is seen for the latter. The [Zn2] species is expectedly not catalytic and serves to establish the need of redox metals to attain catalysis







Abstract
Three binuclear species [LCoIII2(&#956;&#8208;Pz)2](ClO4)3 (1), [LNiII2(CH3OH)2Cl2]ClO4 (2), and [LZnII2Cl2]PF6 (3) supported by the deprotonated form of the ligand 2,6&#8208;bis[bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl) amino&#8208;methyl]&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenol were synthesized, structurally characterized as solids and in solution, and had their electrochemical and spectroscopic behavior established. Species 1&#8211;3 had their water reduction ability studied aiming to interrogate the possible cooperative catalytic activity between two neighboring metal centers. Species 1 and 2 reduced H2O to H2 effectively at an applied potential of &#8722;1.6&#8197;VAg/AgCl, yielding turnover numbers of 2,820 and 2,290, respectively, after 30&#8197;minutes. Species 3 lacked activity and was used as a negative control to eliminate the possibility of ligand&#8208;based catalysis. Pre&#8208; and post&#8208;catalytic data gave evidence of the molecular nature of the process within the timeframe of the experiments. Species 1 showed structural, rather than electronic cooperativity, while species 2 displayed no obvious cooperativity. DFT methods complemented the experimental results determining plausible mechanisms.

         <title>Encapsulation of Trimethine Cyanine in Cucurbit[8]uril: Solution versus Solid&#8208;State Inclusion Behavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 23, April 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The different outcome of the dye Cy3 inclusion in CB[8] cavity in the solid state and in water has been elucidated via crystal structure determination and NMR, ITC and fluorescence titrations respectively. The initial 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex formed in water evolves spontaneously toward an insoluble linear polymeric structure.







Abstract
Inclusion of polymethine cyanine dyes in the cavity of macrocyclic receptors is an effective strategy to alter their absorption and emission behavior in aqueous solution. In this paper, the effect of the host&#8208;guest interaction between cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) and a model trimethine indocyanine (Cy3) on dye spectral properties and aggregation in water is investigated. Solution studies, performed by a combination of spectroscopic and calorimetric techniques, indicate that the addition of CB[8] disrupts Cy3 aggregates, leading to the formation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8208;guest complex with an association constant of 1.5&#215;106&#8197;M&#8722;1. At concentrations suitable for NMR experiments, the slow formation of a supramolecular polymer was observed, followed by precipitation. Single crystals X&#8208;ray structure elucidation confirmed the formation of a polymer with 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry in the solid state.

Reviews are more important today than ever. With the glut of new publications, it has become increasing difficult to read all original papers in detail. So, scientists usually first get an overview from reviews. In the review on &#8220;Cyanine Dyes Containing Quinoline Moieties: History, Synthesis, Optical Properties and Applications&#8221; (Chem Eur. J. 2021, 27, 2430), some aspects were incorrectly described and discussed. This correspondence tries to clarify some basics that have been presented insufficiently in the review.







Abstract
In the review on &#8220;Cyanine Dyes Containing Quinoline Moieties: History, Synthesis, Optical Properties and Applications&#8221; (K. Ilina, M. Henary, Chem Eur. J. 2021, 27, 2430; https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202003697), some essential aspects were incorrectly described and discussed. To avoid further confusion, this correspondence tries to clarify both the structures and the history of some cyanine and apocyanine dyes that were not presented sufficiently.

Tunneling driven dynamics for the PD3 group of the octyl phosphonium cation in an ionic liquid has been observed by means of solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. Deuteron line&#8208;shape analysis and relaxation time measurements provide information about the structure, mobility and rearrangements of the cations in the solid, supercooled and liquid states. Hydrogen bonds of different strengths allow the change in molecular ordering upon phase transformation to be mapped. More information can be found in the Research Article by D.&#8197;I. Kolokolov, R. Ludwig et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200257). The illustrations of the tunnel are used with the kind support of NOCH GmbH &amp; Co. KG, who owns the copyright.

Mopping up radioactive iodine: A cationic MOF with the abundant metal aluminium shows chemisorption of iodine from a gas atmosphere at room temperature that is suitable for the capture of the radioisotopes 129I and 131I. The capture is explicitly stable as triiodide ions are formed with iodide inside the MOF pores. High uptake of up to one equivalent of I2 per aluminium centre marks the material out as highly suitable for applications in capturing radioactive isotopes, for example, from toxic nuclear waste as required after an unwanted hazardous exposure to the environment. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. M&#252;ller&#8208;Buschbaum et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104171).

The cover feature picture shows the successive expansion of a quinoid imidazolylidene&#8208;substituted central sulfur&#8208;containing heterocyclic core, which is accompanied by a continuous decrease in the HOMO/LUMO gap. This ultimately results in bench&#8208;stable, open&#8208;shell diradicals, as evidenced by the small singlet&#8208;triplet gap. More information can be found in the Research Article by J. Paradies et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200478).

The strategy of prelithiation is an effective pathway to supply Li source for compensating the lithium loss in the first cycle, thus promoting the energy density of batteries. This review outlines the chemical and electrochemical prelithiation methods for anodes and cathodes, with particularly discussion on the complexity of different prelithiation reagents/strategies and corresponding lithiation degree reached.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely employed in energy&#8208;storage applications owing to the relatively higher energy density and longer cycling life. However, they still need further improvement especially on the energy density to satisfy the increasing demands on the market. In this respect, the irreversible capacity loss (ICL) in the initial cycle is a critical challenge due to the lithium loss during the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the anode surface. The strategy of prelithiation was then proposed to compensate for the ICL in the anode and recover the energy density. Here, various methods of the prelithiation are summarized and classified according to the basic working mechanism. Further, considering the critical importance and promising progress of prelithiation in both fundamental research and real applications, this Review article is intended to discuss the considerations involved in the selection of prelithiation reagents/strategies and the electrochemical performance in full&#8208;cells. Moreover, insights are provided regarding the practical application prospects and the challenges that still need to be addressed.

         <title>Cross&#8208;talk Between (Hydrogen)Sulfite and Metalloproteins: Impact on Human Health</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 23, April 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic effect of sulfite and metalloproteins is a significant correlation with human health. The role and fate of sulfite is discussed in different perspectives &#8208; as a toxic substance, its biochemical transformation by two key enzymes, sulfite oxidase (sulfite&#8208;to&#8208;sulfate) and sulfite reductase (sulfite&#8208;to&#8208;sulfide), formation of sulfite radical by heme proteins (peroxidases) and neutralization of toxic sulfite radicals by globins.







Abstract
Sulfite is a potent toxic substance causing harm to multi&#8208;organ in human. Despite toxicity, it is widely used as preservative, anti&#8208;browning and anti&#8208;oxidant in foods, beverages, and pharmaceuticals, which cause easy admission of sulfite in human. Sulfite is also produced endogenously during the catabolism of cysteine and methionine. In vivo, the serum sulfite level at physiological range is strictly maintained by a molybdenum dependent sulfite oxidase (SO), which catalyzes sulfite to sulfate oxidation via a two&#8208;electron oxidation pathway. The loss of SO activity causes high serum sulfite level that fosters several diseases, including asthma, neurological dysfunction, birth defects, and heart diseases. The cytotoxicity of (bi)sulfite is implicated as sulfite radicals, which are generated by mainly heme&#8208;peroxidases via a one&#8208;electron oxidation pathway. On the other hand, the toxic sulfite radicals are neutralized to sulfite by heme&#8208;globins. The enzymatic reduction of sulfite to sulfide is catalyzed by sulfite reductase, which contains an unusual metal cofactor, siroheme&#8208;[4Fe4S]&#8208;cluster. Overall, the interaction of sulfite with various metalloproteins in&#8197;vivo is a close relation with human health. Therefore, this review describes the metabolic conversion of (bi)sulfite to sulfate, sulfite radical or sulfide via oxidation or reduction pathways by various metalloproteins (specially SOs, peroxidases, heme&#8208;globins, and sulfite reductases), and the potential applications of sulfite in biosensors/biofuel cells, anti&#8208;browning, and advance oxidation process.

     alt="Cross-talk Between (Hydrogen)Sulfite and Metalloproteins: Impact on Human Health"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Synergistic effect of&lt;/b&gt; sulfite and metalloproteins is a significant correlation with human health. The role and fate of sulfite is discussed in different perspectives - as a toxic substance, its biochemical transformation by two key enzymes, sulfite oxidase (sulfite-to-sulfate) and sulfite reductase (sulfite-to-sulfide), formation of sulfite radical by heme proteins (peroxidases) and neutralization of toxic sulfite radicals by globins.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sulfite is a potent toxic substance causing harm to multi-organ in human. Despite toxicity, it is widely used as preservative, anti-browning and anti-oxidant in foods, beverages, and pharmaceuticals, which cause easy admission of sulfite in human. Sulfite is also produced endogenously during the catabolism of cysteine and methionine. In vivo, the serum sulfite level at physiological range is strictly maintained by a molybdenum dependent sulfite oxidase (SO), which catalyzes sulfite to sulfate oxidation via a two-electron oxidation pathway. The loss of SO activity causes high serum sulfite level that fosters several diseases, including asthma, neurological dysfunction, birth defects, and heart diseases. The cytotoxicity of (bi)sulfite is implicated as sulfite radicals, which are generated by mainly heme-peroxidases via a one-electron oxidation pathway. On the other hand, the toxic sulfite radicals are neutralized to sulfite by heme-globins. The enzymatic reduction of sulfite to sulfide is catalyzed by sulfite reductase, which contains an unusual metal cofactor, siroheme-[4Fe4S]-cluster. Overall, the interaction of sulfite with various metalloproteins in&#8197;vivo is a close relation with human health. Therefore, this review describes the metabolic conversion of (bi)sulfite to sulfate, sulfite radical or sulfide via oxidation or reduction pathways by various metalloproteins (specially SOs, peroxidases, heme-globins, and sulfite reductases), and the potential applications of sulfite in biosensors/biofuel cells, anti-browning, and advance oxidation process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deposition of Vertically Aligned Ag/Ag2S Nanoflakes on EGaIn Particles for Humidity Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core&#8211;shell EGaIn/Ag particles were prepared in an ultrasonication assisted galvanic replacement reaction, and were subsequently transformed into EGaIn/Ag/Ag2S by a partial sulfurization. A humidity sensor based on the EGaIn/Ag/Ag2S particles showed superior sensing response to EGaIn and EGaIn/Ag due to the silver sulfide in the composites; two conduction mechanisms take place simultaneously.







Abstract
Liquid metals, which possess both good electrical conductivity and liquid&#8208;like processability, have drawn much attention recently. They are also capable of acting as synthesis templates to guide the deposition of other functional materials. Herein, through an in&#8208;situ galvanic replacement reaction assisted by ultrasonication, core&#8211;shell EGaIn/Ag particles composed of EGaIn cores and vertically aligned Ag nanoflakes as shells were prepared; they were further sulfurized to yield ternary EGaIn/Ag/Ag2S core&#8211;shell composite particles. A humidity sensor based on EGaIn/Ag/Ag2S particles showed much higher sensing response than EGaIn and EGaIn/Ag. Such superior performance could be attributed to the n&#8208;type semiconducting character of Ag2S allowing it to receive electrons from water molecules at low humidity, and its highly hydrophilic surface allowing it to absorb more water molecules at higher humidity so as to enable the formation of ion&#8208;conductive paths.

         <title>pH&#8208;Triggered Removal of Nitrogenous Organic Micropollutants from Water by Using Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra</title>

MOPping up micropollutants: A new pH&#8208;triggered pollutant&#8208;removal methodology that uses water&#8208;soluble metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs) as coordinative capturing agents removes nitrogenous organic micropollutants from water. The exohedral coordination positions in the MOP structure are harnessed to coordinatively sequester the coordinating pollutants, while the exposed surface carboxyl groups are used to control their solubility in water through acid/base reactions. Benzotriazole (BT), benzothiazole (BTZ), 1&#8208;napthylamine (NA) and isoquinoline (IQ) were selected to validate this methodology.







Abstract
Water pollution threatens human and environmental health worldwide. Thus, there is a pressing need for new approaches to water purification. Herein, we report a novel supramolecular strategy based on the use of a metal&#8208;organic polyhedron (MOP) as a capture agent to remove nitrogenous organic micropollutants from water, even at very low concentrations (ppm), based exclusively on coordination chemistry at the external surface of the MOP. Specifically, we exploit the exohedral coordination positions of RhII&#8208;MOP to coordinatively sequester pollutants bearing N&#8208;donor atoms in aqueous solution, and then harness their exposed surface carboxyl groups to control their aqueous solubility through acid/base reactions. We validated this approach for removal of benzotriazole, benzothiazole, isoquinoline, and 1&#8208;napthylamine from water.

         <title>Hierarchical Fibrous Honeycomb Ceramics with High Load Capability and Low Light&#8208;Off Temperature for the Next&#8208;Generation Auto Emissions Standards</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new 3D microarchitecture as a backbone to support the catalyst was prepared by combing with the synergy of high&#8208;strength ceramic fibers and ultrathin TiO2 nanosheets. The honeycomb ceramic exhibits a high volume&#8208;specific surface area of 3.59&#215;104&#8197;cm2/cm3, a compressive strength of 2.01&#8197;MPa. It also delivered a low light&#8208;off temperature of 150&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Novel and stringent automotive exhaust gas emissions standards are urgently needed to counter the problems posed by the worsening global climate and environment. However, the traditional cordierite&#8208;based honeycomb ceramics substrates with ultimate pore density have seriously restricted the establishment of new emission standards. Herein, we introduce a novel robust substrate with tailored volume&#8208;specific surface area and low heat capacity. This substrate employs the synergy of high&#8208;strength ceramic fibers and ultrathin TiO2 nanosheets. The micro&#8208;sized fibers provide support to ensure structural strength during the catalytic reaction, while the nanosheets play the dual role of connecting the fibers and providing a high surface area for catalyst immobilization. The new three&#8208;dimensional (3D) microarchitecture exhibits a high volume&#8208;specific surface area of 3.59&#215;104&#8197;cm2/cm3, a compressive strength of 2.01&#8197;MPa, and remarkable stability after high&#8208;speed air erosion at 800&#8201;&#176;C. The honeycomb&#8208;like structure exhibit low resistance to gas flow. Furthermore, after loading with Pt and Pd nanoparticles, the composite 3D microarchitecture delivered an excellent catalytic performance and prominent structural stability, with a super low light&#8208;off temperature of 150&#8201;&#176;C. The outstanding mechanical and thermal stability and the high surface area and light&#8208;off temperature of the new substrate indicate its potential for use as a highly efficient catalytic carrier to meet the next&#8208;generation auto emissions standards.

         <title>Reversible and stepwise single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation of a platinum(II) complex with vapochromic luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The vapochromic single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation of a highly luminescent Pt(II) complex bearing an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene [Pt(CN)  2  (  t  Bu&#8208;impy)] (  t  Bu&#8208;impyH  +  = 1&#8208;  t  &#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1  H  &#8208;imidazolium) was reported. The trihydrate form of the complex, that exhibits blue  3  MMLCT emission owing to weak Pt&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt interactions, changed its luminescence color from blue to yellowish&#8208;green upon the desorption of water molecules keeping the high emission quantum yield more than 0.6. Variable&#8208;temperature and continuous in&#8208;situ tracking of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements revealed that the SCSC transformation proceeds reversibly by the release and reabsorption of water molecules changing the stacked structure slightly. As a result, the dynamics of vapor&#8208;induced SCSC transformation were elucidated that the anhydrous form returned to the original trihydrate form in a two&#8208;step process under a water vapor atmosphere. In addition, the Pt(II) complex exhibited a similar SCSC response accompanied by a luminescence color change in the presence of methanol vapor, while being inactive toward ethanol vapor.</dc:description>

         <title>A Mesoionic Diselenolene Anion and the Corresponding Radical Dianion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Being mesoionic makes the difference: A diselenolene ligand with fundamentally different electronic properties compared to a normal diselenolene is reported. Two stable redox states are accessible: a paramagnetic radical dianion and a diamagnetic monoanion. The ligand was used for the preparation of novel aluminum bis&#8208; and tris(diselenolene) complexes.







Abstract
Dichalcogenolenes are archetypal redox non&#8208;innocent ligands with numerous applications. Herein, a diselenolene ligand with fundamentally different electronic properties is described. A mesoionic diselenolene was prepared by selenation of a C2&#8208;protected imidazolium salt. This ligand is diamagnetic, which is in contrast to the paramagnetic nature of standard dichalcogenolene monoanions. The new ligand is also redox&#8208;active, as demonstrated by isolation of a stable diselenolene radical dianion. The unique electronic properties of the new ligand give rise to unusual coordination chemistry. Thus, preparation of a hexacoordinate aluminum tris(diselenolene) complex and a Lewis acidic aluminate complex with two ligand&#8208;centered unpaired electrons was achieved.

         <title>1,2&#8208;Carboboration of Arylallenes by In Situ Generated Alkenylboranes for the Synthesis of 1,4&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemo&#8208; and regioselective 1,2&#8208;carboboration of arylallenes by alkenylboranes, formed in&#8197;situ by hydroboration of alkynes with Piers&#8217; borane (HB(C6F5)2) is reported. This novel 1,2&#8208;carboboration and a subsequent Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling were used for the synthesis of twenty new aryl substituted 1,4&#8208;dienes.







Abstract
We herein report a novel method for the coupling of unactivated alkynes and arylallenes, which relies on an unprecedented and regioselective 1,2&#8208;carboboration of the allene by an alkenylborane. The alkenylborane is conveniently prepared in&#8197;situ by hydroboration of an alkyne with Piers&#8217; borane, i.&#8201;e., HB(C6F5)2. The boryl&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208;dienes that are formed by this carboboration are well&#8208;suited for a subsequent Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling with aryl iodides. This allowed us to develop a three&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot protocol for the synthesis of aryl&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208;dienes. The generality of the reaction was demonstrated by the synthesis of twenty dienes with modular variations of all three reaction partners. The mechanism of the new 1,2&#8208;carboboration was investigated using dispersion corrected double&#8208;hybrid DFT computations that allowed us to rationalize the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of this key step.

         <title>Constructing Atomic Fe and N Co&#8208;doped Hollow Carbon Nanospheres with a Polymer Encapsulation Strategy for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries with Accelerated Polysulfide Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer encapsulation strategy is designed to synthesize atomic Fe and N co&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanospheres (Fe&#8722;NHC) with Fe&#8722;Nx sites for modifying commercial PP separator of LSBs to suppress the shuttle effect and promote the sluggish kinetics of intermediate polysulfides. Therefore, the battery with the Fe&#8722;NHC/PP separator delivers outstanding cycling and rate performances. Even at a harsh current density of 4&#8197;C, a high capacity of 824&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 is achieved, indicating the superiority of the Fe&#8208;NHC/PP separator in LSBs.







Abstract
As competitive next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries, lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) suffer from the shuttle effect and the sluggish kinetics of intermediate polysulfides during charge and discharge processes, adversely affecting their electrochemical performances and actual applications. Herein, we demonstrate a polymer encapsulation strategy to synthesize atomic Fe and N co&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanospheres (Fe&#8722;NHC) with Fe&#8722;Nx sites for modifying commercial PP separator of LSBs to suppress the shuttle effect and promote the kinetics of intermediate polysulfides. Benefiting from the excellent structural design, the doped&#8208;N with positive charges could effectively adsorb negatively charged soluble polysulfides, help attract the soluble polysulfides to the Fe atoms and boost the catalytic transformation of the soluble polysulfides. Additionally, such a thin carbon shell could provide a short mass diffusion pathway and hence promote the adsorption and the catalytic conversion. Therefore, the battery with the Fe&#8722;NHC/PP separator delivers outstanding cycling and rate performances. At the large current density of 1&#8197;C, the specific capacity is 1079&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 and maintains a low loss of 0.076&#8201;% per cycle within 500&#8197;cycles. Even at a harsh current density of 4&#8197;C, a high capacity of 824&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 is still achieved, indicating the advantage of the Fe&#8722;NHC/PP separator in LSBs.

         <title>Halogenation of the Hexaphosphabenzene Complex [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;P6)]: Snapshots on the Reaction Progress</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Snapshots on the halogenation of the hexaphosphabenzene complex [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;P6)] show the plethora of complexes that are formed, resulting from the initial halogenation of the P6 ligand. Among them, with iodine, a compound with six P atoms still present could be obtained, directly at room temperature. With the more aggressive bromine and chlorine, the P6 unit degrades to an allylic P3 unit but phosphorus rich compounds could also be isolated.







Abstract

The reaction of 1 with the far stronger oxidizing agent PCl5 was followed via time&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy.

All complexes were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy and their electronic structures were elucidated by DFT calculations.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Snapshots on the halogenation&lt;/b&gt; of the hexaphosphabenzene complex [(Cp*Mo)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;,&#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;:&#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-P&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)] show the plethora of complexes that are formed, resulting from the initial halogenation of the P&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; ligand. Among them, with iodine, a compound with six P atoms still present could be obtained, directly at room temperature. With the more aggressive bromine and chlorine, the P&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; unit degrades to an allylic P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; unit but phosphorus rich compounds could also be isolated.

         <dc:description>
Development of efficient plasmonic nanocatalysts with high catalytic performance and efficient light harvesting properties is of vital importance. Herein, the authors rationally designed and synthesized a plasmonic nanocatalyst composed of Au&#8208;framed Pd nanocubes by an Ag(I)&#8208;assisted seed&#8208;mediated growth method. The unique Au&#8208;framed Pd nanocubes can integrate the superior electrocatalytic of Pd and the outstanding plasmonic properties of Au. Thus, these nanostructures were employed as plasmonic nanocatalysts for plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol with improved stability.







Abstract
Surface plasmon of coinage metal nanostructures has been employed as a powerful route in boosting the performances in heterogenous catalysis. Development of efficient plasmonic nanocatalysts with high catalytic performance and efficient light harvesting properties is of vital importance. Herein, we rationally designed and synthesized a plasmonic nanocatalyst composed of Au&#8208;framed Pd nanocubes by an Ag(I)&#8208;assisted seed&#8208;mediated growth method. In the synthesis, the incorporation of Ag(I) suppresses the reduction of Au on the {100} surface of cubic Pd seeds and leads to the formation of Au nanoframes on the Pd nanocubes. The unique Au&#8208;framed Pd nanocubes can integrate the superior electrocatalytic of Pd and the outstanding plasmonic properties of Au. Thus, these nanostructures were employed as plasmonic nanocatalysts for plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol with improved stability.

         <title>Reactions of a Four&#8208;Membered Borete with Carbon, Silicon, and Gallium Donor Ligands: Fused and Spiro&#8208;Type Boracycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A four&#8208;membered naphthalene&#8208;supported borete is investigated as a masked 1,4&#8208;dipolar donor&#8208;acceptor cyclobutane. Ring expansion reactions confirm such type of reactivity and afford complex cyclic structures including fused and spiro&#8208;type polycyclics.







Abstract
Donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes or cyclobutanes are dipolar reagents, which are widely used in the synthesis of complex organic (hetero)cycles in ring expansion reactions. Applying this concept to boron containing heterocycles, the four&#8208;membered borete cyclo&#8208;iPr2N&#8208;BC10H6 reacted with the carbon donor ligands 2,6&#8208;xylylisonitrile and the carbene IMes :C(NMesCH)2 with ring expansion and ring fusion, respectively. In particular, the tetracyclic structure formed with IMes displays zwitterionic character and absorption in the visible region. In contrast to the carbene IMes, the heavier carbenoids :Si(NDippCH)2 and :Ga(AmIm) with a two&#8208;coordinate donor atom afford spiro&#8208;type bicyclic compounds, which display four&#8208;coordinate geometry at silicon or gallium. (TD&#8208;)DFT calculations provide deeper insight into the mechanism of formation and the absorption properties of these new compounds.

         <title>Renaissance of Topotactic Ion&#8208;Exchange for Functional Solids with Close Packed Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topotactic cation exchange on close&#8208;packed structures has recently emerged as a potent synthetic tactic for the preparation of many new functional solids. A synergistic blending of new functionality to an underlying three&#8208;dimensional structure can be achieved that, in many cases, yields a unique pathway to metastable solids with new and/or enhanced properties, such as for visible&#8208;light photocatalysts. For example, shown is the new semiconductor photocatalyst SZT (SnZr1/2Ti1/2O3) as a nano&#8208;shell on BZT (BaZr1/2Ti1/2O3).







Abstract
Recently, many new, complex, functional oxides have been discovered with the surprising use of topotactic ion&#8208;exchange reactions on close&#8208;packed structures, such as found for wurtzite, rutile, perovskite, and other structure types. Despite a lack of apparent cation&#8208;diffusion pathways in these structure types, synthetic low&#8208;temperature transformations are possible with the interdiffusion and exchange of functional cations possessing ns2 stereoactive lone pairs (e.&#8201;g., Sn(II)) or unpaired ndx electrons (e.&#8201;g., Co(II)), targeting new and favorable modulations of their electronic, magnetic, or catalytic properties. This enables a synergistic blending of new functionality to an underlying three&#8208;dimensional connectivity, i.&#8201;e., [&#8208;M&#8722;O&#8208;M&#8208;O&#8208;]n, that is maintained during the transformation. In many cases, this tactic represents the only known pathway to prepare thermodynamically unstable solids that otherwise would commonly decompose by phase segregation, such as that recently applied to the discovery of many new small bandgap semiconductors.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Topotactic cation exchange&lt;/b&gt; on close-packed structures has recently emerged as a potent synthetic tactic for the preparation of many new functional solids. A synergistic blending of new functionality to an underlying three-dimensional structure can be achieved that, in many cases, yields a unique pathway to metastable solids with new and/or enhanced properties, such as for visible-light photocatalysts. For example, shown is the new semiconductor photocatalyst SZT (SnZr&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) as a nano-shell on BZT (BaZr&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; electrons (e.&#8201;g., Co(II)), targeting new and favorable modulations of their electronic, magnetic, or catalytic properties. This enables a synergistic blending of new functionality to an underlying three-dimensional connectivity, i.&#8201;e., [-M&#8722;O-M-O-]&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;, that is maintained during the transformation. In many cases, this tactic represents the only known pathway to prepare thermodynamically unstable solids that otherwise would commonly decompose by phase segregation, such as that recently applied to the discovery of many new small bandgap semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of An Aluminosilicate POS Zeolite with Intersecting 12&#215;11&#215;11&#8208;Member&#8208;Ring Pore Channels by Using a Designed Organic Structure&#8208;Directing Agent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Large and extra&#8208;large pore zeolites have been widely applied in industrial areas as catalysts, adsorbents, etc. Among them, silica and/or aluminosilicate zeolites have been attracted great attention due to their excellent hydrothermal stability and strong acidity. However, a great deal of zeolite structures are still not available in the form of silica and/or aluminosilicate. Herein, we report the synthesis of pure silica and aluminosilicate large&#8208;pore zeolites, denoted as NUD&#8208;14 and Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;14, respectively, by using a designed cation 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;4&#8208;phenylpyridinium as an organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA). NUD&#8208;14 has an intersecting 12&#215;11&#215;11&#8208;member ring pore system, which is isostructural to the germanosilicate PUK&#8208;16 zeolite with a POS topology. The OSDAs can be completely removed from the framework by calcination. NUD&#8208;14 and Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;14 possess excellent acid and hydrothermal stabilities, superior to the germanosilicate POS zeolite. The incorporation of Al into the zeolite framework makes the Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;14 zeolite possess medium and strong acidities. The successful synthesis of NUD&#8208;14 consisting of a rare odd&#8208;membered ring pore structure may provide a platform for interesting size&#8208; and shape&#8208;selective catalytic applications.</dc:description>

This addition reaction, which represents a new easy approach to asymmetrically substituted  cyclo  &#8208;1,3&#8208;diphospha&#8208;2,4&#8208;diazanes, was investigated mechanistically by different spectroscopic methods (NMR, EPR, IR, Raman) as well as X&#8208;ray diffraction, suggesting a stepwise radical reaction mechanism, as evidenced by the  in&#8208;situ  detection of the phosphorus&#8208;centered monoradical [  &#8226;  P(  &#956;  &#8208;NTer)  2  P&#8208;R].

Comparison of the EPR spectrum of the radical intermediate in the addition reaction with that of the synthesized new [  &#8226;  P(  &#956;  &#8208;NTer)  2  P&#8208;Et] radical clearly proves the existen&#173;ce of radicals in the course of the reaction of biradical [  &#8226;  P(  &#956;  &#8208;NTer)  2  P  &#8226;  ] (  1  ) with bromoethane.

         <title>Measurements and Utilization of Consistent Gibbs Energies of Transfer of Single Ions: Towards a Unified Redox Potential Scale for All Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing the &#8220;ideal&#8221; ionic liquid salt bridge for measurements of Gibbs energies of transfer of silver ions between the solvents water, acetonitrile, propylene carbonate and dimethylformamide results in a consistent data set with a precision of 0.6 kJ mol  &#8722;1  over 87 measurements in 10 half&#8208;cells. This forms the basis for a coherent experimental thermodynamic framework of ion solvation chemistry. In addition, we define the solvent independent pe  abs  H2O  &#8208; and the  E  abs  H2O  &#8208;values that account for the electronating potential of any redox system similar to the pH  abs  H2O  &#8208;value of a medium that accounts for its protonating potential. This  E  abs  H2O  &#8208;scale is thermodynamically well&#8208;defined enabling the straightforward comparability of the redox potentials (reducities) of all media with respect to the aqueous redox potential scale, hence unifying all conventional solvent&#180;s redox potential scales. Thus, using the herein published Gibbs energy of transfer of the silver ion one can convert and unify all hitherto published redox potentials measured for example against ferrocene to the  E  abs  H2O  &#8208;scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Irreversible Inhibition of IspG, a Target for the Development of New Antimicrobials, by a 2&#8208;Vinyl Analogue of its MEcPP Substrate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A substrate analogue of MEcPP, a key intermediate in the MEP pathway, has been synthesized. The target compound features a vinyl functionality in place of the natural methyl substituent. Potent irreversible inhibition towards GcpE (IspG) was observed. Introduction of a double bond allows conjugation in the putative reactive intermediates while entering enzymatic transformation. Unexpected covalent trapping could happen as consequential damage.







Abstract
IspG (also called GcpE) is an oxygen&#8208;sensitive [4Fe&#8208;4S] enzyme catalyzing the penultimate step of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, a validated target for drug development. It converts 2&#8208;C&#8208;methyl&#8208;d&#8208;erythritol&#8208;2,4&#8208;cyclo&#8208;diphosphate (MEcPP) into (E)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;but&#8208;2&#8208;enyl&#8208;1&#8208;diphosphate (HMBPP). The reaction, assimilated to a reductive dehydration, involves redox partners responsible for the formal transfer of two electrons to substrate MEcPP. The 2&#8208;vinyl analogue of MEcPP was designed to generate conjugated species during enzyme catalysis, with the aim of providing new reactive centers to be covalently trapped by neighboring amino acid residues. The synthesized substrate analogue displayed irreversible inhibition towards IspG. Furthermore, we have shown that electron transfer occurs prior to inhibition; this might designate conjugated intermediates as probable affinity tags through covalent interaction at the catalytic site. This is the first report of an irreversible inhibitor of the IspG metalloenzyme.

         <title>&#947;&#8208;Resorcyclic Acid&#8208;Based AIEgens for Illuminating Endoplasmic Reticulum**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Illuminate ER: Two small molecules with &#947;&#8208;resorcyclic acid moiety were designed and synthesized having aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) activity due to dual intramolecular H&#8208;bonding. These small molecules localized into the sub&#8208;cellular endoplasmic reticulum to light it up.







Abstract
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has emerged as one of the interesting sub&#8208;cellular organelles due to its role in myriads of biological phenomena. Subsequently, visualization of the structure&#8208;function and dynamics of ER remained a major challenge to understand its involvement in different diseased states including cancer. To illuminate the ER, herein we have designed and synthesized &#947;&#8208;resorcyclic acid&#8208;based small molecules, which showed remarkable aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property in water. This AIE property was originated from the dual intramolecular H&#8208;bonding leading to the self&#8208;assembled 2D aggregation confirmed by pH&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent fluorescence quenching studies as well as scanning electron microscopy. These small molecules illuminated the sub&#8208;cellular ER in HeLa cervical cancer cells as well as non&#8208;cancerous RPE&#8208;1 human retinal epithelial cells within 1&#8197;h. These novel small molecules have the potential to light up ER chemical biology in diseased states.

         <title>Exploring the Biosynthetic Potential of TsrM, a B12&#8208;dependent Radical SAM Methyltransferase Catalyzing Non&#8208;radical Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TsrM is a B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzyme catalyzing methylation reactions from carbon&#8208;atoms to nucleophilic atoms making it a unique and versatile alkylating agent. TsrM is able to directly transfer methyl groups on the less reactive carbon atom of the indole ring and to install several methyl groups on its substrate. TsrM has thus unique properties among radical SAM enzymes by notably catalyzing non&#8208;radical reactions. (SAM: S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine).







Abstract
B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzymes are an emerging enzyme family with approximately 200,000 proteins. These enzymes have been shown to catalyze chemically challenging reactions such as methyl transfer to sp2&#8208; and sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms. However, to date we have little information regarding their complex mechanisms and their biosynthetic potential. Here we show, using X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, mutagenesis and synthetic probes that the vitamin B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzyme TsrM catalyzes not only C&#8208; but also N&#8208;methyl transfer reactions further expanding its synthetic versatility. We also demonstrate that TsrM has the unique ability to directly transfer a methyl group to the benzyl core of tryptophan, including the least reactive position C4. Collectively, our study supports that TsrM catalyzes non&#8208;radical reactions and establishes the usefulness of radical SAM enzymes for novel biosynthetic schemes including serial alkylation reactions at particularly inert C&#8722;H bonds.

         <title>Several Key Factors for Efficient Electrocatalytic Water Splitting: Active Site Coordination Environment, Morphology Changes and Intermediates Identification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;splitting has emerged as a promising alternative strategy to produce clean hydrogen fuel. However, current electrocatalytic water splitting suffers from sluggish kinetics, thus developing efficient electrocatalysts is crucial. Identifying reaction centers discloses the reaction mechanism and will undoubtedly facilitate the design and optimization of efficient water splitting electrocatalysts. This review summarizes several advances involving the identification of the actual active sites and intermediates capture on the catalytic surface. The morphology and valence states change on 2D materials are chose to illustrate how structural evolution affect catalytic activity. Specifically, in situ/ex situ electron microscopy techniques that used for the characterization of catalytic sites, and spectroscopy techniques that used to detect active intermediates at the molecular level are highlighted. In addition, several perspectives, such as the development of new in&#8208;situ techniques and electrokinetic analysis methods, are emphasized to shed light on future research.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoactivatable V&#8208;Shaped Bifunctional Quinone Methide Precursors as a New Class of Selective G&#8208;quadruplex Alkylating Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combining the selectivity of G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) ligands with the spatial and temporal control of photochemistry is an emerging strategy to elucidate the biological relevance of these structures. In this work, we developed six novel V&#8208;shaped G4 ligands that can, upon irradiation, form stable covalent adducts with G4 structures via the reactive intermediate, quinone methide (QM). We thoroughly investigated the photochemical properties of the ligands and their ability to generate QMs. Subsequently, we analysed their specificity for various topologies of G4 and discovered a preferential binding towards the human telomeric sequence. Finally, we tested the ligand ability to act as photochemical alkylating agents, identifying the covalent adducts with G4 structures. This work introduces a novel molecular tool in the chemical biology toolkit for G4s.</dc:description>

         <title>Persulfurated Benzene&#8208;Cored Asterisks with &#960;&#8208;Extended ThioNaphthyl Arms: Synthesis, Structural, Photophysical and Covalent Dynamic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of regioisomeric asterisks (  5  ) and (  6  ) incorporating a benzene core with six 1&#8208;naphthylthio or six 2&#8208;naphthylthio arms are reported in search for new materials with optoelectronic properties. The consequences on the extension of a &#960; system surrounding a persulfurated benzene core provide a new avenue to study the structural, photophysical, and chemical properties of such family of all&#8208;organic phosphors. It also diverts the persulfuration mechanism after two radical cyclizations for making a [5]dithiohelicene by&#8208;product (  7  ), and favors dynamic sulfur component exchange reactions surrounding the core. These exchanges convert asterisks (  5  ) and (  6  ), non&#8208;phosphorescent at 20&#176;C to the highly phosphorescent (  4  ) (&#981; ~ 100%, solid state at 20&#176;C). For asterisks (  5  ) and (  6  ), the absence of the typical phosphorescence of the per(phenylthio)benzene core in the solid state at 20&#176;C and the presence of a weak naphthalene&#8208;based phosphorescence at 77 K is attributed to an energy transfer from the triplet state of the persulfurated benzene core to the outer naphthalene moieties, resulting in an antenna system.</dc:description>

         <title>How Ionization Catalyzes Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have studied the catalytic effect of ionization on the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between 1,3&#8208;butadiene and acrylaldehyde using relativistic density functional theory (DFT). Removal of an electron from the dienophile, acrylaldehyde, significantly accelerates the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction and shifts the reaction mechanism from concerted asynchronous for the neutral Diels&#8208;Alder reaction to stepwise for the radical&#8208;cation Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. Our detailed activation strain and Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital analyses reveal how ionization of the dienophile enhances the Diels&#8208;Alder reactivity via two mechanisms: (i) by amplifying the asymmetry in the dienophile&#8217;s occupied p&#8208;orbitals to such an extent that the reaction goes from concerted asynchronous to stepwise and thus with substantially less steric (Pauli) repulsion per reaction step; (ii) by enhancing the stabilizing orbital interactions that result from the ability of the singly occupied molecular orbital of the radical&#8208;cation dienophile to engage in an additional three&#8208;electron bonding interaction with the highest occupied molecular orbital of the diene.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulation of triplet excited states in two&#8208;component systems for high&#8208;performance organic afterglow materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The past several years have witnessed tremendous development of novel chemical structures, new design strategies and intriguing applications in the field of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and organic afterglow materials. This review focuses on recent advancements of high&#8208;performance organic afterglow materials obtained by two&#8208;component design strategies such as dopant&#8208;matrix strategy, donor&#8208;acceptor strategy, sensitization and energy transfer strategy. Based on some cutting&#8208;edge studies, organic afterglow efficiency has been largely improved, exceeding 90% in several cases. Organic afterglow durations reach tens of seconds in phosphorescence systems and hours in donor&#8208;acceptor systems. Organic afterglow brightness outcompetes some inorganic afterglow materials at the first several seconds after ceasing excitation source. Organic afterglow colors cover the whole visible regions and extend to near&#8208;infrared regions with respectful afterglow efficiency. On the basis of these achievements, researchers demonstrate promising applications of organic afterglow materials in diverse fields, which has also been reviewed.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Pyrrole&#8208;Based Phosphaphenalene Gold Complexes: Versatile Anticancer Tools with Wide Applicability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new gold standard: Pyrrole&#8208;based phosphaphenalene gold(I) complexes are potent anticancer agents with high efficacy against 14&#8197;different brain cancer cell lines derived from glioblastomas, brain metastases, meningiomas, IDH&#8208;mutant gliomas and head and neck cancers. The IC50 values reach concentrations as low as 730&#8197;nM. Furthermore, these versatile and tunable agents exhibit favorable optoelectronic properties giving rise to potential theranostic applications.







Abstract
Brain cancer, one of the most lethal diseases, urgently requires the discovery of novel theranostic agents. In this context, molecules based on six&#8208;membered phosphorus heterocycles &#8211; phosphaphenalenes &#8211; are especially attractive; they possess unique characteristics that allow precise chemical engineering. Herein, we demonstrate that subtle structural modifications of the phosphaphenalene&#8208;based gold(I) complexes lead to modify their electronic distribution, endow them with marked photophysical properties and enhance their efficacy against cancer. In particular, phosphaphenalene&#8208;based gold(I) complexes containing a pyrrole ring show antiproliferative properties in 14&#8197;cell lines including glioblastomas, brain metastases, meningiomas, IDH&#8208;mutant gliomas and head and neck cancers, reaching IC50 values as low as 0.73&#8197;&#956;M. The bioactivity of this new family of drugs in combination with their photophysical properties thus offer new research possibilities for both the fundamental investigation and treatment of brain cancer.

         <title>Controllable zeolite AST crystallization: between the classical and reversed crystal growth</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystal growth mechanisms govern a wide range of properties of crystalline materials. Reversed crystal growth is one of the non&#8208;classical mechanisms observed in many materials. However, the reversed crystallization starting from amorphous aggregates and the key factors driving this growth remain elusive. Here, we describe a characteristic model of reversed crystal growth representing the inner structure and crystallinity development of aggregates studied by microscopy and nano X&#8208;ray computed tomography. By adjusting the synthesis conditions, the fundamental function of the structure&#8208;directing agent, which determines the crystallization pathway, was revealed. As a result, the crystal growth mode can be &amp;ldquo;switched&amp;rdquo; from the classical route at a low ratio of SDA/framework elements to reversed growth at a high ratio. Our findings provide further insights into crystal growth control, which is crucial for improving synthesis protocols and designing various forms of crystalline materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Red Light&#8208;Emitting Thermally&#8208;Activated Delayed Fluorescence of Naphthalimide&#8208;Phenoxazine Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyad: Time&#8208;Resolved Optical and Magnetic Spectroscopic Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We prepared an orthogonal compact electron&#8208;donor (phenoxazine, PXZ)&#8208;acceptor (naphthalimide, NI) dyad (  NI&#8208;PXZ  ), to study the photophysics of the thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), which has luminescence lifetime of 16.4 ns (99.2%)/17.0 &#956;s (0.80%). A weak charge transfer (CT) absorption band was observed for the dyad, indicating non&#8208;negligible electronic coupling between the donor and acceptor at ground state. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy shows a fast charge separation (CS) (  ca.  2.02 &#8764; 2.72 ps), the majority of the singlet CS state is short&#8208;lived, especially in polar solvents (  &#964;  CR  = 10.3 ps in acetonitrile,  vs  . 1.83 ns in toluene, 7.81 ns in  n  &#8208;hexane). Nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy detects a long&#8208;lived transient species in  n  &#8208;hexane, which is with a mixed triplet mixed local excited state (  3  LE) and charge separated state (  3  CS), the lifetime is 15.4 &#956;s. In polar solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran and acetonitrile, a neat  3  CS state was observed, whose lifetimes are 226 ns and 142 ns, respectively. Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra indicate the existence of strongly spin exchanged  3  LE/  3  CT states, with the effective zero field splitting (ZFS) |  D  | and |  E  | parameters of 1484 MHz and 109 MHz, respectively, much smaller than that of the native  3  NI state (2475 and 135 MHz). It's rare but solid experimental evidence that a closely&#8208;lying  3  LE state is crucial for occurrence of TADF and this  3  LE state is an essential intermediate state to facilitate reverse ISC in TADF system.</dc:description>

         <title>Indole Editing Enabled by HFIP&#8208;Mediated Ring&#8208;Switch Reactions of 3&#8208;Amino&#8208;2&#8208;Hydroxyindolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We found the novel reactivity of hemiaminal as a precursor for indole editing at the multi&#8208;site. The HFIP&#8208;promoted indole editing of indoline hemiaminals affords 2&#8208;arylindoles through a ring&#8208;switch sequence. The key to success of this transformation is to use a cyclic hemiaminal as an &#945;&#8208;amino aldehyde surrogate under transient tautomeric control. This transformation features mild reaction conditions and good yields with broad functional group tolerance. The utility of this indole editing is presented through the one&#8208;pot protocol and the synthesis of isocryptolepine.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Heterocyclic Carbon&#8208;Boron Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroaryl boronic acids and esters are extremely important and valuable intermediates because of their wide application in the synthesis of marketed drugs and bioactive compounds. Over the last couple of decades, the construction of highly important heteroaryl carbon&#8208;boron bonds has created huge attention. The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free protocols are more green, less sensitive to air and moisture, and also economically advantageous over the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based protocols. The transition metal&#8208;free C&#8208;H borylation of heteroarenes and C&#8208;X (X = halogen) borylation of heteroaryl halides represents an excellent approach for their synthesis. Also, various cyclization and alkyne activation protocols have been recently established for their synthesis. The goal of this review article is to summarize the existing literature and the current state of the art for transition metal&#8208;free synthesis of heteroaryl boronic acid and esters.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photoresponsive Receptor with a 105 Magnitude of Reversible Anion&#8208;Binding Switching</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new photoswitchable chromophore, the diiminoguanidinium group can be used as the base for an anion receptor based. Like the yin&#8208;yang (dark&#8211;light) relationship between the Moon and the Sun, the E,E and Z,Z photoisomers of the 2&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;diiminoguanidinium receptor have opposite binding behaviors towards sulfate, a representative oxyanion. The open E,E form binds sulfate with extraordinary strength in the dark, through chelating guanidinium hydrogen bonds. Upon photoisomerization to the Z,Z isomer, the anion&#8208;binding site is shut off, thereby ejecting the bound sulfate anion. More information can be found in the Research Article by B.&#8197;A. Moyer, R. Custelcean and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200719).

CAAC donates electron and acts as reductant: Cyclic(alkyl)(amino)(carbene) CAAC donates one electron during the formation of transient radical&#8208;cation evidenced by cyclic voltammetry and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Subsequently, the one electron&#8208;reductant property of the disclosed CAAC was used to synthesize acyclic(amino)(aryl)carbene&#8208;based Thiele and Chichibabin hydrocarbons. Notably, the acyclic(amino)(aryl)carbene&#8208;based Chichibabin's hydrocarbon shows an appreciable population of the triplet state at room temperature, as evidenced by both variable&#8208;temperature NMR and EPR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs) to be one&#8208;electron reductants under the formation of a transient radical cation as indicated by EPR spectroscopy. The disclosed CAAC reducing reactivity was used to synthesize acyclic(amino)(aryl)carbene&#8208;based Thiele and Chichibabin hydrocarbons, a new class of Kekul&#233; diradicaloids. The results demonstrate CAACs to be potent organic reductants. Notably, the acyclic(amino)(aryl)carbene&#8208;based Chichibabin's hydrocarbon shows an appreciable population of the triplet state at room temperature, as evidenced by both variable&#8208;temperature NMR and EPR spectroscopy.

Notably, the acyclic(amino)(aryl)carbene-based Chichibabin's hydrocarbon shows an appreciable population of the triplet state at room temperature, as evidenced by both variable-temperature NMR and EPR spectroscopy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sterically Frustrated Aromatic Enes with Various Colors Originating from Multiple Folded and Twisted Conformations in Crystal Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the crystalline state of sterically frustrated aromatic enes (FAEs) both twisted and folded carbon&#8211;carbon double bonds coexist. FAEs exhibit various absorption and emission colors from yellow to orange and from orange to dark red, just like beautiful autumn leaves. These color differences correspond to the multiple energetically close metastable conformations of the FAEs, which differ in the twist and fold angles of the C=C bond and the dihedral angle of the aryl unit relative to the C=C bond. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Nishiuchi, T. Kubo, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200286).

         <title>Lipid A mimetics based on unnatural disaccharide scaffold as potent TLR4 agonists for prospective immunotherapeutics and adjuvants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>TLR4 is a key pattern recognition receptor that can sense pathogen&#8208; and danger&#8208; associated molecular patterns to activate the downstream signaling pathways which results in the upregulation of transcription factors and expression of interferons and cytokines to mediate protective pro&#8208;inflammatory responses involved in immune defense. Bacterial lipid A is the primary TLR4 ligand with very complex, species&#8208;specific, and barely predictable structure&#8208;activity relationships. Given that therapeutic targeting of TLR4 is an emerging tool for management of a variety of human diseases, the development of novel TLR4 activating biomolecules other than lipid A is of vast importance. We report on design, chemical synthesis and immunobiology of novel glycan&#8208;based lipid A&#8208;mimicking molecules that can activate human and murine TLR4&#8208;mediated signaling with picomolar affinity. Exploiting crystal structure &#8208; based design we have created novel disaccharide lipid A mimetics (DLAMs) where the inherently flexible &#946;(1&#8594;6)&#8208;linked diglucosamine backbone of lipid A is exchanged with a conformationally restrained non&#8208;reducing &#946;GlcN(1&#8596;1&#180;)&#946;GlcN scaffold. Excellent stereoselectivity in a challenging  &#946;,&#946;  &#8208;1,1&#180; glycosylation was achieved by tuning the reactivities of donor and acceptor molecules using protective group manipulation strategy. Divergent streamlined synthesis of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;1,1&#180;&#8208;linked diglucosamine&#8208;derived glycolipids entailing multiple long&#8208;chain (  R  )&#8208;3&#8208;  O  &#8208;acyloxyacyl residues and up two three phosphate groups was developed. Specific 3D&#8208;molecular shape and conformational rigidity of unnatural  &#946;,&#946;  &#8208;1,1&#180;&#8208;linked diglucosamine combined with carefully optimized phosphorylation and acylation pattern ensured efficient induction of the TLR4&#8208;mediated signaling in a species&#8208;independent manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;phase peptide modification via deaminative photochemical Csp3&#8208;Csp3 bond formation using Katritzky salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introduction of unnatural amino acids can significantly improve the binding affinity and stability of peptides. Commercial availability of such amino acids is limited, and their synthesis is a long and tedious process. We here describe a method that allows the functionalization of peptides directly on solid&#8208;support by converting lysine residues to Katritzky salts, and subjecting them to a photochemical Giese reaction under mild reaction conditions. The method avoids the need for amino acid synthesis and instead offers a late&#8208;stage modification route for rapid peptide diversification. While numerous modification approaches at the lysine amine have been described, this work provides the first example of deaminative functionalization of peptides at lysine. The two&#8208;step protocol is compatible with various substrates, lysine analogues, resins, and all proteinogenic amino acids. Finally, by leveraging solid&#8208;phase modification, this protocol facilitates the functionalization of longer peptides as was demonstrated using biologically relevant peptides of up to 15 amino acids.</dc:description>

         <title>A Quasi&#8208;Two&#8208;Dimensional Trilayered CsPbBr3&#8208;based Dion&#8722;Jacobson Hybrid Perovskite toward High&#8208;Performance Photodetection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (Q&#8208;2D) Dion&#8722;Jacobson (DJ) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites based on CsPbBr3  are promising candidates for photodetection. Previous studies have predicted that the photoresponse of such materials with high inorganic&#8208;layer numbers (n) will be more protruding in this portfolio. However, until now, only bilayered (n = 2) CsPbBr3&#8208;based DJ&#8208;type hybrid perovskites are obtained and the higher number of layers (n &gt; 2) remain completely unexplored, owing to the relatively high formation energies. Here, by incorporating diamine into the 3D CsPbBr3  motif, a new Q&#8208;2D trilayered CsPbBr  3  &#8208;based DJ&#8208;type hybrid perovskite that contains organic cation and inorganic Cs metal, namely (4&#8208;AMP)Cs2Pb3Br10  (1, 4&#8208;AMP  2+  = 4&#8208;(aminomethyl)piperidinium, n = 3), is obtained. Excitingly,  1  exhibits excellent photoresponse, superior to its single&#8208;layered and bilayered counterparts. The resulting photodetectors thus exhibit large on/off ratio (&gt; 10  3  ), high photodetectivity (6.5 &#215; 10&#160;  10  Jones) and fast response speed (193 &#956;s). As far as we know,  1  is the first Q&#8208;2D CsPbBr3&#8208;based DJ&#8208;type hybrid perovskites with high n numbers. Our results may widen the range of the potential material in application of photodetection and will be helpful to design hybrid perovskites for other advanced optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Genuine Pores  in a Stable Zinc Phosphite for High H2 Adsorption  and CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An uncommon example of stable mixed&#8208;ligand zinc phosphite with genuine pores was synthesized by zinc metal, inorganic phosphite acid, thio&#8208;functionalized O&#8208;donor (2,5&#8208;thiophenedicarboxylate, TPDC), and tetradentate N&#8208;donor [1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrakis(imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethyl)benzene, TIMB] building units assembled into one crystalline structure grown by hydro(solvo)thermal method. This is a very rare case of metal phosphite incorporating both N&#8208; and O&#8208;donor ligands. The tetradentate TIMB linker bond to zinc atoms of the isolated zincophosphite hexamers to form a 3D open&#8208;framework structure by cross&#8208;linking of structural components of 1D chains and 2D layers. Here, the TPDC ligand acts as a monodentate binding modal to functionalize its porous structure with the uncoordinated S atom and COO  &#8722;  group. Remarkably, this compound demonstrates the highest H  2  storage capacity among organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal phosphates (and phosphites) and an excellent CO  2  capture at 298 K compared with the majority of crystalline materials. The possible adsorption sites and selectivity for CO  2  over H  2  , N  2  , and CO at 298 K were calculated using density functional theory (DFT), the ideal adsorption solution theory (IAST), and fitting experimental pure&#8208;component adsorption data.</dc:description>

         <title>Interplay of Anion&#8722;&#960;+ and &#960;+&#8722;&#960;+ Interactions &#8230;.. Applications in Live Cell Mitochondrial Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, the concept of anion&#8208;  &#960;  +  interactions has witnessed unique applications in the field of AIEgen development. In this contribution, we disclose a consolidated study of a library of N&#8208;doped ionic AIEgens accessed through silver&#8208;mediated cyclization of pyridino&#8208;alkynes. A thorough photophysical, computational and crystallographic study has been conducted to rationalize the observed substituent&#8208; and counterion&#8208;dependant fluorescence properties of these luminogens. We further elucidate the prominent role of anion&#8208;  &#960;  +  interactions,  &#960;  +  &#8208;  &#960;  +  interactions and other non&#8208;covalent interactions, in inhibiting the undesired ACQ effect. Finally, we have also demonstrated the application of selected AIEgens for imaging of mitochondria in live cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Pulsed Laser Excited Photoacoustic Effect for Disease Diagnosis and Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pulsed laser can excite light absorber to generate photoacoustic (PA) effect, that is, when the absorber is irradiated with pulsed laser, the absorbed light energy is converted into local heat to cause rapid thermoelastic expansion and generate acoustic wave. The generated PA signal has been widely employed for the diagnosis of many diseases with superb contrast, high penetrability and sensitivity. In addition, with the increase of pulsed laser energy, the resulting PA shockwave and cavitation can promote efficient drug release at lesion sites to potentiate the resulting therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, the PA shockwave/cavitation can mechanically inhibit disease and produce reactive species. In this Concept article, the principle and research status of pulsed laser excited disease theranostics are briefly summarized, extra suggestions are proposed to inspire extensive PA probes and photodynamic materials as well as novel methodologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Spirocyclic Cyclobutenes through Desulfinative Spirocyclisation of gem&#8208;Bis(triflyl)cyclobutenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A two&#8208;step synthesis of less accessible spiro[cyclobutene&#8208;1,9'&#8208;fluorene] compounds from biaryl&#8208;alkynes and 2&#8208;(2&#8208;fluoropyridin&#8208;1&#8208;ium&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,1&#8208;bis((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;ide, which serves as a potent precursor for outstandingly electrophilic Tf  2  C=CH  2  , has been developed. This synthetic methodology includes selective formation of  gem  &#8208;bis(triflyl)cyclobutenes from biaryl&#8208;alkynes and Tf  2  C=CH  2  followed by desulfinative spirocyclisation mediated by 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol (HFIP). Besides, on the basis of the chameleonic reactivity of sulfone functionality, several derivatisations of triflylated spiro[cyclobutene&#8208;1,9'&#8208;fluorene] products have been successfully achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>The Unexpected Helical Supramolecular Assembly of a Simple Achiral Acetamide Tecton Generates Selective Water Channels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achiral 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;N&#8208;(diphenylmethyl)acetamide (HNDPA) crystallizes in the  P  6  1  chiral space group as a hydrate, building up permeable chiral crystalline helical water channels. The crystallization driven chiral self&#8208;resolution process is highly robust, with the same air stable crystalline form readily obtained from a variety of conditions. Interestingly, the HNDPA supramolecular helix inner pore is filled by a helical water wire. The whole edifice is mainly stabilized by robust hydrogen bonds involving the HNDPA amide bonds and CH  &#8230;  &#960; interactions between the HNDPA phenyl groups. The crystalline structure shows a breathing behavior, with completely reversible release and reuptake of water inside the chiral channel, under ambient conditions. Importantly, the HNDPA channel is able to transport water very efficiently and selectively in biomimetic conditions. With a permeability per channel of 3.3 million water molecules per second in large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) and a total selectivity against NaCl, the HNDPA channel is a very promising functional nanomaterial for future applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Labelling of Peptides with o&#8208;Carboranes via Manganese(I)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A robust method for the selective labelling of peptides via manganese(I) catalysis was devised to achieve the C&#8208;2 alkenylation of tryptophan containing peptides with 1&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;o&#8208;carboranes. The manganese&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H activation was accomplished with high catalytic efficiency, and featured low toxicity, high functional group tolerance and excellent E&#8208;stereoselectivity. This approach unravels a promising tool for the assembly of o&#8208;carborane with structurally complex peptides of relevance to applications in boron neutron capture therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8211;X Bond Activation by Palladium:&#160; Steric Shielding versus Steric Attraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The C&#8211;X bond activation (X = H, C) of a series of substituted C(n&#176;)&#8211;H and C(n&#176;)&#8211;C(m&#176;) bonds with C(n&#176;) and C(m&#176;) = H 3 C&#8211; (methyl, 0&#176;), CH 3 H 2 C&#8211; (primary, 1&#176;), (CH 3 ) 2 HC&#8211; (secondary, 2&#176;), (CH 3 ) 3 C&#8211; (tertiary, 3&#176;) by palladium were investigated using relativistic dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;BLYP&#8208;D3(BJ)/TZ2P. We pinpoint the effect of the stepwise introduction of substituents at the C&#8211;X bond on the bond activation process. The C(n&#176;)&#8211;X bonds become substantially weaker going from C(0&#176;)&#8211;X, to C(1&#176;)&#8211;X, to C(2&#176;)&#8211;X, to C(3&#176;)&#8211;X because of the increasing steric repulsion between the C(n&#176;)&#8208; and X&#8208;group. Interestingly, this often does not lead to a lower barrier for the C(n&#176;)&#8211;X bond activation. The C&#8211;H activation barrier, for example, decreases from C(0&#176;)&#8211;X, to C(1&#176;)&#8211;X, to C(2&#176;)&#8211;X and then increases again for the very crowded C(3&#176;)&#8211;X bond. For the more congested C&#8211;C bond, in contrast, the activation barrier always increases as the degree of substitution is increased. Our activation strain and matching energy decomposition analyses reveal that these differences in C&#8211;H and C&#8211;C bond activation can be traced back to the opposing interplay between steric repulsion across the C&#8211;X bond versus that between the catalyst and substrate.</dc:description>

         <title>Inactivation of competitive decay channels leads to enhanced coumarin photochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the development of photolabile protecting groups, it is of high interest to selectively modify photochemical properties with structural changes as simple as possible. In this work, we want to adopt the knowledge of fluorophore optimization and use it to design new coumarin&#8208; based photocages. We selectively modulated the photolysis efficiency by inactivating competitive decay channels, such as twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) or hydogen&#8208;bonding and demonstrated the photolytic release of the neurotransmitter serotonin. Structural modifications inspired by the fluorophore ATTO 390 led to a significant increase in the uncaging cross section that can be further improved by the simple addition of a double bond. Using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, we gained insights into the underlying solvent&#8208;dependent photophysical dynamics. The chromophores presented here are excellently suited as new photocages in the visible wavelength range due to their simple synthesis and their superior photochemical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Green&#8208;Light Activatable BODIPY and Coumarin 5&#8217;&#8208;Caps for Oligonucleotide Photocaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We synthesized two green&#8208;light activatable 5&#8217;&#8208;caps for oligonucleotides based on the BODIPY and coumarin scaffold. Both bear an alkyne functionality allowing their use in numerous biological applications. They were successfully incorporated in oligonucleotides via solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Copper&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) using a bisazide photo&#8208;tether gave cyclic oligonucleotides that could be relinearized by activation with green light and were shown to exhibit high stability against exonucleases. Chemical ligation as another example for bioconjugation yielded oligonucleotides with an internal strand break site. Irradiation at 530 nm or 565 nm resulted in complete photolysis of both caging groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Broad&#8208;spectrum antidote discovery by untangling the reactivation mechanism of nerve agent inhibited acetylcholinesterase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactivators are vital for the treatment of organophosphorus nerve agent (OPNA) intoxication but new alternatives are needed due to their limited clinical applicability. The toxicity of OPNAs stems from covalent inhibition of the essential enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which reactivators relieve via a chemical reaction with the inactivated enzyme. Here, we present new strategies and tools for developing reactivators. We discover suitable inhibitor scaffolds by using an activity&#8208;independent competition assay to study non&#8208;covalent interactions with OPNA&#8208;AChEs and transform these inhibitors into broad&#8208;spectrum reactivators. Moreover, we identify determinants of reactivation efficiency by analysing reactivation and pre&#8208;reactivation kinetics together with structural data. Our results show that new OPNA reactivators can be discovered rationally by exploiting detailed knowledge of the reactivation mechanism of OPNA&#8208;inhibited AChE.</dc:description>

         <title>Anticancer Aminoferrocene Derivatives Inducing Production of Mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual aminoferrocene (AF) agent (3&#8201;d) is reported, which does not react with reactive oxygen species (ROS) in contrast to usual AF agents (e.&#8201;g., 3&#8201;b) and exhibits excellent anticancer effects in a variety of cancer cells and in a murine cancer Nemeth&#8208;Kellner lymphoma (NK/Ly) model. The mode of action relies on the increase of the level of mitochondrial ROS (mROS), whereas usual AF agents (e.&#8201;g. 3&#8201;b) do not affect mROS.







Abstract
Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and deficient mitochondria are two weak points of cancer cells. Their simultaneous targeting is a valid therapeutic strategy to design highly potent anticancer drugs. The remaining challenge is to limit the drug effects to cancer cells without affecting normal ones. We have previously developed three aminoferrocene (AF)&#8208;based derivatives, which are activated in the presence of elevated levels of ROS present in cancer cells with formation of electron&#8208;rich compounds able to generate ROS and reduce mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). All of them exhibit important drawbacks including either low efficacy or high unspecific toxicity that prevents their application in&#8197;vivo up to date. Herein we describe unusual AF&#8208;derivatives lacking these drawbacks. These compounds act via an alternative mechanism: they are chemically stable in the presence of ROS, generate mitochondrial ROS in cancer cells, but not normal cells and exhibit anticancer effect in&#8197;vivo.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Reductive Coupling of para&#8208;Quinone Methides with 4&#8208;Cyanopyridines Enabled by Pyridine&#8208;Boryl Radicals: Access to Pyridylated Diarylmethanes with Anti&#8208;Cancer Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly diverse pyridylated diarylmethanes are rapidly synthesized in metal&#8208;free process mediated by B2pin2/4&#8208;cyanopyridine system. In this reaction, the pyridine&#8208;boryl radical addition to C=O bond of p&#8208;QMs 1 promotes the generation of diarylmethane radicals, which are then coupled with pyridine&#8208;boryl radicals to obtain the desired products 3. The utility of the method was highlighted by biological activity identification.







Abstract
Reported herein is a streamlined protocol to produce pyridylated diarylmethanes through pyridine&#8208;boryl radical induced reductive coupling between para&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) and 4&#8208;cyanopyridines using bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2pin2) as a templated reagent. The metal&#8208;free process is characterized by an operationally simple approach, excellent chemoselectivity (1,2&#8208; vs. 1,6&#8208;selectivity), and a broad substrate scope with good functional group compatibility. The mechanistic studies provided important insights into the reductive cross&#8208;coupling process between diarylmethyl radical and pyridine&#8208;boryl radical. Moreover, part of the obtained pyridylated diarylmethane products were screened against a panel of cancer cell lines, and 3&#8201;v was confirmed to significantly inhibit the proliferation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells. This method offers a platform for the preparation of new lead compounds with antitumor activity.

         <title>Stable Triarylmethyl Radicals and Cobalt(II) Ions Based 1D/2D Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazole&#8208;substituted tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl radical ligands (L1 and L2) were synthesized in a facile way. They are stable and can be used to construct crystalline 1D and 2D open&#8208;shell coordination polymers (CoCP&#8208;1 and CoCP&#8208;2) with cobalt(II) ions. Both polymers show antiferromagnetic interaction between carbon&#8208;centered radicals and the high&#8208;spin Co(II) ions.







Abstract
The incorporation of organic radicals into coordination polymers was considered as a promising strategy to promote metal&#8208;ligand exchange interactions, but there are only a very limited number of stable organic radical&#8208;based ligands that can serve well such a purpose. Herein, we report two new tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical&#8208;based ligands L1 and L2 with two and three imidazole substituents, respectively. The imidazole unit serves as a coordination site and it can also stabilize the TTM radical by intramolecular donor&#8211;acceptor interaction. Coordination of L1 and L2 with cobalt(II) ions gave the corresponding one&#8208; (CoCP&#8208;1) and two&#8208;dimensional (CoCP&#8208;2) coordination polymers, the structures of which were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Magnetic measurements and theoretical calculations suggest antiferromagnetic coupling between the paramagnetic cobalt(II) ions and the radical ligands. Our study provides a rational design for stable organic radical&#8208;based ligands and further demonstrated the feasibility of a metal&#8211;radical approach toward magnetic materials.

         <title>Orthogonalization of Polyaryl Linkers as a Route to More Porous Phosphonate Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orthogonalization of components inhibits efficient packing, whether of bagels or polyaryl linkers in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). This strategy was applied to polyphosphonate linkers to generate six new MOF structures (CALF&#8208;35 to &#8208;39). Ba, Sr, Mg, Zn and two Ca structures were obtained from a new trigonal linker with orthogonal peripheral aryl rings to inhibit efficient packing. The structures are discussed considering their porosity, stability and selective sorption of gases.







Abstract
The coordinative pliancy of the phosphonate functional group means that metal&#8208;phosphonate materials often self&#8208;assemble as well&#8208;packed structures with minimal porosity, as efficient inter&#8208;ligand packing is enabled. Here, we report a multistep synthesis of a novel aryl&#8208;phosphonate linker with an orthogonalized ligand core, 1,3,5&#8208;tris(4&#8217;&#8208;phosphonophenyl)&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzene (H6L2) designed to form more open structures. A series of crystalline metal&#8208;phosphonate frameworks (CALF&#8208;35 to &#8208;39) have been assembled by coordinating to divalent metals (Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg, Zn). H6L2 is unable to pack efficiently and, as a consequence, yields several distinct microporous structures. The resulting structures are discussed in detail, with a focus on the solid&#8208;state packing of the sterically rigidified linker. Combined with larger cations (Sr, and Ba), H6L2 packs in a parallel&#8208;offset manner, yielding isomorphous and microporous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (CALF&#8208;35 (Sr), and (Ba)). When coordinated to smaller metals (Ca, Mg, Zn), H6L2 forms four new structures. Two Ca MOFs of different stoichiometry, (CALF&#8208;36 and 37) and a Mg MOF CALF&#8208;38 show narrow pores and have high selectivities for CO2 over N2 and CH4. Finally, in CALF&#8208;39 (Zn), H6L2 linkers pack in a herringbone fashion, resulting in a material with 10.9&#215;10.1&#8197;&#197;2 square channels. The stability of all structures was tested, and the most porous structure, CALF&#8208;39 (Zn), was found to retain its structure and gas adsorption after immersion in water over pH&#8197;3&#8211;11.

A series of crystalline metal-phosphonate frameworks (CALF-35 to -39) have been assembled by coordinating to divalent metals (Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg, Zn). H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;L2 is unable to pack efficiently and, as a consequence, yields several distinct microporous structures. The resulting structures are discussed in detail, with a focus on the solid-state packing of the sterically rigidified linker. Combined with larger cations (Sr, and Ba), H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;L2 packs in a parallel-offset manner, yielding isomorphous and microporous metal-organic frameworks (CALF-35 (Sr), and (Ba)). When coordinated to smaller metals (Ca, Mg, Zn), H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;L2 forms four new structures. Two Ca MOFs of different stoichiometry, (CALF-36 and 37) and a Mg MOF CALF-38 show narrow pores and have high selectivities for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Finally, in CALF-39 (Zn), H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;L2 linkers pack in a herringbone fashion, resulting in a material with 10.9&#215;10.1&#8197;&#197;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; square channels. The stability of all structures was tested, and the most porous structure, CALF-39 (Zn), was found to retain its structure and gas adsorption after immersion in water over pH&#8197;3&#8211;11.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conversion of CH4 Catalyzed by Gas Phase Ions Containing Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review article discusses the significant progress that has been made for catalytic methane conversion in the gas phase, with focus on the coupling reactions of CH4 molecules and of CH4 with other substrates (O2, O3, N2O, CO2, and H2O) catalyzed by ions containing metals. The mechanistic details for generation of C&#8722;C coupling and C&#8208;O coupling products from methane have been provided at a strictly molecular level.







Abstract
Methane is an abundant and cheap feedstock to produce valuable chemicals. The catalytic reaction of methane conversion generally requires the participation of multiple molecules (such as two or three CH4 molecules, O2, CO2, etc.). Such complex process includes the cleavage of original chemical bonds, formation of new chemical bonds, and desorption of products. The gas phase study provides a unique arena to gain molecular&#8208;level insights into the detailed mechanisms of bond&#8208;breaking and bond&#8208;forming involved in complicated catalytic reactions. In this Review, we introduce the methane conversion catalyzed by gas phase ions containing metals and three topics will be discussed: (1) the direct coupling of methane molecules, (2) the conversion of CH4 with O2, O3 and N2O, and (3) the conversion of CH4 with CO2 and H2O. The obtained mechanistic aspects may provide new clues for rational design of better&#8208;performing catalysts for conversion of methane to value&#8208;added products.

         <title>Site Occupancies, Electron&#8211;Vibration Interaction and Energy Transfer of CaMgSi2O6: Eu2+, Mn2+ Phosphors for Potential Temperature&#8208;Sensing and Anti&#8208;counterfeiting Applications</title>

         <dc:description>
The two&#8208;site occupancies, the electron&#8211;vibration interaction analyses of Mn2+, and the Eu2+&#8722;Mn2+ energy transfer are discussed. The different thermal quenching behaviours and emission colours of Eu2+ and Mn2+ ions in CaMgSi2O6 endow the co&#8208;doped samples with potential applications in temperature&#8208;sensing and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.







Abstract
Eu2+&#8208;, Mn2+&#8208; and Eu2+&#8722;Mn2+&#8208;doped CaMgSi2O6 phosphors have been prepared by a high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state reaction. Systematic investigation of the concentration&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent luminescence of Mn2+ showed that Mn2+ ions occupy two distinct sites in CaMgSi2O6. Electron&#8211;vibration interaction (EVI) analyses of Mn2+ ions revealed Huang&#8211;Rhys factors of 4.73 and 2.82 as well as effective phonon energies of 313 and 383&#8197;cm&#8722;1 for the two sites. Eu2+&#8722;Mn2+ energy transfer is also discussed, and its efficiency is estimated by lifetime and luminescence spectra. The different thermal quenching behaviours of Eu2+ and Mn2+, the distinct emission colours of Eu2+ (blue, band peak at &#8764;451&#8197;nm) and Mn2+ (yellow&#8211;red range, band peaks at &#8764;583 and 693&#8197;nm) endow the co&#8208;doped samples with potential applications in luminescence thermometry and temperature&#8208;/excitation wavelength&#8208;responsive dual anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Generalizing the Aromatic &#948;&#8208;Amino Acid Foldamer Helix</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quinoline (Q), pyridine (P), and benzene&#8208;based (B) &#948;&#8208;amino acids are shown to be compatible in that sequences comprised of these units generally fold into canonical aromatic helical conformations in water. Exceptions include (P)n and (B)n sequences, but not (PB)n. Helix handedness inversion rates are considerably reduced upon introducing a small proportion of Q monomers. The position of side chains can be modulated upon changing the Q/B ratio.







Abstract
A series of aromatic oligoamide foldamer sequences containing different proportions of three &#948;&#8208;amino acids derived from quinoline, pyridine, and benzene and possessing varying flexibility, for example due to methylene bridges, were synthesized. Crystallographic structures of two key sequences and 1H NMR data in water concur to show that a canonical aromatic helix fold prevails in almost all cases and that helix stability critically depends on the ratio between rigid and flexible units. Notwithstanding subtle variations of curvature, i.&#8201;e. the numbers of units per turn, the aromatic &#948;&#8208;peptide helix is therefore shown to be general and tolerant of a great number of sp3 centers. We also demonstrate canonical helical folding upon alternating two monomers that do not promote folding when taken separately: folding occurs with two methylenes between every other unit, not with one methylene between every unit. These findings highlight that a fine&#8208;tuning of helix handedness inversion kinetics, curvature, and side chain positioning in aromatic &#948;&#8208;peptidic foldamers can be realized by systematically combining different yet compatible &#948;&#8208;amino acids.

         <title>The Role of Radical Bridges in Polynuclear Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In N
&#8208;radical&#8208;bridged diterbium complexes, the radical bridge induces crystal&#8208;field and magnetic anisotropy that interferes destructively with that of the outer ligands. The performance of polynuclear exchange&#8208;coupled SMMs may be significantly enhanced if the crystal&#8208;field and magnetic anisotropy induced by the local ligands and the bridging ligands are engineered collinear to each other.







Abstract
Employing radical bridges between anisotropic metal ions has been a viable route to achieve high&#8208;performance single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). While the bridges have been mainly considered for their ability to promote exchange interactions, the crystal&#8208;field effect arising from them has not been taken into account explicitly. This lack of consideration may distort the understanding and limit the development of the entire family. To shed light on this aspect, herein we report a theoretical investigation of a series of N
&#8208;radical&#8208;bridged diterbium complexes. It is found that while promoting strong exchange coupling between the terbium ions, the N
&#8208;radical induces a crystal field that interferes destructively with that of the outer ligands, and thus reduces the overall SMM behavior. Based on the theoretical results, we conclude that the SMM behavior in this series could be further maximized if the crystal field of the outer ligands is designed to be collinear with that of the radical bridge. This conclusion can be generalized to all exchange&#8208;coupled SMMs.

         <title>Mesoionic Dithiolates (MIDts) Derived from 1,3&#8208;Imidazole&#8208;Based Anionic Dicarbenes (ADCs)</title>

         <dc:description>
Mesoionic dithiolates Li(MIDts) as well as heteroleptic (MIDt)GeCl and homoleptic (MIDt)2Ge germylenes are reported as crystalline solids. The germylene (MIDt)2Ge features the highest&#8208;lying HOMO (&#8722;4.37&#8197;eV) and has the smallest HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap (2.82&#8197;eV) among the hitherto known germylenes. Insertion of GeCl2 into the Ge&#8722;Cl bond of (MIDt)GeCl affords the Ge&#8722;Ge catenation product (MIDt)GeGeCl3, a mixed&#8208;valence Ge(+1)/Ge(+3) compound.







Abstract
Mesoionic dithiolates [(MIDtAr)Li(LiBr)2(THF)3] (MIDtAr={SC(NDipp)}2CAr; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; Ar=Ph 3&#8201;a, 3&#8208;MeC6H4 (3&#8208;Tol) 3&#8201;b, 4&#8208;Me2NC6H4 (DMP) 3&#8201;c) and [(MIDtPh)Li(THF)2] (4) are readily accessible (in&#8805;90&#8201;% yields) as crystalline solids on treatments of anionic dicarbenes Li(ADCAr) (2&#8201;a&#8208;c) (ADCAr={C(NDipp)2}2CAr) with elemental sulfur. 3&#8201;a&#8208;c and 4 are monoanionic ditopic ligands with both the sulfur atoms formally negatively charged, while the 1,3&#8208;imidazole unit bears a formal positive charge. Treatment of 4 with (L)GeCl2 (L=1,4&#8208;dioxane) affords the germylene (MIDtPh)GeCl (5) featuring a three&#8208;coordinated Ge atom. 5 reacts with (L)GeCl2 to give the Ge&#8722;Ge catenation product (MIDtPh)GeGeCl3 (6). KC8 reduction of 5 yields the homoleptic germylene (MIDtPh)2Ge (7). Compounds 3&#8201;a&#8208;c and 4&#8211;7 have been characterized by spectroscopic studies and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The electronic structures of 4&#8211;7 have been analyzed by DFT calculations.

         <title>Glucosylated 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylpyrimidines as Epigenetic DNA Bases Regulating Transcription and Restriction Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glucosylation's glitches: Glucosylated 5&#8208;hydroxymethylpyrimidines were studied as epigenetic DNA modifications that fully inhibit the cleavage of DNA by restriction endonucleases. However, only the presence of glucosylated 5hmU inhibited transcription, whereas DNA containing glucosylated 5hmC remained transcriptionally active. This suggests a role for glucosylation by T4 phage &#946;&#8208;glucosyltransferase.







Abstract
5&#8208;(&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;Glucopyranosyloxymethyl)&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridine and &#8208;cytidine 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;triphosphates were prepared and used for polymerase&#8208;mediated (primer extension or PCR) synthesis of DNA containing glucosylated 5&#8208;hydroxymethyluracil (5hmU) or 5&#8208;hydroxymethyluracil (5hmC). The presence of any glucosylated pyrimidines fully protected DNA from cleavage by type II restriction endonucleases. On the other hand, while the presence of glucosylated 5hmU completely inhibited transcription by bacterial (Escherichia coli) RNA polymerase, the DNA containing the corresponding glucosylated 5hmC allowed a similar level of transcription as natural DNA. This suggests different roles of these hypermodified bases in the epigenetic regulation of transcription in bacteriophages or kinetoplastid parasites. Consequently, enzymatic glucosylation of 5hmC&#8208;containing DNA can be used for tuning of transcription activity.

         <title>Functional Groups Assisted Tunable Dielectric Permittivity of Guest&#8208;Free Zn&#8208;Based Coordination Polymers for Gate Dielectrics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dielectric tuning of two Zn&#8208;based coordination polymers via the tuning of the electron&#8208;donating (R=NH2) and electron&#8208;withdrawing (R=NO2) groups is reported. The tunable high dielectric properties, wide bandgaps and thermal stability of these CPs clearly demonstrate their potential for use in the design of future gate dielectric materials.







Abstract
The dielectric properties of coordination polymers has been a topic of recent interest, but the role of different functional groups on the dielectric properties of these polymers has not yet been fully addressed. Herein, the effects of electron&#8208;donating (R=NH2) and electron&#8208;withdrawing (R=NO2) groups on the dielectric behavior of such materials were investigated for two thermally stable and guest&#8208;free Zn&#8208;based coordination polymers, [Zn(L1)(L2)]n (1) and [Zn(L1)(L3)]n (2) [L1=2&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl) benzimidazole (Pbim), L2=5&#8208;aminoisophthalate (Aip), and L3=5&#8208;nitroisophthalate (Nip)]. The results of dielectric studies of 1 revealed that it possesses a high dielectric constant (&#954;=65.5 at 1&#8197;kHz), while compound 2 displayed an even higher dielectric constant (&#954;=110.3 at 1&#8197;kHz). The electron donating and withdrawing effects of the NH2 and NO2 substituents induce changes in the polarity of the polymers, which is due to the inductive effect from the aryl ring for both NO2 and NH2. Theoretical results from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which also support the experimental findings, show that both compounds have a distinct electronic behavior with diverse wide bandgaps. The significance of the current work is to provide information about the structure&#8208;dielectric property relationships. So, this study promises to pave the way for further research on the effects of different functional groups on coordination polymers on their dielectric properties.

         <title>A Carbene&#8208;Stabilized Boryl&#8208;Phosphinidene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
What hides within: Three different singlet boryl phosphinidenes were synthesized by using cAAC carbene, and their inversely polarized phosphaalkene characteristics were investigated. Quantum mechanical studies suggest that the P center of these boryl phosphinidenes contains two lone pairs viz., an &#963;&#8208;type lone pair and a &#8220;hidden&#8221; &#960;&#8208;type lone pair.







Abstract
Herein, the synthesis and characterization of the carbene&#8208;stabilized boryl phosphinidenes 1&#8211;3 are reported. Compounds 1&#8211;3 are obtained by reacting Me&#8208;cAAC=PK (Me2&#8208;cAAC=dimethyl cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene) and dihaloaryl borane in toluene. All three compounds were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Quantum mechanical studies indicated that these compounds have two lone pairs on the P center viz., an &#963;&#8208;type lone pair and a &#8220;hidden&#8221; &#960;&#8208;type lone pair. Hence, these compounds can act as double Lewis bases, and the basicity of the &#960;&#8208;type lone pair is higher than the &#963;&#8208;type lone pair.

     alt="A Carbene-Stabilized Boryl-Phosphinidene"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What hides within&lt;/b&gt;: Three different singlet boryl phosphinidenes were synthesized by using cAAC carbene, and their inversely polarized phosphaalkene characteristics were investigated. Quantum mechanical studies suggest that the P center of these boryl phosphinidenes contains two lone pairs viz., an &#963;-type lone pair and a &#8220;hidden&#8221; &#960;-type lone pair.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, the synthesis and characterization of the carbene-stabilized boryl phosphinidenes &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; are reported. Compounds &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; are obtained by reacting Me-cAAC=PK (Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-cAAC=dimethyl cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene) and dihaloaryl borane in toluene. All three compounds were characterized by X-ray crystallography. Quantum mechanical studies indicated that these compounds have two lone pairs on the P center viz., an &#963;-type lone pair and a &#8220;hidden&#8221; &#960;-type lone pair. Hence, these compounds can act as double Lewis bases, and the basicity of the &#960;-type lone pair is higher than the &#963;-type lone pair.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Preparation of a Large Amount of Ultrathin Graphdiyne</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a facile strategy to prepare a large amount of ultrathin graphdiyne (GDY) with good crystallinity in the mixture of oil&#8208;water systems. By simply mixing the solution of GDY monomer in CHCl  3  and the copper acetate solution as a catalyst in water and stirring at room temperature, ultrathin GDY films with a thickness of ~4 nm were obtained in a yield of 95%. This work provides a feasible path for the substantial preparation of GDY films and may pave the way to the development of substantial preparation of the GDY materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Graphene&#8208;based nanomaterials for solar&#8208;driven overall water splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven overall water splitting is a promising strategy to store solar energy in the form of green hydrogen, but its hydrogen generation efficiency is still low despite years of research. Graphene has attracted great attention in solar&#8208;driven overall water splitting because it has quite versatile properties and is able to act as photo harvester, electron mediator and cocatalyst in a photocatalysis system. Herein, a review of graphene&#8208;based nanomaterials for solar&#8208;driven overall water splitting is presented. The review starts from two commonly&#8208;used methods, photocatalysis and photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, and the fundamentals of these two methods. The approaches for the preparation of photocatalysts and photoelectrodes containing graphene are presented and the roles of graphene are discussed. Accordingly, the challenges and prospects of the future applications of graphene in solar&#8208;driven water splitting are highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Taming of Singlet Oxygen: Towards Artificial Oxygen Carriers based on 1,4&#8208;Dialkylnaphthalenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Naphthalene endoperoxides are known as convenient sources of singlet oxygen (O 2 , 1 &#916; g ) which is the major product of endoperoxide cycloreversion reaction. However, their potential as carriers of ground state molecular oxygen (O 2 , 3 &#931; g ) similar to artificial oxygen carriers remain largely unexplored. This is due to the extreme reactivity and cytotoxic effects of the released singlet oxygen. We now report that a compound with a bimodular design, which incorporates an endoperoxide and an efficient physical quencher of singlet oxygen, DABCO, produces exclusively ground state molecular oxygen. This result, coupled with the fact that oxygen release rates from endoperoxides are highly amenable to fine tuning in a very broad range, and open to targeting by ligand attachment, raises the potential of these compounds far above any comparable chemical, or even biochemical sources. In cell culture experiments, we showed that the addition of the endoperoxide&#8208;quencher conjugate can enhance and sustain cell proliferation.</dc:description>

         <title>A new look at molecular and electronic structure of homoleptic diiron(II,II) complexes with N,N&#8208;bidentate ligands: Combined experimental and theoretical study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Paddlewheel&#8208;type dinuclear complexes featuring metal&#8211;metal bonding have been the subject of widespread interest due to fundamental concern in their electronic structures and potential applications. Here, we explore the molecular and electronic structures of diiron(II,II) complexes with N,N&#8217;&#8208;diarylformamidinate ligands. While a paddlewheel&#8208;type diiron(II,II) complex with N,N&#8217;&#8208;diphenylformamidinate ligands (DPhF) exhibits the centrosymmetric [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;DPhF)4] structure, a minor alteration in the ligand system, i.e. switching from phenyl to p&#8208;tolyl N&#8208;substituted formamidinate ligand (DTolF), resulted in the isolation of an unprecedented non&#8208;centrosymmetric [Fe(&#956;&#8208;DTolF)3Fe(&#954;2&#8208;DTolF)] complex. Both complexes were characterized using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, magnetic measurements, 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry along with high&#8208;level ab&#8208;initio calculations. The results provide a new view on a range of factors controlling the ground&#8208;state electronic configuration and structural diversity of homoleptic diiron(II,II) complexes. Interestingly, the Mayer bond orders for the Fe&#8208;Fe interactions are significantly lower than 1 and equal to 0.15 and 0.28 for [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;DPhF)4] and [Fe(&#956;&#8208;DTolF)3Fe(&#954;2&#8208;DTolF)], respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Diverse supports for immobilization of catalysts in continuous flow reactors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid development of continuous flow processes is driving innovations in various chemical syntheses and industrial productions. Immobilizing catalysts in flow reactors allows transformations with high&#8208;efficiency and excludes the subsequent separation procedures. This concept outlines the approaches to incorporate catalysts within flow reactors, with particular focus on the application of additional supports including inorganic materials like silica, zeolite and reduced graphene oxide, polymeric materials like polymer packings, monoliths, cross&#8208;linked gels and polymer brushes, and other materials for specific conditions like transparent glass fibers and glass beads. Furthermore, advanced methods to develop ordered micro&#8208;/nanoarrays from internal walls of flow channels for immobilization of catalysts as well as application of innovative vortex fluidic devices are discussed to inspire new designs of supports for novel fluidic reactors with broad applications.</dc:description>

         <title>New Materials formed by combining Inorganic Glasses and Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combining glassy or crystalline metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with inorganic glasses to create novel hybrid composites and blends is proposed. The motivation behind this new composite approach is to improve the processability issues and mechanical performance of MOFs, whilst maintaining their ubiquitous properties. Herein, the precepts of successful composite formation and pairing of MOF and glass MOFs with inorganic glasses are presented. Focus is also given to the synthetic routes to such materials and the challenges anticipated in both their production and characterisation. Depending on their chemical nature, materials are classified as crystalline MOF&#8208;glass composites and blends. Additionally, the potential properties and applications of these two classes of materials are considered, the key aim being the retention of beneficial properties of both components, whilst circumventing their respective drawbacks.</dc:description>

         <title>An Orthogonal Dynamic Covalent Chemistry Tool for Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Cyclic Oligochalcogenides on Detachable Helical Peptide Templates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A model system is introduced as a general tool to elaborate on orthogonal templation of dynamic covalent ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ODC&#8208;TROP).&#160; The tool consists of 3  10  helical peptides as unprecedented templates and semicarbazones as orthogonal dynamic covalent linkers.&#160; With difficult&#8208;to&#8208;control 1,2&#8208;dithiolanes, ODC&#8208;TROP on the level of short model oligomers occurs with high templation efficiency, increasing and diminishing upon helix stabilization and denaturation, respectively.&#160; Further, an anti&#8208;templated conjugate with mispositioned monomers gave reduced templation upon helix twisting.&#160; Even with the &#8220;unpolymerizable&#8221; 1,2&#8208;diselenolanes, initial studies already afford mild templation efficiency.&#160; These proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle results promise that the here introduced tool, recyclable and enabling late&#8208;stage side chain modification, will be useful to realize ODC&#8208;TROP of intractable or unknown cyclic dynamic covalent monomers for dynamer materials as well as cellular uptake and signaling applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Properties of 5&#8208;Azido and 5&#8208;Nitramino&#8208;tetrazoles by Diverse Functionalization &#8211; General Concepts for Future Energetic Materials</title>

         <dc:description>5&#8208;Azido and 5&#8208;nitraminotetrazole backbones are established heterocyclic motifs in the research field of energetic materials synthesis. Despite the high energy content of the compounds, the problem with many derivatives is that their sensitivities are far too high. Functionalization of one of the ring nitrogen atoms is the aim of this study to adjust the sensitivity by inserting nitratoethyl, azidoethyl and methyl groups. In this context, derivatives of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;azidoethyl)&#8208;5&#8208;nitraminotetrazoles (  2  ,  2a  &#8208;  2d  ), as well as 1&#8208;nitrato and 1&#8208;azidoethyl substituted 5&#8208;azidotetrazole (  7  and  10  ) and the methylation products of 5&#8208;azidotetrazole (5&#8208;azido&#8208;1&#8208;methyl&#8208;tetrazole,  11  and 5&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;tetrazole,  12  ) were prepared. The obtained nitrogen&#8208;rich compounds were extensively characterized through multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and IR spectroscopy. The structural confinement was checked by X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments. The pure samples (verified by elemental analysis) were investigated regarding their behavior toward friction, impact (BAM methods) and electrostatic discharge as well as heating (DTA and DSC). For all metal&#8208;free compounds the detonation properties were computed with the EXPLO5 code using their density and heat of formation, calculated based on CBS&#8208;4M level of theory.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Control of Microbial Movement by Photoswitchable ATP Antagonists</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized compounds acting as antagonists of ATP and whose activity is reversibly changed by light. When the compound was given to a microorganism moving by flagella, the movement could be changed significantly and reversibly by alternating irradiation of two wavelengths. This means that we can freely control the ATP world that governs the energy flow of living things.







Abstract
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the energy source for various biochemical processes and biomolecular motors in living things. Development of ATP antagonists and their stimuli&#8208;controlled actions offer a novel approach to regulate biological processes. Herein, we developed azobenzene&#8208;based photoswitchable ATP antagonists for controlling the activity of motor proteins; cytoplasmic and axonemal dyneins. The new ATP antagonists showed reversible photoswitching of cytoplasmic dynein activity in an in&#8197;vitro dynein&#8208;microtubule system due to the trans and cis photoisomerization of their azobenzene segment. Importantly, our ATP antagonists reversibly regulated the axonemal dynein motor activity for the force generation in a demembranated model of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We found that the trans and cis isomers of ATP antagonists significantly differ in their affinity to the ATP binding site.

         <title>From Light to Structure: Photo Initiators for Radical Two&#8208;Photon Polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;photon polymerization has established itself as one of the most important techniques for the fabrication of 3D structures in the micro to nanometer range. To ensure precise and rapid fabrication, photo initiators (PI) are used that have been specially developed for this purpose. In this review article, the PIs known to the literature are listed and compared in particular according to their structural elements, fabrication behavior and two&#8208;photon cross&#8208;section.







Abstract
Two&#8208;photon polymerization (2PP) represents a powerful technique for the fabrication of precise three&#8208;dimensional structures on a micro&#8208; and nanometer scale for various applications. While many review articles are focusing on the used polymeric materials and their application in 2PP, in this review the class of two&#8208;photon photo initiators (2PI) used for radical polymerization is discussed in detail. Because the demand for highly efficient 2PI has increased in the last decades, different approaches in designing new efficient 2PIs occurred. This review summarizes the 2PIs known in literature and discusses their absorption behavior under one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) conditions, their two&#8208;photon cross sections (&#963;TPA) as well as their efficiency under 2PP conditions. Here, the photo initiators are grouped depending on their chromophore system (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D, D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D, etc.). Their polymerization efficiencies are evaluated by fabrication windows (FW) depending on different laser intensities and writing speeds.

         <title>Macrocyclic Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyads Composed of Oligothiophene Half&#8208;Cycles and Perylene Bisimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and properties of perylene bisimide dyes bridged by &#945;&#8208;oligothiophenes bearing four, five, six and seven thiophene units is described. Next to panchromatic light absorption in the UV/Vis spectrum, the compounds show donor bridge size&#8208;dependent electronic properties and excited state dynamics.







Abstract
A series of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) macrocyclic dyads consisting of an electron&#8208;poor perylene bisimide (PBI) &#960;&#8208;scaffold bridged with electron&#8208;rich &#945;&#8208;oligothiophenes bearing four, five, six and seven thiophene units between the two phenyl&#8208;imide substituents has been synthesized and characterized by steady&#8208;state UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, cyclic and differential pulse voltammetry as well as transient absorption spectroscopy. Tying the oligothiophene strands in a conformationally fixed macrocyclic arrangement leads to a more rigid &#960;&#8208;scaffold with vibronic fine structure in the respective absorption spectra. Electrochemical analysis disclosed charged state properties in solution which are strongly dependent on the degree of rigidification within the individual macrocycle. Investigation of the excited state dynamics revealed an oligothiophene bridge size&#8208;dependent fast charge transfer process for the macrocyclic dyads upon PBI subunit excitation.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding with Diaryl Ditellurides: Evidence from Solid&#8208;State and Solution Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the solid state, due to Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te interactions, diaryl ditellurides are facing to each other, like these &#8220;solid/frozen&#8221; Scottish cows in winter. Once the molecules are &#8220;defrosted&#8221; in solution, new interactions occur with soluble Lewis bases, including some solvents. More information can be found in the Research Article by Patrick Pale, V. Mamane and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200395).

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Thermal Synthesis of Extra&#8208;Large&#8208;Pore Aluminophosphate Zeotype via Self&#8208;Assembly of Double&#8208;Four&#8208;Ring Unit</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple solvent&#8208;free thermal synthesis method was developed to prepare extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore aluminophosphate zeotype DNL&#8208;1, unravelling its crystallization process via self&#8208;assembly of d4r unit, an intermediate formed at synthesis conditions of low water content in presence of a template structure with alkyl chains of proper length. This new synthesis strategy is suitable for rational preparation of d4r&#8208;containing extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolitic materials in the absence of Ge.







Abstract
The use of Ge as framework atom to direct the formation of double&#8208;four&#8208;ring (d4r) unit is an effective way to prepare zeolite with extra&#8208;large pores, which however also brings about serious problems with regard to production cost and structure stability for their practical application. A new solvent&#8208;free thermal synthesis strategy is presented here for facile preparation and molecular&#8208;level mechanism study of extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore aluminophosphate zeotype DNL&#8208;1 with &#8208;CLO structure. For the first time, the formation of intermediate d4r in the induction period was successfully confirmed, and was correlated with the synthesis condition of low water content and quaternary ammonium template with suitable alkyl chain length. The self&#8208;assembly pathway via d4r to form lta, afterwards clo and super cages was further revealed. This work shed light on the rational synthesis of Ge&#8208;free extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeotypes based on d4r route.

         <title>On the Mediated Electron Transfer of Immobilized Galactose Oxidase for Biotechnological Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrical wiring of galactose oxidase with a redox polymer is proven to support bio&#8208;electrocatalytic conversions with minimal interference from O2, thereby enabling the oxidation of primary alcohols while decreasing the associated production of harmful H2O2. A practical example is shown for the conversion of bio&#8208;renewable substrates. Product evaluation is used to investigate whether or not carboxylic acid derivatives are obtained after accumulation of the aldehyde product in the reaction medium.







Abstract
The use of enzymes as catalysts in chemical synthesis offers advantages in terms of clean and highly selective transformations. Galactose oxidase (GalOx) is a remarkable enzyme with several applications in industrial conversions as it catalyzes the oxidation of primary alcohols. We have investigated the wiring of GalOx with a redox polymer; this enables mediated electron transfer with the electrode surface for its potential application in biotechnological conversions. As a result of electrochemical regeneration of the catalytic center, the formation of harmful H2O2 is minimized during enzymatic catalysis. The introduced bioelectrode was applied to the conversion of bio&#8208;renewable platform materials, with glycerol as model substrate. The biocatalytic transformations of glycerol and 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) were investigated in a circular flow&#8208;through setup to assess the possibility of substrate over&#8208;oxidation, which is observed for glycerol oxidation but not during HMF conversion.

         <title>Photoswitching Affinity and Mechanism of Multivalent Lectin Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical cis&#8211;trans isomerization was used to switch a divalent lectin ligand between its two forms, which show contrasting binding properties to the plant lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), as visualized by the yin&#8208;yang symbol. Whereas the E isomer (obtained under irradiation with green light) is able to bridge adjacent binding sites of WGA leading to a high&#8208;affinity chelating binding mode, the Z isomer (obtained under UV light irradiation) crosslinks two lectin molecules associated with a much lower binding affinity. More information can be found in the Research Article by V. Wittmann and co&#8208;authors (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200267).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Analogues of N,N&#8208;dimethyladenine exploiting both thieno&#8208;and isothiazolo&#8208;pyrimidine cores were modified with 3&#8208;subsituted azetidines to yield visibly emissive and responsive fluorophores. Ribosylation of the difluoroazetidino&#8208;modified nucleobase yielded an emissive nucleoside that displayed a substantially lower emission quantum yield in water, compared to the precursor nucleobase. The impact of the sugar moiety on the photophysical features of fluorescent nucleosides, a functionality usually considered non&#8208;chromophoric and photophysically benign, was analyzed.







Abstract

The emission quantum yields, among the highest seen for purine analogues (0.64 and 0.77 in water and dioxane respectively), correlated with the Hammett inductive constants of the substituents on the azetidine ring. Ribosylation of the difluoroazetidino&#8208;modified nucleobase yielded an emissive nucleoside that displayed a substantially lower emission quantum yield in water, compared to the precursor nucleobase. Importantly, high emission quantum yield was restored in deuterium oxide, which highlights the potential impact of the sugar moiety on the photophysical features of fluorescent nucleosides, a functionality usually considered non&#8208;chromophoric and photophysically benign.

         <dc:description>Fluorene is a classic three&#8208;membered polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, and it has been widely used in optoelectronic devices. Here we explore a simple and efficient strategy for the derivatization at the 2&#8208; and 3&#8208; positions in fluorene unit. By introducing different types of substituents, we design two pairs of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted fluorene isomers and use them as host materials for phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (PHOLEDs). The green PHOLEDs hosted by these fluorene derivatives realize high external quantum efficiencies (EQE) over 20% with low efficiency roll&#8208;off. Particularly, the devices hosted by 2TRz3TPA and 2TPA3TRz achieve nearly 24% EQE and 104 lm W  &#8208;1  power efficiency. These results clearly demonstrate that the 2,3&#8208;disubstituted fluorene platforms are potentially useful for constructing host materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks: Functionalized construction strategy by nitrogen&#8208;containing functional group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework materials by intermolecular hydrogen bonding forces has been rapidly developed in the last decade, among which, the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding and functional binding sites exhibited by nitrogen&#8208;containing functional groups have made them favorites for designing organic components to customize functionalized porous materials. This review systematically introduces the types of nitrogen&#8208;containing monomers used to prepare porous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic backbones and the principles of their construction, summarizes the design advantages of crystalline materials from an elemental perspective, and presents the applications of such HOFs in the fields of gas adsorption/separation, molecular recognition, plasmonic conductivity, biomedical, and luminescent materials, etc. Finally, it discusses the prospects for the development of such materials and analyzes potential directions for future work.</dc:description>

         <title>Planarized Phenyldithienylboranes: Effects of the Bridging Moieties and&#160;&#960;&#8208;Extension on the Photophysical Properties and Lewis Acidity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two kinds of planarized phenyldithienylboranes, which contain (CH  3  )  2  C&#8208; or CH  2  bridging moieties, were synthesized. The difference of the bridging moieties affects their &#160; packing structures&#160;and photophysical properties. In particular, the&#160;(CH  3  )  2  C&#8208;bridged derivative exhibits a large Stokes shift, unusual for such planarized compounds, that results from&#160;a large&#160;structural relaxation in the excited state. A series of&#160;&#960;&#8208;extended derivatives was synthesized, among&#160;which a&#160;  p  &#8208;(diphenylamino)phenyl&#8208;substituted&#160;derivative shows&#160;large solvatochromism in the fluorescence spectra, while maintaining high quantum yields even in polar solvents. The Lewis acidity of the phenyldithienylborane derivatives was also assessed by titration with pyridine.&#160;The Lewis acidity of the&#160;boron center&#160;is affected not only by the difference in the steric bulk of the bridging moieties, but also by&#160;the electronic effect of the substituents introduced at remote positions relative to the boron atom. These results demonstrate the&#160;characteristic features of planarized&#160;phenyldithienylboranes as building blocks for boron&#8208;based&#160;&#960;&#8208;electron materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reaction of Zn(NO3)2&#183;6H2O, maleic acid (H2mal) and trans&#8208;4&#8208;(1&#8208;naphthylvinyl)pyridine (trans&#8208;nvp) in the dark results the formation of one&#8208;dimensional coordination polymer (1D CP) [Zn(mal)(trans&#8208;nvp)] (1), which is photosalient in nature. The crystals of 1 pop violently under UV light and moderately in sunlight, and generate cyclobutane ligand. However, the same reaction mixture kept in visible light exhibits rare example of in situ isomerization of both the ligands: cis&#8208;trans transformation of maleate and trans&#8208;cis isomerization of nvp ligands, and subsequent formation of another 1D CP [Zn(fum)(cis&#8208;nvp)2(H2O)2] (2, H2fum = fumaric acid), which is found to be photoinert. Thus, altering the reaction condition from dark to visible light gives rise to photosalient to photoinert crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Four&#8208;Component Ugi Reaction for Optical Chirality Sensing and Surface Nanoengineering of Chiral Self&#8208;Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using green chemistry to control chirality at hierarchical levels as well as chiroptical activities endows with new opportunities to the development of multiple functions. Here we introduce the four&#8208;component Ugi reaction for the general and precise optical chirality sensing of amines as well as the surface nanoengineering of chiral soft self&#8208;assemblies. To overcome the relatively weak Cotton effects, direct synthesis of folded peptide structure on a rotatable ferrocene core with axial chirality was accomplished from chiral amine, 1,1&#8217;&#8208;ferrocenyl dicarboxylic acid, formaldehyde and isocyanide. Enhanced Cotton effects benefiting from the folded structure allows for the precise and quantitative sensing of natural and synthetic chiral amines covering alkyl, aromatic amines and amino acid derivatives. In addition, aqueous reaction enables the modification of amine&#8208;bearing dye to microfibers self&#8208;assembled from &#960;&#8208;conjugated amino acids. Surface dye&#8208;modification  via  Ugi reaction barely varies the pristine morphology, showing non&#8208;invasive property in contrast to the dye staining, which is applicable in soft nano/microarchitectures from self&#8208;assembly. This work combines the four&#8208;component Ugi reaction to enable precise ee% detection and surface nanoengineering of soft chiral assemblies, sheds light on the advanced application of green chemistry to chirality science.</dc:description>

The development of such binder&#8208;free, self&#8208;supporting electrodes is of great significance for applications in electrocatalysis. In this work, a simple hydrothermal in situ self&#8208;assembly reaction and annealing process was developed to prepare three kinds of nickel oxide @ carbon felt (NiO@CF) nanocomposites with different morphologies. The influence of different precipitators (strong or weak bases) on the morphology of the resulting nano&#8208;sized nickel oxide nanocomposites was investigated. The microstructures of the NiO@CF samples were characterized with Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). When ammonia was used as the precipitator, NiO grew vertically on the surface of the carbon felt and formed a mesoporous nanosheet&#8208;like structure (NiO NSs@CF). As an electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (e&#8208;NRR) electrode, the NiO NSs@CF sample showed an excellent NH3 yield (71.3 &#956;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1cat.) and Faradaic efficiency (17.9% at &#8208;0.5 V vs RHE) in 0.1 M Na2SO4. The good performance was attributed to the vertical interleaved mesoporous sheet&#8208;like structure (with the pore size of 15 nm and the thickness of ~30 nm) and the relatively high concentration of oxygen vacancies. First&#8208;principle calculations with strong on&#8208;site Coulomb interactions demonstrated that the presence of oxygen vacancy on NiO sample leads to a significantly stronger N binding over the surface, benefiting for the nitrogen gas adsorption and reduction.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structure of an isolated Ag  +  (benzylamine) complex is investigated by infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy complemented with quantum chemical calculations of candidate geometries and their vibrational spectra, aiming to ascertain the role of competing cation&#8208;N and cation&#8208;&#960;&#160;interactions potentially offered by the polyfunctional ligand. The IRMPD spectrum has been recorded in the 800&#8208;1800 cm  &#8208;1  fingerprint range using the IR free electron laser beamline coupled with an FT&#8208;ICR mass spectrometer at the Centre Laser Infrarouge d&#8217;Orsay (CLIO).

         <title>Large Enhancement of the Single&#8208;Molecular Conductance of a Molecular Wire through a Radical Substituent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical solution: Single&#8208;molecular conductances were compared between methyl&#8208; and iminonitroxide&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;(biphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;yl)pyridine wires bound on porphyrin template by STM apparent height measurement. Statistical analysis of the STM images revealed that the radical&#8208;substituted wire has 3.2&#177;1.7&#8208;fold larger conductance than the methyl&#8208;substituted reference, despite the fact that only 17&#8201;% of the SOMO is calculated to be distributed on the wire moiety.







Abstract
The single&#8208;molecular conductance between two &#960;&#8208;conjugated wires with and without a radical substituent has been compared. Specifically, methyl&#8208; and iminonitroxide&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;(biphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;yl)pyridine wires bound onto a porphyrin template were subjected to scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) apparent&#8208;height measurement at the interface between highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and octan&#8208;1&#8208;oic acid. Statistical analysis of the STM images revealed that the radical&#8208;substituted wire has 3.2&#177;1.7&#8208;fold higher conductance than the methyl&#8208;substituted reference. Although density functional theory (DFT) calculation suggests that only 17&#8201;% of the SOMO is distributed on the wire moiety, the effect was significant. This study presents the potential of radical substituents to achieve high conductivity in molecular wires.

         <title>Design of Stimuli&#8208;responsive Phenthiazine Derivatives with Triplet&#8208;related Dual Emission and High&#8208;contrast Mechanochromism Guided by Polymorph Prediction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of high&#8208;contrast stimulus&#8208;responsive materials with excited triplet emission is of great significance for anti&#8208;counterfeiting, sensor and memory applications, but remains a challenge. Here, we report a strategy for rational design of stimulus&#8208;responsive phenothiazine derivatives with triplet&#8208;related dual emissions and high&#8208;contrast mechanochromism guided by Polymorph Prediction. The designed phenothiazine derivatives have the characters of simple structures, facile synthetic procedure and good crystalline nature. We found that the crystals of those derivatives with potential to form both quasi&#8208;axial (ax) and quasi&#8208;equatorial (eq) conformations could undergo conformation transition and show significant emission difference (&#916;&#955;em&gt; 100 nm) under mechanical force. Meanwhile, all these phenothiazine derivatives exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission character and emit room temperature phosphorescence or thermally activated delayed fluorescence. The significant luminescent change of these materials under different stimuli endows them promising applications in encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Multienzyme Biocatalytic Cascade Systems in Porous Organic Frameworks for Biosensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multienzyme biocatalytic cascade systems (MBCS) have attracted widespread research in the field of biosensing due to selective substrate transformations and signal amplification function. However, the poor stability of enzymes significantly restricts their effectiveness in practical applications. The spatial organization of MBCS within porous organic frameworks (POFs), such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, and hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks, is regarded as a promising strategy to overcome these challenges. This advanced biotechnology sets up a POFs microenvironment for enzymes immobilization, and thus enable to shield of the enzyme from the external stimulus by POFs&#8208;guided structural confinement. Simultaneously, the tailorable porous structure of POFs shell allows the selectivity transport of substrates into interior enzymes, thereby accelerating the sensing process. Herein, we present the concept of this POFs&#8208;confined MBCS, wherein enzymes were completed encapsulated into, rather than adsorption onto, the POFs. We highlight the new strategies for MBCS spatial organization through rational POFs support, and describe how this new bio&#8208;nanosystem that integrates framework and enzymes functions can be designed as a versatile biosensing platform. In addition, the challenges and outlooks are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular engineering of star&#8208;shaped indoline hole transport materials: The influence of planarity on the hole extraction and transport processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As the key properties of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the hole extraction and transport capabilities of the hole transport material (HTM) affect the photovoltaic performance of PSCs to considerable extent, while both capabilities can be adjusted by molecular planarity. Therefore, in this work, the molecular planarity of the HTM is systematically optimized to regulate the hole extraction and transport capabilities. Along with the improvement in planarity, the HTM's HOMO level is increased, leading to the enhancement of hole extraction capability. Meanwhile, the hole transport capability can also be improved due to the intensification of molecular stacking during the film formation. As a result, the planar HTM achieves a relatively high efficiency of 18.48%, which is higher than that of spiro  &#8208;OMeTAD. Accordingly, the molecular planarity presents an important impact on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, providing us a promising strategy for the further optimization of efficient HTMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Isolation of A Labile Silylated Hydrazinium&#8208;yl Radical Cation, [(Me3Si)2N&#8208;N(H)SiMe3]&#8226;+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxidation of silylated hydrazine, (Me3Si)2N&#8208;N(H)SiMe3, with silver salts led to the formation of a highly labile hydrazinium&#8208;yl radical cation, [(Me3Si)2N&#8208;N(H)SiMe3]&#8226;+, at very low temperatures (decomposition &gt; &#8211;40 &#176;C). EPR, NMR, DFT and Raman studies revealed the formation of a nitrogen&#8208;centered radical cation along the N&#8208;N unit of the hydrazine. In the presence of the weakly coordinating anion [Al{OCH(CF3)2}4]&#8211;, crystallization and structural characterization in the solid state were achieved. The hydrazinium&#8208;yl radical cation has a significantly shortened N&#8208;N bond and a nearly planar N2Si3 frame&#173;work in contrast to the starting material. According to DFT calculations, the shortened N&#8208;N bond has a total bond order of 1.5 with a &#960; bond order of 0.5. The &#960; bond can be regarded as a 3&#8208;&#960;&#8208;electron 2&#8208;center bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Size Effects of the Anions in the Ionothermal Synthesis of Carbon Nitride Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&lt;p class="Abstract"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN&#8208;US"&gt;Semiconducting carbon nitride polymers are used in metal&#8208;free photocatalysts and in opto&#8208;electronic devices. Conventionally, they are obtained using thermal and ionothermal syntheses in inscrutable, closed systems and therefore, their condensation behavior is poorly understood. Here, we compare the synthetic protocols and properties of two types of carbon nitride materials &amp;ndash; 2D layered poly(triazine imide) (PTI) and hydrogen&#8208;bonded melem hydrate &amp;ndash; obtained from three low&#8208;melting salt eutectics taken from the systematic series of the alkali metal halides: LiCl/KCl, LiBr/KBr, and LiI/KI. The size of the anion plays a significant role in the formation process of the condensed carbon nitride polymers, and it suggests a strong templating effect. The smaller anions (chloride and bromide) become incorporated into triazine (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&#8208;based PTI frameworks. The larger iodide does not stabilize the formation of a triazine&#8208;based polymer, but instead it leads to the formation of the heptazine (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded melem hydrate as the main crystalline phase. We obtain melem hydrate as single&#8208;crystalline powders and compare it with PTI in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water and in an OLED device. Further, we rationalize the emergence of each carbon nitride species from its corresponding salt eutectic &lt;italic&gt;&lt;span style="color:black"&gt;via&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/italic&gt;&lt;span style="color:black"&gt; density functional theory calculations. &lt;/span&gt;This study highlights the possibilities to further tailor the properties of eutectic salt melts for ionothermal synthesis of organic functional materials.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>

         <title>GNPS**&#8208;guided discovery of madurastatins A1, A2, E1, F, and G1, siderophores from the termite&#8208;associated Actinomadura sp. RB99</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we analyzed if  Actinomadura  sp. RB99 produces siderophores that that could be responsible for the antimicrobial activity observed in co&#8208;cultivation studies. Dereplication of high&#8208;resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HRMS/MS) and global natural product social molecular networking platform (GNPS) analysis of fungus&#8208;bacterium co&#8208;cultures resulted in the identification of five madurastatin derivatives (A1, A2, E1, F, and G1), of which were four new derivatives. Chemical structures were unambiguously confirmed by HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS, 1D and 2D NMR experiments, as well as MS/MS data and their absolute structures were elucidated based on Marfey&#8217;s analysis, DP4+ probability calculation and total synthesis. Structure analysis revealed that madurastatin E1 (  2  ) contained a rare 4&#8208;imidazolidinone cyclic moiety and madurastatin A1 (  5  ) was characterized as a Ga  3+  &#8208;complex. The function of madurastatins as siderophores was evaluated using the fungal pathogen  Cryptococcus neoformans  as model organism. Based on homology models, we identified the putative NRPS&#8208;based gene cluster region of the siderophores in  Actinomadura  sp. RB99.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial charge modulation via in&#8208;situ fabrication of 3D conductive platform with MOF nanoparticles for photocatalytic reduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly&#8208;efficient photocatalytic conversion of CO  2  into valuable carbon&#8208;contained chemicals possesses a tremendous potential in solving the energy crisis and global warming problem. However, the inadequate separation of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs and the unsatisfied capture of CO  2  stay the chief roadblocks. Herein, we designed a novel photocatalyst for CO  2  reduction by assembling three&#8208;dimensional graphene (3D GR) with a typical metal&#8208;organic framework material UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  , aiming to construct a built&#8208;in electric field for charge separation as well as taking advantage of the typical 3D structure of GR for maximizing the exposed absorption site on the surface. The performance evaluation demonstrated that the photocatalytic activity has been promoted for the composite materials than that of the pure UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  . Further mechanism investigations proved the enhanced photocatalytic performance is attributed to the synergy of enhanced CO  2  absorption and inhibited photogenerated charge recombination, which could be owing to the better distribution and exposure of absorption and reaction sites on composites, and the redistribution of photogenerated carriers between 3D GR and UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  , respectively. This study may furnish a promising pathway to probe nanocomposites based on MOFs in environmental improvement and other relevant fields.</dc:description>

combinatorial chemistry as a tool to graft amino acid side chains on a well&#8208;ordered 3D peptide backbone. Combining rationally designed scaffolds with combinatorial side chains selection represents an alternative method to access peptide libraries for structures that are not genetically encodable.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Copper Phthalocyanine Nanoparticles as Highly Sensitive Sensor for Colorimetric Detection of Biomarkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Though numerous nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like activities have been utilized as probes and sensors to detect biological molecules, it is still challenging to construct polymeric materials as highly sensitive detectors for biomarkers. Benefiting from the &#960;&#8208;d delocalization e&#64256;ect of electrons, excellent metal&#8208;chelating property, high electron transferability, and good chemical stability of &#960;&#8208;conjugated phthalocyanine, here, we report to design the copper phthalocyanine&#8208;based conjugated polymer nanoparticles (Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs) as a colorimetric sensor for a variety of biomarkers. The Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs are synthesized through a simple microwave&#8208;assisted polymerization, and their chemical structures are thoroughly characterized. The colorimetric results of Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs demonstrate excellent peroxidase&#8208;like detecting activity and also great substrate selectivity than most of the reported Cu&#8208;based nanomaterials. The Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs can achieve a detection limit of 4.88 &#956;M for the H  2  O  2  , 4.27 &#956;M for the L&#8208;cysteine, and 21.10 &#956;M for the glucose via a cascade catalytic system, which shows comparable detecting sensitivity as that of many earlier reported enzyme&#8208;like nanomaterials. Moreover, Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs present remarkable resistance to harsh conditions, including high temperature, low pH, excessive salts, etc. This highly specific &#960;&#8208;conjugated copper&#8208;phthalocyanine nanoparticle not only overcomes the current limitation of polymeric material&#8208;based sensors but also provides a new direction for designing next&#8208;generation enzyme&#8208;like nanomaterial&#8208;based colorimetric biosensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Dual Phosphorescence from (o&#8208;Bromophenyl)&#8208;Bis(2,6&#8208;Dimethylphenyl)Borane at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bromo&#8208;triarylborane o&#8208;BrTAB exhibits dual phosphorescence at room temperature; a short&#8208;lived higher energy emission originates from single molecules (T1M) whereas the long&#8208;lived component at lower energy results from an aggregate (T1A). Under 365&#8197;nm UV light irradiation, crystalline o&#8208;BrTAB emits bright pale blue light (fluorescence). After turning off the light, a persistent yellow afterglow remains for 2&#8197;s.







Abstract
Designing highly efficient purely organic phosphors at room temperature remains a challenge because of fast non&#8208;radiative processes and slow intersystem crossing (ISC) rates. The majority of them emit only single component phosphorescence. Herein, we have prepared 3 isomers (o, m, p&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl)boranes. Among the 3 isomers (o&#8208;, m&#8208; and p&#8208;BrTAB) synthesized, the ortho&#8208;one is the only one which shows dual phosphorescence, with a short lifetime of 0.8&#8197;ms and a long lifetime of 234&#8197;ms in the crystalline state at room temperature. Based on theoretical calculations and crystal structure analysis of o&#8208;BrTAB, the short lifetime component is ascribed to the T1M state of the monomer which emits the higher energy phosphorescence. The long&#8208;lived, lower energy phosphorescence emission is attributed to the T1A state of an aggregate, with multiple intermolecular interactions existing in crystalline o&#8208;BrTAB inhibiting nonradiative decay and stabilizing the triplet states efficiently.

         <title>Anomeric Stereoauxiliary Cleavage of the C&#8722;N Bond of d&#8208;Glucosamine for the Preparation of Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An &#945;&#8208;anomeric stereoauxiliary strategy for the targeted cleavage of C&#8722;N bonds in d&#8208;glucosamine was achieved through a seven&#8208;membered ring transition&#8208;state intermediate and the simultaneous incorporation of amine moieties in imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines. This method provides a novel strategy for the C&#8722;N bond cleavage and unlocks efficient access to diverse imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines blocks bearing versatile functional groups.







Abstract
The targeted cleavage of the C&#8722;N bonds of alkyl primary amines in sustainable compounds of biomass according to a metal&#8208;free pathway and the conjunction of nitrogen in the synthesis of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines are still highly challenging. Despite tremendous progress in the synthesis of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines over the past decade, many of them can still not be efficiently prepared. Herein, we report an anomeric stereoauxiliary approach for the synthesis of a wide range of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines after cleaving the C&#8722;N bond of d&#8208;glucosamine (&#945;&#8208;2&#176; amine) from biobased resources. This new approach expands the scope of readily accessible imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines relative to existing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods. A key strategic advantage of this approach is that the &#945;&#8208;anomer of d&#8208;glucosamine enables C&#8722;N bond cleavage via a seven&#8208;membered ring transition state. By using this novel method, a series of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives (&gt;80 examples) was synthesized from pyridine ketones (including para&#8208;dipyridine ketone) and aldehydes (including para&#8208;dialdehyde). Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives containing diverse important deuterated C(sp2)&#8722;H and C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds were also efficiently achieved.

         <title>Superassembled Hierarchical Asymmetric Magnetic Mesoporous Nanorobots Driven by Smart Confined Catalytic Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Set in motion: A hierarchical, asymmetric, magnetic, mesoporous, hollow nanorobot was constructed according to a sequential, interfacial superassembly strategy. This nanorobot integrated magnetic responsiveness, confined catalytic degradation, durable motion, recyclability into a single system; this not only sets a platform for manipulating its motion, but also provides a promising tool for various future applications.







Abstract
Micro/nanoscale robotics has received great attention in many important fields. However, it is still a great challenge to construct nanorobots simultaneously possessing multifunctionality, well&#8208;controlled directionality, and fast and durable motion as well as fully compatible and biodegradable components. Here, a hierarchical, asymmetric, hollow, catalytic, magnetic, and mesoporous nanorobot has been fabricated through a multistep interfacial superassembly strategy. The multilayer composites consist of hollow silica nanoflasks sequentially coated with a highly magnetic responsive Fe3O4 layer, a mesoporous silica layer with homogeneous vertical channels, and a layer of catalytic gold nanoparticles on both the inner and outer surfaces. Furthermore, para&#8208;nitrophenol was used as a model pollutant to trigger self&#8208;motility of the nanoflasks by confined catalytic degradation (CCD). We found that the bottleneck morphology and mesoporous surface both improved the catalytic nanoparticle loading capability and CCD effect, thus enabling efficient self&#8208;motility and a durable movement capacity of &#8764;100&#8197;h. In addition, the catalytic performance was improved by 180&#8201;% compared with that of solid spherical nanoparticles.

         <title>Zwitterionic Block Copolymers for the Synthesis and Stabilization of Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel synthesis of cesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) is enabled by replacing conventional small molecule ligands with zwitterion&#8208;containing block copolymers (BCPs) that are soluble in liquid phases useful for hot injection PNC syntheses. PNCs prepared in this manner are obtained in high yields with bright photoluminescence, with the zwitterionic BCPs facilitating efficient PNC isolation, long&#8208;term stability, and direct conversion to nanocomposite films.







Abstract
Traditional hot injection methods for the preparation of cesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (CsPbX3 PNCs, where X=Cl, Br, or I) rely on small molecule surfactants to produce PNCs with cube, plate, or rod&#8208;like morphologies. Here, we describe a new method whereby zwitterionic block copolymers are employed as macromolecular ligands in PNC synthesis, affording PNCs with excellent colloidal stability, high photoluminescence quantum yield, and in some cases distinctly non&#8208;cubic shapes. The block copolymers used in this study &#8211; composed of a poly(n&#8208;butyl methacrylate) hydrophobic block and zwitterionic methacrylate hydrophilic blocks &#8211; dissolve in useful solvents for PNC growth despite containing large mole percentages of zwitterionic groups. PNCs prepared with block copolymer ligands were found to disperse and retain their fluorescence in a range of polar organic solvents and were amenable to direct integration into optically transparent nanocomposite thin films with high PNC content.

         <title>Formation of an Azaruthenacyclopentadiene Skeleton via Ammonia Activation by an Electron&#8208;Deficient Ru3 Cluster</title>

A &#956;&#8208;amido complex was obtained by the reaction of a dicationic triruthenium complex containing a &#956;3&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;C3 ring with NH3. Subsequent treatment with base caused C&#8722;N bond formation, yielding a &#956;3&#8208;azaruthenacyclopentadienyl complex. The azaruthenacyclopentadiene skeleton was alternatively synthesized by the photolysis of a mono&#8208;cationic analogue in an NH3 atmosphere, in which the C3 ring skeleton was broken via the electron transfer to the &#960;*(C&#8722;C) orbital in the C3 ring

A dicationic triruthenium complex containing a &#956;3&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;C3 ring, [(Cp*Ru)3(&#956;3&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;C3MeH2&#8722;)(&#956;3&#8208;CH)(&#956;&#8208;H)]2+ (1&#8201;a, Cp*=&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5), reacted with ammonia to yield a &#956;&#8208;amido complex, [(Cp*Ru)3(&#956;3&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;CHCMeCH) (&#956;3&#8208;CH)(&#956;&#8208;NH2)]2+ (5), via N&#8722;H bond scission. Subsequent treatment with base resulted in C&#8722;N bond formation to yield a &#956;3&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;1&#8208;azabutadien&#8208;4&#8208;yl complex, [(Cp*Ru)3(&#956;3&#8208;CH)(&#956;3&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;NH=CH&#8722;CMe=CH&#8722;)]+ (6&#8201;a). The azaruthenacyclopentadiene skeleton was alternatively synthesized by the photolysis of mono&#8208;cationic complex [(Cp*Ru)3(&#956;3&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;C3RH2&#8722;)(&#956;3&#8208;CH)]+ (2&#8201;a; R=Me, 2&#8201;b; R=H) in the presence of ammonia. The C3 ring skeleton was broken via the electron transfer to the &#960;*(C&#8722;C) orbital in the C3 ring, and a transiently generated unsaturated &#956;3&#8208;allylic species can take up ammonia, resulting in N&#8722;H bond scission followed by C&#8722;N bond formation.

         <title>Optimization of an Asymmetric Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Held in place: Aromatic oligoamide sequences can regulate the stereochemistry of an asymmetric reaction in helical cavities. The modular construction design of the sequences confers the ease of sequential modification, whereby the diastereoselectivity of the asymmetric reaction significantly increases with diastereomeric excess from 9 to 90&#8201;% after a few progressive optimizations.







Abstract
An asymmetric reaction can be implemented and refined in the helical cavity of aromatic oligoamide sequences. These sequences, which bear a chiral inducer, can fold into helical structures with absolute control of the helical sense, whereby a ketone substrate covalently linked in the cavity can be asymmetrically reduced to diastereomers. The diastereoselectivity of the reduction is highly dependent on the shielding efficiency of the helical cavity. Iterative modifications of the sequence, such as addition and replacement of monomers, can fine&#8208;tune the cavity to realize the asymmetric reaction, thereby progressively increasing the diastereomeric excess up to 90&#8201;%.

         <title>The Influence of UiO&#8208;66 Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Structural Defects on Adsorption and Separation of Hexane Isomers</title>

The presence of structural defects in the crystal lattice of the microporous UiO&#8208;66 metal&#8211;organic framework affects the adsorption and separation of constitutional isomers of hexane. Experimental adsorption isobars were recreated using Monte Carlo molecular modelling in order to fully understand the observed phenomena at the molecular level.







Abstract
In this work, adsorption properties of the UiO&#8208;66 metal&#8211;organic framework were investigated, with particular emphasis on the influence of structural defects. A series of UiO&#8208;66 samples were synthesized and characterized using a wide range of experimental techniques. Type I adsorption isotherms for low&#8208;temperature adsorption of N2 and Ar showed that micropore volume and specific surface area significantly increase with the number of defects. Adsorption of hexane isomers in UiO&#8208;66 was studied by means of quasi&#8208;equilibrated temperature&#8208;programmed desorption and adsorption (QE&#8208;TPDA) experimental and Monte Carlo simulation techniques. QE&#8208;TPDA profiles revealed that only defect&#8208;free UiO&#8208;66 exhibits distinct two adsorption states. This technique also yielded high&#8208;quality adsorption isobars that were successfully recreated using Grand&#8208;Canonical Monte Carlo molecular simulations, which, however, required refinement of the existing force fields. The calculations demonstrated the detailed mechanism of adsorption and separation of hexane isomers in the UiO&#8208;66 structure. The preferred tetrahedral cages provide suitable voids for bulky molecules, which is the reason for unusual &#8220;reverse&#8221; selectivity of UiO&#8208;66 towards di&#8208;branched alkanes. Interconnection of the tetrahedral cavities due to missing organic linkers greatly reduces the selectivity of the defected material.

Crystal chameleons: Sterically frustrated aromatic enes (FAEs) composed of a 10&#8208;methyleneanthrone and two bulky aromatic rings contain a twisted C=C bond as well as a folded anthrone unit. Their solid&#8208;state energy landscapes show the presence of metastable intermediate crystals corresponding to conformations with different folds, twists and dihedral angles. Moreover, these FAE crystals have different absorption and emission colors from yellow to dark red that change in response to external stimuli, such as grinding, pressure, and heating.







Abstract
Overcrowded ethylenes composed of 10&#8208;methyleneanthrone and two bulky aromatic rings contain a twisted carbon&#8211;carbon double (C=C) bond as well as a folded anthrone unit. As such, they are unique frustrated aromatic enes (FAEs). Various colored crystals of these FAEs, obtained in different solvents, correspond to multiple metastable conformations of the FAEs with various twist and fold angles of the C=C bond, as well as various dihedral angles of attached aryl units with respect to the C=C bond. The relationships between color and these parameters associated with conformational features around the C=C bond were elucidated in experimental and computational studies. Owing to the fact that they are separated by small energy barriers, the variously colored conformations in the FAE crystal change in response to various external stimuli, such as mechanical grinding, hydrostatic pressure and thermal heating.

         <dc:description>A composite of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) GeSe  2  nanosheets dispersed on N&#8208;doped reduced graphene oxide (GeSe  2  /N&#8208;rGO) is fabricated via a simple hydrothermal method combined with post&#8208;selenization process. The high electronic conductivity and the substantial void spaces of the wrinkled N&#8208;rGO can improve the electrical conductivity of the active material and accommodate the volume evolution of GeSe  2  nanosheets during the (de)lithiation processes, while GeSe  2  nanosheets can reduce ion diffusion length effectively. Meanwhile, the unique layered structure is beneficial to the contact of the active material and electrolyte, and the reversibility of conversion reaction has also been improved. Furthermore, kinetics analysis reveals a pseudocapacitance&#8208;dominated Li  +  &#8208;storage mechanism at high rates.  In&#8208;situ  X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis discloses that the conversion reaction has played a certain part in Li  +  &#8208;storage. Thus, the GeSe  2  /N&#8208;rGO composite delivers excellent rate capability and good long&#8208;term stability with a high reversible capacity of 711.0 mA h g  &#8722;1  after 2000 cycles at 1 A g  &#8722;1  .</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure Reaction Profiles and Activation Volumes of 1,3&#8208;Cyclohexadiene Dimerizations Computed by the Extreme Pressure&#8208;Polarizable Continuum Model (XP&#8208;PCM)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
XP&#8208;PCM calculations on the thermal dimerizations of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene show that, going from the stepwise to the concerted [4+2] cycloaddition and finally to the concerted [6+4]&#8208;ene mechanisms, as the facial overlap between the rings increases in the transition state structure, the volume of the transition state decreases, leading to a more negative activation volume and increasing reaction acceleration under pressure.







Abstract
Quantum chemical calculations are reported for the thermal dimerizations of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene at 1&#8197;atm and high pressures up to the GPa range. Computed activation enthalpies of plausible dimerization pathways at 1&#8197;atm agree well with the experiment activation energies and the values from previous calculations. High&#8208;pressure reaction profiles, computed by the recently developed extreme pressure&#8208;polarizable continuum model (XP&#8208;PCM), show that the reduction of reaction barrier is more profound in concerted reactions than in stepwise reactions, which is rationalized on the basis of the volume profiles of different mechanisms. A clear shift of the transition state towards the reactant under pressure is revealed for the [6+4]&#8208;ene reaction by the calculations. The computed activation volumes by XP&#8208;PCM agree excellently with the experimental values, confirming the existence of competing mechanisms in the thermal dimerization of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene.

The corresponding enantiomers  2  S  &#8208;  4  S  have been obtained from  1  S  containing (  S,S  )&#8208;Skewphos. Reaction of  2  R  and  2  S  with (  S  )&#8208;cysteine and NaPF  6  at pH = 9 gives the diastereoisomers [Ru((  S  )&#8208;Cys)(CO)(PP)(phen)]PF  6  (PP = (  R,R  )&#8208;Skewphos  2  R  &#8208;Cys; (  S,S  )&#8208;Skewphos  2  S  &#8208;Cys). The DFT energetic profile for  2  R  with (  S  )&#8208;cysteine in H  2  O indicates that aquo and hydroxo species are involved in formation of  2  R  &#8208;Cys. The stability of the ruthenium complexes in 0.9% w/v NaCl solution, PBS and complete DMEM medium, as well as their  n  &#8208;octanol/water partition coefficient (logP), have been evaluated. The chiral complexes show high cytotoxic activity against SW1736, 8505C, HCT&#8208;116 and A549 cell lines with EC  50  values of 2.8&#8208;0.04  &#181;  M. The (  R  ,  R  )&#8208;Skewphos derivatives show higher cytotoxicity compared to their enantiomers,  4  R  (EC  50  = 0.04  &#181;  M) being 14 times more cytotoxic than  4  S  against the anaplastic thyroid cancer 8505C cell line.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;pot Approach for Bio&#8208;based Arylamines via a Combined Photooxidative Dearomatization&#8208;Rearomatization Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of arylamines from renewable resources under mild reaction conditions is highly desired for the sustainability of the chemical industry, where the production of hazardous waste is a prime concern. However, to date, there are very few tools in chemists&#8217; toolboxes that are able to produce arylamines in a sustainable manner. Herein, a robust one&#8208;pot approach for constructing bio&#8208;based arylamines via a combined photooxidative dearomatization&#8208;rearomatization strategy is presented. The developed methodology enables the synthesis of structurally complex amines in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good isolated yields using biomass&#8208;derived phenols, natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids, and naphthols under remarkably mild reaction conditions. For the photooxygenation of phenols, a novel chrysazine&#8208;based catalyst system was introduced, demonstrating its efficiency for the synthesis of natural products &#8211; hallerone and rengyolone and the pharmaceutically relevant prodrug DHED.</dc:description>

         <title>Isomorphic Fluorescent Nucleosides Facilitate a Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of RNA Depurination by Ribosome Inactivating Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ribosome&#8208;inactivating proteins, a family of highly cytotoxic proteins  , interfere with protein synthesis by depurinating a specific adenosine residue within the conserved  &#945;&#8208;sarcin/ricin loop  of eukaryotic ribosomal RNA. Besides being biological warfare agents, certain RIPs have been promoted as potential therapeutic tools.&#160; Monitoring their deglycosylation activity and its inhibition in real time has remained, however, elusive. Herein, we describe the enzymatic preparation and utility of consensus RIP hairpin substrates in which specific G residues, neighboring the depurination site, are surgically replaced with  tz  G and  th  G, fluorescent G analogs. By strategically modifying key positions with responsive fluorescent surrogate nucleotides, RIP&#8208;mediated depurination can be monitored in real&#8208;time by steady state fluorescence spectroscopy. Subtle differences observed in preferential depurination sites provide insight into the RNA folding as well as RIPs&#8217; substrate recognition features.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporation of redox&#8208;inactive metals into redox&#8208;active complexes and catalysts attracts attention for engendering new reactivity modes, but this strategy has not been extensively investigated beyond the first&#8208;row of the transition metals. Here, the isolation and characterization of the first series of heterobimetallic complexes of palladium with mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;valent redox&#8208;inactive metal ions are reported. A Reinhoudt&#8208;type heteroditopic ligand with a salen&#8208;derived [  N  2  ,  O  2  ] binding site for Pd and a crown&#8208;ether&#8208;derived [  O  6  ] site has been used to prepare isolable adducts of the Lewis acidic redox&#8208;inactive metal ions (  M  n+  ). Comprehensive data from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveal distinctive trends in the structural properties of the heterobimetallic species, including an uncommon dependence of the Pd&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;  M  distance on Lewis acidity. The reorganization energy associated with reduction of the heterobimetallic species is strongly modulated by Lewis acidity, with the slowest heterogeneous electron transfer kinetics associated with the strongest incorporated Lewis acids. This hitherto unexplored reorganization energy penalty for electron transfer contrasts with prior thermodynamic studies, revealing that kinetic parameters should be considered in studies of reactivity involving heterobimetallic species.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction: from Discrete Molecular Catalysts to Their Integrated Catalytic Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the recent developments in design principles, structural tuning and integration strategies of molecular catalysts for electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 and provides a perspective on their future challenges and opportunities.







Abstract
Molecular catalysts (metal complexes), with molecularly defined uniform active sites and atomically precise structural tailorability allowing for regulating catalytic performance through metal&#8208; and ligand&#8208;centered engineering and elucidating reaction mechanisms via routine photoelectrochemical characterizations, have been increasingly explored for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR). However, their poor stability and low catalytic current density are undesirable for practical applications. Heterogenizing discrete molecular catalysts can potentially surmount these issues, and the resulting integrated catalysts largely share catalytical properties with their discrete molecular counterparts, which bridge the gap between heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis and combine their advantages. This minireview surveys advances in design and regulation of molecular catalysts such as porphyrin, phthalocyanine, and bipyridine&#8208;based metal complexes and their integrated catalytic materials for selective ECR.

         <title>Homogeneous&#8208;to&#8208;Heterogeneous&#8208;Strategy Enables Multifunctional Phase&#8208;Change Materials for Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homogenous&#8208;to&#8208;heterogenous&#8208;strategy was raised as a concept to enable the fabrication of multifunctional phase change materials (PCMs). The as&#8208;prepared PCM was endowed with enhanced thermal performance, shape flexibility, and organic pollutant removing function. This novel strategy is expected to be one of universal PCMs encapsulation method.







Abstract
Functional phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) are conspicuously absent in various organic or inorganic solids with diversified applications in which the attributes of these molecular materials have been highly realized. Leakage problem during the phase transition process is the main obstacle on the way of widely use of solid&#8208;liquid PCMs who has been recognized to be promisingly practical candidates for energy storage owing to the high energy storage density and small volume change in the phase transition process. Herein, a novel homogeneous&#8208;to&#8208;heterogeneous&#8208;strategy, in which all the starting materials involved display a homogeneous state and the encapsulation framework formed in&#8197;situ in the encapsulation process, enabled by an aerogel reaction of silica was realized under the catalysis of an organic base. Besides the comprehensive study upon energy storage performance, light&#8208;to&#8208;thermal conversion and recyclability performance study of the obtained materials reveal the clear superiority over pristine paraffin wax (PW) thanks to the versatility and robustness of this fabrication method. More importantly, the homogeneous&#8208;to&#8208;heterogeneous&#8208;strategy endows a unique adsorption ability with respect to organic pollutant due to the PCMs inside and therefore bearing a great potential to be used in environment protection fields.

         <dc:description>
Design of efficient catalysts is crucial for achieving highly efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction. In this review, the recent advances in design and preparation of the catalysts by electrodeposition and their applications in electrochemical CO2 reduction are highlighted. Various types of electro&#8208;synthesized catalysts are described. The problems and solutions of current electro&#8208;synthesized catalysts for CO2 reduction are also proposed.







Abstract
With the increasing emission of carbon dioxide (CO2), the conversion and utilization of CO2 have become a topic of increasing concern. Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an attractive and sustainable approach for solving energy and environmental problems. Design of efficient catalysts is crucial for achieving highly efficient CO2RR. Different methods to prepare catalysts have been reported and used. Among them, electrodeposition is one of the common approaches, which has some obvious advantages, such as requiring simple equipment, environmentally benign. Especially, it can direct deposit catalysts on different substrates to prepare electrodes for CO2RR. In this review, we discuss recent advances in design and preparation of the catalysts by electrodeposition and their applications in CO2RR. Furthermore, the perspective of this promising area is also discussed.

         <title>Highly Deep&#8208;Blue Luminescent Twisted Diphenylamino Terphenyl Emitters by Bromine&#8208;Lithium Exchange Borylation&#8208;Suzuki Sequence</title>

Shining in deep blue: Four highly luminescent emitters can be obtained by a bromine&#8208;lithium exchange borylation&#8208;Suzuki (BLEBS) sequence in a one&#8208;pot fashion. Photophysical properties, such as deep&#8208;blue emission with high quantum yields in different surroundings, make this class of functional chromophores attractive for applications.







Abstract
Four novel intensively blue luminescent chromophores were readily synthesized by bromine&#8208;lithium exchange borylation&#8208;Suzuki (BLEBS) sequence in moderate to good yields. Their electronic properties were studied by absorption and emission spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations revealing deep&#8208;blue emission in solution as well as in the solid state and upon embedding into a PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate) matrix with small FWHM (full width at half maximum) values and CIE y values smaller than 0.1. Moreover, high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY), partially close to unity, are found.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four novel intensively blue luminescent chromophores were readily synthesized by bromine-lithium exchange borylation-Suzuki (BLEBS) sequence in moderate to good yields. Their electronic properties were studied by absorption and emission spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations revealing deep-blue emission in solution as well as in the solid state and upon embedding into a PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate) matrix with small FWHM (full width at half maximum) values and CIE y values smaller than 0.1. Moreover, high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY), partially close to unity, are found.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Csp2&#8722;OMe Functionalization for Chemoselective Aromatic Homologation En Route to Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni(0)&#8208;catalyzed methodology efficiently achieves Csp2&#8722;OMe functionalization in the presence of internal alkynes, forming chemoselectively either aromatic homologation or intramolecular monoannulation products. Furthermore, aromatic homologation products are proven as valid precursors for further diversification towards nanographene&#8208;like synthesis.







Abstract
A Ni&#8208;catalyzed Csp2&#8722;OMe ortho&#8208;functionalization methodology to form chemoselectively alkyne monoannulation or aromatic homologation products is reported as a novel protocol towards the valorisation of substrates containing Csp2&#8722;OMe units. Double activation of Csp2&#8722;OMe and Csp2&#8722;F bonds is also demonstrated. Further use of aromatic homologation products towards the synthesis of nanographene&#8208;like compounds is described.

         <title>Diarylcuprates for Selective Syntheses of Multifunctionalized Ketones from Thioesters under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of ketone as a synthetic intermediate of canagliflozin from a gluconolactone&#8208;derived thioester and a Grignard reagent with the aid of copper is likened to making Taiyaki, a Japanese fish&#8208;shaped waffle with sweet red bean inside. The thioester (sweet red beans) and the Grignard reagent (waffle batter) are baked on a copper waffle iron to get the desired ketone as Taiyaki. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Tsurugi, M. Seki, K. Mashima, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200474).

         <title>Catalytic Reduction of Dinitrogen into Ammonia and Hydrazine by Using Chromium Complexes Bearing PCP&#8208;Type Pincer Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of chromium complexes bearing a carbene&#8208; and phosphine&#8208;based PCP&#8208;type pincer ligand has been newly prepared, and some of them are found to work as effective catalysts to reduce dinitrogen into ammonia and hydrazine under atmospheric pressure. This reaction can be expressed as nitrogen molecules (raindrops) being converted into ammonia and hydrazine on the chromium complex (umbrella). More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Yoshizawa, Y. Nishibayashi et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200557).

         <title>Boron&#8208;Locked Starazine &#8211; A Soluble and Fluorescent Analogue of Starphene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first counterpart of starphene, namely starazine, that contains a nonaaza&#8208;core structure and three peripheral isoquinoline units locked by three tetracoordinate borons to form a quasi&#8208;planar backbone is described. This starazine possesses a non&#8208;aromatic and electron&#8208;deficient core due to the introduction of the heteroatoms replacing the corresponding carbon atoms in starphene. The transition to its lowest excited state is allowed, sharply contrasting to the starphenes, endowing fluorescent properties to this novel starlike dye molecule.







Abstract
A starlike heterocyclic molecule containing an electron&#8208;deficient nonaaza&#8208;core structure and three peripheral isoquinolines locked by three tetracoordinate borons, namely isoquinoline&#8208;nona&#8208;starazine (QNSA), is synthesized by using readily available reactants through a rather straightforward approach. This new heteroatom&#8208;rich QNSA possesses a quasi&#8208;planar &#960;&#8208;backbone structure, and bears phenyl substituents on borons which protrude on both sides of the &#960;&#8208;backbones endowing it with good solubility in common organic solvents. Contrasting to its starphene analogue, QNSA shows intense fluorescence with a quantum yield (PLQY) of up to 62&#8201;% in dilute solution.
