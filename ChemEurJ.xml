         <title>Air&#8208;Stable 2,2&#8242;&#8208;Azobispyridine Radical&#8211;Boron Complexes and Their Near&#8208;Infrared Absorption Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Air&#8208;stable 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobispyridine radical&#8211;boron complexes were synthesized via one&#8208;electron oxidation of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;hydrazobispyridine precursors. The bulky and electron&#8208;withdrawing B(C6F5)2 group effectively stabilized the radicals. ESR and DFT studies confirmed spin&#8208;delocalization over the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobispyridine &#960;&#8208;framework and N&#9472;N bond contraction upon oxidation. These radical complexes exhibited near&#8208;infrared absorption.








ABSTRACT
Air&#8208;stable nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals are of great interest as building blocks for functional molecular materials. In this study, we developed 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobispyridine radical&#8211;boron complexes that exhibit near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption. The complexes were synthesized by introducing boron substituents into 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobispyridine frameworks, followed by one&#8208;electron oxidation to generate the corresponding radical species. The B(C6F5)2 derivatives were successfully isolated as air&#8208; and water&#8208;stable solids, whereas the BF2 and B(n&#8208;Bu)2 analogues could not be obtained. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy revealed broad isotropic signals with g &#8776; 2.00, indicating that the unpaired electron is delocalized over the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobispyridine core. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported this delocalization and reproduced the observed structural changes, including a N&#9472;N bond shortening upon oxidation. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of the methoxy&#8208;substituted complex confirmed these structural features. The radical complexes displayed NIR absorption with &#955;max values of 800&#8211;1140&#160;nm, depending on the substituents. These findings demonstrate that boron complexation effectively stabilizes 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobispyridine radicals and enables precise tuning of their optical properties, providing a promising design principle for NIR functional dyes and radical&#8208;based materials.

         <title>A Tandem Chemical Vapor Deposition Platform for the Solvent&#8208;Free Synthesis of Polypeptide Architectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;free, two&#8208;step chemical vapor polymerization enables efficient, substrate&#8208;independent synthesis of surface&#8208;attached polypeptide films. Initiator deposition via CVD is followed by NCA ring&#8208;opening polymerization. Characterization confirms film formation and functionalization, allowing precise micropatterning and bioactive surface design for biomedical and industrial applications.








ABSTRACT
The precise engineering of surfaces decorated with polypeptides is critical for advanced diagnostics, biomedical coatings, and cellular interfaces. However, conventional methods are plagued by the need for solvents, multistep procedures, substrate limitations, and the abundance of side reactions. Here, we report that two&#8208;step chemical vapor polymerization can result in the fast, efficient, and substrate&#8208;independent synthesis of polypeptide films without the use of solvents or excipients. The first step involves deposition of an initiator layer, i.e., poly(4&#8208;amino&#8208;p&#8208;xylylene), via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) polymerization of 4,16&#8208;diamino[2.2]paracyclophane. The second step involves evaporation and ring&#8208;opening polymerization of N&#8208;carboxy anhydrides. This fully integrated CVD approach ensures substrate&#8208;independent, conformal growth of poly(propargyl&#8208;(S)&#8208;glycine) and poly(O&#8208;propargyl&#8208;(S)&#8208;tyrosine) films of up to 198&#160;nm thickness. The use of CVD processes eliminates the concern of side reactions, such as transfer and termination reactions, and is a prerequisite for the successful peptide micropatterning, demonstrated in this study. Successful peptide growth and post&#8208;polymerization modifications via click chemistry were confirmed by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary mass spectrometry, x&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy. The application of entirely solvent&#8208;free workflows to develop biomacromolecular coatings, such as the polypeptide films demonstrated in this study, addresses a critical gap in the pursuit of advanced and scalable biologization methods.

         <title>Upconversion Luminescence of Molecular Lanthanide Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent advances in upconversion lanthanide complexes varying from structural design to luminescent properties. They are classified into mononuclear lanthanide complexes, ion&#8208;paired lanthanide complexes and polynuclear lanthanide complexes, according to the structural characteristics.








ABSTRACT
Upconversion luminescence (UCL) materials based on the molecular lanthanide complexes have garnered increasing attention in diverse frontier fields in recent years. Compared with the intensively investigated lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), the development of UCL lanthanide complexes needs strengthening, especially considering the controllable synthesis and flexible architecture characteristics of lanthanide complexes. In this review, we overview the recent advances in UCL lanthanide complex, varying from structural design to luminescent properties. The challenges remaining and future prospects for UCL lanthanide complex are also discussed. We hope that the review will bring more inspirations and possibilities for developing the field of molecular UCL.

         <title>Synergistic Sm,Fe Co&#8208;Doping in NiO Nanoparticles on Carbon Nanofibers Boosts Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sm,Fe co&#8208;doped NiO nanoparticles anchored on interconnected carbon nanofibers (Sm,Fe&#8208;NiO/CNFs) were developed to synergistically enhance OER activity and stability through Sm&#8208;induced electronic state engineering and oxygen vacancy engineering.








ABSTRACT
Nickel oxide (NiO) electrocatalysts suffer from inevitable oxidative degradation during alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER), where irreversible phase transitions compromise structural integrity and long&#8208;term stability. Herein, the Sm,Fe co&#8208;doped NiO nanoparticles anchored on interconnected carbon nanofibers (denoted as Sm,Fe&#8208;NiO/CNFs) was proposed as highly efficient and stable OER catalyst. By employing rare earth (RE) Sm doping to stabilize low&#8208;valence Ni sites and generate oxygen vacancies (VO) through charge compensation, the Sm,Fe&#8208;NiO/CNFs exhibits exceptional OER activity, with a low overpotential of only 274&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, which is superior to that of Fe&#8208;NiO/CNFs (280&#160;mV) and RuO2 (333&#160;mV). Besides, Sm,Fe&#8208;NiO/CNFs also has robust long&#8208;term stability and satisfying selectivity (nearly 100% Faradic efficiency). Using Sm,Fe&#8208;NiO/CNFs as the anode in a water&#8208;splitting electrolyzer, it operates at a low potential of just 1.51&#160;V to achieve 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, making it a promising candidate for water splitting applications. It was discovered that Sm doping offers electron donation to Ni active sites in Fe&#8208;NiO to stabilize the Ni&#9472;O bonds, preventing over&#8208;oxidation and dissolution of metal species, and thus contributing to the significantly improved OER activity and long&#8208;term stability of the catalyst.

         <title>AgBF4&#8208;Induced Site&#8208;Selective Synthesis of 4&#8208;Sulfonylindoles in Au&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization&#8208;Sulfonyl Migration Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Site&#8208;selective synthesis 4&#8208;suflonylindoles was achieved by a cyclization&#8208;rearrangement strategy by &#960;&#8208;Lewis acidic gold catalysts and the aid of silver cocatalyst. Particularly, the use of 3 equivalents of AgBF4 to SPhosAuCl is crucial for C4&#8208;selective migration of the sulfonyl group.








ABSTRACT
The reactions of ortho&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;N&#8208;arenesulfonylanilines in the presence of SPhosAuCl (2&#160;mol %) and AgBF4 (6&#160;mol %) produced the corresponding 4&#8208;sulfonylindoles in good yields with satisfactory site&#8208;selectivity at the C4&#8208;position of the indole ring. This reaction proceeded via cyclization followed by sequential [1,2]&#8208;rearrangement of the sulfonyl group. The selective migration of the sulfonyl group to the C4&#8208;position was induced by using an excess amount of AgBF4 relative to the gold catalyst to form a dinuclear Au&#9472;Ag complex to decelerate the migration to C3&#8208;position. Furthermore, the tetrafluoroborate anion with its suitable gold affinity and hydrogen bonding characteristics, plays a crucial role in enabling selective migration to the C4&#8208;position.

         <title>Polydopamine&#8208;Mediated Grafting of Cationic Polymer Brushes for Adsorption of Fluorinated Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a versatile approach to fabricate tunable charged interfaces by functionalizing stonewool fibers with a polydopamine (PDA)&#8211;quaternary amine coating via a grafting&#8208;to method. The modified surfaces exhibit rapid, concentration&#8208;dependent adsorption of anionic species driven by electrostatic interactions.








ABSTRACT
Understanding the adsorption behavior of charged molecular species at functionalized polymer interfaces is critical for advancing surface science and material design. Building upon recent advances in polydopamine (PDA)&#8208;mediated polymer grafting, we investigated electrostatic adsorption at cationic polymer brush surfaces. Using a grafting&#8208;to approach, we covalently attached poly(2&#8208;trimethylammonioethyl methacrylate chloride) (PTMAEMA) to PDA&#8208;coated stonewool fibers and characterized the resulting charged interface via x&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). We employed perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) as a model anionic adsorbate to investigate binding at a quaternary amine&#8208;functionalized surface. Batch equilibrium sorption studies revealed concentration&#8208;dependent adsorption kinetics, achieving three times higher binding affinity for PTMAEMA&#8208;functionalized fibers at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 5.0&#160;g&#160;L&#8722;1, with equilibrium reached within 10 min. XPS analysis confirmed the successful surface functionalization with distinct nitrogen environments at 395.5&#160;eV (PDA) and 398.5&#160;eV (quaternary nitrogen), while thermogravimetric data indicated an organic loading of close to 28%. Our findings demonstrate that PDA&#8208;mediated polymer grafting provides a versatile platform for creating well&#8208;defined charged interfaces with tunable adsorption characteristics, and provides a methodology to explore fundamental adsorption phenomena at polymer&#8208;liquid interfaces.

         <title>Synthesis and Self&#8208;Assembly of Perylene Imide&#8208;Containing Hydrophilic Polymers in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores recent advances in the synthesis and design of perylene imide&#8208;functionalized hydrophilic polymers and their self&#8208;assembly in aqueous media. We highlight how molecular and supramolecular engineering drive the formation of functional, water&#8208;borne nanostructures, and identify the remaining challenges, which limit currently their broader application.








ABSTRACT
New advances in synthetic strategies have greatly expanded the structural diversity of perylene imides (PIs), increasing the tunability of their molecular properties and assemblies in organic solvents. More recent studies also show molecular assemblies in aqueous media when the hydrophobic perylene core is functionalized with hydrophilic groups, allowing their use not only in optoelectronics or catalysis, but also in biological applications. However, PIs are usually too hydrophobic to be used in water, and their molecular assemblies usually result in ill&#8208;defined nanostructures with a significant loss of their emissive properties. Therefore, a powerful and promising strategy to enhance PI solubility in water is to incorporate them into hydrophilic polymer chains. Compared to small hydrophilic groups, the length and architecture of the polymer can be controlled and adapted to modulate the nanostructure morphology while preserving the perylene's properties in water. This review summarizes the current literature on the self&#8208;assembly in water of PI&#8208;based hydrophilic polymers, with a focus on their synthesis and the different parameters that influence the self&#8208;assembly and properties of the materials.

         <title>Conformation&#8208;Variable [7]Annulenyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[7]Annulenyl radicals exhibit substituent&#8208;dependent conformations, affecting different spin distribution and chemo&#8208;stability. The dibenzo&#8208; analogues show more planar geometry and longer persistency than the tribenzo&#8208; variants due to more effective &#960;&#8208;conjugation.








ABSTRACT
A series of benzo&#8208;fused [7]annulenyl radical derivatives are synthesized and studied. By comparing their spin distribution differences revealed by EPR, variable molecular structures adaptive to steric features around the [7]annulenyl moiety are unveiled. Specifically, for radicals having no substituent on the vinylene carbons (C10 &amp; C11), a relatively planar dibenzo[a,d][7]annulenyl skeleton containing a delocalized spin is suggested by both experimental data and computation results. Depending on the substituting group on C5, decent to optimal persistency is observed, as represented by a half lifetime of 23&#160;h displayed by a triisopropylphenyl&#8208;substituted radical in air&#8208;saturated solution. When a substituent is added to C10, the radical stability can be further improved, although the [7]annulenyl framework becomes slightly bended. However, the tribenzo[a,c,e][7]annulenyl radicals exhibit noticeably inferior stability attributed to the nonplanar conformation assumed by the tetracyclic scaffold, which not only curbs the spin delocalization by disrupting the &#960;&#8208;conjugation, but also makes the molecule more susceptible to various spin&#8208;annihilation reactions. More interestingly, when an anthryl group is attached to C9 of tribenzo[a,c,e][7]annulenyl, a pronounced conformational transition to folded state is observed, with the spin concurrently relocated from the tribenzo[7]annulenyl moiety to 9,10&#8208;anthrylene unit, presumably driven by the superior spin delocalization property.

         <title>Study on the Directional Synthesis of Bi2S3 Induced by Graphene and the Mechanism of Pseudocapacitive Kinetics Regulation at the Interface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









ABSTRACT
To address the issues of capacity decay and poor rate performance of Bi2S3 anode materials, which are caused by their intrinsically low conductivity and significant volume expansion during cycling, this study adopts a redox self&#8208;assembly strategy. Under mild hydrothermal conditions, oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups on the surface of graphene oxide (GO) induce the directed growth of Bi2S3 along the [001] crystallographic direction, successfully constructing a Bi2S3/GO composite anode with strong interfacial coupling. This structure effectively suppresses the agglomeration of Bi2S3 nanorods, forms a 3D conductive network, alleviates volume strain, and avoids structural damage caused by traditional high&#8208;temperature sulfidation processes. Electrochemical tests show that the 1.0&#8208;Bi2S3/GO composite retains a capacity of 300 mAh&#183;g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 100 mA&#183;g&#8722;1. At a high rate of 5000 mA&#183;g&#8722;1, it still exhibits a reversible capacity of 198.62 mAh&#183;g&#8722;1, and after current recovery, the capacity rapidly increases to 439 mAh&#183;g&#8722;1, with a capacity retention rate exceeding 70%. The lithium&#8208;ion diffusion coefficient reaches 8.7&#215;10&#8722;12 cm2&#183;s&#8722;1, which is 2.8 times higher than that of the pure phase. Mechanistic analysis reveals that the characteristic peak (&#964; = 0.3 s) in the distribution relaxation time (DRT) relaxation spectrum corresponds to the pseudocapacitive behavior on the GO surface, with a contribution rate of 58% at a scan rate of 2 mV&#183;s&#8722;1, significantly optimizing the ion storage dynamics at the interface. Additionally, the built&#8208;in electric field at the interface facilitates charge transfer, effectively shortening the relaxation time. The synergistic &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking buffering network further enhances structural stability and reaction reversibility. This study, through the &#8220;directed growth&#8208;pseudocapacitance regulation&#8208;relaxation matching&#8221; triple mechanism, provides new insights for the design of high&#8208;performance sulfide&#8208;based anodes.

Electrochemical tests show that the 1.0-Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/GO composite retains a capacity of 300 mAh&#183;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 100 cycles at a current density of 100 mA&#183;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. At a high rate of 5000 mA&#183;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, it still exhibits a reversible capacity of 198.62 mAh&#183;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and after current recovery, the capacity rapidly increases to 439 mAh&#183;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, with a capacity retention rate exceeding 70%. The lithium-ion diffusion coefficient reaches 8.7&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is 2.8 times higher than that of the pure phase. Mechanistic analysis reveals that the characteristic peak (&#964; = 0.3 s) in the distribution relaxation time (DRT) relaxation spectrum corresponds to the pseudocapacitive behavior on the GO surface, with a contribution rate of 58% at a scan rate of 2 mV&#183;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, significantly optimizing the ion storage dynamics at the interface. Additionally, the built-in electric field at the interface facilitates charge transfer, effectively shortening the relaxation time. The synergistic &#960;-&#960; stacking buffering network further enhances structural stability and reaction reversibility. This study, through the &#8220;directed growth-pseudocapacitance regulation-relaxation matching&#8221; triple mechanism, provides new insights for the design of high-performance sulfide-based anodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>SmI2/Sm&#8208;Induced Reductive Silacyclization of Alkene/Diene Derivatives Using Dichlorosilanes or 1,2&#8208;Dichlorodisilanes via Reductive Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A SmI2/Sm&#8208;mediated silacyclization unlocks a concise route to 4&#8211;7&#8208;membered silacycles from simple unsaturated substrates and dichlorosilanes/disilanes. The complementary functions of samarium reductants trigger a reductive radical&#8211;polar crossover, offering a versatile strategy for constructing multiple Si&#9472;C bonds efficiently.








ABSTRACT
The development of efficient strategies for constructing cyclic organosilicon frameworks is considered of great importance because of their structural diversity and synthetic utility. Herein, we report a SmI2/Sm&#8208;mediated silacyclization of unsaturated organic compounds with readily available dichlorosilanes and &#8208;disilanes, enabling convenient access to 4&#8722;7&#8208;membered silacyclic compounds. Mechanistic investigations indicate that the reaction involves silyl radical intermediates and proceeds via a reductive radical&#8208;polar crossover (RRPCO) pathway. The present findings showcase the broad potential of Sm reagents in Si&#9472;C bond formation, providing a versatile strategy for constructing diverse silicon&#8208;containing frameworks.

         <title>Evolution of the Total Synthesis of Gregatin A and Related Natural Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From deceptively simple monomers to architecturally complex dimers, this review traces the evolution of synthetic strategies to gregatin A and its dimeric congeners. Advances in asymmetric and biomimetic synthesis reveal how modern tactics unravel the structure, reactivity, and biosynthetic logic of this fungal polyketide family.








ABSTRACT
The gregatins constitute a distinctive family of fungal metabolites exhibiting notable phytotoxic and antimicrobial activities, which have attracted sustained interest from the synthetic community since their discovery. Despite their deceptively simple molecular architectures, the structural elucidation and asymmetric synthesis of gregatins have long remained challenging. Among them, gregatin A serves as the prototypical member and a proposed biosynthetic precursor to several dimeric congeners, including penicilfuranone A, asperones A and B, and citrifurans A and D. Over the past decades, remarkable progress has been achieved in the total and asymmetric synthesis of these compounds, reflecting the continuous evolution of synthetic strategies toward greater efficiency, selectivity, and biomimetic relevance. This review summarizes the methodological innovations and strategic advances that have shaped the total synthesis of gregatin A and its structurally related dimers, highlighting the broader conceptual evolution of asymmetric synthesis in complex natural product chemistry.

         <title>Induced&#8208;Fit Recognition by a Calixarene&#8211;Pyrene Conjugate for Single&#8208; and Dual&#8208;Wavelength Fluorescence Sensing in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfonatocalix[4]arene&#8211;pyrene conjugate functions as a fluorescence chemosensor for the optical detection of biorelevant analytes in water. Its photoinduced electron transfer (PET) response is triggered by an induced&#8208;fit recognition mechanism. Noncovalent assembly with an additional dye affords dual&#8208;color ratiometric signaling via competitive PET.








ABSTRACT
The discovery of fluorescence receptors that selectively bind small molecules with high affinity in aqueous media is critical for the development of new sensing and bioimaging assays. We herein report a new fluorescence receptor&#8208;dye chemosensor based on the monofunctionalization of p&#8208;sulfonatocalix[4]arene (SC4) receptor with pyrene (SC4&#8208;4Py). The SC4&#8208;4Py conjugate was found to retain the exceptional binding properties of SC4, allowing the high&#8208;affinity recognition of neurotransmitters, amino acids, and biogenic amines in aqueous solution and their optical detection. The SC4&#8208;4Py chemosensor operates through a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) mechanism triggered by conformational changes in the calixarene structure upon binding, allowing single&#8208;wavelength fluorescence detection of target analytes and its expansion into a dual&#8208;wavelength ratiometric indicator displacement assay (IDA) that relies on competitive PET between the pyrene and non&#8208;covalently bound lucigenin dye.

         <title>Bis&#8208;Dichlorosilyl Functionalized C4&#8208;Cumulene With Unique Bonding Scenario</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a silylene&#8208;functionalized C4&#8208;cumulene (2) and investigate its bonding scenario employing computational methods such as NBO analysis, AIM, and energy decomposition analysis&#8208;natural orbital for chemical valence (EDA&#8208;NOCV). The EDA&#8208;NOCV analysis showed that compound 2 prefers to possess electron&#8208;sharing covalent sigma and dative covalent sigma bonds (Si&#8596;C and C&#8594;Si) between Ph2C4 fragment in the anionic doublet state and silyl&#8208;amidine groups in cationic doublet state. This may be due to the electron&#8208;deficient nature of olefin and electron&#8208;rich N&#8208;donating functional groups on silicon atoms. Compound 2 displays unprecedented chemical bonding in this class of compounds as predicted by EDA&#8208;NOCV calculations. We have also compared the bonding situation of compound 2 with a previously reported compound 3.








ABSTRACT
This work reports the preparation and computational investigation of a bis&#8208;dichlorosilyl functionalized C4&#8208;cumulene (2), which was synthesized by employing Amidinato&#8208;chlorosilylene, L(Cl)Si: (L = PhC(NtBu)2). Compound 2 was characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, mass spectrometry, and NMR spectroscopy. The stability, distribution of spin densities, and the nature of Si&#8208;C bonds of 2 were studied by employing natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis, atoms in molecules (AIM), and energy decomposition analysis&#8208;natural orbital for chemical valence (EDA&#8208;NOCV). The EDA&#8208;NOCV analysis showed that compound 2 possesses electron&#8208;sharing covalent sigma and dative covalent sigma bonds (Si&#8596;C and C&#8594;Si) between the Ph2C4 fragment in the anionic doublet state and silyl&#8208;amidine groups in the cationic doublet state.

         <title>Enantiodivergent Synthesis of 3&#8208;Vinylphthalides via Rh&#8208;Catalyzed C&#9472;H Annulation: Experimental and Computational Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand&#8208;controlled enantiodivergent synthesis of 3&#8208;vinylphthalides has been achieved through the chiral cyclopentadienylrhodium(III) catalyzed C&#9472;H bond functionalization of arylcarboxylic acids and [4+1]&#8208;annulation reaction with cyclopropenes.








ABSTRACT
Asymmetric transition metal catalysis represents the most reliable method for the chiral induction in organic scaffolds and to synthesize a wide array of valuable 3D&#8208;molecules. However, accessing both enantiomers of the chiral molecules from a catalyst(s) having the same chirality through ingenious stereo&#8208;control has remained a highly demanding task. Herein, we disclose the catalytic enantiodivergent synthesis of 3&#8208;vinylphthalides from arylcarboxylic acids and cyclopropenes, an efficient surrogate for vinylcarbenes. Through engineering the chiral cyclopentadienylrhodium(III) catalysts, both enantiomers have been achieved with excellent yield and enantioselectivity via regioselective C&#9472;H bond functionalization using a weakly coordinating directing group and asymmetric [4+1]&#8208;annulation. Experimental and computational investigations revealed the mechanism of the oxidative annulation and enantiodetermining ring&#8208;opening isomerization of cyclopropenes, which is governed by the stereoselective cleavage of the C&#9472;C bond. The present study opens a new avenue in asymmetric C&#9472;H bond functionalization and allows access to both enantiomers of the target molecules without altering the chirality of the ligand.

         <title>Identification of Natural Isonitriles Through Ligation to an Azomethine Imine Probe</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The azomethine imine (AMI)&#8211;isonitrile (NC) ligation allowed for the chemoselective detection of natural isonitriles in bacteria and fungi. The reactivity&#8208;based screening establishes a new stereogenic center, thereby allowing for facile distinction between chiral and achiral isonitriles. The work also unraveled a unique reactivity of isonitriles bearing an &#945;&#8208;COOH group.








ABSTRACT
Natural isonitriles are promising lead compounds for medicinal chemistry. Their identification is, however, challenging due to the hydrolytic lability of the isonitrile group. Here, we use the azomethine imine (AMI)&#8211;isonitrile ligation in a reactivity&#8208;based screening protocol for the chemoselective derivatization of natural isonitriles. The herein developed AMI probe rapidly reacts with isonitriles&#8212;primary, secondary, tertiary, as well as aromatic&#8212;to stable conjugates. A dibromide mass tag enables the detection of low&#8208;abundance isonitriles, even in complex biological matrices. The ligation establishes a new stereogenic center, thereby allowing facile distinction between achiral and chiral isonitriles by the formation of racemates or diastereoisomers, respectively. In addition, a unique reactivity of isonitriles bearing an &#945;&#8208;COOH group was unraveled. This AMI probe enabled the detection of known bacterially produced isonitriles and the identification of a novel fungal isonitrile.

         <title>Magnesium(I)&#8208;Mediated Dearomatizing Coupling of Pyridines and Subsequent Hydrogen Transfer Reactions</title>

The Mg&#9472;Mg&#8208;bonded compound [K(THF)3]2[LMg&#9472;MgL]2 (1, L = [(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)NC(CH3)]22&#8722;) promotes reductive 4,4&#8242;&#8208;homocoupling of pyridines under ambient conditions and the coupled products can behave as H&#8208; (or D&#8208;) donors for hydrogenation of unsaturated bonds (C&#9552;C and C&#9552;N) in different types of substrates.








ABSTRACT
The Mg&#9472;Mg&#8208;bonded compound [K(THF)3]2[LMg&#9472;MgL]2 (1, L = [(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)NC(CH3)]22&#8722;) can promote reductive 4,4&#8242;&#8208;homocoupling of pyridine and derivatives under ambient conditions, yielding the 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridinate products 2&#8211;6. Interestingly, these species can be viewed as &#8220;dimerized&#8221; metal&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyridinates (bis&#8208;M&#8208;DHPs) and can transfer hydrogen or deuterium (as proton and hydride) to pyridines, imines and alkenes. This may provide a facile access to new H/D&#8208;donors, readily obtained from commercially available pyridines and a conveniently synthesized magnesium(I) complex, for controllable H&#8208;transfer (HT) to different types of unsaturated molecules. The coupling and HT mechanisms were elucidated by DFT calculations.

         <dc:description>
This work comprehensively summarizes the synthetic strategies to overcome the instability of Br+ species, with a focus on introducing the emerging and powerful [N&#8943;Br&#8943;N]+ motif and its application in halogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (XOFs). Current findings highlight the considerable potential of this motif to advance the development of controllable functional materials, thereby facilitating the design of stable Br+&#8208;bridged XOFs for use in catalysis, precision medicine, and related fields.








ABSTRACT
Noncovalent halogen bonding, particularly the three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8208;4e&#8722;) [N&#8943;X&#8943;N]+ motif, represents a critical tool in supramolecular chemistry and materials science. While I+&#8208;based systems are well&#8208;studied, this review focuses on the emerging and highly functional [N&#8943;Br&#8943;N]+ motif and its application in halogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (XOFs). The authors comprehensively summarize the synthetic strategies required to overcome the instability of the Br+ species, including halogen bond network spatial constraint, cation substitution, ligand exchange, and precise anionic regulation. Structural analysis reveals that the shorter N&#8943;Br bond length (2.07 &#197;) and stronger electron&#8208;deficient characteristics of the Br+&#8208;bridge provide unique functional advantages. This structural superiority translates to enhanced performance in applications such as selective alcohol oxidation and highly efficient photocatalytic H2O2 production, where XOFs(Br) materials consistently outperform their I&#8208;analogues and molecular precursors. Furthermore, it also highlights the potential of XOFs(Br) in biomedical fields, including superior antimicrobial activity and applications in photothermal therapy. This work confirms the significant potential of the [N&#8943;Br&#8943;N]+ motif to drive future innovation in controllable functional materials, paving the way for the design of stable Br+&#8208;bridged XOFs for catalysis, precision medicine, and others.

         <title>Modulating Supramolecular Topology via Hydrogen Bonding in a Eumelanin Monomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective methylation of a eumelanin monomer tunes hydrogen interactions, transforming helical assemblies into zigzag motifs and modulating excitonic interactions. This work reveals hydrogen interactions as a key handle for directing supramolecular topology and optical behavior.








ABSTRACT
Eumelanin is a bio&#8208;pigment with remarkable photoprotective properties, whose function is tied to its complex supramolecular organization. Although hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions are recognized as key forces in shaping its architecture, their individual contributions remain poorly defined. Among its molecular precursors, the canonical monomer 5,6&#8208;dihydroxyindole (DHI) is notable for forming extensive hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks that stabilize supramolecular assemblies. To clarify how hydrogen bonding influences supramolecular topology in eumelanin precursors, we investigate selectively methylated derivatives of DHI, examining how subtle modifications to hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs alter crystal packing, intermolecular arrangements, and optical properties. Single&#8208;crystal structures reveal that O&#8208;methylation (DMI) changes hydrogen&#8208;bonding dimensionality yet preserves helical assemblies, whereas full O&#8208; and N&#8208;methylation (DMI&#8208;Me) suppresses hydrogen&#8208;bonding, giving rise to zigzag arrangements dominated by van der Waals forces. Solid&#8208; and solution&#8208;state NMR measurements independently confirm the differences in the hydrogen&#8208;bonded assemblies. Complementary electronic spectroscopy shows that noncovalent architectures of the eumelanin derivatives exhibit pronounced excitonic coupling between neighboring chromophores. Electronic structure calculations support these observations, demonstrating that coupling originates primarily from Coulombic interactions, with minimal contributions from charge transfer. By linking molecular substitution to packing motifs and excitonic interactions, this work establishes hydrogen bonding as a design element for directing supramolecular order and emergent optoelectronic behavior in eumelanin&#8208;inspired materials.

&lt;p&gt;Eumelanin is a bio-pigment with remarkable photoprotective properties, whose function is tied to its complex supramolecular organization. Although hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions are recognized as key forces in shaping its architecture, their individual contributions remain poorly defined. Among its molecular precursors, the canonical monomer 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI) is notable for forming extensive hydrogen-bonded networks that stabilize supramolecular assemblies. To clarify how hydrogen bonding influences supramolecular topology in eumelanin precursors, we investigate selectively methylated derivatives of DHI, examining how subtle modifications to hydrogen-bonding motifs alter crystal packing, intermolecular arrangements, and optical properties. Single-crystal structures reveal that O-methylation (DMI) changes hydrogen-bonding dimensionality yet preserves helical assemblies, whereas full O- and N-methylation (DMI-Me) suppresses hydrogen-bonding, giving rise to zigzag arrangements dominated by van der Waals forces. Solid- and solution-state NMR measurements independently confirm the differences in the hydrogen-bonded assemblies. Complementary electronic spectroscopy shows that noncovalent architectures of the eumelanin derivatives exhibit pronounced excitonic coupling between neighboring chromophores. Electronic structure calculations support these observations, demonstrating that coupling originates primarily from Coulombic interactions, with minimal contributions from charge transfer. By linking molecular substitution to packing motifs and excitonic interactions, this work establishes hydrogen bonding as a design element for directing supramolecular order and emergent optoelectronic behavior in eumelanin-inspired materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

We report the synthesis bis(arylethynyl)naphtho&#8208; and anthraquinones via Rh(I)&#8208;catalyzed [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition reactions. The substrate scope of both quinones and linked bis&#8208;diynes was explored. Microwave irradiation remarkably enhanced yields. A fluorescent bis(methoxy)&#8208;bis(arylethynyl)naphthalene was synthesized, which underwent an unusual photooxidation in air under sunlight.








ABSTRACT
Herein, we report the Rh&#8208;catalyzed [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition of linked bis(diynes) Ar&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;(CH2)3&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;Ar with quinones for the rapid and efficient assembly of rigid structures containing bis(arylethynyl)naphthoquinones or anthraquinones using microwave radiation. The photophysical properties of the products were investigated, including absorption, emission, transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy, and singlet oxygen luminescence studies. However, the quinones did not exhibit photoluminescence or detectable singlet oxygen luminescence. Computational analysis via density functional theory (DFT) was performed to elucidate the electronic and structural factors influencing their behavior. Moreover, reductive methylation of one of the bis(arylethynyl)naphthoquinones (3aa) generated the fluorescent bis(methoxy) naphthalene derivative 4aa (&#934;f = 0.53). However, 4aa underwent photooxidation in air under sunlight via reaction with 1O2, which it sensitized, leading to ring opening of the bis(methoxy)arene ring.

         <title>Synergistic Alloy and Support Effects in Covalent Organic Framework&#8208;Stabilized AuPd Catalysts for Aerobic 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Oxidation to 2,5&#8208;Furandicarboxylic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AuPd alloy nanoparticles were anchored on 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to integrate alloy&#8208;support synergistic effects. The catalyst Au67Pd33/TTATP achieved &gt;99% FDCA yield with the high metal utilization efficiency under mild conditions, owing to the synergy effect optimized reactant/product adsorption&#8208;desorption.








ABSTRACT
Catalytically converting 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) underpins renewable, bio &#8208;based plastics, yet designing metal&#8208;efficient catalysts remains challenging. Here, we combine alloy and support effects by anchoring AuPd alloy nanoparticles on 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Rationalizing alloy composition and COF functionality yielded Au67Pd33/TTATP, which converted HMF &#8594; FDCA in water using atmospheric O2 mild conditions, delivering &gt;99% FDCA yield, stable reusability, a turnover number (TON) of &#8764;100 at HMF/metal = 100, increasing to 518 at 600 (86.4% yield). High performance stems from alloy&#8208;support synergy that (i) partitions function (Au: HMF dehydrogenation; Pd: O2 activation) and (ii) matches adsorption&#8208;desorption (TTATP enriches HMF yet releases FDCA; alloy surfaces moderate HMF binding and avoid the strong FDCA adsorption of Pd alone), thereby enhancing metal atom efficiency.

         <title>Self&#8208;Calibrating Ratiometric DNA Aptamer Probe for Quantitative ATP Imaging in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed the RFA&#8211;ECHO probe, an internally calibrated ATP sensor that remains responsive across millimolar ATP levels. Its self&#8208;correcting Cy5/ECHO ratio ensures accurate quantification independent of probe uptake. Compared with FRET&#8208;based sensors, it yields a robust ratiometric shift, distinguishing high&#8208;ATP cancer cells from normal ones, enabling reliable metabolic imaging and diagnostics.








ABSTRACT
Accurate monitoring of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&#8212;the universal energy currency of cells&#8212;is essential for elucidating cellular metabolism and disease progression. However, the high basal concentration of intracellular ATP (1&#8211;10&#160;mM) and variable probe uptake during imaging have hampered the development of reliable fluorescent sensors. Although DNA aptamer&#8208;based probes provide excellent selectivity, conventional turn&#8208;on designs often lack internal calibration, and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer&#8208;based ratiometric probes typically exhibit limited signal changes. We report a ratiometric DNA duplex sensor comprising a Cy5&#8208;labeled ATP aptamer and a thiazole orange (TO)&#8208;labeled exciton&#8208;controlled hybridization&#8208;sensitive fluorescent oligonucleotide (ECHO) probe. Upon ATP binding, the aptamer structure switches and releases the reporter strand, resulting in a pronounced decrease in TO fluorescence while the Cy5 signal remains constant. Rational insertion of a polythymidine spacer effectively suppressed undesired TO&#8208;to&#8208;Cy5 energy transfer, enabling a reliable ratiometric Cy5/ECHO readout. The sensor operates robustly across physiological ATP concentrations, exhibits high nucleotide selectivity and satisfactory serum stability, and shows minimal cytotoxicity. Live&#8208;cell flow cytometry and confocal imaging further confirmed that cancer cells displayed significantly higher Cy5/ECHO ratios than normal fibroblasts. This internally self&#8208;calibrating aptamer sensor thus provides a powerful platform for intracellular ATP imaging and cancer diagnostics.

         <title>Coordination Complexes and Polymers of Novel Hybrid Tetrazole&#8208;Triazole&#8208;Pyrazole Ligands: Synthesis, Structural Characterization, and Biological Evaluation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of new triazole, pyrazole, and tetrazole&#8208;based ligands and their coordination complexes with FeII, CoII, NiII, CuII, and CdII were synthesized and fully characterized, including crystal structures. M&#246;ssbauer and SQUID studies confirmed the high&#8208;spin state of the FeII complex. Most metal complexes showed higher cytotoxicity than their free ligands in human cancer cell lines. CoII complexes 2 and 8 displayed the strongest anticancer activity with IC50 values in the micromolar range.








ABSTRACT
New series of triazole/pyrazole and tetrazole/triazole/pyrazole ligands were synthesized and coordinated with various transition metals to yield a diverse library of 14 complexes. All compounds were fully characterized by elemental analysis, mass spectrometry, powder X&#8208;ray diffractometry, and a range of spectroscopic techniques (1H NMR, 13C NMR, FT&#8208;IR, and UV&#8211;visible diffuse reflectance). The crystal and molecular structures were elucidated via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, and their supramolecular features were explored through Hirshfeld surface analysis. The 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer and magnetic SQUID measurements confirmed the high&#8208;spin nature of the FeII complex 1. In the three human cancer cell lines, most metal complexes are somewhat more cytotoxic than the inactive ligands, with Co(II) complexes 2 and 8 being the most potent in two of the cell lines (with IC50 values in the two&#8208;digit micromolar range). Overall, this study highlights how blending tetrazole/triazole/pyrazole ligands with transition metals can lead to coordination compounds with potential in anticancer research, as a proof of concept. These results add valuable insight to the expanding field of metal&#8208;based therapeutics and could help guide the development of next&#8208;generation, more effective agents.

         <title>Exploiting the Intrinsic Peroxidase Activity of Unspecific Peroxygenase for the Oxidative Cyclization of Ortho&#8208;Substituted Phenols</title>

ABSTRACT
Fungal unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) have emerged as powerful catalysts for diverse oxidation reactions. While previous studies have predominantly focused on their native mono(per)oxygenase activity, their full catalytic potential remains underexplored. Herein, we demonstrate that the intrinsic peroxidative activity of UPOs can be effectively leveraged for the straightforward synthesis of benzoxazole compounds. Using the unspecific peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita, a broad range of ortho&#8208;patterned phenolic substrates were efficiently converted into high&#8208;value benzoxazoles with conversions of up to 99% under the neat reaction conditions. The enzyme exhibited superior catalytic performance compared to the well&#8208;established horseradish peroxidase. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that phenoxyl radicals generated by UPO's intrinsic peroxidase activity are essential for benzoxazole formation. This work not only presents a mild and efficient synthetic route to benzoxazoles but also expands the known reactivity and oxidative chemistry of UPOs.

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalyzed Remote Bisvinylogous Initiated Formal [4+2] Cycloaddition Reaction of &#946;&#8208;Allyl Cycloalkenones With in situ Generated Ortho&#8208;Quinone Methides</title>

         <dc:description>
The first Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed, &#949;&#8208;regioselective, remote bisvinylogous initiated formal [4+2] cycloaddition of &#946;&#8208;allyl cycloalkenones with ortho&#8208;quinone methides (o&#8208;QMs) has been developed. In this transformation, &#946;&#8208;allyl cycloalkenones serve as dienophiles, while o&#8208;QMs act as diene precursors, enabling efficient access to naphthopyran derivatives with excellent selectivity under mild conditions.








ABSTRACT
In this work, we disclose that &#946;&#8208;allyl cycloalkenones can serve as effective bisvinylogous precursors through in situ generation of trienalcohol intermediates under Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. This strategy enables a direct and highly diastereoselective &#948;,&#949;&#8208;regioselective remote bisvinylogous initiated formal [4+2] cycloaddition of &#946;&#8208;allyl cycloalkenones with ortho&#8208;quinone methides (o&#8208;QMs). In this process, &#946;&#8208;allyl cycloalkenones act as dienophiles while o&#8208;QMs function as diene precursors, providing efficient access to naphthopyran derivatives with excellent selectivity. Additionally, the asymmetric variant was also investigated using a BINOL&#8208;derived chiral Br&#248;nsted acid, thereby extending the utility of this method toward enantioselective synthesis.

         <title>Highly Potent Fluorogenic Ligands for Triplex DNA: 5&#8208;Substituted 2&#8208;(Naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;4H&#8208;Chromen&#8208;4&#8208;Ones</title>

5&#8208;Substituted 2&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;4H&#8208;chromen&#8208;4&#8208;ones are reported as a novel class of highly potent and selective triplex DNA ligands. These ligands induce triplex formation at submicromolar concentrations and inhibit enzymatic activity via ligand&#8208;mediated triplex formation. Binding to triplex DNA triggers an intense blue fluorescence emission in representative compound 3b, whereas no significant fluorescence emission occurs with duplex DNA.








ABSTRACT
We previously reported two series of 5&#8208;substituted flavonoids that selectively bind to triplex DNA while interacting minimally with duplex DNA. Our studies suggest that flavonoids are a promising scaffold for designing triplex ligands, owing to their mild synthesis conditions and ease of structural modification. In the present work, we introduce a novel class of highly potent triplex&#8208;specific ligands [5&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;4H&#8208;chromen&#8208;4&#8208;ones], developed by expanding the aromatic surface of the flavone moiety. UV thermal denaturation studies indicate these compounds strongly stabilize triplex DNAs, enabling their direct dissociation into random coils without transitioning through a duplex intermediate. Circular dichroism (CD) analysis reveals that these ligands induce much greater conformational changes in triplex DNA compared to duplex DNA. Fluorescent intercalator (FID) displacement assays cross&#8208;verify the importance of pendant chains for triplex binding. Viscosity measurements suggest that these compounds bind to triplex DNA via intercalation. Notably, a representative compound (3b) emits strong blue fluorescence upon binding to triplex DNA, allowing direct visualization under UV illumination and providing a convenient method for probing triplex DNA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay confirms that 3b promotes triplex formation at submicromolar concentrations. Additionally, a plasmid&#8208;based assay developed in our lab demonstrates that 3b inhibits DraI endonuclease activity at low micromolar concentrations.

         <title>2&#8208;(Diphenylphosphinoyl)acetyl Group Enabled Divergent Synthesis of 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;Acetyl Phenylethanoid Glycosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The DPPA&#8208;directed strategy applied for the synthesis of 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl phenylethanoid glycosides (PGs) is described. The key DPPA group enables stereoselective glycosylation and selective late&#8208;stage deprotection, delivering PGs with retention of susceptible acetyl group.








ABSTRACT
Phenylethanoid glycosides (PGs), featuring a phenylethanoid glucoside core, exhibit diverse biological activities, notably neuroprotective effects. However, PGs bearing the susceptible 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl group remain scarcely explored owing to their limited natural occurrence and the difficulty of preserving esters during synthesis. Herein, we describe the synthesis of such PGs, keeping the 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl group intact via a remote DPPA&#8208;directed glycosylation strategy. The 2&#8208;(diphenylphosphinoyl)acetyl (DPPA) group ensures high stereocontrol through hydrogen&#8208;bonding in glycosylation, and can be selectively removed under mild Mg(OMe)2&#8208;promoted conditions. This approach enables streamlined access to both acetylated and non&#8208;acetylated PGs, including cistanosides&#160;E, G, and H, as well as the proposed structure of lophanthoside A. The developed method provides a general platform for constructing PGs bearing acyl groups and supports further investigation of their bioactive mechanisms.

         <title>Enhanced Activity and Stability of Horseradish Peroxidase via Immobilization on Hierarchical Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical Covalent Organic Frameworks (H&#8208;COF (PS)) are prepared using Polystyrene Spheres (PS) template. Created macrospores provide space for enzyme while the micropores concentrate substrates. The porous skeleton protects the loaded enzyme from inactivation at high temperature and in organic solvents. The horseradish peroxidase loaded is efficient in dye decolorization and 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenol degradation.








ABSTRACT
In this work, hierarchical covalent organic frameworks (H&#8208;COF (PS)) were prepared via a hard template strategy using polystyrene spheres (PS) as the template. The H&#8208;COF (PS) exhibits high stability in aqueous solution without skeleton collapse. When used as a carrier for enzyme immobilization, the H&#8208;COF (PS) shows several outstanding advantages. The well&#8208;defined macropores and micropores are distributed throughout the COF. The created macrospores provide sufficient space for distribution of enzyme while the intrinsic micropores can concentrate substrates. The macropores and micropores in H&#8208;COF (PS) are adjacent, so the substrate can access to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) with lower diffusion resistance than that in solution, resulting in enhanced enzymatic catalytic activity. The porous skeleton in H&#8208;COF (PS) can protect the embedded enzyme from inactivation caused by high temperature and organic solvents, ensuring HRP stability under strict reaction conditions. The prepared HRP immobilized H&#8208;COF (PS) (HRP@H&#8208;COF(PS)) demonstrates high efficiency in dye decolorization applications. This work provides a new platform to design enzyme&#8208;nanomaterials composites with both high activity and stability.

     alt="Enhanced Activity and Stability of Horseradish Peroxidase via Immobilization on Hierarchical Covalent Organic Frameworks"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hierarchical Covalent Organic Frameworks (H-COF (PS)) are prepared using Polystyrene Spheres (PS) template. Created macrospores provide space for enzyme while the micropores concentrate substrates. The porous skeleton protects the loaded enzyme from inactivation at high temperature and in organic solvents. The horseradish peroxidase loaded is efficient in dye decolorization and 2,4-dichlorophenol degradation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, hierarchical covalent organic frameworks (H-COF (PS)) were prepared via a hard template strategy using polystyrene spheres (PS) as the template. The H-COF (PS) exhibits high stability in aqueous solution without skeleton collapse. When used as a carrier for enzyme immobilization, the H-COF (PS) shows several outstanding advantages. The well-defined macropores and micropores are distributed throughout the COF. The created macrospores provide sufficient space for distribution of enzyme while the intrinsic micropores can concentrate substrates. The macropores and micropores in H-COF (PS) are adjacent, so the substrate can access to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) with lower diffusion resistance than that in solution, resulting in enhanced enzymatic catalytic activity. The porous skeleton in H-COF (PS) can protect the embedded enzyme from inactivation caused by high temperature and organic solvents, ensuring HRP stability under strict reaction conditions. The prepared HRP immobilized H-COF (PS) (HRP@H-COF(PS)) demonstrates high efficiency in dye decolorization applications. This work provides a new platform to design enzyme-nanomaterials composites with both high activity and stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Amplified Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Chiral AIE&#8208;active Tetraphenylbutadiene Derivatives in Nematic Liquid Crystal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microscale doping of chiral AIE&#8208;active tetraphenylbutadiene derivatives (TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;H, TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;CHO, and TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;OC6) into the achiral nematic LC 5CB induces the formation of helical supramolecular architectures through host&#8208;guest interactions, yielding CPL&#8208;active composites that exhibit both a high dissymmetry factor (glum = +0.58) and an excellent photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;PL = 84.5%).








ABSTRACT
Circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) materials featuring high luminescence dissymmetry factors (glum), high photoluminescence quantum yields (&#934;PL), and tunable emission properties are essential for practical applications. Herein, three chiral aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) tetraphenylbutadiene (TPB) derivatives (TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;H, TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;CHO, TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;OC6) with high &#934;PL were synthesized, each bearing symmetric chiral bis&#8208;cholesteryl moieties and different electron&#8208;donating/accepting groups. When employed as chiral dopants, minute quantities of each derivative were individually doped into the achiral nematic liquid crystal (LC) 5CB, affording three series of luminescent chiral nematic LC composite systems (TPB&#8208;N*&#8208;LCs). These composites exhibit remarkable CPL activity with high glum values, attributed to host&#8208;guest interactions that facilitate co&#8208;assembly into ordered supramolecular helices and chiral amplification, despite the chiral AIE dopant itself lacking CPL emission. CPL signals and glum values enhance with increasing chiral dopant loading, peaking at +0.31, +0.42, and +0.58 for TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;H/5CB, TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;CHO/5CB, and TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;OC6/5CB, respectively, at 3 wt% doping. Notably, the introduction of electron&#8208;donating hexyloxy groups (TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;OC6) or electron&#8208;accepting aldehyde groups (TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;CHO) modulates molecular packing, compatibility with 5CB host, and intermolecular interactions. Doping TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;OC6 into 5CB achieves the optimal performance, with glum = +0.58 and &#934;PL = 84.5%. This work offers an effective strategy for developing CPL materials with simultaneously high glum and &#934;PL.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Benzylic Substitutions Through &#951;3&#8208;Benzyl&#8208;Metal Intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite their significant synthetic value, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric benzylic substitutions remain undeveloped compared to the Tsuji&#8208;Trost reaction, primarily due to the inherent challenge associated with endothermic dearomatization. Several catalytic strategies have been explored to overcome the corresponding issues, including single metal, bimetallic, metal/organo, and ternary catalysis.








Abstract
Although transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric benzylic substitution is conceptually analogous to asymmetric allylic substitution, proceeding via &#951;3&#8208;benzyl&#8208;metal and &#951;3&#8208;allyl&#8208;metal intermediates, respectively, the development of the former, involving benzylic electrophiles, has received comparatively less attention within the synthetic community. This limited progress is largely attributed to the low reactivity of benzylic electrophiles and the associated challenge in achieving stereoselective control. Over the past several decades, different catalytic strategies, such as single metal catalysis, bimetallic catalysis, metal/organo catalysis, and ternary catalysis, have been developed to address these challenges. Asymmetric versions of these transformations have also been established, enabling the construction of stereocenters either at the benzylic electrophiles, at nucleophile, or simultaneously at both sites. This review provides a comprehensive overview of this field from its inception to the present. It summarizes advances in substrate scope, mechanistic understanding, synthetic applications, and remaining challenges, with the aim of fostering further progress in this emerging area.

ABSTRACT
The identification of drug targets remains one of the most critical challenges in pharmaceutical research. The rapid progress of artificial intelligence (AI) is significantly advancing this landscape by enabling more efficient and accurate drug&#8208;target interaction prediction. AI&#8208;driven approaches can integrate and analyze massive biomedical datasets, elucidating complex signaling networks and providing systematic insights into drug mechanisms of action. These developments have greatly accelerated virtual screening, binding affinity estimation, and target identification. However, despite these advancements, key challenges persist, such as ensuring the precision of predictions and overcoming the barriers to integrating AI tools with drug target discovery. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent public databases, advanced computational methods, and user&#8208;friendly AI tools, highlighting both their potential and challenges. It also offers practical guidance for researchers without computational expertise, illustrating how these technologies can be effectively incorporated into current research workflows to advance drug target discovery and ultimately accelerate the development of novel therapeutic drugs.

         <title>Construction of Covalent Organic Cages for Molecular Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>

The covalent organic cage (COC) is a significant concern for molecular recognition due to its preorganized 3D cavities, customizable binding sites, and outstanding chemical stability. Here, this concept article briefly summarizes the common COCs construction strategies and demonstrates how condensation of these COCs influences the encapsulation of various guests.








ABSTRACT
Molecular recognition is a crucial process in multiple areas, including separation, storage, and catalysis etc. Covalent organic cages (COCs), owing to their preorganized 3D cavities, customizable binding sites, and outstanding chemical stability, have been widely used for molecular recognition. Among the components of COCs, the covalent linkers play a crucial role in molecular recognition by shaping cavities and providing noncovalent interactions. In this concept, we exemplified recent progress in COC&#8208;based host&#8208;guest recognition, briefly summarized the bonding strategies (both dynamic and irreversible) used in covalent linkers for COC construction, and discussed how these linkers influence guest encapsulation by adjusting size, shape, and binding sites of their cavities. These insights are expected to provide a reference for the design of novel COCs for molecular recognition.

         <title>Catalytic Oxidation of Commodity Plastics: Advances in Polyethylene and Polystyrene Valorization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent progress in the catalytic oxidative upcycling of polyethylene and polystyrene, emphasizing catalyst design, reaction mechanisms, and product selectivity. By comparing different catalytic systems and oxidation strategies, it highlights how molecular&#8208;level control of active oxygen species can transform inert plastics into valuable chemicals. The review also outlines future directions in catalyst innovation, process optimization, and sustainability assessment to guide the development of efficient and industrially viable plastic upcycling technologies.








ABSTRACT
Polyethylene and polystyrene are among the most representative hard&#8208;to&#8208;degrade plastic due to their chemical inertness and massive generation, making their efficient upcycling a pressing challenge for environmental sustainability. Conventional recycling methods, such as incineration, landfilling, and mechanical processing, often cause high energy consumption, severe pollution, and product devaluation, which is unfavorable for circular utilization of plastics. In contrast, chemical recycling, particularly catalytic oxidation, has recently gained much attention for enabling plastic valorization under relatively mild conditions, with straightforward separation processes and high&#8208;value products. Despite these advantages, catalytic oxidation remains at an early stage, facing challenges such as unclear catalyst structure&#8208;activity relationships, insufficient reactivity, and limited selectivity. To address these issues, this review highlights recent advances in the catalytic oxidative conversion of polyethylene and polystyrene, focusing on catalyst design, reaction mechanism elucidation, and product selectivity control. Furthermore, perspectives are provided on future research directions, including the development of novel catalysts, optimization of mass transfer, regulation of reactive oxygen species, adaptability to mixed plastic waste, techno&#8208;economic analysis, life cycle assessment, and reaction safety evaluation.

         <title>Recent Advances in Synthesis and Applications of Functional Rare&#8208;Earth Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents a systematic overview of the synthetic strategies for rare earth metal&#8208;organic frameworks (RE&#8208;MOFs), emphasizing the design and roles of metal nodes and ligand structures, and provides a comprehensive summary of their current applications in detecting volatile organic compounds, small molecules, cations, anions, biomarkers, and temperature, as well as in optical encoding and anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies, and rare earth separation.








ABSTRACT
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have garnered significant attention over the past few decades due to their diverse chemical architectures and tunable physicochemical properties, culminating in the award of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2025. By integrating various metal nodes with organic linkers, MOFs offer extensive opportunities for rational design, controlled synthesis, and multifunctional applications. From structural and functional perspectives, MOFs incorporating rare earth (RE) elements (such as scandium, yttrium, and the 15 lanthanides) constitute a distinct subclass of MOFs. The structural diversity of RE metal&#8208;organic frameworks (RE&#8208;MOFs) is intrinsically correlated with their unique functional characteristics, which primarily stem from the precise selection of metal centers and the deliberate design of organic ligands. This review presents a systematic overview of the synthetic strategies for RE&#8208;MOFs, emphasizing the design and roles of metal nodes and ligand structures, and provides a comprehensive summary of their current applications in detecting volatile organic compounds, small molecules, cations, anions, biomarkers, and temperature, as well as in optical encoding and anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies, and rare eart separation.

         <title>Highly Efficient Organocatalytic House&#8208;Meinwald Rearrangement for the Facile Synthesis of Aldehydes: Swift Access to Ibuprofen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We use readily available epoxides and 0.5 mol% bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (Tf2N) as a catalyst to synthesize a broad range of aldehydes in yields ranging from 89% to 97%. Furthermore, we identified aldehyde dimerization intermediates at lower temperatures and observed their cleavage at 55 &#176;C. To demonstrate the applicability of our new approach, we synthesized ibuprofen in a three&#8208;step process with an overall yield of 90%.








ABSTRACT
We present a new organocatalytic method for synthesizing aldehydes under mild conditions using readily accessible terminal epoxides as starting materials and bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (Tf2NH) as the catalyst. We identified intermediate aldehyde dimerization products at lower temperatures and observed their cleavage at 55&#176;C. We isolated the products in yields of 89&#8211;97% using catalyst loadings as low as 0.5 mol%. To underline the applicability of our new approach, we synthesized ibuprofen in a three&#8208;step process and overall yield of 90%.

Friedel&#8211;Crafts Arylation of Indoles: Use of an iminosulfonate derivative as the photoacid generator for the Friedel&#8211;Crafts arylation reaction between aldehydes and indoles under inert atmosphere.








ABSTRACT
Photochemistry enables transformations inaccessible through ground&#8208;state pathways. We report a sustainable and operationally simple Friedel&#8211;Crafts arylation using benzophenone oxime tosylate, in low catalyst loading, as the photoacid generator under inert conditions. The method accommodates a broad substrate scope, affording diarylmethane derivatives in good to excellent yields. Mechanistic studies elucidate key intermediates driving the transformation.

An ambiphilic bis&#8208;imino terminal olefin was synthesized and comprehensively characterized, demonstrating air, moisture, and thermal stability. It shows distinct reactivity compared to traditional NHOs, leading to the isolation of two unique N&#8208;containing heterocycles.








ABSTRACT
In this article, we report a novel bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic imino) terminal olefin, [{(CAAC)N}2C&#9552;CH2] [CAAC = cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene], which exhibits reactivity distinct from traditional N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins. The use of the (CAAC)&#8211;derived ambiphilic N&#8208;heterocyclic imino fragment {(CAAC)N&#8210;} was crucial in imparting the unique properties of [{(CAAC)N}2C&#9552;CH2]. The imino groups act as strong electron donors, rendering the terminal olefin polar through &#960;&#8208;delocalization, whereas the carbenic carbon of CAAC introduces an electrophilic site into the imino substituent. This combination results in an inherently ambiphilic olefin that displays unusual reactivity. Specifically, the reaction of [{(CAAC)N}2C&#9552;CH2] with tosyl azide, under varying stoichiometric conditions, furnished four distinct nitrogen&#8208;rich compounds, including two unprecedented nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations were carried out to elucidate the bonding features of the ambiphilic bis&#8208;imino terminal olefin as well as the newly formed heterocycles.

The power of catalytic promiscuity: The enantioselective conjugate hydrocyanation of enals remains a long&#8208;standing challenge for biocatalysis. Here, we report the redesign of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate aldolase for the asymmetric conjugate hydrocyanation of aromatic enals, expanding the reaction scope of iminium&#8208;based enzyme catalysis to include an additional new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reaction.








ABSTRACT
The enantioselective conjugate hydrocyanation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes remains a long&#8208;standing challenge in synthetic chemistry. Here, we report the redesign of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate aldolase (DERA) into an efficient biocatalyst capable of promoting the asymmetric conjugate addition of hydrogen cyanide (generated in situ from trimethylsilyl cyanide) to aromatic enals via an iminium activation pathway. The evolved variant DERA&#8208;CN enables the efficient formation of various C4&#8208;nitriles with high conversions (up to 99%) and good enantioselectivity (up to 98% e.e.). Control experiments revealed a stepwise process involving enzyme&#8208;catalyzed conjugate hydrocyanation followed by spontaneous 1,2&#8208;addition of cyanide. Substrates with various electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups are tolerated, providing access to various enantioenriched nitriles. This work expands the scope of DERA&#8208;promoted iminium catalysis and provides a rare enzymatic platform for asymmetric conjugate hydrocyanation under mild aqueous conditions.

         <title>Simultaneous Grafting of 3,4,5&#8208;Trihydroxypiperidine Iminosugars Onto Multivalent Scaffolds via Double Reductive Amination Provides New GCase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small set of low&#8208;valency multivalent 3,4,5&#8208;trihydroxypiperidines was prepared through double reductive amination (DRA) of a sugar&#8208;derived dialdehyde. Among them, trivalent derivative 37 emerged as a potent &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase (GCase) inhibitor displaying an unexpected mixed&#8208;type kinetic profile. The integration of kinetic analysis, NMR, docking, and MD simulations shed light on the molecular basis of the binding to the target enzyme.








ABSTRACT
Low&#8208;valency multivalent iminosugars have recently emerged as promising inhibitors of the therapeutically relevant enzyme &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase (GCase). A new synthetic strategy has been developed to simultaneously build more than one trihydroxypiperidine iminosugar unit onto a polyamine scaffold via double reductive amination (DRA) of a d&#8208;mannose derived dialdehyde. Five divalent derivatives, using both aliphatic and aromatic diamines and a trivalent compound based on an aromatic scaffold have been synthesized and evaluated as GCase inhibitors. Only oligomers with an aromatic core (26, 31, and 37) strongly inhibit GCase with IC50 values in the low micromolar range and activity enhancements, when compared to the monovalent counterpart, that confirm the occurrence of a positive multivalent effect. Kinetic analysis for divalent 31 and trivalent 37 revealed a mixed&#8208;type inhibition. To rationalize the unexpected behavior of 37, an integrated biophysical and computational approach based on STD&#8208;NMR, docking, and MD simulations was employed, allowing to clarify the structural basis for its inhibitory profile and paving the way to the rational design of novel inhibitors able to bridge multiple interaction sites of the target enzyme.

         <title>Multistate Azobenzene&#8211;Norbornadiene Photoswitches for Molecular Solar Thermal Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systems consisting of two different photoswitches (azobenzene and norbornadiene) are presented, which can be switched by light, store energy, and release it again. The combination of the switching units leads to synergistic effects.








ABSTRACT
The combination of two photochromic molecules into a multimodal photoswitch offers the potential to generate new properties related to molecular solar thermal (MOST) systems. A system can only be considered suitable for MOST applications if it meets key criteria, including a high quantum yield and an extended half&#8208;life of the high&#8208;energy isomer. Achieving this combination remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present the coupling of an azobenzene unit (AZO) with a norbornadiene system (NBD) via ester functions to develop new bi&#8208; and trimodal AZO&#8208;NBD photoswitches that exhibit synergistic effects. Photochemical studies reveal that both the NBD and AZO components of the hybrid are switchable. In one case, all isomer types could be selectively produced. Furthermore, each metastable unit can be switched back independently to its corresponding thermodynamically stable form. The quantum yields and half&#8208;lives for the NBD and AZO components of the hybrid system could be determined separately. The integration of AZOs has demonstrated the potential to extend the half&#8208;lives of NBDs to up to 122 days in certain cases, as confirmed through comparative analysis with reference systems. The enhanced rate of back&#8208;conversion was further facilitated by the presence of TFA as a catalyst.

         <title>Impact of Hole Transporting Layers on the Composition of Chemical Vapor Deposited Perovskite and Performance of Semitransparent Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reveal that the surface properties of the substrate play a crucial role in determining the surface composition and optoelectronic properties of the perovskite films. By optimizing the HTL, we achieved 17.5% efficiency for semitransparent perovskite solar module via all vacuum deposition processes.








ABSTRACT
Low&#8208;pressure chemical vapor deposition (CVD) offers good scalability, substrate compatibility, and solvent&#8208;free processing for metal halide perovskite films fabrication, yet limited control over the film composition has hindered the device performance compared to solution&#8208;based methods. Herein, we investigate how the substrate surface property affect the composition and optoelectronic properties of perovskite films fabricated by CVD. By changing the hole transporting layers (HTLs), different crystallization process and chemical stoichiometry of perovskite films have been observed. Perovskite films grown on nickel oxide|self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) exhibit a more stoichiometric buried surface, along with a higher work function (WF) and enhanced p&#8208;type character that are favorable for hole transport. Leveraging these insights, we demonstrate all vapor&#8208;deposited semitransparent perovskite solar cells (ST&#8208;PSCs) with a champion efficiency of 18.0%, retaining &#8764;100% of the initial performance after 500 h of continuous operation (ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1). Furthermore, we achieve a champion efficiency of 17.5% for semitransparent mini&#8208;modules fabricated via the all&#8208;vacuum process.

&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (CVD) offers good scalability, substrate compatibility, and solvent-free processing for metal halide perovskite films fabrication, yet limited control over the film composition has hindered the device performance compared to solution-based methods. Herein, we investigate how the substrate surface property affect the composition and optoelectronic properties of perovskite films fabricated by CVD. By changing the hole transporting layers (HTLs), different crystallization process and chemical stoichiometry of perovskite films have been observed. Perovskite films grown on nickel oxide|self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) exhibit a more stoichiometric buried surface, along with a higher work function (WF) and enhanced p-type character that are favorable for hole transport. Leveraging these insights, we demonstrate all vapor-deposited semitransparent perovskite solar cells (ST-PSCs) with a champion efficiency of 18.0%, retaining &#8764;100% of the initial performance after 500 h of continuous operation (ISOS-L-1). Furthermore, we achieve a champion efficiency of 17.5% for semitransparent mini-modules fabricated via the all-vacuum process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>XFEL&#8208;Detected Peroxide Formation From the S3 State Supports the Low Oxidation State over the High Oxidation State Paradigm in Photosystem II</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations show that peroxide formation from the S3 state is inconsistent with the HOS model, as Mn(IV) readily oxidizes peroxide to O2. In contrast, the LOS model stabilizes the peroxide observed by XFEL, since Mn(III) cannot promote further oxidation.








ABSTRACT
The mechanism of O&#8211;O bond formation in PSII is still debated. Although it is generally accepted to occur during the S3 &#8594; [S4] &#8594; S0 transition, some studies suggest it may already begin in the S3 state. Notably, the 2017 XFEL study by Suga et&#160;al. supports this hypothesis by reporting structural features consistent with a peroxide intermediate formed from the S3 state. Here, we present DFT calculations showing that, in the high oxidation state (HOS) model, O&#8211;O coupling starting from the S3 state with the hydroxo&#8211;oxo configuration is kinetically feasible, forming a peroxide intermediate via a modest activation energy of 19.5&#160;kcal/mol. However, in the HOS model, the resulting peroxide would be readily converted to O2 with &#916;G&#8225; = 11&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1, inconsistent with experimental observations that O2 release proceeds only after reaching the [S4] state. In contrast, we show that if peroxide forms from the S3 state, its persistence is more plausibly explained by the low oxidation state (LOS) model, where further conversion to superoxide or O2 is energetically unfavorable. This distinction between these two models stems from the greater oxidizing power of Mn(IV) in the HOS paradigm relative to Mn(III) in the LOS paradigm in promoting peroxide&#8208;to&#8208;O2 conversion.

         <title>Triggering and Preventing Cyclization of o&#8208;Amino&#8208;Guanidinobenzenes to 2&#8208;Amino&#8208;Benzimidazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
o&#8208;Amino&#8208;guanidinobenzenes are generally prone to cyclization to 2&#8208;amino&#8208;benzimidazoles. In this work, strategies to prevent such cyclizations are developed, allowing to use these compounds as ligands in coordination chemistry and for the design of novel (unsymmetrical) redox&#8208;active ligands.








ABSTRACT
Aromatic compounds in which a primary or secondary amino group is positioned next (in ortho position) to a guanidino group have been reported as intermediates in a variety of reactions, but are generally prone to cyclization to give 2&#8208;amino&#8208;imidazoles. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis, based on experiments and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, of the stability and reactivity of these compounds. It is shown that cyclization reactions are triggered by Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acids. The analysis discloses strategies allowing to prevent cyclization by careful choice of the guanidino group and/or substituent at the amino group. The results of this analysis allowed the synthesis of first unsymmetrical diguanidinobenzene molecules and coordination compounds with o&#8208;amino&#8208;guanidinobenzene ligands, paving the way for the development of aromatic compounds with adjacent amino and guanidino groups as a versatile class of redox&#8208;active organic molecules.

         <title>Oxidative Addition of C&#8208;F Bonds to the Phosphoranide Ion [P(C2F5)2F2]&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The difluorobis(pentafluoroethyl)phosphoranide anion (&#955;$\lambda $4&#963;$\sigma $4&#8208;phosphate) reacts with substrates containing activated C&#9472;F bonds (Rf&#160; = &#160;perfluoroaryl, &#8208;alkenyl, and &#8208;acetyl) yielding corresponding trifluorophoshates. The colorless solids exhibit a high thermal stability and are bench stable. This reaction behavior extends the toolbox for possible functionalization of inherently strong C&#9472;F bonds.








ABSTRACT
Oxidative additions of C&#9472;Hal bonds (Hal&#160; = &#160;F, Cl, Br, I) are widely known for a variety of transition metal complexes owing to their range of oxidation states and flexible coordination sphere. Low valent main group element compounds were shown to mimic this reaction behavior, due to the propensity of changing their oxidation state and coordination number by +2. Yet the addition to C&#9472;F bonds is especially challenging due to a large bond dissociation energy. While several examples are known for compounds from group 13 and 14, only few reports demonstrate this type of reaction for compounds from group 15. Herein we report the first anionic P(III) species undergoing an oxidative addition of C&#9472;F bonds. The tetracoordinated [P(C2F5)2F2]&#8722;&#8208;anion reacts readily with fluorinated arenes, olefins, and acid fluorides yielding respective hexacoordinated P(V) phosphates under mild conditions.

The functionalization of a dicopper(II, II) complex with a pyrene anchoring group allows to build functional electrodes for the toluene partial oxidation in different solvents.








ABSTRACT
A novel dicopper(II, II) complex (Cpyrene) was attached on multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) electrodes resulting in a nanohybrid electrode (MWCNT@Cpyrene) able to partially oxidize toluene to benzaldehyde and benzyl alcohol with 300 and 409 TON h&#8722;1, respectively, in 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene. Exchanging the solvent by acetonitrile leads to the additional N&#8208;benzylacetamide formation from the C&#8211;N coupling of toluene and in situ solvent oxidation with 313 TON h&#8722;1 at room temperature.

After analysis of several named reactions and discussion of improvements, recent advances in the synthesis of alkynes are discussed. Each section contains a proposed reaction mechanism and analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the approaches.








Abstract
Alkynes are among the most useful functional groups in synthetic chemistry, as they are excellent starting materials for various reactions and serve as valuable precursors during total synthesis. Despite the high number of transformations that utilize alkynes as substrates, few methods actually exist to synthesize them. Known methods involve several synthetic steps, harsh conditions, or cryogenic temperatures, which render them inconvenient and inefficient. This review of alkyne syntheses cover methods that enable the formation of all three bonds of the alkyne's triple bond in a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, one&#8208;pot fashion. This review offers a guide to gauge if current methods are potentially suitable to be scaled and used in industry and pharmaceutical processes.

         <title>Unveiling the Chemical Space of Astin&#8208;Type Peptides in Aster Tataricus, Cyanodermella Asteris, and Talaromyces Islandicus</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The plant Aster tataricus and its endophytic fungus Cyanodermella asteris are sources of a unique class of halogenated pentapeptides called astins. In addition, the fungus Talaromyces islandicus produces the astin&#8208;related class of pentapeptides, cyclochlorotines. Through molecular networking and mass spectrometry fragmentation data, we uncover a huge chemical diversity among the astin and cyclochlorotine pool of pentapeptides, which also reflects the genetic homology of both nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) systems and deepens our understanding of astin biosynthesis and enzymology.








ABSTRACT
The plant Aster tataricus L.f. is known as the main source of astin&#8208;type cyclopentapeptides. However, recent studies have shown that the endophytic fungus Cyanodermella asteris contains a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) ast encoding for astin core&#8208;structure biosynthesis and that it produces three astins, namely astins C, F, and G. The foodborne fungus Talaromyces islandicus produces the structurally highly related cyclochlorotine mycotoxins encoded by the BGC cct with significant genetic homology to ast from C. asteris. We thus became interested in exploring and comparing the astin&#8208;type peptide diversity found in these three source organisms to answer the long&#8208;standing question of the true metabolic origin of the astins. Mass spectrometry&#8208;based molecular networking and fragmentation trees revealed that A. tataricus, C. asteris, and T. islandicus indeed contain many more derivatives, hence uncovering a huge peptide chemodiversity resulting from promiscuous NRPS systems regarding amino acid selectivity. Both NRPS systems produce structurally related and even a number of identical compounds. Our findings reveal comprehensive metabolic insights strongly indicating that the endophyte C. asteris is the sole producer of the astin peptide family and, contrary to previous assumptions, metabolic cross&#8208;talk with the host plant is unlikely to have a major impact on astin structural diversity.

         <title>Synthetic Studies towards Darobactin A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The urgent need for new antibiotics led us to develop a new methodology for the synthesis of the natural product darobactin A selectively targeting gram&#8208;negative bacteria. This study provides new insights into the synthesis of strained indole&#8208;containing macrocycles. Key steps comprise a nucleophilic aromatic substitution&#8211;Bartoli indole synthesis&#8211;Negishi coupling alkylation sequence as well as a Larock indole macrolactamization.








ABSTRACT
We describe our efforts toward the total synthesis of darobactin A, an antibiotic that selectively targets Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. The first route comprised the preparation of two separate advanced fragments. The unusual ether&#8208;linked tryptophan moiety was constructed utilizing a nucleophilic aromatic substitution&#8208;Bartoli indole synthesis&#8208;Negishi coupling sequence, while C&#8208;H arylation was used to prepare the &#946;&#8208;arylated lysine scaffold. Larock indole synthesis was confirmed as a valuable approach to achieve the first macrocyclization. An approach using macrolactamization for the construction of the second, western macrocycle proved to be unsuitable for the darobactin A scaffold. Thus, a second strategy focused on the synthesis of both macrocycles through two distinct intramolecular Larock indole syntheses that further brought valuable insights into the atroposelectivity of such reactions. Herein, we report our study toward the total synthesis of darobactin A, including the synthesis of advanced intermediates.

Here we report a synthesis of the dinucleotide 4 for a projected future total synthesis of the m7G cap 1. Highlights of the route include: 1) a 3&#697;&#8208;H&#8208;phosphonate/5&#697;&#8208;selenocyanate Michaelis&#8208;Arbuzov coupling to forge the 3&#697;,5&#697;&#8208;phosphoroselenolate; 2) an Amosova reductive selenomethylation to install the 2&#697;&#8208;SeMe; 3) a solid CPR II 5&#697;&#8208;O&#8208;phosphitylation; and 4) an aq. tBuO2H 5&#697;&#8208;O&#8208;phosphite oxidation without accompanying selenoxide formation. Also, MeCN has been found to be especially beneficial for the SN2 reactions of 10 and the iodide 12.








ABSTRACT
In this paper, a solution&#8208;phase total synthesis is described of the 5&#697;&#8208;O&#8208;phosphorylated 2&#697;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#697;&#8208;selenomethyl&#8208;adenosine 3&#697;,5&#697;&#8208;phosphoroselenolate guanosine dinucleotide (4) using a rt, 2,6&#8208;lutidine&#8208;mediated, nucleoside 3&#697;&#8208;H&#8208;phosphonate/5&#697;&#8208;selenocyanate Michaelis&#8208;Arbuzov ligative coupling, whose potential mechanism is discussed herein. Our route to 4 is predicated upon the highly efficient new 2&#697;&#8208;O&#8208;triflate selenocyanate anion displacement of 10 in MeCN, to obtain the 2&#697;&#8208;selenocyanate 9, which was allied with an Amosova NaBH4/MeI mediated reductive selenomethylation in MeOH. A novel solid CPR II&#8208;mediated 5&#697;&#8208;O&#8208;phosphitylation of the dinucleotide alcohol 6 and a 70% aqueous t&#8208;BuO2H oxidation successfully installed the 5&#697;&#8208;O&#8208;phosphate moiety within 4 without oxidizing the 2&#697;&#8208;selenomethyl group. It is envisaged that 4 will be of value for a future total synthesis of the m7G cap 1; a molecule of potential utility for therapeutic mRNA manufacture.

         <title>Boric Acid Promoted Base&#8208;Free Chan&#8208;Lam Amination Reaction: A Computationally Inspired Mechanistic Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In silico studies are carried out to underpin the mechanistic features in B(OH)3 promoted CL amination under base&#8208;free condition. Mechanistic effect on organoborane:amine stoichiometry inversion exemplified with transmetalation as rate&#8208;determining.








ABSTRACT
CuII&#8208;catalyzed oxidative coupling reactions based on Chan&#8208;Lam (CL) protocol have established themselves as one of most reliable and practical synthetic tools for the efficient formation of carbon&#8208;nitrogen/heteroatom bonds. Since decades this methodology has witnessed considerable development in its application scope, industrial uptake and fundamental mechanistic knowledge. Despite its successful application and popularity, the underlying mechanistic understanding remains underdeveloped and unexplored. Current theoretical investigation underpins the mechanism of CL&#8208;based amination reaction under base&#8208;free conditions employing the transmetalation by&#8208;product B(OH)3 as promoter. The rate&#8208;determining transmetalation involves an energy span of 26.4&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1 with subsequent overall disproportionation and reductive elimination barrier of 25.4&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1, accompanying stable intermediates in comparison to the base&#8208;mediated CL amination. The aryl migration involves a unique six&#8208;membered transition state unlike similar transition&#8208;metal catalyzed transmetalation event. The CuI&#8594;CuII oxidative regeneration is facile in the presence of B(OH)3 coordinated intermediates. The calculated results are in line with experimental kinetic studies and for the first time elucidates the mechanistic effect of inverting the organoboron: amine stoichiometry. Furthermore, Hammett studies involving substituted aryl boronic acid substrates reveals electron&#8208;rich substitution to entail lower transmetalation barrier. Overall, the boric acid stabilized copper intermediates are thermodynamically stable, allowing the amination to occur at improved time frame.

Despite its successful application and popularity, the underlying mechanistic understanding remains underdeveloped and unexplored. Current theoretical investigation underpins the mechanism of CL-based amination reaction under base-free conditions employing the transmetalation by-product B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as promoter. The rate-determining transmetalation involves an energy span of 26.4&#160;kcal mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with subsequent overall disproportionation and reductive elimination barrier of 25.4&#160;kcal mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, accompanying stable intermediates in comparison to the base-mediated CL amination. The aryl migration involves a unique six-membered transition state unlike similar transition-metal catalyzed transmetalation event. The Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&#8594;Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; oxidative regeneration is facile in the presence of B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; coordinated intermediates. The calculated results are in line with experimental kinetic studies and for the first time elucidates the mechanistic effect of inverting the organoboron: amine stoichiometry. Furthermore, Hammett studies involving substituted aryl boronic acid substrates reveals electron-rich substitution to entail lower transmetalation barrier. Overall, the boric acid stabilized copper intermediates are thermodynamically stable, allowing the amination to occur at improved time frame.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of the First Generation of Glycosylated Nucleoside Analogues as Potential Inhibitors of the Base J Metabolism in Kinetoplastid Parasites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel analogues of the kinetoplastid&#8208;specific DNA base J unlock a new way to target parasite epigenetic regulation. Some compounds selectively inhibit Leishmania and Trypanosoma species without harming human cells, revealing a promising route toward innovative antiparasitic therapies.








ABSTRACT
Leishmaniasis and trypanosomiasis are severe parasitic infections with significant impacts on veterinary and public health, particularly affecting the poorest populations. The therapeutic arsenal against these neglected tropical diseases is limited, and the emergence of resistance to available medicines complicates treatment. These kinetoplastid parasites share a unique DNA modification, that is &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucosyl&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxymethyluracil (base J), which appears to play an essential role in parasite development and survival through an original epigenetic mechanism, allowing adaptation to environmental changes. To date, the regulatory pathway of this unique nucleobase has not been explored as a potential therapeutic target. In this work, we report the synthesis of several families of base J analogues and assess their potential against different kinetoplastid species. Some compounds have shown antiparasitic activity and no toxicity toward human primary fibroblasts, revealing promising new strategies for antiparasitic therapy.

         <title>Alkene Functionalizations via the Alkenyl Catellani Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the functionalization of nonaromatic systems via Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis (namely, the alkenyl Catellani reaction). The nonaromatic substrates include uracil, 2&#8208;quinolone, 2&#8208;pyridone, alkenes, coumarin, chromone, glycal, and 1,2&#8208;azaborine, all of which generate a broad range of functional alkenes. In addition, this review outlines developments in asymmetric alkenyl Catellani reactions and highlights their use in the total synthesis of structurally complex molecules.








ABSTRACT
Palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) cooperative catalysis is widely regarded as an effective strategy for constructing polysubstituted arenes, providing a rapid and efficient route that is often difficult to accomplish using traditional cross&#8208;coupling methods. This review focuses on applying Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis to the functionalization of nonaromatic systems, referred to as the alkenyl Catellani reaction. The nonaromatic substrates discussed include uracil, 2&#8208;quinolone, 2&#8208;pyridone, alkene, coumarin, chromone, glycal, and 1,2&#8208;azaborine, all of which generate a broad range of functional alkenes.

         <title>Hydrogels Formed by the Self&#8208;Assembly of Collagen&#8208;Mimetic Peptides With a Constrained Backbone Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinked collagen&#8208;mimetic peptides (kinkCMPs), whose backbone is constrained by a disulfide bond, are designed to induce hydrogel formation. The kinked backbone promotes supramolecular assembly into tunable hydrogels with thermal stability depending on length. The resulting gels are also applicable as cell culture scaffolds, providing a new strategy for peptide&#8208;based biomaterials.








ABSTRACT
Self&#8208;assembling peptides have attracted increasing attention as building blocks for developing functional materials. Among them, collagen&#8208;mimetic peptides (CMPs) represent a class of self&#8208;assembling systems. However, although short&#8208;chain CMPs spontaneously fold into thermodynamically stable triple&#8208;helical trimers, they fail to further undergo supramolecular assembly to form hydrogels. We report a new strategy for supramolecular hydrogel formation based on CMPs. The designed peptide, termed kinkCMP, features a kinked backbone introduced at the center of the sequence via adjacent disulfide bonds. The kinkCMP forms a gel, and its gel denaturation temperature can be tuned by varying the peptide chain length. Moreover, the hydrogel can be used as a cell culture scaffold. These results provide a versatile approach for constructing supramolecular hydrogels based on CMPs, expanding the design strategies for peptide&#8208;based functional materials.

2,3&#8208;Dihydrobenzopyrans were synthesized highly diastereoselectively from phenols and 2&#8208;cinnamoylpyridine 1&#8208;oxides via Sc(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed tandem Michael addition and hemiketalization process under mild conditions. The diastereoselectivity is controlled thermodynamically, but is impacted by steric and electronic effects. The current study provides a new synthetic toolbox for benzopyran derivatives.








ABSTRACT
Scandium triflate&#8208;catalyzed tandem reaction of electron&#8208;rich phenols and 2&#8208;cinnamoylpyridine 1&#8208;oxides is realized. This protocol enables the highly diastereoselective construction of 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzopyrans (chromanes) via a domino Michael addition (Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation) and hemiketalization process under mild conditions. Using 2&#8208;cinnamoylpyridine 1&#8208;oxides as Michael acceptors, electron&#8208;rich phenols can be extended to methylphenols. The diastereoselectivity is mainly decided by the stability of diastereomeric products, but is impacted by steric and electronic effects. The current study expands the synthetic toolbox for benzopyran derivatives.

         <title>Metalloporphyrin Monolayers as Tunable Platforms for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystalline monolayers of Fe and Cu porphyrins on graphite enable nanometer&#8208;precision mapping of active sites for CO2 electroreduction. High&#8208;resolution STM reveals &#8764;1.5 nm periodicity and quantitative active site distribution. Faradaic efficiencies scale with surface composition, with Fe outperforming Cu, establishing direct structure&#8211;activity correlations at the molecular level.








ABSTRACT
While molecular electrocatalysis for CO2 reduction has advanced significantly, a key challenge persists in accurately defining the active site distribution, surface density, and structural organization of heterogenized catalysts at electrode interfaces. In this study, we address this gap by employing self&#8208;assembled monolayers of physisorbed metal porphyrins (Fe and Cu) on graphite electrodes as structurally well&#8208;defined model systems for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). High&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) revealed crystalline monolayers with uniform active site distribution, offering periodicities of &#8764;1.5 nm. These monolayers exhibit moderate Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) for CO production, with Fe porphyrin outperforming its Cu analogue. Isotopic labeling experiments were employed to confirm that the product CO originates from added CO2. Bicomponent monolayers comprising Fe porphyrin and catalytically inactive free&#8208;base porphyrin were fabricated to investigate composition&#8211;activity relationships. STM imaging enabled direct, quantitative assessment of surface composition, and subsequent CO2RR measurements revealed a systematic decrease in FE with increasing coverage of the catalytically inactive component. These findings demonstrate the utility of molecularly ordered porphyrin monolayers as a powerful platform for probing structure&#8211;activity relationships in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction with exceptional spatial and compositional precision.

         <title>Synthesis of Peptides, Peptide Nucleic Acid Components, and other Biogenic Compounds from a Three&#8208;Component Prebiotic Mixture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;energy proton irradiation of a formamide&#8211;diaminomaleonitrile&#8211;glycine system in the presence of meteorites produces a broad spectrum of biogenic compounds, including nucleobases, nucleosides, peptides, and nucleobase&#8211;peptide conjugates, highlighting a chemically plausible prebiotic network.








ABSTRACT
We have explored the reactions of a three&#8208;components mixture made of formamide, diaminomaleonitrile, and glycine, with meteorites as catalysts and high&#8208;energy proton beam irradiation as the energy source, mimicking the solar wind. The resulting mixture contained a wide array of biogenic compounds, including the complete set of RNA nucleobases and nucleosides, thymine and its analogs, pterins, triazines, carboxylic acids, diketopiperazines, hydantoins, N&#8208;carboxyamino acid anhydrides, amino acids, peptides, and nucleobase&#8211;amino acid/peptide conjugates. It also embodies the possibility of synthesis stability of RNA&#8208;peptide chimeras onto which evolution to the extant molecular genetic system could start. The prebiotic worth of the system consists of the fact that formamide derives from HCN hydrolysis; glycine is a condensation product of formamide and HCN; diaminomaleonitrile is obtained from HCN. The fact that the starting mixture is three&#8208;component does not decrease the prebiotic value; it is a subset of a largely possible general universal condition: all the starting components are only the second step of facile condensation reactions. This model could be the starting point for the chemical evolution towards biological complexity.

         <title>Fluorescence Properties and Mg2+ Selectivity of Aryl&#8208;Alkynyl Derivatives of the o&#8208;Aminophenoltriacetate (APTRA) Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is a challenge to improve the selectivity of high&#8208;denticity ligands for Mg2+ over Ca2+. We show that in aryl&#8208;alkynyl derivatives of APTRA, electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents lower the binding affinity for Ca2+ more than Mg2+, making the ligand more selective for Mg2+. The effect is larger when the APTRA nitrogen is para to alkyne, but the associated charge&#8208;transfer fluorescence is weak in water.








ABSTRACT
Ortho&#8208;aminophenol&#8208;N,N,O&#8208;triacetate (APTRA) has been widely adopted for binding and sensing Mg2+, although it binds Ca2+ more strongly. This contribution investigates APTRA derivatives that incorporate an aryl&#8208;alkynyl fluorophore, addressing how the binding affinities for Mg2+ and Ca2+ are modulated by a substituent R in the aryl ring of the fluorophore. Six such derivatives have been synthesized via their tris&#8208;ethyl esters. They feature X &#9552; CN, CF3, or OMe, as a mesomerically electron&#8208;withdrawing, inductively electron&#8208;withdrawing, or electron&#8208;donating substituent, respectively, with the alkyne either para or meta to the APTRA nitrogen. Study of the absorption and fluorescence properties of the esters reveals the importance of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) states for X &#9552; CN and CF3, but not OMe. The corresponding carboxylate ligands are less emissive in water, and the fluorescence is not strongly modulated by metal ions. However, the absorption spectra change markedly, allowing dissociation constants Kd to be evaluated. The key conclusions are that (i) electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents attenuate the affinity for Ca2+ more than Mg2+, leading to a net improvement in selectivity for Mg2+, and (ii) the effect is larger when the APTRA nitrogen (as opposed to phenolic oxygen) is para to&#8212;and hence directly conjugated with&#8212;the alkyne.

Inducible protein expression is a cornerstone of many aspects of industrial and molecular biotechnological processes. 2&#8242;&#8208;fucosyl isopropyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;thiogalactopyranose (2&#8242;F&#8208;IPTG) and 2&#8242;&#8208;fucosyl isobutyl&#8208;C&#8208;galactoside (2&#8242;F&#8208;IBCG) mimics were explored for protein expression studies. Herein, we report the automated continuous flow syntheses of the mimics and their utility in protein expression.








ABSTRACT
Inducible protein expression is a cornerstone of many aspects of industrial and molecular biotechnological processes. However, limited availability of inducible transcription factors can reduce our ability to control expression at a population level. The design and synthesis of a powerful inducer containing a fucose is demonstrated to induce protein expression through the lac operon only in cells with the ability to selectively de&#8208;fucosylate them. Batch and automated continuous&#8208;flow processes are reported for the syntheses of both 2&#8242;&#8208;fucosyl isopropyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;thiogalactopyranose (2&#8242;F&#8208;IPTG) and isobutyl&#8208;C&#8208;galactoside (2&#8242;F&#8208;IBCG) mimics. Fucosylation of the inducer allowed for fucosidase&#8208;dependent expression of a reporter protein, providing an additional layer of control over inducible gene expression.

         <title>Programmable Intermolecular Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexes for Photothermal Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge&#8208;transfer complex nanoparticles, termed PER&#8208;TCQ, was constructed through charge&#8208;transfer interaction between the electron donor (PER) and the electron acceptor (TCQ), which exhibits efficient NIR absorption. Consequently, PER&#8208;TCQ achieves effective tumor ablation via photothermal therapy.








ABSTRACT
Photothermal therapy (PTT) is a promising tumor treatment strategy. However, developing organic photothermal agents (PTAs) with both high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) and simple synthesis remains a major challenge. Herein, we developed the charge&#8208;transfer complex nanoparticles (termed PER&#8208;TCQ), via supramolecular assembly of perylene (PER) as the electron donor and tetrachloro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TCQ) as the electron acceptor. The strong charge&#8208;transfer interaction between PER and TCQ confers PER&#8208;TCQ nanoparticles with pronounced near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption. Upon 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, PER&#8208;TCQ achieved a high PCE of 66.1%. Its effective antitumor efficacy was consistently validated by in vitro and in vivo experiments, demonstrating the great promise of such programmable complexes as high&#8208;performance organic PTAs.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Dependent Multilayered Host&#8211;Guest Assemblies Formed by a Xanthene&#8208;Based Dinuclear Nickel(II) Macrocycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A xanthene&#8208;based bis(saloph) dinickel(II) macrocyclic host, L2bNi2, forms cation&#8208;dependent assemblies with alkali metal ions. The complexation with Na+ afforded 2:1 and 1:1 (host/guest) complexes, whereas larger ions (K+, Rb+, Cs+) yielded stable dimeric complexes, which were further converted to higher&#8208;order aggregates (2:2, 2:3, and 3:2 complexes). X&#8208;ray analyses revealed hexagonaol planar coordination for Na+ and orthogonal dimeric stacking for larger cations. DFT calculations showed that reduced host&#8211;host repulsion stabilizes 2:1 complexes for larger ions.








ABSTRACT
A planar bis(saloph) nickel(II) macrocyclic host, L2bNi2, incorporating xanthene motifs and hexyl side chains, was synthesized to provide structural rigidity and solubility. Its ion recognition behavior toward alkali metal ions was investigated by 1H NMR titration, mass spectrometry, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. With Na+, a 2:1 (host/guest) sandwich&#8208;type complex was formed at 0.5 equiv, which shifted to a monomeric 1:1 complex upon further Na+ addition. In contrast, larger alkali metal ions such as K+, Rb+, and Cs+ formed stable 2:1 (host/guest) dimeric complexes, whose sandwich structures remained intact even in the presence of excess cation, resulting in the formation of 2:2, 2:3, and 3:2 higher&#8208;order assemblies, unlike those of previously reported related macrocycles. X&#8208;ray analyses revealed a rare hexagonal planar coordination for Na+ and orthogonally stacked dimeric structures for the larger cations. Theoretical calculations support the experimental trends, showing that larger alkali metal ions favor 2:1 complexation due to reduced repulsive interactions between the metallomacrocycles. These findings demonstrate that the aggregation behavior of the metallomacrocycle is sensitively tuned by the size and coordination preferences of guest cations, highlighting the utility of preorganized, metal&#8208;based macrocycles in constructing dynamic, multivalent supramolecular architectures.

&lt;p&gt;A xanthene-based bis(saloph) dinickel(II) macrocyclic host, L&lt;sup&gt;2b&lt;/sup&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, forms cation-dependent assemblies with alkali metal ions. The complexation with Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; afforded 2:1 and 1:1 (host/guest) complexes, whereas larger ions (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) yielded stable dimeric complexes, which were further converted to higher-order aggregates (2:2, 2:3, and 3:2 complexes). X-ray analyses revealed hexagonaol planar coordination for Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and orthogonal dimeric stacking for larger cations. DFT calculations showed that reduced host&#8211;host repulsion stabilizes 2:1 complexes for larger ions.

         <title>Construction of Bi&#8208;BTC/BiYO3 Heterojunction@Cellulose Acetate Composite Material and Its Efficient Photocatalytic Degradation of Tetracycline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
The widespread use of tetracycline (TC) has resulted in severe water pollution, highlighting the urgent need for efficient degradation technologies. In this study, a Bi&#8208;BTC/BiYO3/CA photocatalyst was synthesized using cellulose acetate (CA) as a carrier via a solvothermal process combined with nonsolvent&#8208;induced phase separation, and its photocatalytic performance in TC degradation was systematically evaluated. Under optimal conditions, a degradation efficiency of 95.06% was achieved. Both experimental and theoretical analyses revealed that the formation of the Bi&#8208;BTC/BiYO3 heterojunction enhances the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and improves visible&#8208;light absorption, whereas the incorporation of CA significantly boosts the material's recyclability. Various characterization methods confirmed the successful synthesis of Bi&#8208;BTC/BiYO3/CA. Additionally, the efficient carrier separation and expansion of the light absorption range achieved by the Bi&#8208;BTC/BiYO3 heterojunction were demonstrated. Notably, the photocatalyst retained 91% of its initial degradation efficiency after four recycling cycles, underscoring the potential of the CA&#8208;based composite catalyst for application in simulated wastewater treatment. This synergistic integration of a heterojunction and carrier provides a promising strategy for the effective degradation of environmental pollutants.

         <title>Helicene&#8208;Azulene Conjugates: Synthesis, Photophysical Properties and Proton&#8208;Induced Chiroptical Switching</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helicene&#8208;azulene conjugates exhibit strong electronic circular dichroic responses in the azulene absorption region and reversible chiroptical switching upon protonation/deprotonation. Their weak emission obeys the Kasha rule.








ABSTRACT
The synthesis of 4,13&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;carbo[6]helicene derivatives substituted at positions 2,15 by either 2&#8208;azulene (H&#8208;2&#8208;azu) or 6&#8208;azulene (H&#8208;6&#8208;azu) units is presented. The photophysical and chiroptical properties of these new helicene&#8208;azulene derivatives have been examined in details. Both helical constitutional isomers H&#8208;2&#8208;azu and H&#8208;6&#8208;azu exhibit strong electronic circular dichroic responses in the azulene absorption region and reversible chiroptical switching upon protonation/deprotonation. Furthermore, although very weak, emission was also observed and was analyzed as originating from the S1 excited state, i.e., obeying the Kasha rule, which is not common in azulene derivatives. Theoretical calculations helped confirm these observations. Finally, these systems revealed efficient chemical acid&#8208;base triggered chiroptical switching activity, showing notably a strong red shift upon protonation.

         <title>Synergizing Mechanochemistry and Multicomponent Reactions for Sustainable COF Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;free mechanosynthetic strategy was established for constructing quinoline&#8208;linked MCR&#8208;COFs via a three&#8208;component Povarov cascade reaction, and high&#8208;crystallinity products were efficiently synthesized by milling at 15&#160;Hz for 60&#160;min. The as&#8208;prepared MCR&#8208;COFs exhibited high crystallinity, well&#8208;defined permanent porosity, and a maximum specific surface area of 1371.6 m2/g.








ABSTRACT
Mechanochemistry has emerged as a cornerstone of sustainable synthesis, providing an energy&#8208;efficient, solvent&#8208;free alternative to conventional solution&#8208;phase methodologies while minimizing environmental impact. Despite increasing application of mechanochemical approaches for preparing diverse organic compounds, the extension of these strategies to the synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is limited up to now. Notably, the mechanochemical synthesis of multicomponent reaction&#8208;derived COFs (MCR&#8208;COFs) has not been previously reported. Herein, we demonstrate solvent&#8208;free mechanosynthesis of MCR&#8208;COFs through a three&#8208;component Povarov cascade reaction, efficiently combining aldehydes, amines, and phenylacetylenes with tert&#8208;butyl peroxybenzoate as the unique oxidant under one&#8208;pot ball&#8208;milling conditions. The resulting frameworks exhibit exceptional structural regularity, manifested by high crystallinity and well&#8208;defined permanent porosity with surface areas reaching 1371.6 m2/g. Intriguingly, the mechanosynthesized MCR&#8208;COFs exhibit a different stacking mode from the traditional solvothermal counterparts. Remarkably, these mechanosynthesized COFs can be applied to solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical reaction for the first time. This work establishes a paradigm shift in COF synthesis by merging the sustainability benefits of mechanochemistry with the accuracy of three&#8208;component cascade synthesis, while simultaneously advancing the catalytic applications of COF materials through mechanochemistry.

         <title>A Versatile Synthetic Strategy Enables the Discovery of Regioisomer&#8208;Dependent in Vivo Performance in Self&#8208;Immobilizing Hemicyanine Dyes</title>

A versatile late&#8208;stage condensation strategy enables a systematic comparative study, revealing how regioisomerism governs the in vivo performance of self&#8208;immobilizing probes.








ABSTRACT
Self&#8208;immobilizing near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorogenic probes based on hemicyanine dyes show great promise for in vivo imaging due to their superior retention efficiency at target sites. However, their broader development and application have been hampered by tedious synthetic routes and insufficient understanding of how structural variations govern performance in complex biological systems. Herein, we report a versatile and efficient late&#8208;stage condensation strategy that provides easy access to a series of self&#8208;immobilizing hemicyanine dyes, enabling the first systematic comparison between 5&#8208; and 7&#8208;regioisomers. Although both probes showed strong fluorogenic responses to alkaline phosphatase in vitro, there in vivo behavior differed remarkably. Unexpectedly, the 5&#8208;substituted probe (P5) exhibited significantly lower tumor retention and imaging contrast in live mice than the 7&#8208;substituted analogue (P7). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and mechanistic studies attributed this divergence to the higher reactivity and slower formation kinetics of the quinone methide intermediate generated from P5, leading to nucleophilic attack by water and rapid diffusion from the detection site in highly dynamic in vivo environments. This study not only offers a practical synthetic route but also establishes regiochemical tuning of QM reactivity and formation kinetics as a crucial design strategy for developing imaging agents suited for in vivo applications.

         <title>Waste&#8208;To&#8208;MOF: Upcycling of Waste Polyimide into Europium&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework as Efficient Fluorescence Sensor of Biogenic Amines</title>

We upcycle waste polyimide into Eu&#8208;MOFs, yielding porous, luminescent materials for ultrasensitive cadaverine detection and portable paper&#8208;based fluorescence sensing under UV light.








ABSTRACT
The fluorescence sensing method based on lanthanide metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) offers high sensitivity, selectivity, and rapid, real&#8208;time detection of biogenic amines (BAs). However, their high cost, complex synthesis, and unclear sensing mechanism limit practical application. Herein, waste polyimide is utilized as a precursor to synthesize Eu&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;benzenetetracarboxylic acid (Eu&#8208;BTEC) via a two&#8208;step hydrothermal&#8211;solution method. Under optimum conditions, the obtained Eu&#8208;BTEC exhibits excellent fluorescence selectivity and sensitivity toward cadaverine, with an apparent constant of 1.58 &#215;106 L&#183;mol&#8722;1 and a detection limit of 0.17 &#181;mol&#183;L&#8722;1. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the amino groups of cadaverine donate electrons to Eu3+, blocking the intramolecular electron transfer from the benzene ligand to Eu3+. Owing to the absence of chromophores in cadaverine, this electron transfer leads to luminescence quenching of Eu&#8208;BTEC. To achieve visual and portable detection, Eu&#8208;BTEC&#8208;based fluorescence test strips were fabricated by spraying its suspension onto filter paper, enabling visual quantification of cadaverine (0.50 &#181;mol&#183;L&#8722;1) under UV light. This study not only provides a sustainable route for converting waste polyimide into Ln&#8208;MOFs but also elucidates the BA sensing mechanism through HOMO&#8208;LUMO band&#8208;gap and electron&#8208;density analyses, offering new insights into the fluorescence quenching process of Ln&#8208;MOFs.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Formazanate Complexes as Tunable Redox&#8208;Active Materials for Non&#8208;Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron&#8208;formazanates were investigated as a chemically tunable and electrochemically robust class of redox&#8208;active materials for nonaqueous flow batteries. Electrochemical characterization, coupled with postmortem analysis, uncovers B&#9472;F bond cleavage as a key degradation pathway contributing to capacity fade. Through rational design, a diphenyl boron derivative was developed that exhibited superior cycling stability in a symmetrical flow cell.








ABSTRACT
As a broad&#8208;scale energy storage solution, redox flow batteries (RFBs) offer high efficiency and tunable design. However, conventional RFBs rely on transition&#8208;metal ion couples, (e.g., vanadium or iron), whose implementation is limited by low energy densities, high cost, and environmental leaching. Main&#8208;group compounds, comprising earth&#8208;abundant, p&#8208;block elements, represent highly promising, yet underexplored candidates for RFBs. Herein, we evaluate three boron&#8208;formazanate complexes as negolyte and symmetric electrolytes in nonaqueous organic redox flow batteries (NAORFBs). Detailed electrochemical characterization of these complexes reveals two sequential reduction processes with the first being exceptionally stable (&lt;3% capacity fade after charge/discharge cycling in a static H&#8208;cell for 3 days). In contrast, cycling that includes the two&#8208;electron reduced state results in rapid degradation (&gt;59% capacity fade over 2.5 days in a static H&#8208;cell), most likely due to fluoride elimination from the BF2 moiety. Guided by these insights, a B(Ph)2 unit was introduced to mitigate this degradation pathway. The elimination of labile B&#9472;F bonds as well as steric protection conferred by two phenyl groups led to improved cycling performance (&gt;85% capacity retention after charge/discharge cycling in a flow battery for 15 days). These findings guide the rational design of inexpensive main&#8208;group electrolytes for application in energy storage.

         <title>Silent Partners in the Mill: Unveiling the Role of Additives in Mechanochemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemistry offers a sustainable, solvent&#8208;free alternative to traditional synthesis, often enhanced by additives in a process known as additive&#8208;assisted grinding. This review discusses how various additives, including liquids, ionic solids, and advanced materials like ionic liquids and piezoelectric compounds, improve reaction efficiency, highlighting their benefits, limitations, and recent developments.








ABSTRACT
Mechanochemistry has attracted significant attention as a sustainable and efficient alternative to solution&#8208;based synthesis, offering the advantage of solvent&#8208;free conditions or the use of only minor amounts of solvent. Many established mechanochemical transformations rely on the use of additives&#8212;a strategy broadly referred to as additive&#8208;assisted grinding. The most employed additives are liquids (liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG)), ionic solids, and non&#8208;ionic additives. Additionally, ionic liquids (ionic liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (IL&#8208;AG)), piezoelectric, or mechanoluminescent materials can be used. This review provides an overview of additive&#8208;assisted organic synthetic transformations under mechanochemical conditions, highlighting the roles, advantages, and limitations of additives, as well as emerging trends from recent literature.

         <title>Orthogonal Relay Catalysis Enabling Diastereodivergent One&#8208;Pot Syntheses: Access to Enders&#8208;Type Products and Syn/Anti&#8208;selective Michael/Mannich Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two stereodivergent syntheses have been developed. One is the one&#8208;pot stereoselective synthesis of C6&#8208;diastereomer of Enders&#8217; domino reaction product and the other one is a diastereodivergent one&#8208;pot asymmetric Michael/Mannich reaction for both anti&#8208; and syn&#8208;isomers. Though one isomer is synthesized using a single catalyst, its diastereomer, which is inaccessible using the similar condition, is obtained using two similar catalysts sequentially.








ABSTRACT
We report two enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent transformations based on a one&#8208;pot relay catalysis strategy. Chiral cyclohexenecarbaldehydes, diastereomeric to the products of Enders&#8217; seminal triple domino reaction, were synthesized with excellent enantioselectivity using two structurally related chiral catalysts in a sequential fashion. While the anti&#8208;isomer was obtained via a one&#8208;pot Michael/Mannich reaction catalyzed by a single chiral catalyst, the complementary syn&#8208;isomer was selectively accessed through sequential addition of two distinct catalysts in a single vessel. In most cases optically pure products were obtained. This one&#8208;pot relay catalysis strategy enables access to complementary stereoisomers and represents a valuable alternative to traditional domino reactions and single&#8208;catalyst one&#8208;pot processes involving independent catalytic cycles.

         <title>Resolving a Nearly Two&#8208;Centuries&#8208;Old Mystery: On the Structural Chemistry and Physicochemical Properties of Compounds Associated With the Term Ammelide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal structure of ammelide, also known as melanuric acid, was solved almost 200 years after its discovery by Liebig. Moreover, three modifications of its 1:1 adduct with ammeline were structurally elucidated, consisting of layers with a honeycomb motif analogous to melamine cyanurate. Finally, ammelide's nitrate and perchlorate salts were prepared to examine the potential of ammelide as part of insensitive high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials.








ABSTRACT
Ammelide, also known as melanuric acid, is a simple molecular compound, which can be regarded as the double hydrolysis product of the industrially relevant compound melamine. Within this work, the first structural description of ammelide was provided almost 200 years after its discovery. This not only gave the first unambiguous evidence that ammelide's preferred tautomeric form in the solid is 6&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4(1H,3H)&#8208;dione, but also showed that ammelide adopts a layered structure similar to the closely related ammeline. Moreover, the crystal structures of three modifications of the 1:1 adduct between ammeline and ammelide were elucidated, which form layers with a honeycomb motif and hexagonal voids analogous to melamine cyanurate. Differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetric analysis demonstrated that both pure ammelide and its adduct with ammeline have exceptionally high thermal stabilities, resulting from their dense hydrogen bonding networks. Finally, the synthesis and structural characterization of the ammelide's nitrate and perchlorate salts were carried out to examine the potential of ammelide as part of insensitive high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials through sensitivity measurements and theoretical calculations.

         <title>Partial Phase Transition to Construct Amorphous&#8208;Crystalline Heterophase Catalyst for Enhanced CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents an alkali salt&#8208;assisted annealing method to precisely synthesize CoMnOx with tunable crystallinity and systematically elucidating the structure&#8208;activity dependency between crystallinity and CO2 photoreduction performance.








ABSTRACT
Amorphous/crystalline catalysts can effectively integrate the advantages of both phases, overcoming the low active site density in crystalline phases and the poor charge separation in amorphous ones. In this work, we report an alkali salt&#8208;assisted partial phase transition strategy to synthesize amorphous/crystalline CoMnOx&#8208;400 nanosheets for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared CoMnOx&#8208;400 demonstrates superior CO production performance (146.09 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, 93.6% selectivity), significantly outperforming amorphous CoMnOx&#8208;260 (66.65 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and crystalline CoMnOx&#8208;500 (89.52 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Supported by systematic characterizations, we propose that the high efficiency of CoMnOx&#8208;400 is attributed to two factors: (i) the charge migration between amorphous and crystalline phases across the seamless contact interface can enhance charge separation efficiency, and (ii) the amorphous domains can provide abundant surface defective active sites for CO2 adsorption and activation. This work highlights the critical role of phase engineering, particularly the construction of amorphous/crystalline structures, in advancing solar&#8208;driven catalytic applications.

         <title>Deciphering the Molecular Mechanisms of Phosphoester Bond Formation in Abiotic Conditions With Reactive Neural Network Potentials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>This study explores how phosphoester bonds, essential in biology, could form without enzymes in early Earth conditions. Using machine&#8208;learned interatomic potentials, it maps reaction pathways of two phosphate forms in water. The role of solvent in assisting proton transfers is analyzed, revealing key effects with implications for prebiotic chemistry.








ABSTRACT
Phosphoester bonds are fundamental components of both small molecules and polymeric biomolecules, most notably nucleic acids. Their formation from alcohol groups and phosphate is a significant challenge for living systems, as it involves substantial free&#8208;energy barriers. These barriers, while hindering bond formation, also ensure the kinetic stability of the resulting biomolecular structures. This duality presents a major obstacle in understanding the emergence of RNA&#8208;based systems at the origins of life, where protein enzymes capable of catalyzing such reactions were absent. Understanding the mechanisms underlying phosphoester formation is therefore essential for developing non&#8208;biological catalytic strategies. In a recent proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study (Benayad et&#160;al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 121 e2322040121 (2024)), we demonstrated that machine&#8208;learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) can be effectively trained and employed to sample the reactive pathways of the uncatalyzed reaction in water on microsecond timescales. In this work, we significantly expand upon our previous analysis to offer a detailed molecular characterization of two families of mechanisms, associative and dissociative, each associated with a variety in the order of proton exchange events. We focus on the two protonation states of phosphate prevalent under near&#8208;neutral conditions (H2PO4&#8722;${\rm H}_2{\rm PO}_{4}^-$ and HPO42&#8722;${\rm HPO}_{4}^{2-}$). We find that dissociative pathways are consistently lower in free&#8208;energy as compared to associative ones, and that H2PO4&#8722;${\rm H}_2{\rm PO}_{4}^-$ is much more reactive than HPO42&#8722;${\rm HPO}_{4}^{2-}$. Special attention is given to the role of the solvent, elucidating its involvement in the reaction process, as well as the contributions of proton transfer events and oxygen substitution at the phosphorus center. We conclude by proposing molecular&#8208;level explanations for the observed differences in reactivity between the two phosphate protonation states based on charge redistribution during the&#160;reaction.

         <title>Twisted 1&#8208; and 2&#8208;Azaperopyrenes: Synthesis, Structure, and Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
A synthesis of hitherto unknown 1&#8208; and 2&#8208;azaperopyrenes, twisted nitrogen&#8208;doped peropyrenes, is reported. The synthesis is based on a Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;mediated benzannulation of alkynes. Key alkyne intermediates are synthesized via two complementary routes, including a Pd/C&#8208;catalyzed, copper&#8208; and amine&#8208;free Sonogashira&#8208;type coupling of (hetero)aryl chlorides, enabling access to both carbo&#8208; and heteroatom&#8208;substituted peropyrene frameworks. X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals twisted conformations with bay and end&#8208;to&#8208;end twist angles ranging between 10.0&#8211;19.9&#176; and 5.5&#8211;25.0&#176;, respectively, as well as unprecedented conformational isomorphism. The influence of regioselective single N&#8208;doping within the twisted peropyrene framework on the photophysical and electrochemical properties were elucidated by combined experimental and computational studies and compared with those of the carbon congener.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Dependent DNA Binding and Cytotoxicity of Palladium(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In palladium(II) complexes with the general formula [PdAB2], the choice of the bidentate ligand A drives a different binding mode toward double&#8208;stranded DNA and is crucial for conferring cytotoxic properties to these complexes. The 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligand renders Pd(II) complexes cytotoxic, whereas (1R,2R)&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocycloexanerenders&#160;them inactive.








ABSTRACT
In the search for alternatives to platinum anticancer drugs, palladium complexes have attracted considerable interest. In this frame, six square planar palladium(II) complexes with the general formula [PdAB2] were prepared, where the ligand A is (1R,2R)&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (DACH) or 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (Phen), and the ligand B is chlorine, iodine, or pyridine. The biological properties of the investigated compounds were systematically evaluated to identify trends linked to ligand variations. The complexes were synthesized following established experimental procedures and characterized by elemental analysis and NMR spectroscopy. DNA interactions were investigated through melting experiments and the ethidium bromide (EB) displacement assay. The obtained data suggested covalent adduct formation as the preferential binding mode for the DACH&#8208;containing complexes, whereas intercalation was predominant for the phenanthroline&#8208;based complexes. Notably, at least one compound appears to interact with DNA through both modes. Cytotoxic activity was evaluated against three human ovarian cancer cell lines (A2780, A2780R, and SKOV3) as well as a healthy control cell line (HSkM, human skeletal myoblasts). Significant cytotoxic activity was observed for the Phen&#8208;containing complexes, with compound 3 also showing a good selectivity index. Conversely, DACH&#8208;containing complexes were found to be non&#8208;cytotoxic.

         <title>Harnessing MOF Derived Frustrated Lewis Pair&#8208;CeO2 Nano Catalyst for CO2&#8208;Activated Soft Oxidation of Furfural to Furoic Acid</title>

ABSTRACT
CO2 as a soft oxidant is scarcely explored in literature for furfural oxidation to furoic acid, and where CeO2, capitalizes on the synergistic effect of FLPs for enhanced CO2 reduction and furfural oxidation. This study presents a comparative analysis by the synthesis method to produce hydrothermal and MOF&#8208;derived CeO2 nanocatalyst and their effect on the formation of oxygen vacancies and metastable Ce3+ ions. The normalized surface concentration derived from XPS At% and specific surface area effectively quantifies accessible Ce3+ sites and oxygen vacancies, capturing FLP sites. Oxygen vacancies near surface Ce3+ sites (FLPs) critically modulated the catalytic performance, and evidenced by high turnover number (TON). FTIR adsorption study revealed that CO2 forms bidentate carbonate species and furfural, bi&#8208;coordination via &#951;2&#8208; (C, O) mode on the catalyst surface. Further active site masking strategy helped to understand and validate the crucial role of FLPs. The Central Composite Design model was utilized to optimize the reaction conditions and obtained high furfural conversion (99%) and furoic acid selectivity (99%). The catalyst was resistant to active site leaching and exhibited excellent stability, recyclability, and robustness. The findings highlight a potential pathway for the catalytic soft oxidation of furfural to furoic acid by CO2 utilization.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Phosphorus Cross&#8208;Anion Coupling on Rare&#8208;Earth Center</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of rare&#8208;earth azametallacyclopentadienes toward disubstituted phosphorus oxides provides a new class of seven&#8208;membered rare&#8208;earth metallacycles containing a C&#9552;P double bond. Mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction proceeds through two steps: the activation of the P&#9472;H bond of disubstituted phosphorus oxides, and a formal reductive elimination process leading to the formation of a C&#9472;P bond. PIO analyses are applied to better understand the bonding properties and electron flow of the essential transition states.








ABSTRACT
Carbon&#8208;phosphorus cross&#8208;anion coupling reaction on rare&#8208;earth center is implemented through formal reductive elimination process. Phosphine oxides with different substituents are treated to prove the universality of this method. Computational approaches are applied to confirm that the reaction generated a C&#9552;P double bond during the process, and the two&#8208;electron reductive elimination process occurs with the assistance of the butadienyl backbone. The orbital interactions of the key transition states are clarified by principal interacting orbital (PIO) analysis. This work significantly expands the applicability of rare&#8208;earth metallacycles and further reveals their unique reactivity, providing a C&#9472;P coupling, azametallacycle, metallacycle, rare&#8208;earth metal novel strategy for constructing phosphorus&#8208;containing compounds.
