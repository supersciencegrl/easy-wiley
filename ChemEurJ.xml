         <title>S&#8208;Containing Double Helicenes Featuring Robust Radical Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study introduces two S&#8208;containing double helicenes capable of forming robust radical cations. These compounds were synthesized via the Scholl reaction, which was modulated to an intermediate stage by reducing the amount of oxidant, resulting in a sulfur&#8208;containing [7]helicene. X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis reveals that both S&#8208;containing double helicenes exhibit twisted conformations consistent with the global minima identified through DFT calculations. Upon chemical oxidation with nitrosonium, these double helicenes produced &#960;&#8208;conjugated radical cations, whose radical nature was confirmed using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. These radical cations remained stable in solution when exposed to air for several weeks, as monitored by absorption spectroscopy. One of the double helicenes forms &#960;&#8208;stacked columns in the crystals of both neutral molecule and radical cation salt. The radical cation hexafluoroantimonate salt exhibits a room&#8208;temperature conductivity of up to 0.16 S cm&#8722;1, attributed to the significant &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions observed in its crystal structure. This study indicates the potential of double helical &#960;&#8208;skeletons as a versatile platform for developing resilient &#960;&#8208;conjugated radical cations without compromising &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, with potential applications in organic electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphor&#8208;Assisted TADF&#8208;Sensitized Fluorescence (pTSF) OLEDs: Faster Excitons, Brighter Futures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphor&#8208;assisted TADF&#8208;sensitized fluorescence (pTSF) synergizes phosphorescent/thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters to break spin&#8208;flip cycles in the TADF host, achieving near roll&#8208;off&#8208;free efficiency and enhanced stability at ultrahigh luminance via accelerated exciton dynamics. This review evaluates pTSF's potential for ultrahigh&#8208;luminance OLEDs (&gt;104&#160;cd m&#8722;2) through material design principles, energy transfer dynamics, and exciton management processes.








Abstract
The impressive efficiency and lifetime under ultrahigh luminance remain a long&#8208;standing challenge for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), as conventional fluorescent, phosphorescent, and thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) systems universally suffer from accelerated bimolecular annihilation at elevated exciton densities. Recently, phosphor&#8208;assisted TADF&#8208;sensitized fluorescence (pTSF) has emerged as a groundbreaking architecture that synergistically integrates exciton utilization enhancement and radiative decay acceleration through breaking the singlet&#8208;triplet spin&#8208;flip cycles in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) hosts via multiple sensitizations. The OLEDs based on pTSF achieve not only a nearly roll&#8208;off&#8208;free on external quantum efficiency but also a remarkable power efficiency, even when operating at ultrahigh luminance levels exceeding 100,000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. In this review, we delve into the intricacies of pTSF technology, examining its material design principles, energy transfer dynamics, and exciton management processes. Eventually, we critically assess the challenges in implementing pTSF for blue&#8208;emitting OLEDs and propose strategic research directions to harness the full potential of this transformative technology.

         <title>Constant pH Molecular Dynamics Simulation of pH Effects on Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Structure, Dynamics, and Metal&#8208;Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constant pH molecular dynamics simulations are used to examine the effect of pH on amyloid&#8208;&#946; and its complexes with Cu(II) and Zn(II). Changes in size and secondary structure are found, with suggestions for the origin of pH&#8208;dependent aggregation.








Abstract
We report the first molecular dynamics simulations to examine the effect of pH on the structure, dynamics, and metal&#8208;binding ability of amyloid&#8208;&#946;, the peptide implicated in the onset of Alzheimer's disease. We show that in the pH range of 6 to 8 only histidine residues show variable protonation, that predicted pKa values are in agreement with experimental data, and that changes in pH affect the size, flexibility, and secondary structure of the peptide. The binding of Cu(II) or Zn(II) to the peptide induces a shift of 1 to 1.5 pKa units in unbound histidine residues, while metal binding modes associated with higher pH induce significant changes in peptide structure. We speculate on the significance of these findings on results showing pH dependence as well as on Cu(II) and Zn(II) modulation of aggregation of Amyloid&#8208;&#946;.

         <title>Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry of Ditellurides</title>

Ditelluride exchange. Chemically and structurally diverse ditellurides undergo a rapid Te&#8208;Te exchange under mild reaction conditions in the absence of an external stimulus, indicating that ditellurides could find application in various dynamic molecular systems.








Abstract
Dynamic combinatorial chemistry enables the exploration of reversible chemical exchange reactions. Here, we report studies on the dynamic Te&#9472;Te bond exchange of chemically and structurally diverse ditellurides using 125Te NMR spectroscopy. The results revealed rapid and unbiased equilibration, forming a consistent 1:1 distribution of reactants and products across all chemical systems. Extending to multi&#8208;component mixtures, we observed robust equilibrium formation even in complex systems involving multiple ditelluride species that can be easily distinguished by 125Te NMR spectroscopy. In line with the NMR analyses showing that the Te&#9472;Te bond exchange efficiently proceeds in various solvents, at very low temperatures, in the absence of visible light, and in the presence of radical scavengers, quantum chemical analyses revealed that the ditelluride&#8208;ditelluride exchange likely proceeds via a non&#8208;synchronous concerted mechanism and not via an alternative radical mechanism. Integrated NMR spectroscopic and quantum chemical analyses also showed that the efficiency of the chalcogen&#8208;chalcogen exchange involving ditellurides follows the trend Te&#8208;Te &gt; Te&#8208;Se &gt; Te&#8208;S. Overall, the results indicate that ditellurides are excellent dynamic systems that may find applications across molecular sciences.

         <title>A Linear {FeIII2NiII} Cluster, a Structurally Closely Related Quasi 1D {FeIII2NiII} Chain</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis, characterization, and magnetic properties of two closely related heterometallic {FeIII2NiII} species are reported, upon employment of suitable amino acid Schiff&#8208;base ligands; a discrete {FeIII2NiII} trimetallic cluster and a {FeIII2Ni&#921;&#921;}n chain. Despite their striking structural similarity, they display contrasting magnetic properties, with the former showing ferromagnetic and the latter antiferromagnetic behavior.








Abstract
The solvothermal reaction between FeCl3&#183;6H2O, NiCl2&#183;6H2O, 2&#8208;hydroxynaphthaldehyde, and glycine (gly) in MeOH results in the formation of the trinuclear heterometallic cluster [Fe&#921;&#921;&#921;2Ni&#921;&#921;(L1)4(MeOH)4] (1) in good yield, while the same reaction upon replacing gly with methyl&#8208;alanine (mAla), results in the formation of the closely related quasi 1D coordination polymer {[Fe&#921;&#921;&#921;2Ni&#921;&#921;(L2)4(MeOH)2]n} (2) (L1, L2: the dianionic form of the Schiff&#8208;base ligand derived from the condensation of 2&#8208;hydroxynaphthaldehyde and gly (L1 for 1), or mAla (L2 for 2)). The structure of 1 describes a linear trimetallic {FeIII2Ni} unit, whereas complex 2 consists of repeating linear {FeIII2Ni} units with each one connected to two neighboring units via four coordination bonds, forming a quasi&#8208;1D chain. The structural similarity between complex 1 and the repeating unit of complex 2 is remarkable. However, their magnetic properties differ significantly, with complex 1 displaying dominant ferromagnetic interactions, and complex 2 showing antiferromagnetic interactions.

&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sup&gt;&#921;&#921;&lt;/sup&gt;(L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(MeOH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) in good yield, while the same reaction upon replacing gly with methyl-alanine (mAla), results in the formation of the closely related quasi 1D coordination polymer {[Fe&lt;sup&gt;&#921;&#921;&#921;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sup&gt;&#921;&#921;&lt;/sup&gt;(L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(MeOH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;} (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) (L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: the dianionic form of the Schiff-base ligand derived from the condensation of 2-hydroxynaphthaldehyde and gly (L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), or mAla (L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;)). The structure of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; describes a linear trimetallic {Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni} unit, whereas complex &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; consists of repeating linear {Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni} units with each one connected to two neighboring units via four coordination bonds, forming a &lt;i&gt;quasi&lt;/i&gt;-1D chain. The structural similarity between complex &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and the repeating unit of complex &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; is remarkable. However, their magnetic properties differ significantly, with complex &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; displaying dominant ferromagnetic interactions, and complex &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; showing antiferromagnetic interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning the Motion of Tetrafluoro&#8208;1,4&#8208;Benzoquinone Within Charge&#8208;Transfer Cocrystals Through Variation of the Donor: An Entropic and Enthalpic Point of View</title>

         <dc:description>
Five CT cocrystals using TFBQ and fused, polycyclic donors derived from fluorene are synthesized. The &#960;&#8208;stacking in all cocrystals provides a platform for the displaying of in&#8208;plane molecular motions of TFBQ, which is by supramolecular interactions. This methodology provides a platform for the development and modulation of crystalline, organic materials with motion&#8208;mediated photophysical applications.








Abstract
In this work, we report a detailed investigation on the factors affecting the in&#8208;plane motion of tetrafluoro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TFBQ) within a series of charge&#8208;transfer (CT) cocrystals formed with various fused aromatic donors. Six crystalline materials were obtained, including four cocrystals, a polymorph, and a solid solution. These were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC XRD), solid&#8208;state NMR, FTIR, UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. All cocrystals exhibited short &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions and varied noncovalent interactions (NCI) modulating the in&#8208;plane motion of TFBQ. 19F T&#8321; relaxation measurements allowed the quantification of the activation enthalpies (&#916;H&#8225;) and entropies (&#916;S&#8225;), with theoretical calculations backing these results. Cocrystal 4 is the solid with the most restricted motions due to the presence of strong hydrogen bonds. In contrast, cocrystal 3a depicts the highest in&#8208;plane motional frequencies (up to 2.2&#160;MHz at 300 K), owing to the weak contacts around TFBQ. Surprisingly, a solid solution (5), which resembled a mixture of cocrystals 2 and 3a, displayed no significant in&#8208;plane motions, despite having similar packing and relaxation behavior to the binary cocrystals. This work illustrates how subtle variations in donor structure affect the in&#8208;plane motions and photophysical properties of CT cocrystals, providing valuable insight into the rational design of functional materials.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Mediated Charge&#8208;Transfer Assemblies Composed of Resorcin[4]Arene and Viologen Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel CT assemblies consisted of a concaved aromatic host and electron&#8208;deficient organic salts are reported. The CT transition is promoted by concerted weak interactions between the components. The excited state dynamics are revealed by a theoretical study and a time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy.








Abstract
Supramolecular assemblies of a concaved aromatic host as an electron donor (D) and a cationic heterocyclic guest as an electron acceptor (A) are reported. These molecular units were noncovalently bound to afford charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complexes in solution and a CT cocrystal, displaying drastic color change from colorless to orange. The binding motif of the assemblies in the solution state was analyzed by NMR spectroscopic analysis and visualized by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Theoretical calculations for the assemblies revealed electronic communication between the D and A fragments, proving their CT characteristics. The CT complexes were stabilized by not only CT and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, but also Coulomb interaction between the cationic acceptor unit and its anion supported by a hydrogen bond with a hydroxy group in the aromatic host, resulted in enhancement of orbital overlapping of the D&#8208;A fragments. Owing to the strong D&#8208;A interaction in the assemblies, the CT complexes undergo ultrafast charge recombination on a femtosecond timescale after photoexcitation of the CT transition, as confirmed by transient absorption spectroscopy. These results demonstrate that understanding of assembly motif and its noncovalent interactions can lead to create optical materials manipulating electron transition dynamics.

         <title>Porous Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Nb2C Nanosheets for Electrocatalytic ORR to Selectively Produce H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous N&#8208;doped Nb2C nanosheets (N&#8208;Nb2C) obtained via a room&#8208;temperature ammonia etching method are presented here. The doping of N via ammonia etching results in pore structures and also effectively modulates the electronic structure, therefore leading to a larger specific surface area and more active sites of N&#8208;Nb2C. Significant improvements in two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction catalytic performance have been achieved, resulting in a H2O2 yield of 86.8%.








Abstract
The two&#8208;electron pathway in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) represents an efficient and environmentally friendly approach for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Among various types of potential catalysts, MXene have garnered significant attention due to their outstanding electrical conductivity, abundant edge active sites, and low costs. In this study, we successfully synthesize porous N&#8208;doped Nb2C nanosheets (N&#8208;Nb2C) via a room&#8208;temperature ammonia etching method and investigate their ORR performance toward the formation of H2O2. The doping of nitrogen effectively modulates the electronic structure of Nb2C nanosheets, while the abundant surface pores formed during ammonia etching facilitate the ORR process. Hence, the electrocatalytic performance of N&#8208;Nb2C nanosheets is significantly improved, demonstrating excellent long&#8208;term stability and durability. Notably, in rotating ring&#8208;disk electrode (RRDE) tests, the N&#8208;Nb2C catalyst achieves a remarkable H2O2 yield of 86.8%, highlighting its potential for selective H2O2 production through electrocatalytic ORR. Our findings suggest that N&#8208;doped Nb2C holds great promise for applications in two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction for H2O2 synthesis.

         <title>Secondary Donor Engineering for High&#8208;Efficiency Orange&#8208;Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving efficient orange&#8208;red emission in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters remains challenging due to hard to achieve great balance between small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap and high radiative decay rates. In this study, a modification site engineering strategy for secondary donors to optimize excited&#8208;state properties for orange&#8208;red emitters is proposed. Two isomeric emitters, ND28DBT and ND37DBT, were synthesized by introducing dibenzothiophene (DBT) units at different positions of a naphthalimide&#8211;dimethylacridine core. The theoretical analysis indicates that ND37DBT possesses a more favorable excited&#8208;state configuration, which facilitates an efficient reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process and accelerates the radiative decay rate. As a result, ND37DBT showed a high photoluminescence quantum yield (70%), a fast RISC rate (6.25&#215;105 s&#8208;1), and an excellent external quantum efficiency (22.1%) with minimal roll&#8208;off in 100 cd m&#8208;2. This work demonstrates that precise control of secondary donor modification sites offers a powerful molecular design strategy for developing high&#8208;efficiency orange&#8208;red TADF materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Oligomeric Protein Complexes formed by&#160;Beta Amyloid Peptides and Their Molecular Associates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aggregation and dysregulation of &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) peptides are critical factors in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigates the use of reverse micelles (RMs) as a nanoscale environment to encapsulate A&#946; peptides and explore their interactions with zinc ions (Zn2+) and a TDP&#8208;43 variant, both of which are important binding partners of A&#946; peptides closely associated with neurodegenerative diseases. We demonstrate that RMs stabilize A&#946; peptides in their oligomeric form, promoting &#946;&#8208;sheet formation and enabling detailed structural studies using solid&#8208;state NMR. Our findings reveal that Zn2+ induces specific conformational changes in residues E11 and E22 of A&#946; oligomers but not E3, and that the TDP&#8208;43 variant can form stable protein complex with A&#946;40, that persists even after extended incubation and sonication. A systematic comparison of the site&#8208;specific 13C chemical shifts of the A&#946;40 oligomers modulated by the interactions with Zn2+, A&#946;42, and a TDP&#8208;43 variant, revealed that A&#946;40 predominantly adopts a &#946;1&#8208;loop&#8208;&#946;2 motif. Notably, chemical state changes were mainly observed in the residues within the loop region and the charged residues of the &#946;1 region. In contrast, the hydrophobic residues of the &#946;&#8208;sheet regions were structurally unaltered upon protein complex formation.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Thermo&#8208;Mechanochemical Syntheses of Metal Phthalocyanines and Polyphthalocyanines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a thermo&#8208;mechanochemical synthesis of metal phthalocyanines with varying metal centers and building blocks. The reactions were performed using a Retsch Mixer Mill 400 equipped with heating jackets, achieving quantitative yields at 120 &#176;C within 2 hours. A systematic screening of reaction parameters, including temperature, reaction time, frequency, and liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG), revealed that temperature and time significantly influence the reaction outcome, as well as the use of LAG compared to neat grinding, which further enhances the yield. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of the obtained metal phthalocyanines confirmed the presence of different polymorphs, suggesting a correlation between reaction conditions and crystallinity. Furthermore, the crystalline cobalt polyphthalocyanine (CoPPc) was successfully synthesized with a yield of &gt;99%.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic and Magnetic Properties of Ferrous Iron in a True Square&#8208;Planar Molecular Environment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electronic and magnetic properties of ferrous iron in the substituted iron phthalocyanine, FePcOAr, exhibiting a true square&#8208;planar molecular environment, are investigated. Inhibition of intermolecular interactions by steric substituents, allows detailed investigation of the electronic structure arising from the planar geometry of the d6 electron configuration. Complementary magnetometry, M&#246;ssbauer, FD&#8208;FT THz&#8208;EPR and paramagnetic NMR spectroscopies show that FePcOAr has an S = 1 ground state with large positive, axial zero&#8208;field splitting and a strongly anisotropic g&#8208;tensor, with two g&#8208;values much larger than the free electron g&#8208;value and one smaller. Correlation between the magnetic properties and the electronic structure is provided by high&#8208;level quantum chemical calculations. The calculations indicate a nearly triply degenerate ground level, in which spin&#8208;orbit coupling mixes the isolated 3A2g ground state with two excited 3Eg states, whose energy gaps to the ground state are almost identical. These findings provide valuable insights in the electronic structure of phthalocyanines and the long standing discussion on their true electronic ground level, which has important implications for the application of this important class of complexes in catalysis and magnetic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrodeposition of PTCTA/ZnO Composite Films for Acetic Acid Vapor Detection at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal oxide semiconductor sensors based on zinc oxide (ZnO) and its composites are found to be very sensitive in detecting acetic acid vapor. However its operating temperatures usually exceed 200 &#176;C. In this work, an&#160;environmentally friendly and controllable electrochemical approach for constructing&#160;poly(4,4',4''&#8208;Tris(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;triphenylamine)&#160;(PTCTA) and ZnO composite films was successfully obtained for acetic acid sensing at room temperature. The conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) films of PTCTA were synthesized via an electropolymerization (EP) method using 4,4',4''&#8208;Tris(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;triphenylamine&#160;(TCTA)&#160;molecule as a precursor. Subsequently, ZnO was deposited in situ to fabricate homogeneous PTCTA/ZnO composite films. The resulting PTCTA/ZnO composite films achieved a response value of 2.42 for 200 ppm acetic acid vapor at room temperature, which was significantly outperforming standalone PTCTA or ZnO films. This enhanced sensing capability was attributed to the porous structure, the synergistic effects of the p&#8208;n heterojunction at the PTCTA/ZnO interface and the oxygen adsorption/desorption occurring on the ZnO surface. What&#8217;s more, PTCTA/ZnO composite films demonstrated structural stability and flexibility. The results suggested that the developed novel PTCTA/ZnO composite films showed great potential for acetic acid determination.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Mediated Metal&#8208;Metal and Ligand&#8208;Metal Cooperativity in Cesium Coordination Polymers. Efficient ROP Catalysis of Cyclic Esters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing a multimetallic catalyst based on the principle of metalloenzymes has emerged as a promising route to enhance catalytic performance owing to the combined action of different metal centers in a cooperative fashion. The cooperativity of metal centers with the surrounding ligand environment in metalloenzymes plays a crucial role in driving efficient catalysis. However, the replication of such cooperativity in a synthetic system is very challenging. In this work, we report the synthesis and characterization of diverse cesium coordination polymeric networks, a 2D sheet, [Cs{&#954;2&#8208;C4H3N&#8208;2(CH=N(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3))}]&#8734; (1), an infinite ladder chain, [Cs{&#954;3&#8208;C4H3N&#8208;2(CH=N(CHPh2)}]&#8734; (2), and a 3D cage [Cs2{&#954;3&#8208;(C4H3N&#8208;2(CH=NCH2CH2N(CH2CH2)2O))}]&#8734; (3). This was accomplished by a variation of the substituent on the iminopyrrolyl ligand. Moreover, we studied a breakdown of the 2D sheet coordination polymer (1) into contact pair monomeric cesium complex [(18&#8208;Cr&#8208;6)Cs(&#954;2&#8208;C4H3N&#8208;2(CH=N(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)] (4). In the coordination polymers, multiple Cs centers are held together within a proximal distance (3.5&#8211;6 &#197;) via an iminopyrrolyl ligand. The Cs coordination polymer 2 displays the highest catalytic efficiency in rac&#8208;lactide ROP, giving a TOF value of 49.5 h&#8208;1 compared to 15.7 h&#8208;1 and 24.0 h&#8208;1 for 1 and 3.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Designing a multimetallic catalyst based on the principle of metalloenzymes has emerged as a promising route to enhance catalytic performance owing to the combined action of different metal centers in a cooperative fashion. The cooperativity of metal centers with the surrounding ligand environment in metalloenzymes plays a crucial role in driving efficient catalysis. However, the replication of such cooperativity in a synthetic system is very challenging. In this work, we report the synthesis and characterization of diverse cesium coordination polymeric networks, a 2D sheet, [Cs{&#954;2-C4H3N-2(CH=N(2,6-iPr2C6H3))}]&#8734; (1), an infinite ladder chain, [Cs{&#954;3-C4H3N-2(CH=N(CHPh2)}]&#8734; (2), and a 3D cage [Cs2{&#954;3-(C4H3N-2(CH=NCH2CH2N(CH2CH2)2O))}]&#8734; (3). This was accomplished by a variation of the substituent on the iminopyrrolyl ligand. Moreover, we studied a breakdown of the 2D sheet coordination polymer (1) into contact pair monomeric cesium complex [(18-Cr-6)Cs(&#954;2-C4H3N-2(CH=N(2,6-iPr2C6H3)] (4). In the coordination polymers, multiple Cs centers are held together within a proximal distance (3.5&#8211;6 &#197;) via an iminopyrrolyl ligand. The Cs coordination polymer 2 displays the highest catalytic efficiency in rac-lactide ROP, giving a TOF value of 49.5 h-1 compared to 15.7 h-1 and 24.0 h-1 for 1 and 3. The higher reactivity of 2&#160; is due to the metal-metal cooperativity in cesium coordination polymeric networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Assembly of Water&#8208;Soluble Platinum(II) Complexes: From Emission Modulation to Cell Imaging in Specific Organelles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 30, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of amphiphilic Pt(II) complexes with tetradentate ligands exhibits distinct self&#8208;assembly properties, forming phosphorescent structures that can be tuned by variation of concentration and solvent composition. Initial in vitro studies on cells suggest structure&#8208;dependent and selective subcellular localization, pointing towards their potential as bioimaging probes.







Abstract
The control of self&#8208;organized metal complexes presents advantages regarding the modulation of luminescence through dynamic assembly, rendering them promising for bioimaging. Herein, we demonstrate a strategy towards a series of amphiphilic Pt(II) complexes featuring bis&#8208;cyclometalated ligands as tetradentate luminophores, which exhibit enhanced water solubility and tuneable self&#8208;assembly properties. The resulting nanostructures can be precisely controlled by adjusting concentration and solvent composition, yielding switchable luminescence from red (i.&#8201;e., excimer&#8208;based) to green (i.&#8201;e., monomer&#8208;centred) and reversible (dis&#8722;)assembly of the aggregates. Cytotoxicity assays confirmed the innocuous nature of these luminophores at concentrations below 10&#8197;&#956;M, while cellular uptake studies demonstrated effective internalization in both living and fixed cells. Using photoluminescence lifetime imaging micro(spectro)scopy, we determined that the complexes localized preferentially within lysosomes of living cells, while accumulating in the nuclei of fixed cells, with differences in photophysical behavior depending on whether the species were monomeric or excimeric in nature. These new findings provide insights into the systematic design of water&#8208;soluble Pt(II)&#8208;based luminophores with photophysical properties controlled by supramolecular interactions, underlining their potential for use in cellular imaging and diagnostics.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;Myrioneurinol Employing a &#8220;Resolutive&#8221; Late&#8208;Stage Barton&#8208;McCombie Deoxygenation</title>

         <dc:description>
The total syntheses of (+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;myrioneurinol are described. This was achieved through two key steps based on a Prins&#8208;type alkenylation of activated phenols to construct the central cycle of this natural substance, and a late&#8208;stage &#8220;resolutive&#8221; Barton Mc&#8208;Combie reaction which allowed the separation as well as the deoxygenation of both enantiomers of an advanced racemic intermediate.







Abstract
The so&#8208;called Barton&#8208;McCombie reaction is a transformation commonly used in organic synthesis for promoting deoxygenation of alcohols. Almost 50&#8197;years after its discovery, this reaction has become a powerful tool for organic chemists due to its wide range of applicability and functional group tolerance, which allows, with high level of anticipation, its incorporation into complex synthetic routes such as the ones aiming at the total synthesis of natural products. In this article, we describe the first example of a resolutive version of this reaction by using a chiral chlorothionoformate as the activating reagent, and its related strategic potential through a late&#8208;stage application to the total synthesis of both enantiomers of myrioneurinol, a complex tetracyclic alkaloid featuring 5 contiguous stereogenic centers.

         <title>Chiral Competition Reflected by Circularly Polarized Luminescence Signal Inversion in Supramolecular Assembly of Pyrene&#8208;Amino Acid Derivatives and &#947;&#8208;Cyclodextrin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 30, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
After binding with &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CD), the achiral pyrene derivatives follow &#947;&#8208;CD&#8242;s chirality, showing a positive circularly polarized luminance (CPL) signal. For the L&#8208;amino acid&#8208;pyrene derivatives, their chirality cooperate with that of &#947;&#8208;CD, also showing a positive CPL signal. In contrast, the competition between the chirality of D&#8208;animo acid and &#947;&#8208;CD ultimately leads to a negative CPL signal for the complex.







Abstract
Chiral competition between carbohydrates and amino acids is crucial for understanding homochirality emergence in biological systems. In this study, the chiral competitive effect between carbohydrates and amino acids through the host&#8208;guest complex formation was investigated by employing amino acid modified pyrene derivatives and naturally occurring &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CD) as chiral sources, the circularly polarized luminance (CPL) as indicator. Supramolecular complexes of achiral 1&#8208;pyrenebutyric acid and L&#8208;amino acid&#8208;pyrene derivatives with &#947;&#8208;CD exhibited positive CPL signals, with chirality derived from &#947;&#8208;CD's stereochirality. In contrast, supramolecular complexes formed by D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;pyrene derivatives with &#947;&#8208;CD showed a negative CPL signal, reflecting chiral competition between D&#8208;amino acids and D&#8208;glucose in &#947;&#8208;CD. The observed CPL signal inversion confirmed that the amino acids stood out as the dominant chiral source in chiral competition with carbohydrates. Mechanism exploration showed that the depth of insertion and stacking arrangement of the guest molecules within the &#947;&#8208;CD cavity played an essential role for the CPL inversion. Interestingly, chiral competition only occurred between D&#8208;amino acids and D&#8208;carbohydrates, while cooperation was observed between L&#8208;amino acids and D&#8208;carbohydrates, which were consistent with the natural chirality bias. This work provides new insights into homochirality emergence and the design of functional chiral materials.

         <dc:description>
Almost 50 years after the first report of the so&#8208;called Barton&#8211;McCombie deoxygenation reaction, a resolutive version of this transformation has been developed by using a chiral chlorothionoformate&#8208;type reagent. The utility of this method was demonstrated by its late&#8208;stage application to access both enantiomers of myrioneurinol, a complex tetracyclic alkaloid. More information can be found in the Research Article by P.&#160;A. Peixoto# and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202500267).

         <title>Strategies for the Synthesis of Mechanically Planar Chiral Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 30, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a systematic overview of the synthetic strategies for mechanically planar chiral rotaxanes. It covers chiral separation techniques, the utilization of chiral auxiliaries, and asymmetric catalysis, highlighting their versatility in constructing such rotaxanes. Furthermore, the review discusses the applications and future development prospects of mechanically planar chiral rotaxanes.








Abstract
Rotaxanes, belonging to the class of classical mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs), exhibit chiral properties that diverge from those of traditional chiral elements, particularly displaying mechanically planar chirality. Their distinctive spatial structure further augments their chiral significance, thereby imparting them with vast potential for applications in the realm of chiral materials and asymmetric catalysis. In recent years, mechanically planar chiral rotaxanes have garnered increasing attention from researchers. In this review, we summarize the recent advancements in obtaining enantiopure mechanically planar chiral rotaxanes. In this regard, chiral separation techniques, the use of chiral auxiliaries, and asymmetric catalytic synthesis have emerged as potent methodologies for constructing chiral rotaxanes, thereby enabling the synthesis of diverse types of mechanically planar chiral rotaxanes. Additionally, we analyze the current challenges faced in this field and look forward to the future development opportunities that lie ahead.

         <title>Binuclear Lanthanide Complexes as Magnetic Resonance and Optical Imaging Probes for Redox Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 30, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binuclear lanthanide complexes bearing nitrophenol, azophenol and azide chromophores can be reduced to the amine, giving rise to dramatic changes in the luminescence behavior. Such reductions can be achieved using enzymes as well as by chemical means. The tunable redox response and imaging modalities of these versatile complexes have the potential to open up new approaches to redox sensing.








Abstract
We report a family of lanthanide(III) complexes that act as redox probes via both magnetic resonance (MR) and luminescence outputs. The ligands are functionalized with nitro, azobenzene and azide groups which are reduced to a common aniline product, and each responds to both chemical and biocatalytic reductive conditions at different cathodic onset potentials. By judicious choice of complexed Ln(III), the probes can be optimized either for use in MR imaging (Ln&#160;=&#160;Gd), or as highly efficient turn&#8208;on luminescence probes (Ln&#160;=&#160;Tb). The Tb(III) analogues are essentially nonemissive, until reductive generation of the aniline affords a complex which when excited by visible light (488&#160;nm) emits green light with a quantum yield of 45% and millisecond long luminescent lifetimes (ms). The tunable redox response and imaging modalities of these versatile complexes have the potential to open up new approaches to redox sensing, such as the imaging of hypoxic environments in biology.

The Tb(III) analogues are essentially nonemissive, until reductive generation of the aniline affords a complex which when excited by visible light (488&#160;nm) emits green light with a quantum yield of 45% and millisecond long luminescent lifetimes (ms). The tunable redox response and imaging modalities of these versatile complexes have the potential to open up new approaches to redox sensing, such as the imaging of hypoxic environments in biology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tumor Suppression by Targeting Senescent Cells with a Selective Singlet Oxygen Releasing Endoperoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 30, May 27, 2025. </description>

&#946;&#8208;Galactosidase&#8208;triggered release of singlet oxygen is shown to target and selectively eliminate senescent cells. In addition, data obtained using tumor models reveal a significant suppression of tumor progression by targeted singlet oxygen release.








Abstract
Targeting senescent cells for cancer treatment is an important recent direction. In this work, we designed and synthesized a galactoside&#8208;functionalized pyridone endoperoxide. The endoperoxide in this form, releases singlet oxygen at a relatively slow rate, but when transformed by &#946;&#8208;galactosidase activity, the pyridone endoperoxide releases singlet oxygen with a half&#8208;life of 30 minutes at 37 &#176;C. We also studied this compound with a variety of cell lines with differential &#946;&#8208;galactosidase expression levels. Cytotoxicity of the target compound is enhanced in high galactosidase&#8208;expressing SKOV&#8208;3 cells. In vivo tests with tumor models also showed significant suppression of tumor progression. Targeting singlet oxygen to senescent cells appears to be promising new approach for treating diseases concurrent with aging, including cancer.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Binding Properties of Non&#8208;Intercalating Water&#8208;Soluble Organometallic Ir(III) Luminophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 30, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of water&#8208;soluble, organometallic iridium(III) complexes has been studied with respect to their DNA binding behavior. A combined biophysical and computational study reveals the subtle interplay of non&#8208;intercalative DNA binding events that are modulated by small changes in ligand structure.








Abstract
A series of Ir(III) complexes, [Ir(C^N)2(en)]+ (where C^N&#160;=&#160;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;benzo[d]thiazolyl cyclometalating ligand; en&#160;=&#160;ethylene diamine), is reported with structural variation via a substituent (H, Me, OMe, Cl, OCF3) at the coordinated phenyl ring. The complexes were soluble in aqueous buffer, with solubility limits correlating inversely with the predicted logP. The complexes display efficient visible absorption at 400&#8211;500&#160;nm (&#949; &#8764; 5000&#160;M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1) due to charge&#8208;transfer transitions and are triplet emitters in aerated buffer (&#955;em&#160;=&#160;529&#8211;540&#160;nm; lifetimes up to 0.763 &#181;s; &#934;em&#160;&#8804;&#160;12%). Each complex was investigated, via computational and biophysical experiments, in the context of DNA binding. According to UV&#8208;visible titrations, the cationic complexes bind to DNA with apparent affinities ranging from 6&#160;&#215;&#160;104 to 5&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;M&#8722;1 with apparent binding site sizes between 0.4 and 1.0 base pairs. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) showed that complexes [Ir(L1&#8208;3)2(en)]Cl bind to DNA in two types of binding sites, viz., a high&#8208;affinity (107&#8211;108&#160;M&#8722;1) binding site with characteristics of minor or major groove binding and a low&#8208;affinity binding site (105&#160;M&#8722;1) with characteristics of non&#8208;specific binding to negatively charged DNA, with binding supported by hydrophobic interactions between complexes.

         <title>Efficient and Selective Transformations of &#945;&#8208;Keto Esters into &#945;&#8208;Arylated &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Esters Using Continuous&#8208;Flow System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 30, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemoselective nucleophilic addition of aryllithium reagents to the keto&#8208;carbonyl moiety in &#945;&#8208;keto esters as ambident carbonyl electrophiles has been achieved by using flash continuous&#8208;flow system that has overcome the problems in the conventional batch reaction system. One or multiple competitive ester moieties remained intact despite the high reactivities of aryllithium reagents including the short&#8208;lived functionalized species that cannot survive in the batch reaction system. 








Abstract
This research explores the selective reactions of organolithium reagents with &#945;&#8208;keto esters using a flow microreactor system. The study highlights the influence of precise temperature control and rapid mixing on enhancing reaction yield and selectivity. By optimizing conditions for aryllithium reagents bearing electrophilic functional groups and &#945;&#8208;keto esters, the system demonstrated superior performance over traditional batch methods. This method efficiently minimized byproduct formation, providing high yields and excellent selectivity for sterically hindered substrates. The flow microreactor thus offers an innovative platform for complex organometallic transformations.

         <title>In Situ Generation by Cyclization of an Organic Structure Directing Agent for the Synthesis of High Silica Zeolite ERS&#8208;7</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 30, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic route is established to high silica zeolite ERS&#8208;7 templated by a dimethylpyrrolidinium organic structure directing agent (OSDA) in the presence of a cationic polymer, both formed in situ from organic precursors. The polymer enables the cyclization that gives the OSDA and inhibits the crystallization of the competing zeolite mordenite.








Abstract
Zeolites with high framework Si/Al ratios are of interest for industrial applications due to their hydrothermal stability. They are usually synthesized in the presence of pre&#8208;prepared organic structure directing agents (OSDAs). The high silica ERS&#8208;7 zeolite (topology type ESV) can be crystallized using N,N&#8208;dimethylpyrrolidinium (dmpyrr) that is formed in situ via cyclization of N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diaminobutane (tmdab) when a cationic polymer is also present. The in situ generation of dmpyrr is demonstrated by solid&#8208;state 13C NMR spectroscopy and supported by both chemical analyses and comparative syntheses using pre&#8208;prepared dmpyrr. The cationic polymer inhibits the crystallization of mordenite, which is otherwise observed to be the favored product. The ERS&#8208;7 prepared via in situ dmpyrr synthesis (Si/Al = 14) is characterized by PXRD and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The CO2 adsorption seen for the H&#8208; and Na&#8208;forms indicates interactions with accessible Na+ cations. The synthetic studies indicate the potential for in situ generation of OSDAs to reduce the need for extended OSDA syntheses.

         <title>Glycan Covalent Targeting Chimera&#8208;Based T&#8208;Cell Glycoengineering for Boosting Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 30, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A T&#8208;cell glycoengineering strategy based on glycan covalent targeting chimera (gcTAC) is developed to improve immunotherapy. The gcTAC has two orthogonal glycan covalent binding functions and can orchestrate a cascade of interventions in T&#8211;tumor and tumor&#8211;NK intercellular glycan recognition, thereby effectively enhancing the cytotoxic effect of T&#8211;NK cell combination immunotherapy.








Abstract
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T&#8208;cell therapy is one of the most effective approaches in cancer immunotherapy. However, shortcomings such as loss of target antigens and poor infiltration remain in the treatment of solid tumors. Herein, we propose an approach to glycoengineer T cells based on glycan covalent targeting chimera (gcTAC), to enhance immunotherapy by modulating the glycan recognition behavior of T cells. We select hydrazide&#8208;modified phenylboronic acid (PBA) as gcTAC. The hydrazide group can covalently couple with the aldehyde group generated by the oxidation of galactose/N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine on the surface of T cells, while the PBA at the other end can specifically bind to sialic acids (Sia) of tumor cells, thereby enhancing the killing effect of T cells. At the same time, T cells covalently bound to tumor cells surfaces act as a blockade of Sia sites, which can disrupt the recognition between Siglec on natural killer (NK) cells and Sia on tumor cells, further enhancing the immune&#8208;killing effect of combined T&#8211;NK cell therapy. Our approach represents a novel concept to promote immune killing through cascading interventions in T&#8211;tumor and tumor&#8211;NK intercellular glycan recognition, thus providing a solution to the problem of immune escape in cancer therapy.

         <title>Singlet, Doublet, and Triplet Emissions of Diarylamine&#8208;Modified Bismuth Pincer Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 30, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversibly oxidizable diarylamine&#8208;modified phenyl&#8208;bis(dimethylaminomethyl) pincer bismuth complexes and their radical cations emit via excited singlet and triplet or doublet excited states at 77&#160;K in solvent matrices, in solution, or in the solid state.








Abstract
We present six bismuth complexes (NCRN)BiX2 (X = Cl, I) with diarylamine&#8208;modified pincer ligands (NCRN = (4&#8208;R&#8208;C6H4)2N&#8208;C6H2&#8208;(CH2NMe2)2&#8208;1,3; R&#160;=&#160;Me, O, NMe2) and report on their optoelectronic, photophysical, and electrochemical properties. The complexes exhibit intriguing photophysical behavior, with the p&#8208;tolyl and p&#8208;anisyl derivatives showing phosphorescence at 77 K in frozen solvent matrices and at room temperature (r.t.) in the solid state. In THF solutions at r.t., only ligand&#8208;based fluorescence is observed with strongly reduced quantum yields compared to free proligands NCHRN. Electrochemical studies reveal up to three reversible one&#8208;electron oxidations. The NMe2&#8208;substituted complexes display the lowest oxidation potentials and the largest number of redox waves. Radical cations [NCHNMe2N]+ and [(NCNMe2N)BiX2]+ are chemically stable and fluoresce weakly in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) at ca. 1200&#160;nm.

         <title>Click Conjugates of Artificial Ribonucleases: Sequence Specific Cleavage with Multiple Turnover</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 30, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trisbenzimidazole catalyst was attached to central positions of DNA and DNA&#8208;LNA oligonucleotides. The resulting conjugates bind complementary RNA strands and cleave them with multiple turnover and substrate half&#8208;lives down to 3.5&#160;hours. Up to 98.8% of cleavage occurs in a single site. The reaction does not depend on metal ions and also runs in the presence of EDTA.








Abstract
The azido modified RNA cleaving catalyst 2 has been attached to oligonucleotides containing alkyne linkers in a central position. The resulting conjugates hybridize specifically with complementary RNA strands and cleave them with multiple substrate turnover. RNA half&#8208;lives are in the range of 6&#8211;7&#160;hours (pH 8, 37 &#176;C). Some well&#8208;placed locked nucleic acid (LNA) nucleotides can further increase substrate affinities and reaction rates significantly (t&#189; of 3.5&#160;hours, kobs&#160;=&#160;0.20 h&#8722;1). RNA cleavage does not require metal ions and runs equally well in the presence of EDTA. Fragments of precisely defined lengths are formed, well suited for subsequent analysis by mass spectrometry and related bioanalytical techniques.

Four novel triple thia/sulfone[6]helicenes with C3 symmetry are synthesized via Scholl reaction and sulfonation. Their helical structures were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystal analysis. The sulfonation strategy can significantly improve fluorescence quantum yield of thia[6]helicenes.

         <title>Spin and Structural Dynamics of Persistent &#960;&#8208;Mer and &#960;&#8208;Dimer of a Tethered S,C,C&#8208;Bridged Triphenylamine Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 30, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Injection of electron spins into tethered dimer comprising two planar sulfur&#8208; and carbon&#8208;bridged triphenylamine units yields almost perfectly overlapping face&#8208;to&#8208;face close &#960;&#8208;stacking structures that have close S&#8211;S interatomic contacts. The mixed&#8208;valence radical cation (&#960;&#8208;mer) salt exhibits unique spin and structural dynamics.








Abstract
One&#8208; and two&#8208;electron&#8208;oxidized species of two &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems that adopt close &#960;&#8208;stacking structures are referred to as &#960;&#8208;mers and &#960;&#8208;dimers, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;Injection of electron spins into tethered dimer comprising two planar sulfur- and carbon-bridged triphenylamine units yields almost perfectly overlapping face-to-face close &#960;-stacking structures that have close S&#8211;S interatomic contacts. The mixed-valence radical cation (&#960;-mer) salt exhibits unique spin and structural dynamics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One- and two-electron-oxidized species of two &#960;-conjugated systems that adopt close &#960;-stacking structures are referred to as &#960;-mers and &#960;-dimers, respectively. These cationic species exhibit intriguing physicochemical properties that are markedly distinct from those of their parent monomeric radical cations. In this study, we have achieved the chemical oxidation of a newly designed tethered dimer comprising two planar sulfur- and carbon-bridged triphenylamine (SCBT) units linked by a 1,8-naphthalene moiety to obtain the corresponding &#960;-mer and &#960;-dimer as crystalline materials. Single-crystal x-ray diffraction analyses revealed that these cationic species adopt almost perfectly overlapping face-to-face close &#960;-stacking structures. As the degree of oxidation increases from the neutral form to the monocation and the dication, the interatomic S&#8211;-S distance decreases drastically from 5.35 to 3.03 &#197;. The injection of electron spins into the neutral species effectively induces covalent-like bonding interactions between the sulfur atoms and changes the degree of structural freedom of the molecule. The salt of the &#960;-mer exhibited an electrical conductivity of 1.9 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;6&lt;/sup&gt; S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature.

Abstract
A &#8220;butterfly&#8208;like&#8221; metal templated borate, [Co2(bpy)4(C2O4)]&#183;[B5O6(OH)4]2&#183;py2 (1, bpy&#160;=&#160;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine, py&#160;=&#160;pyridine), was synthesized via a solvothermal method. For the first time, the coordination of Co2+ ions with (C2O4)2&#8722; ions in borate systems was observed. Notably, upon pyrolyzing precursor compound 1, high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) revealed a catalyst with a carbon&#8208;supported Co nanocrystal structure, which significantly enhanced the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance, achieving a half&#8208;wave potential comparable to that of Pt/C. More importantly, the catalyst outperformed Pt/C when applied in a zinc&#8208;air battery.

         <title>Dense Li Deposition and Enhanced Flame&#8208;retardant Enabled by Localized Strong Ion&#8208;Dipole Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 30, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully designed a localized strong ion&#8208;dipole interactions&#8208;based electrolyte with solvation structure involving dual anions. The electrolyte not only exhibits excellent flame retardancy, but also forms a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) for dense Li deposition, which significantly improves the cycling life of Li metal batteries.








Abstract
Uncontrolled lithium (Li) deposition can lead to the formation of dendrites and &#8220;dead&#8221; Li, accelerating the degradation of cycling stability and safety performance in lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, we propose a strategy to achieve dense Li deposition and flame&#8208;retardant by designing an electrolyte based on localized strong ion&#8208;dipole (LSID) interactions. The strong ion&#8208;dipole interactions between the multiple&#8208;dipole solvent (G4), NO3&#8722;, FSI&#8722;, and Li+ promote the formation of Li+ primary solvation sheaths for stabilizing Li deposition behavior. While the weak dipole fluorine&#8208;containing diluent (TTE) is distributed in the secondary solvation sheath due to weak ion&#8208;dipole interactions of Li+&#8208;TTE to improve interfacial wettability and flame retardancy due to preferential separation. Consequently, the localized strong ion&#8208;dipole interactions strategy in the designed electrolyte successfully achieves a Coulombic efficiency of more than 99% for Li||Cu cells, and ultrathin Li&#8208;matched Li||LFP and Li||NCM523 cells also demonstrate excellent cycling stability, as well as an improved safety performance of LMBs.

         <title>Understanding the Properties of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Substituted Boron Difluoride 3&#8208;Cyanoformazanate Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 30, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron difluoride 3&#8208;cyanoformazanate dyes are easily synthesized and offer far red to near&#8208;IR emission properties despite their relatively simple structure. This work focuses on understanding these unexpected properties and shows that the electron poor boron difluoride formazanate core leads to these dyes operating outside of the traditional understanding of electronic structure augmentation upon substitution with donor and acceptor substituents.








Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated materials offer attractive traits including semiconductivity, low&#8208;energy light absorption/photoluminescence, and solution processability that render them ubiquitous within the organic electronics field. Among many strategies for property tuning, the creation of asymmetric electronic structures through the installation of donor and acceptor substituents commonly results in low&#8208;energy absorption/photoluminescence bands. Boron difluoride formazanate dyes are readily synthesized, can be asymmetrically substituted with donor and acceptor groups, and have unexpectedly low&#8208;energy absorption/photoluminescence bands that extend into the near&#8208;infrared. In this study, we prepared a series of donor&#8208;acceptor substituted boron difluoride 3&#8208;cyanoformazanate dyes and compared their properties to symmetric analogues. Our findings suggest that donor&#8208;acceptor derivatives are highly delocalized with properties intermediate of their symmetric counterparts. Furthermore, the data obtained suggest that the N&#8208;aryl substituents act as donors to the strongly accepting boron difluoride formazanate core, regardless of the functional groups appended to them. These properties were reproduced computationally, and while the frontier orbitals calculated for donor&#8208;acceptor dyes were modestly asymmetric, there was no evidence of charge&#8208;transfer character. This work provides significant insight into the unexpected properties of boron difluoride formazanates and reveals that their strongly accepting nature circumvents the predicted augmentation of electronic structure commonly observed for donor&#8208;accepter substituted dyes.

         <title>Stabilizing &#945;&#8208;MnO2 Tunnel Structure via Mo&#8211;Zn Synergistic Doping for Highly Efficient Zn2+ Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 30, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrothermal process is used for co&#8208;doping Mo and Zn into tunnel&#8208;structured MnO2 (MZMO), enhancing its ion diffusion kinetics and electrical conductivity by introducing impurity energy levels and generating oxygen vacancies. This co&#8208;doping strategy also stabilizes the MnO2 framework, enabling the MZMO cathode to achieve exceptional capacity, highly reversible H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;intercalation, and prolonged cycle life.








Abstract
To address the rising demand for eco&#8208;friendly and efficient energy storage devices, rechargeable aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) are emerging as a promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage. &#945;&#8208;MnO2 has attracted extensive attention for its open channels and exceptional Zn2+ storage capacity. However, the electrochemical performance of &#945;&#8208;MnO2 is significantly hindered by severe structural collapse and sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, we propose a simple hydrothermal approach for co&#8208;doping Mo and Zn into tunnel&#8208;structured MnO2 (MZMO). The ion diffusion kinetics of MZMO are optimized due to ameliorated electrical conductivity by doped cations and introduced oxygen vacancies within the MnO2 lattice.

&lt;p&gt;A hydrothermal process is used for co-doping Mo and Zn into tunnel-structured MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (MZMO), enhancing its ion diffusion kinetics and electrical conductivity by introducing impurity energy levels and generating oxygen vacancies. This co-doping strategy also stabilizes the MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; framework, enabling the MZMO cathode to achieve exceptional capacity, highly reversible H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; co-intercalation, and prolonged cycle life.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address the rising demand for eco-friendly and efficient energy storage devices, rechargeable aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) are emerging as a promising candidate for large-scale energy storage. &#945;-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has attracted extensive attention for its open channels and exceptional Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; storage capacity. However, the electrochemical performance of &#945;-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is significantly hindered by severe structural collapse and sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, we propose a simple hydrothermal approach for co-doping Mo and Zn into tunnel-structured MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (MZMO). The ion diffusion kinetics of MZMO are optimized due to ameliorated electrical conductivity by doped cations and introduced oxygen vacancies within the MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lattice. Moreover, Mo and Zn co-doping stabilizes the MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; framework, significantly enhancing its electrochemical performance during prolonged cycling. Charge storage mechanism analysis further validates the extraordinary stability of the MZMO phase structure during the Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; co-intercalation and deintercalation. The MZMO cathode demonstrates rapid and reversible Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; storage, with a high capacity of 395 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.2 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and the capacity remains at 136 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 1000 cycles at 2 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This study demonstrates Mo and Zn co-doping is an effective strategy to enhance the electrochemical performance of MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, offering valuable insights for developing other promising cathodes for AZIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Iminonitrile&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework Synthesized by Ehrlich&#8211;Sachs Reaction as a Promising Cathode for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

An &#945;&#8208;iminonitrile&#8208;linked COF (CityU&#8208;48) was prepared through a classic Ehrlich&#8211;Sachs reaction. When employed as a cathode material in sodium&#8208;ion batteries, CityU&#8208;48 delivered a discharge capacity of 139 mAh g&#8722;1 at the current density of 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Linkages represent the key feature to affect the properties of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), where chemical perturbation on the linkage microenvironment often leads to a remarkable impact on their applications. Following this strategy, we directly functionalized the imine linkage with a cyano group to form an &#945;&#8208;iminonitrile&#8208;linked COF (CityU&#8208;48) by employing a classic Ehrlich&#8211;Sachs reaction between tris&#8208;(4&#8208;nitrosophenyl) amine (TPA&#8208;3NO) and 1,4&#8208;phenylenediacetonitrile (Ph&#8208;2CN). However, this perturbation makes CityU&#8208;48 susceptible to crystallization due to the steric hindrance and polarity induced by extra cyano groups. By taking advantage of the bipolar redox&#8208;active nature, CityU&#8208;48 delivered a discharge capacity of 139 mAh g&#8722;1 at the current density of 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1 when employed as a cathode in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. These research efforts motivate the design of new linkages to explore their roles in COFs at the atomic level.

         <title>Highly Emissive Hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;benzocoronene&#8208;fluoranthene Hybrid as Easily Processable and Stable OLED Material</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 30, May 27, 2025. </description>

A &#8220;symmetry&#8208;broken&#8221; hexabenzocoronene&#8208;fluoranthene fluorescent dye was synthesized using an easily scalable reaction. Green emission at around 500&#160;nm, a maximum photoluminescence quantum yield of 67% in toluene, and high solubility in a wide range of solvents result from the distorted structure. A green organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) was fabricated without extensive optimization showcasing easy processability of the molecule class.








Abstract
We report the synthesis of a fluorescent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon dye with a &#8220;symmetry&#8208;broken&#8221; core, derived from the related hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;benzocoronene (HBC) core with a fluoranthene subunit. The fluorophore is composed of a pure carbon skeleton without heteroatoms and exhibits remarkable photoluminescence properties with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of up to 67% in toluene, exceeding that of the parent HBC by a factor of 30. The single crystal X&#8208;ray structure reveals the distorted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon structure, which is responsible for the optoelectronic properties, as supported by density functional theory calculations. We show that the new fluorescent dye can be readily used for the fabrication of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLED) without extensive optimization, whereby solubility in a variety of solvents and successful film formation are decisive.

In solution, these complexes exhibit a dynamic equilibrium involving continuous dissociation and reforming of phosphorus&#8208;metal bonds. This behavior was demonstrated by low&#8208;temperature 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy and corroborated by DFT calculations.

This behavior was demonstrated by low-temperature &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P{&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H} NMR spectroscopy and the conclusions were corroborated by DFT calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Endohedral Coordination of Bulky Substrates in Metalloenzyme&#8208;Like Organometallic Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 30, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organometallic nanotube with eight CuI ions mimics metalloenzyme behavior, featuring a flexible pore, metal&#8208;ligand substrate binding, and redox&#8208;active metals. Insertion of THF as a model substrate is driven by coordination, as confirmed by SC&#8208;XRD, NMR, and DFT. Electrochemical studies of a derived rotaxane reveal metal&#8208;centered redox activity.

Abstract
Artificial receptors inspired by metalloenzymes share three key properties: a structurally flexible cavity, substrate binding via metal&#8208;ligand coordination, and metal&#8208;based redox activity. Herein, we report an organometallic nanotube with such features based on our supramolecular pillarplex platform, incorporating eight CuI centers in its cavitand walls. The structurally adaptable cavity of this receptor enables the endohedral coordination of tetrahydrofuran (THF) as a hydrophilic model substrate with remarkable binding affinity despite a steric mismatch between the host and guest. Evidence from SC&#8208;XRD, 1H NMR titration in aqueous solution, and DFT modelling confirms that metal&#8208;ligand coordination governs substrate binding. Electrochemical analysis of a derived rotaxane reveals metal&#8208;centered redox activity.

         <title>Long&#8208;Lived Excimer&#8208;Like Emission From a &#960;&#8208;Stacked Trichromophore Comprising Perylene Monoimide and Perylene Diimide Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 30, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ground&#8208;state structure of the target trichromophore has the individual modules arranged in a parallel stack, with moderate excitonic coupling leading to a distorted absorption spectrum. Under illumination, the tripartite molecular arrangement shifts in favor of a bipartite system displaying broad excimer emission at room temperature. The dynamics for this structural displacement are monitored by transient spectroscopy.








Abstract
A trichromophore has been synthesized comprising a perylene diimide sandwiched between two perylene monoimide diester (PMIDE) units and held in place by xanthene spacers. The DFT computed structure indicates &#960;&#8208;stacking of the three polycycles, with a mean interplanar separation of 4.2&#258;, but with the central unit displaced sideways. Phenyl groups inserted between xanthene and perylene help to rigidify the structure. Electronic interactions between perylene polycycles splits the absorption spectrum, which is dominated by transitions to the upper&#8208;lying H&#8208;state. Excimer&#8208;like emission is observed in solution at room temperature, for which the lifetime is &#8776;22&#160;ns in toluene and &#8776;8&#160;ns in CH2Cl2. Transient absorption spectroscopy indicates the instantaneous formation of a Franck&#8208;Condon state, which undergoes rapid vibrational cooling to populate the low&#8208;lying J&#8208;state. This species transforms over 40&#8211;60&#160;ps into an excimer&#8208;like state wherein the exciton is delocalized over all three perylenes. A slower structural re&#8208;arrangement, complete within 1&#160;ns, minimizes electronic interactions with one of the PMIDE units and stabilizes the resultant bipartite excimer&#8208;like state.

Natural bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a fluorescent probe with clusterization&#8208;triggered emission (CTE) for detecting chlorpromazine hydrochloride (CPZ) and perphenazine (PPZ) by static fluorescence quenching. A rapid, anti&#8208;interference and cost&#8208;effective detection method was developed. This work opens an avenue for sustainable assay technologies by circumventing synthetic probe complexities and leveraging inherent biorecognition

Abstract
The development of rapid, cost&#8208;effective fluorescent probes for antipsychotic drug detection remains challenging due to the synthetic complexity of conventional probes and limited exploration of natural alternatives. Herein, we pioneered bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a natural clusterization&#8208;triggered emission (CTE) probe for one&#8208;step detection of chlorpromazine hydrochloride (CPZ) and perphenazine (PPZ). The unique CTE property of BSA displayed concentration&#8208;dependent quenching with CPZ and PPZ. Moreover, the quenching effect achieved balance within 5&#160;minutes and maintained stability for more than 30&#160;minutes. Based on these advantages, the proposed detection platform showed rapid response, operational simplicity, visual signal readout, wide detection range, ultra&#8208;low detection limits, compared with other methods. Moreover, the assay method exhibited excellent selectivity, facilitating satisfactory reliability for the real sample assay. Thermodynamic analyses revealed distinct interaction mechanisms between BSA and antipsychotics, both inducing static quenching by suppressing clusterization&#8208;induced electron transitions. Overall, this research not only develops a novel assay method for CPZ and PPZ, but also broadens the application potential of the CTE effect in natural biomacromolecules. As the first demonstration of natural CTE probes for antipsychotic detection, this work opens new frontiers for sustainable analytical technologies by circumventing synthetic probe complexities and leveraging inherent biorecognition.

         <title>Tuning of Thermal Back Reactivity of Aza&#8208;Diarylethene Photoswitches by Introducing Benzazole Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 30, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aza&#8208;diarylethenes bearing benzazole groups as nitrogen sources for 6&#960; azaelectrocyclization were synthesized, and their thermal back reactivity was investigated. Kinetic analysis revealed that the thermal back reaction half&#8208;lives (t&#8321;/&#8322;) at 293&#160;K largely depended on the type of benzazole group. Theoretical calculations clarified that the variation in thermal back reactivity approximately follows the change in the energy difference between open&#8208; and closed&#8208;ring isomers.








Abstract
Molecular photoswitches have attracted significant attention due to their potential applications in materials science and life science. In this study, we synthesize a series of aza&#8208;diarylethenes incorporating benzazole groups as the nitrogen atom source for 6&#960; azaelectrocyclization and investigate their photochromic behaviors. Compounds 1&#8211;3, bearing benzothiazole, benzoxazole, and benzimidazole groups, exhibit thermally reversible type photochromism with thermal back reaction half&#8208;lives (t1/2) ranging from milliseconds to seconds at 293&#160;K. Additional derivatives 4&#8211;6 with benzothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide at the ethene bridge moiety further expand the range of thermal back reactivity, with t1/2 values extending up to tens of minutes. Quantum chemical calculations confirm that the variation in thermal back reactivity is governed by the energy difference between open&#8208; and closed&#8208;ring isomers, in accordance with the Bell&#8722;Evans&#8722;Polanyi principle.

     alt="Tuning of Thermal Back Reactivity of Aza-Diarylethene Photoswitches by Introducing Benzazole Groups"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aza-diarylethenes bearing benzazole groups as nitrogen sources for 6&#960; azaelectrocyclization were synthesized, and their thermal back reactivity was investigated. Kinetic analysis revealed that the thermal back reaction half-lives (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&#8321;/&#8322;) at 293&#160;K largely depended on the type of benzazole group. Theoretical calculations clarified that the variation in thermal back reactivity approximately follows the change in the energy difference between open- and closed-ring isomers.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular photoswitches have attracted significant attention due to their potential applications in materials science and life science. In this study, we synthesize a series of aza-diarylethenes incorporating benzazole groups as the nitrogen atom source for 6&#960; azaelectrocyclization and investigate their photochromic behaviors. Compounds &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, bearing benzothiazole, benzoxazole, and benzimidazole groups, exhibit thermally reversible type photochromism with thermal back reaction half-lives (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;) ranging from milliseconds to seconds at 293&#160;K. Additional derivatives &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; with benzothiophene-&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-dioxide at the ethene bridge moiety further expand the range of thermal back reactivity, with &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; values extending up to tens of minutes. Quantum chemical calculations confirm that the variation in thermal back reactivity is governed by the energy difference between open- and closed-ring isomers, in accordance with the Bell&#8722;Evans&#8722;Polanyi principle. These findings provide a molecular design strategy for controlling the thermal back reactivity of aza-diarylethenes, enabling further development of functional photochromic materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Allosteric Differentiation of Al(I) Reactivity</title>

A dimeric potassium alumanyl reacts with phenyl&#8208;substituted alkynes to provide not only alkyne cycloaddition but also para&#8208;C&#8211;H activation of the phenyl substituent. Supported by a theoretical study, this outcome is judged to arise from a sequence of cooperative steps and a mode of kinetic discrimination that is suggested to be allosteric in origin.








Abstract
The dimeric potassium alumanyl, [{SiNDipp}AlK]2 ({SiNDipp} = {CH2SiMe2N(Dipp)}2; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3), reacts with two equivalents of PhC&#8801;CR (R = Ph or SiMe3) with the exclusive formation of the aluminacyclopropene derivatives, [{SiNDipp}Al{&#951;2&#8208;C2(R1)(R2)}]. In contrast, reactions with an equal stoichiometry of both alumanyl and alkyne reagents provide the products of not only alkyne cycloaddition but also para&#8208;C&#8211;H activation of a phenyl substituent. Supported by a theoretical study, this outcome is judged to result from a sequence of cooperative steps and the introduction of a modicum of kinetic discrimination that is suggested to be allosteric in origin.

Stepwise alkyne cyclotrimerizations were demonstrated at Os metal center. Paramagnetic osmacyclopentadiene complexes were the key intermediates and novel &#951;6&#8208;fluoranthene complexes of osmium were produced.








Abstract
Osmacyclopentadiene complexes were obtained from the reactions between OsCl2(PPh3)3 and 1,8&#8208;dialkynyl naphthalene compounds. These complexes exhibited paramagnetism as they adopted triplet ground states. Reactions of osmacyclopentadienes with alkynes were investigated, which produced novel &#951;6&#8208;fluoranthene complexes, showing their potential in organometallic synthesis.

         <title>Crystal Engineering of Cyanoborate&#8208;Bridged Cubane&#8208;Type Tetranuclear Ru Complex: Synthesis, Pseudopolymorphism, and Coordination Polymer Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 30, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal engineering of a cyanoborate&#8208;based cubane complex. A cubane&#8208;type tetranuclear Ru cage complex bridged by the B(CN)&#8324;&#8315; anion was synthesized via a simple photochemical reaction and yielded various pseudopolymorphs upon recrystallization. This complex was subsequently employed as a building block for the formation of coordination polymers.








Abstract
Cyanoborate anions are versatile bridging ligands that lead to structurally diverse compounds from a crystal engineering perspective. Herein, we report the synthesis of a cubane&#8208;type tetranuclear Ru complex, [Ru4(Cp)4{B(CN)4}4] (1, Cp = C5H5),&#160;obtained by photoirradiation of [Ru(Cp)(C6H6)]B(CN)4 in solution or by the reaction of [CpRu(MeCN)3]+ with KB(CN)4. This complex served as a host for various solvents, generating different pseudopolymorphs, including 1&#183;nCH2Cl2 (n = 1, 2, 3), 1&#183;0.5C6H6, 1&#183;C6H5Me, and 1&#183;3THF upon recrystallization. Moreover, the four free cyano groups in 1 allow it to act as a bridging ligand, facilitating the formation of 1D and 2D coordination polymers through reactions with transition metal complexes.

         <dc:description>
Herein, we report an effective soluble support&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;phase oligonucleotide synthesis using a novel tag, which can be successfully prepared from commercially available methyl gallate without column chromatography. Selective tag cleavages with protective groups remain are made possible under mild reducing conditions to prepare protected fragments, which is necessary to realize a convergent approach.








Abstract
Although soluble support (tag)&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;phase methods have found practical applications in peptide synthesis, they are still in their infancy for oligonucleotide synthesis. The development of techniques for selective tag cleavage with protective groups remaining is particularly important because such techniques are necessary to realize a convergent approach.

This article describes the synthesis, along with the full photophysical and computational characterization, of a series of push&#8208;pull boron complexes comprising a sterically hindered donor connected to a pyrimidine&#8208;based O^N^O boron chelate. Incorporation of the dimethylacridan derivative into an organic light&#8208;emitting diode led to the observation of intense electroluminescence, with EQEmax values reaching 9.7% at a 5 wt% doping concentration.








Abstract
This article describes the synthesis, along with the full photophysical and computational characterization, of a series of push&#8208;pull boron complexes comprising a sterically hindered donor connected to a pyrimidine&#8208;based O^N^O boron chelate. The dimethylacridan&#8208;functionalized fluorophore appears to be the most emissive in the series, both in toluene solution and in the solid state (as a powder), displaying thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emission in degassed media due to a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap. This result is in line with a previously reported pyridine analogue, which also exhibits delayed emission. Incorporation of this TADF compound into an organic light&#8208;emitting diode led to the observation of intense electroluminescence, with EQEmax values reaching 9.7% at a 5 wt% doping concentration.

         <title>Organic Cage Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of robust, amine&#8208;based organic cages with a controllable number of alkyne functional groups is described. Subsequent post&#8208;synthetic modification enabled installation of a defined number of rotaxane units on the external surfaces, resulting in changes to the physiochemical properties of the cages.








Abstract
Organic cages are a robust class of molecular hosts with a myriad of applications in materials science. Despite this, there has been a paucity of explorations into the modification of their properties via external functionalization. In this work, [n]rotaxanes featuring unoccupied organic cages as stopper components and a small 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine macrocycle were constructed using the active metal template (AMT) approach. By exploiting a scrambling methodology, it was possible to synthesize cages with a defined number of interlocked components (n = 2&#8211;4). The gas uptake, solubility, and thermal properties of the interlocked systems were compared against those of their constituent, non&#8208;interlocked components. In this manner, we were able to demonstrate the potential of exploiting the mechanical bond for modulating the physiochemical properties of these molecular materials.

         <title>Fluorescent Deferoxamine Complexes of Cu(II) and Zr(IV): Insights in the Development of Dual Imaging Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The insertion of a fluorescent coumarin unit by using a lysine&#8208;based linker on deferoxamine leads to a chelating agent (DFOKC), whose Cu(II) and Zr(IV) complexes can be used for both optical imaging and positron emission tomography. DFOKC shows increased binding ability for Cu(II) and Zr(II) and improved tumor cell internalization via pinocytosis.








Abstract
Deferoxamine (DFO) is widely regarded as benchmark chelator for 89Zr(IV), a commonly used PET (positron emission tomography) tracer. We have introduced a novel fluorescent coumarin derivative of DFO (DFOKC), characterized by chelating unit and fluorophore covalently linked via a lysine molecule. This design introduces a free primary amine group, which, in perspective, can be functionalized with biological vectors, potentially improving tumor tissue selectivity. Its acid&#8208;base and metal coordination properties toward Cu(II) and Zr(IV) ions were thoroughly characterized using UV&#8208;Vis and fluorescence emission spectroscopy. DFOKC strongly coordinates both metal ions, forming somewhat more stable complexes than DFO, while retaining fluorescence emission, thus enabling dual&#8208;mode optical and PET imaging. Biodistribution assays conducted on NIH&#8208;3T3 fibroblasts, and MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines demonstrated that the presence of primary amine groups favors Zr&#8208;DFOKC complex cell internalization via pinocytosis compared to the parent molecule DFOC, in which the fluorophore is linked to the amine group of DFO. Furthermore, crystal violet and MTT assays revealed no cytotoxic effects or mitochondrial impairment, even at concentrations higher than those typically used for radio&#8208;diagnostic applications. These results strongly support the potential of DFOKC as a versatile and promising tool for dual imaging, offering significant advantages in molecular imaging.

         <title>Pyridyl/Phenyl&#8208;Appended Acrylonitrile &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Molecules: Thermally Stable Organic Crystals for Amplified Spontaneous Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized t&#8208;butyl&#8208; and pyridyl/phenyl&#8208;substituted CDSBs, forming emissive crystals via solution processing. Pyridyl groups influenced the crystal structure and enhanced thermal stability through hydrogen bonding, enabling ASE under intense laser irradiation. This highlights pyridyl modification as a strategy for stable, solid&#8208;state laser materials.








Abstract
Highly solid&#8208;state emissive molecular crystals have attracted attention as gain media for organic lasers. There is a need to develop solid&#8208;state luminescent molecules with excellent solubility and thermal stability through chemical design approaches despite the structural and functional diversity of organic molecular materials toward such media. Here, we report the synthesis and properties of the t&#8208;butyl&#8208; and pyridyl or phenyl&#8208;appended cyano&#8208;&#946;&#8208;substituted distyrylbenzenes (CDSBs). A solution process at room temperature could prepare each crystal of these molecules modified with pyridyl/phenyl. The crystal structure analysis results suggest that the difference in the pyridyl/phenyl group affects the crystal system. Solid&#8208;state emissions were similar due to the molecular structural differences affecting only the crystal structure. The emission spectrum of the crystal exhibited amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) properties with the formation of population inversion. However, the pyridyl&#8211;pyridyl interactions contributed to the thermal stability of the crystal, which was stable even under high&#8208;energy density laser irradiation. Therefore, molecular modification with the pyridyl group offers a new strategy for controlling crystal structures and rigid frameworks.

         <title>Bifunctional Chiral ImPy&#8208;Carbene Ligands. H&#8208;Bonding Controlled Reactivity and Enantioselectivity in Au(I)&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of catalytically highly efficient bifunctional imidazopyridine (ImPy)&#8208;based gold(I) complexes was synthesized. The ligands are based on tetrahedral C&#8208;stereogenic centers derived from straightforward chiral pool synthesis. Unprecedented cycloisomerization products of 1,6&#8208;enynols were observed in excellent enantioselectivity up to 99:1 er. DFT calculations were utilized for intricate mechanistic investigations.








Abstract
Bifunctional chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands have been devised for enantioselective gold(I) catalysis. Based on a single C&#8208;stereogenic center derived from chiral pool &#945;&#8208;aminoacids and connecting an imidazopyridine core to an arylurea motif, enantioselective gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization reactions could be achieved. High enantioselectivities were notably observed for substrates presenting a pendant propargyl alcohol on 2&#8208;naphthol and 1,6&#8208;enyne scaffolds. In the latter case, the catalyst shows a high degree of selectivity for the unprecedented 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig biscyclization of these substrates to give cyclopropyl&#8208;fused 6&#8208;ring heterocycles with a free OH functionality instead of the previously reported furan&#8208;fused products. This unusual selectivity was investigated by DFT studies, which suggested the dual role of the carbonyl group of the urea moiety: first as an H&#8208;bond acceptor in the catalytic cycle to direct the enantioselectivity and second as a cooperative group in the hydrogen shift leading to deauration.

This study presents a strategy to synergistically enhance iodine capture by flexible cyclictriphosphonitrile&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks(COFs) (CTP&#8208;X&#8208;COF, X&#160;= PDA, ODA, BPY, DPT). The adsorption capacities of CTP&#8208;PDA&#8208;COF, CTP&#8208;ODA&#8208;COF, CTP&#8208;BPY&#8208;COF, and CTP&#8208;DPT&#8208;COF for iodine vapor are 4.65&#160;g&#160;g&#8722;1, 4.18 g g&#8722;1, 2.38 g g&#8722;1, and 3.57 g g&#8722;1, respectively.








Abstract
The development of highly efficient materials for trapping radioactive iodine is essential for the safe use of nuclear energy. Herein, we present a strategy to synergistically enhance iodine capture by exploiting the flexible building blocks with the affinity properties of electrically rich heteroatoms by combining the cyclic triphosphonitrile derivative with amine linkers of different molecular lengths and constructing triangular pore&#8208;structured flexible cyclotriphosphonitrile&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks. A series of cyclotriphosphonitrile&#8208;based COFs (CTP&#8208;X&#8208;COF, X&#160;= PDA, ODA, BPY, DPT) with triangular pore topology were synthesized using CTP&#8208;6 as the node and connection point of p&#8208;phenylenediamine (PDA), 4,4&#8208;diaminodiphenyl ether (ODA), 5,5&#8208;diamino2,2&#8208;bipyridine (BPY), and 4,4&#8208;diaminotribiphenyl (DPT) with different molecular lengths. It was found that the adsorption capacities of CTP&#8208;PDA&#8208;COF, CTP&#8208;ODA&#8208;COF, CTP&#8208;BPY&#8208;COF, and CTP&#8208;DPT&#8208;COF for iodine vapor were 4.65&#160;g g&#8722;1, 4.18&#160;g g&#8722;1, 2.38&#160;g g&#8722;1, and 3.57&#160;g g&#8722;1, respectively. The results showed that the adsorption capacities of CTP&#8208;PDA&#8208;COF, CTP&#8208;ODA&#8208;COF, CTP&#8208;BPY&#8208;COF, and CTP&#8208;DPT&#8208;COF for iodine in cyclohexane were 281.50&#160;mg g&#8722;1, 221.67&#160;mg g&#8722;1, 161.14&#160;mg g&#8722;1, and 222.67&#160;mg g&#8722;1, respectively. It was found that the four COFs adsorbed iodine in cyclohexane solution was a mixed adsorption process with chemical adsorption playing a predominant role and physical adsorption as an auxiliary mechanism.

         <title>Revealing the Origin of Emission Quenching on Trivalent Europium &#946;&#8208;Diketonate Complex Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We uncover the key quenching mechanism in Eu(III) &#946;&#8208;diketonate complex NPs: coordinated water molecules enhance interactions with external water, accelerating nonradiative deactivation. While aggregation&#8208;induced quenching is minimal, Eu(III) complexes without phenyl groups show enhanced concentration quenching. triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO) ligation significantly stabilizes luminescence, highlighting ligand design as crucial for optimizing emission in aqueous environments.








Abstract
Eu(III) complex nanoparticles (NPs) prepared via reprecipitation exhibit characteristic emission in aqueous solutions without amphiphilic substituents, making them promising for bioimaging applications. However, although it is well established that water efficiently quenches emissions of Eu(III) complexes, reported emission quantum yields of water&#8208;soluble Eu(III) complex NPs vary significantly among studies, and the factors governing these emission properties have yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we systematically investigated the emission quenching mechanisms of Eu(III) &#946;&#8208;diketonate complex NPs by time&#8208;resolved absorption and emission spectroscopies. We found that the primary pathway is the interaction between coordinated and external water molecules, which strongly enhances nonradiative deactivation. Notably, coordinated water facilitates stronger interactions with the surrounding water, further promoting quenching. Additionally, we also found that aggregation causes emission quenching in Eu(III) complexes lacking phenyl groups in the &#946;&#8208;diketonate moiety, which have smaller molecular volumes. These findings clarify the origin of luminescence variability in Eu(III) complex&#160;NPs and provide a foundation for rational material design to enhance luminescence stability in aqueous environments.

         <title>In Situ X&#8208;ray Diffraction Studies on the Reduction of U3O8 by Various Reducing Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reduction of U&#8323;O&#8328; by hydrogen, PVDF, and CaH&#8322; is investigated using continuous in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction. Phase transitions, oxygen loss, and intermediate structures are analyzed. The study elucidates how different reducing environments influence reaction pathways and final products, offering new insight into uranium oxide chemistry relevant to nuclear material processing.








Abstract
In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction studies were conducted to elucidate the reduction pathways of U3O8 using various reducing agents, including hydrogen, the fluorinating agent polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and calcium hydride (CaH2). The reduction processes were characterized by a transition from the orthorhombic, pseudo&#8208;hexagonal phase &#945;&#8208;U3O8 to the hexagonal polymorph, followed by the formation of fluorite&#8208;type UO2+x phases. The reduction temperature and intermediate phases vary with the type of reducing agent, though they all follow a similar sequence of phases. In the presence of pure hydrogen and upon reaction with PVDF and CaH2, U3O8 transformed entirely into fluorite&#8208;type phases UO2+x. By decreasing the chemical potential of hydrogen via its partial pressure, the behavior of U3O8 preceding the reduction to UO2+x can be switched from an orthorhombic&#8208;to&#8208;hexagonal phase transition followed by disproportionation to two different U3O8 phases, presumably with different oxygen content, to a continuous oxygen loss within one U3O8 phase without prior phase transition. The detailed analysis of lattice parameters and phase transformations in the course of the investigated reactions offers insights into the reduction pathways of uranium oxides, highlighting the impact of different reducing environments on the reaction pathways and final products.

         <title>Rational Design of a Deep&#8208;Red Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission&#8208;Active Iridium Complex for Plant Cell Wall Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aggregation&#8208;induced emission&#8208;active, deep&#8208;red emissive iridium complex (Ir&#8208;CW) is designed to specifically stain plant cell walls. Ir&#8208;CW shows selective binding to pectin through electrostatic interactions between pyridinyl groups and carboxylic groups and lights up plant cell walls in high resolution, significantly expanding the use of iridium complexes as powerful tools for botanical studies.








Abstract
Plant cell wall imaging has received consistent attention in characterizing and monitoring the structure and health of plant tissues. To overcome current drawbacks of plant cell wall staining, such as source limitations, low specificity, and auto&#8208;fluorescence interference, in this work, we present the rational design of an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active, deep&#8208;red emissive iridium complex as a specific staining agent of plant cell walls. Cell wall probe [Ir(dpyb)2(iqbtz)]+ (Ir&#8208;CW), bearing two rotatable pyridyl moieties, is designed for selective binding to pectin, one of the major components of the cell wall that carries rich carboxylic residues on its polymer chain. The AIE properties, pectin sensing behaviors, pectin binding mechanism, and practical application of cell wall staining of Ir&#8208;CW are performed. Results demonstrate that Ir&#8208;CW exhibits pectin&#8208;responsive AIE properties and selective pectin binding against common interfering species, including metal ions, anions, amino acids, proteins, and saccharides. Notably, Ir&#8208;CW can specifically stain plant cell walls with better performance than Congo red, a commercial cell wall staining agent. This work highlights the rationales of developing novel iridium complexes for cell wall staining and widely broadening their applications as powerful tools for botanical studies.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical modification of biomolecules is an emerging technique for studying and manipulating biological mechanisms. Among these methodologies, catalysis offers advantages over stoichiometric strategies due to its ability to enhance selectivity, e.g., spatiotemporal control, via catalytic turnover, and the modification of tyrosine recently attracts considerable attention due to its significant biological functions. However, catalyst&#8208;controlled aromatic halogenation is challenging under near&#8208;physiological conditions due to the lack of biocompatible catalysts, despite the potential of tyrosine bromination as an attractive biomolecular labeling technique. In this study, inspired by the bioorthogonal reactivity of cyclic olefins, we developed catalytic aromatic bromination via the transfer of a bromenium ion from olefins to aromatic substrates based on the in&#8208;situ generation of bromiranium ions as active species. Bifunctional cyclooctenes bearing a hydroxybenzyl group efficiently catalyzed the bromination of phenol derivatives, which was applicable in tyrosine modification. The substituent effects of the catalysts primarily affected the rate of the generation of bromiranium ions, which provided the kinetics enabling light&#8208;gated catalysis that could be activated in situ via the photochemical deprotection of the hydroxybenzyl group. Such olefin catalysis was compatible with aqueous conditions, enabling the bromination of peptides, and the Lewis&#8208;base catalysis of the olefins proceeded even under acidic conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Bispidine&#8208;Based Copper(II) Coordination Polymers with Remarkable Dynamic Properties, Selective Volatile Organic Compounds Adsorption, and Exchange Capabilities</title>

Novel bispidine&#8208;based Cu(II) CPs show remarkable selective VOC adsorption and 1D to 2D transformations.








Abstract
This study presents novel bispidine&#8208;based Cu(II) coordination polymers (CPs) with remarkable dynamic properties, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) exchange, and selective adsorption capabilities. The coordination requirements of Cu(II) enable, as demonstrated by SC&#8208;XRD and Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (P&#8208;XRD), the formation of either 1D ribbon&#8208;like (1&#8208;TCMSC and 1&#8208;H2OSC) or 2D (1&#8208;MeCNSC) extended frameworks depending on the ability of the trapped solvents to interact as hydrogen bond (HB) donor with the metal's counterion. Hirshfeld Surface (HS) analysis and in situ VT SC&#8208; and P&#8208;XRD experiments reveal different interchain interactions in 1D vs 2D CPs. Solvent exchange experiments on both single crystals (SCs) and microcrystalline samples, set up to evaluate differences in the CPs&#8217; dynamic nature, confirm the drastic effect of CP dimensionality. Additionally, an amorphous desolvated phase 1&#8208;AmorphPwd was tested for VOC adsorption and demonstrated to display affinity for acetonitrile and nitromethane, with high selectivity for the latter, but also to have the ability to trap aromatic VOCs, capturing up to ca. 2&#160;mmol/g of solvent. The adsorption experiments, conducted at r.t., 1 atm, and no prior activation, underscore the potential of these materials for environmental and industrial applications. This work emphasizes the unique dynamic and selective behavior of bispidine&#8208;based CPs and provides a foundation for their scalability and practical implementation in VOCs capture technologies.

         <title>Recyclable, Biobased Polycarbonates and Polyesters by Naphthoxy&#8208;Imine Zinc and Magnesium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc and magnesium complexes, like skilled composers, craft polymeric symphonies by orchestrating diverse combinations of monomers. Once their performance is complete, the polymers gracefully can be decomposed back into their original monomers, ready to be composed into new symphonies.








Abstract
Naphthoxy&#8208;imine pyridine zinc and magnesium complexes were synthesized and fully characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). In the presence of an alcohol as initiator, both complexes promoted the ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of L&#8208;lactide (L&#8208;LA), &#949;&#8208;caprolactone (&#949;&#8208;CL), &#946;&#8208;butyrolactone (&#946;&#8208;BL), trimethylene carbonate (TMC), and 1&#8208;methyl trimethylene carbonate (Me&#8208;TMC), which was purposely synthesized from CO2 and the appropriate diol. The zinc complex exhibited notably high activity, particularly in the polymerization of lactide and TMC, and was subsequently employed in the synthesis of polytrimethylene carbonate&#8208;based diblock and random copolymers with both &#949;&#8208;CL and L&#8208;LA. Furthermore, the zinc complex demonstrated its ability to close the life cycle of the synthesized materials by successfully depolymerizing both polytrimethylene carbonate (PTMC) and its copolymers.

         <title>Nonconventional Silicon&#8208;Hybrid Luminophores of Hyperbranched Polymer: Fluorescence Regulation and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The excellent luminescent properties of nonconventional polymer materials have attracted broad attention. In this paper, we systematically review the nonconjugated luminescence mechanism and multicolor tunable optical properties of nonconventional polymers&#8208;hyperbranched polysiloxanes (HBPSi) and their derivatives, explore the role of molecular engineering strategies in promoting their luminescent properties and biocompatible functionalization, and look forward to the potential of their applications in bioimaging and other fields. 








Abstract
Hyperbranched polysiloxanes are a class of nonconventional polymers with unique structural features and excellent physicochemical properties, which have attracted great attention in the field of luminescent materials. This review summarizes the recent progress in the study of luminescence mechanisms and optical properties of various hyperbranched polymers containing Si&#9472;O&#9472;C segments with Si as branching points, including hyperbranched polysiloxanes, hyperbranched polyborosiloxanes, and hyperbranched polysilphosphates. Through molecular design and structural regulation, researchers have successfully achieved multicolor fluorescence and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence emission ranging from blue to red in these polymers, with quantum yields reaching up to 54.1% and fluorescence lifetimes up to 9.73 &#181;s. The AIE properties and excellent biocompatibility of these polymers provide new materials and strategies for applications in bioimaging, controlled drug release, information security encryption, and ion detection. Moreover, the opportunities and challenges for further development are briefly discussed.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Precise Synthesis of Non&#8208;Hexagonal Ring&#8208;Embedded Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced on&#8208;surface synthesis enables fabrication of non&#8208;hexagonal ring&#8208;embedded graphene nanoribbons via four principal strategies: Ullmann coupling followed by cyclodehydrogenation, [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition, lateral fusion reactions, and skeletal rearrangement.








Abstract
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), as quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional carbon nanostructures, combine the exceptional properties of graphene with tunable bandgaps. The incorporation of periodic non&#8208;hexagonal ring motifs into GNR frameworks offers an effective approach to significantly tailor their electronic and magnetic properties. However, synthesis of GNRs incorporating non&#8208;hexagonal rings remains challenging, due to the thermodynamic instability compared to their hexagonal counterparts. Advancements in on&#8208;surface synthesis and in&#8208;situ characterization techniques have emerged as powerful methods for the atomically precise fabrication of novel carbon nanostructures. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the recent progress in on&#8208;surface synthesis of non&#8208;hexagonal ring&#8208;embedded GNRs via sophisticated design of precursors and optimized reaction pathways. This review aims to provide insights into strategies for constructing carbon polygons into nanostructures via surface&#8208;mediated chemical reactions, thereby enabling their multifunctional applications in electronics and spintronics.

         <title>Effect of Chalcogen Interaction on the Structure of Methine&#8208;Bridged Trichalcogenophenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polythienylenemethylidenes (PTMs) are promising conjugated polymers for organic electronics owing to their narrow bandgaps and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation. However, their stereochemistry remains unexplored. In this study, methine&#8208;bridged trithiophene and trifuran analogs were synthesized to investigate stereochemistry and chalcogen bonding effects. The compounds were obtained as mixtures of ZZ, EZ(=ZE), and EE geometric isomers, established through detailed NMR analyses. At thermal equilibrium, the ZZ isomer predominated in trithiophene (ZZ:(EZ+ZE):EE = 58:35:6), whereas trifuran showed a near&#8208;statistical distribution. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed intramolecular S&#183;&#183;&#183;S chalcogen bonding in trithiophene with S&#183;&#183;&#183;S distances (&#8776;3.04 &#197;) shorter than van der Waals radii and C&#8211;S&#183;&#183;&#183;S angles of 171&#176;. Comprehensive conformer searches and DFT calculations not only validated the higher stability of the ZZ isomer in trithiophene but also provided calculated isomer distributions that closely matched the experimental values. Multi&#8208;faceted computational analysis (ELF, NCI, QTAIM, and NBO) confirmed the presence of these chalcogen&#8208;centeredinteractions and quantified their strength through lone pair LP(S)&#8594;&#963;*(S&#8211;C) donor&#8208;acceptor orbital interactions. Trithiophene exhibited a unique dual&#8208;chalcogen bonding mode in the ZZ configuration. These findings elucidate the role of chalcogen bonding in stabilizing ZZ&#8208;trithiophenes and contribute to designing PTMs with controlled stereochemistry for organic electronics applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Chirality in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of chirality in inorganic nanostructures has a critical impact on the properties and potential applications of these novel nanomaterials. This work presents a critical collection of examples of the observation of chirality in TMDs, covering different synthetic procedures and origins of chirality as well as a broad range of dimensionality from 0D dots to complex 3D nanostructures.








Abstract
The fascinating properties introduced by the breaking of mirror symmetry have recently motivated a rising interest in chirality in nanomaterials. In particular, transition metal (TM) dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a wide group of technologically relevant 2D layered materials where recent efforts in the introduction of chirality have shown promising results, attracting great attention for future studies and potential applications. This review article is focused on the development of chirality in TM dichalcogenide nanostructures, dealing with the synthetic strategies that have been adopted to produce chiral TMDs both via solution&#8208;phase and vapor&#8208;phase syntheses along with the characterization of their chiroptical properties. A broad range of examples, including a variety of nanostructures such as 0D quantum dots (QDs), 1D nanotubes, 2D flakes, and more complex 3D nanostructures as well as different origins of chirality are considered. Critical analysis of potential pitfalls in the assessment of the materials&#8217; chirality are discussed. A broad range of exciting properties and applications associated with the materials&#8217; chirality, including: nanomedicine, enantioselective catalysis, spin&#8208;dependent electrocatalysis, spintronics, and nonlinear optics, are also presented in the review.

         <title>Size&#8208;Dependent Ultrafast UV Photochemistry of Aliphatic Disulfides in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aliphatic disulfides exclusively split homolytically along the S&#8722;S bond when directly exciting the disulfide chromophore at about 250&#8197;nm. Ultrafast (&lt;1&#8197;ps) geminate recombination at high yield is observed in solution for fragment sizes as small as L&#8208;cysteine. The smallest disulfide recombines ten&#8208;fold more slowly. Ultrafast disulfide reformation will also exist in proteins, providing inherent protection from radiation damage.







Abstract
We have investigated the photochemistry of dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) in solution upon ultraviolet (UV) excitation in comparison to L&#8208;cystine by femtosecond X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy at the sulfur K&#8208;edge. For these aliphatic disulfides, the very similar differential absorption spectra reveal unequivocally a pair of geminate thiyl radicals as the single primary reaction product with a formation time constant of about 100&#8197;fs. We find size&#8208;dependent majority yields for disulfide recombination with DMDS reforming ten&#8208;fold slower and at lower quantum yield than L&#8208;cystine while GSSG recombines even faster than L&#8208;cystine at a yield of nearly 80&#8201;% within 2&#8197;ps after excitation. We attribute the much lower recombination rates and yields of DMDS to larger product separation after homolytic S&#8722;S bond cleavage due to the smaller thiyl radical mass and correspondingly larger mutual acceleration. Furthermore, we observe the delayed formation of at least one additional reaction product for these disulfides that we attribute to perthiyl radicals. The ultrafast recombination of L&#8208;cystine and GSSG at majority yield in condensed phase suggests a dynamic S&#8722;S bond integrity which may be exploited in natural systems to mitigate UV radiation damage, and which could be of interest in materials design.

         <title>Oxidative Dehydrogenation of N&#8208;Heteroaromatic Alkyl Alcohols and Amines Facilitated by Dearomative Tautomerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxidation of alcohols, amines, and halides is a fundamental transformation in organic chemistry with significant applications in the synthesis of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and natural products. Here we show that a broad variety of N&#8208;heteroarenes bearing hydroxymethyl, aminomethyl, or halomethyl groups are oxidatively dehydrogenated to their respective aldehydes by simply heating them in acidic or basic aqueous solution under ambient atmosphere. The quantitative oxidation of 9&#8208;acridinemethanol to 9&#8208;acridinecarboxaldehyde serves as an illustrative example, proceeding to completion within 3 h in refluxing 5% aqueous acetic acid or even household vinegar. Quinoline derivatives may be similarly oxidized but require higher temperatures and longer reaction times, while indole derivatives are oxidized under basic conditions. Based on comprehensive regioselectivity screens, internal kinetic isotope competition, and density functional theory calculations, we propose a mechanism in which migration of a methylene hydrogen to the pyridinic nitrogen by acid&#8208;catalyzed dearomative tautomerization yields an unstable enol or enamine intermediate that then irreversibly loses two hydrogen atoms to atmospheric oxygen. In addition to the simplicity and environmentally benign nature of our method, we observe no indication of any over&#8208;oxidation to carboxylic acids. Finally, we demonstrate the synthetic utility of this reaction through two different one&#8208;pot formylations of acridine.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic disulfide bonds offer a promising avenue for developing robust and reversible photocatalysts. This study introduces a novel polymer, Poly&#8208;SS, designed for heterogeneous thiyl radical photocatalysis, leveraging the dynamic nature of disulfide linkages. Poly&#8208;SS features linear disulfide&#8208;containing polymers grafted onto a polyvinyl backbone, combining the photoactivity of disulfide with the structural integrity of polyvinyl. This design facilitates efficient thiyl radical generation upon photoirradiation, enabling challenging organic transformations. Poly&#8208;SS demonstrates the exceptional photocatalytic efficiency for the aerobic oxidation of diarylalkynes to 1,2&#8208;diketones, achieving &gt;99% conversion. The polyvinyl backbone plays a crucial role in maintaining polymer recyclability by promoting thiyl radical recombination and preserving disulfide linkages, addressing the inherent lability of molecular thiyl radicals. Furthermore, copolymerization with soluble monomer enhances the solubility of Poly&#8208;SS, enabling facile thin&#8208;film fabrication for diverse photoreactor designs. This work highlights a significant advancement in heterogeneous thiyl radical photocatalysis, showcasing the potential of carefully designed disulfide&#8208;linked polymers to overcome limitations associated with traditional molecular catalysts by integrating dynamic covalent chemistry with a robust polymer architecture.</dc:description>

         <title>Innovative Cyclic Nucleotides &#8208; Nucleoside 2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;Seven Membered Cyclic Diphosphonate Derivatives. Theoretical Feasibility, Synthesis, and Properties</title>

         <dc:description>7&#8208;membered cyclic nucleotides have remained unknown despite the natural abundance of their 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered counterparts. Here, we report the first synthesis of 2',3'&#8208;cyclic nucleosides (tetrathio)diphosphonate (2',3'&#8208;cNTDPs) by a rapid one&#8208;step, regioselective, and protection&#8208;free reaction of U, A, C, I, and G, with methylene&#8208;bis(1,3,2&#8208;dithia&#8208;phospholane&#8208;2&#8208;sulfide) (DTPS). The reaction proceeds instantaneously, even at &#8208;35 &#176;C, resulting in the quantitative conversion of methylene&#8208;bis&#8208;DTPS. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of &#8710;Gr confirm the synthetic feasibility and regioselectivity, attributing the efficiency to strain release in DTPS rings and entropic gain from thiirane elimination. The resulting 2',3'&#8208;cNTDPs exhibited remarkable hydrolytic stability and greater solution structural rigidity than free nucleosides.</dc:description>

         <title>The Dugganite Structure as a Host for New Colored Compounds and for Oxygen Evolution Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transition metal substituted dugganite compounds were explored toward new colored compounds and as an electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reactions. The compounds were also investigated for their second harmonic generation and dielectric behavior at room temperature. The theoretical calculations support the findings of experimental investigations.








Abstract
A family compounds with the general formula A3BC3D2O14 (A&#160;=&#160;Pb, Ba, Sr; B&#160;=&#160;Te, Sb; C&#160;=&#160;Al, Ga, Fe, Zn, Mg, Co, Ni, Cu; D&#160;=&#160;P, V, As, Si, Ge) stabilized in the dugganite structure has been prepared and characterized. The transition metal ions substituted at the tetrahedral sites in place of Zn2+ ions, gave rise to brightly colored compounds. The origin of colors in the compounds were understood based on the allowed d&#8208;d transitions and possible metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (MMCT) transitions involving the different transition elements. The white compounds exhibited good near infrared (NIR) reflectivity as well as deep UV&#8211;cut off (85&#8211;90%), which indicates possible use as UV&#8208;NLO materials. The compounds exhibited reasonable second harmonic generation (SHG) activity with values that are 3&#8211;5 times higher than KDP. The dielectric studies indicated reasonable values for the dielectric constant with low dielectric loss. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) studies on Pb3TeCo3V2O14 and Pb3Te(Co2Fe)(VSi)O14, exhibited good OER behavior in alkaline medium with long&#8208;term stability. The change in the band gap values for the transition metal substituted compounds were understood through density functional theory calculations, which support the findings of the experimental investigations. The present study clearly indicates that it is profitable to explore mineral structures as hosts toward new colored compounds, substitution of transition elements that result not only in new and also for application as electrocatalysts through careful band engineering.

         <title>Dextran&#8208;Assisted Biomimetic Fabrication of CdSe:Eu QDs With Enhanced Biocompatibility and Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dextran&#8208;templated CdSe:Eu quantum dots were synthesized and coated with citrate or APTES to enhance stability and reduce cytotoxicity. Structural, optical, and biological evaluations demonstrated their potential for cellular imaging and theragnostic applications.








Abstract
A dextran templated biomimetic synthetic approach was applied for the preparation of Cadmium Selinium:Europium Quantum Dots (CdSe:Eu QDs). The present work examines synthetic variables including the effect of increasing Europium concentration during QDs&#8217; synthesis and the use of different coating agents (citrate versus APTES) to improve the QDs' colloidal stability and ameliorate their cytotoxic behavior. All samples were subjected to structural and morphological characterizations via Fourier Transform infrared (FT&#8208;IR) spectroscopy, UV&#8211;Visible (UV&#8208;Vis) spectrophotometry, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). Subsequently, biological evaluation of all the synthesized samples of bare and APTES coated CdSe:Eu QDs was conducted on epithelial HaCaT and breast cancer MCF&#8208;7. Wound healing assays were conducted to assess cytotoxicity and cell migration under QD treatment. Results showed that both coated and uncoated QDs influenced wound closure rates in a concentration&#8208; and time&#8208;dependent manner. Finally, fluorescence microscopy revealed significant green luminescence of CdSe:Eu quantum dots (QDs) in both HaCaT and MCF&#8208;7 cell lines, indicating efficient cellular uptake. The internalization of QDs was influenced by their surface properties and charge, suggesting an endocytic uptake pathway.

         <title>Strategy&#8208;Level Prodrug Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prodrug approaches can be expanded by increasing options for controlling site&#8208;selective functionalization, boosting the range of linking groups, and enhancing the chemoselectivity of reactive group incorporation. This Concept describes strategy&#8208;level prodrug synthesis, whereby these issues are addressed at an early stage of a sequence. New reactions that facilitate this approach and the biological results of the resulting products are highlighted.








Abstract
Organic synthesis uniquely provides opportunities to access molecules that serve defined purposes. Medicinal chemistry illustrates this attribute well with prodrug design, whereby a drug undergoes a late&#8208;stage conversion to a conditionally responsive active medicinal agent (AMA), being a notable example. Prodrugs are becoming increasingly important in medicinal chemistry but common approaches to introduce biologically responsive groups are limited in the chemoselectivity and scope of available functionalization reactions. This Concept article describes strategy&#8208;level prodrug synthesis, which is a powerful extension of classical prodrug formation that initiates sequences with the objective of introducing functionality early in a sequence to achieve greater scope, site&#8208;selectivity, and chemoselectivity for the incorporation of the biologically responsive group. Examples of functionalization using alkyne hydroamination, Curtius reaction, and alkene metathesis are highlighted along with the use of the prodrugs for biological applications.

         <title>Functionalization, Fragmentation, and Expansion of cyclo&#8208;P4R2 Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three isolobal transition metal (TM) units are demonstrated to impact the transformation of coordinated P4 ligands in different ways. The observed reactivity primarily depends on the nature of the TM, an effect so far underexplored in phosphorus chemistry. This in&#8208;depth analysis shines light on the underlying mechanistic principles and exploits them to access a plethora of unprecedented fully functionalized polyphosphorus compounds.








Abstract
In this study, three isolobal complexes of the form [{LnM}(&#951;3&#8208;P4R2)]+ ({LnM}&#160; = {CpMo(CO)2} (A), {Cp'''Ni} (B), {Cp'''Co}&#8211; (C), R = Ph, iPr; Cp''' = 1,2,4&#8208;tBu3C5H2) are reacted with nucleophilic carbenes (L). While C does not show any reactivity, the cationic complexes A and B undergo addition reactions. The respective products [CpMo(CO)2(&#951;3&#8208;P4R2L)]+ (1a &#8211; d) and [Cp'''Ni(&#951;1:1&#8208;P4R2L)]+ (3a &#8211; d) show different geometries for the L&#8208;P3PR2 ligands. Their reactivity towards EtO&#8211; results in either a simple addition (for 1) or a complex addition, ring&#8208;opening, rearrangement sequence (for 3). Moreover, [Cp'''Ni(&#951;2&#8208;IDippPP(OEt)PPiPr2)] (4) could be methylated by the reaction with MeOTf, which affords an iso&#8208;tetraphosphine ligand, marking the first example of complete functionalization of a polyphosphorus ligand to a complexed phosphine. Mechanistic studies shed light upon the fundamental principles, which differentiate the influence of the isolobal {CpMo(CO)2}, {Cp'''Ni}, and {Cp'''Co}&#8211; transition metal units. Lastly, 3a&#8211;d were chosen as model substrates for further nucleophilic functionalization. In this regard, 3 reacts with [CN]&#8722; in a [3+1] fragmentation reaction affording the dimerized species [{Cp'''Ni}2(&#956;,&#951;1:1:1:1&#8208;cyclo&#8208;P4(PR2)2)] (6a: R = Ph, 6b: R&#160; = &#160;iPr) together with IDippP&#8208;CN. In contrast, the reaction with [ECO]&#8722; (E = P, As) led to an extension of the pnictogen framework yielding [Cp'''Ni(&#951;1:1&#8208;EP4Ph2IDipp)] (8a: E = P, 8b: E = As).

         <title>Reversible Decarbonylation of a Metal Phosphaketene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a metalated phosphastannene through the base&#8208;induced decarbonylation of a metal phosphaethynolate complex is described. This decarbonylation reaction appears to be reversible, allowing for the transfer of the phosphaethynolate moiety to other metal centers through salt&#8208;metathesis reactions with concomitant release of a stannylene.








Abstract
The synthesis of a metalated phosphastannene by reaction of the known cobalt(I) phosphaketene complex Co(DippPDI)(PCO) (DippPDI = 1,1&#8242;&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl)bis(N&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;imine) with Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2 is described. The resulting compound, Co(DippPDI)(CO){P&#9552;Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2}, contains a localized P&#9552;Sn double bond, yet reacts like a phosphaketene transfer reagent, suggesting that, in solution, Co(DippPDI)(CO){P&#9552;Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2} appears to exist in equilibrium with Co(DippPDI)(PCO) and Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2. This is facilitated by the fact that, on decarbonylation with Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2, the carbon monoxide extruded from the phosphaketene precursor Co(DippPDI)(PCO) remains in the coordination sphere of cobalt. The novel phosphaketene compounds (IDipp)Au(PCO) (IDipp = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) and (DippNacNac)Zn(PCO) (DippNacnac = HC[C(Me)N(Dipp)]2; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) can be synthesized by reaction of Co(DippPDI)(CO){P&#9552;Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2} with Au(IDipp)Cl or (DippNacNac)ZnCl&#183;LiCl(OEt2)2, respectively. In the case of the former, the released stannylene Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2 ultimately inserts into the Au&#9472;PCO bond, affording the tin(IV) complex (IDipp)AuSn(PCO)[CH(SiMe3)2]2.

         <title>Precise Epitaxial 1D and 2D Growth of Polyester&#8208;Based Materials in n&#8208;Alkanes</title>

Living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly is a facile technique for the synthesis of low&#8208;length dispersity 1D and 2D nanoparticles. Oil&#8208;based systems have applications in electronics and as friction modifiers and are underreported in literature. In this work, we synthesize tunable block copolymers with a poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (PCL) core&#8208;forming block and poly(n&#8208;methacrylate) corona block. We report on their self&#8208;assembly in n&#8208;octane for the synthesis of monodisperse nanoparticles of a controlled length and morphology.








Abstract
Crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) has been extensively studied for the formation of bespoke nanoparticles and provides a unique way to control the unidirectional growth of block copolymers (BCPs). Currently, oil&#8208;soluble nanoparticles represent an under&#8208;researched area in the literature, stemming from the difficulty in synthesizing organic nanoparticles with higher&#8208;order morphologies using traditional techniques. These oil&#8208;soluble nanoparticles have uses as components in products as diverse as electronics and engine oils, with current research determining a strong relationship between morphology and performance, with anisotropic nanoparticles outperforming spherical counterparts. Here, we report on the facile self&#8208;assembly of polyester&#8208;based BCPs in n&#8208;octane to achieve low&#8208;dispersity 1D and 2D nanoparticles. This report focuses on using tunable, oil&#8208;soluble polymers and aims to understand their self&#8208;assembly in n&#8208;octane through the variation of self&#8208;assembly conditions and unimer solubility to form nanoparticles of a controlled and variable size.

The dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeted PDI&#8208;based probe, LD&#8208;ER&#8208;PDI, has a 2&#8208;azetidinone substituent in the bay region and two different targeting groups at the opposite ends of the imide positions for LDs and ER, enabling the discrimination between LDs and ER. Moreover, it can effectively visualize the dynamic behaviors of LDs and ER under starvation and oleic acid&#8208;treated conditions, and also allows real&#8208;time monitoring of LDs formation from the ER.








Abstract
In the complex cellular microenvironment, lipid droplets (LDs) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Their interactions are crucial for regulating processes such as lipid metabolism. Nevertheless, simultaneously monitoring these two organelles remains a challenging task. In this study, a dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeted perylene diimides (PDIs) based probe, LD&#8208;ER&#8208;PDI, by incorporating a 2&#8208;azetidinone substituent in the bay&#8208;region and two distinct targeting groups for LDs and ER at opposite ends of the imide positions was developed, enabling discrimination between LDs and ER. Moreover, it can effectively visualize the dynamic behaviors of LDs and ER under starvation and oleic acid&#8208;treated conditions, and also allows real&#8208;time monitoring of LDs formation from the ER. This work not only provides a valuable tool for studying the dynamic interactions between LDs and ER but also highlights a strategy for designing dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeted fluorescent probes.

         <title>Boost of Chiroptical Responses Through the Enhancement of Electron Transition Dipole Moment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral spirobifluorene systems are peripherally &#960;&#8208;extended via Knoevenagel condensation to boost their electric transition dipole moments (ETDM). A direct ETDM&#8211;g&#8208;factor correlation is established through ECD and TD&#8208;DFT analyses. This strategy allows precise control of exciton coupling and chiroptical amplification in rigid &#960;&#8208;conjugated scaffolds, opening new avenues toward high&#8208;performance chiroptical materials.








Abstract
The development of robust chiroptical systems is crucial for advancing optoelectronic technologies. Spirobifluorenes (SBFs) have proven to be versatile scaffolds for the construction of a wide variety of robust axially chiral compounds presenting strong chiroptical responses. Herein, we present a strategy for boosting the chiroptical responses via enhancing electric transition dipole moment (ETDM) of interacting chromophores in C2&#8208;symmetric SBFs presenting exciton coupling. To experimentally validate this approach, we peripherally extended the SBF scaffold through Knoevenagel condensation with the aim of increasing the ETDM of the featured chromophores. The influence of the functionalization on the ETDM was investigated using a combination of computational modeling and experimental techniques, enabling a detailed examination of the relationship between molecular structure and chiroptical properties. Our results demonstrate that peripheral functionalization of SBFs significantly enhances the electric transition dipole moment (ETDM) of the constituent chromophores, with each incremental increase in ETDM resulting in a five&#8208;fold enhancement of the g&#8208;factor, thereby substantially amplifying the overall chiroptical activity. This straightforward strategy underscores the importance of the ETDM of interacting chromophores in fine&#8208;tuning the optoelectronic properties and provides a promising avenue for the rational design of high&#8208;performance chiroptical materials.

         <title>N&#8208;Sulfonyl Imidazoliums as the Versatile Coupling Reagents and Sulfonating Reagents in Synthesis of Amides, Esters, Thioesters, Phosphoramides, Phosphoesters, Glycosides, Sulfonamides, and Sulfonates</title>

         <dc:description>
For the first time, the bench&#8208;stable N&#8208;sulfonyl imidazoliums prepared by us were used as the highly efficient coupling reagents and sulfonating reagents, and they were successfully applied in synthesis of amides, dipeptides, solid phase polypeptide, carboxylic esters, carboxylic thioesters, phosphamides, phosphoesters, glycosides, sulfonamides, and sulfonates in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields.








Abstract
Here, we report a novel strategy for the first time: bench&#8208;stable N&#8208;sulfonyl imidazoliums were used as the robust and versatile coupling reagents and sulfonating reagents. Fast reactions of N&#8208;sulfonyl imidazoliums with carboxylic acids or phosphodiesters formed carboxylic acid&#8208;sulfonic acid mixed anhydrides and phospho&#8208;sulfonic acid mixed anhydrides, respectively, and the subsequent treatments of the highly active intermediates with the corresponding nucleophilic partners in the presence of imidazoles at room temperature provided amides, dipeptides, carboxylic esters, carboxylic thioesters (almost without racemization during the formation of amides, dipeptides, esters, thioesters), phosphamides, and phosphoesters in high to excellent yields. This kind of N&#8208;sulfonyl imidazolium as the coupling reagent was successfully applied in solid phase synthesis of a polypeptide containing 32 amino acid residues. This strategy was effectively extended to the construction of glycosides, and high steroselectivity and good yields were provided. In addition, reactions of N&#8208;sulfonyl imidazoliums with amines or alcohols afforded the corresponding sulfonamides and sulfonates in excellent yields. This study should provide a highly efficient, economical, and practical strategy for construction of diverse molecules.

         <title>Novel Reducibility&#8208;Tunable Carbon Dots for Efficient Radicals Scavenging and Material&#8208;Controlled Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;toxic carbon dots with excellent reducibility (r&#8208;CDs) synthesized by simple pyrolysis method exhibit effective activity for multi&#8208;radicals scavenging and have been successfully applied to fruit preservation. Interestingly, the reducibility of r&#8208;CDs can be easily regulated by N&#8208;doping, which can be used as new reductants to control the synthesis of Au NMs with different morphologies and sizes.








Abstract
The development of efficient, nontoxic, and low&#8208;cost nano&#8208;antioxidants has attracted extensive attention in food preservation but still remains a great challenge in materials design and mechanism exploration. Herein, novel reductive carbon dots (r&#8208;CDs) were successfully synthesized via a simple pyrolysis technique using sucrose as the precursor. The experimental results show that r&#8208;CDs possess excellent reducibility, and can effectively scavenge a variety of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). So, the r&#8208;CDs exhibit remarkable preservation effects on apples and strawberries and significantly extend their shelf&#8208;life. Mechanistic studies reveal that their outstanding reducibility/antioxidant property is attributed to the formed carbon&#8208;core and numerous hydroxyl groups in the pyrolysis process. More interestingly, the reducibility of r&#8208;CDs can be gradually regulated by nitrogen doping, the obtained N&#8208;doped CDs (N&#8208;CDs) can be used to synthesize gold nanomaterial with different morphology and size, proving its potential applications in material&#8208;controlled synthesis. This study provides a new idea for the development of non&#8208;toxic, efficient carbon nano&#8208;antioxidants with tunable reducibility for food preservation and material&#8208;controlled synthesis.

         <title>Advances in Mechanochemical Methods for One&#8208;Pot Multistep Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in mechanochemical methods for multistep organic synthesis, focusing on sequential one&#8208;pot approaches performed by grinding or ball milling. The presented transformations are discussed in terms of efficiency, applicability, and sustainability, assessing both the challenges and potential of solvent&#8208;free one&#8208;pot approaches to contribute to greener strategies in organic synthesis.








Abstract
Mechanochemical synthesis has emerged as a powerful and more sustainable alternative to conventional solution&#8208;based methods, offering advantages such as no or only minimal solvent use, reduced reaction times, and simplified operational conditions. The integration of multiple steps into a single reaction vessel further enhances these benefits by eliminating workup and purification steps, reducing waste, and often improving overall efficiency. This review highlights recent advancements in mechanochemical one&#8208;pot multistep reactions in organic synthesis, focusing on protocols with sequential one&#8208;pot operation. Diverse transformations are covered, including heterocycle formation, functional group interconversions, and the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients, while discussing both the operational and environmental advantages of these methodologies, along with their remaining challenges. Overall, mechanochemical one&#8208;pot synthesis has the potential to streamline transformations and therefore contribute to more sustainable approaches in modern organic synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Artificial Light&#8208;Driven Ion Pumps</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent breakthroughs in artificial light&#8208;driven ion pumps, with a focus on two distinct mechanisms: photoelectric&#8208;driven transport and molecular phototransduction. It explores key design principles, including material selection and nanostructuring strategies, and critically evaluates performance metrics such as pumping rates, directionality, and fatigue resistance.








Abstract
Nature's molecular machinery has long provided inspiration for the development of functional materials, with natural ion pumps exemplifying the efficient conversion of solar energy into directional ion transport. This process is crucial for cellular signaling, bioenergy conversion, and photosynthesis. Motivated by these biological systems, artificial light&#8208;driven ion pumps have emerged as transformative technologies for sustainable energy harvesting, desalination, and bioelectronic innovations. This review categorizes synthetic light&#8208;driven ion pumps into two primary mechanistic paradigms: (1) photoelectric&#8208;driven transport, which leverages photoinduced charge separation in semiconductor structures, and (2) molecular phototransduction, which utilizes light&#8208;induced isomerization or conformational changes in photoactive molecules. For each paradigm, we trace their biomimetic origins to natural ion transport mechanisms, followed by a detailed analysis of design strategies, operational principles, and material innovations. These innovations range from dynamic photoresponsive molecules and semiconductors to semiconductor heterostructures, all of which enable precise control over ion selectivity, flux, and energy conversion in a spatiotemporal manner. Finally, we discuss the emerging applications of light&#8208;driven ion pumps and the remaining challenges for their practical implementation.

         <title>Cyanomethylation of Aldehydes on an Electrochemical Microflow System and Utility of Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Examination of the Reaction Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyanomethylation of carbonyl compounds affords a &#946;&#8208;hydroxy nitrile, which is very useful in the field of synthetic organic chemistry. Although several electrochemical methods have also been reported to achieve cyanomethylation of carbonyl compounds, dehydration as a major side reaction is a significant issue that needs to be prevented. An electrochemical flow reactor, free from side reactions through rapid removal of the reaction solution from the electrode surface, enables the electrochemical cyanomethylation of aldehydes in acetonitrile without any dehydrated side products. To find the &#8220;best&#8221; reaction conditions for each starting material, we used machine learning models. In addition, comparing the machine learning models constructed using various molecular descriptors contributed to understanding the critical molecular properties to proceed the electrochemical cyanomethylation. Our cyanomethylation using a flow system went to completion with a semi&#8208;catalytic amount of electrical input, which is not consistent with the conventional basic mechanism, and DFT calculations suggest a radical mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Ammonium&#8208;Promoted&#8208;Proton Transfer for Photocatalysis of H2O2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as effective photocatalysts for the environmentally friendly synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) under solar sunlight. Besides electron transfer in an ORR process, proton transport also serves as an important role in promoting kinetic rate, which was majorly improved via modifying the chemical structures of COFs, but seldom to be explored through a simple additive composition. In work, we report the preparation of two new vinylene&#8208;linked COFs termed g&#8208;TDM&#8208;COF and g&#8208;TBD&#8208;COF, respectively.&#160; The methoxyl substituents pended on the backbones of these COFs rendered them with hydrogen bond donating capabilities. Combined with their substantial semiconducting properties, the COFs enable photocatalysis of hydroperoxide (H2O2) production. Simply compositing these COFs with ammonium ions markedly improved the photoelectric properties, leading to an over 8&#8208;fold enhancement of photocatalytic H2O2 production relative to the neat COFs, and an increase in apparent quantum yields (AQYs) from 0.70% to 4.22% at 500 nm. Such phenomenon could be attributed to the efficient interaction ammonium ions with the COFs via hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction, thus favorable for broading light&#8208;harvesting, narrowing band gaps, and strengthening proton conductivity, As a consequence, their photocatalytic performance could be distinctly enhanced.</dc:description>

         <title>Cis&#8208;Chelating Diphosphanes for Intracavity Nickel(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Ethylene Oligomerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four cavity&#8208;shaped diphosphanes have been synthesized from both &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrins. The metal&#8208;confining properties of these ligands were exploited in nickel&#8208;catalyzed ethylene oligomerization.

Abstract
Four cis&#8208;chelating diphosphanes derived from cyclodextrins (CDs), each featuring a distinct intracavity environment, compel NiII or PdII metal centers to reside within &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;CD cavities. Nickel(II) complexes of these metal&#8208;confining ligands act as active catalysts in ethylene oligomerization upon activation with modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO). The size of the cavity and the position of the P2Ni fragment relative to the cavity affect both the activity and selectivity of the reaction. In all instances, 1&#8208;butene is the major product (up to 98% C4 products and 90% 1&#8208;butene within the C4 fraction). Extensive theoretical studies with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods carried out on the most selective system suggest that the CD cavity restricts isomerization pathways by limiting the mobility of the coordinated olefin in this constrained supramolecular environment, thereby enhancing &#945;&#8208;olefin formation.

         <title>Conformational switch in the alpha&#8208;synuclein C&#8208;terminus domain directs its fibril polymorphs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Synuclein (&#945;Syn) inclusions are a pathological hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases disorders. While cryo&#8208;electron microscopy studies have revealed distinct fibril polymorphs across different synucleinopathies, the molecular switches controlling polymorphism remain unveiled. In this study, we found that fibril morphology is associated with the conformational state of monomeric &#945;Syn. Through systematic evaluation of the ionic strength and temperature, we generated two distinct polymorphs: a twisted morphology at low ionic strength and temperature, and a rod&#8208;like morphology at higher ionic strength and temperature. Using solid&#8208;state NMR, we revealed that both polymorphs share a highly conserved core structure, with morphological differences arising probably from distinct structural arrangements at the protofilament interfaces. Furthermore, we found that a specific conformational change in the C&#8208;terminal domain of the monomeric &#945;Syn serves as a molecular switch for the formation of polymorphs. Interestingly, this conformational change can also be triggered by calcium binding to the C&#8208;terminus, connecting environmental factors to specific fibril architectures. Our results reveal a conformational role for the C&#8208;terminal domain that influences aSyn fibril morphology, providing significant insights into the fibrogenesis of &#945;Syn.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of Aluminum Nanoparticles: Insights from AlH3&#183;(NMP) x  Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The controlled chemical synthesis of Aluminum nanocrystals (Al NCs) is crucial for their applications in plasmonics, photocatalysis, and optoelectronics. However, there is still a lack of correlation between the precursor of Al hydride N&#8208;methylpyrrolidine (AlH3&#183;(NMP)x) and the Al NC&#160;synthesis outcomes . Here, we report the synthesis of AlH3&#183;(NMP)x&#160;complexes with different coordination numbers (x&#160;from 1.0 to 2.0) and their characterization as precursors regulating the morphology of Al NCs. We isolated AlH3&#183;(NMP)1.0&#160;single crystals from AlH3&#183;(NMP)x&#160;mixtures and successfully elucidated the structure of H3Al&#183;(NMP)1.0&#160;through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Importantly, H3Al&#183;(NMP)1.0&#160;exhibited the fastest decomposition rate, yielding highly monodisperse Al NCs with well&#8208;defined shapes and the narrowest size distribution, while higher coordination numbers led to increased polydispersity and irregular morphologies. Additionally, we observed distinct multipole plasmonic resonances in Al NCs synthesized from lower coordination number precursors, highlighting their superior optical properties. This work establishes a direct correlation between precursor coordination chemistry and Al NC synthesis outcomes, providing a foundation for optimizing nanoparticle production for advanced material applications.</dc:description>

We isolated AlH3&#183;(NMP)1.0&#160;single crystals from AlH3&#183;(NMP)x&#160;mixtures and successfully elucidated the structure of H3Al&#183;(NMP)1.0&#160;through single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Importantly, H3Al&#183;(NMP)1.0&#160;exhibited the fastest decomposition rate, yielding highly monodisperse Al NCs with well-defined shapes and the narrowest size distribution, while higher coordination numbers led to increased polydispersity and irregular morphologies. Additionally, we observed distinct multipole plasmonic resonances in Al NCs synthesized from lower coordination number precursors, highlighting their superior optical properties. This work establishes a direct correlation between precursor coordination chemistry and Al NC synthesis outcomes, providing a foundation for optimizing nanoparticle production for advanced material applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Divergent Responses of Carbon Nitride Dot&#8208;Based Amorphous Species and Small Molecule Hybrids to Trace Level Analytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bottom&#8208;up synthesis of carbon nitride dots (CNDs) offers a versatile platform for the creation of diverse nanomaterials with tunable properties. Here, we report a facile hydrothermal approach using citric acid and urea as precursors to synthesize CNDs with varying degrees of condensation and crystallinity. By carefully controlling reaction conditions and post&#8208;synthetic treatments, we obtained two distinct fractions: a polycrystalline fraction composed of small&#8208;molecule hybrids and an amorphous fraction containing CNDs. We then sought to understand how the dominant species in these fractions impact sensing abilities using trace&#8208;level explosive exemplars. The results have important implications for sensing and related applications where understanding the complex interplay between synthetic conditions and post&#8208;synthetic processing play vital roles in determining the final properties of CND materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Unleashing the Biosensing Potential of 2D Inorganic Nanomaterials: The Journey of a Decade</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the growing need for rapid, sensitive and accurate point&#8208;of&#8208;care biosensors, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have gained significant attention, establishing them as versatile candidates for advanced biomedical applications. Biosensors utilizing 2D nanomaterials enable real&#8208;time disease monitoring, allowing for prompt intervention and therapy, tracking of physiological activities, enhancing the understanding of human biosystem. Since they are cost&#8208;effective and user&#8208;friendly, 2D nanomaterials have been utilized in commercial biosensors. &#160;Over the past decade, graphene and its derivatives have been the most studied 2D nanomaterials, due to their large surface area, tuneable electronic and optical properties, which significantly enhances their sensitivity and specificity. Nevertheless, recently discovered 2D nanomaterials, including MXenes, black phosphorus and hexagonal boron nitride, remain largely unexplored. Despite their numerous applications, the broader potential of these materials in biosensing remains insufficiently explored in current literature. This review offers a comprehensive perspective by specifically focussing on inorganic 2D nanomaterials, an area that remains underrepresented in the literature. It provides an in&#8208;depth overview of their unique physicochemical properties and how these features contribute towards enhancing the performance of biosensors, thereby offering new and valuable insights into their emerging role in advanced biomedical diagnostics.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Tetrahedron&#8208;Enhanced Catalytic Hairpin Assembly for In Situ Monitoring of Viral RNA in Host Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Viruses pose significant threats to global public health and have substantial socio&#8208;economic impacts. Developing rapid, sensitive and specific in situ virus detection technologies is crucial for tracking viral genome release, replication in host cells, and intercellular transmission, thus holding great promise in understanding viral infection mechanisms, enabling early diagnosis, screening antiviral drugs, and formulating prevention and treatment strategies. In this study, we present a multifunctional tetrahedral DNA nanostructure (TDN)&#8208;based system designed to monitor viral RNA levels in host cells in situ. The system employs a TDN&#8208;based hyperbranched catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) reaction to achieve rapid and powerful signal amplification, generating specific fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signals in response to target viral RNA. Using Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) as a model, we developed the THA@JEV system responding to JEV&#8208;RNA. This system demonstrated rapid and sensitive detection of JEV&#8208;RNA within 12 min in a cell&#8208;free environment, enabling real&#8208;time imaging of JEV&#8208;RNA in situ within host cells. The integrated TDN structure enhanced the biological stability of the probes and ensured their reliability under various stress conditions and microenvironments. This TDN&#8208;based sensor system shows significant potential for elucidating viral infection pathways and advancing related virology research, as well as for screening antiviral drugs.</dc:description>

Abstract
The first total synthesis of the 2,3,5&#8208;O&#8208;(S,R)&#8208;NonaHydroxyTriPhenoylated (NHTP) and 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;(S)&#8208;HexaHydroxy&#8208;DiPhenoylated (HHDP) C&#8208;glucosidic ellagitannin (&#8722;)&#8208;vescalagin was accomplished through a bioinspired route involving intramolecular atroposelective cupric&#8208;diamine complex&#8208;mediated phenolic couplings of gallates to forge its HHDP and NHTP units and a methoxyamine&#8208;driven opening of a glucopyranose intermediate followed by a phenolic aldol&#8208;type reaction to form its C&#8208;arylglucosidic bond. The minor epimer that resulted from this bond&#8208;forming event was used to complete also a first total synthesis of the vescalagin epimer, (&#8722;)&#8208;castalagin.

         <title>An Efficient Thiol&#8208;ene Mediated Protocol for Thiolated Peptide Synthesis and On&#8208;Resin Diversification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a sequential acyl&#8208;thiol&#8208;ene/S&#8208;deacetylation protocol for selective installation of thiol residues onto synthetic peptides, on&#8208;resin, is demonstrated. The hydrothiolation/S&#8208;deacetylation protocol offers a novel synthetic tool for direct peptide conjugation on&#8208;resin and for the preparation of novel disulfide containing neuropeptides displaying non&#8208;natural ring sizes without intermediate purification steps.








Abstract
The unique nucleophilic and redox properties of the sulfhydryl group render it highly useful as a synthetic handle for the diversification of peptide structure, including macrocyclization, ligation, and bioconjugation. Herein, a sequential acyl&#8208;thiol&#8208;ene/S&#8208;deacetylation protocol for selectively installing thiol residues onto bioactive peptides on&#8208;resin is demonstrated. Through judicious placement of appropriate unsaturated residues, the hydrothiolation/S&#8208;deacetylation protocol offers a novel synthetic strategy to investigate the structure&#8208;activity relationship of disulfide&#8208;containing peptides displaying different ring sizes. Furthermore, a new and generally applicable fluorescent labeling strategy is introduced to facilitate direct on&#8208;resin conjugation without intermediate purification steps. These new methods provide a robust and versatile platform for peptide macrocyclization and bioconjugation, with broad applications in peptide synthesis and chemical biology.

         <title>Fluorescent Chromophore Construction via Through&#8208;Space Conjugation of Caprolactam and Itaconic Acid: Mechanistic Validation Enabled by 3D&#8208;Printed Architectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonaromatic fluorescent colloids are formed by thermally driven hydrogen bonding between CPL and ITA. Disrupting the hydrogen bonds within the system by 3D printing quenches the fluorescence, which enables applications as fluorescent materials. The colloids can be used as sustainable, low&#8208;cost alternatives to aromatic systems.








Abstract
Fluorescence characteristics are generally attributed to conjugated molecular structures. Substances exhibiting chromatic or fluorescent effects hold significant application value in functional coatings, biochemical detection, anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies, and pharmaceutical tracking due to their distinctive optical identification properties. Although numerous fluorescent materials have been developed, research on fluorescence mechanisms in low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight substances remains insufficient. This study serendipitously discovered that a simple thermal mixing reaction between caprolactam (CPL) and itaconic acid (ITA) can produce a fluorescent&#8208;colored metastable colloidal system. The colloid exhibits exceptional stability at ambient temperature, maintaining noncrystalline status or forming novel butterfly/leaf&#8208;like crystal structures upon cooling, with reversible colloidal characteristics through thermal cycling. Through comprehensive characterization using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT&#8208;IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and polarized optical microscopy, we elucidated the chromatic and fluorescent mechanisms: intermolecular hydrogen bonding networks facilitate the construction of spatial conjugation systems containing unsaturated groups, achieving photoluminescence via &#960;&#8208;electron orbital transitions. The reliability of fluorescence color generation mechanism was confirmed by 3D printing side. This material exhibits excellent solubility in common solvents and shows promising potential for developing fluorescent composites through polymer matrix incorporation.

         <title>Efficient Deep&#8208;Blue TADF Emission from Multiheteroatom&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Embedded with Dual B&#9472;O Covalent Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel TADF emitter with a multiheteroatom PAH skeleton featuring dual B&#9472;O covalent bonds instead of isolated boron atoms was reported. BNB&#8208;OPTZ was synthesized via a one&#8208;pot, demethylation&#8208;directed, lithium&#8208;free method in over 80% yield. The emitter exhibits deep blue emission at 441&#160;nm in toluene, with CIE coordinates of (0.14, 0.05). OLEDs based on BNB&#8208;OPTZ achieved a maximum EQE of 23.1%, demonstrating the potential of B&#9472;O covalent bonds&#8208;embedded PAHs for high&#8208;performance blue OLEDs.








Abstract
Boron&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have demonstrated exceptional potential in the development of high&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this study, we propose a novel strategy for constructing PAH structures with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties by incorporating boron&#8208;oxygen (B&#9472;O) covalent bonds, as opposed to doping isolated boron atoms. The newly designed multiheteroatom&#8208;doped molecule, BNB&#8208;OPTZ, was synthesized via a demethylation&#8208;directed, lithium&#8208;free methodology, achieving an impressive one&#8208;pot yield exceeding 80%. BNB&#8208;OPTZ adopts a symmetric, distorted semi&#8208;planar rigid conformation. Theoretical calculations reveal its long&#8208;range charge transfer characteristics. The molecule exhibits deep blue emission with a peak wavelength of 441&#160;nm in toluene solution, accompanied by CIE coordinates of (0.14, 0.05). Notably, the blue OLED device using BNB&#8208;OPTZ achieved a remarkable external quantum efficiency of 23.1%. These findings suggest that the incorporation of B&#9472;O covalent bonds into multiheteroatom&#8208;doped PAH frameworks offers a promising design strategy for advancing PAH&#8208;based blue&#8208;light OLED applications.

         <title>Investigation of the Degree of Functionalization and Colloidal Stability of Shell&#8208;by&#8208;Shell Functionalized TiO2 Nanoparticles as a Function of Different Phosphonic Acid Chain Lengths</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, a series of&#160;Shell&#8208;by&#8208;Shell&#160;(SbS)&#8208;functionalized colloidal systems consisting of 6 nm TiO2&#160;anatase nanoparticles (NPs), one of the phosphonic acids (PAs) propylphosphonic acid (PAC3), hexylphosphonic acid (PAC6), dodecylphosphonic acid (PAC12), tetradecylphosphonic acid (PAC14), hexadecylphosphonic acid (PAC16), octadecylphosphonic acid (PAC18) and the amphiphile sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) were prepared, resulting in TiO2&#8208;PACX@SDBS (X = 3, 6, 12, 14, 16, or 18) NPs dispersed in deionized water (DIW). During the whole functionalization process, the NPs were subjected to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to gain insights into their degree of functionalization and respective thermal stability. In addition, the colloidal stability of the NPs as a function of PA chain length was analyzed by analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). By combining both TGA and AUC, it was found that the resulting hierarchical NP architectures form agglomerates, with the degree of agglomeration depending on the length of the PA used for the first&#8208;shell functionalization. This allows conclusions to be drawn about the efficiency of the overlap between the PA and the SDBS carbon chain.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Protein Photo&#8208;Stability Analysis Using SRCD in the Presence of Phospholipid SUVs.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interaction between lipids and proteins impacts on a multitude of cellular processes and may contribute to the onset of several pathologies and ageing. Such processes are frequently linked to oxidative stress, whereby polyunsaturated fatty acids act as substrates for in vivo lipoxidation. The subsequent lipid peroxidation and/or isomerisation is known to affect membrane organization, as well as to modify proteins and DNA, leading to functional alterations. Aim of this study was to evaluate the capacity of UV denaturation experiments to induce lipid modification and to investigate the influence of lipid presence on the conformational stability of selected soluble model proteins. To this end, the UV&#8208;denaturation experiment developed at the B23 beamline of the Diamond Light Source (UK) is employed, which high photon flux and brilliance of the incident beamlight induce protein denaturation when repeated consecutive synchrotron radiation circular dichroism spectra are acquired in the far&#8208;UV region, diagnostic of protein folding. This allows the estimation of protein photostability. Our findings show that the presence of lipid vesicles (SUVs) significantly impacts the UV&#8208;denaturation of proteins, preserving the native structure in proteins with a high helical content. This suggests that lipids may play a protective role against light&#8208;induced damage to proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible photocyclization of imidazoleisoindole&#8208;based stilbene derivative apparently over non&#8208;triene form</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diarylethene is one of the most extensively studied photochromic compounds due to its remarkable properties. Recently, nitrogen&#8208;based diarylethenes have been reported to exhibit unusual photochromic behavior. In this study, we synthesized an imidazoleisoindole&#8208;based stilbene analogue, which involves a neutral C=C&#8208;C=C&#8208;C&#8208;N framework along with C=C&#8208;C=C&#8208;C=N form as a minor mesomeric bipolar form. Crystal structural analysis supported major contribution of the former from. Surprisingly, the molecule exhibited not only E&#8211;Z photoisomerization but also the 6&#960;&#8208;photocyclization with photochemical quantum yields over 0.3 for cyclization reaction. These values are comparable to the usual diarylethenes.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Diarylethene is one of the most extensively studied photochromic compounds due to its remarkable properties. Recently, nitrogen-based diarylethenes have been reported to exhibit unusual photochromic behavior. In this study, we synthesized an imidazoleisoindole-based stilbene analogue, which involves a neutral C=C-C=C-C-N framework along with C=C-C=C-C=N form as a minor mesomeric bipolar form. Crystal structural analysis supported major contribution of the former from. Surprisingly, the molecule exhibited not only E&#8211;Z photoisomerization but also the 6&#960;-photocyclization with photochemical quantum yields over 0.3 for cyclization reaction. These values are comparable to the usual diarylethenes.

         <title>Aryl Shift Rearrangement in Scholl&#8208;type Reaction toward Nanographene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative dehydrogenation, known as Scholl reaction, is a powerful method for synthesizing many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Sometimes, unexpected rearrangements can lead to the formation of new structures that are usually difficult to obtain. Here, we discover a novel Scholl&#8208;type reaction involving both 1,4&#8208;aryl&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;aryl shift rearrangements, resulting in the production of armchair nanographene. Additionally, we establish the principle of the rearrangement mechanism through thermodynamic and kinetic studies using density functional theory. Theoretical studies indicate that the rearrangement reaction involves both arenium cation&#8208; and radical cation mechanisms. The selection of arenium cation&#8208; or radical cation mechanisms depends on the sizes and positions of the shifting aryl groups. Large biphenyl or triphenylenyl groups undergo the arenium cation mechanism, while a small monophenyl group favors the radical cation mechanism. Our findings offer new insights into the controllable rearrangements in Scholl reaction and provide new synthetic methods for obtaining a variety of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are typically challenging to design.</dc:description>

         <title>Diameter Controllable Separation of Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes by Simply Changing the Metal in Phenanthroline&#8208;Based Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) possess unique electronic and optical properties which are highly dependent on their structures. Therefore, diameter selective synthesis and separation are meaningful for a wide range of their applications. Although various methods have been developed for CNT separations, challenges still remain in more efficient discrimination for diameters and removal of dispersants. Here, we present novel approach for size&#8208;tunable diameter separation of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) using metal&#8208;coordinating supramolecular polymers (M&#8208;PNB)&#160;consisting of phenanthroline&#8208;based nanobrackets (PNB) and metal ions (M). The helical wrapping of SWNTs with&#160;M&#8208;PNB&#160;is confirmed by TEM analysis. Interestingly, Pd(II) and Co(II) ions with&#160;PNB&#160;show the large difference in diameter preference to the smaller (0.90 &#8211; 0.92 nm) and the larger (0.97 &#8211; 1.10 nm) diameters, respectively. Moreover, the combination of these two metal ions in&#160;M&#8208;PNB&#160;is found to enhance the selectivity to the specific (n,m)&#8208;SWNTs. This method offers not only size&#8208;tunable diameter selectivity, but also significant improvements in extraction efficiency, and the facile and thorough removal of the host molecules as compared to previous techniques.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of phosphine&#8208;free Ru(II)&#8208;CNC pincer complexes with benzimidazolylidene&#8208;based CNC&#8208;ligands have been synthesized and characterized which show excellent catalytic activity towards &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones using primary alcohols. DFT investigations revealed that these seemingly non&#8208;bifunctional complexes can operate via inner&#8208;sphere and outer&#8208;sphere mechanisms for the alcohol dehydrogenation step; however, the outer&#8208;sphere path is favored for the subsequent steps. The outer&#8208;sphere path is found to be supported by &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction between the extended aromatic ring system of the benzimidazolylidene&#8208;based CNC&#8208;ligand and aromatic rings of the substrates in a new, unprecedented case of metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity.</dc:description>

Abstract
Three new dinuclear complexes [CuCl(o&#8208;van&#8208;en)Ln(H2O)3 Cl]Cl&#183;C2H6O (Ln = Sm (1), Eu (2), Gd (3); H2(o&#8208;van&#8208;en) is the Schiff base formed by 2/1 condensation of o&#8208;vanillin and ethylenediamine) were prepared in a single crystal form by the method of horizontal diffusion. The prepared complexes were characterized by chemical analyses and IR spectroscopy. The three complexes are isostructural and the Cu(II) is situated in the smaller cavities while the larger cavities accommodate larger Ln(III) atoms. The pentacoordination of the Cu(II) atoms is completed by a chlorido ligand in the apical position, while the octacoordination of the Ln(III) atoms is achieved by three additional aqua and one chlorido coligands. AC susceptibility studies have shown that complexes 2 and 3 exhibit field supported slow magnetic relaxation while complex 1 does not display AC activity.

         <title>Arylboronic Acid Catalyzed Reductive Alkylation of Azoarenes to N&#8208;Alkylated Hydrazines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arylboronic acid&#8208;catalyzed reductive alkylation of azoarene to N&#8208;alkylated hydrazine is reported. The mild reaction conditions suppress N&#8211;N cleaved products and selectively provide trisubstituted hydrazine derivatives. The study suggests the mode of boronic catalysis involves both Br&#248;nsted acid and H&#8208;bond donor catalysis.








Abstract
Hydrazine derivatives are generally difficult to prepare despite their appealing structural simplicity. The synthetic challenge may arise from either the similar reactivity or the relatively low activity of the two nitrogen atoms in a hydrazine precursor. The former would lead to severe selectivity issues while the latter would require harsh reaction conditions. Herein we report a facile method for the synthesis of N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N, N&#8242;&#8208;diarylhydrazines by boronic acid&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot tandem reduction of azoarene to hydrazoarene followed by reductive alkylation with the aldehyde. The mild reaction conditions suppress N&#8211;N cleaved products and selectively provide trisubstituted hydrazine derivatives. The reaction is highly chemoselective and tolerates various hydrogenation&#8208;sensitive functional groups. The method has been successfully utilized in the late&#8208;stage functionalization and diversification of pharmaceuticals. A series of control experiments with boronic acids, boronic ester, and Br&#248;nsted acids were interpreted. The study suggests the mode of boronic catalysis involves both Br&#248;nsted acid and H&#8208;bond donor catalysis. Based on the thermodynamic activation parameters, kinetic Hammett studies, and competitive reaction on the substrate, it has been postulated that the iminium formation step is likely to be the rate&#8208;limiting step.

         <title>Glycans and Chirality: Stereoselectivity at the Core of DC&#8208;SIGN's Recognition. A Novel View of the Optimum Minimal Ligand Epitope</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stereochemical diversity of the &#8220;glycan code&#8221; enables similar chiral motifs to arise from both D&#8208; and L&#8208;sugars. Focused on DC&#8208;SIGN&#8211;glycan recognition, two diverse monosaccharide scaffolds, D&#8208;Man (D&#8208;Rha) and L&#8208;Gal (L&#8208;Fuc), maintain the exquisite stereochemistry encoded in the minimal binding epitope. Decoration of this framework could guide developments of glycomimetics basased DC&#8208;SIGN binders.








Abstract
Glycans exhibit an unparalleled density of stereochemical information, encoded at the monosaccharide level through multiple stereogenic centers, anomeric configurations, ring tautomerism, and conformational variability. Indeed, chiral recognition is fundamental to the interaction between glycans and proteins. Despite the theoretical risk posed by mirror&#8208;image molecules, the stereochemical diversity of the &#8220;glycan code&#8221; enables similar chiral motifs to arise from both D&#8208; and L&#8208;sugars. Herein, we present an in&#8208;depth investigation of the stereochemical features governing lectin&#8211;glycan recognition, using the well&#8208;characterized human C&#8208;type lectin Dendritic cell&#8208;specific ICAM&#8208;3&#8208;grabbing nonintegrin (DC&#8208;SIGN) as a model. By combining experimental (STD&#8208;NMR) and computational approaches, we identified a minimal optimal binding epitope recognized by DC&#8208;SIGN. Key binding requirements include the correct chirality of the Ca2&#8314;&#8208;coordinating oxygens, an adjacent equatorial hydroxyl group for hydrogen bonding with Glu354, and hydrophobic contacts with Val351. Known ligands L&#8208;fucose and D&#8208;mannose fulfill these criteria. Our results further demonstrate that DC&#8208;SIGN also binds &#945;/&#946;&#8208;L&#8208;galactose, &#945;/&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;rhamnose, and myo&#8208;inositol. Among these, &#945;/&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;rhamnose exhibits higher affinity than &#945;&#8208;OMe&#8208;D&#8208;mannose, while &#945;/&#946;&#8208;L&#8208;galactose binds more strongly than D&#8208;rhamnose and myo&#8208;inositol, although with lower affinity than &#945;&#8208;OMe&#8208;L&#8208;fucose. STD&#8208;NMR experiments confirmed that all these ligands share the same core binding epitope.

         <title>Efficient Singlet Oxygen Monitoring in Aqueous Media Comprising a Polymer&#8208;embedded Eu3+&#8208;Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A singlet dioxygen (1O2) sensitive Eu(III) complex embedded in polymer nanoparticles efficiently detects 1O2 in aqueous media by a remarkable increase in Eu3+ luminescence. These particles also adhere to bacteria surfaces, where the cells appear brightly stained in the presence of 1O2 enabling spectroscopic evaluation and easy detection under the microscope.








Abstract
Singlet dioxygen (1O2) plays a pivotal role as the active agent in photodynamic therapy (PDT) for cancer treatment, as well as in the photo&#8208;inactivation of antibiotic&#8208;resistant microbes (antimicrobial photodynamic therapy, aPDT). The ability to sensitively monitor the production and behavior of &#185;O&#8322; following its photo&#8208;catalytic generation is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies. Optical sensor molecules that respond to &#185;O&#8322; through changes in absorption or, more sensitively, fluorescence, are suitable choices. While most monitors report 1O2 via altered absorption spectra, only few compounds respond by the onset of fluorescence, even fewer based on lanthanide luminescence. By embedding a novel lanthanide complex (Eu3+) into polystyrene nanoparticles (beads), we achieved close to a 500&#8208;fold emission intensity boost in the presence of 1O2, very long decay times of up to 879 &#181;s and unprecedented stability in acidic and basic media. Furthermore, the beads present a high&#8208;surface charge (&gt;+30&#160;mV), yielding stable aqueous dispersions, which we exploited in a preliminary &#8220;proof of principle&#8221; staining experiment of (negatively charged) bacterial surfaces. The straightforward synthesis circumvents intricate preparative steps and restrictive costs. The decay characteristics furthermore pave the road to time&#8208;gated measurements, that is, to the suppression of interfering autofluorescence from biological samples.

         <title>Quercetin&#8226;Zirconium Metal Complexes: Insights from Femto to Millisecond Photobehavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The switching off of excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT), followed by the switching on of ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) processes in quercetin (QRT)&#8226;Zr complexes, is crucial for generating Zr&#8208;bound QRT radicals that exhibit significantly shorter lifetimes compared to free QRT radicals. The results indicate a faster regeneration of QRT&#8226;Zr complexes through back electron transfer (BET), which could modulate their antioxidant activities.








Abstract
Metal complexation modulates the antioxidant properties of many flavonoids, including quercetin (QRT). However, competition between the antioxidant and autoxidation processes limits their longevity. This necessitates a deeper understanding of the fate of QRT phenoxy radicals following antioxidant activity. Here, we report on the formation of QRT&#8226;Zr complexes and their photobehaviors, which account for the photochemical reactivity of the generated radicals. In methanol, N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide, and water, the UV&#8208;visible absorption spectra of the 1:1 and 1:2 complexes exhibit a significant bathochromic shift (50&#8211;100&#160;nm) and high global binding constants (1 &#8211; 14&#160;&#215; 109 M&#8722;2). While the formation of charge&#8208;transfer states through ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer in the ground state prevents the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer that typically occurs in QRT, it leads to the generation of excited metal&#8208;bound ligand radicals. We present details on the dynamics and further relaxation from femto to millisecond regimes of the excited complexes and generated species. The lifetimes of the formed radicals are considerably shorter than those of the free QRT radicals due to rapid back electron transfer, regenerating the neutral complexes. These findings will facilitate the design of other systems for antioxidant activity, photocatalysis, and various applications in chemistry, biochemistry, and biomedicine.

         <title>Linkage Engineering of Triazine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Selective Photocatalytic Oxidation of Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

TFPT&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF, with a C&#9552;C linkage, demonstrates significantly higher activities than TFPT&#8208;IM&#8208;COF, with a C&#9552;N linkage, for selective photocatalytic oxidation of amines to imines with O2, highlighting the pivotal role of linkage engineering.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have garnered significant attention as versatile photocatalysts due to their tunable structure and activity. In this work, linkage engineering is applied to two triazine&#8208;based COFs, yielding TFPT&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF, with a C&#9552;C linkage and TFPT&#8208;IM&#8208;COF, with a C&#9552;N linkage. TFPT&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF exhibits better thermal stability and a significantly higher specific surface area than TFPT&#8208;IM&#8208;COF. More importantly, the C&#9552;C linkage in TFPT&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF leads to better optoelectronic properties than the C&#9552;N linkage in TFPT&#8208;IM&#8208;COF, as it promotes efficient charge separation and transfer and &#960;&#8208;delocalization, as evidenced by experiments and density functional theory calculations. Consequently, TFPT&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF demonstrates higher activities than TFPT&#8208;IM&#8208;COF for selective photocatalytic oxidation of amines. Notably, a diverse range of amines achieve high conversions to corresponding imines with high selectivities. Superoxide, generated through photoexcited electron transfer to O2, is identified as the predominant reactive oxygen species. This work underscores the pivotal role of linkage engineering in optimizing COFs for selective reactions.

         <title>B/N&#8208;Codoped Porous Carbons as Metal&#8208;Free and Binder&#8208;Free Electrode Material for Supercapacitors</title>

         <dc:description>
Binder&#8208;free B/N&#8208;codoped porous carbon, derived from a PFD polymer, generates high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state supercapacitors, demonstrating remarkable energy storage capabilities and lights up a 3&#160;V bulb.








Abstract
A facile, cost&#8208;effective, and eco&#8208;friendly approach for the synthesis of B/N&#8208;codoped porous carbon materials has been developed for metal&#8208;free and binder&#8208;free supercapacitors. A set of samples, CPFD&#8208;B/N&#8208;5, CPFD&#8208;B/N&#8208;10, and CPFD&#8208;B/N&#8208;15 have been synthesized by carbonization of a phloroglucinol&#8208;formaldehyde&#8208;dopamine (PFD) polymer and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). Boric acid has been used to introduce different amounts of boron and an undoped sample, CPFD&#8208;N, has been synthesized for comparison. The CPFD materials function as binder&#8208;free electrodes and display excellent electrochemical behavior. The optimization of boron as a heteroatom with a rational distribution of pores enables CPFD&#8208;B/N&#8208;10 electrode to achieve a high capacitance of 962 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g in 1&#160;M H2SO4 electrolyte. It demonstrates excellent rate capability and exceptional cycling stability, retaining over 120% of its capacitance after 5000 cycles at a current density of 30 A/g. It has a specific energy density of 108.22&#160;Wh/kg and a power output of 450.00&#160;W/kg at 1 A/g, effectively bridging the gap between supercapacitors and batteries. A solid&#8208;state symmetric supercapacitor made from the material achieves a capacitance of 622 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g, Coulombic efficiency of 89% after 1,500 cycles and powers a 3&#160;V LED bulb.

         <title>Intramolecular PCET of &#945;&#8208;Keto Acids: Synthesis of Trifluoromethyl Ketones via Ketyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to favourable pharmacological properties, the introduction of the fluorine atom into small molecules has become increasingly more common over the past few decades. In particular, the trifluoromethyl ketone group is of great interest due to its role as a carboxylic acid bioisostere. Recently, these fragments have been accessed via acyl radical equivalents. Herein, we disclose an unconventional intramolecular proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer activation of &#945;&#8208;keto acids by photoredox catalysis to generate ketyl radicals toward accessing functionalizable lactones. These lactones serve as synthons for modular one&#8208;pot syntheses of trifluoromethyl ketones in a net dicarbofunctionalization of electron&#8208;rich olefins.</dc:description>

         <title>Titanium cis&#8208;DACH Salan Catalyst for the Efficient Epoxidation of Non&#8208;Activated Olefins with Hydrogen Peroxide &#8208; Terminal&#8208;Selective Epoxidation of Multiply &#160;Unsaturated Terpenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a new generation of highly active and readily available homogeneous titanium catalysts for the epoxidation of non&#8208;activated olefins with aqueous hydrogen peroxide. Key feature is the introduction of pentafluorophenyl substituents into a salan ligand derived from cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (cis&#8208;DACH). Our novel salan ligand is accessible in one single step by reductive alkylation of cis&#8208;DACH with 3&#8208;(pentafluorophenyl)salicylic aldehyde. In situ com&#173;plexation with Ti(OiPr)4 of the cis&#8208;DACH salan provides the titanium catalyst which, in the presence of aqueous hydrogen peroxide, smoothly epoxidizes a broad spectrum of olefins with up to 95% yield, at a catalyst loading of 0.5 mol&#8208;% only. The achiral cis&#8208;DACH salan catalyst showed syn&#8208;selectivity (4.7:1) in the epoxidation of a chiral, racemic terminal allylic alcohol. This catalyst furthermore allows the regioselective (up to 49:1) epoxidation of the terminal double bond in multiply unsaturated terpenes such as myrcene, (S)&#8208;citronellene, and (R)&#8208;linalool. For the latter two substrates, syn/anti&#8208;selectivity of up to 9:1 was observed. Augmented syn/anti&#8208;selectivity (up to 50:1 syn, or 25:1 anti) can be induced in the epoxidation of the chiral substrates (S)&#8208;citronellene and (R)&#8208;linalool when the "matched" enantiomer of the chiral "Berkessel salalen ligand" is employed.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Benzene Fluorophore with Enhanced Emission: Insights into Photophysical properties through Proton Transfer Mapping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A comprehensive study of a single&#8208;benzene fluorophore, characterized by a low molecular weight and a significant Stokes&#8217; shift, is reported. The fluorophore exhibits Crystallization&#8208;Induced Emission Enhancement and pH&#8208;dependent luminescence, attributable to a conformational lock in the crystalline state and suppression of non&#8208;emissive forms upon deprotonation. Extensive photophysical analysis reveals a quantum yield increase from 1% in solution to 22% in the solid state, along with a consistent emission wavelength irrespective of the state. Theoretical calculations show that the Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT) mechanism is facilitated by the unique orientation of acetyl substituents and a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond in the solid state, and rationalized the large Stokes&#8217; shift observed. We explore the role of crystallization and intramolecular interactions in modifying the photophysical behavior of the fluorophore, emphasizing the absence of solvatochromism and the distinctive absence of strong intermolecular interactions in the solid state. Further theoretical modeling underscores the interplay between geometric conformation and proton transfer in determining emission properties, which is dramatically altered upon deprotonation. Therefore, detailed theoretical approaches to comprehensively map the complete photophysical landscape offer critical insights for the design and synthesis of small molecules that outperform larger fluorophores while retaining stimuli&#8208;responsive properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Vibration and Liquefaction of Flexible and Naturally Bent Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single crystals obtained by cocrystallization of 4,4'&#8208;azopyridine with long&#8208;chain fatty acids, viz. lauric acid, myristic acid, and palmitic acid, exhibit a variety of light&#8208;responsive properties. The molecular arrangement of the cocrystal components in the crystal structure, coupled with the flexibility of the long alkyl chains and the presence of the azo group, enables the elastic and plastically deformable crystals to demonstrate light responsiveness, which manifests as bending, vibration, and liquefaction. The photoresponses arise from two primary mechanisms: the photoisomerisation of azopyridine groups within the crystal lattice and the photothermal effect that generates localized heat under UV light. Consequently, the single crystals display reversible bending and vibrational motion in response to on/off light cycles, as well as temporary liquefaction of the crystalline materials when exposed to higher&#8208;intensity UV light. The arrangement of the long alkyl chains and the presence of weak interactions within the crystal structure imparts deformability to the single crystals while lowering melting points. This work illustrates how adaptive crystalline materials can be developed by modulating the crystal structure of light&#8208;sensitive molecular components through covalent synthesis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The merger of palladium&#8208;catalyzed Tsuji&#8208;Trost reactions with photochemical radical chemistry represents a cutting&#8208;edge field in transition metal catalysis. We report a photochemical palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Heck/reductive allylic homocoupling reaction of 1,3&#8208;dienes. The transformation has a wide substrate scope and good functional group tolerance, providing a platform to synthesize optically pure chiral 1,5&#8208;dienes bearing 1,8&#8208;stereocenters.

         <title>Solvent Effect on the Chiral Arrangement for Two Achiral Metal&#8208;Organic Colloids in the Vortex Field: Rheological Study and Retention Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The vortex features a helical structure and exhibits macroscopic chirality. Over the past few decades, scientists have observed that several achiral compounds display chiroptical activity within the vortex field. The researchers believe that chiral arrangement may have occurred in this process. Herein, we investigate two achiral metal&#8208;organic colloids (Zn3L/DMSO and Zn3L/DMF) which have similar chemical components but exhibit distinct vortex&#8208;responsive chiroptical properties. In the vortex field, the Zn3L/DMSO colloid presents chiroptical activity, whereas the Zn3L/DMF colloid remains chiroptical silent. Rheological studies reveal the possible underlying reasons. The strong solvent&#8208;colloidal particles interactions in the Zn3L/DMSO colloid endow the system with excellent viscoelasticity and reversible thixotropy. These characteristics enable the Zn3L/DMSO colloid to form a reversible chiral arrangement within the vortex. In contrast, the Zn3L/DMF colloid fails to respond to the vortex. Furthermore, the addition of the charged molecule D enhanced the rheological properties of the Zn3L/DMSO colloid, with the potential to preserve its chiroptical activity. Overall, this research is expected to provide new insights into the vortex&#8208;induced chirality of supramolecular colloids, contributing to a deeper understanding of the underlying principles of chiroptical property in such systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Emission in Cu(I)/Mn(II)&#160;Codoped Two&#8208;dimensional Hybrid Cd Chloride Perovskites for White Light Emitting Diodes and Anti&#8208;counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;dimensional halide perovskites have recently attracted considerable attention as promising candidates for single&#8208;component white light emitting diodes (WLEDs). However, it remains challenging to achieve highly efficient white light emission in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) systems. Herein, white light emitting Cu+/Mn2+ codoped 2D (PPDA)CdCl4 perovskites are synthesized via a facile fabrication method. The host is weakly emissive. However, Cu+ and Mn2+ doping can lead to strong green and orange&#8208;red emission, respectively. Spectroscopic characterizations show that there are two independent emission centers, the Cu+&#8208;induced extrinsic self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) which leads to the green emission, and the isolated Mn2+ ion which results in orange&#8208;red emission via the inherent 4T1(G)&#8594;6A1(S) transition. Interestingly, by optimizing the ratio of Cu+ and Mn2+, the codoped sample can exhibit tunable white light emission with variable correlated color temperatures and high photoluminescence quantum yields of 45.2%&#8208;51.1%. In addition, the codoped samples can also exhibit interesting excitation&#8208;dependent emission properties. This work opens up new opportunities for the development of high&#8208;performance 2D perovskite luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Ion Size and &#960;&#8208;Interaction in Stabilizing Calix[4]arene Crown Ether Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work investigates MAXCalix's ability to coordinate alkali and alkaline earth metal ions, showing a preference for larger ions like Cs&#8314;. Structural analysis confirms that &#960;&#8208;interactions with benzene rings enhance stability, particularly for large cations that engage both rings. Competitive NMR experiments validate that stability increases with ionic radius, demonstrating MAXCalix's strong affinity for cesium.








Abstract
This study systematically investigates the influence of ion size on the structure and stability of complexes formed between the calix[4]arene crown ether 1,3&#8208;alt&#8208;25,27&#8208;bis(3,7&#8208; dimethyloctyl&#8208;1&#8208;oxy)calix[4]arenebenzocrown&#8208;6 (MAXCalix) and mono&#8208; and divalent ions from the alkali and alkaline earth metal series. NMR spectroscopy studies revealed that while MAXCalix efficiently coordinates large ions such as Cs+, it also forms complexes with smaller ions like Na+, highlighting the ligand's versatility. The size of the ion directly influences the complex structure, with two distinct structural subtypes identified via NMR and DFT calculations. In addition, &#960;&#8208;interactions between the cation and the cation&#8208;facing benzene rings of the calix[4]arene backbone play an important role in stabilizing the complex. Larger ions like Cs+ benefit from &#960;&#8208;interactions with both cation&#8208;facing rings, whereas smaller ions like K+ interact with only one ring, if any. These &#960;&#8208;interactions are primarily drivers of the enhanced affinity for Cs+ and the resulting higher complex stability. Competitive NMR studies further confirmed that the complex stability increases with increasing ionic radius, and ions of similar size show comparable stability of their complexes.

         <title>Recent Cutting&#8208;Edge Technologies for the Delivery of Peptide Nucleic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides an overview of PNA cellular delivery methods, starting with traditional peptide&#8208;based systems and progressing to advanced approaches using nanoparticles, liposomes, and calixarene. It highlights how these innovative strategies have opened the way for more effective and efficient PNA delivery, ultimately enhancing the potential for broader therapeutic applications of PNAs.








Abstract
Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) have garnered significant attention due to their enhanced chemical, physical, and binding properties in comparison to natural nucleic acids. This prompted their application in antigene/antisense approach, assigning them a pivotal role in gene editing and, more recently, showing their potential as &#8220;bilingual&#8221; molecules being able &#8220;to speak&#8221; both nucleic acid and protein language. However, to expand the applications of PNAs in therapy, the challenge of effectively delivering PNAs to cells needs to be addressed. Among several delivery approaches employed so far, the nanotechnology&#8208;based ones showed great potential. In this review, we provide an overview of the latest in the field (2019 to present), beginning from peptide&#8208;based delivery systems, as well as cutting&#8208;edge approaches involving nanoparticles, liposomes, and calixarene, showing how they have inspired the development of smarter delivery approaches to boost PNAs applications.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A trinuclear cobalt(II) complex incorporating the redox&#8208;active hexahydroxytriphenylene (H6HHTP) ligand was prepared and isolated in two different redox states: [CoII3(sq&#8208;sq&#8208;sq)]3+ (1) and [CoII3(cat&#8208;sq&#8208;sq)]2+ (2) (sq = semiquinone; cat = catecholate), enabled by its remarkable solvatochromic behavior. The ligand field tuning of the Co(II) centers through the ancillary ligand Me3TPA (tris(6&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine) allowed accessing six reversible one&#8208;electron processes instead of only three with the parent TPA ligand, therefore increasing the range of redox&#8208;coupled magnetic and optical switching in this system. Upon reduction, the three redox processes are ligand&#8208;centered and involve the three sq&#8226;&#8208;/cat2&#8208; couples of HHTP, while we hypothesize that some of the oxidation processes may involve the Co(II) metallic species.</dc:description>

         <title>Spectroscopic Interrogation of Thiolate Hydrogen Bonding in the CO Sensor Protein CooA: Implications for Thiolate Ligation Stability and Cytochrome P450 Function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cysteine (Cys) thiolate coordination is a unique ligation motif found in heme enzymes and small molecule sensors. Divergence between these two functional classes of heme thiolate proteins is a result of distinct hydrogen bonding interactions with the axial Cys(thiolate) ligand. We report a spectroscopic analysis of thiolate H&#8208;bonding in CooA, a carbon monoxide&#8208;sensing heme protein from Rhodospirillum rubrum that is known to switch between Cys75(thiolate) and histidine coordination upon reduction. We generated CooA variants with alterations at two residues, Asn42 and His77, which are postulated to influence H&#8208;bonding to Cys75 on the basis of an Fe(II) CooA structure. Using a combination of electronic absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopies, we identified several CooA variants that exhibit changes in thiolate donor strength and propose an H&#8208;bonding model in which Asn42 orients His77 for optimal H&#8208;bonding with Cys75 in Fe(III) CooA. Further, we spectroscopically characterize pyrrolidine&#8208;bound CYP119 to mimic the first coordination sphere of Fe(III) CooA. We show that CooA contains a stronger thiolate&#8208;Fe bond than the pyrrolidine&#8208;bound CYP119, suggesting that Cys(thiolate) H&#8208;bonding interactions in CooA are significantly weaker. These results suggest thiolate H&#8208;bonding is a significant differentiator between the two classes of heme thiolate proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Triphosphaallyl Cation stabilized by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reduction of the triphosphaallyl species 6[GaCl4] with GaI[Ga2Cl7] affords the imidazoliumyl&#8208;substituted (L) bicyclo[2.1.1]&#8208;triphosphane, 10[Ga2Cl7], featuring an unprecedented Ga2Cl5&#8208;bridged P3 scaffold. Reactions of 10[Ga2Cl7] with nucleophiles (Cl&#8208; or NHC) result in rare, selective P&#8211;C bond cleavages, affording Ga2Cly&#8208;substituted triphosphiranes (LP3Ga2Cly, y = 5, 6) via an intramolecular ring closure mechanism. Protonation of 6[GaCl4] gives rise to a similar ring closure, but without P&#8211;C bond cleavage, to afford the L2P3H+ salt 8[OTfGaCl3]2. Additionally, the palladium complex 26[GaCl4], formed through the reaction of 10[Ga2Cl7] with [Pd(PPh3)4], presents a novel bicyclic P3Pd moiety (LP3Pd(PPh3)2[GaCl4]). Comprehensive DFT calculations have been conducted to elucidate the bonding situation in 26[GaCl4], uncovering significant metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand &#960;&#8208;back&#8208;donation and a distinctive 3&#8208;center&#8208;4&#8208;electron hyperbonding phenomenon in the P3Pd framework. These findings offer valuable insights into chemistry of cyclic polyphosphorus compounds and, in particular, the reactivity, structural flexibility, and the coordination properties of cationic triphosphorus species.</dc:description>

         <title>Dinuclear Copper Complex with a Pyridazine&#8208;Bridged Octadentate Ligand: Monooxygenase Activity and Characterization of Copper&#8208;Oxygen Intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper&#8208;containing enzymes catalyze the mono&#8208;oxygenation of aromatic and aliphatic substrates in Nature. Herein, we report on the synthesis of a new dinuclear copper complex supported by an octadentate ligand with a pyridazine backbone. Low&#8208;temperature oxygenation leads to a &#181;&#8208;1,1&#8208;hydroperoxo dicopper(II) (Cu2OOH) complex which in turn stoichiometrically converts anthrone (AT) to anthraquinone (AQ). Oxygenation at room temperature, by contrast, leads to a new species that mediates the conversion of AT to AQ in a catalytic fashion, but neither corresponds to a &#181;&#8208;peroxo nor a mono &#181;&#8208;oxo dicopper complex. For further analysis a &#181;&#8208;hydroxo dicopper(II) (Cu2OH) complex is synthesized by oxidation of the copper(I) complex with AgOTf. The electronic and geometric structures of the Cu2OOH and Cu2OH intermediates as well as the structure of the room&#8208;temperature oxygenation product are elucidated by UV/Vis, Raman, XAS and mass spectrometry, coupled to DFT.</dc:description>

         <title>Two Key Ferredoxins for Nitrogen Fixation Have Different Specificities and Biophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ferredoxins deliver electrons to drive many challenging biochemical transformations, including enzyme&#8208;catalysed nitrogen fixation. We recently showed two distinct ferredoxins, FdC and FdN, were essential for iron nitrogenase mediated nitrogen fixation in Rhodobacter capsulatus. In this study, we perform investigations on FdC and FdN to establish their key differences in terms of specificity, structure and electronic properties. In vivo complementation studies of both the genes encoding FdC (fdxC) and FdN (fdxN), into &#8710;fdxC and &#8710;fdxN R. capsulatus&#8208;deletion strains under N2&#8208;fixing conditions, showed that plasmid&#8208;based expression of fdxN recovered diazotrophic growth and Fe&#8208;nitrogenase activity in both &#8710;fdxC and &#8710;fdxN strains, whilst plasmid&#8208;based fdxC expression could only complement the &#8710;fdxC strain. Spectroscopic analysis of FdC and FdN using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed large differences in the electronic features of FdC and FdN. These differences were accompanied by large structural differences between FdC and FdN, assessed by a crystallographic structure of FdC and an AlphaFold model of FdN. We report novel features in the FdC structure, in terms of secondary structure and hydrogen&#8208;bonding network, compared with structures of other [Fe2S2]&#8208;cluster ferredoxins. Overall, we explore the biophysical properties that influence ferredoxin specificity, whilst providing new insights into the properties of ferredoxins essential for N2&#8208;fixation.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrated Ammonia Capture and Exchange on Ion&#8208;Exchanged 4A Zeolites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ammonia produced in fusion reactors can lead to issues with tritium accountability and corrosion, which increases challenges associated with utilizing it as a source for energy. However, utilizing platinum&#8208;impregnated zeolites can allow for ammonia to be captured in situ and processed for isotope recovery.








Abstract
Ammonia poses a challenge in effluent gas streams due to its corrosive nature. However, in fusion settings tritiated ammonia can be formed, leading to both tritium loss in inventory and the generation of reactive species. Therefore, identifying pathways in which both tritium can be recovered, and the ammonia can be easily handled would be beneficial. One such way to do so would be to combine two useful techniques: ammonia sequestration and hydrogen exchange (ND3&#8594;NH3). However, materials that can both adsorb ammonia and subsequently perform reactions on ammonia have not been well explored. In this work, we present the development of ion&#8208;exchanged A&#8208;type zeolites to be utilized as a support material for platinum catalysts. In this way, the zeolite can adsorb ammonia and the platinum catalyst can facilitate hydrogen exchange allowing for bifunctional reactivity of the material to be achieved. A variety of elements were explored for their effect on A&#8208;type zeolites and resulted in an isotopic difference in the adsorption of ND3 and NH3, noting the use of deuterium as a surrogate for tritium. Several platinum&#8208;impregnated zeolites were able to remove ND3 from the gas stream, indicating that utilizing these materials in isotope recovery processes would improve accountability of these valuable hydrogen isotopes.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ammonia poses a challenge in effluent gas streams due to its corrosive nature. However, in fusion settings tritiated ammonia can be formed, leading to both tritium loss in inventory and the generation of reactive species. Therefore, identifying pathways in which both tritium can be recovered, and the ammonia can be easily handled would be beneficial. One such way to do so would be to combine two useful techniques: ammonia sequestration and hydrogen exchange (ND&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). However, materials that can both adsorb ammonia and subsequently perform reactions on ammonia have not been well explored. In this work, we present the development of ion-exchanged A-type zeolites to be utilized as a support material for platinum catalysts. In this way, the zeolite can adsorb ammonia and the platinum catalyst can facilitate hydrogen exchange allowing for bifunctional reactivity of the material to be achieved. A variety of elements were explored for their effect on A-type zeolites and resulted in an isotopic difference in the adsorption of ND&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, noting the use of deuterium as a surrogate for tritium. Several platinum-impregnated zeolites were able to remove ND&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; from the gas stream, indicating that utilizing these materials in isotope recovery processes would improve accountability of these valuable hydrogen isotopes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering of the Thiamine Diphosphate&#8208;Dependent JanthE for the Synthesis of Tertiary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of (bio)catalytic methods to chiral tertiary alcohols is in demand, yet the enantioselective synthesis of tertiary alcohols with sterically hindered moieties is problematic. JanthE is a novel thiamine diphosphate&#8208;dependent enzyme that catalyzes aldehyde&#8208;ketone cross&#8208;coupling reactions with a wide range of donor and acceptor substrates. However, product formation is low and precludes large&#8208;scale production. We investigated the conversion of 2&#8208;oxobutanoate and the bulky ketone phenoxy&#8208;2&#8208;propanone to the product 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;phenoxypentan&#8208;3&#8208;one as a model reaction for the synthetic capabilities of JanthE. As the reaction design did not significantly improve the yield, we proceeded to rational protein engineering. Docking experiments identified V121, Y268, P293, Y297, and K567 in the active site as important residues for catalysis. Remarkably, the single&#8208;point variant JanthE K567S led to a fivefold increase in product formation (&gt;90% ee) compared to the wild type enzyme (93% ee). The reaction was performed at preparative scale proving the direct possibility of application. Additionally, when the reaction was extended to longer 2&#8208;oxopentanoate, the double variant K567S_Y297P showed a 5&#8208;fold increase in product formation compared to the wild type. Our results demonstrate the evolvability and versatility of JanthE for the enantioselective synthesis of sterically hindered tertiary alcohols.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Potent Mannose&#8208;6&#8208;Phosphate Derivatives as Ligands for CI&#8208;M6P/IGF2R Using Fluorescence Polarization Assay</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed and synthesized novel mannose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate (M6P) derivatives to enhance their binding affinity for the CI&#8208;M6P/IGF2 receptor, which plays a key role in lysosomal targeting. Using a fluorescence polarization assay, we evaluated di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and penta&#8208;M6P peptides and modified M6P analogs. Our results show that multivalent ligands significantly improve receptor binding, with phosphonate groups emerging as a promising stable alternative to native M6P








Abstract
The cation&#8208;independent mannose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate/IGF2 receptor (CI&#8208;M6P/IGF2R) plays a crucial role in transporting lysosomal enzymes and other ligands. In this study, we designed and synthesized novel stable mannose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate (M6P) derivatives to enhance their affinity for CI&#8208;M6P/IGF2R. To evaluate the binding potency, we employed a sensitive and cost&#8208;effective fluorescence polarization assay, enabling rapid quantification of receptor&#8211;ligand interactions in solution. The tested compounds included di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and penta&#8208;M6P peptides along with various M6P&#8208;derived small molecules featuring phosphate isosteres or other functional modifications. Our findings indicate that ligands bearing multiple M6P moieties exhibit significantly higher receptor affinities than monomeric compounds and that phosphonate groups may serve as a more stable and potent alternative to native M6P. Computational modeling of ligand interactions with the CI&#8208;M6P/IGF2R domains further elucidated the binding mechanisms, offering new directions for the development of more effective ligands. This study advances the design of therapeutic strategies that leverage CI&#8208;M6P/IGF2R for targeted biomolecule delivery to lysosomes, thereby opening new possibilities for biomedical applications.

         <title>Unveiling New Triazoloquinoxaline&#8208;Based PROTACs Designed for the Selective Degradation of the ncBAF Chromatin Remodeling Subunit BRD9</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present new BRD9&#8208;targeting degraders featuring a chemical warhead and E3 ligase ligand that distinctly differ from the typical chemical units used for BRD9 degradation. Specifically, we identified two VHL&#8208;based PROTACs (2 and 9) based on a [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3&#8208;a]quinoxaline scaffold that effectively and selectively degrade BRD9 and exhibit antiproliferative effects in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, offering potential strategies for AML treatment and insights into BRD9's role in tumors.








Abstract
PROteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) technology is an innovative and potent approach for achieving targeted protein degradation (TPD). Within bromodomain&#8208;containing proteins, various degraders targeting BET family&#8208;related targets, for example, BRD4, were developed in the last years. On the other hand, a limited number of PROTACs acting against non&#8208;BET proteins were reported so far. Among them, BRD9 was recently linked to oncogenic roles in the tumorigenesis processes, especially in sarcomas and leukemias. Herein, we describe the design and synthesis of a focused collection of new BRD9&#8208;targeting degraders based on the [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3&#8208;a]quinoxaline heterocyclic scaffold employing two distinct E3 ubiquitin ligase ligands. Through in silico evaluation, synthesis, binding affinity determination, and in vitro analysis, we identified two new VHL&#8208;based PROTACs (2 and 9), which showed remarkable degradation of the protein of interest and antiproliferative activity in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Notably, compound 9 exhibited selective degradation of BRD9 over BRD7. These results enlarge and differentiate the pool of heterobifunctional molecules able to degrade BRD9 through the proteasome machinery, providing a promising reference for the discovery of new tools to further explore both the involvement of this epigenetic regulatory factor in tumor processes and to evaluate novel strategies for AML treatment.

         <title>Oxidative Folding of a Two&#8208;Chain Protein Having Three Interchain Disulfide Bonds. Synthesis of Bromelain Inhibitor VI Through Native Chain Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bromelain inhibitor VI, a two&#8208;chain protein stabilized by three interchain SS bonds and two intrachain SS bonds, was synthesized in an incredibly high isolated yield (53%) just by mixing the two native chains in a buffer solution. This success made a record of oxidative protein folding for the most complicated and difficult one.








Abstract
The recently renovated two&#8208;chain folding method, in which two native peptide chains without any sidechain protections and interchain scaffolds are just mixed in a buffer solution under optimized conditions, called native chain assembly (NCA), enabled efficient chemical synthesis of &#945;&#8208;helix&#8208;rich insulin and its analogs, which are stabilized by two interchain disulfide (SS) bridges. Herein, this simple folding method has been successfully applied to the folding of a different&#8208;type two&#8208;chain protein, that is, bromelain inhibitor VI (BI&#8208;VI), which has abundant &#946;&#8208;sheet structures and is stabilized by three interchain SS bridges. When the chemically synthesized native heavy (H)&#8208; and light (L)&#8208;chains of BI&#8208;VI were mixed at 4&#160;&#176;C in a pH of 10.0 buffer solution containing 2&#160;mM GSH and 0.4&#160;mM GSSG, native BI&#8208;VI was obtained surprisingly in a high isolated yield (53%) after 2 weeks. The obtained BI&#8208;VI showed complete inhibitory activity against bromelain, whereas each component chain exhibited essentially non&#8208;activity. The rate&#8208;limiting step of the two&#8208;chain folding was assumed to be the chain coupling between three&#8208;SS intermediates of the H&#8208;chain (3SSH) and one&#8208;SS intermediates of the L&#8208;chain (1SSL). This achievement opens a door to the chemical synthesis of unprecedent multichain proteins with more complicated SS&#8208;bond topologies.

         <title>Anion Exchange Polyelectrolytes with High Branching Ratio and Adjustable Free Volume for Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of anion exchange polyelectrolytes with wide&#8208;ranged branching ratio (BR) and fractional free volume (FFV) were synthesized to meet the discrepant requirements for anion exchange membranes (AEMs) and ionomers (AEIs). By controlling BR, the resulting stable and porosity&#8208;adjustable structures not only address the conductivity&#8211;toughness trade&#8208;off for AEMs but also meet the opposite gas permeation demands of AEMs and AEIs.








Abstract
Rational design of polyelectrolytes that simultaneously meets the requirements for anion exchange membrane (AEM) and ionomer (AEI), especially the opposite gas permeation demands for anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) with similar chemical structure is challenging. To overcome the formation of insoluble gel at high branching ratio (BR), herein, a series of anion exchange polyelectrolytes of intrinsic microporosity with wide&#8208;ranged fractional free volume and good solubility at high BR are fabricated through a stepwise nonstoichiometric superacid&#8208;catalyzed polycondensation reaction. By precisely controlling the BR and free volume, a stable and porosity&#8208;adjustable structure is generated, which not only addresses the conductivity&#8211;toughness trade&#8208;off of AEM but also possesses high OH&#8722; conductivity for AEI. Most importantly, it fulfills the opposite gas permeation demands for AEM and AEI and decreases the overpotentials of ohmic polarization and mass transport by 76.2% and 44.2%, respectively. The membrane electrode assembly fabricated by the optimized AEM and AEI achieves 1.98&#160;V (pure water) and 1.62&#160;V (1&#160;M KOH) at 1 A cm&#8722;2 with high stability. This work provides a strategy for rational design of polyelectrolytes that meets the requirements of AEM and AEI for high&#8208;performance AEMWE.

         <title>Pulsed Strategy Steers the Structural Evolution of Cu Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for CO2 Reduction to Methane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pulsed electrolysis enables the controlled reconstruction of Cu&#8208;DMTZ MOF into Cu2O/CuO active sites, which achieves an exceptional Faradaic efficiency of 82.9% for methane production from CO2 electroreduction, markedly outperforming that in potentiostatic electrolysis mode.








Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to produce hydrocarbon fuels, such as methane (CH4), offers a promising pathway to address the dual challenges of climate change and energy shortage. Although copper&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Cu&#8208;MOFs) have proven to be promising CO2RR catalysts for hydrocarbon production, their uncontrollable structural reconstruction under operating conditions leads to elusive active sites. Herein, we demonstrate that a pulsed potential electrolysis strategy with well&#8208;designed pulse parameters can steer the dynamic reconstruction of Cu&#8208;MOFs to customize the active sites to enable the CH4 formation pathway. Mechanistic studies using electron microscopic and spectroscopic methods indicated that constant&#8208;potential electrolysis caused the rapid reduction of Cu&#8208;MOF to metallic Cu nanoparticles, whereas pulsed electrolysis enabled the controlled generation of active Cu2O/CuO nanoclusters. Benefiting from this, the pulsed system delivers an exceptional Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 82.9% in CH4 production from the CO2RR. This selectivity markedly surpasses that of the constant&#8208;potential counterpart, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. In addition, this approach facilitates stable CH4 production for over 12&#160;hours while maintaining an FE above 60%.

         <dc:description>We wish to report the first total synthesis of (+)&#8208;disorazole Z1 a biologically extremely potent natural product (picomolar cytotoxicity) with complex molecular architecture featuring a 26&#8208;membered macrodiolide with lateral chains including a quaternary chiral carbon center. The complex acyclic lateral chains containing a stereochemical triad with the quaternary center surrounded by two hindered secondary alcohols were synthesized in a straightforward way by the use of two consecutive and highly diastereoselective aldol reactions with a lactone intermediate and further transformations to yield the desired (Z)&#8208;vinyl iodide. Successful esterification with a functionalized diene&#8208;stannane yielded the fully elaborated carbon skeleton. Making use of the C2&#8208;symmetry of the natural product a double Stille coupling gave the protected natural product. Final deprotection provided (+)&#8208;disorazole Z1 which was fully identical with a natural sample.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (2 nm) decorated with a high density of photochemically switchable ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (2 nm) were surface&#8208;coated with photoswitchable 3&#8208;azopyridine ligands by ligand exchange with n&#8208;dodecanethiol&#8208;stabilized gold nanoparticles. Each gold nanoparticle carried about 66 dodecanethiol ligands and 49 azo ligands. The azo ligands were reversibly switchable between the stable E&#8208; and the metastable Z&#8208;isomer by UV and green light irradiation as shown by UV&#8208;Vis and NMR spectroscopy. The photoswitching was not significantly affected by the conjugation of the azo ligand to the nanoparticle surface, despite the high density of ligands on the particle surface. This offers a pathway for photoswitchable systems on the nanoscale, e.g. to manipulate supramolecular systems. The introduction of 0.5 wt% of the nanoparticles into a liquid crystalline host yielded a photoresponsive material which showed a reversible nematic&#8208;to&#8208;isotropic phase transition upon irradiation</dc:description>

A convenient strategy by synergistic delivering DNA and DNA photocleavage agents to tumor cells was developed for effective photodynamic immunotherapy under hypoxia.








Abstract
Plasmid DNAs intercalated with Ru(II) complexes were encapsulated in liposomes to create nano&#8208;photosensitizers. Upon light exposure, the ruthenium complex photo&#8208;cleavages DNA. The DNA fragments specifically stimulate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway and induce immunogenic death. This study presents a convenient strategy for photodynamic immunotherapy against cisplatin&#8208;resistant tumor cells under hypoxia.

         <title>Alkyl&#8208;&#960; Liquids as Condensed&#8208;State Singlet Oxygen Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquids are non&#8208;volatile single&#8208;component condensed&#8208;state functional materials that generate singlet oxygen (1O2) at an alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquid&#8208;water interface. Chromophores can be incorporated into alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquids that produce 1O2 and membrane impregnated systems can be fabricated to generate 1O2 that migrates across a membrane&#8208;water interface to destroy small organic molecules, demonstrating the potential for water decontamination.








Abstract
Functional materials capable of generating singlet oxygen (1O2), a highly reactive but short&#8208;lived species used to destroy organic materials, including chemical pollutants and biological entities, typically incorporate a chromophore that acts as a photosensitizer into a tertiary scaffold. Current functional materials that produce 1O2 include metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs), polymeric nanoparticles, modified glasses, and supramolecular assemblies. Whilst multi&#8208;component functional materials have been widely reported, producing functional materials using a single small molecule in a condensed state has hardly been reported. Herein, we report the first use of functional molecular liquids (alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquids), non&#8208;volatile single&#8208;component condensed&#8208;state fluidic materials, as photosensitizers for the generation of 1O2 at an alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquid&#8208;water interface. We investigate the incorporation of various chromophores into alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquids that are suitable for 1O2 production and analyze the molecular structure required to produce efficient alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquid photosensitizers. The alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquids were studied, impregnated into porous membranes, and as thin films on quartz and Si wafers, the limitations of 1O2 production were investigated. A system was successfully fabricated that can generate 1O2 within an alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquid impregnated membrane and migrate across a membrane&#8208;water interface to destroy small organic molecules, demonstrating the potential of these systems for water decontamination.

Chromophores can be incorporated into alkyl-&#960; liquids that produce &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and membrane impregnated systems can be fabricated to generate &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that migrates across a membrane-water interface to destroy small organic molecules, demonstrating the potential for water decontamination.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functional materials capable of generating singlet oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), a highly reactive but short-lived species used to destroy organic materials, including chemical pollutants and biological entities, typically incorporate a chromophore that acts as a photosensitizer into a tertiary scaffold. Current functional materials that produce &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; include metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent-organic frameworks (COFs), polymeric nanoparticles, modified glasses, and supramolecular assemblies. Whilst multi-component functional materials have been widely reported, producing functional materials using a single small molecule in a condensed state has hardly been reported. Herein, we report the first use of functional molecular liquids (alkyl-&#960; liquids), non-volatile single-component condensed-state fluidic materials, as photosensitizers for the generation of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at an alkyl-&#960; liquid-water interface. We investigate the incorporation of various chromophores into alkyl-&#960; liquids that are suitable for &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production and analyze the molecular structure required to produce efficient alkyl-&#960; liquid photosensitizers. The alkyl-&#960; liquids were studied, impregnated into porous membranes, and as thin films on quartz and Si wafers, the limitations of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production were investigated. A system was successfully fabricated that can generate &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; within an alkyl-&#960; liquid impregnated membrane and migrate across a membrane-water interface to destroy small organic molecules, demonstrating the potential of these systems for water decontamination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Affinity&#8208;Based Protein Profiling Reveals IDH2 as a Mitochondrial Target of Cannabinol in Receptor&#8208;Independent Neuroprotection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemical probe CBN&#8208;P based on the neuroprotective cannabinoid cannabinol (CBN) was developed and synthesized. CNB&#8208;P was found to have a similar mechanism of action as the parent compound and was used in click&#8208;CLEM microscopy studies and affinity&#8208;based protein profiling to identify the mitochondrial protein isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) as one target of CBN.








Abstract
Phytocannabinoids are attracting growing attention because of their potential for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Among them, the &#8220;minor&#8221; cannabinoid, cannabinol (CBN), has emerged as a promising neuroprotective agent, acting independently of classical cannabinoid receptors through as&#8208;yet unidentified mitochondrial targets. To uncover the molecular basis of its neuroprotective effects, we designed and synthesized a chemical probe based on CBN, incorporating a minimalist diazirine linker. Functional assays confirmed that the probe retains CBN's mitochondrial activity and exhibits strong mitochondrial enrichment, as demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy and click&#8208;correlative light and electron microscopy (click&#8208;CLEM). By affinity&#8208;based protein profiling (AfBPP), we identified isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) as a key mitochondrial target of CBN. This finding was further substantiated by siRNA knockdown studies, which revealed that the absence of IDH2 partially phenocopies CBN's effects, validating its role as a critical mediator of CBN's neuroprotective activity.

         <title>Comprehensive Analysis of Crystalline Hydrophobic Alkylated Poly(ethyleneimine)s</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkylation of polyethyleneimine (PEI) induces crystalline hydrophobic domains, critical for CO&#8322;&#8208;mediated desalination. Structural evolution during acid/base treatment and ion exchange is revealed by PXRD, SAXS, and inelastic neutron scattering. Findings highlight reversible domain disruption and nanostructure formation, enabling recyclable polymer performance in water purification and CO&#8322; capture.








Abstract
Polyethyleneimine (PEI) is a widely used polymer in catalysis, gas separation, water treatment, drug delivery, textiles, and paper production. Carbon dioxide can act as a molecular stimulus for amine&#8208;rich polymers such as PEIs, a property that has been exploited in CO&#8322;&#8208;mediated desalination. This process entails amine&#8208;mediated CO&#8322; capture and the in situ formation of bicarbonate ions, which subsequently undergo ion exchange with chloride ions present in both model and real seawater. In this study, we prepared a series of alkylated PEIs with different chainlengths (C4&#8208;C18) and degrees of alkylation (10&#8208;40% alkylation) via simple alkylation as previously reported. The obtained hydrophobic PEI, specifically PEI&#8208;C16, was further investigated in terms of its crystalline structure using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, thermogravimetric analysis, and inelastic neutron scattering. Based on our analysis, we conclude that the subtle structural changes of hydrophobic poly(ethyleneimine)s were induced by acid&#8208;mediated protonation and ion exchange, while the polymer maintained its integrity across multiple desalination cycles. These findings advocate for the employment of hydrophobic poly(ethyleneimine) in CO&#8322;&#8208;responsive processes and carbon capture applications.

         <title>Polypyrrole as a photothermal reactor to conduct solvent&#8208;free pericyclic reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solvent&#8208;free organic reactions have proved to be sustainable and efficient strategy in organic synthesis. Current solvent&#8208;free approaches include mechanochemical, microwave&#8208;assisted, and ultrasound&#8208;irradiated methods. As a complementary strategy, photothermal materials may also be used in solvent&#8208;free chemistry, offering the advantage of utilizing eco&#8208;friendly solar energy. Polypyrroles, the black conjugated polymers, feature facile synthesis, high stability and excellent light&#8208;harvesting capability, enabling it to server as photothermal reactors to conduct solvent&#8208;free thermal&#8208;induced reactions. Here, a series of polypyrrole materials have been synthesized in the presence of various surfactants. The usage of dodecyl dimethyl betaine afforded PPy&#8208;BS, which achieved a highest photothermal performance (241&#176;C under 100 W halogen&#8208;lamp irradiation). On this basis, PPy&#8208;BS was employed as a photothermal reactor for Diels&#8208;Alder, dipolar cycloaddition, and electrocyclization reactions under solvent&#8208;free conditions. All trials work well, affording good to excellent yields up to 90%. Notably, PPy&#8208;BS photothermal reactor exhibits excellent recyclability (over eight cycles without loss of the yields of the conducted model reactions), high loading amount of substrates, and upscaling to 1000 mg per batch. In brief, this study highlights the advantages of PPy&#8208;BS photothermal reactors for pericyclic reactions, offering a recyclable, up&#8208;scalable, and solvent&#8208;free platform for sustainable organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Helical Metallocryptand for Size&#8208;Selective Recognition of Amino Acid Derivatives with Aliphatic Side Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The novel tris(salen)&#8208;type metallocryptand, LNi3, was designed and synthesized. Its crystallographic analysis revealed the presence as a helical enantiomeric pair, right&#8208;handed (P) and left&#8208;handed (M) forms, rather than the meso&#8208;form, which was energetically supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This LNi3 host was capable of recognizing amino acid derivatives by several non&#8208;covalent interactions, showing a selectivity to those bearing an aliphatic side chain. Its shape&#8208;persistent nature of the cryptand facilitated the size&#8208;based discrimination, which was clearly demonstrated by 1H NMR spectroscopic titration studies. Recognition of some of the guests caused the emergence of CD signals, indicating the biased P/M helix inversion equilibrium of LNi3. Three aliphatic side&#8208;chain guests, Val, Ile, and Leu, caused an M&#8208;favored shifting, while two &#960;&#8208;containing side&#8208;chain guests, Arg and Trp, showed the preference to the P&#8208;form. This metallocryptand, LNi3, overcomes the limitation in recognition of less polar amino acids having an alkyl side chain and provided future applications in molecular recognition, biochemical sensing, and enantiomeric sensing.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Inorganic&#8208;Organic Rotaxanes and Related Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The extension of previous studies of heterometallic rings (HMRs) is described, including new synthetic chemistry and physics. These HMRs feature a ring of, typically, eight&#8208;metal centres with a central charge balancing cation. New HMRs and related molecules are described, varying the number of metals present. The eight&#8208;metal HMRs have been used as components of larger supramolecular assembly, most often by making the HMRs into [2]rotaxanes or pseudo&#8208;rotaxanes, where the thread of the rotaxane is terminated by a binding group such as pyridine. This allows the formation of [n]rotaxanes, where n = 3, 4, 5,7, 13 or 1014. Mass spectrometry and NMR studies of the HMRs have given greater understanding of the host&#8208;guest chemistry of these metal analogues of crown ethers. Physical studies have included 4D&#8208;inelastic neutron scattering and continuous wave and pulsed EPR spectroscopy to measure magnetic interactions between spin components of the supramolecular assemblies. The use of the HMRs as resists for high resolution lithography is also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Chloride Double Perovskites Doped with Sb3+/Er3+ as Stable and Effective Luminescence Materials in the Vis&#8208;NIR Region</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The luminescence properties of stable halide double perovskites Cs2BIInCl6, where BI &#8211; 40% Ag, 60% Na, doped with Sb3+ and Er3+ in the region 250&#8208;1600 nm were investigated for the first time and reveal significant potential for advanced application. We employed XPS and TOF&#8208;SIMS for chemical analyses, while SEM, XRD, and Raman Spectroscopy provided insights into the morphology, crystal structure, and vibrational characteristics of the samples. The crystal structures of Cs2Ag0.292Na0.708InCl6, Cs2Ag0.285Na0.715In0.971Er0.029Cl6, Cs2Ag0.16Na0.84In0.893Er0.017Sb0.09Cl6 were examined using single&#8208;crystal methods. The excited Sb3+ ions emit blue light at 450 nm due to electronic absorption at sub&#8208;band gap levels, facilitating energy transfer to Er3+ ions. Notably, the Er3+ emit radiation at 1540 nm, a wavelength particularly advantageous for optical communication applications. Additionally, emissions at 525 nm, 552 nm, 665 nm and 805 nm are observed, corresponding to f&#8208;f transitions of Er3+ ions. These compelling results have been supported by calculations based on Modified Crystal Field Theory, elucidating the effects of varying concentrations of Sb3+ and Er3+ on the crystal structure and luminescent properties. Leveraging the synthesized materials, we successfully have developed a LED prototype that utilizes a UV chip &#160;combined with the Cs2Ag0.4Na0.6In0.9Er0.01Sb0.09Cl6 powder as a stable and effective luminophore for optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxygen Vacancies and Phosphorus&#8208;Doped P&#8208;WO 3&#8208;x /CC&#160;Electrocatalysts Boosting Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing non&#8208;precious metal electrocatalysts with good hydrogen evolution activity is crucial for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media. The synergistic optimization of the water dissociation and hydrogen desorption steps presents a challenge for the HER.&#160;Here,&#160;we &#160;have synthesized&#160;phosphorus&#8208;doped tungsten trioxide with oxygen vacancies (P&#8208;WO3&#8208;x) using a simple but&#160;effective hydrothermal reaction followed by calcination annealing.&#160;Interestingly, the P&#8208;WO3&#8208;x material exhibits unique characteristics that set it apart from conventional tungsten oxide&#8208;based electrocatalysts. The introduction of oxygen vacancies and phosphorus doping creates an optimal structure that significantly improves the electronic properties and the catalytic sites. The oxygen vacancies enhance the material&#8217;s ability to adsorb and activate water molecules, while phosphorus doping further modifies the electronic structure, facilitating more efficient hydrogen desorption. Meanwhile, the catalyst demonstrates a favorable urchin&#8208;like morphology&#160;with excellent supportability. Remarkably, the P&#8208;WO3&#8208;x&#160;electrocatalyst demonstrates excellent HER performance and excellent durability.&#160;We indicate that P&#8208;WO3&#8208;x exhibits&#160;a small overpotential (155.42 mV at &#8208;10 mA cm&#8208;2), a low Tafel slope (74.97 mV dec&#8208;1), and excellent durability over 12 hours. This work presents a significant advance for the development of tungsten oxide&#8208;based electrocatalysts&#160;with&#160;anion doping and oxygen vacancies&#160;for HER in acidic media.</dc:description>

         <title>A ketol&#8208;acid reductoisomerase inhibitor that has antituberculosis and herbicidal activity.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ketol&#8208;acid reductoisomerase (KARI) is a target for the development of new biocidal agents. This is based on its essential role in branched chain amino acid biosynthesis in plants and microorganisms, and its absence in animals. The lack of success in developing KARI inhibitors as biocides may be because the inhibitors assessed to date compete directly with the substrate, 2&#8208;acetolactate (AL). As a result, effectiveness diminishes when AL accumulates in cells. Furthermore, as these inhibitors are slow binding, an organism could avoid growth slowdown by increasing KARI production. Here, we show a pyrimidinedione,&#160;1f&#160;is a competitive but time&#8208;dependent inhibitor of AL and NADPH for&#160;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&#160;(Mt) KARI (Ki&#160;= 23.3 nM). A crystal structure of this compound bound to the&#160;MtKARI homolog from&#160;Staphylococcus aureus&#160;(Sa),&#160;SaKARI, illustrates this dual competition. In contrast, for&#160;Oryza sativa&#160;KARI, no time&#8208;dependent inhibition by&#160;1f&#160;is observed, though it inhibits AL competitively (146 nM) and NADPH uncompetitively. Despite differences in inhibition properties,&#160;1f&#160;has an MIC of 12.7 &#181;M for&#160;MtH37Rv and inhibits&#160;Brassica campestris&#160;growth by 63% at 10 mg/mL. Therefore, KARI inhibitors that are competitive for NADPH and show no time dependent inhibition have excellent potential as biocides.</dc:description>

         <title>DFT&#8208;Guided Synthesis, Electrochemical and Photophysical Properties of Ruthenium(II) Polypyridyl Complexes Featuring Flavin&#8208;Inspired &#960;&#8208;Extended Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;driven electron transfer and subsequent multielectron storage is among the key aspects of photochemical reactions in artificial photosynthesis and molecular electronics. Following our previously introduced design and characterization of Ru(II)&#8208;based photosensitizers, four new Ru complexes with &#960;&#8208;extended ligands featuring a flavin&#8208;inspired subunit were investigated via density functional theory in order to evaluate their electrochemical properties ahead of a time and resource demanding synthesis. Two complexes, Ru&#8208;Me2alloxB and Ru&#8208;Me2deazaalloxB, with a bent ligand architecture, were identified as promising candidates for application in light&#8208;driven charge accumulation and synthesized subsequently. The electrochemical characterization of Ru&#8208;Me2alloxB confirmed the theoretical predictions and its photophysical properties were investigated using UV/Vis absorption, resonance Raman, time&#8208;resolved emission and time&#8208;resolved absorption spectroscopy in combination with quantum chemical simulations. Furthermore, first insights into the electronic distribution in the singly&#8208;reduced complex were modeled computationally and obtained by EPR and UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy and spectroelectrochemistry. These results underline the promising multielectron storage capacity of the newly&#8208;designed &#960;&#8208;extended alloxazine ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>ENHANCED POLYSULFIDE REGULATION IN RECHARGEABLE LI&#8208;S BATTERIES WITH ZnS AS ELECTROCATALYST: EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION AND INTERFACIAL INSIGHTS FROM SIMULATIONS</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) battery cathode based on a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)&#8208;decorated ZnS nanosphere structure, which serves as a multifunctional sulfur host. The rGO framework provides a high&#8208;surface&#8208;area conductive network for enhanced sulfur loading, while ZnS acts as an electrocatalyst to accelerate polysulfide conversion. Fabricated via a one&#8208;step hydrothermal method, the composite achieves a high sulfur content (~80%) with efficient polysulfide confinement and catalytic conversion as a Li&#8208;S battery cathode. As a result, it delivers an initial capacity of 1014 mAh/g at 0.1 C and retains 592 mAh/g at 1C, demonstrating excellent rate capability and cycling stability (479 mAh/g over 200 cycles at 1C). To further understand the interfacial interactions, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted, revealing the role of ZnS in accelerating lithium polysulfide (LiPS) conversion, particularly from Li&#8322;S&#8324; to Li&#8322;S. The study analyzed LiPS diffusion coefficients and potential energy across different sulfur species, confirming the superior efficiency of the rGO@ZnS host. These findings highlight the potential of ZnS&#8208;decorated rGO structures as a promising approach to improving Li&#8208;S battery performance through enhanced sulfur utilization and polysulfide regulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Insights and Advanced Spectroscopic Characterization of Thiazolothiazoles: Unveiling Potential for Optoelectronic and Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiazolothiazoles (TzTzs) are planar, &#960;&#8208;conjugated heterocyclic compounds exhibiting unique structural and optoelectronic properties. In this study, a series of symmetrically substituted TzTz derivatives including imidazolyl, o&#8208;vanillyl, p&#8208;vanillyl, phenyl, thiazolyl, cinnamoyl, and trifluoromethylphenyl were synthesized and extensively characterized using X&#8208;ray crystallography (XRD), Fourier&#8208;transformed infrared (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV&#8208;Vis) spectroscopies, photoluminescence, X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES, S K&#8208;edge), and density functional calculations. The compounds demonstrated diverse intermolecular interactions, including &#960;&#215;&#215;&#215;&#960; stacking and chalcogen bonding, which directly influenced their optical properties and electronic band structures. Several derivatives displayed promising features such as large Stokes shifts over 0.4 eV in solution and up to 1 eV in solid state, and reversible resistive switching behavior, positioning them as attractive candidates for use in optoelectronic devices and emerging memristive technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Wheel Movement in a [2]Rotaxane Using a Competing Kinetic Pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Wheel movement of rotaxanes is typically fast in solution. Therefore, real&#8208;time monitoring of such movement is one of the challenging topics. Herein, we report real&#8208;time monitoring of wheel movement in a [2]rotaxane (comprising hydrophilic pillar[5]arene as a wheel and hydrophobic &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety with hydrophilic tetra(ethylene oxide) ends as an axle) via a competing kinetic pathway, i.e., aggregation/dissociation equilibrium. In non&#8208;aqueous solvent, the [2]rotaxane shows blue&#8211;purple locally excited emission from the &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety because the pillar[5]arene wheel shuttles over the whole axle. In aqueous solvent, the [2]rotaxane forms aggregates owing to its amphiphilic nature. Because the [2]rotaxane forms the kinetically stable aggregates, location of the pillar[5]arene wheel on the axle is maintained, resulting in the locally excited emission even in the polar conditions. Surprisingly, the emission color gradually changes from blue&#8211;purple to light&#8208;blue over 720 h because exposure of the monomeric [2]rotaxane generated by dissociation of the kinetically stable aggregates, to the polar environment triggers movement of the hydrophilic wheel to the hydrophobic &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety by hydrophobic effect. After this movement, the monomeric [2]rotaxane forms the thermodynamically stable aggregates, which exhibit light&#8208;blue emission from charge&#8208;transfer complex between the electron&#8208;donating pillar[5]arene wheel and the electron&#8208;accepting &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Oxidation of Alcohols with Organic Dyes: from Homogeneous Systems to Sensitized Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxidation of alcohols retains an enormous importance in industry and in synthetic organic chemistry. The renaissance in photocatalysis is offering new routes to conduct this class of transformations under benign and sustainable conditions. In this concept article, we highlight the efforts that have been conducted in light driven oxidation of alcohols using organic photocatalysts. After an overview of relevant industrial processes, we will discuss relevant examples of organic photocatalysts employed in solution, or when integrated in photosynthetic schemes within semiconductor slides or nanoparticles. The combination of the photochemical systems with electrochemical routes or their engineering in flow will be considered. Where possible, we highlight also mechanistic aspects that reveal the key steps involved and contribute to improve the performance of the process. We finally present an outlook on the future perspectives and developments in the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Near&#8208;infrared Circularly Polarized Luminescence Activity in Fluorinated Binolate Ytterbium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral lanthanide complexes hold great potential in developing advanced circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials in the near infrared (NIR) wavelength range. While various ligands, such as &#946;&#8208;diketonates and biphenols, have been successfully used to sensitize NIR emission of lanthanide ions, little attention has been paid to regulating CPL behaviors via ligand modification. In this study, we report the synthesis, structure, luminescence and chiroptical properties of a pair of novel air&#8208;stable Shibasaki&#8208;type Yb(III) enantiomers supported by 3,3&#8217;&#8208;fluorinated binaphthol (F2BINOL). Compared to their non&#8208;fluorinated counterparts, these fluorinated complexes exhibit larger dihedral angles between the two naphthyl moieties and more distorted octahedral coordination environments around the Yb(III) ion, leading to increased overall crystal field splitting. These structural modifications result in enhanced photophysical properties: the luminescence lifetime (&#964;obs), sensitization efficiency (&#951;sens) and quantum yield (QY) improve from 2.1 &#956;s, 38% and 0.7% to 2.7 &#956;s, 63% and 1.8%, respectively. Additionally, the dissymmetry factor (glum) and CPL brightness (BCPL) at 963 nm increase by 32% and one order of magnitude, respectively. The scope of such chemical modification is broad,&#160;encompassing a variety of BINOL derivatives, offering a unique platform to further elucidate the relationship between structural and electronic properties and CPL activity in lanthanide systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Detergent Chemistry and Handling Support Membrane Protein Analysis Including Lipid Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;ionic detergents are key reagents for the characterization of membrane protein drug targets. Suitable detergents are commonly identified by trial and error, which leads to failed preparations and raising costs. Recent findings suggest that not only the chemistry of detergents but also the strategy with which detergents and proteins are brought together impact the successes of investigations. To facilitate the future development of non&#8208;ionic detergents in membrane protein research, herein, we review chemical design concepts and detergent exchange strategies for a successful integration of detergents into the analysis of challenging membrane protein complexes. Our overview reveals exciting opportunities to tackle existing challenges, including the stabilization of G&#8208;protein coupled receptors, the development of fluorinated detergents for studying protein&#8208;lipid binding, top&#8208;down design of detergents, and hybrid detergents for the identification of non&#8208;canonical lipid associations to proteins with relevance to antibiotic research. Our review will facilitate the development of chemical tools for the biophysical characterization of membrane proteins and support the discovery of biological findings in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>A Flexible, Perfluorinated Analogue of Aluminum Fumarate Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the synthesis of Al&#8208;TFS, a novel aluminum metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) based on tetrafluorosuccinic acid (H2TFS), of formula Al(OH)(TFS)&#183;1.5H2O, introducing a new member to the family of perfluorinated MOFs. The structure of the MOF, solved ab&#8208;initio from laboratory powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data, displays structural analogies with that of the commercially available Al&#8208;fumarate (Basolite A520). The structure is composed of 1D infinite OH&#8208;bridged Al octahedra chains connected by the dicarboxylic linkers, designing rhombic channels decorated by fluorine atoms. Upon water removal, the MOF undergoes a phase transition leading to a moderate expansion of the unit cell. Volumetric analysis revealed the presence of ultra&#8208;micropores with a size lower than 4 &#197;. Gas sorption measurements demonstrated for Al&#8208;TFS a slightly higher CO2 selectivity compared to N2 and CH4 than the Al&#8208;fumarate analogue, with peculiar shapes of the isotherms suggesting a dynamic response of the framework to CO2 adsorption. Using different complementary techniques (in situ infrared spectroscopy, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, gas/vapor sorption), and density functional theory simulations, the flexibility of the new MOF was disclosed, highlighting the significant impact of fluorination in tailoring materials with structural flexibility and peculiar adsorption properties.</dc:description>
