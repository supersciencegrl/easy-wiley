         <title>Bis&#8208;Squaramide&#8208;Based [2]Rotaxane Hosts for Anion Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first examples of bis&#8208;squaramide axle containing [2]rotaxanes linked via rigid aryl and flexible alkyl spacers synthesised using copper(I) catalysed active metal template methodology are reported. The halide and oxoanion binding properties of the [2]rotaxanes in aqueous&#8208;organic solvent media are examined through extensive 1H&#8208;NMR titration experiments to investigate the impact of integrating multiple squaramide motifs on the anion binding capabilities of the interlocked receptors. These studies reveal that the bis&#8208;squaramide rotaxane host systems exhibit enhanced halide anion binding capabilities relative to a mono&#8208;squaramide axle functionalised rotaxane, demonstrating a rare anti&#8208;Hofmeister bias halide anion selectivity trend in aqueous&#8208;organic mixtures and highlighting the efficacy of the potent solvent shielded hydrophobic interlocked binding pocket created upon mechanical bond formation. Notably, employing a rigid aryl linker between the two squaramide motifs in the axle component enables the rotaxane host to exhibit strong and selective binding of tetrahedral oxoanions. Conversely, a flexible alkyl spacer facilitates trigonal oxoanion selective recognition by the bis&#8208;squaramide [2]rotaxane.</dc:description>

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;attached (NHC)Gold(I) and (NHC)Copper(I) Complexes as Photoswitchable Catalysts</title>

         <dc:description>Photoswitchable (pre)catalysts, N,N'&#8208;bis&#8208;azobenzene&#8208;based (NHC)gold(I) and N,N'&#8208;bis&#8208;azobenzene&#8208;derived (NHC)copper(I) complexes are reported. Trans to cis isomerization of the attached photoswitchable moieties in the Au(I) complex enables four&#8208;fold decrement in the rate of oxazoline formation reaction. Whereas the progress of the copper(I) catalyzed, azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition reaction gets reduced by at least threefold. Alternate exposure to UV and blue light could easily toggle the rate of reactions remotely. The catalytic activity of thermodynamically stable trans&#8208;trans isomers is found to be similar to the common N&#8208;aryl substituted NHC&#8208;Au/Cu(I) complexes. NHC&#8208;Au(I) and &#8208;Cu(I) compounds bearing (trans)azobenzene moieties were characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Photoswitching, recyclability studies, and the metastable isomer's thermal half&#8208;life in both complexes were studied via UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy. Whereas the extent of photoswitching and concomitant formation of geometrical isomers were investigated by using&#160;1H&#8208;NMR&#160;spectroscopic study. Calculated percentage buried volumes of the three geometrical isomers show the trend trans&#8208;trans &lt; trans&#8208;cis &lt; cis&#8208;cis.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalized &#945;&#8208;Cyanostilbene Derivatives for Detection of Hypoxia or Proteostasis Imbalance in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Cyanostilbene represents one of the easily functionalized aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) scaffolds. It has been widely adopted for the construction of fluorescent materials for broad applications. Here, we further expanded the utilization of &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbene derivatives for the detection of hypoxia or proteostasis imbalance in live cells. Four different amine containing donors were introduced to construct &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbene derivatives (R&#8208;ASC) with donor&#8208;acceptor scaffolds. Equipped with the cysteine (Cys) reactive group, maleimide (MI), R&#8208;ASC&#8208;MI shows fluorescence turn&#8208;on property upon binding with unfolded proteins in vitro and in live cells under proteostatic stress. By virtue of R&#8208;ASC&#8208;MI, the level of unfolded protein loads in cells can be quantified by flow cytometry, or visualized under microscope. Furthermore, we also characterized the performance of R&#8208;ASC&#8208;NO2, synthetic precursors of R&#8208;ASC&#8208;MI, in cellular hypoxia. R&#8208;ASC&#8208;NO2 revealed upregulated activities of nitroreductase, as well as increased hydrophobicity in live cells, under either chemical (NaN3) induced or atmospheric (1% O2) hypoxia. Together, the advantages of easy modification and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of new &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbene derivatives reported in this work highlight the great potential of &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbene in constructing functional biosensors and many other domains.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationships in Supramolecular Hosts Targeting Bacterial Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) Lipids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The World Health Organization has described the antimicrobial resistance crisis as one of the top ten global public health threats. New antimicrobial agents that can fight infections caused by antimicrobial resistant pathogens are therefore needed. A potential strategy is the development of small molecules that can selectively interact with bacterial membranes (or membranes of other microbial pathogens), and thereby rapidly kill the bacteria. Here, we report the structure&#8208;activity relationship within a group of 22 compounds that were designed to bind the bacterial lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Liposome&#8208;based studies reveal that the lipophilicity of the compounds has the strongest effect on both the affinity and selectivity for PE. The best results were obtained for compounds with logP &#8776; 3.75, which showed a 5x to 7x selectivity for bacterial PE lipids over human PC (phosphatidylcholine) lipids. Furthermore, these compounds also showed potent antibacterial activity against the Gram&#8208;positive bacterium B. cereus, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) below 10 &#181;M, a concentration where they showed minimal hemolytic activity against human red blood cells. These results not only show the possibility of PE&#8208;binding small molecules to function as antibiotics, but also provide guidelines for the development of compounds targeting other types of biologically relevant membrane lipids.</dc:description>

However, because of the low dielectric constant and high oxygen solubility in the fluorous phase, the brightness and photostability of the fluorofluorophores are significantly diminished. Here, we leveraged the tight ion pairing in the fluorous phase to improve the photophysical properties of a fluorous soluble pentamethine dye (FCy5) via counterion exchange. We found that larger, softer, fluorinated, aryl borate counterions promote the ideal polymethine state where charge delocalization across the polymethine chain increases the brightness (6&#8208;fold) and photostability (55&#8208;fold) of FCy5.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Methods for the Formation of Free Carbyne Radicals in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbyne free radicals RC&#8942; (RC) are usually associated with high&#8208;energy processes, thus research on their preparation, chemical reactivity, and prevalence under mild conditions is scarce. Recently, it was reported that metallo&#8208;complexes containing CR ligands may undergo spontaneous degradation in aqueous solutions to produce free RC radicals. These highly reactive species may react with each other to form the corresponding alkyne and other products. The reaction of 1,1,1 halo&#8208;carbo&#8208;hydrates with Cr(II) ions also forms RC radicals under mild conditions. Herein, we report two additional synthetic routes that produce free RC radicals under mild conditions. First, the reaction between metallic zinc and acetic anhydride produces 2&#8208;butyne and several other C2, C3, and C4 compounds. Isotopic&#8208;labeling experiments indicate that the formation of 2&#8208;butyne results from an inter&#8208;molecular reaction in which two RC moieties from two acetic anhydride molecules combine in solution. In addition, the degradation of the tri&#8208;molybdenum complex [Mo3(H3CC&#8801;CCH3)(OAc)(H2O)2Br7], in which a 2&#8208;butyne ligand is coordinated to the Mo3 framework in a &#956;3&#8208;&#951;2 (&#8869;) binding mode in aqueous solution produces several C2, C3, C4 and C5 molecules. This indicates the formation of free CH3C radicals by a homolytic cleavage of the carbon&#8208;carbon triple bond.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Vacancy Enriched Porous BN Fibers for Enhanced Polysulfides Adsorption and Conversion in High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presented herein centers on the fabrication of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) BN fibers with abundant pores and sufficient N&#8208;vacancy defects, achieved through a unique strategy of thermal crystallization following a pre&#8208;condensation step. After incorporating these fibers with highly interweaved bacterial cellulose (BC) followed by carbonization, the resulting Nv&#8208;BN@CBC exhibited higher specific capacity, superior rate capability, and more stable cycling performance.







Abstract
Severe shuttle effect of soluble polysulfides and sluggish redox kinetics have been thought of as the critical issues hindering the extensive applications of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Herein, one&#8208;dimensional boron nitride (1D BN) fibers with abundant pores and sufficient N&#8208;vacancy defects were synthesized using a thermal crystallization following a pre&#8208;condensation step. The 1D structure of BN facilitates unblocked ions diffusion pathways during charge/discharge cycles. The embedded pores within the polar BN strengthen the immobilization of polysulfides via both physical confinement and chemical interaction. Moreover, the highly exposed active surface area and intentionally created N&#8208;vacancy sites substantially promote reaction kinetics by lowering the energy barriers of the rate&#8208;limiting steps. After incorporating with conductive carbon networks and elemental S, the as&#8208;prepared S/Nv&#8208;BN@CBC cathode of LSBs deliver an initial discharge capacity of up to 1347&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, while maintaining a low decay rate of 0.03&#8201;% per cycle over 1000&#8197;cycles at 1600&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. This work offers an effective strategy to mitigate the shuttle effect and highlights the significant potential of defect&#8208;engineered BN in accelerating the reaction kinetics of LSBs.

         <title>A Peptide Strategy for Inhibiting Different Protein Aggregation Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
General peptide inhibitors of protein aggregation were developed by discovering the molecular determinants of inherent anti&#8208;aggregation activity. Substitutions maximizing &#960;&#8208;stacking, H&#8208;bonding and flexibility further enhanced the potency of natural inhibitors. So&#8208;designed peptides potently inhibited unrelated proteins aggregating via different mechanisms ranging from amorphous aggregation to Tau and Huntingtin amyloid aggregation.







Abstract
Protein aggregation correlates with many human diseases. Protein aggregates differ in structure and shape. Strategies to develop effective aggregation inhibitors that reach the clinic failed so far. Here, we developed a family of peptides targeting early aggregation stages for both amorphous and fibrillar aggregates of proteins unrelated in sequence and structure. They act on dynamic precursors before mechanistic differentiation takes place. Using peptide arrays, we first identified peptides inhibiting the amorphous aggregation of a molten globular, aggregation&#8208;prone mutant of the Axin tumor suppressor. Optimization revealed that the peptides activity did not depend on their sequences but rather on their molecular determinants: a composition of 20&#8211;30&#8201;% flexible, 30&#8211;40&#8201;% aliphatic and 20&#8211;30&#8201;% aromatic residues, a hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity ratio close to 1, and an even distribution of residues of different nature throughout the sequence. The peptides also suppressed fibrillation of Tau, a disordered protein that forms amyloids in Alzheimer's disease, and slowed down that of Huntingtin Exon1, an amyloidogenic protein in Huntington's disease, both entirely unrelated to Axin. Our compounds thus target early stages of different aggregation mechanisms, inhibiting both amorphous and amyloid aggregation. Such cross&#8208;mechanistic, multi&#8208;targeting aggregation inhibitors may be lead compounds for developing drug candidates against various protein aggregation diseases.

         <title>Water&#8208;Stable, Eight&#8208;electron Acceptor Drives Anion&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Water Assisted Tunable Ionic Self&#8208;Assembly and Proton Conduction</title>

         <dc:description>
A highly electron&#8208;deficient, water&#8208;stable, eight&#8208;electron acceptor scaffold has been used as a platform to realize proton conduction through ionic self&#8208;assembly. In this unique self&#8208;assembled material, 1D water tapes are revealed, that undergo hydrogen&#8208;bonding with halide anions, thereby generating a pathway for anion&#8208;assisted, tunable proton conduction.







Abstract
Organic &#960;&#8208;scaffolds are being envisaged for new&#8208;age electron&#8208; and ion&#8208;responsive materials that can accumulate electrons as well as transport proton. However, such systems are extremely rare as electron&#8208;deficient scaffolds are unstable in aqueous solution. Here we detail the synthesis of a water&#8208;stable core&#8208;naphthalenediimide&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;viologen based tetra&#8208;cation, which accumulates up to eight&#8208;electrons within an exceptionally narrow potential window of +0.05&#8197;V and &#8722;1.12&#8197;V. The supramolecular interactions and the ensuing ionic framework are tunable based on the three anions, e.&#8201;g., Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722; and PF6&#8722;, that are investigated in this work. The ionic framework is formed and supported by a range of H&#8208;bonds, in which, the nitro benzyl groups act as pillars connecting the 1D water&#8208;tapes and the halide anions. The water molecules are hydrogen&#8208;bonded with the halide anions and bestow a facile pathway for the proton conduction, with proton conductivity up to 3.19&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. In contrast, the ionic assembly formed by the lipophilic PF6&#8722; anions do not host the water tapes and consequently the proton conductivity is found to be four orders of magnitude lower. This is a unique example, whereby proton conductivity is realized and is tunable within a highly electron&#8208;deficient, eight&#8208;electron acceptor, water&#8208;stable ionic supramolecular system.

&lt;p&gt;Organic &#960;-scaffolds are being envisaged for new-age electron- and ion-responsive materials that can accumulate electrons as well as transport proton. However, such systems are extremely rare as electron-deficient scaffolds are unstable in aqueous solution. Here we detail the synthesis of a water-stable &lt;i&gt;core&lt;/i&gt;-naphthalenediimide&lt;i&gt;-&lt;/i&gt;nitrobenzyl-viologen based tetra-cation, which accumulates up to eight-electrons within an exceptionally narrow potential window of +0.05&#8197;V and &#8722;1.12&#8197;V. The supramolecular interactions and the ensuing ionic framework are tunable based on the three anions, e.&#8201;g., Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, that are investigated in this work. The ionic framework is formed and supported by a range of H-bonds, in which, the nitro benzyl groups act as pillars connecting the 1D water-tapes and the halide anions. The water molecules are hydrogen-bonded with the halide anions and bestow a facile pathway for the proton conduction, with proton conductivity up to 3.19&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. In contrast, the ionic assembly formed by the lipophilic PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions do not host the water tapes and consequently the proton conductivity is found to be four orders of magnitude lower. This is a unique example, whereby proton conductivity is realized and is tunable within a highly electron-deficient, eight-electron acceptor, water-stable ionic supramolecular system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Azines Bearing a Guanidine Core from N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC)&#8208;Derived Selenoureas and Diazo Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study introduces a novel transformation between N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;derived selenoureas and diazo compounds in the presence of triphenylphosphine. Products incorporating both an azine and a guanidine moiety are obtained, with potential applications in pharmaceuticals, materials chemistry, and organic synthesis.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;derived selenoureas comprise a fundamentally important class of NHC derivatives, with key applications in coordination chemistry and the determination of NHC electronic properties. Considering the broad reactivity of chalcogen&#8208;containing compounds, it is surprising to note that the use of NHC&#8208;derived selenoureas as organic synthons remains essentially unexplored. The present contribution introduces a novel, straightforward transformation leading to azines bearing a guanidine moiety, through the reaction of a wide range of NHC&#8208;derived selenoureas with commercially available diazo compounds, in the presence of triphenylphosphine. This transformation offers a new approach to such products, having biological, materials chemistry, and organic synthesis applications. The guanidine&#8208;bearing azines are obtained in excellent yields, with all manipulations taking place in air. A reaction mechanism is proposed, based on both experimental mechanistic findings and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. A one&#8208;pot, multicomponent transesterification reaction between selenoureas, &#945;&#8208;diazoesters, alcohols, and triphenylphosphine was also developed, providing highly functionalized azines.

         <title>Self&#8208;Replication Without Hydrogen&#8208;Bonds: An Exobiotic Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exobiotic self&#8208;replication: When sulfur is positioned between the two nitrogens of benzothiadiazole, it can engage in edge&#8208;on molecular recognition events. We present a new potential self&#8208;replicating system based on this interaction, and evidence for autocatalysis. The designs have implications for exobiology, due to their cosmic similarities and potential for genetic capacity.







Abstract
Life on Earth uses DNA as the central template for self&#8208;replication, genetic encoding, and information transfer. However, there are no physical laws precluding life's existence elsewhere in space, and alternative life forms may not need DNA. In the search for exobiology, knowing what to look for as a biosignature remains a challenge &#8211; especially if it is not from the obvious list of biologic building blocks. Clues from chemicals recently discovered on Mars and in the Taurus Molecular Cloud 1 (TMC&#8208;1), show that intriguing organic compounds exist beyond Earth, which could provide a starting point for unconventional exobiotic designs. Here we present a new potential self&#8208;replicating system with structural similarities to recently discovered compounds on Mars and TMC&#8208;1. Rather than using DNA's hydrogen&#8208;bonding motif for reliable base&#8208;paring, our design employs sulfur&#8208;nitrogen interactions to selectively template unique benzothiadiazole units in sequence. We synthesized and studied two versions of this system, one reversible and the other irreversible, and found experimental evidence of self&#8208;replication in d&#8208;chloroform solvent. These results are part of a larger pursuit in our lab for developing a basis for a potential exobiological system using starting blocks closely related to these cosmic compounds.

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization and Interconversion of p&#8211;Tolylsulfone&#8208;Functionalized Norbornadiene/Quadricyclane Couples</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of new push&#8211;pull functionalized norbornadiene/quadricyclane (NBD/QC) couples was generated and investigated. For the first time the para&#8208;tolylsulfone moiety was chosen as electron&#8208;withdrawing group. The library was comprehensively examined regarding their interconversion capability and photophysical properties.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of library of new 2,3&#8211;disubstituted norbornadiene/quadricyclane couples. For the first time, the para&#8211;tolylsulfone moiety was employed as electron&#8211;withdrawing substituent in combination with a variety of different electron donors as counterparts. Comprehensive characterization was conducted for every interconversion couple. By comparison with structurally related molecules published before we established the tosyl moiety as suitable alternative to previously investigated ester functionalities by providing similar photophysical properties. The photo&#8211;induced interconversion behavior was investigated via UV/Vis&#8208; and NMR&#8211;spectroscopy. The UV/Vis experiments were carried out exclusively in acetonitrile, whereas several solvents were investigated in the NMR studies. A detailed description and comparison of the isomerization behavior is provided, while examining relevant optical properties like &#955;max and &#955;onset. Thereby, an enhanced red&#8208;shift up to &#955;max=394&#8197;nm combined with an &#955;onset value of 469&#8197;nm could be generated which is necessary for potential applications.

         <title>Redox Transformations of the OX063 Radical in Biological Media: Oxidative Decay of Initial Trityl with Further Formation of Structurally&#8208;Modified TAM</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We studied in details redox reactions of OX063 radical in biological media. These reactions can introduce distortions into EPR oximetry data derived for objects under hypoxia, and they may possibly pose obstacles to the successful application of TAMs to spin&#8208;labeling of biopolymers for experiments in&#8197;vivo or in the cell. The use of 13C labeling to track these reactions is described.







Abstract
Being a low&#8208;toxic and hydrophilic representative of TAM, OX063 has shown its suitability for in&#8208;vivo and in&#8208;cell EPR experiments and design of spin labels. Using 13C labeling, we investigated the course of oxidative degradation of OX063 into quinone&#8208;methide (QM) under the influence of superoxide as well as further thiol&#8208;promoted reduction of QM into TAM radical, which formally corresponds to substitution of a carboxyl function by a hydroxyl group. We found these transformations being quantitative in model reactions mimicking specific features of biological media and confirmed the presence of these reactions in the blood and liver homogenate of mice in&#8197;vitro. The emergence of the trityl with the hydroxyl group can be masked by an initial TAM in EPR spectra and may introduce distortions into EPR&#8208;derived oximetry data if they have been obtained for objects under hypoxia. 13C labeling allows one to detect its presence, considering its different hyperfine splitting constant on 13C1 (2.04&#8197;mT) as compared to OX063 (2.30&#8197;mT). The potential involvement of these reactions should be considered when using TAM in spin&#8208;labeling of biopolymers intended for subsequent EPR experiments, as well as in the successful application of TAM in experiments in&#8197;vivo and in cell.

         <title>Quantitative Characterization of RCA&#8208;Based DNA Hydrogels &#8211; Towards Rational Materials Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of template sequences and reaction conditions on the synthesis of DNA hydrogels via Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA) was systematically investigated. The employed methodology is high&#8208;throughput capable and facilitates the development of sequence&#8208;property relationships by correlating reaction process parameters with synthesis efficiency and mechanical material properties.







Abstract
DNA hydrogels hold significant promise for biomedical applications and can be synthesized through enzymatic Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA). Due to the exploratory nature of this emerging field, standardized RCA protocols specifying the impact of reaction parameters are currently lacking. This study varied template sequences and reagent concentrations, evaluating RCA synthesis efficiency and hydrogel mechanical properties through quantitative PCR (qPCR) and indentation measurements, respectively. Primer concentration and stabilizing additives showed minimal impact on RCA efficiency, while changes in polymerase and nucleotide concentrations had a stronger effect. Concentration of the circular template exerted the greatest influence on RCA productivity. An exponential correlation between hydrogel viscosity and DNA amplicon concentration was observed, with nucleobase sequence significantly affecting both amplification efficiency and material properties, particularly through secondary structures. This study suggests that combining high&#8208;throughput experimental methods with structural folding prediction offers a viable approach for systematically establishing structure&#8208;property relationships, aiding the rational design of DNA hydrogel material systems.

         <title>Adsorption of Prochiral Solvent Molecules by Surface&#8208;Confined Chiral Supramolecular Assemblies: How Solvent Impacts on&#8208;Surface Chirality</title>

Adsorption of a prochiral solvent molecule in porous SAMNs formed by a chiral dehydrobenzo[12]annulene derivative leads to the reversal of supramolecular chirality of the SAMN through the prochirality recognition of a solvent molecule.







Abstract
The understanding of supramolecular chirality in self&#8208;assembled molecular networks (SAMNs) on surfaces generates a lot of interest because of its relation to the production of chiral sensors, reactors, and catalysts. We herein report the adsorption of a prochiral solvent molecule in porous SAMNs formed by a chiral dehydrobenzo[12]annulene (cDBA) derivative. Through the prochirality recognition of a solvent molecule, the supramolecular chirality of the SAMN is switched: the cDBA exclusively forms a counter&#8208;clockwise pore through co&#8208;adsorption of the solvent molecule in prochiral 1,2,4&#8208;trichlorobenzene, while in 1&#8208;phenyloctane it produces the opposite chiral, clockwise pore. The prochirality recognition of the solvent molecule in the chiral SAMN pores is attributed to the adaptable conformational changes of the chiral chains of the cDBA molecule.

         <title>Oxidative N&#8722;N Bond Formation Versus the Curtius Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present herein some experimental results, including NMR and x&#8208;ray, which have led to the recent retraction of a Nature Communications article claiming to feature a metal&#8208;free cross&#8208;dehydrogenative N&#8722;N coupling of primary amides with amines under the action of a hypervalent iodine oxidant. These findings should help the chemical research community to avoid such pitfalls in the future.







Abstract
The oxidative formation of N&#8722;N bonds from primary amides has been recently reported and then retracted in the journal Nature Communications by Kathiravan, Nicholls, and co&#8208;authors, utilizing a hypervalent iodane reagent. Unfortunately, the authors failed to recognize the Curtius reaction taking place under the described reaction conditions. Thus, the claimed N&#8722;N coupling products were not formed. Instead, the Curtius rearrangement urea coupling products were obtained. We demonstrate this herein by means of NMR and x&#8208;ray analysis, as well as with the support of an alternative synthetic route.

         <title>Tweezer Dyads for H&#8208;Bond Assisted Cooperativity in Tandem Uncaging Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tweezer dyads synthesized by click chemistry harness large two&#8208;photon absorption in the NIR region from quadrupolar antenna and enhancement of the uncaging efficiency via electron transfer sensitization leading to very high two&#8208;photon sensitivity.







Abstract
&#8220;Tandem&#8221; uncaging systems, in which a photolabile protecting group (PPG) is sensitized by an energy&#8208;harvesting antenna, may increase the photosensitivity of PPGs by several orders of magnitude for two&#8208;photon (2P) photorelease. Yet, they remain poorly accessible because of arduous multi&#8208;step synthesis. In this work, we design efficient tandem uncaging systems by (i) using a convenient assembly of the building blocks relying on click chemistry, (ii) introducing H&#8208;bonding induced proximity thus facilitating (iii) photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) as a cooperative mechanism. A strong two&#8208;photon absorber electron&#8208;donating quadrupolar antenna and various electron&#8208;accepting PPGs (mDEAC, MNI or MDNI) were clicked stepwise onto a &#8220;tweezer&#8208;shaped&#8221; pyrido&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxylate platform whose H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;stacking abilities were exploited to keep the antenna and the PPGs in close proximity. The different electron&#8208;accepting ability of the PPGs led to dyads with wildly different behaviors. Whilst the MDNI and MNI dyads showed poor dark stability or no photo&#8208;uncaging ability due to their too high electron&#8208;accepting character, the mDEAC dyad benefited from optimum redox potentials to promote PeT and slow down charge recombination, resulting in enhanced uncaging quantum yield (&#934;u=0.38) compared to mDEAC (&#934;u=0.014). This unique combination resulted in large 2P photo&#8208;sensitivity in the near&#8208;infrared window (240&#8197;GM at 710&#8197;nm).

         <title>Decarboxylative Alkylation of Carboxylic Acids with Easily Oxidizable Functional Groups Catalyzed by an Imidazole&#8208;Coordinated Fe3 Cluster under Visible Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Decarboxylative alkylation of carboxylic acids with easily oxidizable functional groups such as phenol and indole functionalities was achieved using a catalytic amount of basic iron(III) acetate, Fe(OAc)2(OH), in the presence of benzimidazole under 427 nm LED irradiation. Kinetic analyses of this catalytic reaction revealed that the reaction rate is first&#8208;order in alkenes and is linearly correlated with the light intensity; the faster reaction rate for the benzimidazole&#8208;ligated species was consistent with the increased absorbance in the visible light region. Wide functional group tolerance for the easily oxidizable groups is ascribed to the weak oxidation ability of the in situ&#8208;generated oxo&#8208;bridged iron clusters compared with other iron(III) species.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Gene Editing Technology for Tumor Microenvironment Modulation: An Emerging Anticancer Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer is a multifaceted disease influenced by both intrinsic cellular traits and extrinsic factors, with the tumor microenvironment (TME) being crucial in its progression. To satisfy their high proliferation and aggressiveness, cancer cell always plunders large amounts of nutrition and releases various signals to the surrounding, forming a dynamic TME with special metabolic, immune, microbial and physical characteristics. Due to the neglect of interactions between tumor cell and TME, traditional cancer therapies often struggle with challenges such as drug resistance, low efficacy, and recurrence. Importantly, with the development of gene editing technologies, particularly the CRISPR&#8208;Cas system, offers promising new strategies for cancer treatment. Combined with nanomaterials strategies, CRISPR&#8208;Cas technology exhibits precision, affordability, and user&#8208;friendliness with reduced side effects, which holds great promise for profoundly altering the TME at a genetic level, potentially leading to lasting anticancer outcomes. This review will delve into how CRISPR&#8208;Cas can be leveraged to manipulate the TME, examining its potential as a transformative anticancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation to Transportation: En&#8208;Route Fission&#8208;Facilitated Formation of Spheres in a Phosphorus&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymer for Transportation of Iodine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite its potential as a clean power source to meet rising electricity demands, nuclear energy generates radioactive waste, including isotopes of iodine, that pose significant environmental and health risks. There is a growing demand to capture radioactive iodine and repurpose it effectively. However, achieving this dual functionality with a single material remains a significant challenge. This study explores phosphorus&#8208;based porous organic polymers (P&#8208;POPs) as probes for these dual functionalities. By employing 4&#8208;formyl(triphenyl)phosphine (BB1) and phenyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diacetonitrile (BB2) under the Knoevenagel polycondensation method, P&#8208;POPs (PKPOPs) have been synthesized that exhibit a smooth spherical morphology, which efficiently captures and release iodine under ambient conditions, facilitating efficient transportation of molecular iodine. This novel approach aims to potentially transform nuclear waste into valuable organic feedstock via an iodination reaction. The innovative application of PKPOP has also been demonstrated for iodination reactions using ball mills and under continuous flow conditions, showcasing its potential for safer waste management and utilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigating the Mechanism of Triboluminescence: Insights from Structural and Electrostatic Characterization of Copper Thiocyanate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The creation of oppositely charged pairs, followed by their recombination to exhibit triboluminescence upon disrupting intermolecular interactions during mechanical fracture of crystal, was characterized by X&#8208;ray analysis and theoretical calculations. This study elucidated the crucial role of charge separation in triboluminescence and enabled its activation and deactivation through molecular network design.







Abstract
Triboluminescence is a phenomenon in which light is generated through mechanical stress; it has emerging applications in stress&#8208;sensing devices. Although the prevailing mechanistic model indicates that light emits from charge separation and recombination in fracture planes arising from polar structures, its application in designing triboluminescent materials remains limited owing to numerous exceptions. This study provides insights into the essential requirements for triboluminescence by investigating the structural and electrostatic properties of fractured crystals of copper thiocyanate complexes. The examined fracture plane indicated that charge pairs (which are essential for light emission) form when intermolecular interactions are disrupted during fracturing. On the basis of the nature of these charges, we successfully suppressed triboluminescence by inhibiting the formation of intermolecular interactions disrupted in the examined complexes. Furthermore, we induced its re&#8208;emergence by creating an alternative fracture plane through controlled manipulation of the molecular network. This demonstrative deactivation and reactivation of triboluminescence underscores the critical role of intermolecular disruption in generating charge pairs, a prerequisite for triboluminescence.

         <title>Origins of Temperature&#8208;Dependent Anomeric Selectivity in Glycosylations with an L&#8211;Idose Thioglycoside</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational modelling reveals the key mechanistic details explaining why glycosylations involving L&#8208;idose thioglycoside donors, and potentially also a wide range of other donors, become increasingly &#945;&#8208;selective as the temperature is raised.







Abstract
L&#8211;Idose thioglycosides are useful glycosyl donors for the construction of glycosaminoglycan oligosaccharides. When activated with NIS and catalytic TMSOTf in the presence of methanol, the stereoselectivity of O&#8208;glycosylation displays an intriguing dependence on the reaction temperature, with an increased preference for formation of the &#945;&#8208;glycoside at higher temperatures. Using a combination of vt&#8208;NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations, we show how a simple mechanistic model, based on competing reactions of the iodinated thioglycoside, can explain the main features of the temperature dependence. In this model, the increased selectivity at high temperature is attributed to differences among the entropy and energy terms of the competing reaction pathways. Neighbouring&#8208;group participation (giving an intermediate acyloxonium ion) plays an increasingly dominant role as temperature is raised. The general features of this kinetic regime may also apply more broadly to other glycosylations that likewise favour &#945;&#8208;glycoside formation at high temperature.

         <title>A Donor&#8208;Acceptor Molecular Octopus and the CLICK Procedure in Columnar Liquid Crystal Phases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular Octopus: A donor&#8208;acceptor discotic star mesogen based on a porphyrin core, bithiophene arms and decorated with four fullerenes attached via spacer forms porphyrin J&#8208;type aggregates by porphyrin&#8208;fullerene supramolecular interactions. Mixed with a complementary star providing intrinsic free space between the conjugated scaffold, the fullerenes fall into the void and assemble in completely different columnar aggregates.







Abstract
Two star&#8208;shaped mesogens with a (meso&#8208;tetraphenylporphinato) zinc (II) core and bithiophene conjugated arms with 3,4,5&#8208;trisdodecyloxyphenyl periphery were synthesized. One of these molecules was decorated with four fullerenes via an aliphatic spacer. This is the sterically overcrowded compound with an octapodal morphology. The other star lacks the fullerenes and provides free space between the conjugated arms. This mesogen does not aggregate in solution, but in solid state it forms a hexagonal columnar and a highly ordered oblique helical columnar phase, while the octopus molecule assembles in an amorphous solid. Photophysical studies of the octapodal compound in solution and the solid thin film reveal the formation of J&#8208;type aggregates, in which the interaction between donors (porphyrin) and acceptors (fullerene) dominates leading to absorption bands in the NIR region of the spectra. The mixture of both compounds results in a self&#8208;assembly which is called the Click procedure. Fullerenes of the octopus nanosegregate in the pockets of the star mesogens generating hexagonal columnar structures with a regular stacking along the columnar axis. Thus providing free space is a tool to control the competition between supramolecular interactions and nanosegregation. Such liquid&#8208;crystalline donor&#8208;acceptor structures may play a role in future LC photovoltaic applications.

         <title>A Phosphorus&#8208;Centred, Zirconocene&#8208;Bridged Tetraradical: Synthesis, Structure and Application as Molecular Double Switch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthesis of a phosphorus&#8208;centred tetraradical linked to a zirconocene fragment is presented, which can act as a molecular switch both in solution and in the solid state. This new hybrid switch was used to switch H2 addition on and off, which can be controlled photochemically.







Abstract
Biradicals are important intermediates in the formation and breaking of a chemical bond. Their use as molecular switches is of particular interest. Much less is known about tetraradicals, which can, for example, consist of two biradical(oid) units. Here we report the synthesis of the first persistent phosphorus&#8208;centred tetraradical bound to a transition metal fragment. Starting from a zirconocene complex, rac&#8208;(ebthi)ZrCl2 (rac&#8208;(ebthi)=1,2&#8208;ethylene&#8208;1,10&#8208;bis(&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydroindenyl), two cyclo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diphospha&#8208;pentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyls were successfully introduced, which finally led to the isolation of a deep green zirconcene&#8208;bridged bis(biradicaloid) complex (5) that can act as a double molecular switch. Under the influence of light (570&#8197;nm), this tetraradical forms a transannular bond in each of the two five&#8208;membered biradical units, leading to the formation of housane 5&#8201;h. Upon irradiation at 415&#8197;nm, the reverse reaction is observed, fully recovering tetraradical 5. Through single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation, both stable species of the molecular switch could be structurally characterised using SCXRD.

     alt="A Phosphorus-Centred, Zirconocene-Bridged Tetraradical: Synthesis, Structure and Application as Molecular Double Switch"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The first synthesis of a phosphorus-centred tetraradical linked to a zirconocene fragment is presented, which can act as a molecular switch both in solution and in the solid state. This new hybrid switch was used to switch H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; addition on and off, which can be controlled photochemically&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biradicals are important intermediates in the formation and breaking of a chemical bond. Their use as molecular switches is of particular interest. Much less is known about tetraradicals, which can, for example, consist of two biradical(oid) units. Here we report the synthesis of the first persistent phosphorus-centred tetraradical bound to a transition metal fragment. Starting from a zirconocene complex, &lt;i&gt;rac&lt;/i&gt;-(ebthi)ZrCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;rac&lt;/i&gt;-(ebthi)=1,2-ethylene-1,10-bis(&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-tetrahydroindenyl), two cyclo-1,3-diphospha-pentane-1,3-diyls were successfully introduced, which finally led to the isolation of a deep green zirconcene-bridged bis(biradicaloid) complex (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;) that can act as a double molecular switch. Under the influence of light (570&#8197;nm), this tetraradical forms a transannular bond in each of the two five-membered biradical units, leading to the formation of housane &lt;b&gt;5&#8201;h&lt;/b&gt;. Upon irradiation at 415&#8197;nm, the reverse reaction is observed, fully recovering tetraradical &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;. Through single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation, both stable species of the molecular switch could be structurally characterised using SCXRD. The switching under the influence of light and the activation of molecular hydrogen were analysed in solution using NMR and UV spectroscopy. It was found that the addition of one or two equivalents of molecular hydrogen can be switched on and off by light.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Benzothiadiazole&#8208;Based Ordered Mesoporous Polymer as a Versatile, Metal&#8208;Free Heterogeneous Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benzothiadiazole&#8208;functionalized ordered mesoporous polymer (OMP) is synthesized by an evaporation induced self&#8208;assembly (EISA) approach, which is used as a versatile heterogeneous photocatalyst for a wide variety of organic transformations (six reactions). This work suggests a new avenue to develop photoactive OMPs as next generation of heterogeneous photocatalysts.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light active heterogeneous organophotocatalysts have recently gained considerable interest in organic synthetic community. Ordered mesoporous polymers (OMPs) are highly promising as heterogeneous alternative to traditional precious metal/organic dyes&#8208;based photocatalysts. Herein, we report the preparation of a benzothiadiazole functionalized OMPs (BT&#8208;MPs) through a &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; strategy. High ordered periodic porosity, large surface area, excellent stability and rational energy&#8208;band structures guarantee the high catalytic activity of BT&#8208;MPs. As a result, at least six conversions, e.&#8201;g., the [3+2] cycloaddition of phenols with olefins, the selective oxidation of sulfides, the C&#8208;3 thiocyanation of indole and the aminothiocyanation of &#946;&#8208;keto ester, could be promoted smoothly by BT&#8208;MPs. In addition, BT&#8208;MPs was readily recovered with well maintaining its photocatalytic activity and could be reused for at least eight times. This study highlights the potential of exploiting photoactive OMPs as recyclable, robust and metal&#8208;free heterogeneous photocatalysts.

A well&#8208;defined soluble magnesium complex of the C706&#8722; ion has been prepared and characterised, and the various global and local changes to structure, charges and orbitals as a result of reduction and countercation coordination are discussed.







Abstract
Controlling and understanding charge state and metal coordination in carbon nanomaterials is crucial to harnessing their unique properties. Here we describe the synthesis of the well&#8208;defined fulleride complex [{(Mesnacnac)Mg}6C70], 2, (Mesnacnac)=HC(MeCNMes)2, Mes=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2, from the reaction of the &#946;&#8208;diketiminate magnesium(I) complex [{(Mesnacnac)Mg}2] with C70 in aromatic solvents. The molecular structure of complex 2 was determined, providing the first high&#8208;quality structural study of a complex with the C706&#8722; ion. In combination with solution state NMR spectroscopic and DFT computational studies, the changes in geometry and charge distribution in the various atom and bond types of the fulleride unit were investigated. Additionally, the influence of the (Mesnacnac)Mg+ cations on the global and local fulleride coordination environment was examined.

         <title>Tuning the Thermal Stability of Tetra&#8208;o&#8211;chloroazobenzene Derivatives by Transforming Push&#8208;Pull to Push&#8208;Push Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From push&#8208;pull to push&#8208;push tetra&#8208;o&#8208;chloroazobenzenes: Six new tetra&#8208;o&#8208;chloroazobenzenes bearing push&#8208;pull systems displaying very short half&#8208;life for the Z&#8208;isomers (t1/2&lt;10&#8197;ms) have been successfully synthesized via the azo&#8208;coupling method. Through one&#8208;step reduction of the nitro group, the push&#8208;pull tetra&#8208;o&#8208;chloroazobenzenes can be readily transformed into the push&#8208;push derivatives, with dramatically increased thermostability for the corresponding Z&#8208;isomers (t1/2&gt;4&#8197;h). Furthermore, these functionalisable azobenzenes demonstrate excellent photostability under full&#8208;visible light irradiation.







Abstract
Molecular photoswitches provide interesting tools to reversibly control various biological functions with light. Thanks to its small size and easy introduction into the biomolecules, azobenzene derivatives have been widely employed in the field of photopharmacology. All visible&#8208;light switchable azobenzenes with controllable thermostability are highly demanded. Based on the reported tetra&#8208;o&#8208;chloroazobenzenes, we synthesized push&#8208;pull systems, by introducing dialkyl amine and nitro groups as strong electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the para&#8208;positions, and then transformed to push&#8208;push systems by a simple reduction step. The developed push&#8208;pull and push&#8208;push tetra&#8208;o&#8208;chloroazobenzene derivatives displayed excellent photoswitching properties, as previously reported. The half&#8208;life of the Z&#8208;isomers can be tuned from milliseconds for the push&#8208;pull system to several hours for the push&#8208;push system. The n&#8208;&#960;* and &#960;&#8208;&#960;* transitions have better resolution in the push&#8208;push molecules, and excitation at different wavelengths can tune the E/Z ratio at the photostationary state. For one push&#8208;pull molecule, structure and absorption spectra obtained from theoretical calculations are compared with experimental data, along with data on the push&#8208;push counterpart.

         <title>Luminescent Platinum(II) Complexes with Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Flexible Lewis Pair Ligands: Spectroscopic and Computational Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of platinum(II) complexes containing stimuli&#8208;responsive Flexible Lewis Pair (FlexLP) ligands were synthesized and characterized. The photophysical properties of the complexes have been studied using spectroscopic techniques and theoretical calculations. The results show that these complexes exhibit readily tunable fluorescence and triplet excited&#8208;state lifetime that can be controlled by the solvent and peripheral ligands on the platinum(II) centers.







Abstract
A series of new luminescent bimetallic platinum(II) complexes with stimuli&#8208;responsive flexible Lewis pair (FlexLP) ligands are described. The FlexLP ligands consist of a dimesitylboron Lewis acid and diphenylphosphine oxide Lewis base which are in equilibrium between the unbound open form and the Lewis adduct, controlled by the hydrogen bond donating strength of the solvent. Spectroscopic techniques and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to interpret the photophysics of the platinum(II) complexes. All complexes exhibit tunable absorption in the region of 300&#8211;500&#8197;nm and green to orange photoluminescence, depending on the ratio of weak (THF) to strong (MeOH) hydrogen bond donating solvent employed. Spectroscopic and computational data shows that phosphine and peripheral acetylide ligands on the platinum(II) centers have limited influence on the emission energy, indicating the emission originates from the FlexLP&#8208;dominated fluorescence. Using time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy it is shown that the complexes undergo intersystem crossing (ISC) to the triplet excited state upon photoexcitation, and the ISC efficiency is affected by the peripheral acetylide ligands. The triplet excited state lifetime can also be manipulated by the state of the FlexLP ligand, with the closed form complexes having longer lifetimes than the open form complexes.

The triplet excited state lifetime can also be manipulated by the state of the FlexLP ligand, with the closed form complexes having longer lifetimes than the open form complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tetrazole and Oxadiazole Derivatives as Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article explores the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties of six specially designed emitters for OLEDs, focusing on how structural variations like donor&#8208;acceptor distances and functional groups influence TADF efficiency. One standout emitter, TCz&#8208;CN, shows excellent performance as a blue&#8208;green emitter, demonstrating the potential for optimizing OLED properties through precise molecular design.







Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are promising lighting solutions for sustainability and energy efficiency. Incorporating thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules enables OLEDs to achieve internal quantum efficiency (IQE), in principle, up to 100&#8201;%; therefore, new classes of promising TADF emitters and modifications of existing ones are sought after. This study explores the TADF emission properties of six designed TADF emitters, examining their photophysical responses using experimental and theoretical methods. The design strategy involves creating six distinct types of a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) system, where tert&#8208;butylcarbazoles are used as donors, while the acceptor component incorporates three different functional groups: nitrile, tetrazole and oxadiazole, with varying electron&#8208;withdrawing character. Additionally, the donor&#8208;acceptor distance is adjusted using a phenylene spacer, and its influence on TADF functionality is examined. The clear dependency of an additional spacer, inhibiting TADF, could be revealed. Emitters with a direct donor&#8208;acceptor connection are demonstrated to exhibit TADF moderate emissive behavior. The analysis emphasizes the impact of charge transfer, singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps (&#916;EST), and other microscopic parameters on photophysical rates, permitting TADF. Among the emitters, TCz&#8208;CN shows optimal performance as a blue&#8208;green emitter with an 88&#8201;% photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and fast rate of reversible intersystem crossing of 2&#215;106&#8197;s&#8722;1 and 1&#215;107&#8197;s&#8722;1, obtained from time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) experiment in PMMA matrix and quantum mechanical calculations, respectively. This comprehensive exploration identifies molecular bases of superior TADF emitters and provides insights for future designs, advancing the optimization of TADF properties in OLEDs.

         <title>De&#8208; and Rearomatisation of Pyridine in Silylene Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dearomatisation process of pyridine is facilitated by the metal&#8208;free reactions of pyridylamino&#8208;functionalized silylene with benzophenone or acetophenone. The former resulting product can undergo further rearomatisation of pyridine upon heating. Both steric hindrance and aromatic groups collectively influence the dearomatisation of pyridine in pyridylaminosilylene reactions.







Abstract
Traditional methods relying on metal&#8208;ligand cooperation for activating pyridine bonds in de&#8208; and rearomatisation are being challenged by the abundant metal&#8208;free element species as alternatives. Here, we investigated the de/re&#8208;aromatisation of pyridine facilitated by pyridylamino&#8208;functionalised silylene reactions with ketones and ketene. The reactivity outcome is highly dependent on the substituents on the ketones. By carefully tuning the steric demand of the ketone, each intermediate of the reaction sequence could be isolated. At room temperature, benzophenone and acetophenone substrates led to dearomatisation of the pyridine moiety, with the case of acetophenone showing an intermediate silaoxirane preceding dearomatisation. However, when subjected to acetone or diphenylketene, only silaoxiranes were formed without dearomatisation of the pyridine moiety. Notably, only benzophenone&#8208;derived dearomatised species demonstrated rearomatisation upon heating. Furthermore, the reduced steric bulk of the ketene facilitated further ring expansion with another equivalent of the substrate, forming sila&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolanes. Both steric hindrance and aromatic groups collectively influence the dearomatisation of pyridine in pyridylaminosilylene reactions.

         <title>Functional Linkers Support Targeting of Multivalent Tweezers to Taspase1</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Dock &amp; lock&#8221;: Supramolecular binding units mediate specific docking of the linker to lock the ligands&#8217; jaws on the protein of interest (POI). Molecular tweezers (MT) were equipped with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) functionalities to generate spider&#8208;like inhibitors lighting up upon Taspase1 binding. Utilizing a calix[4]arene backbone resulted in a scorpion&#8208;like double pincer ligand with even superior binding and inhibition properties.







Abstract
Taspase 1 is a unique protease not only pivotal for embryonic development but also implicated in leukemias and solid tumors. As such, this enzyme is a promising while still challenging therapeutic target, and with its protein structure featuring a flexible loop preceding the active site a versatile model system for drug development. Supramolecular ligands provide a promising complementary approach to traditional small&#8208;molecule inhibitors. Recently, the multivalent arrangement of molecular tweezers allowed the successful targeting of Taspase 1&#8217;s surface loop. With this study we now want to take the next logic step und utilize functional linker systems that not only allow the implementation of novel properties but also engage in protein surface binding. Consequently, we chose two different linker types differing from the original divalent assembly: a backbone with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties to enable monitoring of binding and a calix[4]arene scaffold initially pre&#8208;positioning the supramolecular binding units. With a series of four AIE&#8208;equipped ligands with stepwise increased valency we demonstrated that the functionalized AIE linkers approach ligand binding affinities in the nanomolar range and allow efficient proteolytic inhibition of Taspase 1. Moreover, implementation of the calix[4]arene backbone further enhanced the ligands&#8217; inhibitory potential, pointing to a specific linker contribution.

Designed high&#8208;voltage electrolytes with stabilities of up to 7 Volt by incorporation of fluoroether linkers into pyrrolidinium&#8208;based dicationic ionic liquids.







Abstract
Novel fluorinated, pyrrolidinium&#8208;based dicationic ionic liquids (FDILs) as high&#8208;performance electrolytes in energy storage devices have been prepared, displaying unprecedented electrochemical stabilities (up to 7&#8197;V); thermal stability (up to 370&#8201;&#176;C) and ion transport (up to 1.45&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1). FDILs were designed with a fluorinated ether linker and paired with TFSI/FSI counterions. To comprehensively assess the impact of the fluorinated spacer on their electrochemical, thermal, and physico&#8208;chemical properties, a comparison with their non&#8208;fluorinated counterparts was conducted. With a specific focus on their application as electrolytes in next&#8208;generation high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries, the impact of the Li&#8208;salt on the characteristics of dicationic ILs was systematically evaluated. The incorporation of a fluorinated linker demonstrates significantly superior properties compared to their non&#8208;fluorinated counterparts, presenting a promising alternative towards next&#8208;generation high&#8208;voltage energy storage systems.

         <title>Unveiling the Influence of Brightness Heterogeneity in Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy of Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through advanced PIE&#8208;FCS and blinking studies, we investigated the FCS behaviors of nanoparticles with single&#8208;photon purity. Our findings reveal that several FCS characteristics, such as reduced g2(0) amplitude and extended diffusion time at high pump intensity, stem from brightness heterogeneity, which is, light&#8208;induced ON/OFF blinking of individual nanoparticles.







Abstract
Nanoparticles (NPs), including perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) with single photon purity, present challenges in fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) studies due to their distinct photoluminescence (PL) behaviors. In particular, the zero&#8208;time correlation amplitude [g2(0)] and the associated diffusion timescale (&#964;D) of their FCS curves show substantial dependency on pump intensity (IP). Optical saturation inadequately explains the origin of this FCS phenomenon in NPs, thus setting them apart from conventional dye molecules, which do not manifest such behavior. This observation is apparently attributed to either photo&#8208;brightening or optical trapping, both lead to increased NP occupancy (N) in the excitation volume, consequently reducing the g2(0) amplitude [since g2(0) &#945; 1/N] at high IP. However, an advanced FCS study utilizing alternating laser excitation at two different intensities dismisses such possibilities. Further investigation into single&#8208;particle blinking behaviors as a function of IP reveals that the intensity dependence of g2(0) primarily arises from the brightness heterogeneity prevalent in almost all types of NPs. This report delves into the complexities of the photophysical properties of NPs and their adverse impacts on FCS studies.

     alt="Unveiling the Influence of Brightness Heterogeneity in Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy of Perovskite Nanocrystals"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through advanced PIE-FCS and blinking studies, we investigated the FCS behaviors of nanoparticles with single-photon purity. Our findings reveal that several FCS characteristics, such as reduced g&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(0) amplitude and extended diffusion time at high pump intensity, stem from brightness heterogeneity, which is, light-induced ON/OFF blinking of individual nanoparticles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanoparticles (NPs), including perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) with single photon purity, present challenges in fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) studies due to their distinct photoluminescence (PL) behaviors. In particular, the zero-time correlation amplitude [g&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(0)] and the associated diffusion timescale (&#964;&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;) of their FCS curves show substantial dependency on pump intensity (I&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;). Optical saturation inadequately explains the origin of this FCS phenomenon in NPs, thus setting them apart from conventional dye molecules, which do not manifest such behavior. This observation is apparently attributed to either photo-brightening or optical trapping, both lead to increased NP occupancy (N) in the excitation volume, consequently reducing the g&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(0) amplitude [since g&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(0) &#945; 1/N] at high I&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;. However, an advanced FCS study utilizing alternating laser excitation at two different intensities dismisses such possibilities. Further investigation into single-particle blinking behaviors as a function of I&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; reveals that the intensity dependence of g&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(0) primarily arises from the brightness heterogeneity prevalent in almost all types of NPs.

         <title>Well&#8208;Defined Highly&#8208;Coordinated Copper(III) Iodide and Pincer Tris(trifluoromethyl)copper Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique high&#8208;valent formal Cu(III) iodide complex was prepared from tris(trifluoromethyl)copper pyridine adduct by weak Lewis base addition and fully characterized including X&#8208;ray crystallography. Pyridine adduct undergoes ligand substitution with tridentate pincer ligands to give formally octahedral Cu(III)(CF3)3 species, with high potential for applications.

         <title>Biocatalysis in Non&#8208;Conventional Media: Unlocking the Potential for Sustainable Chiral Amine Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Replacing traditional aqueous reaction media with non&#8208;conventional solvents shows great potential for enhancing the sustainability of enzyme catalysis and addressing issues in large&#8208;scale production applications. This review highlights significant advancements in using non&#8208;conventional media, such as organic green solvents and Deep Eutectic Solvents, to produce chiral amines with high yields and enantiomeric excesses, as well as to enable chemo&#8208;enzymatic cascades.







Abstract
The application of biocatalysis has become essential in both academic and industrial domains for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amines, and it serves as an alternative tool to transition&#8208;metal catalysis and complements traditional chemical methods. It relies on the swift expansion of available processes, primarily as a result of advanced tools for enzyme discovery, combined with high&#8208;throughput laboratory evolution techniques for optimizing biocatalysts. This concept paper explores the utilization of non&#8208;conventional media such as ether&#8208;type solvents, deep eutectic solvents, and micellar catalysis to enhance biocatalytic reactions for chiral amine synthesis. Each section focuses on the unique properties of these media, including their ability to stabilize enzymes, alter substrate solubility, and modulate enzyme selectivity. The paper aims to provide insights into how these innovative media can overcome traditional limitations, offering new avenues for sustainable and efficient chiral amine production through biocatalytic processes.

         <title>Efficient Adsorption and Elimination of Tm3+ for Enhanced Seed Germination Using Pillar[5]Arene Polymer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes the design and synthesis of a pillar[5] arene&#8208;based polymer (Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP) for enhancing the adsorption and recovery of rare earth elements (REE). Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP exhibits excellent adsorption capacity, thermal stability, and porous structure. It shows versatility in absorbing and recovering various RREs, with the potential for reuse in green agriculture.







Abstract
While rare earth elements (REEs) are essential for modern technology, their production methods raise concerns for agriculture. Researchers are now exploring ways to control and recycle REEs pollution, aiming to minimize agricultural impacts and potentially even develop methods to utilize these elements for improved crop yields. Regarding this issue, a new type of pillar[5]arene polymer (Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP) has been designed and synthesized by click reaction to enhance the efficiency of adsorption and recovery of rare earth metals. This polymer incorporates the unique structure of 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;pyridine. The results of various analyses revealed that Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP exhibits excellent thermal stability, a high specific surface area, and well&#8208;distributed networks of micropores and mesoporous structures. The adsorption capacity of Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP for Tm3+, a representative REE, was evaluated using the Langmuir and Freundlich isothermal adsorption models with a maximum adsorption capacity (Qmax) of 127.71&#8197;mg/g. Furthermore, the versatility of Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP in adsorption and recovering various REEs was tested. In addition to its adsorption capabilities, the potential of Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP for rare earth recovery and reuse was assessed through experiments on the impact of Tm3+ and La3+ on seed germination. These experiments demonstrated the wide&#8208;ranging applicability of Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP in recovering and reusing REEs for green agriculture.

         <title>DNA Hierarchical Superstructures from Micellar Units: Stiff Hydrogels and Anisotropic Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using three different orthogonal interactions &#8211; hydrophobic effect, RNA kissing loops, DNA base pairing &#8211; we created hierarchical nanostructures from precise DNA amphiphiles. These micron&#8208;sized materials are controlled by the nanoscale structure of the self&#8208;assembled amphiphiles with sequence&#8208;dependent behavior and have found applications as self&#8208;healing hydrogels. This bottom&#8208;up approach opens new avenues towards novel DNA hybrid materials.







Abstract
Supramolecular materials have been assembled using a wide range of interactions, including the hydrophobic effect, DNA base&#8208;pairing, and hydrogen bonding. Specifically, DNA amphiphiles with a hydrophobic building block self&#8208;assemble into diverse morphologies depending on the length and composition of both blocks. Herein, we take advantage of the orthogonality of different supramolecular interactions &#8211; the hydrophobic effect, Watson&#8208;Crick&#8208;Franklin base pairing and RNA kissing loops &#8211; to create hierarchical self&#8208;assemblies with controlled morphologies on both the nanometer and the micrometer scales. Assembly through base&#8208;pairing leads to the formation of hybrid, multi&#8208;phasic hydrogels with high stiffness and self&#8208;healing properties. Assembly via hydrophobic core interactions gives anisotropic, discrete assemblies, where DNA fibers with one sequence are terminated with DNA spheres bearing different sequences. This work opens new avenues for the bottom&#8208;up construction of DNA&#8208;based materials, with promising applications in drug delivery, tissue engineering, and the creation of complex DNA structures from a minimum array of components.

         <title>Dynamic Phase Behavior of Surface&#8208;Active Fluorinated Ionic Liquid Epoxidation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the synthesis of amphiphobic fluorinated surface&#8208;active ionic liquid (FSAIL) epoxidation catalysts, which show reversible temperature&#8208;controlled solubility in water. The solubility of FSAILs containing the catalytically active perrhenate&#8208; and tungstate anions was studied in both the aqueous and the substrate phase, showing a significant solubility decrease in both media compared to their non&#8208;fluorinated congeners. It was shown that both the epoxide product and the catalyst additive phenylphosphonic acid (PPA) are efficient in transferring the FSAIL catalyst into the organic phase, rendering the reaction homogeneous. The FSAILs were used as catalysts for the epoxidation of olefins using aqueous H2O2 as oxidant, showing an exceptionally high catalytic activity at mild conditions. Catalyst recycling was demonstrated over ten consecutive runs by phase separation and subsequent product distillation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Strongly Ambiphilic Ferrocene&#8208;Based Cyclic (Alkyl)(amino)carbene &#8211; Specific Decomposition to an Enamine by a 1,2&#8208;Phenyl Shift</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recently described crystalline cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene with a 1,1&#8217;&#8208;ferrocenylene (fc) backbone fc(CPh2&#8211;C&#8211;NMes) (A, Mes = mesityl) is highly reactive due to its particularly pronounced ambiphilicity and is thermally not stable in solution due to an intramolecular insertion of the divalent carbon atom into a methyl C&#8211;H bond of the Mes substituent. The closely related congener fc(CPh2&#8211;C&#8211;N&#8208;p&#8208;C6H4&#8208;tBu) (1) cannot undergo such an insertion reaction. Nevertheless, 1 is too short&#8208;lived for isolation due to a rapid 1,2&#8208;shift of a phenyl group, furnishing the isomeric cyclic enamine fc[C(Ph)=C(Ph)&#8211;N&#8208;p&#8208;C6H4&#8208;tBu] (1&#8217;) in a specific decomposition process unprecedented for CAACs. Trapping of 1 was possible with carbon monoxide, elemental selenium and with [CuBr(SMe2)], respectively affording the aminoketene 1=C=O, the selenoamide 1=Se and the homoleptic CuI complex [Cu(1)2][CuBr2]. 1 is an even stronger ambiphile than A according to NMR spectroscopic data. Similar to A, 1 does not react with H2, because the experimentally observed intramolecular process is kinetically more favourable according to DFT results.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulating the Substituent Sphere of a Bicyclic Silicon(I) Ring Compound Results in Anionic Cubane&#8208;Type Clusters and a Tetrahedral Silanide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of the bicyclic silicon(I) ring compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4 1 with strong zwitterionic character and moderate sterical demand of the amido substituents with two equivalents of KC8 was investigated. This resulted in the unexpected abstraction of two amido substituents from 1 and additionally in dimerization to a dianionic Si8 cluster compound 2 with four unsubstituted silicon atoms and two [K([18]crown&#8208;6)]+ counter cations. Performing this reaction in the absence of [18]crown&#8208;6 results in release of only one amido substituent from 1 and dimerization to a dianionic Si8 cluster compound 3 with only two unsubstituted silicon atoms. This reaction with KC8 was repeated and trapping agents such as SiMe3Cl and tBuCl were added in&#8208;situ whereupon the second isolated homocyclic silylene 4 and a monoanionic hydride and tBu substituted Si8 cluster 5 with one unsubstituted silicon atom were isolated. Furthermore, 1 was reacted with KOtBu which resulted in the selective abstraction of one SiMe3 group and formation of the tetrahedral silanide 6 with one imido substituent bridging an edge of the tetrahedron.</dc:description>

         <title>Secondary Sphere Lewis Acid Activated Heme Superoxo Adducts Mimic Crucial Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in IDO/TDO Heme Dioxygenases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heme enzymes play a central role in a medley of reactivities within a wide variety of crucial biological systems. Their active sites are highly decorated with pivotal evolutionarily optimized non&#8208;covalent interactions that precisely choreograph their biological functionalities with specific regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and chemo&#8208;selectivities. Gaining a clear comprehension of how such weak interactions within the active sites control reactivity offers powerful information to be implemented into the design of future therapeutic agents that target these heme enzymes. To shed light on such critical details pertaining to tryptophan dioxygenating heme enzymes, this study investigates the indole dioxygenation reactivities of Lewis acid&#8208;activated heme superoxo model systems, wherein an unprecedented kinetic behavior is revealed. In that, the activated heme superoxo adduct is observed to undergo indole dioxygenation with the intermediacy of a non&#8208;covalently organized precursor complex, which forms prior to the rate&#8208;limiting step of the overall reaction landscape. Spectroscopic and theoretical characterization of this precursor complex draws close parallels to the ternary complex of heme dioxygenases, which has been postulated to be of crucial importance for successful 2,3&#8208;dioxygenative cleavage of indole moieties.</dc:description>

         <title>Adjusting the Number of Functional Groups in Vicinal Bis(trichlorosilylated) Benzenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organo(chloro)silanes are essential chemicals, but the synthesis of compounds of the formula RnSiCl4&#8210;n with defined values of n is usually laborious. Herein, we first disclose that a [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition between readily available Cl3SiC&#8801;CSiCl3 and selected dienes provides facile access to vicinal bis(trichlorosilylated) benzenes and bicyclo[2.2.2]octa&#8208;2,5&#8208;dienes. Second, we show how the number of six Si&#8210;Cl bonds in 1,2&#8208;(Cl3Si)2C6H2Me2 (1) can be selectively reduced to four or two by reaction with pinacol (H2pin) or catechol (H2cat), which act as Si&#183;&#183;&#183;Si&#8217;&#8208;bridging and/or Si&#8208;chelating ligands. Third, we demonstrate that the thermolysis of compound 6, which contains a benzannulated eight&#8208;membered C2(SiCl2)2(&#956;&#8208;pin) ring with Si&#183;&#183;&#183;Si&#8217;&#8208;bridging pin moiety, furnishes 13 with a benzannulated five&#8208;membered C2(SiCl2)2O ring via the release of pinacolone. Such cyclic disiloxanes are valuable building blocks for specialty silicones; an alternative assembly of the Si&#8210;O&#8210;Si unit by controlled hydrolysis of 1 is not feasible if the four valuable Si&#8210;Cl functionalities are to be retained for further derivatization. Substitution of one Cl atom per Si site of 13 gives the rac&#8208;1,3&#8208;disila&#8208;2&#8208;oxaindane rac&#8208;15 with high selectivity.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>6,13&#8208;Diethynylpentacene derivatives with sterically bulky substituents (Tr*, tris(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl)methyl groups) appended to the ethynyl moieties at the 6&#8208; and 13&#8208;positions have been synthesized, as well as derivatives with electron withdrawing fluorine groups on the eight pro&#8208;cata positions. These molecules are designed to investigate relationships between steric and electronic effects on the stability of pentacene toward endoperoxide formation via reaction with photosensitized oxygen in solution under conditions of ambient light (i.e., &#8216;laboratory&#8217; conditions). It is evident from the study that stabilization through changes to the electronic characteristics of pentacene are more effective than the incorporation of sterically bulky groups at the acetylenic termini. Selected pentacene derivatives have been made into binary, amorphous films with the fullerene derivative PCBM to investigate the stability imparted by substituents against cycloaddition reactions. Overall, the introduction of steric protection through incorporation of Tr* groups is not an efficient strategy for enhancing persistence of pentacenes. Stabilization through fluorination proves successful for extending the lifetime of the pentacene derivatives by an order of magnitude in solution. Notably, the persistence of pentacene derivatives in solution can also be enhanced through the use ethereal solvents stabilized with butylated hydroxy toluene (BHT) and/or an increased number of trialkylsilyl groups as substituents.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of an Electrochemical Cell for Continuous Wave EPR Measurements of Radical Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (cw&#8208;EPR) with electrochemistry is highly attractive as it allows a clean in&#8208;situ generation and the subsequent spectroscopic characterisation of radical ions, which are important intermediates in many photocatalytic cycles as well as light&#8208;induced processes occurring in biological systems or optoelectronic devices. Although commercial setups for spectroelectrochemical EPR are available, they are often expensive and tailored to a particular spectroscopic setup.&#160;

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The combination of continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (cw-EPR) with electrochemistry is highly attractive as it allows a clean in-situ generation and the subsequent spectroscopic characterisation of radical ions, which are important intermediates in many photocatalytic cycles as well as light-induced processes occurring in biological systems or optoelectronic devices. Although commercial setups for spectroelectrochemical EPR are available, they are often expensive and tailored to a particular spectroscopic setup.&#160;

         <title>Investigation of Neighboring Group Participation in 3,4&#8208;Diacetylated Glycosyl Donors in the Gas Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A key challenge in oligosaccharide synthesis is the stereoselective installation of glycosidic bonds. Each glycosidic linkage has one of two possible stereo&#8208;chemical geometries, &#945;/&#946; or 1,2&#8208;cis/trans. An established approach to install 1,2&#8208;trans glycosidic bonds is neighboring group participation (NGP), mediated by a 2&#8208;O&#8208;acyl group. Extension of this intramolecular stabilization to nucleophilic groups located at more remote positions has also been suggested, but remains poorly understood. Previously, we employed infrared ion spectroscopy to characterize the molecular ions of monoacetylated sugar donors and showed how the strength of the stabilizing effect depends on the position of the participating ester group on the glycosyl donor ring as well as on its relative stereochemistry. In this work, we investigated glycosyl donors carrying two acyl groups. Using isotope labelling and isomer population analysis we were able to resolving spectra of isomeric mixtures and establish the relative contribution of individual species. We conclude that 3,4&#8208;diacetyl mannosyl donors exclusively form a dioxanium ion as a result of C&#8208;3 acyl stabilization. In contrast, the glucosyl and galactosyl cations form mixtures of C&#8208;3 and C&#8208;4 acyl participation products. Hence, the combination of isotope labeling and population analysis allows for the study of increasingly complex glycosyl cations.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving Molecular&#8208;Dynamics Simulations for Solid&#8211;Liquid Interfaces with Machine&#8208;Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 49, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have summarized the evolution of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), introduced some interesting examples applied at solid&#8208;liquid interfaces, and finally posed some prospects for the current challenge of MLIPs.







Abstract
Emerging developments in artificial intelligence have opened infinite possibilities for material simulation. Depending on the powerful fitting of machine learning algorithms to first&#8208;principles data, machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) can effectively balance the accuracy and efficiency problems in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, serving as powerful tools in various complex physicochemical systems. Consequently, this brings unprecedented enthusiasm for researchers to apply such novel technology in multiple fields to revisit the major scientific problems that have remained controversial owing to the limitations of previous computational methods. Herein, we introduce the evolution of MLIPs, provide valuable application examples for solid&#8211;liquid interfaces, and present current challenges. Driven by solving multitudinous difficulties in terms of the accuracy, efficiency, and versatility of MLIPs, this booming technique, combined with molecular simulation methods, will provide an underlying and valuable understanding of interdisciplinary scientific challenges, including materials, physics, and chemistry.

         <title>Synthesis and Application of Robust Spiro [Fluorene&#8208;9] CAAC Ruthenium Alkylidene Complexes for the &#8220;One&#8208;Pot&#8221; Conversion of Allyl Acetate to Butane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 49, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of spiro [fluorene&#8208;9] CAAC Ru complexes was prepared. The dynamic properties and activities of molecular catalysts were tuned with smart design and tailoring. In addition to their high metathesis activity, these new compounds also proved to be excellent hydrogenation catalysts, which allowed the one&#8208;pot production of 1,4&#8208;butanediol, a key compound in the synthesis of biodegradable polymers.







Abstract
A series of a novel CAAC ligands featuring a spiro&#8208;fluorene group have been synthesized and complexed with ruthenium alkylidenes, yielding the corresponding Hoveyda&#8208;type derivatives as a new family of olefin metathesis catalysts. The novel complexes have been characterized by XRD, HRMS and NMR measurements. The synthetised complexes were tested in catalysis and showed good activity in olefin metathesis, as demonstrated on diethyl diallylmalonate and allyl acetate substrates. The unique backbone in the ligand with the large, yet inflexible condensed system renders interesting properties to the catalyst, exemplified by the good catalytic performance and improved Z&#8208;selectivity. In addition, the complex can also serve as a hydrogenation catalyst in a consecutive (one&#8208;pot) reaction. The latter reaction can convert allyl acetate to butane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol, a valuable chemical intermediate for biodegradable polybutylene succinate (PBS).

         <title>Strategies for the Development of Asymmetric and Non&#8208;Directed Petasis Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 49, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Petasis reaction is a powerful multi&#8208;component method for the construction of highly functionalized amines. However, this transformation is limited in that it requires a directing group on the aldehyde component and asymmetric reports are scarce. This Concept highlights key strategies for asymmetric and non&#8208;directed Petasis reactions and suggests areas in the field where further methodology advancement is needed.







Abstract
The Petasis reaction is a multicomponent reaction of aldehydes, amines and organoboron reagents and is a useful method for the construction of substituted amines. Despite the significant advancement of the Petasis reaction since its invention in 1993, strategies for asymmetric and non&#8208;directed Petasis reactions remain limited. To date, there are very few catalytic asymmetric Petasis reactions and almost all asymmetric reports employ a chiral auxiliary. Likewise, the aldehyde component often requires a directing group, ultimately limiting the reaction's scope. In this Concept, key methods for asymmetric and non&#8208;directed Petasis reactions are discussed, focusing on how these conceptual advances can be applied to solve long&#8208;standing gaps in the Petasis literature.

         <dc:description>
The concept described the development of a chiral acetal&#8208;based stereo&#8208;controlled degradable polymer, which was prepared via living cascade enyne metathesis polymerization with the controlled addition of highly stereodefined N,O&#8208;acetal&#8208;containing enyne monomers from Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroamination of alkoxyallene and ring&#8208;closing metathesis.







Abstract
The precise synthesis of chiral polymers remains a significant challenge in polymer chemistry, particularly for applications in advanced biomedical and electronic materials. The development of degradable polymers is important for eco&#8208;friendly and advanced materials. Here, we introduce a stereo&#8208;controlled degradable polymer via cascade enyne metathesis polymerization and enantioselective acetal synthesis through Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroamination. This approach allows for the creation of chiral acetal&#8208;based polymers with controlled stereochemistry and degradability, highlighting their potential for use in drug delivery and electronic applications. This concept article reviews the background, development, and potential applications of these stereo&#8208;controlled degradable polymers.

         <title>Breaking Cycles: Saponification&#8208;Enhanced NMR Fingerprint Matching for the Identification and Stereochemical Evaluation of Cyclic Lipodepsipeptides from Natural Sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 49, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlocking the stereochemistry of cyclic lipodepsipeptides (CLiPs) is simplified and made more universal. By comparing the (CH&#945;) HSQC NMR fingerprint of linear diastereomeric sequences from automated synthesis with linearized natural compound obtained by controlled hydrolysis, the procedure for stereochemistry determination is streamlined. The adaptable approach enhances research efficiency across the diverse CLiP structural portfolio.







Abstract
We previously described NMR based fingerprint matching with peptide backbone resonances as a fast and reliable structural dereplication approach for Pseudomonas cyclic lipodepsipeptides (CLiPs). In combination with total synthesis of a small library of configurational CLiP congeners this also allows unambiguous determination of stereochemistry, facilitating structure&#8208;activity relationship studies and enabling three&#8208;dimensional structure determination. However, the on&#8208;resin macrocycle formation in the synthetic workflow brings considerable burden and limits universal applicability. This drawback is here removed altogether by also transforming the native CLiP into a linearized analogue by controlled saponification of the ester bond. This eliminates the need for macrocycle formation, limiting the synthesis effort to linear peptide analogues. NMR fingerprints of such linear peptide analogues display a sufficiently distinctive chemical shift fingerprint to act as effective discriminators. The approach is developed using viscosin group CLiPs and subsequently demonstrated on putisolvin, leading to a structural revision, and tanniamide from Pseudomonas ekonensis COR58, a newly isolated lipododecapeptide that defines a new group characterized by a ten&#8208;residue large macrocycle, the largest to date in the Pseudomonas CLiP portfolio. These examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the saponification&#8208; enhanced approach that broadens applicability of NMR fingerprint matching for the determination of the stereochemistry of CLiPs.

         <title>Tripodal BODIPY&#8208;Tagged and Functional Molecular Probes: Synthesis, Computational Investigations and Explorations by Multiphoton Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 49, September 2, 2024. </description>

We report on new and conjugatable tripodal compounds which open up the possibility for multiplexing with BODIPY tags for studies by confocal microscopy and 2P FLIM with structural and photochemical predictions underpinned by TD&#8208;DFT calculations.







Abstract
A range of novel BODIPY derivatives with a tripodal aromatic core was synthesized and characterized spectroscopically. These new fluorophores showed promising features as probes for in&#8197;vitro assays in live cells and offer strategic routes for further functionalization towards hybrid nanomaterials. Incorporation of biotin tags facilitated proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept access to targeted bioconjugates as molecular probes. Computational explorations using DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations identified the most stable tripodal linker conformations and predicted their absorption and emission behavior. The uptake and speciation of these molecules in living prostate cancer cells was imaged by single&#8208; and two&#8208;photon excitation techniques coupled with two&#8208;photon fluorescence lifetime imaging (2P FLIM).

         <title>In Situ Generation and High Bioresistance of Trityl&#8208;based Semiquinone Methide Radicals Under Anaerobic Conditions in Cellular Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 49, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ quantitative generation of trityl&#8208;based semiquinone methide radical OXQM&#8901; in cellular systems has been achieved from the quinone methide OXQM under anaerobic conditions. OXQM&#8901; with an EPR single line signal at physiological pH exhibits unprecedented high stability against bioreduction and thus shows great application potential in in&#8208;cell magnetic resonance&#8208;related techniques.







Abstract
Bioreduction of spin labels and polarizing agents (generally stable radicals) has been an obstacle limiting the in&#8208;cell applications of pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). In this work, we have demonstrated that two semiquinone methide radicals (OXQM&#8901; and CTQM&#8901;) can be easily produced from the trityl&#8208;based quinone methides (OXQM and CTQM) via reduction by various reducing agents including biothiols and ascorbate under anaerobic conditions. Both radicals have relatively low pKa's and exhibit EPR single line signals at physiological pH. Moreover, the bioreduction of OXQM in three cell lysates enables quantitative generation of OXQM&#8901; which was most likely mediated by flavoenzymes. Importantly, the resulting OXQM&#8901; exhibited extremely high stability in the E.coli lysate under anaerobic conditions with 76&#8208; and 14.3&#8208;fold slower decay kinetics as compared to the trityl OX063 and a gem&#8208;diethyl pyrrolidine nitroxide, respectively. Intracellular delivery of OXQM into HeLa cells was also achieved by covalent conjugation with a cell&#8208;permeable peptide as evidenced by the stable intracellular EPR signal from the OXQM&#8901; moiety. Owing to extremely high resistance of OXQM&#8901; towards bioreduction, OXQM and its derivatives show great application potential in in&#8208;cell EPR and in&#8208;cell DNP studies for various cells which can endure short&#8208;term anoxic treatments.

         <dc:description>
This research delves into the critical role of fast and efficient polyamine detection utilizing self&#8208;assembled, fluorescent chemosensors based on sulfonated pillar[5]arene as host and diazapyrene indicator dyes. Polyamine&#8208;selective and spermine&#8208;selective host&#8208;guest pairs are introduced. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the developed chemosensors in biofluids like human urine and saliva, offering promising advancements in biomedical diagnostics.







Abstract
Polyamines are essential analytes due to their critical role in various biological processes and human health in general. Due to their role as regulators for cell growth and proliferation (putrescine and spermine), as neuroprotectors, gero&#8208;, and cardiovascular protectors (spermidine), and as bacterial growth indicators (cadaverine), rapid, simple, and cost&#8208;effective methods for polyamine detection in biofluids are in demand. The present study focuses on the development and investigation of self&#8208;assembled and fluorescent host&#8901;dye chemo&#8208;sensors based on sulfonated pillar[5]arene for the specific detection of polyamines. Binding studies, as well as stability and functionality assessments of the turn&#8208;on chemosensors for selective polyamine detection in saline and biologically relevant media, are shown. Furthermore, the practical applicability of the developed chemo&#8208;sensors is demonstrated in biofluids such as human urine and saliva.

         <title>Elucidating the Mechanism of Efficient Eu(III) and Yb(III) Sensitisation from a Re(I) Tetrazolato Triangular Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 49, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triangular assembly featuring three Re(I) and three Eu(III) centres displays an unprecedented sensitisation efficiency, around 90&#8201;%, whereby the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligang charget transfer excited state of the Re(I) complex acts as a sensitiser for the Eu(III) emission. Spectroscopic investigation reveals that the sensitisation proceeds via a thermally activated two&#8208;step mechanism involving the bridging terpyridine ligand, and provides new insights for the design of d&#8208;f assemblies with efficient luminescent properties.







Abstract
The reaction of Re(CO)5Br with deprotonated 1H&#8208;(5&#8208;(2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine)pyrid&#8208;2&#8208;yl)tetrazole yields a triangular assembly formed by tricarbonyl Re(I) vertices. Photophysical measurements reveal blue&#8208;green emission with a maximum at 520&#8197;nm, 32&#8201;% quantum yield, and 2430&#8197;ns long&#8208;lived excited state decay lifetime in deaerated dichloromethane solution. Coordination of lanthanoid ions to the terpyridine units red&#8208;shifts the emission to 570&#8197;nm and also reveals efficient (90&#8201;%) and fast sensitisation of both Eu(III) and Yb(III) at room temperature, with a similar rate constant kET on the order of 107&#8197;s&#8722;1. Efficient sensitisation of Eu(III) from Re(I) is unprecedented, especially when considering the close proximity in energy between the donor and acceptor excited states. On the other hand, comparative measurements at 77&#8197;K reveal that energy transfer to Yb(III) is two orders of magnitude slower than that to Eu(III). A two&#8208;step mechanism of sensitisation is therefore proposed, whereby the rate&#8208;determining step is a thermally activated energy transfer step between the Re(I) centre and the terpyridine functionality, followed by rapid energy transfer to the respective Ln(III) excited states. At 77&#8197;K, the direct Re(I) to Eu(III) energy transfer seems to proceed via a ligand&#8208;mediated superexchange Dexter&#8208;type mechanism.

     alt="Elucidating the Mechanism of Efficient Eu(III) and Yb(III) Sensitisation from a Re(I) Tetrazolato Triangular Assembly"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A triangular assembly featuring three Re(I) and three Eu(III) centres displays an unprecedented sensitisation efficiency, around 90&#8201;%, whereby the metal-to-ligang charget transfer excited state of the Re(I) complex acts as a sensitiser for the Eu(III) emission. Spectroscopic investigation reveals that the sensitisation proceeds via a thermally activated two-step mechanism involving the bridging terpyridine ligand, and provides new insights for the design of d-f assemblies with efficient luminescent properties.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Stereoselective Crystallization of Chiral Pharmaceuticals Aided by Cellulose Derivatives through Helical Pattern Matching</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 49, September 2, 2024. </description>

A novel design principle of helical pattern matching between the polymeric additives and the crystal surfaces are proposed for the stereoselective crystallization of chiral pharmaceuticals. A novel design principle of helical pattern matching between polymeric additives and crystal surfaces is proposed for the stereoselective crystallization of chiral pharmaceuticals. This method, demonstrated with nimodipine, guaifenesin, and phenyl lactic acid, achieves high enantiomeric purity, highlighting a new strategy for using natural biomolecules in chiral recognition and resolution.







Abstract
Stereoselective inhibition aided by &#8220;tailor&#8208;made&#8221; polymeric additives is an efficient approach to obtain enantiopure compounds through conglomerate crystallization. The chemical and configurational match between the side groups of polymers and the molecules of undesired enantiomer is considered to be a necessary condition for successful stereoseparation. Whereas in this contribution, we present an effective resolution of chiral pharmaceuticals by using cellulose acetates as the additives, which stereoselectively reside on the specific crystal faces of one enantiomer and inhibit its crystal nucleation and growth through helical pattern and supramolecular interaction complementarity. An investigation of nimodipine serves as a case study to highlight the novelty of this strategy wherein R&#8208;crystals exhibiting an impressive enantiomeric excess value of 97&#8201;% can be attained by employing a mere 0.01&#8197;wt&#8201;% cellulose acetate. Guaifenesin and phenyl lactic acid are also well&#8208;resolved by utilizing this methodology. Our work not only brings about a brand&#8208;new design strategy for &#8220;tailor&#8208;made&#8221; additives, but will also promote the further exploration of the endless potential for utilizing natural biomolecules in chiral recognition and resolution.

         <title>Revisiting the Mechanism of Asymmetric Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Carbo&#8208;Carboxylation with CO2: The Additives Affect the Product Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 49, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT methods were used to revisit the mechanism of the Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive carbo&#8208;carboxylation of alkenes with CO2. Our results indicate that zinc salts can alter the product selectivity, whereas Mg(II) and Li(I) salts activate CO2 during C&#8722;CO2 bond formation.







Abstract
The mechanistic details of the asymmetric Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive cyclization/carboxylation of alkenes with CO2 have been revisited using DFT methods. Emphasis was put on the enantioselectivity and the mechanistic role of Lewis acid additives and in&#8197;situ formed salts. Our results show that oxidative addition of the substrate is rate&#8208;limiting, with the formed Ni(II)&#8208;aryl intermediate preferring a triplet spin state. After reduction to Ni(I), enantioselective cyclization of the substrate occurs, followed by inner sphere carboxylation. Our proposed mechanism reproduces the experimentally observed enantiomeric excess and identifies critical C&#8722;H/O and C&#8722;H/N interactions that affect the selectivity. Further, our results highlight the beneficial effect of Lewis acids on CO2 insertion and suggest that in&#8197;situ formed salts influence if the 5&#8208;exo or 6&#8208;endo product will be formed.

CeO2@ICG@GOx@HA nanozyme with self&#8208;accelerated cascade reactions achieve combined tumor treatment including photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, chemodynamic therapy and starvation therapy. CeO2@ICG@GOx@HA nanoplatform with negligible systemic toxicity not only overcomes the defects of natural enzymes and single&#8208;modal tumor therapy, but also provides an ideal combinational therapeutic treatment for tumor therapy with high efficiency.







Abstract
Nanozymes have obvious advantages in improving the efficiency of cancer treatment. However, due to the lack of tissue specificity, low catalytic efficiency, and so on, their clinical applications are limited. Herein, the nanoplatform CeO2@ICG@GOx@HA (CIGH) with self&#8208;accelerated cascade reactions is constructed. The as&#8208;prepared nanozyme shows the superior oxidase (OXD)&#8208;like, superoxide dismutase (SOD)&#8208;like, catalase (CAT)&#8208;like and peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like activities. At the same time, under 808&#8197;nm near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation, the photodynamic and photothermal capabilities are also significantly enhanced due to the presence of indocyanine green (ICG). We demonstrate that the nanozyme CIGH can efficiently accumulate in the tumor and exhibit amplified cascade antitumor effects with negligible systemic toxicity through the combination of photodynamic therapy (PDT), photothermal therapy (PTT), chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and starvation therapy. The nanozyme prepared in this study provides a promising candidate for catalytic nanomedicines for efficient tumor therapy.

         <title>Lyso&#8208;H2S: A Mycophenolic Acid&#8208;Derived Probe for Ultra&#8208;Low Toxicity, Intracellular H2S Detection, and Zebrafish Model Validation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 49, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the MPA scaffold&#8208;inspired fluorescent probe Lyso&#8208;H2S that allows H2S detection with an LOD of 41.8&#8197;nM. It is a highly sensitive and selective fluorescent probe that detects H2S in lysosomes based on the PET+ ESIPT sensing mechanism. The probe allows for real&#8208;time monitoring of H2S in vivo, particularly in the intestine and gallbladder of a zebrafish. Lyso&#8208;H2S was successfully employed in the endogenous and exogenous imaging of H2S in living cells.







Abstract
In several biological processes, H2S is known to function as an endogenous gaseous agent. It is very necessary to monitor H2S and relevant physiological processes in&#8197;vivo. Herein, a new type of fluorophore with a reliable leaving group allows for excited&#8208;state intramolecular transfer characteristics (ESIPT), inspired by mycophenolic acid. A morpholine ring was connected at the maleimide position of the probe to target the lysosome. Subsequently, the dinitrophenyl group known for a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) effect, was connected to allow for an effective &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; probe Lyso&#8208;H2S. Lyso&#8208;H2S demonstrated strong selectivity towards H2S, a large Stokes shift (111&#8197;nm), and an incredibly low detection limit (41.8&#8197;nM). The imaging of endogenous and exogenous H2S in living cells (A549&#8197;cell line) was successfully achieved because of the specificity and ultra&#8208;low toxicity (100&#8201;% cell viability at 50&#8197;&#956;M concentration of Lyso&#8208;H2S.) Additionally, Lyso&#8208;H2S was also employed to visualize the activity of H2S in the gallbladder and intestine in a living zebrafish model. This is the first report of a fluorescent probe to track H2S sensing in specific organ systems to our knowledge.

     alt="Lyso-H2S: A Mycophenolic Acid-Derived Probe for Ultra-Low Toxicity, Intracellular H2S Detection, and Zebrafish Model Validation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the MPA scaffold-inspired fluorescent probe Lyso-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S that allows H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S detection with an LOD of 41.8&#8197;nM. It is a highly sensitive and selective fluorescent probe that detects H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S in lysosomes based on the PET+ ESIPT sensing mechanism. The probe allows for real-time monitoring of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S in vivo, particularly in the intestine and gallbladder of a zebrafish. Lyso-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S was successfully employed in the endogenous and exogenous imaging of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S in living cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In several biological processes, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is known to function as an endogenous gaseous agent. It is very necessary to monitor H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and relevant physiological processes in&#8197;vivo. Herein, a new type of fluorophore with a reliable leaving group allows for excited-state intramolecular transfer characteristics (ESIPT), inspired by mycophenolic acid. A morpholine ring was connected at the maleimide position of the probe to target the lysosome. Subsequently, the dinitrophenyl group known for a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) effect, was connected to allow for an effective &#8220;turn-on&#8221; probe &lt;b&gt;Lyso-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;b&gt;Lyso-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;/b&gt; demonstrated strong selectivity towards H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, a large Stokes shift (111&#8197;nm), and an incredibly low detection limit (41.8&#8197;nM). The imaging of endogenous and exogenous H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S in living cells (A549&#8197;cell line) was successfully achieved because of the specificity and ultra-low toxicity (100&#8201;% cell viability at 50&#8197;&#956;M concentration of &lt;b&gt;Lyso-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;.) Additionally, &lt;b&gt;Lyso-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;/b&gt; was also employed to visualize the activity of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S in the gallbladder and intestine in a living zebrafish model. This is the first report of a fluorescent probe to track H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S sensing in specific organ systems to our knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Itaconic Acid Derivatives via Chemodivergent Single and Double Carboxylation of Allenes with CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 49, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Allenoates prove competence in the synthesis of itaconic acid derivatives and tri&#8208;carboxylated compounds via site&#8208;selective electrochemical fixation of one or two molecules of CO2 (yields up to 87&#8201;%). Complete chemodivergency is realized via dedicated electrolytic conditions optimization.







Abstract
Leveraging electrochemistry, a new synthesis of non&#8208;natural derivatives of itaconic acid is proposed by utilizing carbon dioxide (CO2) as a valuable C1 synthon. An electrochemical cross&#8208;electrophile coupling between allenoates and CO2 was targeted, allowing for the synthesis of both mono&#8208; and di&#8208;carboxylation products in a catalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free environment (yields up to 87&#8201;%, 30 examples). Elaboration of the model mono&#8208;carboxylation product, and detailed cyclovoltammetric, as well as mechanistic analyses complete the present investigation.

         <title>A Phosphoramidate Prodrug Platform: One&#8208;Pot Amine Functionalization of Kinase Inhibitors with Oligoethylene Glycol for Improved Water&#8208;Solubility</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 49, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot approach is employed for the transformation of three different kinase inhibitors into oligoethylene glycol&#8208;functionalized prodrugs. These prodrugs exhibit superior solubility in water and improved cell uptake in HeLa cells. The phosphoramidate&#8208;based promoiety provides a universal platform for drugs with amine groups, enabling acid&#8208;catalyzed drug release within target cells.







Abstract
Small molecular kinase inhibitors play a key role in modern cancer therapy. Protein kinases are essential mediators in the growth and progression of cancerous tumors, rendering involved kinases an increasingly important target for therapy. However, kinase inhibitors are almost insoluble in water because of their hydrophobic aromatic nature, often lowering their availability and pharmacological efficacy. Direct drug functionalization with polar groups represents a simple strategy to improve the drug solubility, availability, and performance. Here, we present a strategy to functionalize secondary amines with oligoethylene glycol (OEG) phosphate using a one&#8208;pot synthesis in three exemplary kinase inhibiting drugs Ceritinib, Crizotinib, and Palbociclib. These OEG&#8208;prodrug conjugates demonstrate superior solubility in water compared to the native drugs, with the solubility increasing up to 190&#8208;fold. The kinase inhibition potential is only slightly decreased for the conjugates compared to the native drugs. We further show pH dependent hydrolysis of the OEG&#8208;prodrugs which releases the native drug. We observe a slow release at pH&#8197;3, while the conjugates remain stable over 96&#8197;h under physiological conditions (pH&#8197;7.4). Using confocal microscopy, we verify improved cell uptake of the drug&#8208;OEG conjugates into the cytoplasm of HeLa cells, further supporting our universal solubility approach.

         <title>Expedited Proton Relay in Enzyme&#8208;Inspired Cobaloximes Facilitate Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 49, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We illustrate the oxygen&#8208;tolerant and benign nature of active bio&#8208;inspired cobaloxime complexes featuring the axial coordination with imidazole or histidine. These complexes provide efficient chemical transformations like amine synthesis. This transformation is complemented by concur&#8208;rent evolution of H2 through synergistic utilization of a photocatalyst and a cobaloxime&#8208;based catalyst.







Abstract
Developing a water&#8208;soluble, oxygen&#8208;tolerant, and acid&#8208;stable synthetic H2 production catalyst is vital for renewable energy infrastructure. To access such an effective catalyst, we strategically incorporated enzyme&#8208;inspired, multicomponent outer coordination sphere elements around the cobaloxime (Cl&#8722;Co&#8722;X) core with suitable axial coordination (X). Our cobaloximes with axial imidazole or L&#8208;histidine coordination in photocatalytic HAT including the construction of anilines via a non&#8208;canonical cross&#8208;coupling approach is found superior compared to commonly used cobaloxime catalysts. The reversible Co(II)/Co(I) process is influenced by the axial N ligand's nature. Imidazole/L&#8208;histidine with a higher pKa promptly produces H2 upon irradiation, leading to the improved reactivity compared to previously employed axial (di)chloride or pyridine analogue.

         <title>Corrin Ring Modifications Reveal the Chemical and Spatial Requirements for the B12&#8208;btuB Riboswitch Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 49, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To find the structural requirements of a B12&#8208;derivative to bind and switch the btuB riboswitch we derivatised the corrin sidechains b and e as well as the apical ligand. While modifications at the sidechains have a large impact on the riboswitch, introduction of an apical adenosyl&#8208;ligand restores the riboswitch fold.







Abstract
The btuB riboswitch is a regulatory RNA sequence controlling gene expression of the outer membrane B12 transport protein BtuB by specifically binding coenzyme B12 (AdoCbl) as its natural ligand. The B12 sensing riboswitch class is known to accept various B12 derivatives, leading to a division into two riboswitch subclasses, dependent on the size of the apical ligand. Here we focus on the role of side chains b and e on affinity and proper recognition, i.&#8201;e. correct structural switch of the btuB RNA, which belongs to the AdoCbl&#8208;binding class I. Chemical modification of these side chains disturbs crucial hydrogen bonds and/or electrostatic interactions with the RNA, its effect on both affinity and switching being monitored by in&#8208;line probing. Chemical modifications at sidechain b of vitamin B12 show larger effects indicating crucial B12&#8208;RNA interactions. When introducing the same modification to AdoCbl the influence of any side&#8208;chain modification tested is reduced. This renders the impact of the adenosyl&#8208;ligand for B12&#8208;btuB riboswitch recognition clearly beyond the known role in affinity.

         <title>Achieving Non&#8208;Interfacial Blocking Zinc Ion Transport Based on MOF Derived Manganese Oxides and Amorphous Carbon Hybrid Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 49, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Base on the combination of co&#8208;precipitation method and carbonization, the architecture of non&#8208;interfacial blocking manganese oxides and amorphous carbon hybrid materials are synthesized. MOF&#8208;derived hybrid electrodes obtained a specific capacity of 132.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and it still has a specific capacity of 105&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for 2000 cycles. In addition, the electrode reaction mechanism of MOF&#8208;derived hybrid electrodes in ZIBs is analyzed by ex&#8208;situ XRD and in&#8208;situ Raman tests and the model battery is assembled to present practical possibilities. This study provides an innovation strategy for efficient electron ion transport of Mn&#8208;based materials, and offers a route to the practical electrode of ZIBs.







Abstract
How to coordinate electron and ion transport behavior across scales and interfaces within ion battery electrodes? The exponential increase in surface area observed in nanoscale electrode materials results in an incomprehensibly vast spatial interval. Herein, to address the problems of volume expansion, dissolution of cathode material, and the charge accumulation problem existing in manganiferous materials for zinc ion batteries, metal organic framework is utilized to form the architecture of non&#8208;interfacial blocking ~10&#8197;nm Mn2O3 nanoparticles and amorphous carbon hybrid electrode materials, demonstrating a high specific capacity of 361&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and excellent cycle stability of 105&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles under 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The uniform and non&#8208;separated disposition of Mn and C atoms constitutes an interconnected network with high electronic and ionic conductivity, minimizing issues like structural collapse and volume expansion of the electrode material during cycling. The cooperative insert mechanism of H+ and Zn2+ are analyzed via ex&#8208;situ XRD and in&#8208;situ Raman tests. The model battery is assembled to present practical possibilities. The results indicate that MOF&#8208;derived carbonization provides an effective strategy for exploring Mn&#8208;based electrode materials with high ion and electron transport capacity.

         <title>The Excited State Dynamics of a Mutagenic Guanosine Etheno Adduct Investigated by Femtosecond Fluorescence Spectroscopy and Quantum Mechanical Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 49, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mutagenic etheno adduct of guanine exhibits a peculiar behavior of its lowest singlet excited state. The two independent and short&#8208;lived emission bands revealed by femtosecond upconversion fluorescence are associated with two strongly coupled bright minima of different geometry. Overall, the presence of the extra etheno ring on guanine slows down the efficient relaxation pathways, which are essential for the DNA photostability.







Abstract
Femtosecond fluorescence upconversion experiments were combined with CASPT2 and time dependent DFT calculations to characterize the excited state dynamics of the mutagenic etheno adduct 1,N2&#8208;etheno&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyguanosine (&#1013;dG). This endogenously formed lesion is attracting great interest because of its ubiquity in human tissues and its highly mutagenic properties. The &#1013;dG fluorescence is strongly modified with respect to that of the canonical nucleoside dG, notably by an about 6&#8208;fold increase in fluorescence lifetime and quantum yield at neutral pH. In addition, femtosecond fluorescence upconversion experiments reveal the presence of two emission bands with maxima at 335&#8197;nm for the shorter&#8208;lived and 425&#8197;nm for the longer&#8208;lived. Quantum mechanical calculations rationalize these findings and provide absorption and fluorescence spectral shapes similar to the experimental ones. Two different bright minima are located on the potential energy surface of the lowest energy singlet excited state. One planar minimum, slightly more stable, is associated with the emission at 335&#8197;nm, whereas the other one, with a bent etheno ring, is associated with the red&#8208;shifted emission.

         <title>Biomimetic Capsid&#8208;Like Nanoshells Self&#8208;Assembled from Homopolypeptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 49, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic capsid&#8208;like nanoshells (CLNs) were prepared through the solution self&#8208;assembly of poly (&#946;&#8208;phenethyl&#8208;L&#8208;aspartate) homopolypeptide (PPLA). The formation of CLNs follows an aggregation&#8208;fusion process, where the molecular flexibility of PPLA is crucial for the arrangement and fusion of subunits (SSA). These findings offer new perspectives for a deeper understanding of the formation pathways of CLNs derived from synthetic polymers.







Abstract
The preparation of capsid&#8208;like nanoshells and the elucidation of their formation pathways are crucial for the application potential of capsid&#8208;like nanomaterials. In this study, we have prepared biomimetic capsid&#8208;like nanoshells (CLNs) through the solution self&#8208;assembly of poly (&#946;&#8208;phenethyl&#8208;L&#8208;aspartate) homopolypeptide (PPLA). The formation of CLNs is governed by an aggregation&#8208;fusion mechanism. Initially, PPLA molecules self&#8208;assemble into small spherical assemblies as subunits and the initial nuclei are formed through fusing some subunits. Subsequently, additional subunits rapidly fuse onto these nuclei, leading to the growth of full or partial CLNs during the growth phase. Moreover, the suitable condition benefiting CLNs formation is clarified by a morphological phase diagram based on the initial PPLA concentration against water content. Molecular&#8208;level measurements suggest that the molecular flexibility of PPLA is a key factor in the arrangement and fusion of subunits for the formation of CLNs. These findings offer new perspectives for a deeper understanding of the formation pathways of capsid&#8208;like nanoshells derived from synthetic polymers.

[9]&#8208; and [10]&#8208;Cycloparaphenylenes encapsulate borospherene B40 forming host&#8208;guest complexes with comparable complexation energy to carbon fullerenes, exhibiting double host&#8208;guest aromaticity at the dioxidized state.







Abstract
Supramolecular complexes of carbon nanohoops with fullerenes play a key role for the design of novel nanomaterials with technological applications. Herein we investigate with density functional theory (DFT) methods the capability of neutral and dioxidized cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) to encapsulate all&#8208;boron fullerene B40. Our results show that [9]CPP and [10]CPP are feasible host candidates to encapsulate B40 displaying comparable complexation energies with the all&#8208;carbon analog [10]CPP&#8835;C60. Upon dioxidation the host&#8208;guest interactions are not affected, whereas the positive charge is delocalized on the CPPs leading to global aromatic character of the hosts. Consequently, the dicationic complexes [n]CPP2+&#8835;B40 and [10]CPP2+&#8835;C60 display augmented global shielding cones that strongly shield the guests, as manifested by large upfield shifts in 11B&#8208;NMR and 13C&#8208;NMR signals. Hence, CPP complexes with carbon fullerenes can be extended borospherene B40 host&#8208;guest complexes, as well as to doubly oxidized species stabilized by global host aromaticity, expanding our understanding of carbon nanohoop complexes to boron&#8208;based fullerenes.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Breaking and Symmetry&#8208;Retaining Morphological Evolution of the Single Crystals of Cyclodextrin Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 49, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing lower symmetry elements (&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrins and &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins) into a high symmetry system (&#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework), two different morphology evolution paths have been realized, representing symmetry&#8208;retaining and symmetry&#8208;breaking, respectively.







Abstract
The morphological symmetry&#8208;retaining and symmetry&#8208;breaking of single crystals of the &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin metal&#8208;organic framework have been achieved via introducing lower symmetric &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrins and &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins, respectively. &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrins led to a morphological evolution with retained symmetry from cubic to rhombic dodecahedra, while &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins resulted in the original cubic crystal missing a vertex angle presenting symmetry&#8208;breaking behavior. The crystal structures of rhombic dodecahedra and angle&#8208;deficient crystals were confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallography, and the mechanisms underlying the morphological transformation evolution were further analyzed. Our work not only provides a rare case realizing two different paths of morphological evolution in one system, but also encourages future efforts towards the evolution of artificial crystal systems in a natural way.

         <title>ABNOH&#8208;Linked Nucleotides and DNA for Bioconjugation and Cross&#8208;linking with Tryptophan&#8208;Containing Peptides and Proteins</title>

Reactive probes based on ABNOH&#8208;linked nucleotides, oligonucleotides or DNA were designed and synthesized for specific cross&#8208;linking and bioconjugation with tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides and proteins.







Abstract
Reactive N&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;9&#8208;azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (ABNOH) linked 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine 5&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;mono&#8208; and triphosphates were synthesized through a CuAAC reaction of ABNOH&#8208;PEG4&#8208;N3 with 5&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;dUMP or &#8208;dUTP. The modified triphosphate was used as substrate for enzymatic synthesis of modified DNA probes with KOD XL DNA polymerase. The keto&#8208;ABNO radical reacted with tryptophan (Trp) and Trp&#8208;containing peptides to form a stable tricyclic fused hexahydropyrrolo&#8208;indole conjugates. Similarly modified ABNOH&#8208;linked nucleotides reacted with Trp&#8208;containing peptides to form a stable conjugate in the presence but surprisingly even in the absence of NaNO2 (presumably through activation by O2). The reactive ABNOH&#8208;modified DNA probe was used for bioconjugations and crosslinking with Trp&#8208;containing peptides or proteins.

         <title>Proton Conducting Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) via Post Synthetic Transmetallation and Water Induced Structural Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 49, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bimetallic MOFs are demonstrated to exhibit transmetallation via post synthetic modifications. The green crystals of Cu&#8208;MOF convert to blue crystals via single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation as the coordinated DMA is exchanged with water. These MOFs exhibit notable proton conductivities ranging from 10&#8722;3 to 10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 under variable temperatures and humidity levels.







Abstract
Post Synthetic Modification (PSM) of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) is a crucial strategy for developing new MOFs with enhanced functional properties compared to their parent one. PSM can be accomplished through various methods:1) modification of organic linkers; 2) exchange of metal ions or nodes; and 3) inclusion or exchange of solvent/guest molecules. Herein, PSM of bimetallic and monometallic MOFs containing biphenyl dinitro&#8208;tetra&#8208;carboxylates (NCA) are demonstrated. The tetra carboxylate NCA, produces monometallic Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 and Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 and bimetallic CoZn&#8208;MOF in solvothermal reactions with the corresponding metal salts. The CoZn&#8208;MOF undergoes post&#8208;synthetic transmetallation with Cd(NO3)2 and Cu(NO3)2 in aqueous solution to yield Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 and Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;2, respectively. Additionally, green crystals of Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 found to undergo a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation to blue crystals of Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;3 upon dipped into water at room temperature. These MOFs demonstrate notable proton conductivities ranging from 10&#8722;3 to 10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 under variable temperatures and humidity levels. Among them, Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;3 achieves the highest proton conductivity of 1.36&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 90&#8201;&#176;C and 98&#8201;% relative humidity, attributed to its continuous and extensive hydrogen bonding network, which provides effective proton conduction pathways within the MOF. This work highlights a convenient strategy for designing proton&#8208;conducting MOFs via post&#8208;synthetic modification.

Double imaging photoelectron photo&#8208;ion coincidence spectroscopy using vacuum ultraviolet synchrotron radiation reveals the thermal decomposition mechanism of trimethyl phosphate, a fire&#8208;retardant additive candidate of lithium&#8208;ion battery electrolytes. A dimethyl ether production channel was confirmed by thermolysis experiments and quantum chemical calculations. This fundamental understanding can help the development of a chemical kinetic model and the design of better fire suppressants.







Abstract
Trimethyl phosphate (TMP), an organophosphorus compound (OPC), is a promising fire&#8208;retardant candidate for lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) electrolytes to mitigate fire spread. This study aims to understand the mechanism of TMP unimolecular thermal decomposition to support the integration of a TMP chemical kinetic model into a LIB electrolyte surrogate model. Reactive intermediates and products of TMP thermal decomposition were experimentally detected using vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) synchrotron radiation and double imaging photoelectron photoion coincidence (i2PEPICO) spectroscopy. Phosphorus&#8208;containing intermediates such as PO, HPO and HPO2 were identified. Sampling effects could successfully be obviated thanks to photoion imaging, which also showed evidence for isomerization reactions upon wall collisions in the ionization chamber. Quantum chemical calculations performed for the unimolecular decomposition of TMP revealed for the first time that isomerization channels via hydrogen and methyl transfer (barrier heights of 65.9 and 72.6&#8197;kcal/mol, respectively) are the lowest&#8208;energy primary steps of TMP decomposition followed by CH3OH/CH3/CH2O or dimethyl ether (DME) production, respectively. We found an analogous DME production channel in the unimolecular decomposition of dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP), another important OPC fire&#8208;retardant additive with a similar molecular structure to TMP, which are not included in currently available chemical kinetic models.

         <title>Front Cover: Breaking Cycles: Saponification&#8208;Enhanced NMR Fingerprint Matching for the Identification and Stereochemical Evaluation of Cyclic Lipodepsipeptides from Natural Sources (Chem. Eur. J. 49/2024)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 49, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Access to the stereochemistry of a cyclic lipodepsipeptide of bacterial origin can be gained by matching its NMR proton&#8211;carbon spectral fingerprint against that of a synthetic library of analogues each with defined stereochemistry. This approach holds when the lipopeptide macrocycle is first broken by selective ester bond hydrolysis, thus limiting the required synthetic effort to a library of linear lipopeptides, reducing effort and broadening the application potential. More information can be found in the Research Article by N. Geudens, J.&#8197;C. Martins and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400667).

An alternative solution to the problem of plastic waste is the development of chemical processes that enable the synthesis of sustainable materials from persistent plastics. The catalytic decomposition of post&#8208;consumer HDPE waste by isomerization metathesis (ISOMET) enables the production of propylene, the precursor of allyl acetate. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401918), M. Nagyh&#225;zi, R. Tuba and co&#8208;workers recount their development of new ruthenium catalysts that can carry out consecutive olefin metathesis and hydrogenation reactions of allyl acetate to butane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol, the precursor of biodegradable and chemically recyclable materials, including polybutylene succinate (PBS).

         <title>MXene Synthesis and Carbon Capture Applications: Mini&#8208;Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 49, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review emphasizes the significant advancements made in the precise synthesis of MXenes, which is crucial for tailoring the properties of MXenes to suit specific applications. Furthermore, the review highlights the immense potential of MXene&#8208;based materials for carbon capture applications.







Abstract
MXenes, a class of two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, have garnered significant attention due to their remarkable potential for energy storage, electrocatalysis, and gas separation applications. The fabrication processes of MXene involve building up the MXene structure from constituent elements and the selective elimination of M&#8722;A bonds from the precursor MAX.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MXenes, a class of two-dimensional transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, have garnered significant attention due to their remarkable potential for energy storage, electrocatalysis, and gas separation applications. The fabrication processes of MXene involve building up the MXene structure from constituent elements and the selective elimination of M&#8722;A bonds from the precursor MAX. However, considerable efforts are still required to design and develop efficient MXene-based technologies. This review article aims to briefly analyse the synthesis methods employed for MXene production, ranging from direct synthesis and conventional chemical wet etching approach to the more recent molten salt etching technique. The review highlights the advancements made in achieving precise control over the terminal groups, which is paramount for tailoring the properties of MXenes for specific applications. Furthermore, the potential of MXene-based materials for carbon capture applications, particularly in developing advanced adsorbents, is emphasized. The in-depth examination of MXene synthesis techniques and their implications for carbon capture applications provides a solid foundation for developing and optimizing these promising materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reaction via Vinylidene Ortho&#8208;Quinone Methides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 49, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A review of chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reaction via VQMs with emphasis on methodology innovation and mechanistic rationale is summarized. The remained challenges and opportunities for potential breakthroughs in this area are also presented.







Abstract
Vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methides (VQMs) have been proven to be versatile and crucial intermediates in the catalytic asymmetric reaction in last decade, and thus have drawn considerable concentrations on account of the practical application in the construction of enantiomerically pure functional organic molecules. However, in comparison to the well established chiral Br&#248;nsted base&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reaction via VQMs, chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction is rarely studied and there is no systematic summary to date. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in the chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reaction via VQMs according to three types of reactions: a) intermolecular asymmetric nucleophilic addition to VQMs; b) intermolecular asymmetric cycloaddition of VQMs; c) intramolecular asymmetric cyclization of VQMs. Finally, we put forward the remained challenges and opportunities for potential breakthroughs in this area.

         <title>Towards Sustainable Materials: A Review of Acylhydrazone Chemistry for Reversible Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 49, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the advancements in acylhydrazone dynamic chemistry within reversible polymers and its various applications in materials chemistry. Additionally, it investigates the potential for polymer reprocessing and recycling to support the circular economy.







Abstract
Transitioning towards a circular economy, extensive research has focused on dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs) to pave the way for more sustainable materials. These bonds enable debonding and rebonding on demand, as well as facilitating end&#8208;of&#8208;life recycling. Acylhydrazone/hydrazone chemistry offers a material with high stability under neutral and basic conditions making it a promising candidate for materials research, though the material is susceptible to acid degradation. However, this degradation under acidic conditions can be exploited, making it widely applicable in self&#8208;healing and biomedical fields, with potential for reprocessing and recycling. This review highlights studies exploring the reversibility of acylhydrazone/hydrazone bonds in various polymers, altering their properties, and utilizing them in applications such as self&#8208;healing, reprocessing, and recycling. The review also focuses on how the mechanical properties are affected by the presence of dynamic linkages, and methods to improve the mechanical performance.

         <title>Differential Sensing Approach as a Pattern&#8208;based Discrimination for Biological Samples</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The differential sensing approach uses fingerprint patterning to distinguish uncharacterized biological samples. Inspired by natural sensory systems, an array of cross&#8208;reactive sensors generates unique response fingerprint depending on the samples. Until today, this array system has been developed using various materials, including the library of surface&#8208;charged nanoparticles and chemosensors. Many differential array systems have demonstrated accurate identification of bacterial species, viral subtypes, and cancer cells, as well as distinguishing disease states in blood or urine. This capability is particularly important for distinguishing between normal and abnormal states when specific marker molecules have not yet been identified, providing a powerful diagnostic tool. In this concept, we summarized representative outcomes of differential sensing applications for biological sample discrimination.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering the cell surface sugar&#8208;coating via Biochemical Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cell surface components, specifically glycans, play a significant role in several biological functions like cell structure, crosstalk between cells, and eventual target recognition of the cells for therapeutics. The dense layer of glycans, i.e., glycocalyx, could differ in taxon, species, and cell type. Glycans are coupled with lipids and proteins to form glycolipids, glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol&#8208;anchored proteins, making their study challenging. However, understanding glycosylation at the cellular level is vital for fundamental research and the advancement of glycan&#8208;targeted therapy. Among different pathways, metabolic glycan labelling uses the natural metabolic processes of the cell to introduce abiotic functionality into glycan residues. The Bertozzi group pioneered metabolic oligosaccharide engineering using glycan salvage pathways to convert monosaccharides with unnatural modifications. This eventually results in the probe becoming part of the complex cellular glycan structures via click chemistry using copper. On the other hand, the boronic acid&#8208;based probe can recognise carbohydrates in a single step without any chemical modification of the surface. This review discusses the significance of glycans as biomarkers for different diseases and the necessity to evaluate them in situ within the physiological environment. The review also discusses the prospect of this field and its potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Formate Salt as a Bifunctional Reagent for Hydroxylation and Carbonylation Reactions Under Photochemically Driven Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we disclose for the first time that formate salt can be used as a bifunctional reagent for the synthesis of phenol derivatives and as a CO source for carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling processes using the COware gas reactor under activation free conditions. Key to this success is the in&#8208;situ synthesis of aryl formate via an unprecedented nickel/organophotocatalyst system under blue LED irradiation. This developed system demonstrated high applicability to various aryl iodide substrates for synthesizing phenol derivatives. Moreover, the generated CO could be utilized in a range of carbonylative C&#8208;heteroatom and C&#8208;C processes. Notably, commercially available H13COONa salt can serve as a bifunctional reagent for both synthesizing phenols and generating 13CO.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformation Regulation of Trisresorcinarene Directed by Cavity Solvation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This compound is a synthetic macrocycle comprising three pivaloyl&#8208;protected resorcinarene units connected by six pentylene chains. We conducted a conformational study using 1H&#8208;NMR, X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and computational analyses. The macrocycle adopts two conformers, one open, the other closed. The ratio of the open to closed forms depended on the solvent used. Only the open form existed in [D8]toluene, both forms coexisted in [D6]benzene, and the closed form was the major conformer in [D1]chloroform. The benzene&#8208;solvated open form observed in the solid state suggests that cavity solvation by solvent molecules directs the open form. The open form was the major or only conformer in [D10]o&#8208; and [D10]m&#8208;xylene and [D12]mesitylene, whereas the closed form was the major conformer in [D6]acetone. The open and closed forms were equally populated in [D10]p&#8208;xylene, suggesting that the size, shape, and dimensions of the solvent molecules most likely influenced the conformation of the protected trisresocinarene.</dc:description>

The benzene-solvated open form observed in the solid state suggests that cavity solvation by solvent molecules directs the open form. The open form was the major or only conformer in [D10]o- and [D10]m-xylene and [D12]mesitylene, whereas the closed form was the major conformer in [D6]acetone. The open and closed forms were equally populated in [D10]p-xylene, suggesting that the size, shape, and dimensions of the solvent molecules most likely influenced the conformation of the protected trisresocinarene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A synthetic method of tertiary alcohols was developed based on the formal umpolung addition of aryl ketones with electrophiles utilizing the [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement under Br&#248;nsted base catalysis. The addition reaction of &#945;&#8208;hydroxyphosphonates, derived from alkyl aryl&#8208; and diaryl ketones, with electrophiles such as phenyl vinyl sulfone, afforded phosphates having a tertiary alkyl group, which were readily convertible to the corresponding tertiary benzylic alcohols. This operationally simple protocol provides efficient complementary access to tertiary alcohols that are difficult to synthesize by conventional methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to diverse carbonyl compounds by catalyst&#8208;free and photoinduced aerobic cleavage of C=N bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functional group interconversion is of great significance in organic synthesis. However, aerobic cleavage of C=N bonds to access carbonyl compounds still suffered from some limitations such as harsh reaction conditions, stoichiometric oxidants, poor substrate scope and use of toxic reagents. Herein, we report a catalyst&#8208;free and photo&#8208;induced aerobic cleavage of C=N bonds to afford diverse carbonyl compounds using oxygen from air as green oxidant. This mild methodology permits N&#8208;tosylhydrazones converted into the corresponding carbonyl compounds including ketones, amides, aldehydes and carboxylic acids, showing broad functional group tolerance and compatibility. Moreover, the gram&#8208;scale reaction and post&#8208;modification of complicated molecules proved the applicability and efficiency of this strategy. Finally, a plausible mechanism was proposed based on spectroscopic investigations and detailed mechanistic studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferrocenyl Dithiophosphonate Ag(I) Complexes: Synthesis, Structures, Luminescence, and Electrocatalytic Water Splitting Tuned by Nuclearity and Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The heterometallic [Ag(I)/Fe(II)] molecular electrocatalysts for hydrogen production were introduced here to recognize the mutual role of metallic nuclearity and ligand engineering. A series of ferrocenyl dithiophosphonate stabilized mononuclear [Ag(PPh3)2{S2PFc(OR)}] {where R = Me (1), Et (2), nPr (3), iPr (4), iAmyl (5); Fc = Fe (&#627;5&#8208;C5H4)(&#627;5&#8208;C5H5) } and dinuclear [Ag(PPh3){S2PFc(OR}]2 {where R = Et (2a), and nPr (3a)} complexes were synthesized and characterized by SCXRD, NMR (31P and 1H), ESI&#8208;MS, UV&#8208;Vis, and FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy. The comparative electrocatalytic HER behavior of 1&#8722;5 and 2a&#8722;3a showed effective current density of 1 mA/cm2 with overpotentials ranging from 772 to 991 mV, demonstrating the influence of extended and branched carbon chains in dithiophosphonates and metallic (mono&#8208;/di&#8208;) nuclearity, which correlates with documented tetra&#8208;nuclear [Ag4(S2PFc(OnPr)4], 6. DFT study suggests the coordinated (&#956;1&#8208;S) site of ligands is the reactivity center and the adsorption energy of intermediate [H*&#8208;SM] varies with the engineering of ligand and nuclearity. A catalytic mechanism using mononuclear (1) and di&#8208;nuclear (2a) was proposed with the assistance of DFT. Each complex, being the first example of Ag(I) dithiophosphonates, exhibits intense photoluminescence with high quantum yields ranging from 33% to 67%. These results link the lower nuclearity structures to their physical and catalytic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescence of Aggregated Aromatic Peptides for Studying the Kinetics of Aggregation and Hardening of Amyloid&#8208;like Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic fluorescence anisotropy of peptide based amyloid&#8208;like structures gives clues about kinetics of aggregation and hardening of these supramolecular architectures.







Abstract
The capability of amyloid&#8208;like peptide fibers to emit intrinsic&#8208;fluorescence enables the study of their formation, stability and hardening through time&#8208;resolved fluorescence analysis, without the need for additional intercalating dyes. This approach allows the monitoring of amyloid&#8208;like peptides aggregation kinetics using minimal sample volumes, and the simultaneous testing of numerous experimental conditions and analytes, offering rapid and reproducible results. The analytical procedure applied to the aromatic hexapeptide F6, alone or derivatized with PEG (polyethylene glycol) moiety of different lengths, suggests that aggregation into large anisotropic structures negatively correlates with initial monomer concentration and relies on the presence of charged N&#8208; and C&#8208;termini. PEGylation reduces the extent of aggregates hardening, possibly by retaining water, and overall impacts the final structural properties of the aggregates.

         <title>Fluorogenic in&#8208;situ Labelling of Gelatin Polymer in Aqueous Solution and Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical fluorogenic gelatin labelling was achieved directly in the aqueous phase using water&#8208;soluble tetraphenylethylene fluorophores via multivalent tetrazolate&#8208;amine electrostatic interactions during macromolecular encapsulation. This strategy allowed the construction of fluorescence&#8208;responsive hydrogel biomaterials exhibiting dynamic behaviors upon salting&#8208;in/out treatments, and enabled high spatio&#8208;temporal imaging of the hydrogel network for biomedical applications.







Abstract
Gelatin polymers made from partially degraded collagen are important biomaterials, but their in&#8208;situ analysis suffers from uncontrollable covalent labelling and poor spatial&#8208;temporal imaging resolution. Herein, three tetrazolate&#8208;tagged tetraphenylethylene fluorophores (TPE&#8722;TAs) are introduced for practical fluorogenic labelling of gelatin in aqueous phase and hydrogels. These probes with aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics offer negligible background and elicit turn&#8208;on fluorescence by simply mixing with the gelatin in aqueous phase, giving a detection limit of 0.15&#8197;mg/L over a linear dynamic range up to 100&#8197;mg/L. This method does not work for collagens and causes minimal interference with gelatin properties. Mechanistic studies reveal a key role for multivalent electrostatic interactions between the abundant basic residues in gelatin (e.&#8201;g., lysine, hydroxylysine, arginine) and anionic tetrazolate moieties of the lipophilic fluorophore synergistically in spatially rigid macromolecular encapsulation to achieve fluorogenic labelling. The AIE strategy by forming non&#8208;covalent fluorophore&#8208;gelatin complexes was developed for novel hydrogels that exhibited reversible fluorescence in response to dynamic microstructural changes in the hydrogel scaffold upon salting&#8208;in/out treatments, and enabled high spatial&#8208;temporal imaging of the fiber network in lyophilized samples. This work may open up avenues for in&#8208;situ imaging analysis and evaluation of gelatin&#8208;based biomaterials during processes such as in&#8197;vivo degradation and mineralization.

The AIE strategy by forming non-covalent fluorophore-gelatin complexes was developed for novel hydrogels that exhibited reversible fluorescence in response to dynamic microstructural changes in the hydrogel scaffold upon salting-in/out treatments, and enabled high spatial-temporal imaging of the fiber network in lyophilized samples. This work may open up avenues for in-situ imaging analysis and evaluation of gelatin-based biomaterials during processes such as in&#8197;vivo degradation and mineralization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Uncatalyzed Diboron Activation by a Strained Hydrocarbon: Experimental and Theoretical Study of [1.1.1]Propellane Diborylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This report reveals that a special apolar hydrocarbon can activate a boron&#8208;boron bond to produce its electrophilic diborylation. Interestingly, this unique reaction occurs with surprising ease within minutes at room temperature, and its detailed mechanistic study has revealed several disruptive features in the context of both propellane and diboron chemistries.







Abstract
The synthesis of strained carbocyclic building blocks is relevant for Medicinal Chemistry, and methylenecyclobutanes are particularly challenging with current synthetic technology. Careful inspection of the reactivity of [1.1.1]propellane and diboron reagents has revealed that bis(catecholato)diboron (B2cat2) can produce a bis(borylated) methylenecyclobutane in a few minutes at room temperature. This reaction constitutes the first example of B&#8722;B bond activation by a special apolar hydrocarbon and also the first time that propellane is electrophilically activated by boron. Mechanistic studies including in&#8197;situ NMR kinetics and DFT calculations demonstrate that the diboron moiety can be directly activated through coordination with the inverted sigma bond of propellane, and reveal that DMF is involved in the stabilization of diboronate ylide intermediates rather than the activation of the B&#8722;B bond. These results enable new possibilities for both diboron and propellane chemistry, and for further developments in the synthesis of methylenecyclobutanes based on propellane strain release.

         <title>Peripheral Fusion of Carbon&#8208;based Aromatic Rings to B4N4&#8208;Heteropentalene Leading to Close &#960;&#8208;Stacking in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#960;&#8208;Electronic molecules with a BN&#8208;heterocyclic and carbon&#8208;based aromatic hybrid ring system (h&#8208;CBN) are interesting in that they potentially exhibit synergistic properties arising from the two different &#960;&#8208;systems. Here we report the synthesis and properties of a h&#8208;CBN&#8208;type molecule (1) having a bicyclic B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene core fused with extended aromatic rings. This molecule exhibits excellent chemical stability despite the absence of bulky substituents for kinetic protection, which in turn provides effective stacking of the &#960;&#8208;system upon crystallization. Depending on the crystallization solvent, 1 forms two polymorphs, i.e., the &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;phases. While both phases have one&#8208;dimensional columnar structures, the &#960;&#8208;stacking geometries associated with the transfer integrals of the frontier orbitals are different, resulting in a twofold difference in the electrical conducting properties. We also found that upon thermal vacuum deposition, 1 gives an amorphous film, which serves as a host material for a red phosphorescent OLED device (maximum external quantum efficiency: 15.5 and 13.3% at 0.1 and 2.5 mA, respectively).</dc:description>

         <title>Complexes of a Frustrated Lewis Pair&#8208;Supported P(&#8211;1) Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several complexes of the intramolecular frustrated Lewis pair (FLP)&#8208;supported P(&#8211;1) ligand [iPr2P(C6H4)BCy2{P}]&#8211; are presented (Cy = cyclohexyl). Chief among these is the first example of a monomeric zinc bis(phosphido) complex, which was synthesized as a potential precursor for the solution&#8208;phase deposition of Zn3P2. While this goal was ultimately unsuccessful, the Zn(II) complex acts as a convenient springboard to other metal phosphide species via transmetallation: namely, a tellurium bis(phosphido) and a formal adduct of the phosphorus subhalide PPCl2. Trapping experiments show that the PPCl2 adduct can also be prepared directly through the in situ reduction of PCl3 in the presence of an intramolecular FLP ligand. Lastly, we report a formal &#951;2&#8208;phosphaborene complex of cobalt(&#8208;1) which is isoelectronic to olefin complexes, and explore its bonding via density functional theory (DFT) computations.</dc:description>

         <title>Research Progress on Ni&#8208;based Electrocatalysts for Electrochemical Reduction of Nitrogen to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical NRR&#160;to synthesize ammonia&#160;is considered as a promising method due to its approvable advantages of zero&#8208;pollution emission, feasible reaction proceedings, good safety and easy management. The multiple efforts have been devoted to the exploration of earth&#8208;abundant&#8208;element&#8208;based nanomaterials as high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for realizing their industrial applications. Among these, the Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials is prioritized as an attractive non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal electrocatalysts for catalyzing NRR because they are earth&#8208;abundance and exceedingly easy to synthesize as well as also delivers the potential of high electrocatalytic activity and durability. In this review, after briefly elucidating the underlying mechanisms of NRR during the electrochemical process, we systematically sum up the recent research progress in representative Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts, including monometallic Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials, bimetallic Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials, polymetallic Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials, etc. In particular, we discuss the effects of physicochemical properties, such as phases, crystallinity, morphology, composition, defects, heteroatom doping, and strain engineering, on the comprehensive performance of the abovementioned electrocatalysts, with the aim of establishing the nanostructure&#8208;function relationships of the electrocatalysts. In addition, the promising directions of Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts for NRR are also pointed out and highlighted. The generic approach in this review may expand the frontiers of NRR and provides the inspiration for developing high&#8208;efficiently Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Bi2Mo3O12: A Dual&#8208;Functional material for electrocatalytic water splitting and supercapacitor applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study explores the functionality of &#945;&#8208;Bi2Mo3O12 (BMO) as an electrocatalyst for water splitting and its suitability for supercapacitor applications. BMO was synthesized by the solvothermal method and characterized in pre&#8208;calcination [BMO (BC)], post&#8208;calcination [BMO (AC)], and base&#8208;etched forms [BMO (BE)]. Structural analysis confirmed the formation of &#945;&#8208;Bi2Mo3O12 with well&#8208;defined crystallographic planes. Electrochemical analysis revealed that BMO (AC) exhibited the lowest overpotential for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and BMO (BC) exhibited the lowest overpotential for oxygen evolution reactions (OER), indicating its superior electrocatalytic activity. The Tafel slope and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results confirmed the superior kinetics and charge transfer properties of BMO material. Furthermore, BMO samples demonstrated excellent stability during prolonged chronoamperometry (CA) testing for 12 h. For supercapacitor performances, the BMO (BE) exhibits a superior specific capacitance value of 398 F/g at 2.0 A/g. Thus, the BMO material delivers prominent electrocatalytic activity as well as supercapacitor performance. Overall, this study demonstrates the potentiality of &#945;&#8208;Bi2Mo3O12 in different forms as a dual&#8208;functional material for efficient energy storage and conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Quantum Coherence of Reversible Photo&#8208;generated Radical and Its Film</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron spin qubits are becoming an important research direction in the field of quantum computing and information storage. However, the quantum decoherence has seriously hindered the development of this field. So far, few qubits exhibit long phase memory time (Tm), and even fewer qubits that can reach room temperature. Some reports show that the coherence times of radicals are generally long, so radicals may be the preferred spin carriers for qubits. Here, we demonstrate the qubit properties of a photogenerated radical (1a) based on 2,4,6&#8208;Tri(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (tpt, 1). More importantly, the photogenerated radical is a spin self&#8208;diluting complex, which the dilution is generally used in the investigation of qubits to reduce the interference of environment on qubits in order to overcome the decoherence of qubits. It is surprised that radical tpt has a stable Tm = 1.1 &#956;s above 20 K, even keep it to room temperature.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electron spin qubits are becoming an important research direction in the field of quantum computing and information storage. However, the quantum decoherence has seriously hindered the development of this field. So far, few qubits exhibit long phase memory time (Tm), and even fewer qubits that can reach room temperature. Some reports show that the coherence times of radicals are generally long, so radicals may be the preferred spin carriers for qubits. Here, we demonstrate the qubit properties of a photogenerated radical (1a) based on 2,4,6-Tri(4-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine (tpt, 1). More importantly, the photogenerated radical is a spin self-diluting complex, which the dilution is generally used in the investigation of qubits to reduce the interference of environment on qubits in order to overcome the decoherence of qubits. It is surprised that radical tpt has a stable Tm = 1.1 &#956;s above 20 K, even keep it to room temperature. In addition, the tpt-film prepared by the vacuum evaporation is significantly increase the T1 and Tm at low temperature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discrete Macrocyclic Polymers Hosts Induced Cascade Luminescence Enhancement and Application in Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integration of polymers, supramolecular macrocycles and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) molecules provides numerous possibilities for constructing various functional supramolecular systems. Herein, we constructed supramolecular assembled systems based on discrete macrocyclic polymer hosts via the cooperation of hydra&#8208;headed macrocycles containing two or three pillar[5]arene units (defined as P2, P3), the block polymer F127 and AIE molecules (alkyl&#8208;cyano modified tetraphenylethene, alkyl&#8208;triazole&#8208;cyano modified 9,10&#8208;distyrylanthracene, defined as TPE&#8208;(CN)4 and DSA&#8208;(TACN)2). Compared with the binary assembly between hydra&#8208;headed hosts or F127 and AIE molecules, cascaded supramolecular assembly&#8208;induced emission enhancement (SAIEE) in aqueous solution was achieved in discrete macrocyclic polymer&#8208;based supramolecular assembled systems. Considering the cascaded SAIEE performance, we have successfully applied discrete macrocyclic polymer&#8208;based supramolecular assembled systems to bioimaging and constructed an artificial light&#8208;harvesting system (LHs) to explore more potential applications. The supramolecular assembly form of discrete macrocyclic polymers hosts and AIE molecules proposed in this work provides new inspiration for the construction and application of high&#8208;performance supramolecular luminescent systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Reduced Surface Area for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Porous Electrode via Electrical Conductivity Relaxation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance of porous electrode is critical for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). However, the effects of gas diffusion on the ORR in porous media need further investigation, although some issues, such as nonthermal surface oxygen exchange, have been attributed to gas diffusion. Herein, La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3&#8208;&#948; (LSCF) with various porosity, pore radii and gas permeability were investigated via the electrical conductivity relaxation method and analysed using the distributed of characteristic time (DCT) model. The ORR is revealed with three characteristic times, which are gas diffusion, oxygen exchange via the surface corresponding to small pores, and oxygen exchange to large pores. Gas diffusion delays the oxygen surface exchange reaction, resulting in very low chemical oxygen surface exchange coefficient compared with that obtained with dense sample under the assumption that all the surfaces are active for the ORR. Reduced surface area is thus defined to quantitatively represent the gas diffusion effects. The reduced surface area increases with increasing gas permeability, demonstrating the importance of electrode engineering for fast gas transport. Moreover, reduced surface area is suggested for replacing the specific surface area to calculate the electrode polarization resistance using the ALS model.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A bio&#8208;inspired FeFe hydrogenase model which catalyses hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic solutions is immobilized in polyaniline (PANI)&#8208;based nanotubes. A combination of analytical techniques reveals that this construct maintains both the molecular signatures of the bio&#8208;inspired complex and the material properties of PANI. The amine and imine&#8208;rich environment of the PANI chain amplifies the inherent HER activity of the bio&#8208;inspired complex, allowing electrocatalytic HER at neutral pH, with lower overpotentials and higher current densities compared to the bio&#8208;inspired complex alone. This construct retains the oxygen stability of the bio&#8208;inspired complex and remains stable through several hours of aerobic electrolysis, producing only 6.5% H2O2 from the competing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).</dc:description>

         <title>Aerobic Oxidation of PMB Ethers to Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With Fe(NO3)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;9H2O and TEMPO as cocatalysts and oxygen as green oxidant, PMB ethers have been converted to carboxylic acids at room temperature with high efficiency and selectivity. Total synthesis of naturally occuring (R)&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;7,9&#8208;octadecadiynoic acid has been realized by applying this protocol as key step. A mechanism involving oxygen&#8208;stabilized benzylic cation has been proposed based on careful studies.







Abstract
The first aerobic protocol of direct transformation of p&#8208;methoxybenzyl (PMB) ethers to carboxylic acids efficiently with Fe(NO3)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;9H2O and TEMPO as catalysts at room temperature has been developed. The reaction accommodates C&#8722;Br bond, terminal/non&#8208;terminal C&#8722;C triple bond, amide, cyano, nitro, ester, and trifluoromethyl groups. Even highly selective oxidative deprotection of different benzylic PMB ethers has been realized. The reaction has been successfully applied to the total synthesis of natural product, (R)&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;7,9&#8208;octadecadiynoic acid, demonstrating the practicality of the method. Based on experimental studies, a possible mechanism involving oxygen&#8208;stabilized benzylic cation has been proposed.

         <title>Pd/C Catalyzed Selective N&#8208;monomethylation by Transfer Hydrogenation of Urea derivatives using Methanol as H2 and C1 Sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;monomethyl amines are useful intermediates in drugs, natural products, paints. Yet their synthesis is a tremendous challenge due to their high reactivity, typically leading to overmethylation. In this contribution, a highly selective catalytic N&#8208;methylation methodology is reported, converting urea derivatives to monomethylated amines, using a commercially available heterogeneous Pd/C catalyst and methanol as unique reagent. Methanol provides a sustainable alternative protocol for the selective preparation of mono&#8208;methylated derivatives as it acts as both H2 and C1 sources. In addition, several control experiments were performed to provide a proposal for the mechanism, namely dehydrogenation of methanol and subsequent hydrogenation of urea derivatives, followed by reduction of the in situ formed methyl imine. Importantly, the approach is simple, highly productive and enables novel synthetic procedures for the preparation of monomethylamines from urea derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Reactivity, and Bonding Analysis of a Tetracoordinated Nickel Carbene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nickel carbenes are key reactive intermediates in the catalytic cyclopropanation of olefins and other reactions, but isolated examples are scarce and generally rely on low coordination numbers (&#8804; 3) to stabilize the metal&#8211;ligand multiple bond. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a stable tetracoordinated nickel carbene bearing a triphosphine pincer ligand. Its nucleophilic character is evidenced by reaction with acids, and it can transfer the carbene fragment to CO to form a ketene. A computational study of the Ni=C chemical bond sheds light on the role of the third phosphine in the pincer framework to the stabilization of the nickel carbene fragment.</dc:description>

         <title>The possible aromatic conjugation via the different edges of (car)borane clusters &#8722; Can the relationship between 3D and 2D aromatic systems be reconciled?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The possible aromatic conjugation between 3D and 2D aromatic units is in the focus since the synthesis of benzocarborane. It has been showed that in the 3D aromatic icosahedral 1,2&#8208;dicarba&#8208;closo&#8208;dodecaborane systems fused with 2D aromatic rings a global 3D/2D aromaticity does not exist. Despite this fact during the last years several studies propose interactions between 2D and 3D moieties. Herein, while tuning the size and the effective charge of the (car)borane systems, we demonstrate that global aromatic character can be excluded in any investigated cases, and the detectable conjugative properties can be explained the effect of the well&#8208;known negative hyperconjugation.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrasonication&#8208;Boosted Resorcinol&#8208;Formaldehyde Resin Nanoparticle Bromine Fixation and Corresponding Upgraded Aquatic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bromine (Br2) and related species removal from water systems are rather complicated due to the complicated chemistry instability, and materials with high Br2 removal rate and efficiency, along with stimuli/apparatus suitable for highly corrosive environments, are necessary. Ultrasonication as a non&#8208;destructive process is especially suitable in scenarios where conventional stir apparatus is not applicable, such as highly corrosive environments. Considering the validity nature of Br2 and combining the advantages of ultrasonic with a highly stable Br2 fixation method through aromatic polymer nanoparticles, we demonstrate highly efficient acoustic&#8208;aided Br2 removal in aqueous solutions with two times capacity compared to the non&#8208;treated sample. Related aquatic applications are also proposed for the materials to be cost&#8208;effective, including silver (Ag) recovery, recyclable MnO2&#8208;mediated Br2 deep removal, and aqueous zinc anode modification. The coupled novel&#8208;material&#8208;based processes motivate the strategic design of water purification with high&#8208;safety and sustainable industrial procedures and post&#8208;value&#8208;added utilizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Coordinate Dinuclear Donor&#8208;Gold(I)&#8208;Acceptor Complexes Exhibiting Multiple Excitation Wavelength Dependent Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;coordinate Au(I) complexes with a donor&#8208;metal&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;M&#8208;A) structure have shown rich luminescent properties. However, charge&#8208;neutral dinuclear donor&#8208;metal&#8208;acceptor type Au(I) complexes featuring aurophilic interactions have been seldom explored. Herein, we describe the structures and photoluminescence properties of two dinuclear Au(I) complexes, namely DiAu&#8208;Ph and DiAu&#8208;Me. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis of DiAu&#8208;Ph reveals a short intramolecular Au&#8208;Au distance of 3.224 &#197;. In dilute solution and doped films, excitation wavelength dependent multiple phosphorescence phenomena were observed for these dinuclear complexes. Theoretical calculations reveal that the aurophilic interaction causes increased contribution of the Au d orbital to the highest occupied molecular orbitals. Thus, the gap between singlet and triplet excited states (&#916;EST) is enlarged, which disables the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Moreover, the large energy separation (0.45&#8208;0.52 eV) and the different orbital configurations between the various excited states result in an inefficient internal conversion, accounting for their multiple phosphorescence properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Janus Reactivity of Crownphyrinoids: Alkali&#8208; vs. Transition Metal&#8208;Mediated Transformations of Crown Ether&#8208;Porphyrin Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crownphyrinogens and crownphyrins constitute a group of macrocycles that combine the structural facets of porphyrinoids and crown ethers. The dual&#8208;nature cavity embedded in their molecules enables reactivity involving two structurally distinct parts of the macrocyclic ligand. Upon Ni(II) and Pd(II) insertion, coordination compounds are produced wherein the metal is incorporated into the porphyrinoid&#8208;like pocket, resulting in monomeric or accordion&#8208;like dimeric products, depending on the oxidation level of the macrocycle and metal cation. The reactions with Na(I) and K(I) resulted in the formation of complexes where only the crown ether segment of the molecule is involved in metal binding, yielding remarkable dimeric species. The exploitation of a crownphyrin large enough to accommodate two metal cations allowed the synthesis of an alkali/transition metal binuclear complexes wherein the macrocycle demonstrated the Janus reactivity with one cavity acting as a porphyrinoid, and the other mimicking the crown ether.</dc:description>

         <title>Photomediated Hexafluoroisopropoxylation of Unactivated Aryl Halides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of fluoroalkoxy groups, such as trifluoromethoxy and 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethoxy groups, in pharmaceutical and agrochemical development has increased dramatically in recent years. However, hexafluoroisopropoxy groups have remained significantly underrepresented, presumably due to limited synthetic methods for accessing this substituent in good yields. Herein, we report a mild, photochemical nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) approach for the synthesis of hexafluoroisopropyl aryl ethers from unactivated and abundant aryl halides. Notably, aryl chloride and bromide functionality are efficiently engaged by this methodology in addition to the traditional aryl fluoride nucleofuge. This method provided access to a diverse array of hexafluoroisopropyl aryl ethers, including multiple examples of late&#8208;stage functionalization of active pharmaceutical ingredients. A simple flow system was adapted for 10x scale&#8208;up, maintaining good yield for the reaction. Initial mechanistic studies indicate single electron oxidation of the arene as a key step in product formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving Regioselectivity for Remote C&#8211;H Activation by Substructure Conformations: an Approach of Paralogous Cytochrome P450 Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For advanced synthetic intermediates or natural products with multiple unactivated and energetically similar C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, controlling regioselectivity for the C&#8208;H activation is particularly challenging. The use of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) is a promising solution to the &#8216;regioelectivity&#8217; challenge in remote C&#8211;H activation. Notably, CYPs and organic catalysts share a fundamental principle: they strive to control the distance and geometry between the metal reaction center and the target C&#8208;H site. Most structural analyses of the regioselectivity of CYPs are limited to the active pocket, particularly when explaining why regioselectivity could be altered by enzyme engineering through mutagenesis. However, the substructures responsible for forming the active pocket in CYPs are well known to display complex dynamic changes and substrate&#8208;induced plasticity. In this context, we highlight a comparative study of the recently reported paralogous CYPs, IkaD and CftA, which achieve different regioselectivity towards the same substrate ikarugamycin by distinct substructure conformations. We propose that substructural conformation&#8208;controlled regioselectivity might also be present in CYPs of other natural product biosynthesis pathways, which should be considered when engineering CYPs for regioselective modifications.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heteroocyclic Carbenes and N&#8208;Heterocycles as Synthetic Reagents and Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have become important tools in modern synthetic chemistry due to their versatility as organocatalysts and ligands in organometallic complexes. Since their first isolation and characterization, NHCs have demonstrated significant utility in various catalytic processes, offering advantages such as strong &#963;&#8208;electron donation and the ability to stabilize reactive intermediates. However, beyond their well&#8208;documented roles in catalysis, the potential of NHCs as stoichiometric reagents and synthetic building blocks remains an underexplored yet promising area. This Mini&#8208;review aims to shed light on these lesser&#8208;known applications of NHCs and their N&#8208;heterocyclic precursors or derivatives in organic synthesis. Furthermore, we discuss how the unique electronic and steric properties of NHCs can be harnessed to develop new synthetic methodologies or construct interesting organic frameworks. By highlighting these emerging uses, we hope to encourage further research into the non&#8208;catalytic applications of NHCs, broadening their scope and impact in synthetic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Introduction of Molecular Complexity via the Cross&#8208;Coupling of Lithium 1,4&#8208;Dioxene with Aryl Bromides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthetic potential of substituted 1,4&#8208;dioxenes is well recognised, although the chemistry of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dioxenes is relatively unexplored. Their transition metal&#8208;catalysed synthesis has been limited to Stille&#8208;type cross&#8208;coupling chemistry, typically showing long reaction times, or proceeding at high reaction temperatures. Here we present a facile and general methodology for the cross&#8208;coupling of aryl bromides with lithium 1,4&#8208;dioxene, affording a range of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dioxenes in generally good yields. We highlight the synthetic applicability of this transformation at multigram scale, and demonstrate the versatility of the products by conversion of the dioxene units to various carbonyl&#8208;based functionalities. Additionally, we present a concise two&#8208;step synthesis of an arylated analogue to a known 1,4&#8208;dioxene&#8208;based antifungal agent.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydroflux Synthesis and Structural Phase Transition of Rare&#8208;Earth Borate Hydroxides Na2[RE(BO3)(OH)2] (RE = Y, Gd&#8211;Er)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reacting RE2O3 and H3BO3 in an ultra&#8208;alkaline NaOH hydroflux at about 250 &#176;C yielded pure, crystalline samples of Na2[RE(BO3)(OH)2] (RE = Y, Gd&#8211;Er). The compounds dehydrate to Na3RE(BO3)2 upon heating in air to about 500 &#176;C. Na2[RE(BO3)(OH)2] (RE = Tb&#8211;Er) are photoluminescent under UV radiation. Their UV&#8208;Vis spectra show the typical absorptions associated with 4f&#8208;4f transitions and absorption edges in the UV (band gaps &#8805; 5.7 eV). The RE3+ cation is coordinated by seven oxygen atoms, which define a distorted pentagonal bipyramid. The bipyramids share trans&#8208;edges of their base forming infinite chains. Triangular (BO3)3&#8211; groups connect the chains into layers. The crystal structure of Na2[Ho(BO3)(OH)2] was investigated at various temperatures in the range 100 K &#8804; T &#8804; 320 K. Above 310(2) K, the compound crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Cmcm (&#946;&#8208;phase), below, it undergoes a displacive phase transition of second order resulting in a monoclinic structure in space group C2/c (&#945;&#8208;phase). The critical exponents derived from different structural parameters indicate a cooperative distortion of the borate layers, but a rather uncorrelated adaptation of the sodium cations to their local environment. The other compounds of the series also adopt the structure of the &#945;&#8208;phase at 296 K.</dc:description>

         <title>ZnH2P4N8: Case Study on Topochemical Imidonitridophosphate High&#8208;Pressure Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitridophosphates are subject of current research, as they have a broad spectrum of properties and potential applications, such as ion conductors or luminescent materials. Yet, the subclass of imidonitridophosphates has been studied less extensively. The primary reason is that the controlled N&#8211;H functionalization of nitridophosphates is not straight forward, making targeted synthesis more challenging. Inspired by the high&#8208;pressure (HP) post&#8208;synthetic modification of nitridophosphates, we present the topochemical HP deprotonation of phosphorus nitride imides using the high&#8208;pressure polymorph &#946;&#8208;PN(NH) as an example. Additional incorporation of Zn2+ results in the first quaternary transition metal imidonitridophosphate ZnH2P4N8.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nitridophosphates are subject of current research, as they have a broad spectrum of properties and potential applications, such as ion conductors or luminescent materials. Yet, the subclass of imidonitridophosphates has been studied less extensively. The primary reason is that the controlled N&#8211;H functionalization of nitridophosphates is not straight forward, making targeted synthesis more challenging. Inspired by the high-pressure (HP) post-synthetic modification of nitridophosphates, we present the topochemical HP deprotonation of phosphorus nitride imides using the high-pressure polymorph &#946;-PN(NH) as an example. Additional incorporation of Zn2+ results in the first quaternary transition metal imidonitridophosphate ZnH2P4N8. The crystal structure was elucidated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and solid-state magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MAS NMR). In addition, the presence of H as part of an imide group was confirmed by IR spectroscopy. The potential of this defunctionalization approach for controlling the N&#8211;H content is demonstrated by the preparation of partially deprotonated intermediates ZnxH4&#8722;2xP4N8 (x&#160;&#8776;&#160; 0.5, 0.85).

         <title>Development of Natural&#8208;Product&#8208;Inspired ABCB1 Inhibitors Through Regioselective Tryptophan C3&#8208;Benzylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emergence of drug resistance in cancer&#160;is a serious threat. Upregulation of&#160;ABC/P&#8208;gp&#160;transporters significantly contributes to this&#160;emergence.&#160;Despite&#160;30 years of efforts,&#160;the search for effective ABC/P&#8208;gp inhibitors with&#160;minimal&#160;toxicity to human cells, is&#160;still underway.&#160;Inspired by Nocardioazine A, a marine alkaloid that inhibits&#160;P&#8208;gp, we report a regioselective pathway to create&#160;indole&#8208;C3&#8208;benzyl cyclo&#8208;L&#8208;Trp&#8208;L&#8208;Trp DKPs. We have reported that&#160;exo&#8208;C3&#8208;N&#8208;Dbn&#173;&#8208;Trp2 (13) as a lead ABCB1 inhibitor that is more effective than Verapamil. C3N&#8208;Dbn&#8208;Trp2 restored chemotherapy sensitivity in drug&#8208;resistant human cancer cells and had no adverse effect on cell proliferation.&#160;Herein, we report several such&#160;C3&#8208;functionalized pyrroloindolines as ABCB1 inhibitors.&#160;Results arising from the molecular docking studies indicate that the interactions at the access tunnel between ABCB1 and the inhibitor result in a powerful predictor for the efficacy of the inhibitor. Based on fluorescence&#8208;based assays, we conclude that the most efficacious inhibitor is the p&#8208;cyano&#8208;derived exo&#8208;C3&#8208;N&#8208;Dbn&#173;&#8208;Trp2 (33a), closely followed by several analogues. We correlate that the predictions based on the inhibitor interactions at the access tunnel provide clues about the design of improved ABCB1 inhibitors. This work lays the foundation for the design of a new class of inhibitors from a&#160;cyclo&#8208;L&#8208;Trp&#8208;L&#8208;Trp DKP scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>Columnar Organization of Nonalternant Fluorinated Dehydrobenzannulenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two new partially fluorinated dehydrobenzannulenes have been prepared by inter&#8208; and intramolecular oxidative homocoupling of diyne precursors. These systems contain fluorinated and nonfluorinated arene rings in a non&#8208;alternant arrangement. Both macrocycles are roughly planar and organize into extended columns in the solid state. The assembly of these columns is mediated by the combination of dispersion interactions, slipped [&#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;] stacking interactions of the perfluorinated rings with each other, and their association with the nonfluorinated rings in the molecules of the neighboring macrocycles. These results suggest that partial fluorination of dehydrobenzannulenes can serve as a versatile motif for their assembly into columnar superstructures.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Amphiphilic Au23 Cluster and Its Specific Recognition to Remote Di&#8208;amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The atomic precision of metal nanoclusters and variability of surface ligands pave the way for its rational design and functionalization, whereas the property strengthening in multiple ways has been long challenging. Herein, improved amphiphilicity, chirality, thermostability, and strong CPL (circularly polarized luminescence) properties have been accomplished by facile ligand exchange of [Au23(CHT)16]&#8208; with HCapt (HCHT and HCapt denote cyclohexanethiol and captopril). In addition, the obtained chiral [Au23(SR)16]&#8208; (short for [Au23(CHT)16&#8208;x(Capt)x]&#8208;) clusters show specific binding affinity to remote&#8208;diamines (such as arginine and single/double strand DNA), originating from the hydrogen bonding and Van der Walls interaction among the surface Capt ligands and the di&#8208;amine groups.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Electrolyte for Electrosynthesis: Scalable Anodically&#8208;Enabled One&#8208;Pot Sequence from Aldehyde to Isoxazol(in)es</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical transformations are considered a green alternative to classical redox chemistry as it eliminates the necessity for toxic and waste producing redox reagents. Typical electrochemical reactions require the addition of a so&#8208;called supporting electrolyte &#8208; a salt bridge &#8211; and other additives, such as hexafluorisopropanol, to enhance conductivity and reaction outcomes, respectively. However, this is often accompanied by an increase in the amount of produced waste. Here, we report an "in&#8208;situ electrolyte" concept for facile, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, additive&#8208;free one&#8208;pot electrochemical preparation of isoxazol(in)es, important scaffolds for biologically active natural and synthetic molecules, from the respective aldehydes. The protocol utilizes no halogenated solvents and no external oxidants, while salt side&#8208;products provide the ionic conductivity necessary for the electrosynthesis. The electrolysis is performed in an undivided cell, using the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrodes for the chlor&#8208;alkali industry dimensionally stable and scalable mixed metal oxide anode and platinized titanium anode of high durability. The cascade transformation comprises the condensation of aldehyde to oxime followed by its anodic oxidation and subsequent intra&#8208; and/or intermolecular [3+2] cycloadditions with an appropriate dipolarophile. Chemical yields up to 97%, and good Faradaic efficiency, scalability, and stability are observed for most substrates in a broad scope.</dc:description>

         <title>Assay for characterizing adsorption&#8208;properties of surfaces (APS)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Analytes, from sample preparation, until entering an analytical instrument, are prone to adsorb to surfaces, driven by the chemical properties of the surface and the liquids they are dissolved in. This problem can be addressed with internal standards when a single or few known analytes are quantified that are usually not available in omics. However, minimal to no loss of analytes is the aim. Here, we present a novel assay for qualifying and quantifying interactions responsible for adsorption of molecules to surfaces (APS) by using LC&#8208;MS/MS&#8208;based differential quantitative analysis. To reflect a broad range of chemical interactions with surfaces, a reference mixture of thousands of tryptic peptides, with known compositions was selected, representing a variety of different chemical characteristics. The assay was tested by investigating the adsorption properties of several different vials with different surface chemistries. A significant number of hydrophobic peptides adsorbed to conventional polypropylene vials. In contrast, only few peptides adsorbed to polypropylene vials, assigned as low&#8208;protein&#8208;binding. The highest number of peptides adsorbed to glass vials driven by electrostatic interactions. In summary, the new assay is suitable to characterize adsorption properties of different surfaces and to approximate the loss of analytes during sample preparation.</dc:description>

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Metabolic Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy of Pancreatic and Colon Cancer Tumor&#8208;Xenografts with Parahydrogen Hyperpolarized 1&#8208;13C Pyruvate&#8208;d3</title>

         <dc:description>
1&#8208;13C&#8208;pyruvate&#8208;d3 hyperpolarized via parahydrogen can be used to study altered metabolism with MRI in pancreatic as well as colon cancer human tumor&#8208;xenografts.







Abstract
Parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization (PHIP) is an emerging technique to enhance the signal of stable isotope metabolic contrast agents for Magnetic Resonance (MR). The objective of this study is to continue establishing 1&#8208;13C&#8208;pyruvate&#8208;d3, signal&#8208;enhanced via PHIP, as a hyperpolarized contrast agent, obtained in seconds, to monitor metabolism in human cancer. Our focus was on human pancreatic and colon tumor xenografts. 1&#8208;13C&#8208;vinylpyruvate&#8208;d6 was hydrogenated using parahydrogen. Thereafter, the polarization of the protons was transferred to 13C. Following a workup procedure, the free hyperpolarized 1&#8208;13C&#8208;pyruvate&#8208;d3 was obtained in clean aqueous solution. After injection into animals bearing either pancreatic or colon cancer xenografts, slice&#8208;selective MR spectra were acquired and analyzed to determine rate constants of metabolic conversion into lactate and alanine. 1&#8208;13C&#8208;pyruvate&#8208;d3 proved to follow the increased metabolic rate to lactate and alanine in the tumor xenografts.

         <title>Elevating Oxygen Evolution using Iron Phthalocyanine Infused Vanillic acid Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The designing of transition metal based organic catalyst plays an important role in water oxidation to produce oxygen. The present work involves the fabrication of iron based phthalocyanine catalyst on Ni foam which exhibited higher oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with lower overpotential compared to standard IrO2&#8901; It emphasizes the role of bimetallic Fe and Ni catalyst in the enhancement of OER activity.







Abstract
Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the bottle neck step in water splitting reaction towards the realization of hydrogen based clean energy production and storage. Metal air batteries and polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) are the alternative green energy systems that utilise O2 and H2 in the production of continuous and high energy output without the utilization of carbon based fuels which are the major sources of pollution. Transition metal based N4 organics are explored extensively as oxygen electrocatalysts i.&#8201;e., OER and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts because of their ease of synthesis, tuneable properties, low cost and high performance with long term stability. Here, vanillic acid functionalized iron phthalocyanine (FeVAPc) was synthesised and characterised by various spectroscopic techniques. The novel FeVAPc exhibited good thermal stability and was coated on Ni foam for OER studies. The scanning electron microscopy images showed net&#8208;work like surface morphology and the X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated the presence of Fe in +3 oxidation state. The Ni/FeVAPc demonstrated excellent electrocatalytic activity for OER with overpotential of 312&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA.cm&#8722;2 current density in 1.0&#8197;M KOH electrolyte. The designed organic based catalyst exhibited lesser Tafel slope value which is nearer to the benchmark catalyst, IrO2. The proposed catalyst exhibited good stability as phthalocyanines are highly stable and do not undergo decomposition even in strong acidic and basic corrosive media. Integration of FeVAPc onto the Ni foam resulted in higher mass activity, lower charge transfer resistance, high active surface area leading to enhanced conductivity and activity. The fabricated Ni/FeVAPc is an appropriate cost&#8208;effective, efficient and stable catalyst for OER towards industrial applications.

         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced cascade reaction was developed for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of 6&#8208;hydroxyindoloquinazolinones using isatins (or isatins and isatoic anhydrides) and aliphatic carboxylic acids, without the need for any catalysts/oxidants/metals. This method is applicable to various aliphatic carboxylic acids, yielding 36 sterically diverse products in 33&#8211;96&#8201;% yields.

         <title>Electrostatic Surface Potentials and Chalcogen&#8208;Bonding Motifs of Substituted 2,1,3&#8208;Benzoselenadiazoles Probed via 77Se Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of substituents on the self&#8208;complementary chalcogen bonding of 2,1,3&#8208;benzoselenadiazoles is investigated through solid&#8208;state and computational methods. 77Se solid&#8208;state NMR is found to be a sensitive probe of molecular surface potentials and chalcogen bond motifs.







Abstract
Chalcogen bonds (ChB) are moderately strong, directional, and specific non&#8208;covalent interactions that have garnered substantial interest over the last decades. Specifically, the presence of two &#963;&#8208;holes offers great potential for crystal engineering, catalysis, biochemistry, and molecular sensing. However, ChB applications are currently hampered by a lack of methods to characterize and control chalcogen bonds. Here, we report on the influence of various substituents (halogens, cyano, and methyl groups) on the observed self&#8208;complementary ChB networks of 2,1,3&#8208;benzoselenadiazoles. From molecular electrostatic potential calculations, we show that the electrostatic surface potentials (ESP) of the &#963;&#8208;holes on selenium are largely influenced by the electron&#8208;withdrawing character of these substituents. Structural analyses via X&#8208;ray diffraction reveal a variety of ChB geometries and binding modes that are rationalized via the computed ESP maps, although the structure of 5,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,1,3&#8208;benzoselenadiazole also demonstrates the influence of steric interactions. 77Se solid&#8208;state magic&#8208;angle spinning NMR spectroscopy, in particular the analysis of the selenium chemical shift tensors, is found to be an effective probe able to characterize both structural and electrostatic features of these self&#8208;complementary ChB systems. We find a positive correlation between the value of the ESP maxima at the &#963;&#8208;holes and the experimentally measured 77Se isotropic chemical shift, while the skew of the chemical shift tensor is established as a metric which is reflective of the ChB binding motif.

         <title>Photochemical Initiation and Reactions of Thiyl Radicals Studied with SH2&#8217; Radical Traps</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SH2&#8217;&#8208;based radical traps were used to probe the mechanisms of photochemical spirocyclisation of indole&#8208;ynones with thiols and a relate thiol&#8208;ene reaction. The observation of trapped initiator radicals by electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) was consistent with the proposed formation of an intramolecular electron donor&#8208;acceptor indole&#8208;ynone complex. Trends in MS intensity of trapped intermediate radicals were rationalised in terms of radical reactivity.







Abstract
A radical trapping method based on an SH2&#8217; homolytic substitution reaction was applied to study the mechanism of a photochemical spirocyclisation of indole&#8208;ynones in the presence of thiols. Starting material, products and a range of trapped radical intermediates were simultaneously detected in reaction mixtures by mass spectrometry (MS). The trapped intermediates included both initiating and main chain propagating radicals. These data made it possible to propose a self&#8208;initiation mechanism consistent with the originally postulated photoexcitation of an intramolecular electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex of the substrate. The effect of thiol structure on the MS peak intensity of the reaction components was rationalised in terms of the relative stability of the radical intermediates. The results were compared to a simpler related reaction, a photochemical thiol&#8208;ene addition where reagents, products and trapped intermediate radicals were also detected by MS. Relative MS peak intensities were again explained by a combination of electronic and steric effects on the stability of intermediate radicals. Overall, SH2&#8217; radical trapping was demonstrated to be a powerful experimental technique for providing mechanistic evidence on photochemical and other organic radical reactions.

         <title>Gas Delivery Relevant to Human Health using Porous Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gases are essential for various applications relevant to human health and medicine. This Perspective aims to review the use of porous materials for the delivery of medicinally relevant gases including hydrogen sulfide, xenon, oxygen, and various gases for organic synthesis and to highlight the advantages of these solid&#8208;state systems over traditional methods of gas storage and delivery.







Abstract
Gases are essential for various applications relevant to human health, including in medicine, biomedical imaging, and pharmaceutical synthesis. However, gases are significantly more challenging to safely handle than liquids and solids. Herein, we review the use of porous materials, such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), zeolites, and silicas, to adsorb medicinally relevant gases and facilitate their handling as solids. Specific topics include the use of MOFs and zeolites to deliver H2S for therapeutic applications, 129Xe for magnetic resonance imaging, O2 for the treatment of cancer and hypoxia, and various gases for use in organic synthesis. This Perspective aims to bring together the organic, inorganic, medicinal, and materials chemistry communities to inspire the design of next&#8208;generation porous materials for the storage and delivery of medicinally relevant gases.

         <title>Enhanced Photocatalytic Ozonation Using Modified TiO2 With Designed Nucleophilic and Electrophilic Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface hydroxyl groups greatly promote O3 adsorption due to the presence of nucleophilic O&#8208;sites and electrophilic H&#8208;sites. At the same time, the surface hydroxyl groups lead to the internal polarization of the surface&#8208;adsorbed O3 and enhanced separation of photogenerated charge carriers, both of which are beneficial to promote O3 activation and ROS formation. Therefore, TiO2&#8722;OH displays efficiently photocatalytic ozonation. Notably, TiO2&#8722;OH mineralization efficiency in pharmaceutical plant wastewater is as high as 97.6&#8201;% within 7&#8197;hours.







Abstract
Photocatalytic ozonation is considered to be a promising approach for the treatment of refractory organic pollutants, but the design of efficient catalyst remains a challenge. Surface modification provides a potential strategy to improve the activity of photocatalytic ozonation. In this work, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were first performed to check the interaction between O3 and TiO2&#8722;OH (surface hydroxylated TiO2) or TiO2&#8722;F (surface fluorinated TiO2), and the results suggest that TiO2&#8722;OH displays better O3 adsorption and activation than does TiO2&#8722;F, which is confirmed by experimental results. The surface hydroxyl groups greatly promote the O3 activation, which is beneficial for the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Importantly, TiO2&#8722;OH displays better performance towards pollutants (such as berberine hydrochloride) removal than does TiO2&#8722;F and most reported ozonation photocatalysts. The total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiency reaches 84.4&#8201;% within two hours. This work highlights the effect of surface hydroxylation on photocatalytic ozonation and provides ideas for the design of efficient photocatalytic ozonation catalysts.

         <title>Design and Realization of Visual and Contact&#8208;Type Fast Charging Power Source</title>

Different with the charging method of conventional batteries, charging is achieved by a Zn sheet contacting with a WO3 film moistened with water, resulting in a rapid discoloration of WO3, and the open&#8208;circuit voltage of the device is 0.7&#8197;V, which can be used to drive various electronics by series&#8208;parallel connection.







Abstract
Charging power supplies with both fast and visualization functions have a wide range of applications in the information and new energy industries. In this paper, the visualized and contact&#8208;type fast charging power supply based on WO3 film and Zn sheet is presented, and the prototype devices are fabricated. Different with the charging method of conventional batteries, charging is achieved by a Zn sheet contacting with a WO3 film moistened with water, resulting in a rapid discoloration of WO3. Theoretical investigation indicates that the interaction between Zn sheet and water molecules is the primary cause of the color change in the WO3 film. The WO3 film completes the colouring state within 10&#8197;s in the presence of Zn sheet and water, and the open&#8208;circuit voltage of the device is 0.7&#8197;V, which can be used to drive various electronics by series&#8208;parallel connection. This research introduces a novel method to induce colouring of WO3 films and proposes a fast charging mode different from traditional power sources. It provides valuable insights for the future development of fast charging in the field of electrical energy.

         <title>Elucidating Mechanism and Selectivity in Pyridine Functionalization Through Silylium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that a semi&#8208;enclosed &#8242;rigid&#8217; electronegative cavity in PADI&#8208;type anions creates a well&#8208;defined recognition site, facilitating interaction with positively charged silylium pyridine species. Due to the high electrophilicity and minimal steric demand at the C4&#8208;position of the pyridine substrate, the reaction predominantly produces a C4&#8208;regioselective product.







Abstract
The functionalization of aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles through silylium activation demonstrates exceptional selectivity and efficiency. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations unveil the detailed silylium catalysis mechanism and elucidate the origins of selectivity in this reaction. The phosphoramidimidate sulfonamide (PADI) precatalyst orchestrates of the catalytic cycle via three elementary steps. The Br&#248;nsted acidity of precatalyst significantly influences both the formation of silylium&#8208;based Lewis acid active species and the silylium activation of pyridine. Unlike disulfonimide (DSI)&#8208;type precatalysts, both Tf2NH and PADI precatalysts with strong acidities can easily promote the generation of activated silylium pyridine species. A semi&#8208;enclosed &#8242;rigid&#8217; electronegative cavity in PADI&#8208;type anions constructs a well&#8208;defined recognition site, facilitating engagement with the positively charged silylium pyridine species. Due to the high electrophilicity and less steric demand at the C4&#8208;position of the pyridine substrate, the product with C4&#8208;regioselectivity was predominantly generated.

         <title>Radical C&#8208;Glycosylation Using Photoexcitable Unprotected Glycosyl Borate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed radical C&#8208;glycosylation using photoexcitable unprotected glycosyl borate. The direct excitation of glycosyl borate under visible light irradiation enabled the generation of anomeric radical without any photoredox catalysts. The in&#8197;situ generated anomeric radical was applicable to the radical addition such as Giese&#8208;type addition and Minisci&#8208;type reaction to introduce alkyl and heteroaryl groups at the anomeric position. In addition, the radical&#8211;radical coupling between the glycosyl borate and acyl imidazolide provided unprotected acyl C&#8208;glycoside.

         <title>Novel Benzothiadiazole&#8208;based Donor&#8208;Acceptor Systems: Synthesis, Ultrafast Charge Transfer and Separation Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of benzothiadiazole&#8208;based donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores with multiple donor/acceptor entities of variable electronic strengths has been designed, synthesized, and unveiled their explicit photo&#8208;electro&#8208;chemical responses for the first time. Facile intramolecular charge transfer, subsequent charge separation, and broad absorption expand their horizons in advanced optical and photonic applications.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorbing electron donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) chromophores have been at the forefront of current energy research owing to their facile charge transfer (CT) characteristics, which are primitive for photovoltaic applications. Herein, we have designed and developed a new set of benzothiadiazole (BTD)&#8208;based tetracyanobutadiene (TCBD)/dicyanoquinodimethane (DCNQ)&#8208;embedded multimodular D&#8722;A systems (BTD1&#8208;BTD6) and investigated their inherent photo&#8208;electro&#8208;chemical responses for the first time having identical and mixed terminal donors of variable donicity. Apart from poor luminescence, the appearance of broad low&#8208;lying optical transitions extendable even in the NIR region (&gt;1000&#8197;nm), particularly in the presence of the auxiliary acceptors, are indicative of underlying nonradiative excited state processes leading to robust intramolecular CT and subsequent charge separation (CS) processes in these D&#8722;A constructs. While electrochemical studies identify the moieties involved in these photo&#8208;events, orbital delocalization and consequent evidence for the low&#8208;energy CT transitions have been achieved from theoretical calculations. Finally, the spectral and temporal responses of different photoproducts are obtained from femtosecond transient absorption studies, which, coupled with spectroelectrochemical data, identify broad NIR signals as CS states of the compounds. All the systems are found to be susceptible to ultrafast (~ps) CT and CS before carrier recombination to the ground state, which is, however, significantly facilitated after incorporation of the secondary TCBD/DCNQ acceptors, leading to faster and thus efficient CT processes, particularly in polar solvents. These findings, including facile CT/CS and broad and intense panchromatic absorption over a wide window of the electromagnetic spectrum, are likely to expand the horizons of BTD&#8208;based multimodular CT systems to revolutionize the realm of solar energy conversion and associated photonic applications.

         <title>A Facile Approach to Construct Novel Polyesters as Soft Midblock for Thermoplastic Elastomers</title>

         <dc:description>
A facile synthetic strategy was developed to prepare a class of CL&#8208;based monomers (R&#8208;TO) with a variety of functionalities and well&#8208;defined stereochemistry by exploit of epoxides, which readily polymerize via well&#8208;controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) to afford a series of amorphous polyesters P(R&#8208;TO). Sequential addition copolymerization of MTO and L&#8208;lactide (L&#8208;LA) allowed to access of a series of ABA triblock copolymers with composition&#8208;dependent mechanical properties.







Abstract
The development of innovative synthetic strategies to create functional polycaprolactones is highly demanded for advanced material applications. In this contribution, we reported a facile synthetic strategy to prepare a class of CL&#8208;based monomers (R&#8208;TO) derived from epoxides. They readily polymerize via well&#8208;controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) to afford a series of polyesters P(R&#8208;TO) with high molecular weight (Mn up to 350&#8197;kDa). Sequential addition copolymerization of MTO and L&#8208;lactide (L&#8208;LA) allowed to access of a series of ABA triblock copolymers with composition&#8208;dependent mechanical properties. Notably, P(L&#8208;LA)100&#8208;b&#8208;P(MTO)500&#8208;b&#8208;P(L&#8208;LA)100 containing the amorphous P(MTO) segment as a soft midblock and crystalline P(L&#8208;LA) domain as hard end block behaved as an excellent thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) with high elongation at break (1438&#177;204&#8201;%), tensile strength (23.5&#177;1.7&#8197;MPa), and outstanding elastic recovery (&gt;88&#8201;%).

&lt;p&gt;The development of innovative synthetic strategies to create functional polycaprolactones is highly demanded for advanced material applications. In this contribution, we reported a facile synthetic strategy to prepare a class of CL-based monomers (R-TO) derived from epoxides. They readily polymerize via well-controlled ring-opening polymerization (ROP) to afford a series of polyesters P(R-TO) with high molecular weight (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; up to 350&#8197;kDa). Sequential addition copolymerization of MTO and &lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;-lactide (&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;-LA) allowed to access of a series of ABA triblock copolymers with composition-dependent mechanical properties. Notably, P(&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;-LA)&lt;sub&gt;100&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-P(MTO)&lt;sub&gt;500&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-P(&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;-LA)&lt;sub&gt;100&lt;/sub&gt; containing the amorphous P(MTO) segment as a soft midblock and crystalline P(&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;-LA) domain as hard end block behaved as an excellent thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) with high elongation at break (1438&#177;204&#8201;%), tensile strength (23.5&#177;1.7&#8197;MPa), and outstanding elastic recovery (&amp;gt;88&#8201;%).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lead Bromide Complex in Tri&#8208;n&#8208;Octylphosphine Oxide Matrix with Bright Photoluminance and Exceptional Thermoplasticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal halide materials, known for their opto&#8208;electronic properties and structural diversity, face challenges due to rigidity, making them brittle and difficult to shape. We introduce a thermoplastic hybrid lead halide solid, formed by integrating lead bromide complex into a TOPO matrix. This enables near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature melt&#8208;processing, offering potential for self&#8208;healing fluorescent inks.







Abstract
Metal halide materials have recently drawn increasing research interest for their excellent opto&#8208;electronic properties and structural diversity, but their resulting rigid structures render them brittle and poor formability during manufacturing. Here we demonstrate a thermoplastic luminant hybrid lead halide solid by integrating lead bromide complex into tri&#8208;n&#8208;octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) matrix. The construction of the hybrid materials can be achieved by a simple dissolution process, in which TOPO molecules act as the solvents and ligands to yield the monodispersed clusters. The combination of these functional units enables the near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature melt&#8208;processing of the materials into targeted geometry by simple molding or printing techniques, which offer possibilities for fluorescent writing inks with outstanding self&#8208;healing capacity to physical damage. The intermarriage between metal halide clusters with functional molecules expands the range of practical applications for hybrid metal halide materials.

         <title>Intramolecular Nucleophilic Vinylic Substitution (SNV) by Carbon Nucleophiles: Conformationally Directed Formation of Dienes from N,N&#8217;&#8208;Diallyl Ureas</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diallyl ureas, on treatment with base, undergo a cascade of reversible deprotonations and alkene isomerisations that culminate in an intramolecular SNV reaction that links the two allylic substituents together to form a diene.







Abstract
Nucleophilic vinylic substitution (SNV) by carbon nucleophiles allows the formation of vinylic C&#8722;C bonds without transition metal catalysts. In this paper, we show that tethering two alkenes together through a urea linkage can lead to the formation of a diene by an intramolecular SNV reaction. The starting materials are fully substituted N,N&#8217;&#8208;diallyl ureas; the reaction proceeds in the presence of base, and entails a cascade of deprotonations, reprotonations, and an SNV reaction of an allylic carbanion on a rare electrophile: a vinylic urea. As a result, two allylic substituents couple to form a diene, despite the fact that neither is activated towards electrophilic attack. The reaction is tolerant of significant steric bulk, and exhibits regioselectivity with unsymmetrical diallyl ureas: &#946;&#8208;substituted allyl groups invariably behave as nucleophiles, while electrophilic behavior may be enforced by the use of an E&#8208;vinylic urea substituent that cannot be deprotonated under the reaction conditions.

         <title>Triphenylamine Sensitized 8&#8208;Dimethylaminoquinoline: An Efficient Two&#8208;Photon Caging Group for Intracellular Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How to select a few cells from a culture and modify them with a probe? Triphenylamine&#8208;sensitized 8&#8208;DMAQ (TAQ) probes showed internalization in HeLa cells that could be consecutively activated either by using UV light source (357&#8197;nm) or, under two&#8208;photon irradiation conditions (760&#8197;nm). Activation allowed to efficient release of the reporter into cells in light&#8208;exposed regions.







Abstract
Triphenylamine&#8208;sensitized 8&#8208;dimethylaminoquinoline (TAQ) probes showed fair two&#8208;photon absorption and fragmentation cross sections in releasing kainate and GABA ligands. The water&#8208;soluble PEG and TEG&#8208;analogs allowed cell internalization and efficient light&#8208;gated liberation of the rhodamine reporter under UV and two&#8208;photon (NIR) irradiation conditions.

         <title>Dimers and 2D Networks of Adamantane&#8208;Related Ternary Organosilicon Coinage Metal Sulfide Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of the organosilicon sulfide cluster [(PhSi)4S6] with [AgCl(PMe2Ph)2]2 or mixtures of MCl (M=Cu or Ag) and a phosphine ligand in CH2Cl2 caused its disassembly and reorganization under incorporation of metal phosphine moieties to form [(Ph3P)3Ag(&#956;&#8208;S)SiCl2Ph], [(PhSiClS2CH2)2(&#956;&#8208;dppb)], [{(dppbCu2)Cu(&#956;&#8211;dppb)0.5(PhSi)3S6}2], and [Na2(thf)1.5][(Me2PhPAg)(PhSi)3S6]. The latter two represent ternary M&#8722;S&#8722;Si&#8208;based clusters with complex crystal structures and wideband semiconductor&#8208;like optical gaps.







Abstract
Adamantane&#8208;type organotin sulfide clusters were recently shown to react with coinage metal phosphine complexes under replacement of an organic substituent by a metal&#8208;phosphine unit. An extension of such studies involving the silicon&#8208;based congener [(PhSi)4S6] (A) revealed that the cluster core will be partly disassembled and a {PhSi} moiety is replaced by a coinage metal phosphine complex to form [(Et3PAg)3(PhSi)3S6] (B) and [Na2(thf)2.33][(Me3PCu)(PhSi)3S6] (C). Herein, we present an extension of this work upon variation of the reactants and reaction conditions. Besides the isolation of crystalline precursor complexes [CuCl(PMe2Ph)3] (1) and [AgCl(PMe2Ph)2]2 (2), the study addresses reactions of A with AgCl and a phosphine ligand in CH2Cl2, upon which A is completely disassembled to form [(Ph3P)3Ag(&#956;&#8208;S)SiCl2Ph] (3). In another case a CH2 group, most likely stemming from CH2Cl2, was attached to the ligand, thus generating [{PhCl(S)SiSCH2P(Ph2)CH2CH2}2] (4). Upon using CuCl and 1,4&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)butane (dppb) we isolated the phosphine&#8208;bridged analog of B, [{(dppbCu2)CuP(Ph2)(CH2CH2)(PhSi)3S6}2] (5). In order to receive the yet elusive silver homolog of C, we used PMe2Ph as a bulkier ligand. This way we generated a 2D coordination polymer of the desired composition, [Na2(thf)1.5][(Me2PhPAg)(PhSi)3S6] (6). UV&#8208;visible spectra of 6 indicated a bandgap of 3.89&#8197;eV, thus blue&#8208;shifted in regards to B and C.

This way we generated a 2D coordination polymer of the desired composition, [Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(thf)&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;][(Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PhPAg)(PhSi)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;). UV-visible spectra of &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; indicated a bandgap of 3.89&#8197;eV, thus blue-shifted in regards to &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Oxidation of Vitamin D3 Enhanced by Long&#8208;Range Effects of a Substrate Channel Mutation in Cytochrome P450BM3 (CYP102A1)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;range effects from mutation of a substrate access tunnel residue selected by docking&#8208;guided design of cytochrome P450BM3 (CYP102A1) to loosen the interaction between two secondary structure elements reshaped the substrate binding pocket and increased the activity for the oxidation vitamin D3 to 25&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;vitamin D3, an important human and animal health supplement.







Abstract
Vitamin D deficiency affects nearly half the population, with many requiring or opting for supplements with vitamin D3 (VD3), the precursor of vitamin D (1&#945;,25&#8208;dihydroxyVD3). 25&#8208;HydroxyVD3, the circulating form of vitamin D, is a more effective supplement than VD3 but its synthesis is complex. We report here the engineering of cytochrome P450BM3 (CYP102A1) for the selective oxidation of VD3 to 25&#8208;hydroxyVD3. Long&#8208;range effects of the substrate&#8208;channel mutation Glu435Ile promoted binding of the VD3 side chain close to the heme, enhancing VD3 oxidation activity that reached 6.62&#8197;g of 25&#8208;hydroxyVD3 isolated from a 1&#8208;litre scale reaction (69.1&#8201;% yield; space&#8208;time&#8208;yield 331&#8197;mg/L/h).

         <title>Realizing Color Transitions for Three Copper (I) Cluster Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Materials by Adjusting Reaction Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three isomeric copper iodide cluster hybrid materials 1&#8211;3 were achieved by adjusting the reaction conditions. The crystal color transit from green, yellow to orange with high QYs at 57&#8201;%~88&#8201;%. All three complexes have good thermal stability, good solution processability, and high quantum yield. This study can provide development of cuprous iodide cluster luminescent materials.







Abstract
Copper iodide organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials have been favored by many researchers in the field of solid&#8208;state lighting (SSL) due to their structural diversity and optical adjustability. In this paper, three isomeric copper iodide cluster hybrid materials, Cu4I6(L)2(1), Cu5I4.5Cl2.5(L)2(2) and Cu5I7(L)2) (3) (L=1&#8208;(4&#8208;methylpyrimidin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan&#8208;1&#8208;ium), were achieved by adjusting the reaction conditions. The crystal color transit from green, yellow to orange and the internal quantum yield (IQY) increase from 57&#8201;%&#8211;88&#8201;%. All three complexes have good thermal stability, good solution processability, and high quantum yield. And origin and mechanism of luminescence of complexes were further studied. This study can provide ideas and theoretical basis for the regulation of cuprous iodide cluster luminescent materials.

         <title>High Rotational Barrier Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented class of atropisomers based on Ugi reaction that exhibit exceptional rotational barrier is reported. The versatility of our approach enables the synthesis of atropisomers &#8220;by design&#8221; and allow the conceptualization of this work in atroposelective synthesis and high&#8208;sensitivity modular balances. Single&#8208;crystal structures, combined by DFT calculations and dynamic NMR allow us to examine a plethora of &#960;&#8208;interactions.







Abstract
Atropisomers have attracted a great deal of attention lately due to their numerous applications in organic synthesis and to their employment in drug discovery. However, the synthetic arsenal at our disposal with which to access them remains limited. The research described herein is two&#8208;pronged; we both demonstrate the use of MCR chemistry as a synthetic strategy for the de novo synthesis of a class of atropisomers having high barriers to rotation with the simultaneous insertion of multiple chiral elements and we study these unprecedented molecular systems by employing a combination of crystallography, NMR and DFT calculations. By fully exploiting the synthetic capabilities of our chemistry, we have been able to monitor a range of different types of interaction, i.&#8201;e. &#960;&#8208;&#960;, CH&#8211;&#960;, heteroatom&#8208;&#960; and CD&#8211;&#960;, in order to conduct structure&#8208;property studies. The results could be applied both to atroposelective synthesis and in drug discovery.

         <title>Dynamic Structural Fluxionality in a Planar Tetracoordinate Carbon Cluster Stabilized by Boron Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported a molecular compasses CB2H5+ with a planar tetracoordinate carbon (ptC) atom, two ligand hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon rotate alternately. This is the first global minimum for boron&#8208;coordinated ptC clusters with dynamic fluxionality.







Abstract
The design of boron&#8208;based molecular rotors stems from boron&#8208;carbon binary clusters containing multiple planar hypercoordinate carbons (phCs, such as C2B8). However, the design of boron&#8208;coordinated phCs is challenging due to boron's tendency to occupy hypercoordinate centers more than carbon. Although this challenge has been addressed, the designed clusters of interest have not exhibited dynamic fluxionality similar to that of the initial C2B8. To address this issue, we report a &#963;/&#960; doubly aromatic CB2H5+ cluster, the first global minimum containing a boron&#8208;coordinated planar tetracoordinate carbon atom with dynamic fluxionality. Dynamics simulations show that two ligand H atoms exhibit alternate rotation, resulting in an intriguing dynamic fluxionality in this cluster. Electronic structure analysis reveals the flexible bonding positions of the ligand H atoms because they do not participate in &#960; delocalized bonding nor bond to any other non&#8208;carbon atom, highlighting this rotational fluxionality. Unprecedentedly, the fluxional process involves not only the usual conversion of the number of bonding atoms, but also the type of bonding (3c &#960; bonds &#8596;4c &#963; bonds), which is an uncommon fluxional mechanism. The cluster represents an effort to apply phC species to molecular machines.

         <title>CoCorrole&#8208;Functionalized PCN&#8208;222 for Carbon Monoxide Selective Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have combined the carbon monoxide chemisorption properties of cobalt corroles with the high porosity and stability of the PCN&#8208;222 MOFs. High performance materials for the selective and reversible adsorption of CO vs O2, N2 and CO2 at low pressure have been obtained.







Abstract
The high risk of CO poisoning justifies the need for indoor air quality control and warning systems based on the detection of low concentrations (ppm&#8208;ppb) of CO. Cobalt corrole complexes selectively bind CO vs. O2, CO2, N2, opening new fields of applications. By combining the CO chemisorption properties of cobalt corroles with the known sorption capacity of MOFs, we hope to obtain high performance sensing materials for CO detection. In addition, the exposed metal sites of MOFs lead to CO2 physisorption, allowing the co&#8208;detection of CO and CO2. In this work, PCN&#8208;222, a stable Zr&#8208;based MOF made from Ni(TCPP) with natural vacancies, has been used as a porous matrix for the grafting of electron&#8208;poor metallocorroles. The materials were characterized by powder XRD, SEM and optical microscopy, BET analyses and gas adsorption measurements at 298&#8197;K. No degradation of the crystalline structure of PCN&#8208;222 was observed. At 1&#8197;atm, the adsorbed CO(g) volumes measured for the best materials were 12.15&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 14.01&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 for CoCorr2@PCN&#8208;222 and CoCorr3@PCN&#8208;222 respectively, and both materials exhibited high CO chemisorption and selectivity against O2, N2, and CO2 at low pressure due to the highest energy of the chemisorption process vs physisorption.

         <title>Anions as Lewis Acids in Noncovalent Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#963; or &#960;&#8208;hole within a Lewis acid usually signals a positive electrostatic potential that can attract the negative region of an approaching nucleophile. Because of their overall negative charge, any such hole on an anion will typically indicate a negative potential. Nonetheless, it is shown here that a wide range of anions are able to act as Lewis acid in a noncovalent bond, despite a negatively charged &#963; or &#960;&#8208;hole. These bonds are constituted in large part by an attractive electrostatic interaction, even though negative regions of the two subunits face one another.







Abstract
The ability of an anion to serve as electron&#8208;accepting Lewis acid in a noncovalent bond is assessed via DFT calculations. NH3 is taken as the common base, and is paired with a host of ACln&#8722; anions, with central atom A=Ca, Sr, Mg, Te, Sb, Hg, Zn, Ag, Ga, Ti, Sn, I, and B. Each anion reacts through its &#963; or &#960;&#8208;hole although the electrostatic potential of this hole is quite negative in most cases. Despite the contact between this negative hole and the negative region of the approaching nucleophile, the electrostatic component of the interaction energy of each bond is highly favorable, and accounts for more than half of the total attractive energy. The double negative charge of dianions precludes a stable complex with NH3.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Silylcyclopentenes via Ball Milling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and environmentally friendly method for synthesizing silylcyclopentenes has been developed using Ar2SiH2, Li metal, and butadiene with the ball milling technique. Additionally, DFT calculations suggest that this transformation involves a nucleophilic addition of mechanochemically generated Si&#8722;Li intermediates with butadiene to form corresponding carbon anion species, which then completes the [4+1] cycloaddition process through nucleophilic substitution with Si&#8722;H.







Abstract
The development of innovative methods for synthesizing silylcyclopentene compounds is particularly important for enriching and improving the synthetical toolbox of organosilicon compounds. Herein, a facile approach has been developed for the synthesis of silylcyclopentenes promoted by mechanochemically generated organolithium species as silicon nucleophiles under ball milling conditions, avoiding the requirement of large amounts of bulk solvent. This operationally simple method demonstrates good functional group compatibility, which provides a great opportunity for further exploration of the synthetic applications of silylcyclopentenes. Density functional theory calculations indicated that the transient lithiosilole intermediates undergo a stepwise nucleophilic addition process, which governs this mechanic&#8208;force&#8208;promoted [4+1] cycloaddition reaction.

         <title>Superlong Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanowire Fabricated via Steam&#8208;Assisted Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile steam&#8208;assisted conversion is developed to fabricate superlong 1D Cu metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanowire through recrystallization mechanism. As&#8208;prepared 1D Cu MOF nanowire possesses identical crystal structure of MOF&#8208;74 and multiscale porous structure, which can effectively remove cationic dyes and is an ideal template to form Cu nanoparticle&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber with excellent electrocatalytic activity for glucose detection.







Abstract
1D nanomaterials have attracted great attention due to their outstanding anisotropic and linear structures. A facile method is developed to fabricate 1D copper metal&#8211;organic framework nanowires (Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;NW) through steam&#8208;assisted conversion from Cu&#8208;MOF precursors. During the steam&#8208;assisted conversion, Cu&#8208;MOF precursor gradually dissolves in methanol steam, and then recrystallized into Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;NW, which shows high aspect ratio of about 600 and identical crystal structure of MOF&#8208;74. As&#8208;prepared Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;NW with multiscale porous structure can effectively remove cationic dyes even in dye mixture. Moreover, Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;NW, as an ideal template, is calcined to form Cu nanoparticle&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber with maintaining its 1D morphology, which shows excellent electrocatalytic activity for the non&#8208;enzymatic sensing of glucose.

         <title>Design of an Acidic pH&#8208;Activated NIR Fluorescent Convertible Rhodamine&#8722;Hemicyanine Probe&#8208;Peptide Conjugate for Living Cancer Cell Active Targeted Selective Tracking of Lysosomes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A closed and an open state switchable rhodamine&#8208;hemicyanine probe&#8208;peptide conjugate is presented. Acidic pH&#8208;activated NIR fluorescent convertible probe&#8208;peptide conjugate can be used for live cancer cell active targeted selective tracking and ratiometric imaging of lysosomes.







Abstract
We have synthesized an acidic pH&#8208;activatable dual targeting ratiometric fluorescent probe&#8208;peptide conjugate using the SPPS protocol on Rink amide AM resin. Living carcinoma cell specific active targeting, successive cell penetration, and selective staining of lysosomes are accomplished. Real&#8208;time monitoring of lysosomes, 3D, and multicolor cancer cell imaging are also attained. The de novo design consists of the integration of multifunctionality into a single molecular scaffold, e.&#8201;g., RGDS peptide residue to target cancer cell surface overexpressed receptor &#945;V&#946;3 integrin, live&#8208;cell penetrating organic unsymmetrical rhodamine&#8208;hemicyanine chromophore comprising a lysosome targeting morpholine group, and an acidic pH openable spiro&#8208;lactam ring for a visible&#8208;to&#8208;NIR switchable ratiometric response. Water&#8208;soluble fluorescent probe&#8208;peptide conjugate exhibits intramolecular spirolactamization at basic pH through Arg amide N. The visible spirolactam state predominantly exists at physiological and basic pH and can be switched to the highly conjugated NIR open amide state (&#955;em=735&#8197;nm) through spiro&#8208;lactam ring opening triggered by acidic pH with a huge bathochromic shift (&#916;&#955;abs=336&#8197;nm, &#916;&#955;FL=265&#8197;nm). Moreover, pH&#8208;sensitive ratiometric optical switching is achieved. This in&#8197;situ acidic cancer cell lysosome activatable multifunctional fluorophore&#8208;peptide conjugate shows augmented molar absorptivity, enhanced quantum yield, and improved fluorescence lifetime at acidic lysosomal pH; negligible cytotoxicity; and dual targeted ratiometric imaging capability of living cancer cell selective lysosomes with a pKa value of 5.1.

         <title>Pre&#8208;Coordination Induced Further Deamination to Create Inter&#8208;Chain Cross&#8208;Linking in Carbon Nitride for Enhanced Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>

         <dc:description>
A KCl&#8208;guided, pre&#8208;coordination&#8208;induced further deamination strategy has been developed to create cross&#8208;linking between different chains of polymeric carbon nitride (PCN). This sufficient pre&#8208;coordination endows the resulting CNK&#8208;2 with a relatively high degree of cross&#8208;linking, which promotes efficient inter&#8208;chain charge transport. Consequently, the obtained CNK&#8208;2 exhibits significantly enhanced photocatalytic H&#8322;O&#8322; production.







Abstract
Creating cross&#8208;linking to establish efficient inter&#8208;chain charge&#8208;transfer channels in carbon nitride represents a promising strategy for enhancing its photocatalytic capabilities. Molten salt&#8208;assisted calcining has emerged as a method for preparing cross&#8208;linked carbon nitrides. However, the precise influence of molten salts on the molecular structure of carbon nitride remains to be fully elucidated. Herein, we develop a KCl guided cross&#8208;linking reaction to preliminarily reveal the formation mechanism of cross&#8208;linking. The cross&#8208;linking reaction is initiated by the pre&#8208;coordination of amino groups with K+. Subsequent heating at high temperature converts the amino groups into chlorines. Then, dechlorination leads to the formation of cross&#8208;linking. Thus, this cross&#8208;linking reaction can be accurately described as a pre&#8208;coordination&#8208;induced, two&#8208;step deamination reaction. The pre&#8208;coordination step plays a pivotal role in the cross&#8208;linking process. Sufficient pre&#8208;coordination results in a relatively high cross&#8208;linking degree of the as&#8208;prepared CNK&#8208;2. Consequently, CNK&#8208;2 demonstrates a significantly enhanced photocatalytic H2O2 production, with a generation rate of 682&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, about 59 times that of traditional carbon nitride.

&lt;p&gt;A KCl-guided, pre-coordination-induced further deamination strategy has been developed to create cross-linking between different chains of polymeric carbon nitride (PCN). This sufficient pre-coordination endows the resulting CNK-2 with a relatively high degree of cross-linking, which promotes efficient inter-chain charge transport. Consequently, the obtained CNK-2 exhibits significantly enhanced photocatalytic H&#8322;O&#8322; production.

&lt;p&gt;Creating cross-linking to establish efficient inter-chain charge-transfer channels in carbon nitride represents a promising strategy for enhancing its photocatalytic capabilities. Molten salt-assisted calcining has emerged as a method for preparing cross-linked carbon nitrides. However, the precise influence of molten salts on the molecular structure of carbon nitride remains to be fully elucidated. Herein, we develop a KCl guided cross-linking reaction to preliminarily reveal the formation mechanism of cross-linking. The cross-linking reaction is initiated by the pre-coordination of amino groups with K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Subsequent heating at high temperature converts the amino groups into chlorines. Then, dechlorination leads to the formation of cross-linking. Thus, this cross-linking reaction can be accurately described as a pre-coordination-induced, two-step deamination reaction. The pre-coordination step plays a pivotal role in the cross-linking process. Sufficient pre-coordination results in a relatively high cross-linking degree of the as-prepared CNK-2. Consequently, CNK-2 demonstrates a significantly enhanced photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production, with a generation rate of 682&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, about 59 times that of traditional carbon nitride.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
