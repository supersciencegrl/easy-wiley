         <title>Electrochemical N&#8208;Aroylation of Sulfoximines using Benzoyl Hydrazines with H2 Generation.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developed here is a robust electrochemical cross&#8208;coupling between aroyl hydrazine and NH&#8208;sulfoximine via concomitant cleavage and formation of C(sp2)&#8208;N bond with the evolution of H2 and N2 as innocuous by&#8208;products. This sustainable protocol avoids the use of toxic reagents and occurs at room temperature. The reaction proceeds via the generation of an aroyl and a sulfoximidoyl radical via anodic oxidation under constant current electrolysis (CCE), affording N&#8208;aroylated sulfoximine. The strategy is applied to late&#8208;stage sulfoximidation of L&#8208;menthol, (&#8208;)&#8208;borneol, D&#8208;glucose, vitamin&#8208;E derivatives, and marketed drugs such as probenecid, ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, ciprofibrate, and sulindac.

         <title>Carbodiimide and Isocyanate Hydroboration by a Cyclic Carbodiphosphorane Catalyst
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclic carbodiphosphorane catalyzes the hydroboration of carbodiimide and isocyanate substrates. DFT calculations support a mechanism involving activation of pinacolborane by the carbodiphosphorane catalyst, followed by hydride transfer and B&#8722;N bond formation.







Abstract
We report hydroboration of carbodiimide and isocyanate substrates catalyzed by a cyclic carbodiphosphorane catalyst. The cyclic carbodiphosphorane outperformed the other Lewis basic carbon species tested, including other zerovalent carbon compounds, phosphorus ylides, an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, and an N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin. Hydroborations of seven carbodiimides and nine isocyanates were performed at room temperature to form N&#8208;boryl formamidine and N&#8208;boryl formamide products. Intermolecular competition experiments demonstrated the selective hydroboration of alkyl isocyanates over carbodiimide and ketone substrates. DFT calculations support a proposed mechanism involving activation of pinacolborane by the carbodiphosphorane catalyst, followed by hydride transfer and B&#8722;N bond formation.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Amphoteric Reactivity of an Iron&#8208;Bispidine Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transient iron(III)&#8208;superoxido species in disguise orchestrates the reactivity of an iron(III)&#8208;alkylperoxido complex stabilized in an engineered bispidine scaffold.







Abstract
The reactivity of FeIII&#8208;alkylperoxido complexes has remained a riddle to inorganic chemists owing to their thermal instability and impotency towards organic substrates. These iron&#8208;oxygen adducts have been known as sluggish oxidants towards oxidative electrophilic and nucleophilic reactions. Herein, we report the synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of a relatively stable mononuclear high&#8208;spin FeIII&#8208;alkylperoxido complex supported by an engineered bispidine framework. Against the notion, this FeIII&#8208;alkylperoxido complex serves as a rare example of versatile reactivity in both electrophilic and nucleophilic reactions. Detailed mechanistic studies and computational calculations reveal a novel reaction mechanism, where a putative superoxido intermediate orchestrates the amphoteric property of the oxidant. The design of the backbone is pivotal to convey stability and reactivity to alkylperoxido and superoxido intermediates. Contrary to the well&#8208;known O&#8722;O bond cleavage that generates an FeIV&#8208;oxido species, the FeIII&#8208;alkylperoxido complex reported here undergoes O&#8722;C bond scission to generate a superoxido moiety that is responsible for the amphiphilic reactivity.

         <title>Preclinical Evaluation of Zn(II) Self&#8208;Assemblies with Selective Cytotoxic Activity Against Cancer Cells In Vitro and In Ovo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis&#8208;bidentate ligands L1 and L2 form dinuclear double helicates with Zn2+ and Cu2+ and these self&#8208;assemblies can bind phosphate and 4&#8208;nitrophenylphosphate anions. The complexes show selective cytotoxic and antitumor activity, but this is highly dependent upon which ligand, metal ion and anion are used. The lead compound [(L2)2Zn2]2+ displays in ovo efficacy with a 67&#8201;% reduction in tumor weight and 100&#8201;% embryo survival rate.







Abstract
Dipodal pyridylthiazole amine ligands L1 and L2 both form different metallo&#8208;supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies with Zn2+ and Cu2+ and these are shown to be toxic and selective towards cancer cell lines in&#8197;vitro. Furthermore, potency and selectivity are highly dependent upon the metal ions, ligand system and bound anion, with significant changes in chemosensitivity and selectivity dependent upon which species are employed. Importantly, significant anti&#8208;tumor activity was observed in ovo at doses that are non&#8208;toxic.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Cyanobactin Natural Product Balgacyclamide B</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic pathway for balgacyclamide B was developed in 17&#8208;steps and a 2&#8201;% overall yield. The synthetic pathway opens a new route towards recently isolated cyanobactin's, especially for the balgacyclamide family and its analogs. Advanced intermediates from the synthetic pathway are being used to explore porin&#8208;mediated transportation in gram&#8208;negative bacteria.







Abstract
Balgacyclamide A&#8722;C are a family of cyanobactin natural products isolated from freshwater cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa. These macrocyclic peptides are characterized by their oxazoline&#8208;thiazole core, their 7 or 8 stereocenters, and their antiparasitic activities. Balgacyclamide B is known for its activity towards Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine&#8208;resistant strain K1, Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, and Leishmania donovani. In this report, the first total synthesis of Balgacyclamide B is described in a 17&#8208;steps pathway and a 2&#8201;% overall yield. The synthetic pathway toward balgacyclamide B can be adapted for the future syntheses of balgacyclamide A and C. In addition, a brief history background of oxazolines syntheses is shown to emphasize the importance of the cyclization conditions used to interconvert or retain configuration of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy amides via dehydrative cyclization.

[1,2]&#8208;Brook rearrangement can dearomatize aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles! Through a one&#8208;pot four&#8208;step process that includes lithiation, nucleophilic addition, Brook rearrangement, and dearomatization reaction, we enable the formation of non&#8208;aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles with functional capabilities starting from readily available precursors. Subsequent functionalization reactions provide access to a diverse compound library.







Abstract
The [1,2]&#8208;Brook rearrangement stands as a potent technique for constructing complex molecules. In this study, we showcase its power in the dearomatization of aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles. Through a concise four&#8208;step process that integrates lithiation, nucleophilic addition, Brook rearrangement and dearomatization reaction, we demonstrate a versatile strategy for generating diverse non&#8208;aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles which exhibit ambident reactivities. Various acyl silanes, halo&#8208;pyridines, and quinolines have been explored within this context. The synthetic utility of this methodology is demonstrated through the construction of complex architectures.

         <title>Reversible Reactions of Nitric Oxide with a Binuclear Iron(III) Nitrophorin Mimic</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong attractive interactions between corrole subunits drive the release of nitric oxide from iron(III) nitrosyls, mimicking nitrophorin function.







Abstract
Construction of functional synthetic systems that can reversibly bind and transport the most biologically important gaseous molecules, oxygen and nitric oxide (NO), remains a contemporary challenge. Myoglobin and nitrophorin perform these respective tasks employing a protein&#8208;embedded heme center where one axial iron site is occupied by a histidine residue and the other is available for small molecule ligation, structural features that are extremely difficult to mimic in protein&#8208;free environments. Indeed, the hitherto reported designs rely on sophisticated multistep syntheses for limiting access to one of the two axial coordination sites in small molecules. We have shown previously that binuclear Ga(III) and Al(III) corroles have available axial sites, and now report a redox&#8208;active binuclear Fe(III) corrole, (1&#8208;Fe)2, in which each (corrolato)Fe(III) center is 5&#8208;coordinate, with one axial site occupied by an imidazole from the other corrole. The binuclear structure is further stabilized by attractive forces between the corrole &#960; systems. Reaction of NO with (1&#8208;Fe)2 affords mononuclear iron nitrosyls, and of functional relevance, the reaction is reversible: nitric oxide is released upon purging the nitrosyls with inert gases, thereby restoring (1&#8208;Fe)2 in solutions or films.

         <title>Nitronyl Nitroxide&#8208;Substituted Benzotriazinyl Tetraradical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;spin organic tetraradicals with significant intramolecular exchange interactions have high potential for advanced technological applications and fundamental research, but those synthesized to date possess limited stability and processability. In this work, we designed a tetraradical based on the Blatter&#8217;s radical and nitronyl nitroxide radical moieties and successfully synthesized it using the palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of triiodo&#8208;derivative of 1,2,4&#8208;benzotriazinyl radical with gold(I) nitronyl nitroxide&#8208;2&#8208;ide complex in the presence of a newly developed efficient catalytic system. The molecular and crystal structure of the tetraradical was confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The tetraradical possesses good thermal stability with decomposition onset at &#8764;150&#160;&#176;C in an inert atmosphere. The tetraradical exhibits reversible redox waves at &#8722;0.54 and 0.45 V vs Ag/AgCl. The magnetic properties of the tetraradical were characterized by SQUID magnetometry of polycrystalline powders and EPR spectroscopy in various matrices. The collected data, analyzed using high&#8208;level quantum chemical calculations, confirmed that the tetraradical has a triplet ground state and a nearby excited quintet state. The unique high stability of the prepared triazinyl&#8208;nitronylnitroxide tetraradical is a new milestone in the field of creating high&#8208;spin systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In this work, a straightforward synthesis of C3&#8208;N1&#8217; bisindolines is achieved by a formal umpolung strategy. The protocols were tolerant of a wide variety of substituents on the indole and indoline ring. In addition, the C3&#8208;N1&#8217; bisindolines could be converted to C3&#8208;N1&#8217; indole&#8208;indolines and C3&#8208;N1&#8217;&#8208;bisindoles.

         <title>Multielectron Redox Afforded by a Pincer Ligand Promoting Kumada Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The redox&#8208;active nature of a pincer has been exploited to conduct C&#8208;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions under mild conditions. A nickel complex comprising NNN&#8208;pincer is dimeric in solid state, and the structure displays a Ni2N2 diamond core. In the dimeric structure both ligand backbones house an electron, in the iminosemiquinonate form, to keep the metal&#8217;s oxidation state at +2. In the presence of aryl Grignard reagent, only 3 mol% loading the nickel complex generates Kumada cross&#8208;coupled product in good yield from a wide variety of aryl&#8208;X (X = I, Br, Cl) substrates. The ligand&#8208;based radical remains responsible to promote such coupling reaction following a radical pathway, that is suggested by TEMPO quenching. Furthermore, a radical&#8208;clock experiment along with tracing product distribution unambiguously supports the radical&#8217;s involvement through the catalytic cycle. A series of thorough mechanistic probation including computational DFT analysis disclose the cooperative action of both redox&#8208;active pincer ligand and the metal centre to drive the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Cascade Ring Expansion Reactions of Acryloyl Imides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocyclic and medium&#8208;sized ring ketones, lactones and lactams can all be made from common acryloyl imide starting materials via divergent, one&#8208;pot cascade ring expansion reactions. Following either conjugate addition with an amine or nitromethane, or osmium(VIII) catalysed dihydoxylation, rearrangement via a 4&#8208;atom ring expansion takes place spontaneously to form the ring expanded products. A second ring expansion can also be performed following a second iteration of imide formation and alkene functionalisation/ring expansion. In the dihydroxylation series, 3&#8208; or 4&#8208;atom ring expansion can be performed selectively, depending on whether the reaction is under kinetic or thermodynamic control.</dc:description>

         <title>Straightforward Synthesis of Pentagon&#8208;Embedded Expanded [11]Helicenes for Radiative Cooling Property</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Design and synthesis of two new pentagon&#8208;embedded carbo[11]helicenes through the post&#8208;functionalization of twistacene, possessing high enantiomerization barriers of 42.29&#8197;kcal/mol and 40.76&#8197;kcal/mol based on TD&#8208;DFT calculation are described. Not only they can be chemically oxidized into stable cationic radicals, but also display promising radiative cooling behavior.







Abstract
Two new pentagon&#8208;embedded carbo[11]helicenes have been designed and synthesized in a three&#8208;step process, which are the first example of carbo[11]helicenes through the post&#8208;functionalization of twistacene. TD&#8208;DFT analyses indicate that both of them possess high enantiomerization barriers of 42.29&#8197;kcal/mol and 40.76&#8197;kcal/mol, respectively. They emit strong red fluorescence and can be chemically oxidized into stable cationic radicals upon addition of AgSbF6 evidenced by the bathochromic&#8208;shifted absorption spectra and the appearance of electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals. In addition, such helical derivatives can be chosen as radiative cooling materials in a glass model house, and the maxima of 5.4&#8201;&#176;C for the former and 6.5&#8201;&#176;C for the latter are found in the comparative tests, which might be caused by the NIR reflective response.

         <title>Integrating Benzoxazine&#8208;PDMS 3D Networks with Carbon Nanotubes for flexible Pressure Sensors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our study focuses on preparing benzoxazine&#8208;terminated poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PH&#8208;PDMS) and developing elastomeric nanocomposites by incorporating multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Through thermally curing, these nanocomposites demonstrate excellent electrical conductivity and mechanical stability, attributed to favorable MWCNT&#8208;matrix interactions which enable efficient dispersion of MWCNTs. These findings highlight the potential of these materials for pressure&#8208;sensing applications.







Abstract
Shapeable and flexible pressure sensors with superior mechanical and electrical properties are of major interest as they can be employed in a wide range of applications. In this regard, elastomer&#8208;based composites incorporating carbon nanomaterials in the insulating matrix embody an appealing solution for designing flexible pressure sensors with specific properties. In this study, PDMS chains of different molecular weight were successfully functionalized with benzoxazine moieties in order to thermally cure them without adding a second component, nor a catalyst or an initiator. These precursors were then blended with 1 weight percent of multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using an ultrasound probe, which induced a transition from a liquid&#8208;like to a gel&#8208;like behavior as CNTs generate an interconnected network within the matrix. After curing, the resulting nanocomposites exhibit mechanical and electrical properties making them highly promising materials for pressure&#8208;sensing applications.

Simple two&#8208;step synthesis towards pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;b][3]benzazepines and 7,11b&#8208;dihydro&#8208;6H&#8208;pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines from readily available (dihydro)isoquinolines is described. The key moment of the transformations is a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement in vinyl&#8208;, ethynyl substituted di(tetra)hydroisoquinolines. The influence of substituents, nucleophiles, and solvents is shown (up to 10 examples).







Abstract
Under microwave (MW) irradiation at 150&#8201;&#176;C in toluene and in the presence of nucleophiles (DMAP, triphenylphosphine and tetrahydrothiophene) 1&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;2&#8208;vinyldi&#8208; and tetrahydroisoquinolines undergo [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement providing pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;b][3]benzazepines in good yields. The replacement of toluene with acetonitrile directs the rearrangement towards the formation of 7,11b&#8208;dihydro&#8208;6H&#8208;pyrido[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines.

         <title>An Unusual Macrocyclic Hexamer of an Iso&#8208;Tellurazole N&#8208;Oxide Featuring CTe&#8230;O Chalcogen Bonds is Formed by &#954;6&#8208;O Complexation to Fe(II) and Ni(II)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble iso&#8208;tellurazole N&#8208;oxide enabled the synthesis of complexes with hard transition metal ions, revealing a new structural motif in which six molecules assemble a macrocycle through C&#8208;Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O chalcogen bonds.







Abstract
Studies of the supramolecular chemistry of iso&#8208;tellurazole N&#8208;oxides have been confined to non&#8208;polar media until now. To overcome that limitation, an iso&#8208;tellurazole N&#8208;oxide was derivatized with a primary alcohol group; the compound is soluble in polar solvents and stable in acidic to neutral aqueous media. Nickel (II) and iron (II) form macrocyclic complexes with six molecules of that iso&#8208;tellurazole N&#8208;oxide in a hitherto not&#8208;observed macrocyclic arrangement defined by CTe&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O chalcogen bonds and &#954;6&#8208;O bound to the metal ion.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies of the supramolecular chemistry of iso-tellurazole &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxides have been confined to non-polar media until now. To overcome that limitation, an iso-tellurazole &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxide was derivatized with a primary alcohol group; the compound is soluble in polar solvents and stable in acidic to neutral aqueous media. Nickel (II) and iron (II) form macrocyclic complexes with six molecules of that iso-tellurazole &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxide in a hitherto not-observed macrocyclic arrangement defined by CTe&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O chalcogen bonds and &#954;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-O bound to the metal ion. This behaviour is in sharp contrast with the &#954;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;-Te (n=1,2,4) complexes formed by soft metal ions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Total Chemical Synthesis of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Receptor&#8208;Binding Domain</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An elegant total chemical synthesis route has been developed for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike&#8208;RBD. Leveraging a multi&#8208;segment convergent native chemical ligation strategy, this innovative approach holds immense promise in advancing the development of effective intervention strategies against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. The highly efficient chemical synthesis method outlined here can be directly applied to the synthesis of other mutated variants or the mirror&#8208;image of the spike RBD for screening against peptide/protein&#8208;based library.







Abstract
SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and its global spread have created an unprecedented public health crisis. The spike protein of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 has gained significant attention due to its crucial role in viral entry into host cells and its potential as both a prophylactic and a target for therapeutic interventions. Herein, we report the first successful total synthesis of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), highlighting the key challenges and the strategies employed to overcome them. Appropriate utilization of advanced solid phase peptide synthesis and cutting&#8208;edge native chemical ligation methods have facilitated the synthesis of this moderately large protein molecule. We discuss the problems encountered during the chemical synthesis and approaches taken to optimize the yield and the purity of the synthetic protein molecule. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the chemically synthesized homogeneous spike RBD efficiently binds to the known mini&#8208;protein binder LCB1. The successful chemical synthesis of the spike RBD presented here can be utilized to gain valuable insights into SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike RBD biology, advancing our understanding and aiding the development of intervention strategies to combat future coronavirus outbreaks. The modular synthetic approach described in this study can be effectively implemented in the synthesis of other mutated variants or enantiomer of the spike RBD for mirror&#8208;image drug discovery.

         <title>Isolation, Characterization and Reactivity of Key Intermediates Relevant to Reductive (Electro)catalysis with Cp*Rh Complexes Containing Pyridyl&#8208;MIC (MIC=Mesoionic Carbene) Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolation and crystallographic, electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical and theoretical investigations of key intermediates relevant to reductive (electro)catalysis with Rh&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;MIC complexes are presented. Additionally, the interconversion between them and their role in pre&#8208;catalytic activation are discussed.







Abstract
In recent years, metal complexes of pyridyl&#8208;mesoionic carbene (MIC) ligands have been reported as excellent homogeneous and molecular electrocatalysts. In combination with group 9 metals, such ligands form highly active catalysts for hydrogenation/transfer hydrogenation/hydrosilylation catalysis and electrocatalysts for dihydrogen production. Despite such progress, very little is known about the structural/electrochemical/spectroscopic properties of crucial intermediates for such catalytic reactions with these ligands: solvato complexes, reduced complexes and hydridic species. We present here a comprehensive study involving the isolation, crystallographic characterization, electrochemical/spectroelectrochemical/theoretical investigations, and in&#8208;situ reactivity studies of all the aforementioned crucial intermediates involving Cp*Rh and pyridyl&#8208;MIC ligands. A detailed mechanistic study of the precatalytic activation of [RhCp*] complexes with pyridyl&#8208;MIC ligands is presented. Intriguingly, amphiphilicity of the [RhCp*]&#8208;hydride complexes was observed, displaying the substrate dependent transfer of H+, H or H&#8722;. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first of its kind targeting intermediates and reactive species involving metal complexes of pyridyl&#8208;MIC ligands and investigating the interconversion amongst them.

         <title>Please Mind the Gap: Highly Condensed P&#8211;N Networks in LiP4N7 and Li3&#8722;xP6N11&#8722;x(NH)x</title>

The highly condensed lithium nitridophosphates LiP4N7 and Li3&#8722;xP6N11&#8722;x(NH)x were prepared at pressures of 10&#8197;GPa in the multianvil press. Their structures were elucidated and their thermal stabilities and expansion coefficients were investigated. Synthesis of these materials closes a gap in the periodic table, as other alkali nitridophosphates like NaP4N7 or Na3P6N11 have been known for decades.







Abstract
Alkali nitridophosphates AP4N7 and A3P6N11 (A=Na, K, Rb, Cs) have been known for decades. However, their Li homologues have remained elusive. In this work, the highly condensed lithium (imido)nitridophosphates LiP4N7 and Li3&#8722;xP6N11&#8722;x(NH)x (x=1.66(3)) were synthesized from LiPN2 and P3N5 in the multianvil press at 10&#8197;GPa. They constitute the first lithium nitridophosphates with 3D networks exhibiting a degree of condensation larger than 0.5 and high thermal stability. LiP4N7 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group P212121 with a=4.5846(6)&#8197;&#197;, b=8.0094(11)&#8197;&#197;, and c=13.252(2)&#8197;&#197; (Z=4). Li3&#8722;xP6N11&#8722;x(NH)x crystallizes in the triclinic space group P
 with Z=2, a=4.6911(11)&#8197;&#197;, b=7.024(2)&#8197;&#197;, c=12.736(3)&#8197;&#197;, &#945;=87.726(11), &#946;=80.279(11), and &#947;=70.551(12)&#176;. Both compounds are stable against hydrolysis in air.

         <title>Oxidants Controlled C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization of N&#8208;Aryltetrahydroisoquinolines: The Construction of the Quaternary Carbon Center and Cleavage of the C&#8722;N Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A C&#8722;H functionalization of &#945;&#8208;THIQ esters was achieved by triarylamine radical cation salt and tert&#8208;butyl nitrite, respectively, providing a series of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy THIQ esters and N&#8208;NO skeleton containing keto esters under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Initiated by triarylamine radical cation salt (TBPA), the direct C&#8722;H bond functionalization of &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;aryltetrahydroisoquinoline esters was smoothly realized, giving a series of &#945;&#8208;hydroxylated derivatives with a quaternary carbon center in good yields. Differently, in the presence of tert&#8208;butyl nitrite (TBN), the C&#8722;N single bond was cleaved to keto esters. The mechanistic study revealed that these reactions were mediated by a similar mechanism, in which the N&#8208;nitrosation might provide a driving force to the C&#8722;N bond cleavage.

&lt;p&gt;A C&#8722;H functionalization of &#945;-THIQ esters was achieved by triarylamine radical cation salt and &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl nitrite, respectively, providing a series of &#945;-hydroxy THIQ esters and &lt;i&gt;N-&lt;/i&gt;NO skeleton containing keto esters under mild reaction conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initiated by triarylamine radical cation salt (TBPA), the direct C&#8722;H bond functionalization of &#945;-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-aryltetrahydroisoquinoline esters was smoothly realized, giving a series of &#945;-hydroxylated derivatives with a quaternary carbon center in good yields. Differently, in the presence of &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl nitrite (TBN), the C&#8722;N single bond was cleaved to keto esters. The mechanistic study revealed that these reactions were mediated by a similar mechanism, in which the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-nitrosation might provide a driving force to the C&#8722;N bond cleavage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>9&#8208;Azahomocubane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
9&#8208;Azahomocubane is unique amongst the nitrogen derivatives of homocubane, as it contains a secondary nitrogen atom, which can be used as a building block through amide bond formation. Herein reported is the first synthesis of 9&#8208;azahomocubane, which was achieved via a rarely utilized Stieglitz rearrangement, and confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis. The chemical stability of 9&#8208;azahomocubane exceeds that of the 1&#8208;azahomocubane, as predicted, although the basicity and calculated strain energy are similar.







Abstract
Homocubane, a highly strained cage hydrocarbon, contains two very different positions for the introduction of a nitrogen atom into the skeleton, e.&#8201;g., a position 1 exchange results in a tertiary amine whereas position 9 yields a secondary amine. Herein reported is the synthesis of 9&#8208;azahomocubane along with associated structural characterization, physical property analysis and chemical reactivity. Not only is 9&#8208;azahomocubane readily synthesized, and found to be stable as predicted, the basicity of the secondary amine was observed to be significantly lower than the structurally related azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, although similar to 1&#8208;azahomocubane.

         <dc:description>The two&#8208;electron reduction of 2,3&#8208;dimethylbuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene (DMB) with &#946;&#8208;diketiminate and guanidinate substituted dimagnesium(I) compounds has given complexes in which two amido&#8208;magnesium fragments are bridged through the &#960;&#8208;system of the DMB dianion, viz. [(LMg)2(&#956;&#8208;DMB)] (L = XylNacnac, [HC(MeCNXyl)2]&#8208;, Xyl = 2,6&#8208;xylyl; or Priso = [(DipN)2CNPri2]&#8208;, Dip = 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl). Similar double reductions of [4]dendralene (4dend) have afforded the complexes, [(LMg)2(&#956;&#8208;4dend)] (L = ArNacnac, Ar = Xyl or mesityl (Mes); or Priso) in which the 4dend dianion is &#960;&#8208;coordinated to the amido&#8208;magnesium fragments. Treatment of several such complexes with THF leads to Z&#8208; to E&#8208;isomerization of the dendralene fragment, and formation of purely &#963;&#8208;bonded Mg&#8210;C interactions in the THF coordinated products [{(ArNacnac)(THF)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;4dend)] (Ar = Xyl, Mes or Dip).

Preliminary reactions of [(LMg)2(&#956;&#8208;DMB)] with H2 and/or CO yielded a series of products, including novel magnesium hydride compounds, products derived from couplings of CO with the reduced DMB fragment (viz. magnesium dimethylcyclohexadienediolates), and one magnesium cyclopropanetriolate complex from the magnesium(I) induced coupling of DMB with H2 and CO.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyranthiones/Pyrones: &#8220;Click and Release&#8221; Donors for Subcellular Hydrogen Sulfide Delivery and Labeling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), one of the most important gasotransmitters, plays a critical role in endogenous signaling pathways of many diseases. However, developing H2S donors with both tunable release kinetics and high release efficiency for subcellular delivery has been challenging. Here, we describe a click and release reaction between pyrone/pyranthiones and bicyclononyne (BCN). This reaction features a release of CO2/COS with second&#8208;order rate constants comparable to Strain&#8208;Promoted Azide&#8208;Alkyne Cycloaddition reactions (SPAACs). Interestingly, pyranthiones showed enhanced reaction rates compared to their pyrone counterparts. We investigated pyrone biorthogonality and demonstrated their utility in protein labeling applications. Moreover, we synthesized substituted pyranthiones with H2S release kinetics that can address the range of physiologically relevant H2S dynamics in cells and achieved quantitative H2S release efficiency in vitro. Finally, we explored the potential of pyranthiones as H2S/COS donors for mitochondrial&#8208;targeted H2S delivery in living cells.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Scientists are increasingly paying attention to using theoretical design as a guide combined with modern in&#8208;situ characterization techniques to develop catalysts with high activity, low cost, and long&#8208;term life. The review discusses the progress of catalyst theoretical design and corresponding experiments based on three typical oxygen evolution catalytic mechanisms, including the adsorbate evolution, lattice oxygen&#8208;mediated, and unconventional bifunctional mechanisms. This work briefly describes the commonly used tools and descriptors in theory as well as the electrochemical techniques and characterizations in experiments. Our purpose is to sort out the ways to closely integrate the theoretical method and experimental verification from the perspective of reaction mechanism, and to provide some experience reference for the future development of theoretical tools and experimental technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile access to cationic methylstannylenes and silylenes stabilized by E&#8210;Pt bonding and their methyl group transfer reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a family of cationic methylstannylene and chloro&#8208; and azidosilylene organoplatinum(II) complexes supported by a neutral, binucleating ligand. Methylstannylenes MeSn:+ are stabilized by coordination to PtII and are formed by facile Me group transfer from dimethyl or monomethyl PtII complexes, in the latter case triggered by concomitant B&#8211;H, Si&#8211;H, and H2 bond activation that involves hydride transfer from Sn to Pt. A cationic chlorosilylene complex was obtained by formal HCl elimination and Cl&#8211; removal from HSiCl3 under ambient conditions. The computational studies show that stabilization of cationic methylstannylenes and cationic silylenes is achieved through weak coordination to neutral N&#8208;donor ligand binding pocket. The analysis of the electronic potentials, as well as the Laplacian of electron density, also reveals the differences in the character of Pt&#8210;Si vs. Pt&#8210;Sn bonding. We demonstrate the importance of a ligand&#8208;supported binuclear Pt/tetrel core and weak coordination to facilitate access to tetrylium&#8208;ylidene Pt complexes, and a transmetalation approach to the synthesis of MeSnII:+ derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Sensors Based on Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to the advantages of high surface area, tenable polygonal porosity, predictable and stable structure, and precise chemical control, covalent organic frameworks offer numerous potential in addressing the crucial points for sensing application. Here, we systematically review recent chemical sensors based on covalent organic frameworks.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a type of crystalline porous polymer composed of light elements through strong covalent bonds. COFs have attracted considerable attention due to their unique designable structures and excellent material properties. Currently, COFs have shown outstanding potential in various fields, including gas storage, pollutant removal, catalysis, adsorption, optoelectronics, and their research in the sensing field is also increasingly flourishing. In this review, we focus on COF&#8208;based sensors. Firstly, we elucidate the fundamental principles of COF&#8208;based sensors. Then, we present the primary application areas of COF&#8208;based sensors and their recent advancements, encompassing gas, ions, organic compounds, and biomolecules sensing.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening of 1,3&#8208;Imidazole Based Mesoionic Carbenes (iMICs) and Ring&#8208;Closing Clicks: Facile Access to iMIC&#8208;Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable unmasked iMICs are extremely scarce and have limited shelf&#8208;life. An unprecedented ring&#8208;opening of iMICs to N&#8208;ethynylformimidamides (eFIMs) has been reported. eFIMs are thermally stable under an inert atmosphere and show moderately air&#8208;stability. They are excellent iMIC&#8208;surrogates and readily undergo ring&#8208;closing&#8208;clicks with a variety of (non)metal Lewis acids, affording iMIC&#8208;compounds (iMIC)[M] with zero waste and easy workup.







Abstract
Herein, ring&#8208;opening of mesoionic carbenes (iMICs) (iMIC=[ArC{N(Dipp)}2C(SiMe3)C:) (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3, Ar=Ph, 4&#8208;Me2NC6H4 or 4&#8208;PhC6H4) based on an 1,3&#8208;imidazole scaffold to yield N&#8208;ethynylformimidamide (eFIM) derivatives as crystalline solids (eFIM={(Dipp)N=C(Ar)N(Dipp)}C&#8801;CSiMe3) is reported. eFIMs are thermally stable under inert gas atmosphere and show moderate air stability (t1/2=3&#8197;h for Ar=Ph). eFIMs are excellent surrogates of iMICs, which generally have a limited shelf&#8208;life, and readily undergo ring&#8208;closing click reactions with a variety of main&#8208;group as well as transition metal Lewis acids to form hitherto challenging iMIC&#8208;compounds in good to excellent yields. In addition to the relevance of eFIMs in the synthesis of iMIC&#8208;compounds, quantification of the stereoelectronic properties of a representative iMIC (Ar=Ph) by experimental and theoretical methods suggests remarkably &#963;&#8208;donor property and steric profile of these new ligand sets.

         <title>Deamination of Polyols from the Glycolysis of Polyurethane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phasing out of landfilling is inevitable, chemical recycling allows the consideration of plastic waste as a resource to get the most out of it to produce new valuable materials.







Abstract
Methylenedianiline (MDA) is a secondary, undesired, product of the glycolysis process of polyurethane (PU) scraps due to hydrolysis and pyrolysis side reactions. As an aromatic and carcinogen amine, MDA poses different problems in handling, transporting, and labelling recycled polyols derived from glycolysis, hindering the closure of PU recycling loop. Aiming to provide a solution to this issue, in this work different deaminating agents (DAs) were investigated with the purpose of analyzing their reactivity with MDA. A first part of the study was devoted to the analysis of MDA formation as a function of reaction time and catalyst concentration (potassium acetate) during glycolysis. It was observed that the amount of MDA increases almost linearly with the extent of PU depolymerization and catalyst content. Among the DAs analyzed 2&#8208;ethylhexyl glycidyl ether (2&#8208;EHGE), and acetic anhydride (Ac2O) showed interesting performance, which allowed MDA content to be diminished below the limit for labelling prescription in 30 minutes. PU rigid foams were, therefore, synthesized from the corresponding recycled products and characterized in terms of thermal and mechanical performance. Ac2O&#8208;deaminated polyols led to structurally unstable foams with poor compressive strength, while 2&#8208;EHGE&#8208;deaminated products allowed the production of foams with improved mechanical performance and unaltered thermal conductivity.

         <title>Regulating the Interfacial Charge Density by Constructing a Novel Zn Anode&#8208;Electrolyte Interface for Highly Reversible Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thepolar organic molecule amidinothiourea (ATU), as an electrolyte additive, can be stably adsorbed on the surface of zinc metal to construct the zinc anode&#8208;electrolyte interface and build new Zn&#8208;bond, promoting Zn2+ desolvation and deposition kinetics. Meanwhile, the hydrogen bonding network of the electrolyte can be reconstructed by ATU, which facilitates the migration of cation.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) have attracted considerable attention. However, due to the uneven distribution of charge density at Zn anode&#8208;electrolyte interface, severe dendrites and corrosion are generated during cycling. In this work, a facile and scalable strategy to address the above&#8208;mentioned issues has been proposed through regulating the charge density at Zn anode&#8208;electrolyte interface. As a proof of concept, amidinothiourea (ATU) with abundant lone&#8208;pair electrons is employed as an interfacial charge modifier for Zn anode&#8208;electrolyte interface. The uniform and increased interfacial charge distribution on Zn anode&#8208;electrolyte interface has been obtained. Moreover, the unique Zn&#8208;bond constructed between N atoms and Zn2+ as well as the hydrogen bonds are formed among ATU and Ac&#8722; anion/active H2O, which promote the migration and desolvation behavior of Zn2+ at anode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Accordingly, at a trace concentration of 0.01&#8197;mg&#8201;mL&#8722;1 ATU, these features endow Zn anode with a long cycling life (more than 800&#8197;h), and a high average Columbic efficiency (99.52&#8201;%) for Zn||Cu batteries. When pairing with I2 cathode, the improved cycling ability (5000 cycles) with capacity retention of 77.9&#8201;% is achieved. The fundamental understanding on the regulation of charge density at anode&#8208;electrolyte interface can facilitate the development of AZIBs.

         <title>Magnetic Relaxations of Chromium Nitride Porphyrinato Complexes Driven by the Anisotropic g&#8208;Factor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detailed analyses for vibrational and dynamical magnetism of chromium nitride (CrN2&#8722;)&#8208;porphyrinato complex revealed that g&#8208;value anisotropy accelerates magnetic relaxations greater than the internal magnetic field from nuclear spin does.







Abstract
Molecule&#8208;based magnetic materials are useful candidates as the spin qubit due to their long coherence time and high designability. The anisotropy of the g&#8208;values of the metal complexes can be utilized to access the individual spin of the metal complexes, making it possible to achieve the scalable molecular spin qubit. For this goal, it is important to evaluate the effect of g&#8208;value anisotropy on the magnetic relaxation behaviour. This study reports the slow magnetic relaxation behaviour of chromium nitride (CrN2+) porphyrinato complex (1), which is structurally and magnetically similar with the vanadyl (VO2+) porphyrinato complex (2) which is known as the excellent spin qubit. Detailed analyses for vibrational and dynamical magnetism of 1 and 2 revealed that g&#8208;value anisotropy accelerates magnetic relaxations greater than the internal magnetic field from nuclear spin does. These results provide a design criterion for construction of multiple spin qubit based on g&#8208;tensor engineering.

Abstract
Metal imine&#8208;thiolate complexes, M(NS)2 are known to undergo imine C&#8722;C bond formation to give M(N2S2) complexes (M=Co, Ni) containing a redox&#8208;active ligand. Although these transfor&#8208;mations are not typically quantitative, we demonstrate here that the one&#8208;electron reduction of a related Ni bis(imine&#8208;thiolate) complex affords the corresponding paramagnetic [Ni(N2S2)]&#8208; anion (2&#8901;&#8722;) exclusively; subsequent oxidation with [Cp2Fe]BF4 then affords a high yield of neutral 2 (Cp=&#951;5&#8208;cyclopentadienyl). Moreover, electrochemical studies indicate that a second one&#8208;electron reduction affords the diamagnetic dianion. Both anionic products were isolated and characterized by SC&#8208;XRD and their electronic structures were investigated by UV&#8208;vis spectro&#8208;electrochemistry, EPR and NMR spectroscopy, and DFT studies. These studies show that reduction proceeds primarily on the ligand, with (N2S2)4&#8722; containing both thiolate and ring&#8208;delocalized anions.

         <title>Multifunctional Photoelectroactive Materials for Optoelectronic Applications Based on Thieno[3,4&#8208;b]pyrazines and Thieno[1,2,5]thiadiazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we introduce a novel family of symmetrical thiophene&#8208;based small molecules with a Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8211;Donor structure. These compounds feature three different acceptor units: benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (Bz), thieno[3,4&#8208;b]pyrazine (Pz), and thieno[1,2,5]thiadiazole (Tz), coupled with electron donor units based on a carbazole&#8208;thiophene derivative. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT), we investigate how the molecular geometry and strength of the central acceptor unit impact the redox and spectroscopic properties. Notably, the incorporation of Pz and Tz moieties induces a significant redshift in the absorption and emission spectra, which extend into the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region, simultaneously reducing their energy gaps (~1.4&#8208;1.6 eV). This shift is attributed to the increased coplanarity of the oligomeric inner core, both in the ground (S0) and excited (S1) states, due to the enhanced quinoidal character as supported by bond&#8208;length alternation (BLA) analysis. These structural changes promote better &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization and facilitate photoinduced charge transfer processes in optoelectronic devices.&#160;Notably, we show that Pz&#8208; and Tz&#8208;containing molecules exhibit NIR electrochromic behavior and present ambivalent character in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. Finally, theoretical calculations suggest that these molecules could serve as effective two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) probes, further expanding their potential in optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the influence of the phosphorus&#8208;heteroatom substitution in Nnicotine on its electronic and vibrational spectroscopic properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The influence of phosphorus substitution of nitrogen in heterocyclic compounds on the vibrational spectroscopy as well as frontier molecular orbitals are analyzed. Nicotine with two nitrogen atoms in its structure is taken as the sample system to be studied computationally. By replacing the nitrogen atom in one or both rings of this molecule with phosphorus, three nicotine derivatives are created. The vibrational circular dichroism and infrared spectra of these four molecules in their monomer state, as well as the assemblies up to trimers are determined. The aforementioned spectra are calculated using static quantum chemical calculations employing cluster&#8208;weighted approach. The calculated gas phase spectra of nicotine are compared to their respective experimental spectra. It is observed that the nicotine derivatives with phosphorus in the methylpyrrolidine ring have considerably different gas phase and bulk phase vibrational circular dichroism spectra when compared to nicotine. The phosphorus substitution reduces the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital as well as altering the polarizability and reactivity of the investigated molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepwise Functionalization of Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Containing [2]Rotaxane with Pentafluorophenyl Ester Stoppers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Detailed investigations on the stepwise bis&#8208;functionalization of a pillar[5]arene&#8208;containing rotaxane building block have been carried out. Upon a first stopper exchange, the pillar[5]arene moiety of the mono&#8208;acylated product is preferentially located close to its reactive pentafluorophenyl ester stopper, thus limiting the accessibility of the reactive carbonyl group by the nucleophilic reagents. Selective mono&#8208;functionalization is thus very efficient. Introduction of a second stopper is then possible to generate dissymmetrical rotaxanes with different amide stoppers. Moreover, when dethreading is possible upon the second acylation, the pillar[5]arene plays the role of a protecting group allowing the synthesis of dissymmetrical axles particularly difficult to prepare under statistical conditions.&#160;Finally, detailed conformational analysis of the rotaxanes revealed that the position of the pillar[5]arene moiety on its axle subunit is mainly governed by polar interactions in nonpolar organic solvents while solvophobic effects are playing a major role in polar solvents.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of sp&#8208;Hybridized Nitrogen Cation by Lewis Acid&#8208;Base Complex Formation with Intramolecular Iodine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we show that the sp&#8208;hybridized nitrogen cation is strongly stabilized by a peri&#8208;iodine substituent in the tetralone system. The cation is captured by anionic species such as CF3CO2&#8208;, affording hypervalent iodine(III) compounds with a short nitrogen&#8208;iodine (N&#8208;I) bond, in which the cation serves as a Lewis acid. Notably, the O&#8208;I bond of the O&#8208;trifluoroacetate or O&#8208;acetate is intrinsically weaker than the N&#8208;I bond due to its more ionic character and is further weakened by protonation in trifluoroacetic acid. As a result, the oxygen ligand can dissociate in the presence of a Br&#248;nsted acid, affording a I+ cation intermediate that retains the N&#8208;I bond. We isolated the cation as the tetrafluoroborate, and characterized it experimentally by 1H NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray structure analysis, and theoretically by means of DFT calculation. The results suggest that the N&#8208;I bonded cation is intrinsically stable, and is weakly coordinated with water and the BF4 counter anion or trifluoroacetate anion. This cation can be employed as a reagent for &#945;&#8208;oxidation of ketones.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of highly functionalized cyclopropanes from 2&#8208;substituted allylic derivatives is reported. Using ethyl diazo acetate, the reaction, catalyzed by a chiral ruthenium complex (Ru(II)&#8208;Pheox), furnished the corresponding easily separable cis and trans cyclopropanes in moderate to high yields (32&#8208;97%) and excellent ee (86&#8208;99%). This approach significantly extends the portfolio of accessible enantioenriched cyclopropanes from an underexplored class of olefins.

Using ethyl diazo acetate, the reaction, catalyzed by a chiral ruthenium complex (Ru(II)-Pheox), furnished the corresponding easily separable cis and trans cyclopropanes in moderate to high yields (32-97%) and excellent ee (86-99%). This approach significantly extends the portfolio of accessible enantioenriched cyclopropanes from an underexplored class of olefins. DFT calculations suggest that an outer-sphere mechanism is operative in this system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Conformationally Stable &#960;&#8208;Expanded X&#8208;Type Double Helicene Comprising Dihydropyracylene Units with Multistage Redox Behavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A &#960;&#8208;expanded X&#8208;type double [5]helicene comprising dihydropyracylene moieties was synthesized from commercially available acenaphthene. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis revealed the unique highly twisted structure of the compound resulting in the occurrence of two enantiomers which were separated by chiral HPLC, owing to their high conformational stability. The compound shows strongly bathochromically shifted UV/vis absorption and emission bands with small Stokes shift and considerable photoluminescence quantum yield and circular polarized luminescence response. The electrochemical studies revealed five facilitated reversible redox events, including three reductions and two oxidations, thus qualifying the compound as chiral multistage redox amphoter. The experimental findings are in line with the computational studies based on density functional theory pointing towards increased spatial extension of the frontier molecular orbitals over the polycyclic framework and a considerably narrowed HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on so&#8208;called "hidden FLPs" (FLP: frustrated Lewis pair) consisting of a phosphorus ylide featuring a group 13 fragment in the ortho position of a phenyl ring scaffold to form five&#8208;membered ring structures. Although the formation of the Lewis acid/base adducts was observed in the solid state, most of the title compounds readily react with carbon dioxide to provide stable insertion products. Strikingly, 0.3&#8211;3.0 mol% of the reported aluminum and gallium/carbon&#8208;based ambiphiles catalyze the reduction of CO2 to methanol with satisfactory high selectivity and yields using pinacol borane as stoichiometric reduction equivalent. Comprehensive computational studies provided valuable mechanistic insights and shed more light on activity differences.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerated Synthesis of Nanolayered MWW Zeolite by Interzeolite Transformation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hierarchical zeolites can offer substantial benefits over bulk zeolites in catalysis. A drawback towards practical implementation is their lengthy synthesis, often requiring complex organic templates. This work described an accelerated synthesis of nanolayered MWW zeolite based on the combination of interzeolite transformation (IZT) with a dual&#8208;templating strategy. FAU zeolite, hexamethyleneimine (HMI), and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were respectively employed as Al source and primary zeolite, structure directing agent, and exfoliating agent. This approach allowed to reduce the synthesis of nanolayered MWW to 48 h, which is a considerable advance over the state of the art. Tracking structural, textural, morphological and chemical properties during crystallization showed that 4&#8208;membered&#8208;ring (4MR) units derived from the FAU precursor are involved in the faster formation of MWW in comparison to a synthesis procedure from amorphous precursor. CTAB restricts the growth of the zeolite in the c&#8208;direction, resulting in nanolayered MWW. Moreover, we shown that this approach can speed up the synthesis of nanolayered FER. The merits of nanolayered MWW zeolites are demonstrated in terms of improved catalytic performance in the Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition of 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran and ethylene to p&#8208;xylene compared to bulk reference MWW sample.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We described how computational mechanistic understanding has led directly to the discovery of new 2H&#8208;phosphindole for C&#8208;CAr bond activation and dearomatization reaction. Herein, we uncover an unexpected intramolecular C&#8208;H bond activation with 2H&#8208;phosphindole derivative. This new intriguing experimental observation and further theoretical studies led to an extension of the reaction mechanism with 2H&#8208;phosphindole. Through DFT calculations, we confirm that within a five&#8208;membered ring, the polarizable PC3 unit orchestrates the formation of an electrophilic phosphorus atom (P+) and a nucleophilic carbon atom (C&#8208;). This kinetically accessible ambiphilic phosphorus/carbon couple is spatially separated by geometric constraints, and their reactivity is modulated through structural resonance.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Addition of Organosulfur Compounds to Alkynes and Alkenes: Catalysis and Catalyst Poisons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 64, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed addition of organosulfur compounds to carbon&#8208;carbon unsaturated bonds has been considered as one of the challenging reactions due to the catalyst poisons. Recently, novel systems have been investigated to suppress the catalyst poisons. This article highlights the pioneering studies on the catalytic addition of organosulfur compounds to alkynes and alkenes and describes their catalysis and catalyst poisons.







Abstract
The addition of heteroatom compounds to alkynes and alkenes is an atom&#8208;efficient method of carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond formation and is widely used as a fundamental synthetic method for the construction of functional molecules. Nevertheless, examples of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed addition reactions of group&#8197;16 heteroatom compounds to carbon&#8208;carbon unsaturated bonds have been limited due to the widespread belief that organic sulfur and selenium compounds are representative catalyst poisons. In recent decades, however, several seminal catalytic reactions of sulfur compounds have been developed, providing important insights into catalysis and poisons. Therefore, this paper focuses on the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed addition of organosulfur compounds to alkynes and alkenes, gains comprehensive insights into the catalysis and catalyst poisons, and proposes concepts for the development of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions of group&#8197;16 heteroatom compounds.

Abstract
Earth&#8208;abundant photosensitizers are highly sought after for light&#8208;mediated applications, such as photoredox catalysis, depollution and energy conversion schemes. Homoleptic and heteroleptic copper(I) complexes are promising candidates in this field, as copper is abundant and the corresponding complexes are easily obtained in smooth conditions. However, some heteroleptic copper(I) complexes suffer from low (photo)stability that leads to the gradual formation of the corresponding homoleptic complex. Such degradation pathways are detrimental, especially when recyclability is desired. This study reports a novel approach for the heterogenization of homoleptic and heteroleptic Cu complexes on silica nanoparticles. In both cases, the photophysical properties upon surface immobilization were only slightly affected. Excited&#8208;state quenching with aryl diazonium derivatives occurred efficiently (108&#8211;1010&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) with heterogeneous and homogeneous photosensitizers. Moderate but almost identical yields were obtained for the &#945;&#8208;arylation of enol acetate using the homoleptic complex in homogeneous or heterogeneous conditions. Importantly, the silica&#8208;supported photocatalysts were recycled with moderate loss in photoactivity over multiple experiments. Transient absorption spectroscopy confirmed that excited&#8208;state electron transfer occurred from the homogeneous and heterogeneous homoleptic copper(I) complexes to aryl diazonium derivatives, generating the corresponding copper(II) center that persisted for several hundreds of microseconds, compatible with photoredox catalysis applications.

Homoleptic and heteroleptic copper(I) complexes are promising candidates in this field, as copper is abundant and the corresponding complexes are easily obtained in smooth conditions. However, some heteroleptic copper(I) complexes suffer from low (photo)stability that leads to the gradual formation of the corresponding homoleptic complex. Such degradation pathways are detrimental, especially when recyclability is desired. This study reports a novel approach for the heterogenization of homoleptic and heteroleptic Cu complexes on silica nanoparticles. In both cases, the photophysical properties upon surface immobilization were only slightly affected. Excited-state quenching with aryl diazonium derivatives occurred efficiently (10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) with heterogeneous and homogeneous photosensitizers. Moderate but almost identical yields were obtained for the &#945;-arylation of enol acetate using the homoleptic complex in homogeneous or heterogeneous conditions. Importantly, the silica-supported photocatalysts were recycled with moderate loss in photoactivity over multiple experiments. Transient absorption spectroscopy confirmed that excited-state electron transfer occurred from the homogeneous and heterogeneous homoleptic copper(I) complexes to aryl diazonium derivatives, generating the corresponding copper(II) center that persisted for several hundreds of microseconds, compatible with photoredox catalysis applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dimension Tuning of All&#8208;Inorganic Ag&#8208;Based Metal Halides by Solvent Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 64, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, different dimensions of Cs2AgCl3 (1D) and CsAgCl2 (2D) metal halides have been synthesized in different solvents, DMF and DMSO, respectively. By comparing the functional group, dielectric constant, and donor number among four solvents (DMF, DMSO, DMAC, DMPU), we find the donor number plays the predominant role in the dimension tuning.







Abstract
Dimension growth of metal halides is important for its properties and applications. However, such dimension control of the metal halides is rarely reported in the literature and the growth mechanism is not clear yet. A minute difference of solvent properties can tremendously alter the process of nucleation and growth of crystals. Herein, an intriguing phenomenon of dimension tuning for Ag&#8208;based metal halides is reported. The 1D Cs2AgCl3 crystals can be obtained in pure DMF while the 2D CsAgCl2 crystals are obtained in pure DMSO. Both exhibit bright yellow emission, which are derived from self&#8208;trapping excitons (STEs). The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of Cs2AgCl3 (1D) and CsAgCl2 (2D) are 28.46&#8201;% and 20.61&#8201;%, respectively. In order to understand the mechanism of the dimension change, additional solvents (N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide, DMAC, 1,3&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;Tetrahydropyrimidin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one, DMPU) are also selected to process the precursor for crystal growth. By comparing the functional group, dielectric constant, and donor number among the four solvents, we find the donor number plays the predominant role in nucleation process for Cs2AgCl3 and CsAgCl2. This research reveals the relationship between coordination ability of the solvent and the dimension of metal halides.

The amorphous titanium dioxide is used to coat eGaSn nanodroplets (eGaSn NDs) to construct the core&#8208;shell structure of eGaSn@TiO2 nanodroplets (eGaSn@TiO2 NDs). The amorphous TiO2 shell forms a stable SEI film, alleviates volume expansion, and provides electron/ion transport channels. The resulting eGaSn@TiO2 NDs exhibit high capacities of 580, 540, 515, 485, 456 and 426&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5&#8197;C, respectively. No obvious decay is observed in more than 500&#8197;cycles with a capacity of 455&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;C.







Abstract
Gallium&#8208;based alloy liquid metal batteries currently face limitations such as volume expansion, unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film and substantial capacity decay. In this study, amorphous titanium dioxide is used to coat eutectic GaSn nanodroplets (eGaSn NDs) to construct the core&#8208;shell structure of eGaSn@TiO2 nanodroplets (eGaSn@TiO2 NDs). The amorphous TiO2 shell (~6.5&#8197;nm) formed a stable SEI film, alleviated the volume expansion, and provided electron/ion transport channels to achieve excellent cycling performance and high specific capacity. The resulting eGaSn@TiO2 NDs exhibited high capacities of 580, 540, 515, 485, 456 and 426&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5&#8197;C, respectively. No significant decay was observed after more than 500&#8197;cycles with a capacity of 455&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;C. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (in&#8197;situ XRD) was used to explore the lithiation mechanism of the eGaSn negative electrode during discharge. This study elucidates the design of advanced liquid alloy&#8208;based negative electrode materials for high&#8208;performance liquid metal batteries (LMBs).

A metal&#8208;free natural dye has been developed to selectively convert methane to methyl trifluoroacetate (CH3TFA) using visible light, probably due to the formation of a chloride&#8208;bridged dimer undergoing fast intra&#8208;complex charge transfer.

         <title>2D Non&#8208;van der Waals Nanoplatelets of Hematene and Magnetene: Nonlinear Optical Response and Optical Limiting Performance from UV to NIR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 64, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study reports that non&#8208;van der Waals 2D materials, hematene and magnetene, show very efficient optical limiting (OL) from UV to visible, with their optical limiting onset (OLon) values exhibiting a decreasing trend towards UV irradiation wavelengths. The obtained results render these materials very promising candidates for OL&#8208;related applications, such as the protection of human retinal from high&#8208;power laser.







Abstract
Recently, the preparation of some hematene and magnetene ultrathin non van der Waals (non&#8208;vdW) 2D nanoplatelets was reported starting from hematite and magnetite natural iron ores. The present work reports on the determination and evaluation of the nonlinear optical response and the optical limiting (OL) action of these 2D nanoplatelets dispersed in water under ns laser excitation. The obtained results show that both hematene and magnetene exhibit strong nonlinear absorption and refraction, comparable and even larger than those of other van der Waals (vdW) 2D counterpart materials. In addition, due to their strong nonlinear absorption, both hematene and magnetene show exceptional OL performance from the UV to visible, attaining very low values of optical limiting onset (OLon), comparable and even lower than that of vdW 2D nanomaterials, such as graphene, graphene oxide, other transition metal dichalcogenides like MoS2, WS2 and MoSe2, black phosphorous and antimonene. Moreover, hematene was found to exhibit more efficient OL action than magnetene for all the excitation wavelengths studied, attributed to more efficient ligand to metal charge transfer. The present findings open new possibilities for the potential use of these non&#8208;vdW 2D materials in photonics and optoelectronics, e.&#8201;g., as optical limiters and optical switchers.

         <title>Stable Dication Diradicals of Triply Fused Metallo Chlorin&#8208;Porphyrin Heterodimers: Impact of the Bridge on the Control of Spin Coupling to Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 64, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two highly stable, novel, triply fused dinickel(II)/dicopper(II) chlorin&#8208;porphyrin dication diradical heterodimers are reported in which the bridge is completely fused between two porphyrin macrocycles. UV&#8208;vis, EPR, and ESI&#8208;MS investigations enabled us to identify some of the key reactive intermediates disclosing tentative mechanistic details of such an unusual transformation.







Abstract
We report an unexpected rearrangement, controlled by the nature of the bridge, leading to the formation of novel, remarkably stable triply fused dinickel(II)/dicopper(II) chlorin&#8208;porphyrin dication diradical heterodimers in excellent yields. Here, a dipyrromethene bridge gets completely fused between two porphyrin macrocycles with two new C&#8722;C and one C&#8722;N bonds. The two macrocycles exhibit extensive &#960;&#8208;conjugation through the bridge, which results in an antiferromagnetic coupling between the two &#960;&#8208;cation radicals. In addition, the macrocyclic distortion also favours a rare intramolecular ferromagnetic interaction between the CuII and &#960;&#8208;cation radical spins to form a triplet state. The structural and electronic perturbation in the unconjugated dication diradical possibly enables the bridging pyrrolic nitrogen to undergo a nucleophilic attack at the nearby &#946;&#8208;carbon of the porphyrin &#960;&#8208;cation radical with a computed free energy barrier of &gt;20&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 which was supplied in the form of reflux condition to initiate such a rearrangement process. UV&#8208;vis, EPR and ESI&#8208;MS spectroscopies were used to monitor the rearrangement process in&#8197;situ in order to identify the key reactive intermediates leading to such an unusual transformation.

         <title>Construction of [NbO]6&#8722;x&#8208;xS Structure to Change Charge Density and Regulate Spontaneous Polarization to Achieve Efficient Pyro&#8208;Photo&#8208;Electric Water Splitting System of NaNbO3</title>

The changed interaction between S&#8722;Nb&#8722;S in [NbO]6&#8722;x&#8208;xS structure, and the constructed [NbO]6&#8722;x&#8208;xS structure realized the regulation of charge density change and spontaneous polarization. S&#8208;doping weakens the S&#8722;Nb&#8722;S interaction in the [NbO]6&#8722;x&#8208;xS structure, which effectively improves the performance of the pyro&#8208;photo&#8208;electric synergistic water splitting system.







Abstract
Pyroelectric materials in the field of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting still face the problems of difficult low spontaneous polarization intensity and excessive carrier recombination. Based on the above problems, we altered the interaction between S&#8722;Nb&#8722;S in the [NbO]6&#8722;x&#8208;xS structure, and the constructed [NbO]6&#8722;x&#8208;xS structure achieved the regulation of charge density change and spontaneous polarization. The results show that under the stimulation of light and temperature fluctuations, the current density of the NS&#8208;4 photoanode is as high as 0.574&#8197;mA/cm2 at 1.23&#8197;VRHE, which is about 1.59&#8197;times higher than the pure NaNbO3 current density value, and the NS &#8722;4 photoanode achieves IPCE value of 16.08&#8201;%. The first&#8208;principles density&#8208;functional theory calculations (DFT) reveal the principle of the [NbO]6&#8722;x&#8208;xS structure for the suppression function of the carrier recombination and the improvement function of the pyroelectric effect. The analysis shows that the S&#8208;doping leads to the weakening of S&#8722;Nb&#8722;S interactions in the [NbO]6&#8722;x&#8208;xS structure, which improves the pyroelectric effect and suppresses the photo/pyro&#8208;generated carrier recombination, and effectively enhances the performance of the pyro&#8208;photo&#8208;electric synergistic water splitting system. This work promotes the development of pyroelectric materials in the field of photoelectrochemical water splitting.

         <title>Closed Synthetic Cycle for Nickel&#8208;Based Dihydrogen Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 64, November 16, 2023. </description>

Nickel complexes with a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand (TIMENiPr) have been synthesized and characterized. Starting from the Ni0 precursor, a NiII hydride is synthesized that reacts with protons to form a rare Ni&#8722;H2 intermediate, which was studied by NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Further reduction closes the synthetic cycle.







Abstract
Dihydrogen evolution was observed in a two&#8208;step protonation reaction starting from a Ni0 precursor with a tripodal N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand. Upon the first protonation, a NiII monohydride complex was formed, which was isolated and fully characterized. Subsequent protonation yields H2 via a transient intermediate (INT) and an isolable NiII acetonitrile complex. The latter can be reduced to regenerate its Ni0 precursor. The mechanism of H2 formation was investigated by using a deuterated acid and scrutinized by 1H NMR spectroscopy and gas chromatography. Remarkably, the second protonation forms a rare nickel dihydrogen complex, which was detected and identified in solution and characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy. DFT&#8208;based computational analyses were employed to propose a reaction profile and a molecular structure of the Ni&#8722;H2 complex. Thus, a dihydrogen&#8208;evolving, closed&#8208;synthetic cycle is reported with a rare Ni&#8722;H2 species as a key intermediate.

         <title>Zn&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Using Triptycene Hexacarboxylate Ligands: Synthesis, Structure, and Gas&#8208;Sorption Properties</title>

Two types of zinc MOF, Zn&#8208;X2Trp and Zn&#8208;X2PET (X=H, F, Cl, Br, I, Me, Et, Pr), with difunctionalized triptycene&#8208;hexacarboxylate ligands H6X2Trp and H6X2PET that differ in size have been synthesized. All of these Zn&#8208;MOFs show high thermal stability as well as H2&#8208; and CO2&#8208;adsorption capacities. Moreover, MOFs with smaller pore size showed higher H2 and CO2 adsorption. Thus, the introduction of methyl, chloro, and bromo substituents at the bridgehead positions of the triptycene ligands enhances the H2&#8208; and CO2&#8208;adsorption capacities.







Abstract
A series of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) based on zinc ions and two triptycene ligands of different size have been synthesized under solvothermal conditions. Structural analyses revealed that they are isostructural 3D&#8208;network MOFs. The high porosity and thermal stability of these MOFs can be attributed to the highly rigid triptycene&#8208;based ligands. Their BET specific surface areas depend on the size of the triptycene ligands. In contrast to these surface&#8208;area data, the H2 and CO2 adsorption of these MOFs is larger for MOFs with small pores. Consequently, we introduced functional groups to the bridge&#8208;head position of the triptycene ligands and investigated their effect on the gas&#8208;sorption properties. The results unveiled the role of the functional groups in the specific CO2 binding via an induced interaction between adsorbates and the functional groups. Excellent H2 and CO2 properties in these MOFs were achieved in the absence of open metal sites.

         <title>Theoretical Prediction of Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 Using a 2D Catalyst Composed of 3&#8201;d Transition Metal and Hexaamine Dipyrazino Quinoxaline</title>

Computational screening of 2D materials composed of 3d transition metal and hexaamine dipyrazino quinoxalineas efficient catalysts for carbon dioxide reduction reactions.







Abstract
Transition metals and organic ligands combine to form metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), which possess distinct active sites, large specific surface areas and stable porous structures, giving them considerable promise for CO2 reduction electrocatalysis. In the present study, using spin polarisation density&#8208;functional theory, a series of 2D MOFs constructed from 3d transition metal and hexamethylene dipyrazoline quinoxaline(HADQ) were investigated. The calculated binding energies between HADQ and metal atoms for the ten TM&#8208;HADQ monolayers were strong sufficient to stably disperse the metal atoms in the HADQ monolayers. Of the ten catalysts tested, seven (Sc, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ti, V and Cr) exhibited high CO2 reduction selectivity, while Mn, Fe and Co required pH values above 2.350, 6.461 and 6.363, respectively, to exhibit CO2 reduction selectivity. HCOOH was the most important producer for Sc, Zn, Ni and Mn, while CH4 was the main producer for Ti, Cr, Fe and V. Cu and Co were less selective, producing HCHO, CH3OH, and CH4 simultaneously at the same rate&#8208;determining step and limiting potential. The Cu&#8208;HADQ catalyst had a high overpotential for the HCHO product (1.022&#8197;V), while the other catalysts had lower overpotentials between 0.016&#8197;V and 0.792&#8197;V. Thus, these results predict TM&#8208;HADQ to show excellent activity in CO2 electrocatalytic reduction and to become a promising electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction.

         <title>Binary Metallic CuCo5S8 Anode for High Volumetric Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 64, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binary metallic CuCo5S8 is successfully synthesized and evaluated as a CA&#8208;free anode in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Because of the metallic properties of the material, the CA&#8208;free anode exhibits superior rate and cyclic performances. The high electrode density and multi&#8208;electron transfer during the charge&#8208;discharge process enable CuCo5S8 anode to display an outstanding volumetric capacity.







Abstract
With the rapid improvement of compact smart devices, fabricating anode materials with high volumetric capacity has gained substantial interest for future sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) applications. Herein, a novel bimetal sulfide CuCo5S8 material is proposed with enhanced volumetric capacity due to the intrinsic metallic electronic conductivity of the material and multi&#8208;electron transfer during electrochemical procedures. Due to the intrinsic metallic behavior, the conducting additive (CA) could be removed from the electrode fabrication without scarifying the high rate capability. The CA&#8208;free CuCo5S8 electrode can achieve a high volumetric capacity of 1436.4&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;cm&#8722;3 at a current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 100&#8201;% capacity retention over 2000&#8197;cycles in SIBs, outperforming most metal chalcogenides, owing to the enhanced electrode density. Reversible conversion reactions are revealed by combined measurements for sodium systems. The proposed new strategy offers a viable approach for developing innovative anode materials with high&#8208;volumetric capacity.

Chemical synthesis of two common core human milk oligosaccharides&#8212;para&#8208;lacto&#8208;N&#8208;hexaose (pLNH) and para&#8208;lacto&#8208;N&#8208;neohexaose (pLNnH)&#8212;using a convergent 3+3 approach has been reported.







Abstract
Human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) have emerged as a very active area of research in glycoscience and nutrition. HMO are involved in the early development of infants and may help to prevent certain diseases. The development of chemical methods for obtaining individual HMO aids the global effort dedicated to understanding the roles of these biomolecules. Reported herein is the chemical synthesis of two common core hexasaccharides found in human milk, i.&#8201;e. para&#8208;lacto&#8208;N&#8208;hexaose (pLNH) and para&#8208;lacto&#8208;N&#8208;neohexaose (pLNnH). After screening multiple leaving groups and temporary protecting group combinations, a 3+3 convergent coupling strategy was found to work best for obtaining these linear glycans.

Based on Cu ang Ag catalysis as well as phosphine catalysis, we have developed efficient methods for the synthesis of three different types of CF3&#8208;substituted compounds (quinoline&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates, quinoline&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates, and indolines) from the same starting materials such as o&#8208;trifluoroacetylanilines and propiolates.

In this work, we have developed selective methods for the synthesis of quinoline&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates and quinoline&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates as well as (indolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)acetates through copper&#8208;, silver&#8208;, or phosphine&#8208;catalyzed reaction of propiolates with 2&#8242;&#8208;amino&#8208;2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroacetophenones. The approaches proposed ensure synthesis of substituted quinoline carboxylates and (indolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)acetates in good yields. Introduction of alkynones into the reaction with 2&#8242;&#8208;amino&#8208;2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroacetophenones gives acyl substituted derivatives in good yields.

         <title>Improved Triplex&#8208;Forming Isoorotamide PNA Nucleobases for A&#8722;U Recognition of RNA Duplexes
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 64, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four isoorotamide nucleobases (Io5&#8722;Io8) are reported for incorporation into peptide nucleic acids aimed at RNA triple&#8208;helix formation. These extended nucleobases require only two hydrogen bonds across the Hoogsteen face of the A&#8722;U base pair for strong and selective binding, unlike previously reported extended nucleobases. Molecular dynamics simulations provide further insight into triple helical binding affinity and selectivity.







Abstract
Four new isoorotamide (Io)&#8208;containing PNA nucleobases have been designed for A&#8722;U recognition of double helical RNA. New PNA monomers were prepared efficiently and incorporated into PNA nonamers for binding A&#8722;U in a PNA:RNA2 triplex. Isothermal titration calorimetry and UV thermal melting experiments revealed slightly improved binding affinity for singly modified PNA compared to known A&#8208;binding nucleobases. Molecular dynamics simulations provided further insights into binding of Io bases in the triple helix. Together, the data revealed interesting insights into binding modes including the notion that three Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds are unnecessary for strong selective binding of an extended nucleobase. Cationic monomer Io8 additionally gave the highest affinity observed for an A&#8208;binding nucleobase to date. These results will help inform future nucleobase design toward the goal of recognizing any sequence of double helical RNA.

         <title>Amphiphilic Molecules Exhibiting Zwitterionic Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer and Near&#8208;Infrared Emission for the Detection of Amyloid &#946; Aggregates in Alzheimer's Disease
</title>

A novel zwitterionic excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer molecular system exhibits high affinity towards amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) aggregates and allows for in&#8197;vivo near&#8208;infrared (NIR) imaging of amyloid plaques in transgenic Alzheimer's vs. wild&#8208;type mice.







Abstract
Chromophores with zwitterionic excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) have been shown to have larger Stock shifts and red&#8208;shifted emission wavelengths compared to the conventional &#960;&#8208;delocalized ESIPT molecules. However, there is still a dearth of design strategies to expand the current library of zwitterionic ESIPT compounds. Herein, a novel zwitterionic excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer system is reported, enabled by addition of 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane (TACN) fragments on a dicyanomethylene&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran (DCM) scaffold. The solvent&#8208;dependent steady&#8208;state photophysical studies, pKa measurements, and computational analysis strongly support that the ESIPT process is more efficient with two TACN groups attached to the DCM scaffold and not affected by polar protic solvents. Impressively, compound DCM&#8208;OH&#8208;2&#8208;DT exhibits a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission at 740&#8197;nm along with an uncommonly large Stokes shift. Moreover, DCM&#8208;OH&#8208;2&#8208;DT shows high affinity towards soluble amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) oligomers in&#8197;vitro and in 5xFAD mouse brain sections, and we have successfully applied DCM&#8208;OH&#8208;2&#8208;DT for the in&#8197;vivo imaging of A&#946; aggregates and demonstrated its potential use as an early diagnostic agent for AD. Overall, this study can provide a general molecular design strategy for developing new zwitterionic ESIPT compounds with NIR emission in&#8197;vivo imaging applications.

Extractants: The diphenylpyrrole&#8208;strapped calix[4]pyrrole and its dual host systems involving crown ethers enable the extraction of various fluoride and chloride salts from water.







Abstract
The anion binding features of diphenylpyrrole&#8208;strapped calix[4]pyrrole 1 have been investigated by means of 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and ITC (isothermal titration calorimetry), as well as single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Receptor 1 bearing an auxiliary pyrrolic NH donor and solubilizing phenyl groups on the strap was found to bind F&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, and Br&#8722; as their tetrabutylammonium salts with high affinity in DMSO&#8208;d6. In addition, receptor 1 was found to extract the fluoride anion (as both its tetraethylammonium (TEA+) and tetrabutylammonium (TBA+) salts), as well as the chloride anion into chloroform&#8208;d from an aqueous source phase. Cation metathesis using TBAI or the use of a dual host approach involving crown ethers enabled receptor 1 to extract simple alkali metal fluoride or chloride salts from water. Quantitative binding of NaF by receptor 1 was observed in 20&#8201;% D2O&#8208;DMSO&#8208;d6 allowing for the direct determination of the NaF concentration in an unknown sample.

         <title>Intramolecular Through&#8208;Space Double&#8208;Electron Transfer Between A Pair of Redox&#8208;Active Guanidine Units Aligned by Dithiolate Bridges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 64, November 16, 2023. </description>

Transfer in pairs: Intramolecular through&#8208;space electron transfer between an oxidized, dicationic and a reduced, neutral triguanidine unit is observed if the two units are preorientated by a dithiolate bridge.







Abstract
Using unconventional synthesis protocols, two redox&#8208;active triguanidine units are connected by a dithiolate bridge, aligning the two redox&#8208;active units in close proximity. The reduced, neutral and the tetracationic redox states with two dicationic triguanidine units are isolated and fully characterized. Then, the dicationic redox states are prepared by mixing the neutral and tetracationic molecules. At low temperatures, the dications are diamagnetic (singlet ground state) with two different triguanidine units (neutral and dicationic). At room temperature, the triplet state with two radical monocationic triguanidine units is populated. At low temperature (210&#8197;K), chemical exchange by intramolecular through&#8208;space electron&#8208;transfer between the two triguanidine units is evidenced by EXSY NMR spectroscopy. Intramolecular through&#8208;space transfer of two electrons from the neutral to the dicationic triguanidine unit is accompanied by migration of the counterions in opposite direction. The rate of double&#8208;electron transfer critically depends on the bridge. No electron&#8208;transfer is measured in the absence of a bridge (in a mixture of one dicationic and one neutral triguanidine), and relatively slow electron transfer if the bridge does not allow the two triguanidine units to approach each other close enough. The results give detailed, quantitative insight into the factors that influence intramolecular through&#8208;space double&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer processes.

&lt;p&gt;Using unconventional synthesis protocols, two redox-active triguanidine units are connected by a dithiolate bridge, aligning the two redox-active units in close proximity. The reduced, neutral and the tetracationic redox states with two dicationic triguanidine units are isolated and fully characterized. Then, the dicationic redox states are prepared by mixing the neutral and tetracationic molecules. At low temperatures, the dications are diamagnetic (singlet ground state) with two different triguanidine units (neutral and dicationic). At room temperature, the triplet state with two radical monocationic triguanidine units is populated. At low temperature (210&#8197;K), chemical exchange by intramolecular through-space electron-transfer between the two triguanidine units is evidenced by EXSY NMR spectroscopy. Intramolecular through-space transfer of two electrons from the neutral to the dicationic triguanidine unit is accompanied by migration of the counterions in opposite direction. The rate of double-electron transfer critically depends on the bridge. No electron-transfer is measured in the absence of a bridge (in a mixture of one dicationic and one neutral triguanidine), and relatively slow electron transfer if the bridge does not allow the two triguanidine units to approach each other close enough. The results give detailed, quantitative insight into the factors that influence intramolecular through-space double-electron-transfer processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlling the Crystallisation and Hydration State of Crystalline Porous Organic Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 64, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High throughput screening was used to rapidly identify a new crystalline porous salt (CPOS). Using flow chemistry, the CPOS was scaled, and the material was shown to have permeant porosity with a carbon dioxide uptake of 4.3&#8197;mmol/g at 195&#8197;K, making it one of the most porous and scalable CPOS reported to date.







Abstract
Crystalline porous organic salts (CPOS) are a subclass of molecular crystals. The low solubility of CPOS and their building blocks limits the choice of crystallisation solvents to water or polar alcohols, hindering the isolation, scale&#8208;up, and scope of the porous material. In this work, high throughput screening was used to expand the solvent scope, resulting in the identification of a new porous salt, CPOS&#8208;7, formed from tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfophenyl)methane (TSPM) and tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)methane (TAPM). CPOS&#8208;7 does not form with standard solvents for CPOS, rather a hydrated phase (Hydrate2920) previously reported is isolated. Initial attempts to translate the crystallisation to batch led to challenges with loss of crystallinity and Hydrate2920 forming favorably in the presence of excess water. Using acetic acid as a dehydrating agent hindered formation of Hydrate2920 and furthermore allowed for direct conversion to CPOS&#8208;7. To allow for direct formation of CPOS&#8208;7 in high crystallinity flow chemistry was used for the first time to circumvent the issues found in batch. CPOS&#8208;7 and Hydrate2920 were shown to have promise for water and CO2 capture, with CPOS&#8208;7 having a CO2 uptake of 4.3&#8197;mmol/g at 195&#8197;K, making it one of the most porous CPOS reported to date.

         <title>Mechanistic Characterisation of Collinodiene Synthase, a Diterpene Synthase from Streptomyces collinus</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 64, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two homologs of the diterpene synthase CotB2 for cyclooctat&#8208;9&#8208;en&#8208;7&#8208;ol from Streptomyces collinus and S. iakyrus were investigated. The enzyme from S. collinus produces the new compound collinodiene besides cyclooctat&#8208;9&#8208;en&#8208;7&#8208;ol and other side products. Isotopic labelling experiments were performed to enlighten the cyclisation mechanism.







Abstract
Two homologs of the diterpene synthase CotB2 from Streptomyces collinus (ScCotB2) and Streptomyces iakyrus (SiCotB2) were investigated for their products by in&#8197;vitro incubations of the recombinant enzymes with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, followed by compound isolation and structure elucidation by NMR. ScCotB2 produced the new compound collinodiene, besides the canonical CotB2 product cyclooctat&#8208;9&#8208;en&#8208;7&#8208;ol, dolabella&#8208;3,7,18&#8208;triene and dolabella&#8208;3,7,12&#8208;triene, while SiCotB2 gave mainly cyclooctat&#8208;9&#8208;en&#8208;7&#8208;ol and only traces of dolabella&#8208;3,7,18&#8208;triene. The cyclisation mechanism towards the ScCotB2 products and their absolute configurations were investigated through isotopic labelling experiments.

         <title>Palladium Complexes of N&#8208;Methylcorroles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 64, November 16, 2023. </description>

Opening the corrole door to divalent cations: Inner&#8208;core N&#8208;methylation of corrole makes this contracted macrocycle a dianionic ligand, facilitating the coordination of divalent cations, otherwise difficult for the charge mismatch with pristine corroles. Pd complexes are obtained in good yields, showing interesting optical features for their practical applications.







Abstract
Alkylation of one of the inner&#8208;core nitrogen atoms is one possible approach to obtain dianionic corrole ligands, suitable for the coordination of divalent metal ions, such as PdII. Inner&#8208;core N&#8208;methylation can be obtained by treating the corrole with CH3I, but the reaction conditions should be optimized to limit the formation of the dimethylated derivative. Two regioisomers, the N&#8208;21 and the N&#8208;22 methyl derivatives are obtained from the reaction, with the first product achieved in a higher amount. Structural characterization of the reaction products evidenced the distortion induced by the introduction of the methyl groups; the N&#8208;methylcorroles are chiral compounds, and the enantiomers were separated by chromatography, with their absolute configuration assigned by ECD computation. Palladium insertion was achieved in the case of monosubstituted corroles, but not with the dimethylated macrocycle; X&#8208;ray characterization of the complexes showed the distortion of the macrocycles. The Pd complexes do not show luminescence emission, but are able to produce singlet oxygen upon irradiation. The PdII complexes were also inserted in human serum albumin (HSA) and dispersed in water; in this case, the protein protects the corroles from photobleaching, and a switch from the type II to the type I mechanism in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is observed.

The graphical abstract depicts two reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) pathways through the Jablonski diagram: the traditional thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) channel on the left with yellow sunny background and a new, cold rISC pathway on the right in blue.







Abstract
In recent years, understanding the mechanism of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) has become the primary choice for designing high&#8208;efficiency, low&#8208;cost, metal&#8208;free organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). Herein, we propose a strategically designed chalcone based donor&#8208;acceptor system, where intensification of delayed fluorescence with decrease in temperature (300&#8197;K to 100&#8197;K) is observed; the theoretical investigations of electronic states and orbital characters uncovered a new cold rISC pathway in donor&#8208;acceptor system, where rISC occurs through the down&#8208;conversation of higher triplet exciton (from T3) to lowest singlet state (S1), having negative energy splitting, thus no thermal energy is required. The comprehensive research described herein might open&#8208;up new avenues in donor&#8208;acceptor system over the conventional up&#8208;convention of triplet exciton and demonstrates that not necessarily all delayed fluorescence are thermally activated (TADF).

         <title>Atomistic&#8208;Level Effects of Noncovalent Interactions and Crystalline Packing for Organic Material Structural Integrity upon Exposure to Gamma Radiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 64, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
First atomistic&#8208;level study of organic single component and cocrystalline materials upon exposure to gamma radiation. EPR and periodic DFT calculations delineated how noncovalent interactions provide a crucial role in the structural stability of these materials upon exposure to radiation.







Abstract
Developing an atomistic understanding of ionizing radiation induced changes to organic materials is necessary for intentional design of greener and more sustainable materials for radiation shielding and detection. Cocrystals are promising for these purposes, but a detailed understanding of how the specific intermolecular interactions within the lattice upon exposure to radiation affect the structural stability of the organic crystalline material is unknown. This study evaluates atomistic&#8208;level effects of &#947; radiation on both single&#8208; and multicomponent organic crystalline materials and how specific noncovalent interactions and packing within the crystalline lattice enhance structural stability. Dose studies were performed on all crystalline systems and evaluated via experimental and computational methods. Changes in crystallinity were evaluated by p&#8208;XRD and free radical formation was analyzed via EPR spectroscopy. Type of intermolecular interactions and packing within the crystal lattice was delineated and related to the specific free radical species formed and the structural integrity of each material. Periodic DFT and HOMO&#8208;LUMO surface mapping calculations provided atomistic&#8208;level identifications of the most probable sites for the radicals formed upon exposure to &#947; radiation and relate intermolecular interactions and molecular packing within the crystalline lattice to experimental results.

         <title>Synthesis of Partially Fluorinated Alkyl Triflates by Electrochemical Fluorination (Simons Process)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 64, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrosynthesis of partially fluorinated alkyl triflates and nonaflates by using electrochemical fluorination (ECF) has been developed; it provides access to CF3SO2OCH2F and CF3SO2OCHF2 as well as their deuterated analogs. Selected ethyl triflates and nonaflates are also accessible through ECF.







Abstract
A scalable straightforward synthesis of monofluoro&#8208; and difluoromethyl triflate CF3SO2OCH2F (MH2F) and CF3SO2OCHF2 (MHF2) through electrochemical fluorination (ECF, Simons process) of methyl triflate MH3 in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride at nickel anodes is presented. The ECF method is also feasible for the preparation of the deuterated analogues CF3SO2OCD2F (MD2F) and CF3SO2OCDF2 (MD2F). Surprisingly, no H/D exchange occurs during ECF of CF3SO2OCD3 (MD3); this provides further evidence for a NiF3/NiF4&#8208;mediated ECF mechanism. The ECF of selected partially fluorinated ethyl triflates is described, and electrochemical fluorination of CF3SO2OCH2CF3 (EH2F3) leads to the until now unknown chiral CF3SO2OCHFCF3 (EHFF3). The analogous fluoromethyl and fluoroethyl nonaflates are also accessible by ECF. This study contains detailed spectroscopic, structural, and thermal data on (fluoro)methyl and fluoro(ethyl) triflates.

Honeycomb&#8208;shaped pores in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are capable of storing substantial quantities of gas, and especially porous materials with the capacity to adsorb and securely retain considerable amounts of hydrogen and carbon dioxide have attracted attention. Here, we report Zn&#8208;MOFs with triptycene&#8208;based ligands, which feature honeycomb&#8208;shaped pores that exhibit efficient storage capabilities for both carbon dioxide and hydrogen. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Sugamata, M. Minoura and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302080).

Electrochemical fluorination (ECF, Simons process) has been adopted for the preparation of partially fluorinated methyl and ethyl triflates, which are established reagents in organofluorine chemistry. The ECF process is easily scalable and only requires readily available starting compounds and electricity. Thus, it is fun to use this sustainable method for the synthesis of valuable chemicals, as highlighted by the cover picture showing molecules in Simons Fluorination Fun Park. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Finze and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302701). The cover picture was designed by Thomas Neubert.

Corroles at a looking glass: The inner&#8208;core N&#8208;methylation of a corrole can afford two monoalkylated regioisomers that are intrinsically chiral. The enantiomeric pairs have been separated by chromatography, and their absolute configuration assigned. The N&#8208;alkylation strongly influences the coordination chemistry of the corrole, making possible the preparation of divalent ion complexes, such as PdII. The photophysical properties of N&#8208;alkylcorroles are promising for future applications both as photosensitizers and catalysts. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Paolesse and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302517).

         <title>Aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;Ketene Acetals: Luminous Renaissance of a Class of Heterocyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 64, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals have experienced a renaissance from a synthetic heterocyclic peculiarity as a short dipole with strong push&#8208;pull characteristics to a promising class of dyes with pronounced controllable and tunable solid&#8208;state and aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties, thus allowing for a methodical and synthetical extension of the system.







Abstract
Aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals represent a peculiar class of heterocyclic merocyanines, compounds bearing pronounced and rather short dipoles with great push&#8208;pull characteristics that define their rich properties. They are accessible via a wide array of synthetic concepts and procedures, ranging from addition&#8208;elimination and condensation procedures up to rearrangement and metal&#8208;mediated reactions. With our work from 2020, aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals have been identified as powerful and promising dyes with pronounced and vastly tunable solid&#8208;state emission and aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties. One characteristic trademark of this class of dye molecules is the level of control that could be exerted, and which was thoroughly explored. Based on these results, the field was opened to extend the system to bi&#8208; and multichromophoric systems by the full toolkit of synthetic organic chemistry thus giving access to even more exciting properties and manifolded substance libraries capitalizing on the AIE properties. This review aims at outlining the reaction&#8208;based principles that allow for a swift and facile access to aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals, their methodical and structural evolution and the plethora of fluorescence and aggregation properties.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 64, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an attractive class of electrode materials due to their outstanding advantages, such as structural designability, good stability, and ordered pore structure. The applications of COFs in the cathode, anode, and electrolyte of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are summarized, and the relationship between the structure and electrochemical performance of COFs is elaborated.







Abstract
The development and utilization of green renewable energy are imperative with the aggravation of environmental pollution and energy crisis. In recent years, the exploration of electrochemical energy storage systems has gradually become a research hotspot in energy. Among them, aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have progressively developed into highly competitive and efficient energy storage devices owing to their inherent safety, natural abundance, and higher theoretical capacity. However, the practical application of ZIBs suffers from the limitation of challenges such as the absence of proper cathode materials and the unavoidable zinc dendrites and side reactions of Zn anode. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an attractive class of electrode materials due to their inherent advantages, like structural designability, high stability, and ordered&#8208;open channels, bestowing them with great potential to overcome the problems of ZIBs. In this review, we concentrate on the discussion of designed strategies of COFs applied to ZIBs. Furthermore, the methods of using COFs to solve the challenging problems of cathode development, anode modification, and electrolyte optimization for ZIBs are summarized. Finally, the existing difficulties, solution measures, and prospects of COFs for ZIBs applications are discussed. Our commentary hopes to serve as a valuable reference for developing COFs&#8208;based ZIBs.

         <title>Generation and Application of Homoallylic &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Diboryl Radicals via Diboron&#8208;Promoted Ring&#8208;Opening of Vinyl Cyclopropanes: cis&#8208;Diastereoselective Borylative Cycloaddition
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile access to homoallylic &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diboryl radicals has been developed by using geminal diboryl group as an activator of vinyl cyclopropane (VCP) ring opening. These boron&#8208;stabilized radicals participated in [3+2] cycloaddition reaction with a variety of alkenes to provide diboryl&#8208;cyclopentanes in a cis&#8208;diastereoselective fashion which was confirmed and rationalized by quantitative NOE and DFT studies.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;centered radicals stabilized by adjacent boron atoms are underexplored reaction intermediates in organic synthesis. This study reports the development of vinyl cyclopropyl diborons (VCPDBs) as a versatile source of previously unknown homoallylic &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diboryl radicals via thiyl radical catalyzed diboron&#8208;directed ring opening. These diboryl stabilized radicals underwent smooth [3+2] cycloaddition with a variety of olefins to provide diboryl cyclopentanes in good to excellent diastereoselectivity. In contrast to the trans&#8208;diastereoselectivity observed with most of the dicarbonyl activated VCPs, the cycloaddition of VCPDBs showed a remarkable preference for formation of cis&#8208;cyclopentane diastereomer which was confirmed by quantitative NOE and 2D NOESY studies. The cis&#8208;stereochemistry of cyclopentane products enabled a concise intramolecular Heck reaction approach to rare tricyclic cyclopentanoid framework containing the diboron group. The mild reaction conditions also allowed a one&#8208;pot VCP ring&#8208;opening, cycloaddition&#8208;oxidation sequence to afford disubstituted cyclopentanones. Control experiments and DFT analysis of reaction mechanism support a radical mediated pathway and provide a rationale for the observed diastereoselectivity. To the authors&#8217; knowledge, these are the first examples of the use of geminal diboryl group as an activator of VCP ring opening and cycloaddition reaction of &#945;&#8208;boryl radicals.

         <title>Collective Effects of Multiple Fluorine Atoms Causing &#960;&#8208;philic Characteristic within a Caged Polyoxometalate Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perfluorination brings about distinctive properties arising from the unusual nature of the F element, which have been extensively developed in materials science and chemistry. Herein we report that the construction of F&#8208;rich inner space within a hollowed Mo132O372&#160;cage ([Mo132O372(OCOR)30(water)72]42&#8208;) leads to the emergence of unique guest binding activities in encapsulation.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Perfluorination brings about distinctive properties arising from the unusual nature of the F element, which have been extensively developed in materials science and chemistry. Herein we report that the construction of F-rich inner space within a hollowed Mo132O372&#160;cage ([Mo132O372(OCOR)30(water)72]42-) leads to the emergence of unique guest binding activities in encapsulation. Prominently, the trifluoroacetate-modified cage (R = CF3,&#160;2) having as many as 90 F groups inside favours to trap cyclopentadiene (Cp), which is hardly trapped by the non-fluorinated counterpart (R = CH3,&#160;1). Systematic studies using related hydrocarbons show that the amount of the encapsulated guest is correlated with the unsaturation degree of the guests, implying the involvement of the attractive interaction of the CF3-modified interior wall with the guest &#960;-electron clouds. Control experiments using the semi-fluorinated analogues (R = CF2H, CFH2) reveal that the perfluorination is a critical factor to facilitate the Cp encapsulation by&#160;2, indicating that collective effects of polar C-F bonds spreading over the interior surface, rather than the polarity of the individual C-F bonds, are responsible.

         <title>Easy to Use DFT Approach for Computational pKa Determination of Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we propose an easy and low computational approach in computing pKa calculation with remarkable results. Our method is characterized by great accuracy and feasibility in a wide panel of substrate. Results exploited no external factor nor mathematical fitting correction, leading to a MAE values lower than 0.5. Difficult to model compounds, such as ones bearing &#8722;CN and NO2 as well as trichloro and trifluoro acetic acids were foreseen with DFT functionals without exploiting high level of theory.







Abstract
In pKa computational determination, the challenge in exploring and fostering new methodologies and approaches goes in parallel with the amelioration of computational performances. In this paper a &#8220;ready to use methodology&#8221; has been compared to other strategies, such as the re&#8208;shaping in solvation cavity (Bondi radius re&#8208;shaping), wanting to assess its reliability in predicting the pKa of a broad list of carboxylic acids. Thus, the functionals B3LYP and CAM&#8208;B3LYP have been selected, using SMD as continuum solvation model. Exploiting our previous results, two water molecules were made explicit on the reaction centre. Data show that our model (CAM&#8208;B3LYP/2H2O) is capable to accurately predict pKa, leading to mean absolute error (MAE) values lower than 0.5. Noteworthy, good results were achieved in computing the pKa of substituents bearing nitro and cyano groups. Focusing on B3LYP, eventually remarkable outputs were obtained only when Bondi correction was applied to the complex with two water molecules. Hence, massive outcomes were obtained in foreseeing the trichloro and trifluoro acetic acid pKa. These findings demonstrated that no complex level of theory nor external factor is required to accurately predict carboxylic acids pKa, with MAE well below 0.5&#8197;units.

         <title>Dynamic and Assembly Characteristics of Deep&#8208;Cavity Basket Acting as a Host for Inclusion Complexation of Mitoxantrone in Biotic and Abiotic Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep&#8208;cavity baskets are novel, accessible, modular, and biocompatible hosts. With intriguing conformational dynamics, assembly characteristics and great capacity to bind anticancer drug mitoxantrone, deep&#8208;cavity baskets hold promise for developing antidotes as a countermeasure against a broad range of aromatic toxicants in complex biological systems.







Abstract
We describe the preparation, dynamic, assembly characteristics of vase&#8208;shaped basket 13&#8722; along with its ability to form an inclusion complex with anticancer drug mitoxantrone in abiotic and biotic systems. This novel cavitand has a deep nonpolar pocket consisting of three naphthalimide sides fused to a bicyclic platform at the bottom while carrying polar glycines at the top. The results of 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), 1H&#8197;NMR Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST), Calorimetry, Hybrid Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics (REMD), and Microcrystal Electron Diffraction (MicroED) measurements are in line with 1 forming dimer [12]6&#8722;, to be in equilibrium with monomers 1(R)3&#8722; (relaxed) and 1(S)3&#8722; (squeezed). Through simultaneous line&#8208;shape analysis of 1H&#8197;NMR data, kinetic and thermodynamic parameters characterizing these equilibria were quantified. Basket 1(R)3&#8722; includes anticancer drug mitoxantrone (MTO2+) in its pocket to give stable binary complex [MTO&#8834;1]&#8722; (Kd=2.1&#8197;&#956;M) that can be precipitated in&#8197;vitro with UV light or pH as stimuli. Both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo studies showed that the basket is nontoxic, while at a higher proportion with respect to MTO it reduced its cytotoxicity in&#8197;vitro. With well&#8208;characterized internal dynamics and dimerization, the ability to include mitoxantrone, and biocompatibility, the stage is set to develop sequestering agents from deep&#8208;cavity baskets.

         <title>2&#8208;Pyridone Formation: An Efficient Method for the Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Homodimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient and operationally simple method is presented for the solid&#8208;phase synthesis of homodimeric protein ligands from a single precursor through acid&#8208; or I2/acetone&#8208;mediated formation of a 2&#8208;pyridone linkage.







Abstract
This study presents an efficient method for on&#8208;resin dimer generation through self&#8208;condensation of 3,3&#8208;dimethoxypropionic acid&#8208;modified molecules, resulting in 2&#8208;pyridones. The approach demonstrated remarkable versatility by producing homodimers of peptides, peptoids, and non&#8208;peptidic ligands. Its ease of application, broad utility, and mild reaction conditions not only hold significance for peptide and peptoid research but also offer potential for the on&#8208;resin development of a wide range of bivalent ligands.

         <title>Catalytic Synthesis of Silanols by Hydroxylation of Hydrosilanes: From Chemoselectivity to Enantioselectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Demand for structurally diverse organosilanols has been increasing, and thus this Review summarized the progress in the catalyzed synthesis of silanols via hydroxylation of hydrosilanes in the last decade, with a particular emphasis on the latest elegant developments in the desymmetrization strategy for the enantioselective synthesis of silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols from dihydrosilanes.







Abstract
As a crucial class of functional molecules in organosilicon chemistry, silanols are found valuable applications in the fields of modern science and will be a potentially powerful framework for biologically active compounds or functional materials. It has witnessed an increasing demand for non&#8208;natural organosilanols, as well as the progress in the synthesis of these structural features. From the classic preparative methods to the catalytic selective oxidation of hydrosilanes, electrochemical hydrolysis of hydrosilanes, and then the construction of the most challenging silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols. This review summarized the progress in the catalyzed synthesis of silanols via hydroxylation of hydrosilanes in the last decade, with a particular emphasis on the latest elegant developments in the desymmetrization strategy for the enantioselective synthesis of silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols from dihydrosilanes.

         <title>A Discrete, Boron&#8208;Containing Triangular Triradical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A neutral boron&#8208;containing triangular triradical based on a triptycene derivative has been synthesized. The triradical has isosceles triangle geometry due to Jahn&#8208;Teller distoration, leading to a doublet ground state. The work represents a rare example of an isolable neutral through&#8208;space triangular triradical.







Abstract
A neutral boron&#8208;containing triangular triradical based on a triptycene derivative has been designed and synthesized. Its structure, bonding and physical property have been studied by EPR spectroscopy, SQUID magnetometry and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, as well as theoretical calculations. The triradical has a series of isosceles triangle conformations in the solution due to the Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion, leading to the splitting of the two low&#8208;lying doublet states. This factor together with negligible spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) of composing light atoms quenches the spin frustration. The work represents a rare example of a neutral through&#8208;space triangular triradical.

         <title>Controllable Structural Transformation of Non&#8208;Porous Propyl&#8208;Malonate Hexakis[60]fullerene by Chloroform Uptake/Release</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new purely organic supramolecular framework based on hexakis[60]fullerene is capable of absorbing and releasing chloroform through internal structural reorganization.







Abstract
The design of dynamic structures with high recognition host&#8208;guest materials capable to host selectively small volatile molecules is an emergent field of research with both fundamental and applied implications. The challenge of exploring novel materials with advanced functionalities has led to the development of dynamic crystalline structures promoted by soft interactions. Here, a new pure organic dynamic framework based on hexakis[60]fullerene that are held together by weak van der Waals interactions is described. This crystalline structure is capable of absorbing and releasing chloroform, through internal structural reorganization. This research provides new insight into the design of organic molecular crystals for selective adsorption applications.

         <title>An In Crystallo Reaction with an Engineered Cytochrome P450 Peroxygenase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) are a class of heme&#8208;thiolate enzymes that insert oxygen into unactivated C&#8208;H bonds. These enzymes can be converted into peroxygenases via protein engineering which enables their activity to occur using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) without the requirement for additional nicotinamide co&#8208;factors or partner proteins. Here, we demonstrate that soaking crystals of an engineered P450 peroxygenase with H2O2 enables the enzymatic reaction to occur within the crystal. Crystals of the designed P450 peroxygenase, the T252E mutant of CYP199A4, in complex with 4&#8208;methoxybenzoic acid were soaked with different concentrations of H2O2 for varying times to initiate the in crystallo O&#8208;demethylation reaction. Crystal structures of T252E&#8208;CYP199A4 showed a distinct loss of electron density that was consistent with the O&#8208;demethylated metabolite, 4&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid. A new X&#8208;ray crystal structure of this enzyme with the 4&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid product was obtained to enable comparison alongside the existing substrate&#8208;bound structure. The visualisation of enzymatic catalysis in action is challenging in structural biology and the ability to intitiate the reactions of P450 enzymes, in crystallo by simply soaking crystals with H2O2 will enable new structural biology methods and techniques to be applied to study their mechanism of action.</dc:description>

         <title>Progress in&#160;Fabrication and Applications of&#160;Cholesteric&#160;Liquid Crystal Microcapsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid crystals (LCs) are well known for inherent responsiveness to external stimuli, such as light, thermal, magnetic, and electric fields. Cholesteric LCs are among the most fascinating, since they possess distinctive optical properties due to the helical molecular orientation. However, the good flow, easy contamination, and poor stability of small&#8208;molecule LCs limit their further applications, and microencapsulation as one of the most effective tools can evade these disadvantages. Microencapsulation can offer shell&#8208;core structure with LCs in the core can strengthen their stability, avoiding interference with the environment while maintaining the stimuli&#8208;responsiveness and optical properties. Here, we report recent progress in the fabrication and applications of cholesteric LC microcapsules (CLCMCs). We summarize general properties and basic principles, fabrication methods including interfacial polymerization, in&#8208;situ polymerization, complex coacervation, solvent evaporation, microfluidic and polymerization of reactive mesogens, and then give a comprehensive overview of their applications in various popular domains, including smart fabrics, smart sensor, smart displays, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, information encryption, biomedicine and actuators. Finally, we discuss the currently facing challenges and the potential development directions in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Affinity of Telluronium Chalcogen Bond Donors for Lewis Bases in Solution: A Critical Experimental&#8208;Theoretical Joint Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Telluronium salts [Ar2MeTe]X were synthesized and their Lewis acidic properties towards a number of Lewis bases were addressed in solution by physical and theoretical means. The structural X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of 21 different salts revealed the electrophilicity of the Te centers in their interactions with anions. Telluroniums&#8217; propensity to form Lewis pairs was investigated with OPPh3. Diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy suggests that telluroniums may bind up to three OPPh3 molecules. Isotherm titration calorimetry showed that the related heats of association in 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane depend on the electronic properties of the substituents of the aryl moiety and on the nature of the counterion. The enthalpies of first association of OPPh3 span &#8208;0.5 to &#8208;5 kcal/mol. The study of the affinity of telluroniums for OPPh3 by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art DFT and ab initio methods reveals the dominant Coulombic and dispersion interactions as well as an entropic effect favoring association in solution. Intermolecular orbital interactions between [Ar2MeTe]+ cations and OPPh3 are deemed insufficient to ensure alone the cohesion of [Ar2MeTe&#8226;Bn]+ complexes in solution (B= Lewis base). Comparison of Grimme&#8217;s and Tkatchenko&#8217;s DFT&#8208;D4 / MBD&#8208;vdW thermodynamics of formation of higher [Ar2MeTe&#8226;Bn]+ complexes reveals significant molecular size&#8208;dependent divergence of the two methodologies, with MBD yielding better agreement with experiment.</dc:description>

         <title>An Offset Patterned Cross&#8208;&#946; Structure in Assemblies of C3&#8208;Symmetric Peptide Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing peptide&#8208;based materials with controlled morphology represents a critical theme of soft matter research. Herein, we report the formation of a novel, patterned cross&#8208;&#946; structure formed by self&#8208;assembled C3&#8208;symmetric peptide amphiphiles based on diphenylalanine and benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA). The cross&#8208;&#946; motif is an abundant structural element in amyloid fibrils and aggregates of fibril&#8208;forming peptides, including diphenylalanine. The incorporation of topological constraints on one edge of the diphenylalanine fragment limits the number of &#946;&#8208;strands in &#946;&#8208;sheets and leads to the creation of an unconventional offset patterned cross&#8208;&#946; structure consisting of short 3x2 parallel &#946;&#8208;sheets stabilized by phenylalanine zippers. In the reported assembly, two patterned cross&#8208;&#946; structures bind parallel arrays of BTA stacks in a superstructure within a single&#8208;molecule thick nanoribbon. In addition to a threefold network of hydrogen bonds in the BTA stack, each molecule becomes simultaneously bound by hydrogen bonds of three &#946;&#8208;sheets and four phenylalanine zippers. The diffuse layer of alkyl chains with terminal polar groups prevents merging of the nanoribbons and stabilizes cross&#8208;&#946;&#8208;structure in water. Our results provide a simple approach to the incorporation of novel patterned cross&#8208;&#946; motifs into supramolecular superstructures and shed light on the general mechanism of &#946;&#8208;sheet formation in C3&#8208;symmetric peptide amphiphiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Gold&#8208;N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complexes
</title>

         <dc:description>
An electrochemical synthesis of gold(I)&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (Au&#8208;NHC) complexes has been developed in which the only by&#8208;product is hydrogen gas. This enables the clean Au&#8208;NHC complexes to be transferred directly to subsequent catalytic reactions without extra work&#8208;up. This telescoped methodology has been showcased for several mononuclear and dinuclear Au&#8208;NHC complexes in a catalytic vinylcyclopropanation reaction, delivering high yields and demonstrating procedural simplicity.







Abstract
An electrochemical synthesis of gold(I)&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (Au&#8208;NHC) complexes has been developed. The electrochemical methodology uses only imidazolium salts, gold metal electrodes, and electricity to produce these complexes with hydrogen gas as the only by&#8208;product. This high&#8208;yielding and operationally simple procedure has been used to produce eight mononuclear and three dinuclear Au&#8208;NHC complexes. The electrochemical procedure facilitates a clean reaction with no by&#8208;products. As such, Au&#8208;NHC complexes can be directly transferred to catalytic reactions without work&#8208;up or purification. The Au&#8208;NHC complexes were produced on&#8208;demand and tested as catalysts in a vinylcyclopropanation reaction. All mononuclear Au&#8208;NHC complexes performed similarly to or better than the isolated complexes.

         <title>Nucleophilicity of 4&#8208;(Alkylthio)&#8208;3&#8208;imidazoline Derived Enamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enamine activation is a key method to enhance the reactivity of carbonyl compounds in &#945;&#8208;alkylation reactions. In spite of their possible role in prebiotic chemistry, enamines derived from aldehydes and 4&#8208;(alkylthio)&#8208;3&#8208;imidazolines (TIMs) have scarcely been studied. Their reactivities have now been classified on the Mayr nucleophilicity scale by kinetic measurements. In addition, their Lewis basicities have been determined by DFT calculations and equilibrium measurements.







Abstract
Imidazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;thiones (ITOs) are cyclic, secondary amines that were considered as potential prebiotic organocatalysts for light&#8208;driven &#945;&#8208;alkylations of aldehydes by bromoacetonitrile (BAN). Recent studies showed that the initially supplied ITOs represent the pre&#8208;catalyst because they undergo S&#8208;alkylation with BAN to give 4&#8208;(alkylthio)&#8208;3&#8208;imidazolines (TIMs). Given that the same reagent mix that undergoes light&#8208;driven &#945;&#8208;alkylations is also effective in the dark, we synthesized ten ITO&#8208; or TIM&#8208;derived enamines of aldehydes and characterized their nucleophilic reactivities by kinetic studies in acetonitrile. The experimental second&#8208;order rate constants k2 for reactions of enamines with benzhydrylium ions (reference electrophiles) were evaluated by the Mayr&#8208;Patz equation, lg k2(20&#8201;&#176;C)=sN(N+E). The determined nucleophilicities N (and sN) reveal the reactivity profiles of these enamines under prebiotically relevant conditions as well as their potential for use in organocatalytic synthesis.

         <title>Probing Radical Addition to 1&#8208;Phosphabutadienes by Employing Muonium as a &#8220;Light Isotope&#8221; of Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The radical addition to 1&#8208;phosphabutadienes, Mes*P=CMe&#8722;CR=CH2 (R=H, Me) using muonium (Mu) as an H&#8208;atom analogue affords unprecedented, delocalized phosphaallylic radicals: Mes*P&#8901;&#8722;CMe=CR(CMuH2)&#8596;Mes*P=CMe&#8722;&#8901;CR(CMuH2). Structural elucidation was accomplished using muon spin spectroscopy (&#956;SR) which takes advantage of the nuclear spin properties of the Mu (Mu=&#956;++e&#8722;). This study provides important insights into the radical reactivity of low&#8208;coordinate phosphorus species, which are actively being investigated for their uses in functional macromolecule formation.







Abstract
Understanding free radical addition to multiple bonds is important to elucidating the mechanistic details of addition polymerization reactions, albeit the fleeting radical intermediates are very difficult to detect by conventional methodologies. Muon spin spectroscopy (&#956;SR) is a highly sensitive method that can detect radical species at 106 spins (cf. EPR: 1012 spins, NMR: 1018 spins). Herein, we employ &#956;SR to detect the radical&#8208;addition products from three 1&#8208;phosphabutadiene monomers, P&#8208;analogues of isoprene. We show that muonium (Mu), a &#8220;light&#8221; H&#8208;atom surrogate, adds predominantly at the C4 position of the P1=C2&#8722;C3=C4 moiety to give unprecedented 1&#8208;phosphaallyl radicals as the major products. Our structural assignments are supported by assignment of muon, phosphorus and proton hyperfine coupling constants using DFT&#8208;calculations. A minor radical product is also detected that is tentatively assigned to an PC3&#8208;heterocyclic free radical. On the basis of DFT&#8208;predictions, we speculate that its formation may involve initial addition of Mu+ at the C3 position followed by electron capture. These studies provide rare insights into the prospective radical (or cationic) polymerization of 1&#8208;phosphabutadienes, which have previously been polymerized using anionic initiation.

         <title>Advancing Gold Redox Catalysis: Mechanistic Insights, Nucleophilicity&#8208;Guided Transmetalation, and Predictive Frameworks for the Oxidation of Aryl Gold(I) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study (1) resolved a longstanding query in the field of gold redox catalysis concerning the reaction between PhICl2 and [(Ar)Au(PR3)] by unveiling the mechanism for transmetallation between gold(I) and gold(III) complexes, (2) utilized this insight to develop a predictive conceptual framework for this reaction, and (3) experimentally validated the reliability of the prediction, establishing a foundation for advancements in this field.







Abstract
Gold redox catalysis, often facilitated by hypervalent iodine(III) reagents, offers unique reactivity but its progress is mainly hindered by an incomplete mechanistic understanding. In this study, we investigated the reaction between the gold(I) complexes [(aryl)Au(PR3)] and the hypervalent iodine(III) reagent PhICl2, both experimentally and computationally and provided an explanation for the formation of divergent products as the ligands bonded to the gold(I) center change. We tackled this essential question by uncovering an intriguing transmetalation mechanism that takes place between gold(I) and gold(III) complexes. We found that the ease of transmetalation is governed by the nucleophilicity of the gold(I) complex, [(aryl)Au(PR3)], with greater nucleophilicity leading to a lower activation energy barrier. Remarkably, transmetalation is mainly controlled by a single orbital &#8211; the gold dx2&#8722;y2 orbital. This orbital also has a profound influence on the reactivity of the oxidative addition step. In this way, the fundamental mechanistic basis of divergent outcomes in reactions of aryl gold(I) complexes with PhICl2 was established and these observations are reconciled from first principles. The theoretical model developed in this study provides a conceptual framework for anticipating the outcomes of reactions involving [(aryl)Au(PR3)] with PhICl2, thereby establishing a solid foundation for further advancements in this field.

&lt;p&gt;This study (1) resolved a longstanding query in the field of gold redox catalysis concerning the reaction between PhICl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and [(Ar)Au(PR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)] by unveiling the mechanism for transmetallation between gold(I) and gold(III) complexes, (2) utilized this insight to develop a predictive conceptual framework for this reaction, and (3) experimentally validated the reliability of the prediction, establishing a foundation for advancements in this field.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold redox catalysis, often facilitated by hypervalent iodine(III) reagents, offers unique reactivity but its progress is mainly hindered by an incomplete mechanistic understanding. In this study, we investigated the reaction between the gold(I) complexes [(aryl)Au(PR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)] and the hypervalent iodine(III) reagent PhICl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, both experimentally and computationally and provided an explanation for the formation of divergent products as the ligands bonded to the gold(I) center change. We tackled this essential question by uncovering an intriguing transmetalation mechanism that takes place between gold(I) and gold(III) complexes. We found that the ease of transmetalation is governed by the nucleophilicity of the gold(I) complex, [(aryl)Au(PR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)], with greater nucleophilicity leading to a lower activation energy barrier. Remarkably, transmetalation is mainly controlled by a single orbital &#8211; the gold d&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;&#8722;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; orbital. This orbital also has a profound influence on the reactivity of the oxidative addition step. In this way, the fundamental mechanistic basis of divergent outcomes in reactions of aryl gold(I) complexes with PhICl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was established and these observations are reconciled from first principles. The theoretical model developed in this study provides a conceptual framework for anticipating the outcomes of reactions involving [(aryl)Au(PR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)] with PhICl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, thereby establishing a solid foundation for further advancements in this field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>From One&#8208;Dimensional Disordered Racemate to Ordered Racemic Conglomerates through Metal&#8208;Coordination&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly at the Liquid&#8208;Solid Interface</title>

Metal&#8208;driven transformation of a 1D disordered racemate self&#8208;assembled molecular network into a 2D racemic conglomerate metal&#8208;organic coordinated network at the solution&#8208;solid interface is described.







Abstract
In recent years, there has been significant focus on investigating and controlling chiral self&#8208;assembly, specifically in the context of enantiomeric separation. This study explores the self&#8208;assembly behavior of 4&#8208;dodecyl&#8208;3,6&#8208;di(2&#8208;pyridyl)pyridazine (DPP&#8722;C12) at the interface between heptanoic acid (HA) and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) using a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and multiscale molecular modeling. The self&#8208;assembled monolayer structure formed by DPP&#8722;C12 is periodic in one direction, but aperiodic in the direction orthogonal to it. These structures resemble 1D disordered racemic compounds. Upon introducing palladium [Pd(II)] ions, complexing with DPP&#8722;C12, these 1D disordered racemic compounds spontaneously transform into 2D racemic conglomerates, which is rationalized with the assistance of force&#8208;field simulations. Our findings provide insights into the regulation of two&#8208;dimensional chirality.

         <title>From an Isolable Bismolyl Anion to an Yttrium&#8211;Bismolyl Complex with &#956;&#8208;Bridging Bismuth(I) Centers and Polar Covalent Y&#8722;Bi Bonds</title>

         <dc:description>
In a desert oasis landscape, comprising pyramids of elemental bismuth, the first crystallographically characterized bismolyl ligand as a potassium salt is depicted. Excitingly, two of these anionic ligands bridge two yttrium metallocene cations to give the first rare&#8208;earth bismolyl complex. The lone pairs on bismuth lead to significant Y&#8722;Bi covalent bonding interactions. The yttrium bismolyl complex is redox active, portrayed through the cyclic voltammogram emerging through a sand dune. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Demir and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302687).

         <title>Highly Electrophilic Intermediates in the Bypass Mechanism of Glutathione Peroxidase: Synthesis, Reactivity, and Structures of Selenocysteine&#8208;Derived Cyclic Selenenyl Amides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cover picture shows key players in the catalytic cycle of the mammalian antioxidant enzyme, glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Selenocysteine selenenic acids (queen) and selenocysteine selenenyl sulfides (rook) are established contributors to GPx function. This study unveils a previously overlooked class of intermediates: selenocysteine cyclic selenenyl amides (king). Through model studies, their reactivity has been revealed, exhibiting dual functionality. They not only prevent the inactivation of GPx but also act as highly electrophilic intermediates in selenoprotein reactions. Their roles mirror a chess king, dynamically adapting to their application. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Goto et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302615).

         <title>Ortho&#8208;Boronic Acid Carbonyl Compounds and Their Applications in Chemical Biology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iminoboronates and diazaborines are related classes of compounds that feature an imine ortho to an arylboronic acid (iminoboronate) or a hydrazone that cyclizes with an ortho arylboronic acid (diazaborine). Rather than acting as independent chemical motifs, the arylboronic acid impacts the rate of imine/hydrazone formation, hydrolysis, and exchange with competing nucleophiles. Increasing evidence has shown that the imine/hydrazone functionality also impacts arylboronic acid reactivity toward diols and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS). Untangling the communication between C=N linked functionality and arylboronic acids has revealed a powerful and tunable motif for bioconjugation, for fluorescent probe development, and as crosslinks in stimuliresponsive materials. Here, we survey the applications of iminoboronates and diazaborines in these fields with an eye toward understanding their utility as a function of neighboring group effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling CO2 Reduction Reaction Intermediates on High Entropy Alloy Catalysts: An Interpretable Machine Learning Approach to Establish Scaling Relations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Establishment of scaling relation among the reaction intermediates is highly important but very much challenging on complex surfaces, such as surfaces of high entropy alloys (HEAs). Herein, we designed an interpretable machine learning (ML) approach to establish a scaling relation among CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) intermediates adsorbed at same adsorption site. Local Interpretable Model&#8208;Agnostic Explanations (LIME), Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) and Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) are used for the global and local interpretation of the utilized black box models. These methods are successfully applied through an iterative way and validated on CuCoNiZnMg and CuCoNiZnSn&#8208;based HEAs data. Finally, we successfully predicted adsorption energies of *H2CO (MAE: 0.24 eV) and *H3CO (MAE: 0.23 eV) using the *HCO training data. Similarly, adsorption energy of *O (MAE: 0.32 eV) is also predicted from *H training data. We believe that our proposed method can shift the paradigm of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ML in catalysis towards better interpretability.</dc:description>

In order to augment the Lewis acidity of these newly formed unsymmetrical monotellurides, these have been transformed into corresponding unsymmetrical 2&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzamide tellurium cations. Subsequently, these Lewis acidic tellurium cations were used as chalcogen bonding catalysts, enabling the synthesis of various substituted 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines by activating ketones with anilines under mild conditions. Moreover, the synthesized 2&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzamide phenyl tellurium cation has also catalyzed the formation of &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols in high regioselectivity by effectively activating epoxides at room temperature. Mechanistic insight by 1H and 19F NMR study, electrostatic surface potential (ESP map), control reaction in which tellurium cation reacted explosively with epoxide, suggested that the enhanced Lewis acidity of tellurium center seems responsible for efficient catalytic activities under mild conditions enabling &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols with excellent regioselectivity, trifluoromethyl, nitro&#8208;substituted and bidentate monoanionic 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines which were difficult to access.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigation of Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)&#8211;Plasma Membrane Interaction in Live Cells and the Influence of GPI Glycan Structure on the Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) need to interact with other components in the cell membrane to transduce transmembrane signals. A bifunctional GPI probe was employed for photoaffinity&#8208;based proximity labelling and identification of GPI&#8208;interacting proteins in the cell membrane. This probe contained the entire core structure of GPIs and was functionalized with photoreactive diazirine and clickable alkyne to facilitate its crosslinking with proteins and attachment of an affinity tag. It was disclosed that this probe was more selective than our previously reported probe containing only a part structure of the GPI core for cell membrane incorporation and an improved probe for studying GPI&#8208;cell membrane interaction. Eighty&#8208;eight unique membrane proteins, many of which are related to GPIs/GPI&#8208;anchored proteins, were identified utilizing this probe. The proteomics dataset is a valuable resource for further analyses and data mining to find new GPI&#8208;related proteins and signalling pathways. A comparison of these results with those of our previous probe provided direct evidence for the profound impact of GPI glycan structure on its interaction with the cell membrane.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional UV&#8208;NIR Dual Light&#8208;Responsive Soft Actuators from a Main&#8208;Chain Azobenzene Semi&#8208;Crystalline Poly(ester&#8208;amide) Doped with Polydopamine Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of soft photoactuators with multifunctionality and improved performance is highly important for their broad applications. Herein, we report on a facile and efficient strategy for fabricating such photoactuators with UV&#8208;NIR dual light&#8208;responsivity, room&#8208;temperature 3D shape reprogrammability and reprocessability, and photothermal healability by doping polydopamine (PDA) nanoparticles into a main&#8208;chain azobenzene semi&#8208;crystalline poly(ester&#8208;amide) (PEA). The PEA/PDA nanoparticle composite was readily processed into free&#8208;standing films with enhanced mechanical and photomechanical properties compared with the blank PEA films. Its physically crosslinked uniaxially oriented films showed rapid and highly reversible photochemically induced bending/unbending under the UV/visible light irradiation at room temperature in both the air atmosphere and water. When exposed to the NIR light, they (and their bilayer films formed with a polyimide film) exhibited photothermally induced bending even at a temperature much lower than their crystalline&#8208;to&#8208;isotropic phase transition temperature based on a unique mechanism (involving photothermally induced polymer chain relaxation due to the disruption of their hydrogen bonds). The room&#8208;temperature 3D shape reprogrammability and reprocessability and photothermal healability of the composite polymer films were also demonstrated. Such multifunctional dual light&#8208;responsive photoactuators with well&#8208;balanced mechanical robustness, actuation stability, 3D shape reprogrammability/reprocessability and photothermal healability hold much promise in various photoactuating applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Immobilizing Bimetallic RuCo Nanoalloys on Few&#8208;layered MXene as a Robust Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Doping Co atom into Ru lattices can tune the electronic structure of active sites and the conductive MXene can adjust the electrical conductivity of catalysts, which are both favorable for improving the electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst for water splitting. Here, the ruthenium&#8208;cobalt bimetallic nanoalloys coupled with exfoliated Ti3C2Tx MXene (RuCo&#8208;Ti3C2Tx) is constructed via ice&#8208;templated and thermal activation. Due to the strong interaction between RuCo nanoalloys and conductive MXene, RuCo&#8208;Ti3C2Tx not only exhibits excellent Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with a low overpotential and Tafel slope (60 mV, 34.8 mV dec&#8208;1 in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 52 mV, 38.7 mV dec&#8208;1 in 1 M KOH), but also good oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in an alkaline electrolyte (266 mV, 111.1 mV dec&#8208;1 in 1 M KOH). The assembled RuCo&#8208;Ti3C2Tx||RuCo&#8208;Ti3C2Tx electrolyzer requires a lower potential (1.56 V) than that of the Pt/C||RuO2 electrolyzer at 10 mA cm&#8208;2. The boosted catalytic HER activity by immobilizing the RuCo nanoalloys on MXene are unveiled by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This study provides a feasible and efficient strategy for developing MXene&#8208;based catalysts for overall water splitting</dc:description>

         <title>Cyano Decoration of p&#8208;Bridge to Boost Photoluminescence and Electroluminescence Quantum Yields of Triazine/carbazole Based Blue TADF Emitter</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In general, a large donor&#8208;acceptor dihedral angle is required to guarantee sufficient frontier molecular orbitals separation for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters, which is intrinsically unfavorable for the radiative transition. We present a molecular design method favoring both reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and radiative transitions even at a moderate D&#8208;A angle. A blue TADF emitter TrzBuCz&#8208;CN was designed with triazine/tert&#8208;butylcarbazole as donor/acceptor and cyano (CN) incorporated on the phenylene bridge. In comparison with the methyl decoration in similar way (TrzBuCz&#8208;Me), CN decoration reduced the D&#8208;A dihedral angle from 70&#176; to 60&#176;, which is intrinsically not favorable for sufficient FMO separation, but unexpectedly reduced the singlet and triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) and thus facilitated TADF feature by pulling down the lowest singlet state energy. While the reduced distorsion instead improved the HOMO&#8208;LUMO overlap and boosted the fluorescence quantum yield from 41% to 94%. The blue organic light&#8208;emitting diode of TrzBuCz&#8208;CN exhibited an external quantum efficiency of 13.7% with emission peak at 466 nm, greatly superior to 6.0% of TrzBuCz&#8208;Me. The result provides a feasible design strategy to facilitate both RISC and radiation processes by CN decoration of the linking bridge of TADF emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Crystallographic Structure and Metal Vacancies on the Oxygen Evolution Reaction Performance of Ni&#8208;based Layered Hydroxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nickel&#8208;based layered hydroxides (LHs) are a family of efficient electrocatalysts for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Nevertheless, fundamental aspects such as the influence of the crystalline structure and the role of lattice distortion of the catalytic sites remain poorly understood and typically muddled.&#160;Herein, we carried out a comprehensive investigation on &#593;&#8208;LH, &#946;&#8208;LH and layered double hydroxide (LDH) phases by means of structural, spectroscopical,&#160;in&#8208;silico&#160;and electrochemical studies, which suggest the key aspect exerted by Ni&#8208;vacancies in the &#593;&#8208;LH structure.&#160;Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) confirm that the presence of Ni&#8208;vacancies produces acute distortions of the electroactive Ni sites, triggering the appearance of Ni localised electronic states on the Fermi level, reducing the Egap, and&#160;consequently, increasing the reactivity of the electroactive sites&#160;in the &#593;&#8208;LH structure.&#160;Furthermore,&#160;post&#8208;mortem&#160;Raman and XAS measurements unveil its transformation into a highly reactive oxyhydroxide&#8208;like phase&#160;that remains&#160;stable under ambient conditions.&#160;Hence, this work pinpoints the critical role of the crystalline structure as well as the electronic properties of LH structures on their inherent electrochemical reactivity towards OER catalysis.&#160;We envision Ni&#8208;based &#593;&#8208;LH as a perfect platform for&#160;hosting trivalent cations,&#160;obtaining new&#160;efficient earth&#8208;abundant electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Simple Air&#8208;Stable [3]Radialene Anion Radicals as Environmentally Switchable Catholytes in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hexacyano[3]radialene radical anion (1) is an attractive catholyte material for use in redox flow battery (RFB) applications. The substitution of cyano groups with ester moieties enhances solubility while maintaining redox reversibility and favorable redox potentials. Here we show that these ester&#8208;functionalized, hexasubstituted [3]radialene radical anions dimerize reversibly in water. The dimerization mode is substitution pattern dependent and can be switched in solution. Stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior is achieved by exploiting an unprecedented tristate switching mechanism, wherein the radical can be toggled between the free radical, a &#960;&#8208;dimer, and a sigma&#8208;dimer &#8208;&#8208; each with dramatically different optical, magnetic, and redox properties &#8208;&#8208; by changing the solvent environment, temperature, or salinity. The symmetric, triester&#8208;tricyano[3]radialene (3) forms a solvent&#8208;responsive, &#963;&#8208;dimer in water that converts to the radical anion with the addition of organic solvents or to a &#960;&#8208;dimer in brine solutions. Diester&#8208;tetracyano[3]radialene (2) exists primarily as a &#960;&#8208;dimer in aqueous solutions and a radical anion in organic solvents. The dimerization behavior of both 2 and 3 is temperature dependent in solutions of methanol. Dimerization equilibrium has a direct impact on catholyte stability during galvanostatic charge&#8208;discharge cycling in static H&#8208;cells. Specifically, conditions that favor the free radical anion or &#960;&#8208;dimer exhibit significantly enhanced cycling profiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Size Determination of Organic Cages by Diffusion NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reliable structure elucidation of covalent organic cage compounds remains challenging as routine analysis might leave ambiguities. Diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) allows insight into the molecular size and mass of the species present in solution, but a systematic evaluation of the diffusion behavior for cage assemblies is rarely considered. Here we report the synthesis of four series of covalent organic cages based on tribenzotriquinacenes and diboronic acids with varying geometry and exohedral substituents. We provide a guideline for the consistent measurement of diffusion coefficients from&#160;1H&#8208;DOSY&#160;NMR, which was utilized to study the diffusion behavior for the whole set of cages and selected examples from the literature. For structurally similar cages, a linear correlation between the solvodynamic volume and the molecular mass allows precise size determination. For more complex systems, multiple parameters such as window size or rigid exohedral functionalization further modulate cage diffusion in solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Cage Match: Comparing the Anion Binding Ability of Isostructural Versus Isofunctional Pairs of Metal&#8208;Organic Nanocages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three Pt&#8208;linked porphyrin nanocages were used to examine how the structure and functionality of hosts influence their anion binding ability. Two isostructural M6L312+ cages exhibit similar high affinities (&gt;107&#8197;M&#8722;1) for aryl carboxylates and sulfonates despite the hosts differing greatly in hydrogen&#8208;bonding ability. Proton&#8208;responsive behavior was used to toggle between binding the benzoate guests and a weaker binding perfluorooctanoate anion.







Abstract
Affinities of six anions (mesylate, acetate, trifluoroacetate, p&#8208;toluenecarboxylate, p&#8208;toluenesulfonate, and perfluorooctanoate) for three related Pt2+&#8208;linked porphyrin nanocages were measured to probe the influence of different noncovalent recognition motifs (e.&#8201;g., hydrogen bonding, electrostatics, &#960; bonding) on anion binding. Two new hosts of M6L312+ (1b) and M4L28+ (2) composition (M=(en)Pt2+, L=(3&#8208;py)4porphyrin) were prepared in a one&#8208;pot synthesis and allowed comparison of hosts that differ in structure while maintaining similar N&#8722;H hydrogen&#8208;bond donor ability. Comparisons of isostructural hosts that differ in hydrogen&#8208;bonding ability were made between 1b and a related M6L312+ nanoprism (1a, M=(tmeda)Pt2+) that lacks N&#8722;H groups. Considerable variation in association constants (K1=1.6&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1 to 1.3&#215;108&#8197;M&#8722;1) and binding mode (exo vs. endo) were found for different host&#8211;guest combinations. Strongest binding was seen between p&#8208;toluenecarboxylate and 1b, but surprisingly, association of this guest with 1a was only slightly weaker despite the absence of NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions. The high affinity between p&#8208;toluenecarboxylate and 1a could be turned off by protonation, and this behavior was used to toggle between the binding of this guest and the environmental pollutant perfluorooctanoate, which otherwise has a lower affinity for the host.

         <title>Chemistry and Biology of Podophyllotoxins: An Update</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Podophyllotoxin is a natural product with interesting medicinal and agricultural values. Herein, new podophyllotoxin analogues with new skeletons isolated from plants are listed, as well as the total synthesis, structural modifications, biological activity and structure&#8211;activity relationships of podophyllotoxin and its derivatives. Hopefully, this review will serve as a reference for further research on podophyllotoxin and its derivatives.







Abstract
Podophyllotoxin is an aryltetralin lignan lactone derived from different plants of Podophyllum. It consists of five rings with four chiral centers, one trans&#8208;lactone and one aryl tetrahydronaphthalene skeleton with multiple modification sites. Moreover, podophyllotoxin and its derivatives showed lots of bioactivities, including anticancer, anti&#8208;inflammatory, antiviral, and insecticidal properties. The demand for podophyllotoxin and its derivatives is rising as a result of their high efficacy. As a continuation of our previous review (Chem. Eur. J., 2017, 23, 4467&#8211;4526), herein, total synthesis, biotransformation, structural modifications, bioactivities, and structure&#8211;activity relationships of podophyllotoxin and its derivatives from 2017 to 2022 are summarized. Meanwhile, a piece of update information on the origin of new podophyllotoxin analogues from plants from 2014 to 2022 was compiled. We hope that this review will provide a reference for future high value&#8211;added applications of podophyllotoxin and its analogues in the pharmaceutical and agricultural fields.

         <title>Prediction of Strong Solvatochromism in a Molecular Photocatalyst
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvatochromism denotes the dependence of the colour of a solution on the solvent. Based on quantum chemical calculations, we predict strong solvatochromism in a light&#8208;driven molecular photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution. Moreover, we find a solvent&#8208;dependent relocation of the highest occupied molecular orbital opening the way to deliberately modify the properties of photoactive complexes.







Abstract
Based on quantum chemical calculations, we predict strong solvatochromism in a light&#8208;driven molecular photocatalyst for hydrogen generation, that is we show that the electronic and optical properties of the photocatalyst strongly depend on the solvent it is dissolved in. Our calculations in particular indicate a solvent&#8208;dependent relocation of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Ground&#8208;state density functional theory and linear response time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations were applied in order to investigate the influence of implicit solvents on the structural, electronic and optical properties of a molecular photocatalyst. Only at high dielectric constants of the solvent, is the HOMO located at the metal center of the photosensitizer, whereas at low dielectric constants the HOMO is centered at the metal atom of the catalytically active complex. We elucidate the electronic origins of this strong solvatochromic effect and sketch the consequences of these insights for the use of photocatalysts in different environments.

         <title>CoFe Alloys Dispersed on Se, N Co&#8208;Doped Graphitic Carbon as Efficient Bifunctional Catalysts for Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CoFe/Se@CN with abundant porous structure was obtained through a self&#8208;sacrificing template method. The large specific surface area and the mesopores of CoFe/Se@CN provide rich active sites and facilitate the transport and transfer of protons and electrons. The abundant defects formed by doping Se enhance the oxygen adsorption/activation of carbon surfaces and increase active sites. Under the synergistic effect of CoFe alloys and Se, N co&#8208;doped graphitic carbon, CoFe/Se@CN exhibits excellent ORR and OER properties with an ultralow potential gap of 0.625&#8197;V.







Abstract
The development of a stable and efficient non&#8208;noble metal catalyst with both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is paramount to achieving the widespread application of Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) but remains a great challenge. Herein, a novel Co3Fe7 alloy nanoparticle dispersed on Se, N co&#8208;doped graphitic carbon (denoted as CoFe/Se@CN) was prepared through a facile hydrothermal and pyrolysis process. The synthesized CoFe/Se@CN exhibits outstanding ORR and OER properties with an ultralow potential gap of 0.625&#8197;V, which is mainly attributed to the abundant porous structure, the rich structural defects formed by doping Se atoms, and the strong synergistic effects between the CoFe alloys and graphitic carbon nanosheet. Furthermore, the ZAB fabricated by CoFe/Se@CN shows a high peak power density of 160&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a large specific capacity of 802&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 with favorable cycling stability, outperforming that of Pt/C+RuO2. Our study offers a plausible strategy to explore bifunctional carbon&#8208;based materials with efficient electrocatalytic properties for rechargeable ZABs.

         <title>High&#8208;Mannose Oligosaccharide Hemimimetics that Recapitulate the Conformation and Binding Mode to Concanavalin A, DC&#8208;SIGN and Langerin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;carbohydrate chemical mimicry&#8221; of sp2&#8208;iminosugars enables the synthesis of high&#8208;mannose&#8208;type oligosaccharide analogs whose solution and lectin bound conformations match those of the natural partners. Upon multivalent presentation, enhanced affinities towards ConA, DC&#8208;SIGN and langerin are achieved, with distinct selectivity profiles.







Abstract
The &#8220;carbohydrate chemical mimicry&#8221; exhibited by sp2&#8208;iminosugars has been utilized to develop practical syntheses for analogs of the branched high&#8208;mannose&#8208;type oligosaccharides (HMOs) Man3 and Man5. In these compounds, the terminal nonreducing Man residues have been substituted with 5,6&#8208;oxomethylidenemannonojirimycin (OMJ) motifs. The resulting oligomannoside hemimimetic accurately reproduce the structure, configuration, and conformational behavior of the original mannooligosaccharides, as confirmed by NMR and computational techniques. Binding studies with mannose binding lectins, including concanavalin A, DC&#8208;SIGN, and langerin, by enzyme&#8208;linked lectin assay and surface plasmon resonance revealed significant variations in their ability to accommodate the OMJ unit in the mannose binding site. Intriguingly, OMJMan segments demonstrated &#8220;in line&#8221; heteromultivalent effects during binding to the three lectins. Similar to the mannobiose (Man2) branches in HMOs, the binding modes involving the external or internal monosaccharide unit at the carbohydrate binding&#8208;domain exist in equilibrium, facilitating sliding and recapture processes. This equilibrium, which influences the multivalent binding of HMOs, can be finely modulated upon incorporation of the OMJ sp2&#8208;iminosugar caps. As a proof of concept, the affinity and selectivity towards DC&#8208;SIGN and langerin were adjustable by presenting the OMJMan epitope in platforms with diverse architectures and valencies.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Modulated Reversible Clustering of Gold Nanorods Driven by Small Surface Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In thermoresponsive plasmonics, size does matter: This study presents a strategy for preparing thermosensitive gold nanorods clustering reversibly over a broad temperature range and reaching interparticle gaps as small as 1&#8197;nm in the clustered state. This enables the possibility to exploit the full promise of plasmonic coupling and the generation of dynamic hotspots.







Abstract
Temperature&#8208;modulated colloidal phase of plasmonic nanoparticles is a convenient playground for resettable soft&#8208;actuators or colorimetric sensors. To render reversible clustering under temperature change, bulky ligands are required, especially if anisotropic morphologies are of interest. This study showcases thermoresponsive gold nanorods by employing small surface ligands, bis (p&#8208;sulfonatophenyl) phenyl&#8208;phosphine dihydrate dipotassium salt (BSPP) and native cationic surfactant. Temperature&#8208;dependent analysis in real&#8208;time allowed to describe the structural features (interparticle distance and cluster size) as well as thermal parameters, melting and freezing temperatures. These findings suggest that neither covalent Au&#8722;S bonds nor bulky ligands are required to obtain a robust thermoresponsive system based on anisotropic gold nanoparticles, paving the way to stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoparticles with a wide range of sizes and geometries.

         <title>Field&#8208;Assisted Regulation Induced by Cobalt&#8208;Doped ZnO for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Anodes</title>

The incorporation of Co doping induces a local electric field and built&#8208;in magnetic field, thereby facilitating electron transfer and modulating the dynamic trajectory of Li+ ions, ultimately resulting in homogeneous Li deposition.







Abstract
Lithium metal batteries are deemed as an optimal candidate for the next generation of durable energy storage devices. However, the growth of lithium dendrite and significant volume expansion pose as obstacles that impede the application of lithium metal batteries. In this work, a functional copper current collector was designed by coating it with Co&#8208;doped ZnO (Co/ZnO) to enhance the lithiophilicity through local electric fields and built&#8208;in magnetic fields induced by the ferromagnetic material. The incorporation of Co not only induces a local electric field and thus accelerating electron transfer, but also imparts the ferromagnetic behavior to ZnO, resulting in an internal magnetic field to regulate the dynamic trajectory. Profiting from the above advantages, the symmetric cells have excellent cycle stability in 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, maintaining ultra&#8208;low voltage for over 2000&#8197;h. This study provides a realizable pathway for next&#8208;generation current collector of copper modification.

         <title>Underwater Adhesives from Redox&#8208;Responsive Polyplexes of Thiolated Polyamide Polyelectrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Redox&#8208;responsive underwater adhesives exhibiting high optical transparency, biodegradability and strong adhesion of biological substrates were prepared from polyplexes of oppositely charged partially&#8208;thiolated polyamide polyelectrolytes (TPEs).







Abstract
We report the fabrication of optically clear underwater adhesives using polyplexes of oppositely charged partially&#8208;thiolated polyamide polyelectrolytes (TPEs). The thiol content of the constituent PEs was varied to assess its influence on the adhesive properties of the resulting glues. These catechol&#8208;free, redox&#8208;responsive TPE&#8208;adhesives were formulated in aquo and exhibited high optical transparency and strong adhesion even on submerged or moist surfaces of diverse polar substrates such as glass, aluminium, wood, and bone pieces. The adhesives could be cured under water through oxidative disulphide crosslinking of the constituent TPEs. The polyamide backbone provided multi&#8208;site H&#8208;bonding interactions with the substrates while the disulphide crosslinking provided the cohesive strength to the glue. Strong adhesion of mammalian bones (load bearing capacity upto 7&#8197;kg/cm2) was achieved using the adhesive containing 30&#8197;mol&#8201;% thiol residues. Higher pH and use of oxidants such as povidone&#8208;iodine solution enhanced the curing rate of the adhesives, and so did the use of Tris buffer instead of Phosphate buffer. The porous architecture of the adhesive and its progressive degradation in aqueous medium over the course of three weeks bode well for diverse biomedical applications where temporary adhesion of tissues is required.

         <title>Boosting the Oxygen Evolution Activity of FeNi Oxides/Hydroxides by Molecular and Atomic Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiFe materials are the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts for water oxidation, therefore, fine tuning their properties is the cornerstone to achieving more active and efficient catalysts. In this concept, we will review the recently emerged strategies to engineer them molecularly and atomically by introducing different vacancies, incorporating single atoms or by ligand functionalization.







Abstract
FeNi oxides/hydroxides are the best performing catalysts for oxidizing water at basic pH. Consequently, their improvement is the cornerstone to develop more efficient artificial photosynthetic systems. During the last 5&#8197;years different reports have demonstrated an enhancement of their activity by engineering their structures via: (1)&#8197;modulation of the number of oxygen, iron and nickel vacancies; (2)&#8197;single atoms (SAs) doping with metals such as Au, Ir, Ru and Pt; and (3)&#8197;modification of their surface using organic ligands. All these strategies have led to more active and stable electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution rection (OER). In this Concept, we critically analyze these strategies using the most relevant examples.

         <title>Engineering a Cl&#8722;&#8208;Modulated Light&#8208;Driven Na+ Pump</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microbial Na+&#8208;pumping rhodopsin (NaR) is a promising optogenetic tool due to its unique ability to transport Na+. We have developed a novel chemical modulation mode for NaR that goes beyond light control by introducing a potential Cl&#8722; binding site (Gln160). The increase in [Cl&#8722;] accelerates the uptake of Na+ and enhances Na+ transport activity. This Cl&#8722;&#8208;modulated NaR shows promise for potential applications in optogenetic therapies for related neurological diseases. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Chen and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302543).

         <title>An Iron Macrocyclic Complex Containing Four &#8220;Hybrid&#8221; Pyridinium Amidate/Amidate N&#8208;Donors as a Catalyst for Oxidations with Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The depicted macrocyclic iron complex is a highly active, biomimetic oxidation catalyst in water at pH&#8197;7. The iron centre is coordinated by four unique, hybrid, pyridinium amidate/amidate nitrogen donors. Upon activation by the green oxidant hydrogen peroxide, the iron complex is converted to an aggressive intermediate (represented by the piranha) that very rapidly oxidises the surrogate pollutant orange&#8197;II to colourless products, with the iron returning to its FeIII resting state. More information can be found in the Research Article by L.&#8197;J. Wright and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301548).

         <title>Poly(arylene iminoborane)s, Analogues of Poly(arylene vinylene) with a BN&#8208;Doped Backbone: A Comprehensive Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid polymers with a BN&#8208;doped backbone have been developed using a modular synthetic approach. By combining various building blocks (i.e., the puzzle pieces), p&#8208;conjugated polymers and monodisperse oligomers with modulated properties, including solid&#8208;state and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) at tailored wavelengths, can be accessed. This is illustrated by the polymer sequence and the background color, depending on the incorporated building blocks that were put together. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Helten et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302767).

         <title>Advances in Inorganic Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte/Li Interface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The demand for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and high&#8208;safety energy storage devices has inspired increased interest in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs). An outstanding inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolyte (ISE) is a fundamental requirement for ASSLMBs, and a well&#8208;performing ISE/Li interface is a key factor in achieving high&#8208;performance ASSLMBs. In this concept, we first summarize the dilemmas ISE/Li interfaces face and outline four strategies commonly used for ISE/Li interfacial modification. Then, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the coatings being used as ISE/Li interfacial phases, as well as the commonly used thermal bonding and the new cold bonding methods used for in situ interface preparation. Finally, future directions for functionalizing ISE interfaces and achieving high&#8208;performance ASSLMBs are highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Customized Synthesis of MOF Nanoplates via Molecular Scalpel Strategy for Efficient Oxygen Reduction in Zn&#8722;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D MOF nanoplates from a layer&#8208;pillared 3D MOF is achieved, via a molecular scalpel strategy, by utilizing pyridine to replace 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine. The morphology can be modified from hexagonal nanorods to nanoplates with controllable thickness tuned by the amounts of pyridine. The annealed nanoplates display high ORR activity (0.88&#8197;V).







Abstract
The production of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanoplates with well&#8208;defined geometric morphology is remarkable for expanding their applications. Herein, the cobalt&#8208;based MOF nanoplates with hexagonal channels from a layer&#8208;pillared MOF are accomplished, via a molecular scalpel strategy, utilizing monodentate pyridine to replace the bidentate 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine. The morphology can be modified from nanorods to nanoplates with controllable thickness tuned by the amounts of pyridine. Succeeding carbonization treatment transforms the MOF nanoplates into Co particles homogeneously encapsulated in the nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon layers. The prepared catalyst with a unique platelike morphology displays a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.88&#8197;V in oxygen reduction reaction. When used in primary Zn&#8722;air batteries, it delivers a high peak power density of 280&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work clarifies the structure&#8208;morphology&#8208;reactivity connection of MOF nanoplates.

         <title>The Field of Main Group Lewis Acids and Lewis Superacids: Important Basics and Recent Developments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Essential basics of Donor&#8208;Acceptor (DA) interactions are presented to emphasize vital role of the Lewis acidity from weak intermolecular interactions to the strong DA complexes. Recent advances in synthesis and characterization of novel Lewis acids and Lewis superacids of group&#8197;2, 13, 14, and 15 elements are presented and discussed.







Abstract
New developments in the field of Lewis acidity are highlighted, with the focus of novel Lewis acids and Lewis superacids of group&#8197;2, 13, 14, and 15 elements. Several important basics, illustrated by modern examples (classification of Donor&#8208;Acceptor (DA) complexes, amphoteric nature of any compound in terms of DA interactions, reorganization energies of main group Lewis acids and the role of the energies of frontier orbitals) are presented and discussed. It is emphasized that the Lewis acidity phenomena are general and play vital role in different areas of chemistry: from weak &#8220;atomophilic&#8221; interactions to the complexes of Lewis superacids.

         <title>Exploration of the Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Sydnone and Sydnonimine&#8208;Alkyne Cycloaddition Reactions by High&#8208;Throughput Experimentation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;Throughput&#8208;Experimentation has been used to revisit the Cu&#8208;catalyzed Sydnone&#8208;Alkyne Cycloaddition reaction. The reaction has been improved and a new click&#8208;and&#8208;release reaction has been discovered.







Abstract
The reactivity of sydnones and sydnonimines toward terminal alkynes under copper catalysis has been explored using High&#8208;Throughput&#8208;Experimentation. A large panel of ligands and reaction conditions have been tested to optimize the copper&#8208;catalyzed sydnone click reaction discovered by our group ten years ago. This screening approach led to the identification of new ligands, which boosted the catalytic properties of copper and allowed the discovery of a new copper&#8208;catalyzed click&#8208;and&#8208;release reaction involving sydnonimines. This reaction allowed chemoselective ligation of terminal alkynes with sydnonimines and, simultaneously, the release of an isocyanate fragment molecule that can be used for further transformations.

         <title>Regular Arrays of Rod&#8208;Shaped Molecular Photoswitches: Synthesis, Preparation, Characterization, and Selective Photoswitching within Mono&#8208; and Bilayer Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regular two&#8208;dimensional arrays made of stimuli&#8208;responsive molecules represent a unique class of smart materials with a wide range of applications. We assembled photoresponsive mono&#8208; and bilayer systems with well&#8208;defined properties from rod&#8208;shaped molecules equipped with different photoswitches. Using properly chosen chromophores, we then selectively targeted layers made of the same types of photoswitches using appropriate monochromatic light.







Abstract
We assembled photoresponsive mono&#8208; and bilayer systems with well&#8208;defined properties from rod&#8208;shaped molecules equipped with different photoswitches. Using properly chosen chromophores (diarylethene&#8208;based switch and unidirectional light&#8208;driven molecular motor), we then selectively targeted layers made of the same types of photoswitches using appropriate monochromatic light. UV&#8208;vis analysis confirmed smooth and unrestricted photoisomerization. To achieve this, we synthesized a new class of triptycene&#8208;based molecular pedestals adept at forming sturdy Langmuir&#8208;Blodgett films on a water&#8208;air interface. The films were smoothly transferred to gold and quartz surfaces. Repeated deposition afforded bilayer systems: one layer containing diarylethene&#8208;based photoswitches and the other a unidirectional light&#8208;driven molecular motor. Structural analysis of both mono&#8208; and bilayer systems revealed the molecules to be tilted with carboxylic functions pointing to the surface. At least two different polymorphs differing in monolayer thickness and tilt angle (~40&#176; and ~60&#176;) were identified on the gold surface.

         <title>Fluorogen&#8208;Functionalized Mesoporous Silica Hybrid Sensing Materials: Applications in Cu2+ Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent mesoporous silica materials (FMSMs) exhibit a series of significant advantages in sensing. FMSMs&#8208;based Cu2+ sensors have been well developed and widely applied in environmental and biological fields. In this review, the preparation methodologies, sensing mechanisms, and applications in solutions and biospecimens of FMSMs&#8208;based Cu2+ sensors are summarized and discussed in detail.







Abstract
Since Cu2+ ions play a pivotal role in both ecosystems and human health, the development of a rapid and sensitive method for Cu2+ detection holds significant importance. Fluorescent mesoporous silica materials (FMSMs) have garnered considerable attention in the realm of chemical sensing, biosensing, and bioimaging due to their distinctive structure and easily functionalized surfaces. As a result, numerous Cu2+ sensors based on FMSMs have been devised and extensively applied in environmental and biological Cu2+ detection over the past few decades. This review centers on the recent advancements in the methodologies for preparing FMSMs, the mechanisms underlying sensing, and the applications of FMSMs&#8208;based sensors for Cu2+ detection.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fluorescent mesoporous silica materials (FMSMs)&lt;/b&gt; exhibit a series of significant advantages in sensing. FMSMs-based Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensors have been well developed and widely applied in environmental and biological fields. In this review, the preparation methodologies, sensing mechanisms, and applications in solutions and biospecimens of FMSMs-based Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensors are summarized and discussed in detail.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions play a pivotal role in both ecosystems and human health, the development of a rapid and sensitive method for Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; detection holds significant importance. Fluorescent mesoporous silica materials (FMSMs) have garnered considerable attention in the realm of chemical sensing, biosensing, and bioimaging due to their distinctive structure and easily functionalized surfaces. As a result, numerous Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensors based on FMSMs have been devised and extensively applied in environmental and biological Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; detection over the past few decades. This review centers on the recent advancements in the methodologies for preparing FMSMs, the mechanisms underlying sensing, and the applications of FMSMs-based sensors for Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; detection. Lastly, we present and elucidate pertinent perspectives concerning FMSMs-based Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Binding Properties of Small Electrophilic Anions [B6X5]&#8722; and [B10X9]&#8722; (X=Cl, Br, I): Activation of Small Molecules Based on &#960;&#8208;Backbonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small electrophilic anions [B6X5]&#8722; and [B10X9]&#8722; (X=Cl, Br, I) can bind and activate N2 and CO by performing &#960;&#8208;backdonation. This bond type is predicted by energy decomposition analysis and experimentally observed by the red shift of the bound N2/CO stretching frequency.







Abstract
Superelectrophilic anions constitute a special class of molecular anions that show strong binding of weak nucleophiles despite their negative charge. In this study, the binding characteristics of smaller gaseous electrophilic anions of the types [B6X5]&#8722; and [B10X9]&#8722; (with X=Cl, Br, I) were computationally and experimentally investigated and compared to those of the larger analogues [B12X11]&#8722;. The positive charge of vacant boron increases from [B6X5]&#8722; via [B10X9]&#8722; to [B12X11]&#8722;, as evidenced by increasing attachment enthalpies towards typical &#963;&#8208;donor molecules (noble gases, H2O). However, this behavior is reversed for &#963;&#8208;donor&#8211;&#960;&#8208;acceptor molecules. [B6Cl5]&#8722; binds most strongly to N2 and CO, even more strongly than to H2O. Energy decomposition analysis confirms that the orbital interaction is responsible for this opposite trend. The extended transition state natural orbitals for chemical valence method shows that the &#960;&#8208;backdonation order is [B6X5]&#8722;&gt;[B10X9]&#8722;&gt;[B12X11]&#8722;. This predicted order explains the experimentally observed red shifts of the CO and N2 stretching fundamentals compared to those of the unbound molecules, as measured by infrared photodissociation spectroscopy. The strongest red shift is observed for [B6Cl5N2]&#8722;: 222&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Therefore, strong activation of unreactive &#963;&#8208;donor&#8211;&#960;&#8208;acceptor molecules (commonly observed for cationic transition metal complexes) is achieved with metal&#8208;free molecular anions.

The artwork shows Kyiv's night in the heart of the city &#8211; Maidan Nezalezhnosti (central square of independence). A set of stellanes, like stars in the sky, can illuminate the way through the darkness of night, similar to science can drive us through the darkness of ignorance. The results reported in the manuscript demonstrate how a deeper understanding of the reaction's nature can help scientific developments shed light on regioselectivity, efficacy and productivity. The authors thank their colleague and very talented photographer, Mr. Andrii Yakymenko, for the original photo. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. M. Volochnyuk and S. V.

Abstract
A pair of isomers, IDT&#8208;BOF containing S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O/F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H noncovalently configurational locks and IDT&#8208;BFO containing F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H/O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H noncovalently configurational locks, with an acceptor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) structure have been designed and synthesized by choosing 4,9&#8208;dihydro&#8208;s&#8208;indaceno[1,2&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;5,6&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene (IDT) as the D unit, an F/n&#8208;hexyloxy substituted phenyl ring as &#960; bridge, and 3&#8208;(dicyanomethylidene)indan&#8208;1&#8208;one as the A unit. Owing to the S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O/F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H or F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H/O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H noncovalently configurational locks, both IDT&#8208;BOF and IDT&#8208;BFO have a completely planar structure. IDT&#8208;BOF exhibits a similar LUMO to IDT&#8208;BFO, but higher HOMO energy levels, leading to a smaller optical bandgap and red&#8208;shifted absorption. However, IDT&#8208;BOF&#8208;based bulk&#8208;heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ&#8208;OSCs) coupled with PBDB&#8208;T, and PCE&#8208;10 as donor materials both exhibited a lower PCE than that of IDT&#8208;BFO (PBDB&#8208;T: 5.2 vs. 6.1&#8201;%; PCE&#8208;10: 1.7 vs. 3.2&#8201;%). Comprehensively comparing and investigating IDT&#8208;BOF&#8201;:&#8201;PBDB&#8208;T and IDT&#8208;BFO&#8201;:&#8201;PBDB&#8208;T OSCs suggested that the large phase separation and serious charge recombination of IDT&#8208;BOF&#8208;based OSCs contributed to its lower power conversion efficiency. Importantly, ternary solar cells based on PBDB&#8208;T&#8201;:&#8201;Y5 as control devices with an additional 10&#8201;% IDT&#8208;BFO exhibited a 5&#8201;% enhancement in the PCE compared to the control device (14.3 vs. 13.46&#8201;%).

         <title>A Metal&#8208;free and Operationally Simple Radical Trifluoromethylative Borylation of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein describe a protocol to synthesize trifluoromethyl boronates from alkenes by the mutual activation of the Togni II reagent and the bis(catecholato)diboron reagent in the absence of any catalyst and additives. This reaction enables synthesizing a series of trifluoromethyl alkyl boronates using unactivated alkenes, including natural products and drug derivatives, in a regioselective manner. Moreover, the synthetic utility of the boronic ester present in the product allows access to a range of trifluoromethyl containing compounds. The radical trapping and gas detection experiments reveal that the more Lewis acidic diboron reagent determines the rapid formation of trifluoromethyl and boron centered radicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Glycerol Oligomerization over Titania&#8208;Based Catalyst Compositions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The possibility of using TiO2&#8208;based compositions: individual and sulfated titania, and their composites with carbon nanotubes as catalysts for glycerol oligomerization has been displayed. The effect of modification of TiO2 with sulfur and carbon nanotubes on acid&#8208;base and catalytic characteristics in the glycerol conversion was investigated. The activation of glycerol on the catalysts has been studied using attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR&#8208;FTIR) spectroscopy. Only the samples based on sulfated titania are active over glycerol transformation, showing up to 58.7% conversion. This is explained by the presence of strong base sites. Glycerides up to pentaglycerides, both linear and nonlinear structure are formed by glycerol oligomerization over TiO2&#8208;S. The addition of nanotubes to the catalyst`s reduces both the glycerol conversion (up to 10.5%) and the yield of glycerides. However, the spectrum of the resulting products is significantly narrowed, increasing the selectivity for short&#8208;chain glycerides: the portion of diglycerides reaches 72%, and triglycerides 21%. Herewith, glycerides of a linear structure only formed.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperation between p&#8208;Block Elements and Redox&#8208;Active Ligands: Stoichiometric and Catalytic Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The relevance acquired by redox&#8208;active ligands in modern catalysis stems from their facile delivery and acceptance of electrons, either to the metal they coordinate or directly to an incoming substrate that also binds the central metal. Doing that, they generate coordinated radicals and provide access to more than one spin state during the catalytic cycle. As consequence, the new reaction barriers get reduced when compared to similar processes that are restricted to a single spin surface. The principles that govern this genuine approach to catalyst design are well&#8208;established, and their implementation has allowed the development of synthetically useful catalytic transformations; however, the extension of the concept to species in which p&#8208;block elements take the role of central atoms remains largely underdeveloped. Through the discussion of the key achievements and recent progress, this Concept Article highlights this original approach to design (organo)catalysts, discloses the progress achieved, and also reveals the many shortcomings still existing in the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Supported Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Separation and reuse of the catalytically active metal complexes are persistent issues in homogeneous catalysis. Supported Ionic Liquid Phase (SILP) catalysts, where the catalytic center is dissolved in a thin film of a stable ionic liquid, deposited on a solid support, present a promising alternative. However, the dissolution of the metal center in the film leaves little control over its position and its activity. We present here four novel, task&#8208;specific ionic liquids [FPhnImHR]I (n&#8201;=&#8201;1, 2; R&#8201;=&#8201;PEG2, C12H25), designed to self&#8208;assemble on a silica surface without any covalent bonding and offering a metal binding site in a controlled distance to the support. Advanced multinuclear solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopic techniques under Magic Angle Spinning, complemented by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, allow us to determine their molecular conformation when deposited inside SBA&#8208;15 as a model silica support. We provide here conceptual proof for a rational design of Ionic Liquids self&#8208;assembling into thin films, opening an avenue for a second, improved generation of SILP catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>A new look at the mechanism of cocrystal formation and coformers exchange in processes forced by mechanical and/or thermal stimuli &#8208; ex situ and in situ studies of low&#8208;melting eutectic mixtures.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three different devices: ball&#8208;mill, hot stage melting, and magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR rotor were used for the preparation of ethenzamide (ET) cocrystals with glutaric acid (GLU), ethylmalonic acid (EMA) and maleic acid (MAL) as coformers. The common features of the solvent&#8208;free methods of cocrystal formation (grinding, melting) are presented on the basis of arguments obtained by solid state NMR spectroscopy. Thermal analysis proved that the eutectic phase arises over a wide range of molar ratios of components for each binary system. Experimental and theoretical methods allowed to provide details about the pathway of the reaction mechanism. It was found that the formation of ET cocrystals is a complex process that requires five steps. Variable temperature 1D and 2D MAS NMR experiments allowed to track physico&#8208;chemical processes taking place in a molten state. Moreover, it was found that in a multicomponent mixture consisting of ET, EMA, GLU, and MAL, ET in the molten phase behaves as a specific selector choosing only one partner to form binary cocrystals according to energy preferences. The stabilization energies (Estab) and molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps computed for the cocrystals and their individual components rationalize the selection rules and explain the relationships between individual species.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Potential of the Fused Heterocycle&#8208;Based Triarylhydrazone Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triarylhydrazones represent an attractive class of photochromic compounds offering many interesting features including the high molar absorptivity, good addressability, and extraordinary thermal stability. In addition, unlike most of other hydrazone&#8208;based photoswitches they effectively absorb the light above 365&#160;nm. However, previously prepared triaryhydrazones suffer from low quantum yields of the &#119885;&#8594;&#119864; photoisomerization. Herein, we designed a new subclass of naphtoyl&#8208;benzothiazole hydrazones that balance the most beneficial features of previously reported naphthoyl&#8208;quinoline and benzoyl&#8208;pyridine triarylhydrazones. These preserve the attractive absorption characteristics, exhibit higher thermal stability of the metastable form than the former and enhance the rate of the &#119885;&#8594;&#119864; photoisomerization compared to the later, as a result of the weakening of the intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the hydrazone hydrogen and the benzothiazole moiety. The introducing of the benzothiazole motif extends the tunability of photochromic behaviour of hydrazone&#8208;based switches.</dc:description>

         <title>Acyclic Boryl Complexes of Copper(I)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ring&#8208;expanded NHC, 6&#8208;Dipp ((6&#8208;Dipp=C{NDippCH2}2CH2, Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)), has been shown to support two acyclic boryls. Reaction of (6&#8208;Dipp)CuOtBu with B2(OMe)4 provided access to (6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)2, the first acyclic boryl of copper, which was shown to react similarly to its cyclic cousins. Remarkably, however, it could also be subjected to salt metathesis to access (6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)NMe2, the second acyclic boryl of copper.







Abstract
Reaction of (6&#8208;Dipp)CuOtBu (6&#8208;Dipp=C{NDippCH2}2CH2, Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) with B2(OMe)4 provided access to (6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)2 via &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis. (6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)2 was characterised by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography and shown to be a monomeric acyclic boryl of copper. (6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)2 reacted with ethylene and diphenylacetylene to provide insertion compounds into the Cu&#8208;B bond which were characterised by NMR spectroscopy in both cases and X&#8208;ray crystallography in the latter. It was also competent in the rapid catalytic deoxygenation of CO2 in the presence of excess B2(OMe)4. Alongside &#960;&#8208;insertion, (6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)2 reacted with LiNMe2 to provide a salt metathesis reaction at boron, giving (6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)NMe2, a second monomeric acyclic boryl, which also cuproborated diphenylacetylene. Computational interrogation validated these acyclic boryl species to be electronically similar to (6&#8208;Dipp)CuBpin.

&lt;p&gt;A ring-expanded NHC, 6-Dipp ((6-Dipp=C{NDippCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Dipp=2,6-iPr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)), has been shown to support two acyclic boryls. Reaction of (6-Dipp)CuOtBu with B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OMe)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; provided access to (6-Dipp)CuB(OMe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the first acyclic boryl of copper, which was shown to react similarly to its cyclic cousins. Remarkably, however, it could also be subjected to salt metathesis to access (6-Dipp)CuB(OMe)NMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the second acyclic boryl of copper.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaction of (6-Dipp)CuOtBu (6-Dipp=C{NDippCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Dipp=2,6-iPr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) with B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OMe)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; provided access to (6-Dipp)CuB(OMe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via &#963;-bond metathesis. (6-Dipp)CuB(OMe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was characterised by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography and shown to be a monomeric acyclic boryl of copper. (6-Dipp)CuB(OMe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacted with ethylene and diphenylacetylene to provide insertion compounds into the Cu-B bond which were characterised by NMR spectroscopy in both cases and X-ray crystallography in the latter. It was also competent in the rapid catalytic deoxygenation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the presence of excess B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OMe)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Alongside &#960;-insertion, (6-Dipp)CuB(OMe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacted with LiNMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to provide a salt metathesis reaction at boron, giving (6-Dipp)CuB(OMe)NMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a second monomeric acyclic boryl, which also cuproborated diphenylacetylene. Computational interrogation validated these acyclic boryl species to be electronically similar to (6-Dipp)CuBpin.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Halogen Bonding Tripodal Metallo&#8208;Receptors for Phosphate Recognition and Sensing in Aqueous&#8208;Containing Organic Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of tris(iodotriazole)&#8208;containing halogen bonding (XB) tripodal ZnII metallo&#8208;receptors, strategically designed for tetrahedral anion guest binding, are demonstrated to selectively recognise inorganic phosphate over more basic, mono&#8208;charged oxoanions and the halides in aqueous solvent media. The XB metallo&#8208;receptors display augmented anion affinities compared to their tris(prototriazole)&#8208;containing hydrogen bonding (HB) counterparts. The attachment of redox&#8208;active ferrocene moieties at the XB and HB tripodal receptor termini facilitated complementary electrochemical anion sensing capability.







Abstract
The anion recognition and electrochemical anion&#8208;sensing properties of halogen&#8208;bonding (XB) tripodal zinc(II) receptors strategically designed and constructed for tetrahedral anion guest binding are described. The XB tris(iodotriazole)&#8208;containing hosts exhibit high affinities and selectivities for inorganic phosphate over other more basic, mono&#8208;charged oxoanions such as acetate and the halides in a competitive CD3CN/D2O (9&#8201;:&#8201;1 v/v) aqueous solvent mixture. 1H&#8197;NMR anion binding and electrochemical voltammetric anion sensing studies with redox&#8208;active ferrocene functionalised metallo&#8208;tripodal receptor analogues, reveal each of the XB tripods as superior anion complexants when compared to their tris(prototriazole)&#8208;containing, hydrogen bonding (HB) counterparts, not only exemplifying the halogen bond as a strong alternative interaction to the traditional hydrogen bond for molecular recognition but also providing rare evidence of the ability of XB receptors to preferentially bind the &#8220;harder&#8221; phosphate oxoanion over the &#8220;softer&#8221; and less hydrated halides in aqueous containing media.

         <title>Robust Spin Liquidity in 2D Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Cu3(HHTP)2 with S = &#189; Kagome Lattice</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>On the one hand electron or hole doping of quantum spin liquid (QSL) may unlock high&#8208;temperature superconductivity and on the other hand it can disrupt the spin liquidity giving rise to a magnetically ordered ground state. Recently, a 2D MOF, Cu3(HHTP)2&#160;(HHTP &#8208; 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene), containing Cu(II) S = &#189; frustrated spins in the Kagome lattice is emerging as a promising QSL candidate. Herein, we present an elegant in situ redox&#8208;chemistry strategy of anchoring Cu3(HHTP)2&#160;crystallites onto diamagnetic reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets, resulting in the formation of electron&#8208;doped Cu3(HHTP)2&#8208;rGO composite which exhibited semiconducting behavior (5 K to 300 K) with high electrical conductivity of 70 S&#8729;m&#8208;1&#160;and a carrier density of ~1.1 &#215; 1018&#160;cm&#8208;3&#160;at 300 K. Remarkably, no magnetic transition in the Cu3(HHTP)2&#8208;rGO composite was observed down to 1.5 K endorsing the robust spin liquidity of the 2D MOF Cu3(HHTP)2. Specific heat capacity measurements led to the estimation of the residual entropy values of 28% and 34% of the theoretically expected value for the pristine Cu3(HHTP)2&#160;and Cu3(HHTP)2&#8208;rGO composite, establishing the presence of strong quantum fluctuations down to 1.5 K (two times smaller than the value of the exchange interaction J).</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Push&#8208;Pull Effect in Acenes, Polyenes and Polyynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Substituent effects (SEs) are fundamental for predicting molecular reactivity, while polyene, polyyne and acene derivatives are precursors to compounds with diverse applications. Computations were performed for Y&#8208;R&#8208;X systems, where reaction sites Y = NO2 and O&#8722;, substituents X = NO2, CN, Cl, H, OH, NH2, and spacers R = polyene, polyyne (n=1&#8208;5, 10 repeating units) and acene (up to tetracene). The cSAR (charge of the substituent active region) approach allowed to present, for the first time, quantitative relations describing the spacer&#8217;s electron&#8208;donating and withdrawing properties as a function of n and the spacer type. The electronic properties of the X substituents depend on the type of spacer, its length and the Y group, which is an example of the reverse SE. To describe how the SE between Y and X weakens with n, two approaches were compared: cSAR and SESE (SE stabilization energy). The EDDB (electron density of delocalized bonds) characterize changes in electron delocalization in spacers due to the SE. A new approach &#8211; EDDB differential maps &#8211; allow to extract the effect of X substitution on the electron delocalization. The charges at spacer&#8217;s C atoms correlate with cSAR; changes in the slopes confirm the charge transfer by resonance.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cyclotriveratrylene Solvent Dependent Chiral Switch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral molecular switches are attracting attention as they could pave the way to chiral molecular machines. Herein, we report on the design and synthesis of a single molecule chiral switch based on a cyclotriveratrylene scaffold, in which the chirality inversion is controlled by the solvent. Hemicryptophanes are built around a C3 cyclotriveratrylene chiral unit, with either M or P handedness, connected to another tripod and usually displaying an &#8220;out&#8221; configuration. Here, we demonstrate that solvents are able to control the &#8220;in&#8221; and &#8220;out&#8221; configurations of the CTV unit, creating a molecular switch from (M/P)&#8221;in&#8221; to (P/M)&#8221;out&#8221; handedness. The full characterization of the &#8220;in&#8221; and &#8220;out&#8221; configurations and of the chirality switch were made possible by combining NMR, HPLC, ECD, DFT and molecular dynamics. Interestingly, bulky aromatic solvents such as 2&#8208;t&#8208;butylphenol favor the &#8220;in&#8221; configuration while polar aprotic solvents such as acetone favor the &#8220;out&#8221; configuration. This switch was found to be fully reversible allowing the system to oscillate between two different M and P configurations several times upon the action of solvents stimuli.</dc:description>

         <title>Dihydroguaiazulenide Complexes and Catalysts of Group 8&#8208;12 Transition Metals: Ligands from Renewable Feedstock Replace, even Outmatch Petrochemical Based Cyclopentadienyl Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present an in&#8208;depth study of the sterically demanding Cp synthon (8&#8208;H&#8208;GuaH)Li isolated from natural product guaiazulene as a ligand transfer reagent towards late transition metal complex precursors. The synthesis and full characterization of selected, essentially unexplored homo&#8208; and heteroleptic 8&#8208;H&#8208;guaiazulenide complexes of iron, ruthenium, cobalt, rhodium, platinum, copper and zinc are discussed in detail. In order to demonstrate their potential in catalytic applications, [(GuaH)PtMe3] was selected. The latter proved an even higher catalytic activity in light induced olefin hydrosilylation at catalyst loads as low as 5 ppm than classical [CpPtMe3] in a typical test reaction of silicone elastomer fabrication. Our results demonstrate that traditional petrochemical based Cp metal chemistry and catalysis can be replaced, sometimes even outmatched by superior catalysts based on cheap building blocks from renewable feedstock.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur&#8208; and Amine&#8208; Promoted Multielectron Autoredox Transformation of Nitromethane: Multicomponent Access to Thiourea Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiourea derivatives are in&#8208;demand motifs in organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry and material science, yet redox methods for the synthesis that start from safe, simple, inexpensive and readily available feedstocks are scarce. In this article, we disclose the synthesis of these motifs using elemental sulfur and nitromethane as the starting materials. The method harnesses the multi&#8208;electron auto&#8208;redox property of nitromethane in the presence of sulfur and amines, delivering thiourea products without any added oxidant or reductant. Extension of this reaction to cyclizable amines and/or higher homologues of nitromethane led to a wide range of nitrogen heterocycles and thioamides. Operationally simple, the reactions are scalable, tolerate a wide range of functional groups, and can be employed for the direct functionalization of natural products. Mechanistically, the nitro group was found to act as an oxidant leaving group, being reduced to ammonia whereas sulfur, along with the role of a sulfur building block for the thiocarbonyl group, behaved as a complementary reductant, being oxidized to sulfate.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Chiral Aza/Boracyclophanes with a meta and para Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein describe the synthesis of a new class of axially chiral aza/boracyclophanes (BDN1, BXN1, BDB1 and BXB1) using binaphthyls as chiral building blocks and the main&#8208;group (B/N) chemistry with tunable electronic effects. All macrocycles substituted with triarylamine donors or triarylborane acceptors are strongly luminescent. These macrocycles showed two distinct meta and para &#960;&#8208;conjugation pathways, leading to the formation of quasi figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight and square&#8208;shaped conformations. Interestingly, comparison of such structural models revealed that the former type of macrocycles BXN1 and BXB1 gave higher racemization barriers relative to the other ones. The results reported here may provide a new approach to engineer the optical stability of &#960;&#8208;conjugated chiral macrocycles by controlling &#960;&#8208;substitution patterns. The ring constraints induced by macrocyclization were also demonstrated to contribute to the configurational persistence as compared with the open&#8208;chain analoguesp&#8208;BTT and m&#8208;BTT.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking radial dipole symmetry in planar macrocycles modulates edge&#8208;edge packing and disrupts cofacial stacking</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dipolar interactions are ever&#8208;present in supramolecular architectures though their impact is typically revealed by making dipoles stronger. While it is also possible to assess the role of dipoles by altering their orientations using synthetic design, doing so without altering molecular shape is not straightforward. We do this by flipping one triazole unit in a rigid macrocycle, tricarb. The macrocycle is composed of three carbazoles (2 Debye) and three triazoles (5 Debye) defining an array of dipoles aligned radially but organized alternately in and out. These dipoles are believed to dictate edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge tiling and face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking. We modified our synthesis to prepare isosteric macrocycles with the orientation of one triazole dipole rotated 40&#176;. The new dipole orientations guide edge&#8208;edge contacts to reorder the stability of two surface&#8208;bound 2D polymorphs. The impact on dipole&#8208;enhanced &#960; stacking, however, was unexpected. Our stacking model identified an unchanged set of short&#8208;range (3.4 &#197;) anti&#8208;parallel dipole contacts. Despite this situation, the reduction in self&#8208;association was attributed to long&#8208;range (~6.4 &#197;) dipolar repulsions between &#960;&#8208;stacked macrocycles. This work highlighted our ability to control the build&#8208;up and symmetry of macrocyclic skeletons by synthetic design, and the work needed to further our understanding of how dipoles control self&#8208;assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of novel redox&#8208;active organic materials based on benzimidazole, benzoxazole, and benzothiazole &#8211; a combined theoretical and experimental screening approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sustainability is one of the hot topics of todays&#8217; research, in particular when it comes to energy storage systems such as batteries. Redox&#8208;active molecules implemented in organic batteries represent a promising alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which partially rely on non&#8208;sustainable heavy metal salts. As an alternative, we propose benzothiazole, &#8208;oxazole and &#8208;imidazole derivatives as redox&#8208;active moieties for polymers in organic (radical) batteries. The target mole&#173;cules have been identified by a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches for the investigation of new organic active materials. Herein, we present the synthesis, electrochemical cha&#173;rac&#173;terization and theoretical investigation of the proposed molecules, which can later be introduced into a polymer backbone and utilized in organic polymer batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Studies of &#946;&#8208;Azapeptoid Foldamers: A New Class of Peptidomimetics with Confined Dihedrals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling amide bond geometries and the secondary structures of &#946;&#8208;peptoids is a challenging task as they contain several rotatable single bonds in their backbone. Herein, we describe the synthesis and conformational properties of novel &#8220;&#946;&#8208;azapeptoids&#8221; with confined dihedrals. We discuss how the acylhydrazide sidechains in these molecules enforce trans amide geometries (&#969; ~ 180&#8304;) via steric and stereoelectronic effects. We also show that the &#920;(C&#945;&#8208;C&#946;) and &#936;(OC&#8208;C&#945;) backbone torsions of &#946;&#8208;azapeptoids occupy a narrow range (170&#8208;180&#8304;) that can be rationalized by the staggered conformational preference of the backbone methylene carbons and a novel backbone nO &#8594; &#963;*C&#946;&#8208;N interaction discovered in this study. However, the &#966; (C&#946;&#8208;N) torsion remains freely rotatable and, depending on &#966;, the sidechains can be parallel, perpendicular, and anti&#8208;parallel relative to each other. In fact, we observed parallel and perpendicular relative orientations of sidechains in the crystal geometries of &#946;&#8208;azapeptoid dimers. We show that &#966; of &#946;&#8208;azapeptoids can be controlled by incorporating a bulky substituent at the backbone &#946;&#8208;carbon, which could provide complete control over all the backbone dihedrals. Finally, we show that the &#966; and &#936; dihedrals of &#946;&#8208;azapeptoids resemble that of a PPII helix and they retain&#160;PPII structure when incorporated in Host&#8208;Guest proline peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Potential of Heterogeneous Catalysts for Molecular Solar Thermal Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar energy utilization has gained considerable attention due to its abundance and renewability. However, its intermittent nature presents a challenge in harnessing its full potential. The development of energy storing compounds capable of capturing and releasing solar energy on demand has emerged as a potential solution. These compounds undergo a photochemical transformation that results in a high&#8208;energy metastable photoisomer, which stores solar energy in the form of chemical bonds and can release it as heat when required. Such systems are referred to as MOlecular Solar Thermal (MOST)&#8208;systems. Although the photoisomerization of MOST systems has been vastly studied, its back&#8208;conversion, particularly using heterogeneous catalysts, is still underexplored and the development of effective catalysts for releasing stored energy is crucial. Herein we compare the performance of 27 heterogeneous catalysts releasing the stored energy in an efficient Norbornadiene/Quadricyclane (NBD/QC) MOST system. We report the first benchmarking of heterogeneous catalysts for a MOST system using a robust comparison method of the catalysts&#8217; activity and monitoring the conversion using UV&#8208;Visible (UV&#8208;Vis) spectroscopy. Our findings provide insights into the development of effective catalysts for MOST systems.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Solar energy utilization has gained considerable attention due to its abundance and renewability. However, its intermittent nature presents a challenge in harnessing its full potential. The development of energy storing compounds capable of capturing and releasing solar energy on demand has emerged as a potential solution. These compounds undergo a photochemical transformation that results in a high-energy metastable photoisomer, which stores solar energy in the form of chemical bonds and can release it as heat when required. Such systems are referred to as MOlecular Solar Thermal (MOST)-systems. Although the photoisomerization of MOST systems has been vastly studied, its back-conversion, particularly using heterogeneous catalysts, is still underexplored and the development of effective catalysts for releasing stored energy is crucial. Herein we compare the performance of 27 heterogeneous catalysts releasing the stored energy in an efficient Norbornadiene/Quadricyclane (NBD/QC) MOST system. We report the first benchmarking of heterogeneous catalysts for a MOST system using a robust comparison method of the catalysts&#8217; activity and monitoring the conversion using UV-Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. Our findings provide insights into the development of effective catalysts for MOST systems. We anticipate that our assay will reveal the necessity of further investigation on heterogeneous catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of Diterpenoids from iso&#8208;GGPP III: A Geranylgeranyl Diphosphate Analog with Shifted Double Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The analog of the diterpene precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate with a double bond shifted from C14=C15 to C15=C16 (named iso&#8208;GGPP III) was synthesised and enzymatically coverted with six bacterial diterpene synthases, which allowed for the isolation of nine non&#8208;natural diterpenes. For some of the enzyme&#8208;substrate combinations the different reactivity implemented in the substrate analog iso&#8208;GGPP opened reaction pathways that are impossible with natural GGPP, resulting in the formation of diterpenes with novel skeletons. A stereoselective deuteration strategy was used to assign the absolute configurations of the isolated diterpenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Hauser&#8208;Kraus Annulation Initiated Multi&#8208;Cascade Reactions for Facile Access to Functionalized and Fused Oxazepines, Carbazoles and Phenanthridinediones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Hauser&#8208;Kraus (H&#8208;K) annulation of N&#8208;unsubstituted 3&#8208;olefinic oxindoles with 3&#8208;nucleophilic phthalides triggers a cascade of ring expansion and ring contraction reactions through several regioselective steps in one pot. While oxazepines were isolated in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of base at room temperature, carbazoles and phenanthridinediones were the products in the presence of excess base and microwave irradiation. Mechanistic studies guided by stepwise reactions and control experiments revealed that the isolable oxazepine intermediate, formed via ring expansion of the H&#8208;K adduct, is the key precursor to carbazole and phenanthridinedione via decarboxylative regioselective cyclizations.</dc:description>

The facile cleavage of the B&#8722;Se bond makes 2 a neutral source of selenium nucleophiles in substitutions reactions with benzyl bromides, and provide access to the corresponding selenoethers. The direct transformations of one of the C(sp2)&#8208;F bonds of C6F5N and C6F5CF3 to C&#8208;Se bonds have also been achieved by the use of 2 without employing transition&#8208;metal catalysts. While it was previously established that C6F6 could undergo complete defluoroselenation under harsh conditions, we successfully achieved partial fluorination of C6F6 by employing 2 as a mild selenide transfer reagent. During the formation of C&#8210;Se bonds through the cleavage of C&#8210;F bonds, the potential by&#8208;product NHC&#183;BH2F undergoes ring expansion of the NHC, leading to the formation of the six&#8208;membered diaazafluoroborinane (7).</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination Engineering of Heteronuclear Fe&#8208;Mo Dual&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Promoted Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation: A DFT Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient nanostructured electrocatalysts for N2 reduction to NH3 under mild conditions remains a major challenge. The Fe&#8208;Mo cofactor serves as the archetypal active site in nitrogenase. Inspired by nitrogenase, we designed a series of heteronuclear dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) labeled as FeMoN6&#8208;aXa (a =1, 2, 3; X = B, C, O, S) anchored on the pore of g&#8208;C3N4 to probe the impact of coordination on FeMo&#8208;catalyzed nitrogen fixation. The stability, reaction paths, activity, and selectivity of 12 different FeMoN6&#8208;aXaDACs have been systematically studied using density functional theory. Of these, four DACs (FeMoN5B1, FeMoN5O1, FeMoN4O2, and FeMoN3C3) displayed promising nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) performance. Notably, FeMoN5O1 stands out with an ultralow limiting potential of &#8722;0.11 V and high selectivity. Analysis of the density of states and charge/spin changes shows FeMoN5O1's high activity arises from optimal N2 binding on Fe initially and synergy of the FeMo dimer enabling protonation in NRR. This work contributes to the advancement of rational design for efficient NRR catalysts by regulating atomic coordination environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Are &#8216;carbon dots&#8217; always carbon dots? Evidence for their supramolecular nature from structural and dynamic studies in solution and in the pure solid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A model for the morphology (size, shape, and crystallinity) of carbon dots (CDs) in solid state consistent with the observed photoluminescence in solution is herein proposed. Overwhelming evidence has been collected which links the data coming from solid state analysis (high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS)) to that of solution (pulsed field gradient (PFG)&#8208;nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, time&#8208;resolved fluorescence anisotropy (TRFA), and steady&#8208;state/time&#8208;resolved fluorescence), allowing the establishment of an overall structural model for CDs. According to this model, the so&#8208;called carbon dots, observed under HRTEM imaging, are in fact supramolecular organized structures dynamically assembled from small to medium size molecular species when removing the solvent to obtain the solid form. In this way, the imaged nanoparticles (TEM/AFM) are not covalently bound entities formed during the synthetic process, but instead supramolecular entities formed by noncovalent interactions. These particles, if at all present in solution, have the form of loose associations of relatively small molecules. The present study was conducted on CDs obtained from the hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of a biomass waste (olive wet pomace).</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Waixenicin A: Exploring Strategies for Nine&#8208;Membered Ring Formation&#8203;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a comprehensive account on our efforts behind the recently published synthesis of waixenicin A. Our approach for constructing the dihydropyran ring relied on an Achmatowicz rearrangement. For the assembly of the nine&#8208;membered ring four distinct strategies were investigated. Our initial attempts using radical&#8208;based addition/fragmentation reactions targeting the C7&#8208;C11 bond proved unsuitable for accessing the 6/9&#8208;bicycle. By employing anionic fragmentation conditions at the furfuryl alcohol stage, we successfully reached a 5/9&#8208;bicycle. However, subsequent ring&#8208;expansion was unsuccessful. Alternative approaches, such as Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi or Heck reactions to connect the C6&#8208;C7 bond, also encountered difficulties, with no nine&#8208;membered ring formation observed. Our first breakthrough came from our attempts to install the C5&#8208;C6 bond via an intramolecular alkylation. Surprisingly, subsequent functional group modifications proved unexpectedly challenging, necessitating a redesign of our synthetic route. Drawing from all our investigations, we concluded that construction of the C9&#8208;C10 bond would enable efficient nine&#8208;membered ring alkylation and would facilitate the installation of the desired substitution pattern along the southern periphery. Exploration of this strategy yielded further surprises but ultimately led to the successful synthesis of waixenicin A and 9&#8208;deacetoxy&#8208;14,15&#8208;deepoxyxeniculin. For the latter compound, a bioinspired one&#8208;step rearrangement to xeniafauranol A was achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Calamitic Liquid Crystals for Reversible Light&#8208;modulated Phase Regulation based on Arylazopyrazole Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of responsive liquid crystals enables a diversity of technological applications. Especially photochromic liquid crystals gained a lot of interest in recent years due to the excellent spatiotemporal control of their phase transitions. In this work we present calamitic light responsive mesogens based on a library of arylazopyrazole photoswitches. These compounds show liquid&#8208;crystalline behavior as shown by differential scanning calorimetry, grazing incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction and polarized optical microscopy. UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and NMR analysis confirmed the excellent photophysical properties in solution and thin film. Additionally, polarized optical microscopy studies of the pristine compounds show reversible phase transition upon irradiation with light. Moreover, as a dopant in the commercially available liquid crystal 4&#8208;cyano&#8208;4'&#8208;pentylbiphenyl (5CB), the temperature range was reduced to ambient temperatures while preserving the excellent photophysical properties. Remarkably this co&#8208;assembled system shows reversible liquid&#8208;crystalline to isotropic phase transition upon irradiation with light of different wavelengths. The spatiotemporal control of the phase transition of the liquid crystals offers opportunities in the development of optical devices.</dc:description>
