         <title>Flow Electrochemistry for the N&#8208;Nitrosation of Secondary Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A flow electrochemical method towards the synthesis of&#160;N&#8208;nitroso compounds from secondary amines using cheap and readily available sodium nitrite was developed. Sodium nitrite dissolved in aqueous acetonitrile made additional electrolytes unnecessary. This mild and straightforward approach made the use of acids or other harsh and toxic chemicals redundant. This procedure was applied to an assortment of cyclic and acyclic secondary amines (27 examples) resulting in yields of&#160;N&#8208;nitrosamines as high as 99%. To demonstrate the practicality of the process, scale&#8208;up reactions were performed. Finally, selected products could be purified using an in&#8208;line acidic extraction.</dc:description>

         <title>Rationalizing the Extent of the &#8220;Sergeants&#8208;and&#8208;Soldiers&#8221; Effect in Supramolecular Helical Catalysts: Effect of Copper Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lower optical purities of supramolecular helical catalysts embedding a low fraction of &#8220;sergeants&#8221; is due to the aggregation of single helices through copper crosslinks.[MR1]&#160;







Abstract
Aggregation of supramolecular helices, for example through interdigitation of their alkyl side chains or through more directional supramolecular interactions, leads to hierarchical architectures with original structural and chiroptical properties. However, when a chiral monomer (the &#8220;sergeant&#8221;) is introduced as a minor component in these assemblies composed of a majority of achiral monomers (the &#8220;soldiers&#8221;), it is not clear how the aggregation changes the ability of the sergeant to induce a preferential helicity to the polymer main chain (the so&#8208;called &#8220;sergeants&#8208;and&#8208;soldiers&#8221; effect). This study reports a detailed investigation of the influence of [Cu(OAc)2&#8901;H2O] coordination on the structure and chiroptical properties of helical hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;assemblies composed of a catalytically&#8208;active benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) monomer, acting as the &#8220;soldier&#8221;, and an enantiopure BTA monomer derived from cyclohexylalanine, playing the role of the &#8220;sergeant&#8221;. The copper actually significantly influences the extent of the &#8220;sergeants&#8208;and&#8208;soldiers&#8221; effect since it acts as a crosslink that induces some chiral defects in the supramolecular helices. These crosslinks appear to be preserved during the catalytic hydrosilylation of 4&#8208;nitroacetophenone. The aggregation of helices through the formation of copper crosslinks is reversible since homochiral single helices are exclusively formed in the case of sergeant&#8208;rich assemblies. The fact that both main chain and side chain aggregation affects the chiroptical properties of supramolecular helices must be considered in the design of elaborated chiral materials.

         <title>Pentafluorophenol (C6F5OH) Catalyzed Pictet&#8208;Spengler Reaction: A Facile and Metal&#8208;Free Approach Towards Tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Carbolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have reported discovered pentafluorophenol to be an effective catalyst for the Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction, which synthesizes to synthesize (spirocyclic) tetrahydro &#946; carbolines. This simple catalytic methodology uses features mild conditions to generate high yields of indole alkaloids to produce indole alkaloids in high yield with remarkable functional group tolerance, including late&#8208;stage modifications. This strategy demonstrates a practical approach for synthesizing to the synthesis of the natural alkaloid Komavine on a gram&#8208;scale, as well as the synthesis of the commercial drug Tadalafil.







Abstract
Herein, we have disclosed pentafluorophenol as an operative catalyst for synthesizing (spirocyclic) tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines via the Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction. This straightforward catalytic protocol works under mild conditions resulting indole alkaloids in excellent yield with remarkable functional group tolerance, including late&#8208;stage modifications. This transformation demonstrates a practical and adaptable approach to produce a highly effective gram&#8208;scale synthesis of the natural alkaloid Komavine and enables the synthesis of the commercial drug Tadalafil.

Color&#8208;tunable luminescence materials: Homonuclear EuP and TbP as well as chemically and physically mixed Eu/Tb phosphonates exhibit color&#8208;tunable luminescence even near white&#8208;light emission, among which TbP is further used for Fe3+ detection.







Abstract
Molecular lanthanide phosphonates [Ln2(H3tpmm)2(H2O)6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xH2O (Ln=Eu, EuP; Ln=Tb, TbP) were synthesized. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction confirmed that EuP has a sandwich&#8208;like dinuclear structure, in which the Eu(III) center adopts a {EuO8} distorted dodecahedral geometry. XRPD patterns prove that TbP and EuP are isomorphous and isostructural. EuP and TbP are highly thermally stable approaching 450&#8201;&#176;C and exhibit red&#8208; and green&#8208;light emissions from the characteristic 4&#8201;f&#8211;4&#8201;f transition of the Eu3+ and Tb3+, respectively. Interestingly, luminescence modulation is achieved for the chemically mixed Eu/Tb phosphonate analogues, c&#8208;EuxTb2&#8211;xP (x=1.5, 1, 0.5), and physically mixed Eu/Tb phosphonate materials, p&#8208;yEuP&#8201;:&#8201;zTbP (y&#8201;:&#8201;z=3&#8201;:&#8201;1, 1&#8201;:&#8201;1, 1&#8201;:&#8201;3), with varying the excitation wavelength. Of particular note, near&#8208;white&#8208;light emission is also achieved for c&#8208;EuTbP, p&#8208;EuP&#8201;:&#8201;TbP, and p&#8208;EuP&#8201;:&#8201;3TbP when excited at 365&#8197;nm. Therefore, these dinuclear molecular lanthanide phosphonates emitting excitation wavelength and Eu3+&#8201;:&#8201;Tb3+ ratio dependent luminescence might be potential candidates for color&#8208;tunable luminescence materials and white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting materials. On the other hand, the bright green&#8208;light emission makes TbP to be an excellent reusable luminescence sensor for selective detection of Fe3+ with Stern&#8208;Volmer quenching constant (KSV) of 9.66&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1 and detection limit (DL) of 0.42&#8197;&#956;M through absorption competition caused luminescence quenching effect.

         <title>Pro&#8208;aromaticity Enabled Dealkenylative Functionalizations via Photo&#8208;Excitation and Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dealkenylative Giese&#8208;type addition, hydrazination, borylation, Minisci&#8208;type alkylation, copper&#8208;catalyzed NH alkylation, acylation, alkynylation, cyanation, and azidation, have been achieved on olefin&#8208;containing substrates in a one&#8208;pot and highly modular fashion.







Abstract
A general and practical approach for diverse dealkenylative functionalization of olefin&#8208;containing substrates has been developed through the one&#8208;pot formation and utilization of pro&#8208;aromatic 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridazines using tetrazine as the key cycloaddition reagent. Triggered by either excitation or oxidation, the targeted C&#8722;C bonds in the 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridazine intermediates could be readily cleaved to generate alkyl radicals for subsequent transformations. Diverse carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;hetero bond forming protocols, including Giese&#8208;type addition, hydrazination, borylation, Minisci&#8208;type alkylation, copper&#8208;catalyzed NH alkylation, acylation, alkynylation, cyanation, and azidation, are achieved in a highly modular fashion.

         <title>Highly Stereospecific On&#8208;Surface Dimerization into Bishelicenes: Topochemical Ullmann Coupling of Bromohelicene on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Only same handedness please! On&#8208;surface Ullmann C&#8722;C coupling of bromohelicene enantiomers leads stereospecifically only to homochiral combinations into bis(helicene).







Abstract
The on&#8208;surface dimerization into bis(hexahelicene) on a gold(111) surface has been studied by means of scanning tunneling microscopy and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary mass spectrometry. C&#8722;C Ullmann coupling of (rac)&#8208;2&#8208;bromo&#8208;hexahelicene leads to formation of the (M,M)&#8208; and (P,P)&#8208;diastereomers of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bis(hexahelicene), whilst formation of the (M,P)&#8208;diastereomer is not observed. Upon cooling, the bis(hexahelicene) aggregates into an ordered two&#8208;dimensional lattice with partly randomly distributed enantiomers. The highly specific diastereomeric coupling is explained by the surface alignment of educt in combination with the strong steric overcrowding in a possible surface&#8208;confined (M,P)&#8208;product.

         <title>Azide&#8211;Enolate Cycloaddition&#8208;Rearrangement Enables Direct &#945;&#8208;Amination of Amides and Enelactam Synthesis from Esters
</title>

         <dc:description>
Diverse frameworks via cycloaddition&#8208;rearrangement: Azide&#8208;enolate cycloaddition&#8208;rearrangements were applied to the direct &#945;&#8208;amination of amides and lactams, and synthesis of ene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams from esters. The outcome of the reaction varied by substrate, depending on the fate of triazoline intermediates generated in the cycloaddition. These processes form part of a wider cycloaddition&#8208;rearrangement reaction manifold providing concise access to diverse frameworks.







Abstract
Azide&#8208;enolate cycloaddition&#8208;rearrangements offer potential for rapid access to diverse molecular frameworks from simple precursors. We report here that investigations into the cycloadditions of ester or amide enolates with vinyl azides led to the identification of two reaction processes &#8211; direct &#945;&#8208;amination of amides and lactams, and the synthesis of ene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams from esters. The outcomes of these reactions depended on the fate of key vinyl triazoline intermediates generated in the initial cycloaddition step. Isolation of reaction intermediates in the ene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactam synthesis revealed the unexpected addition of two enolate equivalents, one of which is later eliminated. Computational studies further suggested an unusual reaction pathway involving direct addition of an enolate to the terminal carbon of the N&#8208;vinyl triazoline. In contrast, the &#945;&#8208;amination of amides and lactams proceeded by rearrangement of the intermediate triazoline to give an imine, hydrolysis or reduction of which gave access to primary or secondary &#945;&#8208;amino amides or lactams.

         <title>Self&#8208;Supported Ru&#8208;Incorporated NiSe2 for Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;supported Ru&#8208;incorporated NiSe2 (Ru&#8208;NiSe2) catalyst shows high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity with a small overpotential of 180.8&#8197;mV to achieve 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and excellent long&#8208;term stability for large&#8208;current&#8208;density HER in alkaline medium. A great number of accessible catalytically active sites, and well&#8208;modified electronic structure of Ru&#8208;NiSe2 contribute to its high HER activity.







Abstract
To meet the requirements for industrial water splitting to generate hydrogen, it is urgent, but still quite challenging to develop highly active and stable electrocatalysts for large&#8208;current&#8208;density hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, Ru&#8208;incorporated NiSe2 (Ru&#8208;NiSe2) was designed and synthesized. The introduction of Ru results in the formation of hierarchically structured Ru&#8208;NiSe2 with large electrochemical active surface area, and well&#8208;modified electronic structure. As expected, the as&#8208;fabricated Ru&#8208;NiSe2 displays impressive HER activity in 1.0&#8197;M&#8201;KOH, with a low overpotential of 180.8&#8197;mV to reach the current density of 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Ru&#8208;NiSe2 also presents outstanding long&#8208;term stability at high current densities, owing to its high intrinsic chemical stability, and strong catalyst&#8208;support interface. Notably, when performed at a certain current density of 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the overpotential increase after 90&#8197;h is only 13&#8197;mV. Such excellent HER performance of Ru&#8208;NiSe2 demonstrates its great potential for practical use in industrial water splitting.

By using benzylamines as the C4 source of 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines (1,4&#8208;DHPs), a Cu&#8208;catalyzed oxidative [1+2+1+2] cascade cyclization of N,N&#8208;dimethyl enaminones and benzylamines for the synthesis of 1,4&#8208;DHPs was firstly developed.







Abstract
Using benzylamines as the C4 source of 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines (1,4&#8208;DHPs), a Cu&#8208;catalyzed oxidative [1+2+1+2] cascade cyclization for the synthesis of 1,4&#8208;DHPs was firstly developed. A broad range of easily available N,N&#8208;dimethyl enaminones and benzylamines are employed smoothly to provide a diverse range of 1,4&#8208;DHPs with high efficiency. This method is performed by a one&#8208;pot cascade C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization/C(sp3)&#8722;N cleavage/cyclization strategy to form simultaneously two C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bonds, two C(sp2)&#8722;N bonds, and a 1,4&#8208;DHP ring.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using benzylamines as the C4 source of 1,4-dihydropyridines (1,4-DHPs), a Cu-catalyzed oxidative [1+2+1+2] cascade cyclization for the synthesis of 1,4-DHPs was firstly developed. A broad range of easily available &lt;i&gt;N,N&lt;/i&gt;-dimethyl enaminones and benzylamines are employed smoothly to provide a diverse range of 1,4-DHPs with high efficiency. This method is performed by a one-pot cascade C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bond functionalization/C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;N cleavage/cyclization strategy to form simultaneously two C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) bonds, two C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;N bonds, and a 1,4-DHP ring.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlling Morphologies of Redox&#8208;responsive Polymeric Nanocarriers for a Smart Drug Delivery System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox&#8208;responsive nanocarriers using disulfides or thiols have received considerable attention owing to the higher levels of glutathione (GSH) in cancer cells than those in extracellular fluids. Nevertheless, the normal&#8208;to&#8208;cancer&#8208;cell selectivity of these nanocarriers has not yet been clarified. Nanocarriers exhibit different cytotoxicities depending on the morphologies they adopt under the redox&#8208;active conditions typically existing in cancerous cells. Therefore, not only GSH levels but also reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and other complex cancerous cell conditions must be considered for the development of smart drug delivery systems. In this article, we describe the structural design of redox&#8208;responsive polymers that exhibit different morphological changes in environments akin to cancerous cells (e.g., GSH&#8208; and ROS&#8208;abundant conditions). In addition, we propose a molecular design for the spatiotemporal control of nanocarrier morphology depending on the levels of both GSH and ROS upon photoirradiation to increase the cytotoxicity difference between normal and cancer cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoluminescence Properties of Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes Influenced by the Tether Length of Reagents with Two Reactive Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functionalization of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) is an effective method for controlling a local band gap, resulting in photoluminescence (PL) in the near&#8208;infrared region. Herein, SWNTs were functionalized using a series of bromoalkanes and dibromoalkanes to evaluate the effects of their length on the nanotube PL properties. When bromoalkanes (CnH2n+1Br) or dibromoalkanes (CnH2nBr2) with tether lengths of six or more were utilized for six different semiconducting SWNTs, the obtained SWNT adducts exhibited two new PL peaks, whereas dibromoalkanes with tether lengths of 3&#8211;5 (CnH2nBr2: n = 3&#8211;5) produced single peaks. Combined with theoretical calculations, the results suggested that the tether length of reagents changes the formation mechanism of functionalized adducts, that is, CnH2nBr2&#160;(n = 3&#8211;5) tends to result in kinetic products.</dc:description>

         <title>Chalcogen Atom Size Dictates Stability of Benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;Triamide Polymers: Overlooked Role of Geometrical Fit for Enhanced Hydrogen Bonding</title>

         <dc:description>Our quantum chemical analyses elucidate how the replacement of O in the amide bonds of benzene&#8208;1,3&#8208;5&#8208;tricarboxamides (OBTAs) for the larger chalcogens S and Se enhances the intermolecular interactions and thereby the stability of the obtained hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular polymers by two unexpected mechanisms: i) the SBTA and SeBTA monomers have a better geometry for self&#8208;assembly and ii) induce stronger covalent (hydrogen&#8208;bond) interactions besides enhanced dispersion interactions. In addition, we show that the cooperativity in BTA self&#8208;assembly is caused by charge separation&#160;in the &#963;&#8208;electronic system following the covalency in the hydrogen bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Neutral, Heteroleptic [Cu(I)(PPh3)2(4H&#8208;imidazolato)] Complexes: Ligand Exchange Reactivity, Redox Properties, Excited&#8208;State Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hop on hop off: Typically, heteroleptic Cu(I)DiiminePPh3 complexes tend to form the homoleptic counterpart. But this is not observed when the diimine is an anionic 4H&#8208;imidazolate. Despite dynamic PPh3 ligand exchange in solution the deeply colored, photoredox&#8208;active Cu(I)4H&#8208;imidazolatoPPh3 complexes are stable.







Abstract
Cu(I) 4H&#8208;imidazolate complexes are rare examples of Cu(I) complexes with chelating anionic ligands and are potent photosensitizers with unique absorption and photoredox properties. In this contribution, five novel heteroleptic Cu(I) complexes with monodentate triphenylphosphine co&#8208;ligands are investigated. As a consequence of the anionic 4H&#8208;imidazolate ligand and in contrast to comparable complexes with neutral ligands, these complexes are more stable than their homoleptic bis(4H&#8208;imidazolato)Cu(I) congeners. Here, the ligand exchange reactivity was studied by 31P&#8208;,19F&#8208;, and variable temperature NMR and the ground state structural and electronic properties by X&#8208;ray diffraction, absorption spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. The excited&#8208;state dynamics were investigated by femto&#8208; and nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The observed differences, with respect to chelating bisphosphine bearing congeners, are often due to the increased geometric flexibility of the triphenylphosphines. These observations render the investigated complexes interesting candidates for photo(redox)reactions not accessible with chelating bisphosphine ligands.

         <title>Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Synthesis of Long&#8208;Chain Oligosaccharides for Studying Xylan&#8208;Modifying Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Xylan biosynthesis: Starting from dixylosides, chemo&#8208;enzymatic syntheses of xylan dodecasaccharides using glycosynthase&#8208;mediated coupling reactions between glycosyl fluoride donors and thioglycoside acceptors were performed. These long&#8208;chain xylan oligosaccharides were incubated with xylan&#8208;modifying enzymes from plants, i.&#8201;e., three glycosyltransferases and one acetyltransferase, and the reaction products were analyzed by MALDI&#8208;MS.







Abstract
Plant research is hampered in several aspects by a lack of pure oligosaccharide samples that closely represent structural features of cell wall glycans. An alternative to purely chemical synthesis to access these oligosaccharides is chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis using glycosynthases. These enzymes enable the ligation of oligosaccharide donors, when activated for example as &#945;&#8208;glycosyl fluorides, with suitable acceptor oligosaccharides. Herein, the synthesis of xylan oligosaccharides up to dodecasaccharides is reported, with glycosynthase&#8208;mediated coupling reactions as key steps. The xylo&#8208;oligosaccharide donors were protected at the non&#8208;reducing end with a 4&#8208;O&#8208;tetrahydropyranyl (THP) group to prevent polymerization. Installation of an unnatural 3&#8208;O&#8208;methylether substituent at the reducing end xylose of the oligosaccharides ensured good water solubility. Biochemical assays demonstrated enzymatic activity for the xylan acetyltransferase XOAT1 from Arabidopsis thaliana, xylan arabinofuranosyl&#8208;transferase XAT3 enzymes from rice and switchgrass, and the xylan glucuronosyltransferase GUX3 from Arabidopsis thaliana. In case of the glucuronosyltransferase GUX3, MALDI&#8208;MS/MS analysis of the reaction product suggested that a single glucuronosyl substituent was installed primarily at the central xylose residues of the dodecasaccharide acceptor, demonstrating the value of long&#8208;chain acceptors for assaying biosynthetic glycosyltransferases.

     alt="Chemo-Enzymatic Synthesis of Long-Chain Oligosaccharides for Studying Xylan-Modifying Enzymes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Xylan biosynthesis&lt;/b&gt;: Starting from dixylosides, chemo-enzymatic syntheses of xylan dodecasaccharides using glycosynthase-mediated coupling reactions between glycosyl fluoride donors and thioglycoside acceptors were performed. These long-chain xylan oligosaccharides were incubated with xylan-modifying enzymes from plants, i.&#8201;e., three glycosyltransferases and one acetyltransferase, and the reaction products were analyzed by MALDI-MS.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plant research is hampered in several aspects by a lack of pure oligosaccharide samples that closely represent structural features of cell wall glycans. An alternative to purely chemical synthesis to access these oligosaccharides is chemo-enzymatic synthesis using glycosynthases. These enzymes enable the ligation of oligosaccharide donors, when activated for example as &#945;-glycosyl fluorides, with suitable acceptor oligosaccharides. Herein, the synthesis of xylan oligosaccharides up to dodecasaccharides is reported, with glycosynthase-mediated coupling reactions as key steps. The xylo-oligosaccharide donors were protected at the non-reducing end with a 4-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-tetrahydropyranyl (THP) group to prevent polymerization. Installation of an unnatural 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methylether substituent at the reducing end xylose of the oligosaccharides ensured good water solubility. Biochemical assays demonstrated enzymatic activity for the xylan acetyltransferase XOAT1 from &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;, xylan arabinofuranosyl-transferase XAT3 enzymes from rice and switchgrass, and the xylan glucuronosyltransferase GUX3 from &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;. In case of the glucuronosyltransferase GUX3, MALDI-MS/MS analysis of the reaction product suggested that a single glucuronosyl substituent was installed primarily at the central xylose residues of the dodecasaccharide acceptor, demonstrating the value of long-chain acceptors for assaying biosynthetic glycosyltransferases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>ACTIVE&#8208;BAPO &#8211; A Versatile Transfer Agent for Photoactive Bis(acyl)phosphane Oxide Units</title>

         <dc:description>
Active BAPO &#8208; An NHS ester substituted bis(acyl)phosphane oxide (BAPO) is synthesized by phospha&#8208;Michael addition and used as the first versatile transfer agent for the grafting of photoactive BAPO units. Amino acids, porcine skin, and poly(amido)amine (PAMAM) dendrimers were functionalized with the photoactive units and used for the synthesis of thermosets with a different degree of crosslinking.







Abstract
A N&#8208;hydroxy succinimide (NHS) ester substituted bis(acyl)phosphane oxide (ACTIVE&#8208;BAPO) was prepared by phospha&#8208;Michael addition and used for an easy one&#8208;step BAPO ligation with substrates containing primary amino groups, such as amino acids, proteins, and poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers. Thereby, a range of new molecular and polymeric photoinitators was obtained. Real&#8208;time photo&#8208;rheology experiments demonstrated the outstanding efficiency of the PAMAM BAPOs as photoinitiators for free radical polymerization. Remarkably, it is found that PAMAM BAPOs also act as crosslinking agents to convert monofunctional methacrylate monomers into thermosetting networks without any further additives. Depending on the number of the attached BAPOs, thermosets with a different degree of crosslinking and swelling capability in water were obtained.

         <title>Combinatorial Coordination Self&#8208;Assembly for Organopalladium Cages with Fine&#8208;Tuned Structure and Function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combinatorial coordination self&#8208;assembly is a powerful tool to create the lower&#8208;symmetric coordination cages with increasing structural complexities and advanced functions. In this concept article, we define and summarized the strategy for the combinatorial self&#8208;assembled PdII coordination cages. Emergent functions on some selected PdII coordination cages were also introduced with an aim of emphasizing the advantages of the heteroleptic cages.







Abstract
Discrete organopalladium coordination cages have shown great potential in applications ranging from molecular recognition and sensing, drug delivery to enzymatic catalysis. While many of the known organopalladium cages are homoleptic structures with regular polyhedral shapes and symmetric inner cavities, heteroleptic cages with complex architectures and new functions coming from their anisotropic cavities have received an increasing attention recently. In this concept article, we discuss a powerful combinatorial coordination self&#8208;assembly strategy toward the construction of a family of organopalladium cages, including both homoleptic and heteroleptic ones, from a given library of ligands. Within such a cage family, the heteroleptic cages often feature systematically fine&#8208;tuned structures and emergent properties, distinct from their parent homoleptic counterparts. We hope the concepts and examples provided in this article can offer some rational guidance for the design of new coordination cages toward advanced functions.

         <title>Molecular Hinges by Fusion of Pyrrole and Dithiin: Synthesis, Structure, Redox Chemistry and Host&#8211;Guest Complexation of Dipyrrolo&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiins</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of novel hinge&#8208;like molecules, namely dipyrrolo&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiins, were prepared via fusion of pyrroles with 1,4&#8208;dithiin. Their hinged structure, excellent redox&#8208;activity, and adaptive host&#8211;guest chemistry have provided great potentials for developing redox&#8208;switchable host&#8211;guest systems and materials.







Abstract
A series of novel hinge&#8208;like molecules, namely dipyrrolo&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiins (PDs), were prepared and fully characterized by NMR, UV/vis, cyclic voltammogram, ESR, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis. The lateral fusion of pyrroles with 1,4&#8208;dithiins has led to not only retained key features of a dithiin, but also enhanced redox&#8208;activity with increased susceptibility to radical cations via redox or chemical oxidation. Stabilization of their radicals are observed for the N,N&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl or N,N&#8208;triphenylmethyl PD as evidenced by ESR measurements. DFT calculations and SCXRD analysis revealed PDs are extremely flexible with adaptive molecular geometries that can be mechanically regulated via crystal packing or host&#8211;guest complexation. The excellent donor nature of PDs renders inclusion complexes with the cyclophane bluebox (cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene)), featuring association constants up to 104&#8197;M&#8722;1. Additionally, a planarized transition intermediate associated with inversion dynamics of a PD has been preserved in the pseudorotaxane structure with assistances of &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. The hinged structure, excellent redox&#8208;activity, and adaptive nature of PDs could further enable accesses to exotic redox switchable host&#8211;guest chemistry and functional materials.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Stabilized CsPbI3 Nanocrystals with Tailored Organic Polymer Ligand Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable black&#8208;phase &#947;&#8208;CsPbI3 nanocrystals capped with a new organic polymer ligand, HO&#8208;PS&#8208;N3, have been synthesized by hot&#8208;injection method with significantly improved resistance to moisture and light.







Abstract
Perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) exhibit attractive photophysical properties by combining the excellent optoelectronic properties of bulk perovskites with the strong quantum confinement effect at the nanoscale. However, CsPbI3 NCs easily transform into a non&#8208;perovskite phase because of the ionic lattice and dynamic ligand binding. Herein, stable black&#8208;phase CsPbI3 NCs capped with a new organic ligand, HO&#8208;PS&#8208;N3 (HOPS), which consists of a polystyrene segment with hydroxyl and azide end groups, are reported. This organic polymer ligand passivated the surface defects and enhanced the stability of CsPbI3 NCs by exposing the linking hydrophobic polystyrene segment. Consequently, the optimized CsPbI3 NCs exhibit significantly improved resistance to moisture or light and maintained 70&#8201;% of the original luminous intensity after immersion in water for two months. The theoretical results revealed that the binding energy of the HOPS ligand on the surface of the CsPbI3 NCs is higher than that of the commonly used oleic acid, alleviating the defects&#8208;induced degradation during purification. Thus, surface&#8208;stabilized CsPbI3 NCs are beneficial for a broad range of optoelectronic applications.

This Concept article summarizes the progress of azametallacyclopentadienes towards their generated methods, structural characterization, intrinsic reactivity, and application in the heterocyclic synthesis since the new century.







Abstract
As the key intermediates in metal&#8208;promoted/catalyzed C&#8722;C bond coupling reactions of nitriles and alkynes, azametallacyclopentadienes, M(N=CR1&#8722;CR2=CR3), are an important class of azametallacycles. Although the first authentic azametallacyclopentadienes were documented in 1986, their chemistry towards solid&#8208;state structures, intrinsic reactivity, and synthetic application was rarely investigated for a long time. At the beginning of this century, seminal works about the applications of azametallacyclopentadienes in the synthesis of heterocycles, including multi&#8208;substituted pyridines, isoquinolines, furans, and pyrroles were reported. Subsequently, a series of new complexes with this motif, namely the Group 4, aluminum, actinide, and rare&#8208;earth azametallacyclopentadienes were isolated and structurally characterized. Among them, the rare&#8208;earth azametallacyclopentadiene expresses high reactivity towards unsaturated molecules, such as nitriles, isocyanides, and Mo(CO)6 to provide novel fused metallacycles. In this Concept, we reviewed the advances in the preparation, reactivity, and synthetic application of azametallacyclopentadienes in the past twenty years.

         <title>Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Gene Silencing Facilitated by Mito&#8208;CPDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Gene Silencing: We report a mitochondria&#8208;targeted cell&#8208;penetrating poly(disulfide)s (Mito&#8208;CPDs), which is not only compatible with commercially available gene&#8208;silencing reagents without the need of chemical or genetic modifications, but also capable of transporting siRNA and ASO into mitochondria and thereby silencing mtDNA specifically.







Abstract
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) plays an essential role in maintaining normal cellular activities. Its heteroplasmic mutations are known to cause various genetic diseases. Current genetic engineering strategies, such as those based on RNA interference (RNAi) and antisense technology, are difficult to genetically alter mtDNA, however, due to the inability of highly negatively charged oligonucleotides to translocate across the double&#8208;membrane mitochondria. We report herein a universal mitochondria&#8208;targeted gene&#8208;delivery approach by using cell&#8208;penetrating poly(disulfide)s (CPDs). Novel CPD&#8208;based mitochondrial transporters, named Mito&#8208;CPDs, were synthesized by using triphenylphosphonium (TPP)&#8208;fused propagating monomers containing either disulfide or diselenide backbones. Upon spontaneous complex formation with an oligonucleotide (single&#8208; or double&#8208;stranded), the resulting nanoscale Mito&#8208;CPD@Oligo exhibited excellent properties in common biological media. While the intracellular gene&#8208;delivery efficiency of these Mito&#8208;CPDs was comparable to that of commercial transfection agents, their unique mitochondria&#8208;localized properties enabled effective release of the loaded cargo inside these organelles. Subsequent mitochondrial delivery of siRNA and antisense oligonucleotides against suitable mtDNA&#8208;encoded proteins showed successful down&#8208;regulation of target protein expression, leading to profound effects on mitochondrial functions. Mito&#8208;CPDs thus provide a useful tool for future investigations of mitochondrial biology and treatment of mitochondria&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Construction of a Diverse Range of Boron Heterocycles via Ring Expansion of a Carboranyl&#8208;Substituted 9&#8208;Borafluorene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring expansion of a carboranyl&#8208;substituted 9&#8208;borafluorene with unsaturated substrates provides easy access to a range of boraheterocyclic products containing six&#8208;, seven&#8208;, and eight&#8208;membered rings. Compared to known aryl&#8208; and halogen&#8208;substituted borafluorene derivatives, the study shows that the electron&#8208;withdrawing carboranyl substituent leads to more facile and more selective insertion reactions.







Abstract
Direct insertion of unsaturated substrates into a five&#8208;membered borole ring is a useful method to obtain valuable heterocycles containing one or more three&#8208;coordinate boron atoms. A highly Lewis acidic 9&#8208;o&#8208;carboranyl&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene, in which the o&#8208;carboranyl substituent is connected via one of the cluster carbon atoms to the boron atom of the 9&#8208;borafluorene unit, was found to react with a vast array of unsaturated molecules, such as alkynes, aldehydes and various organic azides, to form larger boraheterocyclic products. The ring expansion reactions of the central borole ring proceed rapidly at room temperature, cementing the role of the o&#8208;carboranyl substituent in enhancing the insertion reactivity of 9&#8208;borafluorenes.

         <title>Detection of Large Genomic RNA via DNAzyme&#8208;Mediated RNA Cleavage and Rolling Circle Amplification: SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8201;as a Model</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double screening: A new method is reported for rapid, amplified detection of large genomic RNA using SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 as a model. The double screening method first parses a large set of DNAzymes to those that mediate efficient RNA cleavage and then screens the best DNAzymes for effective coupling to rolling circle amplification.







Abstract
A new method for the detection of genomic RNA combines RNA cleavage by the 10&#8208;23 DNAzyme and use of the cleavage fragments as primers to initiate rolling circle amplification (RCA). 230 different 10&#8208;23 DNAzyme variants were screened to identify those that target accessible RNA sites within the highly structured RNA transcripts of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. A total of 28 DNAzymes were identified with &gt;20&#8201;% cleavage, 5 with &gt;40&#8201;% cleavage and one with &gt;60&#8201;% in 10&#8197;min. The cleavage fragments from these reactions were then screened for coupling to an RCA reaction, leading to the identification of several cleavage fragments that could efficiently initiate RCA. Using a newly developed quasi&#8208;exponential RCA method with a detection limit of 500 aM of RNA, 14 RT&#8208;PCR positive and 15 RT&#8208;PCR negative patient saliva samples were evaluated for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genomic RNA, achieving a clinical sensitivity of 86&#8201;% and specificity of 100&#8201;% for detection of the virus in &lt;2.5&#8197;h.

         <title>Wide&#8208;Temperature Flexible Supercapacitor from an Organohydrogel Electrolyte and Its Combined Electrode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multipurpose gels: A flexible supercapacitor that integrates a wide application temperature range (&#8722;20&#8211;80&#8201;&#176;C), satisfactory electrochemical performance and mechanical properties has been fabricated by using ionic conductive, anti&#8208;freezing and anti&#8208;drying organohydrogels both as electrolyte and binder of the combined electrode.







Abstract
Hydrogel&#8208;based flexible supercapacitors possess the merits of highly ionic conductivity and superior power density, but the existence of water limits their application in extreme temperature scenarios. Noticeably, it is a challenge for people to design more extremely temperature adaptable systems for flexible supercapacitors based on hydrogels with a wide temperature region. In this work, a wide&#8208;temperature flexible supercapacitor that can operate at &#8722;20&#8211;80&#8201;&#176;C was fabricated by an organohydrogel electrolyte and its combined electrode (also known as an electrode/electrolyte composite). Upon introducing highly hydratable LiCl into an ethylene glycol (EG)/H2O binary solvent, owing to the ionic hydration effect of LiCl and the hydrogen bond interaction between EG and H2O molecules, the organohydrogel electrolyte exhibits satisfactory resistance to freezing (freezing point of &#8722;113.9&#8201;&#176;C), anti&#8208;drying capability (78.2&#8201;% of weight retention after vacuum drying at 60&#8201;&#176;C for 12&#8197;h) and excellent ionic conductivity both at room temperature (13.9&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and low temperature (6.5&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 after 31&#8197;days at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C). By using organohydrogel electrolyte as binder, the prepared electrode/electrolyte composite effectively reduces interface impedance and enhances specific capacitance due to the uninterrupted ion transport channels and extended interface contact area. The assembled supercapacitor delivers a specific capacitance of 149&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1, a power density of 160&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1, and an energy density of 13.24&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The initial 100&#8201;% capacitance can be maintained after 2000 cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. More importantly, the specific capacitances can be well maintained even at &#8722;20 and 80&#8201;&#176;C. With other advantages such as excellent mechanical property, the supercapacitor is an ideal power source suitable for various working conditions.

Upon introducing highly hydratable LiCl into an ethylene glycol (EG)/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O binary solvent, owing to the ionic hydration effect of LiCl and the hydrogen bond interaction between EG and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules, the organohydrogel electrolyte exhibits satisfactory resistance to freezing (freezing point of &#8722;113.9&#8201;&#176;C), anti-drying capability (78.2&#8201;% of weight retention after vacuum drying at 60&#8201;&#176;C for 12&#8197;h) and excellent ionic conductivity both at room temperature (13.9&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and low temperature (6.5&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 31&#8197;days at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C). By using organohydrogel electrolyte as binder, the prepared electrode/electrolyte composite effectively reduces interface impedance and enhances specific capacitance due to the uninterrupted ion transport channels and extended interface contact area. The assembled supercapacitor delivers a specific capacitance of 149&#8197;F&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, a power density of 160&#8197;W&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and an energy density of 13.24&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The initial 100&#8201;% capacitance can be maintained after 2000 cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. More importantly, the specific capacitances can be well maintained even at &#8722;20 and 80&#8201;&#176;C. With other advantages such as excellent mechanical property, the supercapacitor is an ideal power source suitable for various working conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structurally Ordered PtNi Intermetallic Nanoparticles as Efficient and Stable Cathode Catalysts for Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ordered intermetallic PtNi nanoparticles loaded on graphited carbon were synthesized using a facile method. The ORR performance can be significantly improved via turning the element distribution of PtNi intermetallic compounds catalysts into ordered structure by high temperature annealing. Benefiting from a highly graphitized carbon support with excellent corrosion resistance, the obtained ordered catalysts with Pt loading of 27.6&#8201;% exhibit higher activity and better durability toward ORR than commercial Pt/C, which have been verified in both RDE test and single cell test.







Abstract
Exploring oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts with superior electrochemical performance and long&#8208;term stability is crucial to the development of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). In this work, graphited carbon with high specific surface area was obtained under relatively low temperature using Ni catalyst, then ordered nanoparticles (NPs) PtNi catalysts attaching to graphited carbon were synthesized via polyol reduction and thermal treatment. Benefiting from graphitized carbon support and appropriate order degree, PtNi/GC&#8208;700 NPs catalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic ORR performance with specific and mass activities as high as 2.8&#8208;fold and 3.7&#8208;fold of the commercial Pt/C catalyst, respectively. Besides, the as&#8208;prepared PtNi/GC&#8208;700 catalyst exhibits superior stability with negligible degradation after 10000 potential cycles, due to its ordered chemical structure. The work described herein highlights the potential of structurally ordered electrocatalysts for efficient and durable fuel cell cathodic catalysts.

         <title>Precise Control of Dissipative Self&#8208;assembly by Light and Electricity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using light and electricity as two clean and spatiotemporally addressable fuels, we can precisely control dissipative self&#8208;assembly into various morphologies including asymmetric forms without altering the solution composition. Such precise control over supramolecular assemblies may find future applications in programming complex active materials as well as formulating pharmaceutical reagents with desired morphologies.







Abstract
Nature&#8208;inspired synthetic dissipative self&#8208;assemblies have attracted much attention recently. However, it remains a major challenge to achieve precise control over dissipative supramolecular assembly structures and functions of self&#8208;contained systems. Here we combine light and electricity as two clean, and spatiotemporally addressable fuels to provide precise control over the morphology for dissipative self&#8208;assembly of a perylene bisimide glycine (PBIg) building block in a self&#8208;contained solution. In this design, electrochemical oxidation provides the positive fuel to activate PBIg self&#8208;assembly while photoreduction supplies the negative fuel to deactivate the system for disassembly. Through programming the two counteracting fuels, we demonstrated the control of PBIg self&#8208;assembly into a variety of assembly morphologies in a self&#8208;contained system. In addition, by exerting light and electrical dual fuels simultaneously, we could create an active homeostasis exhibiting dynamic instability, leading to morphological change to asymmetric assemblies with curvatures. Such precise control over self&#8208;assembly of self&#8208;contained systems may find future applications in programming complex active materials as well as formulating pharmaceutical reagents with desired morphologies.

         <title>Double Addition vs. Ring Closure: Systematic Reactivity Study of CO(NCO)2 and CO(NCS)2 towards Hydrogen Halides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions between carbonyl diisocyanate or isothiocyanate and hydrogen halide gases as stereotypical nucleophiles show two different reaction pathways. The diisocyanate adds nucleophiles to form carbamoyl halides, whereas the isothiocyanate undergoes ring closure forming thiadiazines. These reactions indicate the significant influence of the chalcogen atom on the reaction products as well as their stability and characteristics. More information can be found in the Research Article by F. Tambornino and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203983). Artwork by Janina Ill.

Isomerization reversibility of visible&#8208;light responsive donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adducts in nanopores of metal&#8211;organic frameworks is strongly dependent on the polarity of their pore environment. In low polar MIL&#8208;53(Al), proton conductivity as high as 0.013 S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and at least 30 switching cycles are achieved under visible light at 80&#8201;&#176;C and 98&#8201;% RH.







Abstract
In recent years, light&#8208;responsive molecules have been incorporated in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) to fabricate light&#8208;responsive intelligent devices, where reversible isomerization of the guest molecules in the nanopores is crucial. However, how to design a porous environment of MOFs to achieve a reversible isomerization remains unknown until now. In this work, donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs), a new kind of visible light responsive compound, were confined in the nanopores of different MOFs to study their isomerization upon visible&#8208;light irradiation/mild heating. We found that the polarity of the pore environment is the key to control the reversibility of isomerization of such guest molecules. Under the guidance of this principle, MIL&#8208;53(Al) was screened to investigate the proton conductivity and switching performance of the DASA&#8208;confined MOF. The proton conductance was up to 0.013 S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C and 98&#8201;% RH, and at least 30 switching cycles were achieved thanks to the Grotthuss&#8208;type mechanism and the low polarity of MIL&#8208;53(Al) pore environment.

         <title>Highly E&#8208;Selective Olefin Synthesis Catalysed by Novel Quinoxalinone Photocatalyst under Visible Light Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for the synthesis of highly E&#8208;selective olefins directly utilizing alkyl boronic acids as radical precursors was developed, catalysed by novel quinoxalinone&#8208;type catalyst.







Abstract
In photo&#8208;induced olefin synthesis, the photocatalysts with high triplet energy could cause the isomerization of olefins. This study demonstrates a new quinoxalinone photocatalytic system for highly stereoselective alkenes preparation from alkenyl sulfones and alkyl boronic acids. Our photocatalyst could not convert the thermodynamically favored E&#8208;olefin to Z&#8208;olefin, guaranteeing the high E&#8208;configuration selectivity of the reaction. There is weak interaction between boronic acids and quinoxalinone according to NMR experiments, probably decreasing the oxidation potential of boronic acids. This system can be further extended to the allyl and alkynyl sulfones to give corresponding alkenes and alkynes.

         <dc:description>
Shedding light on the structure and solvation state of lithium compounds in aligned solution: The residual quadrupolar coupling of 7Li in a range of lithium complexes due to the interaction of the electric field gradient (shown in its graphical tensor form) with the alignment in a stretched polymer gel has been investigated using NMR spectroscopy. The preferred orientation of the molecules in the anisotropic environment is illustrated in the background. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. John and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203995).

         <title>Breaking the DFT Energy Bias Caused by Intramolecular Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Interactions with MESSI, a Structural Elucidation Method Inspired by Wisdom of the Crowd Theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of quantum&#8208;based NMR methods to complement and guide the connectivity and stereochemical assignment of natural and unnatural products has grown enormously. One of the unsolved problems is related to the improper calculation of the conformational landscape of flexible molecules that have functional groups capable of generating a complex network of intramolecular H&#8208;bonding (IHB) interactions. Here we present MESSI (Multi&#8208;Ensemble Strategy for Structural Identification), a method inspired by the wisdom of the crowd theory that breaks with the traditional mono&#8208;ensemble approach. By including independent mappings of selected artificially manipulated ensembles, MESSI greatly improves the sense of the assignment by neutralizing potential energy biases.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Photocatalytic Deracemization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric catalysis has long been recognized as a powerful tool for the synthesis of enantioenriched molecules. In addition to precise enantiocontrol, high&#8208;atom economy has always been pursued by chemists in the development of methodologies, which is crucial for practicality. Consequently, deracemization, the direct conversion of a racemic compound to one of its enantiomers, and thus characterized by a 100% atom efficiency, has attracted increasing interest. Recently, visible light&#8208;driven photocatalysis has been demonstrated as a promising platform for the development of deracemization. Central to its success can be attributed to its ability to efficiently overcome the prevailing kinetic issues in chemical transformations and the intrinsic thermodynamic challenges, which typically require the use of additional stoichiometric reagents and thus undermine the original advantage. In this review, the advances in this attractive area are systematically summarized and discussed, with examples organized according to the different modalities of energy transfer and single&#8208;electron transfer in photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Reaction of Diynamides with Allylic Alcohols: A Versatile Platform to Allenamide, 2&#8208;Aminofuran and Bridged [2.2.2]Octadiene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed divergent synthesis through alternation of the catalyst is appealing, as it provides an operationally simple way to access different valuable products, while using the same reactants as starting materials. Herein, a gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction of conjugated diynamides with allylic alcohols is described. By variation of the catalysts, substituted allenes and furans could be obtained selectively. Mechanistic studies indicate that, after the addition of allylic alcohol to gold&#8208;activated diynamide, a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement would take place and lead to the formation of a common reactive intermediate, which would further convert to the final products selectively. Further variation of the structure of diynamides has unveiled an additional reaction sequence involving intramolecular Himbert arene/allene Diels&#8722;Alder cycloaddition to afford a series of dearomatized products bearing bicyclo[2,2,2]octadiene core.</dc:description>

         <title>Insight into the Structural and Emissive Behavior of a 3&#8208;Dimensional Americium(III) Formate Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the structural, vibrational, and optical properties of americium formate (Am(CHO2)3) crystals synthesized via the in situ hydrolysis of dimethylformamide (DMF). The coordination polymer features Am3+ ions linked by formate ligands into a 3&#8208;dimensional network that is isomorphous to several lanthanide analogs, (e.g. Eu3+, Nd3+, Tb3+). Structure determination revealed a nine&#8208;coordinate Am3+ metal center that features a unique local C3v symmetry. The metal&#8208;ligand bonding interactions were investigated using infrared spectroscopy measurements, natural localized molecular orbital calculations, and the quantum theory of atoms in molecules. The results all paint a dominantly ionic bond picture and suggest the metal&#8208;oxygen bonds increase in strength from Nd&#8208;O &lt; Eu&#8208;O &lt; Am&#8208;O. The optical properties were probed using diffuse reflectance and photoluminescence spectroscopies. Notably, the rarely reported 5D1&#8242; &#8594; 7F1&#8242; emission band is observed and dominates the emission spectrum.

The coordination polymer features Am3+ ions linked by formate ligands into a 3-dimensional network that is isomorphous to several lanthanide analogs, (e.g. Eu3+, Nd3+, Tb3+). Structure determination revealed a nine-coordinate Am3+ metal center that features a unique local C3v symmetry. The metal-ligand bonding interactions were investigated using infrared spectroscopy measurements, natural localized molecular orbital calculations, and the quantum theory of atoms in molecules. The results all paint a dominantly ionic bond picture and suggest the metal-oxygen bonds increase in strength from Nd-O &amp;lt; Eu-O &amp;lt; Am-O. The optical properties were probed using diffuse reflectance and photoluminescence spectroscopies. Notably, the rarely reported 5D1&#8242; &#8594; 7F1&#8242; emission band is observed and dominates the emission spectrum. This behavior is unusual and is attributed to the C3v coordination environment of the metal center.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Site&#8208;selective Hydrogenation/Deuteration of Benzylic Olefins Enabled by Electroreduction Using Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe an operationally simple and user&#8208;friendly protocol that allows the site&#8209;selective hydrogenation and deuteration of di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted benzylic olefins by electroreduction while other groups prone to hydrogenation are present. The radical anionic intermediates react with the most inexpensive hydrogen/deuterium source H2O/D2O. Our method overcomes many limitations that arise from previously reported electro&#173;reductive hydrogenations. The applicability of this reaction is demonstrated by a broad substrate scope (&gt;50 examples) that focuses on functional group tolerance and sites that are affected by metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation (alkenes, alkynes, protecting groups).</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering the BASHY Dye Platform toward Architectures with Responsive Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of nine boronic&#8208;acid derived salicylidenehydrazone (BASHY) complexes was synthesized in good to very good chemical yields in a versatile three&#8208;component reaction. In extension to previous reports on this dye platform, the focus was put on the electronic modification of the &#8220;vertical&#8221; positions of the salicylidenehydrazone backbone. This enabled the observation of fluorescence quenching by photoinduced electron transfer (PeT), which can be reverted by the addition of acid in organic solvent (OFF&#8208;ON fluorescence switching). The resulting emission is observed in the green&#8208;to&#8208;orange spectral region (maxima at 520&#8211;590 nm). On the contrary, under physiological pH conditions in water the PeT process is inherently decativated, enabling the observation of fluorescence in the red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR region (maxima at 650&#8211;680 nm) with appreciable quantum yields and lifetimes. The latter characteristic supported the application of the dyes in fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of live A549 cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Overcoming Energy Transfer for the Metallophotoredox Catalyzed Decarboxylative Alkenylation between Alkylcarboxylic Acids and Enol Triflates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report on the decarboxylative alkenylation between alkyl carboxylic acids and enol triflates. The reaction is mediated by a dual catalytic nickel and iridium system, operating under visible light irradiation. Two competing catalytic pathways, from the excited state iridium photocatalyst, are identified. One is energy transfer from the excited state, resulting in formation of an undesired enol ester. The desired pathway involves electron transfer, resulting in decarboxylation to ultimately give the target product. The use of a highly oxidizing iridium photocatalyst is essential to control the reactivity. A diverse array of enol triflates and alkyl carboxylic acids are investigated, providing both scope and limitations of the presented methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>Composites of HKUST&#8208;1@Nanocellulose for gas&#8208;separation and dye&#8208;sorption applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, composites of HKUST&#8208;1 MOF with nanocellulose, HKUST&#8208;1@NCs, have been prepared and explored for CO2/N2 gas&#8208;separation and dye&#8208;sorption based applications. Our biopolymer&#8208;MOF composites are prepared via a copper ion pre&#8208;seeding method, in which, the HKUST&#8208;1 crystallites are grown in situ on the Cu&#8208;seeded and carboxylate anchored NC fibers for a better interfacial integration between the MOF and the polymer matrices. One of our HKUST&#8208;1@NC composites show ~300% enhancement in the CO2/N2 sorption selectivity. The same composite, C100, in the bulk powder form, shows a remarkable IAST sorption selectivity of 298 (CO2/N2) at 298 K and 1 bar for the CO2/N2 (15/85, v/v) gas mixture. The HKUST&#8208;1@NC composites have also been processed along with a polymeric cellulose acetate (CA) matrix as HKUST&#8208;1@NC@CA films to study them as free&#8208;standing mixed&#8208;matrix membranes. The CO2/N2 sorption selectivity, at 298 K and 1 bar is 600 for one such membrane, C&#8208;120@CA, as bulk sample studied by the static gas sorption. The composite, C120, exhibits a good uptake with an enhancement of 11% for alizarin and 70% for Congo red in comparison to the uptakes of the corresponding blank reference HKUST&#8208;1 sample, B120.</dc:description>

         <title>One, Two Three &#8211; Phosphaalkene Decoration Tailoring Solubility and Electronic Properties of Truxene&#8208;Based Electron Acceptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the functionalization and deplanarization of truxenes using pnictaalkene fragments. Selective introduction of one, two, or three Mes*&#8208;Pn fragments provides up to three fully reversible reductions based on the Pn=C fragments. The incorporation of the unsaturated heteroelement fragment as well as the contortion of the truxene core result in significantly red&#8208;shifted absorption spectra and interesting opto&#8208;electronic properties which are studied by electrochemistry and spectro&#8208;electrochemistry. Incorporation of arsaalkene (As=C) motifs gives significantly milder reduction potentials and red&#8208;shifted absorption, while phosphaalkene decorated truxene P3 can be functionalized using Au(I)Cl coordination. Furthermore, solubility is markedly increased upon incorporation of the Pn&#8208;Mes* fragments which renders these materials suitable for solution processing.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Alpha&#8208;Synuclein Proteins via Solid&#8208;Phase Peptide Synthesis and Native Chemical Ligation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alpha&#8208;Synuclein (&#945;&#8208;Synuclein) is a 140 amino acid protein implicated in neurodegenerative disorders known as synucleino&#8208;pathies, where it accumulates in proteinaceous inclusions in the brain. The normal physiological function of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein remains obscure, as it exists in several non&#8208;neuronal cells in which its function has not been studied. Given the tremendous interest in studying &#945;&#8208;Synuclein, and the existing limitations in the production of modified forms of the protein, we developed a method for the chemical synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein by combining peptide fragment synthesis via automated microwave&#8208;assisted solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis and ligation strategies. Our synthetic pathway enables the synthesis of protein variants of interest, carrying either mutations or posttranslational modifications, for further investigations of the effects on the structure and aggregation behavior of the protein. Ultimately, our study forms the foundation for future syntheses and studies of other custom&#8208;made &#945;&#8208;Synuclein variants with a single or several modifications, as necessary.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cytoplasm&#8208;Specific Fluorescent Ligand for Selective Imaging of RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes in Live Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of site&#8208;specific, target&#8208;selective and biocompatible small molecule ligands as a fluorescent tool for real&#8208;time study of cellular functions of RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s), which are associated with human cancers, is of significance in cancer biology. We report a fluorescent ligand that is a cytoplasm&#8208;specific and RNA G4&#8208;selective fluorescent biosensor in live HeLa cells. The in vitro results show that the ligand is highly selective targeting RNA G4s including VEGF, NRAS, BCL2 and TERRA. These G4s are recognized as human cancer hallmarks. Moreover, intracellular competition studies with BRACO19 and PDS, and the colocalization study with G4&#8208;specific antibody (BG4) in HeLa cells may support that the ligand is highly selective binding to G4s in cellulo. Furthermore, the ligand was demonstrated for the first time in the visualization and monitoring of dynamic resolving process of RNA G4s by the overexpressed RFP&#8208;tagged DHX36 helicase in live HeLa cells.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8220;Catch&#8208;Store&#8208;Release&#8221; Strategy for the Stabilization of 4,4&#8217;&#8208;Methylene Diphenyl Diisocyanate (4,4&#8217;&#8208;MDI)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>4,4&#8217;&#8208;Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) is an industrially crucial compound, being one of the most utilized linkers in the polyurethane industry. However, its long&#8208;term stability is limited due to dimerization to form insoluble uretdione. Herein we demonstrate an organometallic &#8220;catch&#8208;store&#8208;release&#8221; concept aiming at improving long&#8208;term chemical stability of MDI. Treatment of MDI with two equivalents of selected N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) forms stable MDI&#8208;NHC adducts. Treatment of the adducts with CuCl forms metastable di&#8208;Cu(I) complexes, which undergo decomposition to reform MDI (up to 85%), along with Cu&#8208;NHC complexes. The yield of reformed MDI can be improved (up to 95%) by the release of the NHC ligands in the form of thiourea, which prevents subsequent MDI dimerization/polymerization by the carbenes. Furthermore, the need to separate MDI from the reaction mixture can be eliminated by the direct reaction of MDI&#8208;NHC complexes with alcohols (as model for diols), which form dicarbamate (as model for polyurethane) quantitatively.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Lewis Acidity and Reactivity of Neutral Pentacoordinate&#160;Dithienophospholes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of luminescent, neutral pentacoordinate dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;d]phosphole compounds was synthesized by [4+1] cycloaddition of o&#8208;quinones with the trivalent corresponding phospholes. The electronic and geometrical modification of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated scaffold implemented here impacts the aggregation behavior of the species in solution. It proved successful in generating species with improved Lewis acidity of the phosphorus center that was then leveraged for small&#8208;molecule activation. Hydride abstraction from an external substrate involving the hypervalent species is followed by an intriguing P&#8208;mediated umpolung from the hydride to a proton and supports the catalytic potential of this class of main&#8208;group Lewis acids for organic chemistry. This study is a comprehensive investigation into various methods, including electronic, chemical, geometric modifications (and sometimes combinations of these approaches) to systematically improve the Lewis acidity of neutral and stable main&#8208;group Lewis acids with practical value for a range of chemical transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Fluorescent Carbon Dots (CDs) for the Selective detection of Metal&#8208;Containing Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pollution caused by heavy metals (HMs) may occur through both natural processes and anthropogenic activities and is found in complex media. The purpose of this review is to summarize the state&#8208;of&#8208;art of fluorescent CDs and the sensing applications in a systematic manner. This review intends to provide clues on the origin on the observed selectivity in chemiluminiscence sensors, which was until now a stated but unaddressed question, and still remains open for debate. Indeed, it is tempting to think that CDs possessing functional groups with soft bases at the surface are able to detect soft metal acids, while the opposite is to be suspected for hard acid&#8208;base pairs. However, the literature shows several examples where this trend does not hold. We found that such observation is explained by the involvement of dynamic quenching, which does not involve the formation of a non&#8208;fluorescent complex, as in the case of static quenching. We have provided an interpretation of published data that was not provided by the original authors and offer guidelines to enable the design of CDs to target ions in solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium Complexes of Polyfluorocarbon Substituted Terpyridine and Mesoionic Carbene Ligands: An Interplay in CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years terpyridines (tpy) and mesoionic carbenes (MIC) have been widely used in metal complexes. With the right combination with a metal center, both of these ligands are individually known to generate excellent catalysts for CO2 reduction. In this study, we combine the potentials of PFC (PFC = polyfluorocarbon) substituted tpy and MIC ligands within the same platform to obtain a new class of complexes, which we investigated with respect to their structural, electrochemical and UV/Vis/NIR spectroelectrochemical properties. We further show that the resulting metal complexes are potent electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction in which CO is exclusively formed with a faradaic efficiency of 92%. A preliminary mechanistic study, including the isolation and characterization of a key intermediate is also reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoting Plasmonic Hot Hole Extraction and Photothermal Effect for Oxygen Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boosting oxygen evolution reaction by local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) provides breakthrough opportunities for the promotion of solar energy conversion.The potential of LSPR&#160;has rarely been tapped and investigated. Here, we report the precise regulation of commercial Au nanoparticles&#160;plasmonic nanomaterial and OER electrocatalysts,&#160;viz., the NiCoOx&#160;electrocatalytic layer with hole transport ability and photothermal effect is prepared on the surface of Au nanoparticles by photoelectrodeposition. The NiCoOx&#160;layer not only increases the transmission distance of holes generated by plasmonic Au nanoparticles, but also reduce&#160;the agglomeration of plasmonic Au nanoparticles during long&#8208;time OER reaction, which greatly improves the OER catalytic ability. The current density of NiCoOx/Au anode&#160;is about 6.5&#160;times of pristine NiCoOx&#160;anode&#160;and 47 times of pristine Au anode&#160;at 2.0 V versus RHE.&#160;More importantly, with the LSPR and photothermal effect, the NiCoOx/Au anode provides additional current density of 7.01&#160;mA cm&#8208;2&#160;after illumination,&#160;and maintains no attenuation for more than 2000&#160;s. Benefiting from&#160;the solution of agglomeration problem of Au nanoparticles in the long&#8208;time OER process and the effective utilization of generated holes of Au nanoparticles, this design can provide guidance for the application of plasmonic materials in the field of electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Can Copper(I) and Silver(I) be Hydrogen Bond Acceptors?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen bonding with metals has recently been shown to take place with gold(I) compound. With the help of gas&#8208;phase IR spectroscopy and computational chemistry, we show, that similar interactions should exist also with Silver and Copper, with equipped with suitably designed ligands.







Abstract
Gold(I) centers can form moderately strong (Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H) hydrogen bonds with tertiary ammonium groups, as has been demonstrated in the 3AuCl+ (3+=1&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;4&#8208;(2&#8208;((dimethylammonio)methyl)phenyl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene) complex. However, similar hydrogen bonding interactions with isoelectronic silver(I) or copper(I) centers are unknown. Herein, we first explored whether the Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H bond originally observed in 3AuCl+ can be strengthened by replacing Cl with Br or I. Experimental gas&#8208;phase IR spectra in the &#8764;3000&#8197;cm&#8722;1 region showed only a small effect of the halogen on the Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H bond. Next, we measured the spectra of 3AgCl+, which exhibited significant differences compared to its 3AuX+ counterparts. The difference has been explained by DFT calculations which indicated that the Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H interaction is only marginal in this complex, and a Cl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H hydrogen bond is formed instead. Calculations predicted the same for the 3CuCl+ complex. However, we noticed that for Ag and Cu complexes with less flexible ligands, such as dimethyl(2&#8208;(dimethylammonio)phenyl)phosphine (L7H+), the computations predict the presence of the respective Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H and Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H hydrogen bonds, with a strength similar to the Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H bond in 3AuCl+. We, therefore, propose possible complexes where the presence of (Ag/Cu)&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H bonds could be experimentally verified to broaden our understanding of these unusual interactions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hydrogen bonding&lt;/b&gt; with metals has recently been shown to take place with gold(I) compound. With the help of gas-phase IR spectroscopy and computational chemistry, we show, that similar interactions should exist also with Silver and Copper, with equipped with suitably designed ligands.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold(I) centers can form moderately strong (Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H) hydrogen bonds with tertiary ammonium groups, as has been demonstrated in the &lt;b&gt;3AuCl&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

         <title>In Cellulo Light&#8208;Induced Dynamics in a BODIPY&#8208;Perylene Dyad</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BODIPY&#8208;based donor&#8208;acceptor dyads are widely used as sensors and probes in life science. Their biophysical properties have been well investigated in solutions, in which the photochemical and photophysical properties of these BODIPY dyads vary significantly in different environments. However, their photophysical properties in cellulo are generally understood less. To address this issue, the photoinduced dynamics of BODIPY derivatives were elucidated in live human cancer cells using sub&#8208;ns time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy.







Abstract
BODIPY&#8208;based donor&#8208;acceptor dyads are widely used as sensors and probes in life science. Thus, their biophysical properties are well established in solution, while their photophysical properties in cellulo, i.&#8201;e., in the environment, in which the dyes are designed to function, are generally understood less. To address this issue, we present a sub&#8208;ns time&#8208;resolved transient absorption study of the excited&#8208;state dynamics of a BODIPY&#8208;perylene dyad designed as a twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) probe of the local viscosity in live cells.

         <title>Control over Dethreading Kinetics Allows Evaluating the Entropy Stored in an Interlocked Molecular Machine Out&#8208;of&#8208;Equilibrium
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A minimal model of an acid&#8208;base powered molecular machine is studied, gaining control on its dethreading kinetics by engineering its components. Leveraging solvent properties, we could monitor the relaxation of the molecular machine from a high energy state to equilibrium. By measuring the heat exchanged in this process, we could confirm experimentally that such systems have a significant entropy content.







Abstract
The operation of nanomachines is fundamentally different from that of their macroscopic counterparts. In particular, the role of solvent is critical yet rarely associated with machine functionality. Here, we study a minimal model of one of the most advanced molecular machines to gain control of its operation by engineering components and the employed solvent. Operation kinetics were changed over more than four orders of magnitude and could be modulated by solvent. Leveraging solvent properties, it was possible to monitor the relaxation of the molecular machine towards equilibrium and measure the heat exchanged in the process. Our work expands the capabilities of acid&#8208;base powered molecular machines, confirming experimentally that such systems have a dominant entropy content.

         <title>NHC&#8208;Stabilised Parent Tripentelyltrielanes</title>

Three times the fun! The synthesis and characterisation of NHC&#8208;stabilised parent tripentelyltrielanes IDipp &#8901; E(PnH2)3 (E=Al, Ga; Pn=P, As) and triphosphanylindiumane IDipp &#8901; In(PH2)3 are presented (IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene), which were obtained by triple salt metathesis from IDipp &#8901; ECl3 and alkali metal pnictogenides. Coordination towards (HgC6F4)3 gave evidence of a first coordination compound.







Abstract
A missing family of the extremely air sensitive tripentelyltrielanes was discovered. Their stabilisation was achieved by using the bulky NHC IDipp (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene). The tripentelylgallanes and tripentelylalanes IDipp &#8901; Ga(PH2)3 (1&#8201;a), IDipp &#8901; Ga(AsH2)3 (1&#8201;b), IDipp &#8901; Al(PH2)3 (2&#8201;a) and IDipp &#8901; Al(AsH2)3 (2&#8201;b) were synthesised by salt metathesis of IDipp &#8901; ECl3 (E=Al, Ga, In) with alkali metal pnictogenides such as NaPH2/LiPH2 &#8901; DME and KAsH2, respectively. Moreover, the detection of the first NHC&#8208;stabilised tripentelylindiumane IDipp &#8901; In(PH2)3 (3) was possible by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. Initial investigations of the coordination ability of these compounds resulted in the successful isolation of the coordination compound [IDipp &#8901; Ga(PH2)2(&#956;3&#8208;PH2{HgC6F4}3)] (4) by reaction of 1&#8201;a with (HgC6F4)3. The compounds were characterised by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy as well as single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Supporting computational studies highlight the electronic features of the products.

         <title>Assessing Combinations of B(C6F5)3 and N2&#8208;Derived Molybdenum Nitrido Complexes for Heterolytic Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dinitrogen&#8208;derived nitrides have been explored as Lewis base component for frustrated Lewis pair type heterolytic bond splitting with B(C6F5)3 as the Lewis acid. d0 and d2 molybdenum nitrides both form stable adducts with B(C6F5)3. If Si&#8722;H bond splitting could be achieved, B&#8722;H bond activation of HB(C6F5)2 was not observed, this borane entering in competition with B(C6F5)3 to pair with the nitride without any further reactivity.







Abstract
Two different dinitrogen&#8208;derived molybdenum nitrido complexes varying by their geometry, ligand spheres and oxidations states were shown to engage their N ligand in dative bonding with the strong Lewis acid B(C6F5)3. The stable adducts were assessed for frustrated Lewis pair&#8208;type heterolytic E&#8722;H bond splitting of hydrosilanes (E=Si) and HB(C6F5)2. Whereas Si&#8722;H bond activation was achieved, HB(C6F5)2 was shown to substitute B(C6F5)3 in a quantitative or equilibrated fashion, depending on the nature of the nitrido complex.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dinitrogen-derived nitrides&lt;/b&gt; have been explored as Lewis base component for frustrated Lewis pair type heterolytic bond splitting with B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as the Lewis acid. d&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; molybdenum nitrides both form stable adducts with B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. If Si&#8722;H bond splitting could be achieved, B&#8722;H bond activation of HB(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was not observed, this borane entering in competition with B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to pair with the nitride without any further reactivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two different dinitrogen-derived molybdenum nitrido complexes varying by their geometry, ligand spheres and oxidations states were shown to engage their N ligand in dative bonding with the strong Lewis acid B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The stable adducts were assessed for frustrated Lewis pair-type heterolytic E&#8722;H bond splitting of hydrosilanes (E=Si) and HB(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Whereas Si&#8722;H bond activation was achieved, HB(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was shown to substitute B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in a quantitative or equilibrated fashion, depending on the nature of the nitrido complex. No B&#8722;H bond splitting was observed. Thermodynamics of these reactions, computed by DFT, are in agreement with the experimental outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Tetraarylethylenes Enabled by Reductive anti&#8208;1,2&#8208;Dimetallation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed anti&#8208;1,2&#8208;diarylation of diarylacetylenes is described. The key intermediates, trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;dizincioalkenes, are prepared by sodium&#8208;promoted reductive anti&#8208;1,2&#8208;dimagnesiation of alkynes and the subsequent transmetallation to zinc. The present reaction enables the stereoselective synthesis of tetraarylethylenes which have been difficult to prepare according to the conventional methods.







Abstract
Tetraarylethylenes (TAEs) have been gaining attention from various scientific disciplines for their characteristic chemical and physical properties. From the synthetic perspective, however, efficient methods for the selective synthesis of different isomers of TAEs are still underdeveloped. Here, we report the regio&#8208; and stereoselective synthesis of TAEs by means of sodium&#8208;promoted reductive anti&#8208;1,2&#8208;dimagnesiation of alkynes. Subsequent transmetallation to zinc generates trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;dizincioalkenes, which underwent the stereoselective arylation under a palladium catalysis to afford a variety of TAEs that had been difficult to prepare according to the conventional procedures. In addition, the present method accommodates not only diarylacetylenes but also alkyl aryl acetylenes and thus enables to synthesize a wide range of all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted alkenes.

         <title>Controlling the Flexibility of Carbazole&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks by Substituent Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological structures and properties of Cu&#8208;/Co&#8208;based MOFs with novel carbazole ligands are reported. The MOFs show high chemical stability, H2&#8208;adsorption performance, and CO2/N2 selectivity. The introduction of a strongly electron&#8208;donating substituent increases the structural robustness of the corresponding Cu&#8208;based MOFs. Thus, the flexibility of such MOFs can be controlled by the functional groups introduced at the periphery of the ligand backbone, which will serve as a new guideline for the design of advanced MOFs.







Abstract
We have developed highly porous Cu&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) using carbazole&#8208;type linkers. The novel topological structure of these MOFs was revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Molecular adsorption/desorption experiments indicated that these MOFs are flexible and change their structure upon adsorption/desorption of organic solvents and gas molecules. These MOFs exhibit unprecedented properties that allow controlling their flexibility by adding a functional group onto the central benzene ring of the organic ligand. For example, the introduction of electron&#8208;donating substituents increases the robustness of the resulting MOFs. These MOFs also exhibit flexibility&#8208;dependent differences in gas&#8208;adsorption and &#8208;separation performance. Thus, this study represents the first example of controlling the flexibility of MOFs with the same topological structure via the substituent effect of functional groups introduced into the organic ligand.

         <title>Unexpectedly Large Structural Variations in Benzyl&#8208;Substituted Sila[1]ferrocenophanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four related silicon&#8208;bridged [1]ferrocenophanes show large variations of the tilting of Cp rings in the crystal lattice. While the measured tilt angles range from 16.6 to 21.5&#176;, calculated values range from 19.6 to 20.8&#176;. With the help of DFT calculations, the unexpected experimental results are rationalized and placed into the contexts of known outliers of the sila[1]ferrocenophane family.







Abstract
A set of four planar&#8208;chiral sila[1]ferrocenophanes equipped with a benzyl group in the &#945;&#8208;position, either on one or both Cp rings, and substituted on the bridging silicon atom, either by methyl or phenyl groups, were prepared. While NMR, UV/Vis, and DSC measurements did not show anything uncommon, single crystal X&#8208;ray analyses revealed unexpectedly large variations of the dihedral angles between both Cp rings (&#945; tilt angle). While DFT calculations predicted &#945; between 19.6 and 20.8&#176;, measured values were found between 16.6(2) and 21.45(14)&#176;. However, experimentally determined conformers differ significantly from those calculated for the gas phase. For the sila[1]ferrocenophane with the largest mismatch between the experimental and predicted &#945; angle, it was shown that the orientation of benzyl groups have a significant influence on the ring&#8208;tilted structure. Packing of molecules in the crystal lattice forces benzyl groups into unusual orientations, resulting in a significantly reduced &#945; angle through steric repulsions.

         <title>Static Binding and Dynamic Transporting&#8208;Based Design of Specific Ring&#8208;Chain&#8208;Ring Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor: From Galantamine to Natural Product</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current theoretical&#8208;experimental work identifies hotspots for galantamine release and the most favourable transport mechanism. The compound with &#8220;ring&#8208;chain&#8208;ring&#8221; framework with detail beneficial modify scheme is summarized, which may improve the residence time of inhibitor in AChE. Based on dictamnine, three novel eligible derivatives are developed, which verifies the prediction. The present work provides a train of thought from static and dynamic view to modify or design appropriate inhibitor on the basis of specific binding and transportation features.







Abstract
Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a key target for the current symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and galantamine is a clinical anticholinesterase drug with transiently acting characteristic and good selectivity for AChE. The present theoretical&#8208;experimental work improves the drug&#8216;s residence time without reducing the inhibition effect, thus providing a crucial breakthrough for modifying the inhibitor of AChE with better kinetic behavior. The static binding and dynamic delivery properties acquired from atomic view reveal that the galantamine simply occupies a catalytic anionic site, and its release from AChE needs only &#8764;8.6&#8197;kcal/mol. Both of these may cause the short residence time of galantamine. The hotspots and most favorable transport mechanism are identified, and the hydrogen bond and aromatic stacking interactions are observed to play crucial roles for galantamine binding and release in AChE. The typical peripheral anionic site arisen at the delivery process would provide another key occupation to enhance the anti&#8208;release ability for inhibitors. The compound with &#8220;specific&#8208;ring&#8208;chain&#8208;ring&#8221; framework with detailed beneficial modification scheme is summarized, which may improve the residence time of the inhibitor in AChE. The thermodynamic and dynamic properties of galantamine derivatives are also studied. Based on dictamnine, a natural alkaloid, two novel eligible derivatives are designed, synthesized and evaluated, which verifies our prediction. Multiple computational approaches and experimental combinations probably provide a train of thought from both static and dynamic views to modify or design appropriate inhibitors on the basis of specific binding and transportation features.

         <title>Comprehensive Investigation of Anion Species in Crystalline Li+ ion Conductor Li27&#8722;x[P4O7+xN9&#8722;x]O3 (x&#8776;1.9(3))</title>

         <dc:description>
The structure of the crystalline lithium oxonitridophosphate Li27&#8722;x[P4O7+xN9&#8722;x]O3 contains three different anions, namely [PO2N2]5&#8722;, [PO3N]4&#8722;, and O2&#8722;. It was comprehensively investigated by single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, neutron powder diffraction, NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. A total ionic conductivity of 6.6&#215;10&#8722;8&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, which is similar to that of amorphous a&#8208;LiPON was determined with impedance spectroscopy.







Abstract
The Li+ ion conductor Li27&#8722;x[P4O7+xN9&#8722;x]O3 (x&#8776;1.9) has been synthesized from P3N5, Li3N and Li2O in a Ta ampoule at 800&#8201;&#176;C under Ar atmosphere. The cubic compound crystallizes in space group I
3d with a=12.0106(14) &#197; and Z=4. It contains both non&#8208;condensed [PO2N2]5&#8722; and [PO3N]4&#8722; tetrahedra as well as O2&#8722; ions, surrounded by Li+ ions. Charge neutrality is achieved by partial occupancy of Li positions, which was refined with neutron powder diffraction data. Measurements of the partial ionic and electronic conductivity show a total ionic conductivity of 6.6&#215;10&#8722;8&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 with an activation energy of 0.46&#177;0.02&#8197;eV and a bulk ionic conductivity of 4&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C, which is close to the ionic conductivity of amorphous lithium nitridophosphate. This makes Li27&#8722;x[P4O7+xN9&#8722;x]O3 an interesting candidate for investigation of structural factors affecting ionic conductivity in lithium oxonitridophosphates.

         <title>Extending the Palette of Green Coumarin Photocages &#8211; Oligonucleotide Fragmentation and Superior 5&#8217;&#8208;Caps</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We extend the possibilities of dicyanocoumarin (DCCM)&#8208;modified oligonucleotides to not just allow their release and therefore activation with green light (OFF &#8594; ON) but to also now offer a solution for their fragmentation after exposure to green light (ON &#8594; OFF). We further give an answer to the decreasing uncaging quantum yields often faced when working with red&#8208;shifted photocages and showed that rigidified DCCM 5&#8217;&#8208;caps outperform their predecessors. Those two new 5&#8217;&#8208;caps with ATTO 390 motif or julolidine core are compatible with copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloadditions (CuAACs) and therefore suitable for efficient caging through cyclization or for more bioconjugation reactions. Due to their planarization, they even experience an additional red&#8208;shift which is important for their use in biological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Semihydrogenation of Urea Derivatives to Formamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of CO2 as a non&#8208;toxic and cheap feedstock for C1 is a desirable route to achieve high value&#8208;added chemicals. In this context, we report a highly efficient ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed semihydrogenation reaction of CO2&#8208;derived ureas. Various alkyl and aryl urea derivatives were successfully hydrogenated to obtain the corresponding recyclable amines and formamides (up to 97% yield), highlighting the good substrate applicability of this method, which makes this method a sustainable alternative for the hydrogenation of CO2 to formamides in the presence of amines. In the meantime, we discover a new pathway that enables rapid hydrogenation of urea derivatives even at lower H2 pressure (&lt; 5 bar). This methodology might provide a new insight into the reduction functionalization of CO2 under mild pressure to form new C&#8208;N bond. Based on the control experiments and the observed intermediate products, we clarify the mechanism for selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of ureas.</dc:description>

         <title>Linkage Chemistry of SuFEx Linkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur(VI)&#8208;fluoride exchange linkage as a next generation of click chemistry was introduced by Sharpless et al. in 2014. Distinguished from CuAAC, the SuFEx reaction proceeds under metal&#8208;free conditions, and the reactive linkers are variable, enabling access to a diverse class of linkage compounds. Therein, a series of SuFEx linkers emerged has been widely prevalent in diverse fields. The SVI&#8208;F bond in comparison to SVI&#8208;Cl bond features excellent stability and chemoselectivity. The linkage chemistry primarily involves the formation of S&#8208;O and S&#8208;N bonds via commercially available phenols and amines, yet less study on C&#8208;SuFEx linkage. This review will focus on three types of linkage for SuFEx linkers comprising S&#8208;O, S&#8208;N, and S&#8208;C bonds, and we hope to provide a practical guidance for SuFEx linkage chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bioactive Synthetic Outer&#8208;Core Oligosaccharide Derived from a Klebsiella pneumonia Lipopolysaccharide for Bacteria Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemical synthesised outer core tetra&#8208; and pentasaccharide derived from the lipopolysaccharide of K. pneumoniae conjugated to the carrier proteins CRM197 and BSA elicited in mice antibodies that recognized isolated LPS as well as various strains of K. pneumoniae demonstrating they can induce relevant antigenic responses.







Abstract
There is an urgent need for new treatment options for carbapenem&#8208;resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), which is a common cause of life&#8208;threatening hospital&#8208; and community&#8208;acquired infections. Prophylactic or therapeutic vaccination may offer an approach to control these infections, however, none has yet been approved for human use. Here, we report the chemical synthesis of an outer core tetra&#8208; and pentasaccharide derived from the lipopolysaccharide of K. pneumoniae. The oligosaccharides were equipped with an aminopentyl linker, which facilitated conjugation to the carrier proteins CRM197 and BSA. Mice immunized with the glycoconjugate vaccine candidates elicited antibodies that recognized isolated LPS as well as various strains of K. pneumoniae. The successful preparation of the oligosaccharides relied on the selection of monosaccharide building blocks equipped with orthogonal hydroxyl and amino protecting groups. It allowed the differentiation of three types of amines of the target compounds and the installation of a crowded 4,5&#8208;branched Kdo moiety.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Labeling of RNAs with Modified and 19F&#8208;Labeled Nucleotides by Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of post&#8208;transcriptional modifications and synthetic modified nucleosides for the site&#8208;specific alteration of RNAs applying a chemo&#8208;enzymatic method is presented. This method overcomes the limitations of other established and well&#8208;known RNA synthesis techniques. The applicability of this approach to biological systems is demonstrated with the site&#8208;specific modification of a riboswitch with a fluorinated nucleoside for NMR based analyses.







Abstract
More than 170 post&#8208;transcriptional modifications of RNAs have currently been identified. Detailed biophysical investigations of these modifications have been limited since large RNAs containing these post&#8208;transcriptional modifications are difficult to produce. Further, adequate readout of spectroscopic fingerprints are important, necessitating additional labeling procedures beyond the naturally occurring RNA modifications. Here, we report the chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis of RNA modifications and several structurally similar fluorine&#8208;modified analogs further optimizing a recently developed methodology.[1] This chemo&#8208;enzymatic method allows synthesis of also large RNAs. We were able to incorporate 16 modified nucleotides and 6 19F&#8208;labeled nucleotides. To showcase the applicability of such modified large RNAs, we incorporated a 19F&#8208;labeled cytidine into the aptamer domain of the 2&#8217;dG sensing riboswitch (2&#8217;dG&#8208;sw) from Mesoplasma florum, enabling characterizing RNA fold, ligand binding and kinetics. Thanks to the large chemical shift dispersion of 19F, we can detect conformational heterogeneity in the apo state of the riboswitch.

         <title>Thermo&#8208;Induced Bathochromic Emission in Columnar Discotic Liquid Crystals Realized by Intramolecular Planarization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermo&#8208;induced bathochromic emission is achieved in columnar discotic liquid crystals realized by intramolecular planarization of the mesogenic fluorophores during the phase transition from hexagonal columnar to isotropic phases.







Abstract
Most organic thermochromic fluorescent materials exhibit thermo&#8208;induced hypsochromic emission due to the formation of excimers in ordered molecular solids; however, it is still a challenge to endow them with bathochromic emission despite its significance in making up the field of thermochromism. Here, a thermo&#8208;induced bathochromic emission in columnar discotic liquid crystals is reported realized by intramolecular planarization of the mesogenic fluorophores. A three&#8208;armed discotic molecule of dialkylamino&#8208;tricyanotristyrylbenzene was synthesized, which preferred to twist out of the core plane to accommodate ordered molecular stacking in hexagonal columnar mesophases, giving rise to bright green monomer emission. However, intramolecular planarization of the mesogenic fluorophores occurred in isotropic liquid increasing the conjugation length, and as a result led to thermo&#8208;induced bathochromic emission from green to yellow light. This work reports a new concept in the thermochromic field and provides a novel strategy to achieve fluorescence tuning from intramolecular actions.

         <dc:description>
Plasmonic photocatalysis for CO2 reduction attracts increasing attention because it represents a promising strategy for effective CO2 storage and conversion, which holds great potential for real applications. In this review, the remarkable progresses on plasmonic photocatalytic CO2 reduction and the general design principles of efficient plasmonic photocatalysts are discussed.







Abstract
Plasmonic photocatalysis for CO2 reduction is attracting increasing attention due to appealing properties and great potential for real applications. In this review, the fundamentals of plasmonic photocatalysis and the most recent developments regarding its application in driving CO2 reduction are reported. Firstly, we present the review on the mechanism of plasmonic photocatalytic CO2 reduction, the energy transfer of plasmon, and the CO2 reduction process on the catalyst surface. Then, the modulation on the plasmonic nanostructures and also the semiconductor counterpart to regulate CO2 photoreduction is discussed. Next, the influence of the core&#8208;shell structure and the interface between the plasmonic metal and semiconductor on the CO2 photoreduction performance is also outlined. In addition, the latest progress on the emerging direction regarding the plasmonic photocatalysis for methane dry reforming with CO2 is especially emphasized. Finally, a summary on the challenges and prospects of this promising field are provided.

         <title>Enhancing the Activity of an Alcohol Dehydrogenase by Using &#8220;Aromatic Residue Scanning&#8221; at Potential Plasticity Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy, named &#8220;aromatic residue scanning&#8221;, was developed for enzyme engineering, and an alcohol dehydrogenase was engineered to exhibit higher activity and substrate tolerance based on the implementation of the strategy to randomly mutate five identified potential plasticity sites. By using the best variant, an efficient bioprocess for the synthesis of (S)&#8208;2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1&#8208;(3,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)ethanol was established.







Abstract
An alcohol dehydrogenase LkADH was successfully engineered to exhibit improved activity and substrate tolerance for the production of (S)&#8208;2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1&#8208;(3,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)ethanol, an important precursor of ticagrelor. Five potential hotspots were identified for enzyme mutagenesis by using natural residue abundance as an indicator to evaluate their potential plasticity. A semi&#8208;rational strategy named &#8220;aromatic residue scanning&#8221; was applied to randomly mutate these five sites simultaneously by using tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine as &#8220;exploratory residues&#8221; to introduce steric hindrance or potential &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. The best variant Lk&#8208;S96Y/L199W identified with 17.2&#8208;fold improvement in catalytic efficiency could completely reduce up to 600&#8197;g/L (3.1&#8197;M) 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1&#8208;(3,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)ethenone in 12&#8197;h with &gt;99.5&#8201;%&#8201;ee, giving the highest space&#8208;time yield ever reported. This study, therefore, offers a strategy for mutating alcohol dehydrogenase to reduce aromatic substrates and provides an efficient variant for the efficient synthesis of (S)&#8208;2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1&#8208;(3,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)ethanol.

         <title>Benzopyrano&#8208;Fused Phenanthridine&#8208;Based Columnar Mesogens: Synthesis, Self&#8208;organization and Charge&#8208;Transport Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel heteroaromatic, elliptical dimers self&#8208;assembling into rarely observed columnar oblique mesophase have been synthesized. The derivatives were found to exhibit good ambipolar charge transport properties and the dimers are highly fluorescent, displaying interesting optical properties.







Abstract
Columnar mesogens constitute a fascinating class of supramolecular nano&#8208;architectures owing to the exceptional properties induced by their self&#8208;assembling behavior. Extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugated core in such systems by incorporating heteroatoms extensively influences their mesomorphic, photophysical properties, etc., presenting them as potential candidates for optoelectronic applications. In the present work, a series of novel nitrogen and oxygen&#8208;incorporated chromenonaphthophenanthridine&#8208;based elliptical dimers have been synthesized through tandem Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization followed by ipso&#8208;aromatic substitution in one&#8208;pot. Mesophase characterization has been carried out by employing POM, DSC, and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Photophysical properties were investigated using UV&#8208;vis and emission spectroscopy. Furthermore, the charge transport properties were analyzed by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight measurements, and the observed ambipolar mobilities were found to be of the order of 10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. The high solubility, excellent thermal stability, self&#8208;organizing properties, and ambipolar charge transport characteristics make them promising candidates for applications in organic electronics.

         <title>Structural Engineering of Red Luminogens to Realize High Emission Efficiency through ACQ&#8208;to&#8208;AIE Transformation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Two &#8220;V&#8208;shaped&#8221; red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR organic luminogens, FITPA and FIMPA, were developed. The &#8220;V&#8208;shaped&#8221; configurations have been demonstrated to enhance the transition dipole moments. Moreover, the ACQ&#8208;to&#8208;AIE transformation from FITPA to FIMPA is induced by a methoxy&#8208;substitution strategy. The enhanced transition dipole moment and AIE behavior endow FIMPA intense luminescence in the solid state. Furthermore, the promising cell&#8208;imaging performance verified the great potential of FIMPA in biological applications.







Abstract
Deep red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR, &gt;650&#8197;nm) emissive organic luminophores with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behaviours have emerged as promising candidates for applications in optoelectronic devices and biological fields. However, the molecular design philosophy for AIE luminogens (AIEgens) with narrow band gaps are rarely explored. Herein, we rationally designed two red organic luminophores, FITPA and FIMPA, by considering the enlargement of transition dipole moment in the charge&#8208;transfer state and the transformation from aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) to AIE. The transition dipole moments were effectively enhanced with a &#8220;V&#8208;shaped&#8221; molecular configuration. Meanwhile, the ACQ&#8208;to&#8208;AIE transformation from FITPA to FIMPA was induced by a methoxy&#8208;substitution strategy. The experimental and theoretical results demonstrated that the ACQ&#8208;to&#8208;AIE transformation originated from a crystallization&#8208;induced emission (CIE) effect because of additional weak interactions in the aggregate state introduced by methoxy groups. Owing to the enhanced transition dipole moment and AIE behaviour, FIMPA presented intense luminescence covering the red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR region, with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of up to 38&#8201;% in solid state. The promising cell&#8208;imaging performance further verified the great potential of FIMPA in biological applications. These results provide a guideline for the development of red and NIR AIEgens through comprehensive consideration of both the effect of molecular structure and molecular interactions in aggregate states.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Tetraphenylethene (TPE)&#8208;Based Fluorophores Derived by &#960;&#8208;Extended Systems: Opposite Mechanofluorochromism, Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting and Bioimaging</title>

Two unprecedented 4,5&#8208;bis(tetraphenylethene)&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;fused pyridine or quinoline&#8208;based fluorophores X&#8208;1 and X&#8208;2 were designed and synthesized, and X&#8208;1 and X&#8208;2, exhibit completely opposite mechanofluorochromic behavior.







Abstract
Although remarkable progresses are achieved in the design and development of the mono&#8208;shift in photoluminescence for mechanofluorochromic materials, it is still a severe challenge to explore the opposite mechanofluorochromic materials with both blue&#8208; and red&#8208;shifted photoluminescence. Herein, two unprecedented 4,5&#8208;bis(TPE)&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole fused pyridine or quinoline&#8208;based fluorophores X&#8208;1 and X&#8208;2 were designed and synthesized, and X&#8208;1 and X&#8208;2, exhibit completely opposite mechanofluorochromic behavior. Under UV lamp, the color of pristine X&#8208;1 changed from blue to green with reversible redshifted 27&#8197;nm in fluorescence emission spectra after ground, while the color of pristine X&#8208;2 changed from red to yellow with reversible blue&#8208;shifted 74&#8197;nm after ground. The detailed characterizations (including PXRD, SEM and DSC) confirmed that this opposite mechanofluorochromism was attributed to the transformation of order&#8208;crystalline and amorphous states. The crystal structure analysis and theoretical calculation further explain that opposite mechanofluorochromic behavior take into account different &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking mode by induced &#960;&#8208;extended systems. In addition, these TPE&#8208;based fluorophores (X&#8208;1 and X&#8208;2) exhibited excellent bio&#8208;compatibility and fluorescence properties for bio&#8208;imaging, writable data storage and anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials.

         <title>Marigold Flower&#8208;Shaped Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Supported Manganese Vanadium Oxide Electrocatalyst for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reactions in an Alkaline Medium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Marigold flower&#8208;shaped metal&#8211;organic framework assisted manganese vanadium oxide was synthesized using a facile hydrothermal approach and employed as electrocatalysts for electrochemical water oxidation. The electrocatalytic activity and stability of MOF MnV oxide microflower toward O2 evolution processes are superior. Water electrolyzers based on MOF MnV oxide microflower catalyst are comparable to those based on commercial IrO2 catalysts.







Abstract
The electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key process in many renewable energy systems. The development of low&#8208;cost, long&#8208;lasting alternatives to precious&#8208;metal catalysts, particularly functional electrocatalysts with high activity for OER processes, is crucial for reducing the operating expense and complexity of renewable energy generating systems. This work describes a concise method for generating marigold flower&#8208;like metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) aided manganese vanadium oxide via a hydrothermal procedure for increased OER activity. As synthesized MOF MnV oxide has a higher surface area due to the 3D flower&#8208;like structure, which is reinvented with enhanced electrocatalytic active sites. These distinctive structural features result in remarkable catalytic activity for MOF MnV oxide microflowers towards OER with a low overpotential of 310&#8197;mV at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope with only 51.4&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 in alkaline conditions. This study provides a concise method for developing an optimized catalytic material with greater morphology and beneficial features for potential energy and environmental applications.

The molecular solar thermal (MOST) energy storage system 2&#8208;carbethoxy&#8208;3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;norbornadiene/quadricyclane was investigated on Pt(111) and Ni(111) by synchrotron radiation&#8208;based XPS measurements. The in&#8208;situ observation of the adsorption at &#8764;120&#8197;K allowed the distinction of both valence isomers. Temperature&#8208;programmed experiments gave insights into thermally induced reactions and stability boundaries.







Abstract
Novel energy&#8208;storage solutions are necessary for the transition from fossil to renewable energy sources. Auspicious candidates are so&#8208;called molecular solar thermal (MOST) systems. In our study, we investigate the surface chemistry of a derivatized norbornadiene/quadricyclane molecule pair. By using suitable push&#8211;pull substituents, a bathochromic shift of the absorption onset is achieved, allowing a greater overlap with the solar spectrum. Specifically, the adsorption and thermally induced reactions of 2&#8208;carbethoxy&#8208;3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;norbornadiene/quadricyclane are assessed on Pt(111) and Ni(111) as model catalyst surfaces by synchrotron radiation&#8208;based X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Comparison of the respective XP spectra enables the distinction of the energy&#8208;rich molecule from its energy&#8208;lean counterpart and allows qualitative information on the adsorption motifs to be derived. Monitoring the quantitative cycloreversion between 140 and 230&#8197;K spectroscopically demonstrates the release of the stored energy to be successfully triggered on Pt(111). Heating to above 300&#8197;K leads to fragmentation of the molecular framework. On Ni(111), no conversion of the energy&#8208;rich compound takes place. The individual decomposition pathways of the two isomers begin at 160 and 180&#8197;K, respectively. Pronounced desorption of almost the entire surface coverage only occurs for the energy&#8208;lean molecule on Ni(111) above 280&#8197;K; this suggests weakly bound species. The correlation between adsorption motif and desorption behavior is important for applications of MOST systems in heterogeneously catalyzed processes.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite&#8208;Like MA3Bi2I9 for Photo&#8208;Catalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite&#8208;like: A new MA3Bi2I9 photo&#8208;catalyst for the production of hydrogen using photo&#8208;catalysis is described. The MA3Bi2I9 photo&#8208;catalyst is eco&#8208;friendly and cost&#8208;effective for the production of hydrogen. The structural properties of the MA3Bi2I9 photo&#8208;catalyst were determined by XRD and SEM. The MA3Bi2I9 photo&#8208;catalyst showed excellent photo&#8208;catalytic properties for the generation of hydrogen.







Abstract
In this study, a highly air stable and eco&#8208;friendly methyl ammonium bismuth iodide (MA3Bi2I9) perovskite&#8208;like material has been prepared. After physiochemical characterizations, the synthesized MA3Bi2I9 was utilized as photo&#8208;catalyst towards hydrogen production. It is important to design and synthesize lead (Pb)&#8208;free perovskite&#8208;like material (MA3Bi2I9) for photo&#8208;catalytic hydrogen&#8208;production applications. The synthesized MA3Bi2I9 exhibits excellent photo&#8208;catalytic hydrogen generation with a production rate of 11.43&#8197;&#956;molg&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. In the presence of a platinum co&#8208;catalyst, the hydrogen production rate further increases to 172.44&#8197;&#956;molg&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. The MA3Bi2I9 photo&#8208;catalyst also demonstrates excellent cyclic stability.

         <title>Heterocyclic Hemipiperazines: Water&#8208;Compatible Peptide&#8208;Derived Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitching in presence of water: decoration of cyclic dipeptides with heteroarylidene substituents produces novel biocompatible molecular photoswitches. They show high thermal stability, and are operational under aqueous conditions with an organic co&#8208;solvent. Extended heteroaromatic system enables bidirectional switching with visible light.







Abstract
Hemipiperazines are a recently discovered class of peptide&#8208;derived molecular photoswitches with high biocompatibility and therapeutic potential. Here, for the first time we describe photochromism of heterocyclic hemipiperazines. They demonstrate long thermal lifetimes, and enlarged band separation between photoisomers. Efficient photoisomerization occurs under aqueous conditions, although with a need for organic co&#8208;solvent. Bidirectional switching with visible light is observed for an extended aromatic system.

         <title>Revealing the Crystal Phase&#8208;Activity Relationship on NiRu Alloy Nanoparticles Encapsulated in N&#8208;Doped Carbon towards Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal phase&#8208;activity relationship of NiRu nanoparticles is studied employing the N&#8208;doped carbon shell coated NiRu nanoparticles with different phase contents. The hcp phase NiRu has better HER performance, and the NiRu@NC (mix) with rich (&#8764;70&#8201;%) hcp phase presented outstanding performance with an overpotential of only 27&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a low Tafel slope of 42&#8197;mV&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;dec&#8722;1.







Abstract
Adjusting the crystal phase of a metal alloy is an important method to optimize catalytic performance. However, detailed understanding about the phase&#8208;property relationship for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is still limited. In this work, the crystal phase&#8208;activity relationship of NiRu nanoparticles is studied employing N&#8208;doped carbon shell coated NiRu nanoparticles with different phase contents. It is found that the NiRu@NC (mix) with both face&#8208;centred cubic (fcc) and thermodynamically unstable hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) phase NiRu give the best HER performance. Further activity studies demonstrate that hcp NiRu has better HER performance, and NiRu@NC (mix) with rich (&#8764;70&#8201;%) hcp phase presented outstanding performance with an overpotential of only 27&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The high HER activity of NiRu@NC (mix) is attributed to the formation of hcp phase. This finding indicates that the regulation of crystal structure can provide a new strategy for optimizing HER activity.

         <title>Cooperativity&#8208;Driven Reactivity of a Dinuclear Copper Dimethylglyoxime Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cooperativity at the crossroad: The two copper centers in the dinuclear copper(II) dimethylglyoxime complex work in concert to facilitate ligand hydrolysis that yields butane&#8208;2,3&#8208;dione monoxime and NH2OH. The fate of NH2OH depends on the solvent used, in CH3CN, for example, NH2OH is oxidized to N2O yielding [Cu(CH3CN)4]+ as reduced species. In ethanol, however, NH2OH is reduced to NH4+, which in turn yields acetaldehyde as oxidized species. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Becker and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203438).

         <title>A Template&#8208;free Pd2L4 Cage with up to Nanomolar Affinity for Chloride in Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective binding of chloride over other most abundant anions in living organisms is pivotal due to its essential role in physiological functions. Herein we report a template&#8208;free Pd2L4 cage exhibiting high selectivity for medium&#8208;sized halides (i.e., Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;) in water owing to the size&#8208;discriminatory nature of the cage cavity. In pure water, this cage displays high selectivity, and micromolar affinity for chloride. The cage shows no binding towards other biologically more abundant essential anions such as phosphates, carboxylates, and bicarbonate. This cage shows an unprecedented nanomolar affinity with 1:1 binding stoichiometry for chloride in aqueous&#8208;DMSO media. This high affinity was achieved with the best use of traditional hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions as confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. This well&#8208;defined cage sequestrates F&#8722; by cleaving B&#8722;F bond from BF4&#8722; in a facile manner in non&#8208;polar solvent media or in the presence of excess ligand. This cage also demonstrates sub&#8208;ppm level chloride capture that is present in commercial D2O samples.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>2&#8208;Methylisoborneol is a widespread musty odourant that is produced by many bacteria including actinomycetes, cyanobacteria and myxobacteria. Two 2&#8208;methylisoborneol synthases (MIBS) that are phylogenetically distant to the known enzyme from Streptomyces coelicolor were found to be highly active for 2&#8208;methylisoborneol biosynthesis. Based on the enzyme structure and on an amino acid sequence alignment, the MIBS from S. coelicolor was extensively studied through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Atroposelective Nenitzescu Indole Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the helix&#8208;shaped vines growing in the garden, as well as for many bioactive molecules and other three&#8208;dimensional objects, chirality is an essential and ubiquitous property. The synthetic control of atropoisomerism along C&#8722;N bonds is particularly rare and challenging, however. A simple CrIII&#8211;salen complex was nevertheless used as a chiral enantiopure catalyst for a highly atroposelective Nenitzescu indole synthesis. More information can be found in the Research Article by F.&#8197;W. Patureau and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300279).

         <title>Co2+ to Al3+ Substitution Induced Dual&#8208;Site Synergistic Catalysis to Friedel&#8208;Crafts Alkylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple Co2+ to Al3+ substitution in Al4B6O15 lattice leads to the dual&#8208;site synergistic catalysis, that is the Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation reaction between &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene adsorbed and activated at the Lewis acidic site (unsaturated Co2+) and the indole molecule, which is activated by an adjacent reactive oxygen species.







Abstract
The dual&#8208;site synergistic effect in heterogeneous catalysis is quite interesting, and also complex because at least two substrate molecules are adsorbed or activated on the catalyst surface, which apparently needs two spatially separated and functionally independent active sites. It would become more difficult when the substrate molecules are large ones. The replacement of Al3+ in Al4B6O15 lattice with Co2+ leads to the formation of unsaturated Co2+ (4&#8208;fold coordination) along with oxygen vacancies (Ov). The former one behaves as a medium&#8208;strength Lewis acid site, and can adsorb and activate molecules with a nitro group (e.&#8201;g., &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene). The latter one can adsorb and activate oxygen species, which further activates the indole derivatives. Next, the spatially separated dual sites on the catalyst surface can synergistically and efficiently catalyze their Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation reactions under mild conditions. The high durability can be proved by the as&#8208;maintained high yields, that is, 98, 93, 96, 92 and 90&#8197;% for 5 runs, respectively. The reaction kinetics obey the second&#8208;order characteristic. Annealing under hydrogen condition can further generate more surficial Ov, leading to an improvement to the catalytic activity. A simple and probably routine aliovalent doping endows such a complex synergistic catalysis involving two large substrate molecules, providing an inspired perspective of developing dual&#8208;site catalysts.

Synthesis of 2&#8208;(4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl) phenol using 10&#8208;CSA catalyst.

Abstract
We report the synthesis of 2&#8208;(4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenol (TPI&#8208;9) as an interesting fluorescent molecule displaying Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular&#8208;Proton&#8208;Transfer (ESIPT) with stokes shift of 120&#8197;nm. Phenolic compounds with the ability to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds and subsequent proton transfer are known as ESIPT fluorophores. Proton accepting ability can increase significantly by tailoring electron&#8208;donating groups. With the assistance of an environment&#8208;friendly organocatalyst, 10&#8208;camphor sulfonic acid (10&#8208;CSA), TPI&#8208;9 was synthesized to introduce substituents with electron&#8208;donating abilities to develop an efficient ESIPT mechanism. Factors influencing the emission, such as solvent, pH, and metal ions, are investigated. Quenching of fluorescence by Cu2+ through chelation enhancement quenching effect with a high selectivity allowed the establishment of a Cu2+ sensor with an LoD of 0.57&#8197;ppm and a ratiometric estimation with an LoD of 0.73&#8197;ppm. Metal binding (2&#8201;:&#8201;1) stoichiometry and quenching constant (0.0072&#8197;mol&#8722;1s&#8722;1) are calculated from Job's and Stern&#8208;Volmer plots. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are in accordance with the experimental results. Competitive replacement of TPI&#8208;9 by amino acids restores ESIPT, consequently, the fluorescence. Thus, an &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescence sensor for amino acid estimation is developed under 1 minute incubation. A linear relationship between amino acid concentration and fluorescence intensity is in 0&#8208;20&#8197;&#956;g/mL range, and the LoD is less than 2.2&#8197;&#956;g/mL.

         <title>Coumarin C&#8722;H Functionalization by Mn(I) Carbonyls: Mechanistic Insight by Ultra&#8208;Fast IR Spectroscopic Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards &#960;&#8208;extended hybrid coumarin&#8208;pyridinium compounds: We have developed a remarkable methodology for the synthesis of hybrid coumarin&#8208;pyridinium compounds using Mn(I) carbonyl chemistry. The system was found suitable for forensic examination of the key steps underpinning CO loss, alkyne coordination and insertion, and subsequent reductive elimination, which were quantifiable by time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic methods.







Abstract
Mn(I) C&#8722;H functionalization of coumarins provides a versatile and practical method for the rapid assembly of fused polycyclic pyridinium&#8208;containing coumarins in a regioselective manner. The synthetic strategy enables application of bench&#8208;stable organomanganese reagents in both photochemical&#8208; and thermal&#8208;promoted reactions. The cyclomanganated intermediates, and global reaction system, provide an ideal testing ground for structural characterization of the active Mn(I) carbonyl&#8208;containing species, including transient species observable by ultra&#8208;fast time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic methods. The thermodynamic reductive elimination product, solely encountered from reaction between alkynes and air&#8208;stable organometallic cyclomanganated coumarins, has enabled characterization of a critical seven&#8208;membered Mn(I) intermediate, detected by time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy, enabling the elucidation of the temporal profile of key steps in the reductive elimination pathway. Quantitative data are provided. Manganated polycyclic products are readily decomplexed by AgBF4, opening&#8208;up an efficient route to the formation of &#960;&#8208;extended hybrid coumarin&#8208;pyridinium compounds.

         <dc:description>
&#8220;This study brings C&#8722;N atroposelectivity outside of the hands of a few methodology experts, and into the hands of general organic chemists, biochemists, medicinal chemists, etc.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202300279).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue is the group of Frederic&#8197;W. Patureau at the RWTH Aachen University. The image depicts atropoisomerism, in particular through the helix&#8208;shaped vines in the forefront focus. This metaphorically illustrates the importance of atroposelectivity in biologically active molecules, such as in the 5&#8208;hydroxyindoles that were accessed through the first enantioselective Nenitzescu indole synthesis.

         <title>Orbital Nature of Carboionic Monoradicals Made from Diradicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monoradical cations and anions made by redox electron transfer on neutral diradicals and both with different sign charges stabilized in an identical &#960;&#8208;conjugated platform are understood from a dual perspective as provided by molecular orbital theory and valence bond theory. Their solid&#8208;state structures and optical properties as well as their validity for ambipolar charge transport are discussed.







Abstract
The electronic, optical, and solid state properties of a series of monoradicals, anions and cations obtained from starting neutral diradicals have been studied. Diradicals based on s&#8208;indacene and indenoacenes, with benzothiophenes fused and in different orientations, feature a varying degree of diradical character in the neutral state, which is here related with the properties of the radical redox forms. The analysis of their optical features in the polymethine monoradicals has been carried out in the framework of the molecular orbital and valence bond theories. Electronic UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR absorption, X&#8208;ray solid&#8208;state diffraction and quantum chemical calculations have been carried out. Studies of the different positive&#8208;/negative&#8208;charged species, both residing in the same skeletal &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone, are rare for organic molecules. The key factor for the dual stabilization is the presence of the starting diradical character that enables to indistinctively accommodate a pseudo&#8208;hole and a pseudo&#8208;electron defect with certainly small reorganization energies for ambipolar charge transport.

         <title>Modular Principle for Complex Disordered Tetrahedral Frameworks in Quenched High&#8208;Pressure Phases of Phosphorus Oxide Nitrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Data analysis proved even more challenging than data acquisition, as crystallites notoriously contain intergrown domains of two phases.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202203892).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are the groups of Oliver Oeckler at Leipzig University and Wolfgang Schnick at University of Munich (LMU). The image background depicts a diffraction pattern of an intergrown crystal containing P40O31N46 as a night sky. P40O31N46 and P74O59N84 form complex disordered frameworks, a cutout of which symbolizes the earth's surface (which mainly contains silicates with related building blocks). The structures are built up from chain&#8208;like building units, which fall like rain, symbolizing the modular building scheme. Read the full text of the article at 10.1002/chem.202203892.

         <title>Exploring Zr&#8208;based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks as Smart Electrochromic Sensors by Coordination&#8208;Driven Surface Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As emerging stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, electrochromic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are still not utilized in sensing applications due to difficulties in water stability, facile synthesis and functionalization, and efficient translation of specific recognition events. Here, we firstly find that a Zr&#8208;based MOF furnished with postsynthetically created viologen&#8208;like electron&#8208;deficient moiety was electrochromic active. With a coordination&#8208;driven surface engineering strategy where phosphate&#8208;containing biomolecules are tethered to Zr nodes of the MOF, fine tuning the interface electron transfer was readily achieved, thus benefitting for constructing smart electrochromic sensors through the combination of the sensitivity of electrochemistry with the visuality of colorimetry. Particularly, MOF&#8208;coated conductive films enabled label&#8208;free detection of phosphoproteins, and aptamer&#8208;functionalized ones responded specifically to the target. In two cases distinct color changes allow for visual quantification. This study represents the first example of MOF&#8208;based electrochromic sensors developed by an efficient strategy, indicating the generality to electrochromic counterparts for various sensing applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic amides can be used to construct light&#8208;harvesting materials with valuable optical properties. The amide bond is formed using well&#8208;known coupling agents in near quantitative yield, as illustrated here through the synthesis of two boron dipyrromethene derivatives bearing an amide linkage. The primary concern with acyl amides is rotation around the C&#8208;N bond, leading to cis and trans isomers. Using NMR spectroscopy, quantum chemical calculations and critical comparison to simpler benzamides, the stereochemistry of the target compounds has been addressed. The N&#8208;cyclohexyl derivative gave diffraction quality crystals that established a trans geometry for the amide bond. Quantum chemical calculations support the trans geometry as being the lowest&#8208;energy structure in solution but indicate that inversion of the aryl ring is an important structural feature. Indeed, rotation around the C(sp2)&#8208;C(aryl) bond has a strong influence on the solution&#8208;phase NMR spectra. The amide connection has minimal effect on the photophysical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Induced Single&#8208;Crystal to Single&#8208;Crystal Transformation of Ionic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks with Enhanced Proton Conductivity</title>

Single crystal to single crystal transition: This study reports the synthesis of two hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) and the transformation of iHOF&#8208;10 to iHOF&#8208;11. The results show that water molecules induce the single crystal to single crystal transition process, as well as increase the proton conductivity.







Abstract
Two ionic hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (iHOF&#8208;10, iHOF&#8208;11) were prepared using 1,1&#8242;&#8208;diamino&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine diiodide (Dbpy&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2I) and tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfophenyl)ethylene (H4TPE). With increasing RH and temperature, water molecules induce single crystal to single crystal (SCSC) transformation of iHOF&#8208;10, resulting in the formation of iHOF&#8208;11. At 90&#8201;&#176;C, 98&#8201;% RH, the proton conductivity of iHOF&#8208;11 (7.03&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) is 2.09 times higher than iHOF&#8208;10 (3.37&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1). At 50&#8201;&#176;C, 98&#8201;% RH, iHOF&#8208;11 (9.49&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) is 19.06 times higher than iHOF&#8208;10 (4.98&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1). The proton conductivity shows water molecules enter the crystal and induce crystal transformation and reorganization of the hydrogen bonding structure, thus increasing the proton conductivity and stability.

         <title>Selective Oxidation of Methane to Oxygenates using Oxygen via Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 17, March 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective oxidation of methane to oxygenates using low&#8208;cost and environment&#8208;friendly molecular oxygen (O2) under mild reaction conditions is a promising strategy but still remains grand challenge. This Concept article highlights the main strategies employed to transform methane to oxygenates with O2 as oxidant coupling with in&#8197;situ generation of H2O2.







Abstract
Selective oxidation of methane to oxygenates using low&#8208;cost and environment&#8208;friendly molecular oxygen (O2) under mild reaction conditions is a promising strategy but still remains grand challenge. It is of great importance to accelerate the activation of O2 to generate highly active oxygen species, such as hydroxyl peroxide and hydroxyl species to improve catalytic performance for selective oxidation of methane. Selective oxidation of methane using O2 by coupling with in&#8197;situ generation of hydrogen peroxide via tandem catalysis ensures the easy formation of active oxygen species for methane activation, leading to high oxygenates productivity under mild conditions. In this concept, we summarized the recent progresses for selective oxidation of methane to oxygenates using O2 based on tandem catalysis by coupling with in&#8197;situ generation of hydrogen peroxide. The remaining challenges and future perspectives for selective oxidation of methane to oxygenates via tandem catalysis were also proposed.

Metal&#8208;organic framework or smoked meat sandwiches? A novel orthogonalized aryl&#8208;phosphonate linker is used to direct formation of porous open frameworks. The network structures are highly dependent on the inclusion and structure of the guest aromatic compounds.







Abstract
The reliable self&#8208;assembly of microporous metal&#8208;phosphonate materials remains a longstanding challenge. This stems from, generally, more coordination modes for the functional group allowing more dense structures, and stronger bonding driving less crystalline products. Here, a novel orthogonalized aryl&#8208;phosphonate linker, 1,3,5&#8208;tris(4&#8217;&#8208;phosphono&#8208;2&#8217;,6&#8217;&#8208;dimethylphenyl) benzene (H6L3) has been used to direct formation of open frameworks. The peripheral aryl rings of H6L3 are orthogonalized relative to the central aromatic ring giving a tri&#8208;cleft conformation of the linker in which small aromatic molecules can readily associate. When coordinated to magnesium ions, a series of porous crystalline metal&#8208;organic, and hydrogen&#8208;bonded metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs, HMOFs) are formed (CALF&#8208;41 (Mg), HCALF&#8208;42 (Mg), &#8208;43 (Mg)). While most metal&#8208;organic frameworks are tailored based on choice of metal and linker, here, the network structures are highly dependent on the inclusion and structure of the guest aromatic compounds. Larger guests, and a higher stoichiometry of metal, result in increased solvation of the metal ion, resulting in networks with connectivities increasingly involving hydrogen&#8208;bonds rather than direct phosphonate coordination. Upon thermal activation and aromatic template removal, the materials exhibit surface areas ranging from 400&#8211;600&#8197;m2/g. Self&#8208;assembly in the absence of aromatic guests yields mixtures of phases, frequently co&#8208;producing a dense 3&#8208;fold interpenetrated structure (1). Interestingly, a series of both more porous (530&#8211;900&#8197;m2/g), and more robust solids is formed by complexing with trivalent metal ions (Al, Ga, In) with aromatic guest; however, these are only attainable as microcrystalline powders. The polyprotic nature of phosphonate linkers enables structural analogy to the divalent analogues and these are identified as CALF&#8208;41 analogues. Finally, insights to the structural transformations during metal ion desolvation in this family are gained by considering a pair of structurally related Co materials, whose hydrogen&#8208;bonded (HCALF&#8208;44 (Co)) and desolvated (CALF&#8208;44 (Co)) coordination bonded networks were fully structurally characterized.

While most metal-organic frameworks are tailored based on choice of metal and linker, here, the network structures are highly dependent on the inclusion and structure of the guest aromatic compounds. Larger guests, and a higher stoichiometry of metal, result in increased solvation of the metal ion, resulting in networks with connectivities increasingly involving hydrogen-bonds rather than direct phosphonate coordination.

         <title>Ab Initio Metadynamics Simulations of Hexafluoroisopropanol Solvent Effects: Synergistic Role of Solvent H&#8208;Bonding Networks and Solvent&#8208;Solute C&#8722;H/&#960; Interactions</title>

         <dc:description>
Ab initio metadynamics simulations under explicit solvent environments were performed to investigate the promotion effect of HFIP solvent in Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation and Cope rearrangement reactions. The H&#8208;bonding network and the HFIP&#8208;substrate C&#8722;H/&#960; interaction are identified as the major factors affecting reactivity.







Abstract
The solvent effects in Friedel&#8211;Crafts cycloalkylation of epoxides and Cope rearrangement of aldimines were investigated by using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Explicit molecular treatments were applied for both reactants and solvents. The reaction mechanisms were elucidated via free energy calculations based on metadynamics simulations. The results reveal that both reactions proceed in a concerted fashion. Key solvent&#8208;substrate interactions are identified from the structures of transition states with explicit solvent molecules. The remarkable promotion effect of hexafluoroisopropanol solvent is ascribed to the synergistic effect of H&#8208;bonding networks and C&#8722;H/&#960; interactions with substrates.

         <title>In Situ X&#8208;ray Diffraction Studies on the Reduction of V2O5 and WO3 by Using Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 17, March 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ X&#8208;ray powder diffraction was used to investigate the reduction of WO3 to WO2 and V2O5 to V2O3 under hydrogen gas with regard to intermediate oxides and bronzes as well as influence of the heating and hydrogen&#8208;flow rates.







Abstract
The reduction of metal oxides with hydrogen is widely used for the production of fine chemicals and metals both on the laboratory and industry scale. In situ methods can help to elucidate reaction pathways and to gain control over such synthesis reactions. In this study, the reduction of WO3 and V2O5 with hydrogen was investigated by in situ X&#8208;ray powder diffraction with regard to intermediates and the influence of heating rates and hydrogen flow rates. Mixtures of V4O9, V6O13 and VO2 in two modifications were identified as intermediates on the way to phase&#8208;pure V2O3. None of the intermediates occurs in a single phase and therefore cannot be prepared this way. In contrast, the intermediates of the WO3 reduction, H0.23WO3 and W10O29, appear consecutively and can be isolated. For both reactions, the heating and flow rates have little influence on the formation of intermediates.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of trans&#8208;anti&#8208;Hydrophenanthrenes via Ti&#8208;mediated Radical Cyclization and Total Synthesis of Kamebanin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 17, March 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diastereoselective synthesis of the functionalized trans&#8208;anti&#8208;hydrophenanthrenes via Ti&#8208;mediated reductive radical cyclization has been developed. This method enabled the convergent total synthesis of nebularilactone A and the first total synthesis of kamebanin via a novel formal semi&#8208;pinacol rearrangement reaction and an unprecedented Thorpe&#8208;Ziegler&#8208;type D&#8208;ring formation reaction.







Abstract
Ent&#8208;kaurenes consist of an ABC&#8208;ring based on a trans&#8208;anti&#8208;hydrophenanthrene skeleton and a D ring with an exomethylene. Highly oxygen&#8208;functionalized ent&#8208;kauren&#8208;15&#8208;ones have promising antiinflammatory pharmacological activity. In this study, we developed a novel diastereoselective synthesis of trans&#8208;anti&#8208;hydrophenanthrenes via a Ti&#8208;mediated reductive radical cyclization. We also demonstrated the applicability of this method by developing the first total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;kamebanin (longest linear sequence; 17&#8197;steps, overall yield; 6.5&#8201;%). Furthermore, this synthesis provided a formal semi&#8208;pinacol rearrangement for the construction of the quaternary carbon at C8 and a novel Thorpe&#8208;Ziegler&#8208;type reaction for the construction of the D&#8208;ring.

         <title>Reagent&#8208;Controlled Regioselective Intramolecular [2+2] Cycloaddition between Vinylsilanes and Allenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 17, March 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unprecedented intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition reaction between allenes and silicon&#8208;bearing olefins is presented. This is also the first example of the reagent&#8208;controlled regioselective [2+2] cycloaddition of allenes. The products in this work were oil compounds. The crystal sponge method was successfully used to determine their structures.







Abstract
This paper provides the first report of the intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition of vinylsilane. The [2+2] cycloaddition of allenes is a useful reaction that can synthesize cyclobutanes. However, no previous works have attempted to control the regioselectivity between the two double bonds of allenes only by changing the reaction conditions, although there have been some reports of the regioselective [2+2] cycloaddition of allenes by changing the substrate. In this study, we have succeeded in controlling intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition reactions at the proximal and distal positions of allenes simply by changing the reaction conditions. We found that the atomic radius of silicon is very important for perfect control of the reaction's sites. The structures of all key compounds were determined by the crystal sponge method which could identify the structures of liquid compounds.

         <title>Synthesis of a Bifunctionalized Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) Anchor Useful for the Study of GPI Biology</title>

A bifunctional glycosylphosphatidylinositol derivative containing photoactivable and clickable groups was synthesized by a convergent strategy.







Abstract
A new, bifunctional glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) derivative containing the highly conserved core structure of all natural GPI anchors with a photoactivable diazirine in the lipid chain and clickable alkynes in the glycan was synthesized by a convergent [3+2] glycosylation strategy with late stage protecting group manipulation and regioselective phosphorylation. The challenges of this synthesis were due to the presence of several distinctive functional groups in the synthetic target, which complicated the protection tactics, in addition to the inherent difficulties associated with GPI synthesis. This bifunctional GPI derivative can cross&#8208;react with molecules in proximity upon photoactivation and be subsequently labeled with other molecular tags via click reaction. Therefore, it should be a valuable probe for biological studies of GPIs, such as analysis of GPI&#8208;interacting membrane proteins, and gaining insights into their functional mechanisms.

         <title>Fluorinated Dihydropentalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;Dione: A Strong Electron&#8208;Accepting Unit with Organic Semiconductor Characteristics</title>

Toward D&#8208;A&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules: Fluorinated pentalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione (FPD), a strong electron&#8208;accepting unit was designed, and a derivative that contains a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8722;A&#8722;D) conjugated molecule for use in organic semiconducting materials is reported. The compound was characterized based on its electrochemical properties, photophysical properties, and X&#8208;ray analyses to elucidate the structure&#8211;property relationships of the compounds.







Abstract
The development of electron&#8208;accepting units is of significant importance because the construction of donor (D)&#8208;acceptor (A) configurations is an effective strategy for tuning the electronic properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. Although doubly fused pentagons represented by diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) have been used as an effective electron&#8208;accepting unit, the relatively high&#8208;lying frontier molecular orbital levels (FMOs) leave room for further improvement. We report herein the synthesis of a fluorinated dihydropentalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione (FPD) derivative as a strong electron&#8208;accepting unit and the development of D&#8722;A&#8722;D &#960;&#8208;extended molecules. X&#8208;ray analyses revealed that the presence of fluorine atoms contributed to the formation of high planar structures and slipped&#8208;stacked packing. Electrochemical measurements indicated that the FPD derivatives showed relatively lower FMO energy levels than the corresponding DPP&#8208;containing derivatives. The D&#8722;A&#8722;D molecule based on terthiophene and FPD showed semiconducting responses. This study demonstrates that the FPD unit can function as a new acceptor unit for organic semiconductors.

         <title>Synthesis of Thioesters from Aldehydes via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) Catalyzed Radical Relay</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 17, March 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient reaction has been developed for thioesterification of aldehydes via radical relay by NHC catalysis. The key step is the coupling of the Breslow radical cation with the heteroatom radical (sulfur&#8208;radical). The excellent yields and broad substrate scope illustrated the efficiency of this strategy for achieving novel reactions via NHC catalysis.







Abstract
We have developed an efficient N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed thioesterification of aldehydes using N&#8208;thiosuccinimides as the thiolation reagent. This organocatalyzed transition involves the generation of sulfur radicals by single electron transfer of the Breslow enolate (generated from aldehyde and NHC catalyst) with N&#8208;thiosuccinimides. This method offers facile access to various highly functionalized thioesters and exhibits good chemical yields and functional group tolerance.

An organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite photoelectric multifunctional material: [C7H13ONCH2F] PbBr3 (1) was successfully designed and synthesised. It realized the coupling of thermo&#8208;dielectric switching characteristics, semiconductor characteristics and photoluminescence characteristics of STE broadband emission.







Abstract
One dimensional (1D) organic&#8208;inorganic halide hybrid perovskites have the advantages of excellent organic cation modifiability and diversity of inorganic framework structures, which cannot be ignored in the development of multi&#8208;functional phase&#8208;transition materials in photoelectric and photovoltaic devices. Here, we have successfully modified and synthesized an organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite photoelectric multifunctional phase&#8208;transition material: [C7H13ONCH2F]&#8901;PbBr3 (1). The synergistic effect of the order double disorder transition of organic cations and the change of the degree of distortion of the inorganic framework leads to its high temperature reversible phase&#8208;transition point of Tc=374&#8197;K/346&#8197;K and its ultra&#8208;low loss high&#8208;quality dielectric switch response. Through in&#8208;depth research and calculation, compound 1 also has excellent semiconductor characteristics with a band gap of 3.06&#8197;eV and the photoluminescence characteristics of self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) broadband emission. Undoubtedly, this modification strategy provides a new choice for the research field of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite reversible phase&#8208;transition photoelectric multifunctional materials with rich coupling properties.

A new three&#8208;component procedure for the polychloromethylaminative synthesis of &#946;&#8208;polychloromethyl amines has been developed. With simple styrenes, polychloromethanes, and aromatic amines as substrates, saturated &#946;&#8208;dichloromethyl amines were isolated in moderate to good yields by using aryldiazonium salt as radical initiator.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling reaction has been developed allowing the rapid building of valuable complex highly functionalized &#946;&#8208;polychloromethyl amines from simple styrenes, arylamines, and dichloromethane/chloroform. Using aryldiazonium salts as a radical initiator, a series of corresponding products are obtained with moderate to good yields under a carbon dioxide or nitrogen atmosphere (50&#8197;psi). In addition, good functional group tolerance can be observed.

         <title>Fast Motions Dominate Dynamics of Intrinsically Disordered Tau Protein at High Temperatures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 17, March 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reorientational dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) at low temperatures are composed of multiple components such as segmental motions and local conformational fluctuations. Temperature&#8208;dependent spectral density analysis of 15N&#8197;NMR relaxation rates demonstrates that local backbone and relaxation&#8208;active segmental chain dynamics of IDPs might merge into an effectively single dynamic component at sufficiently high temperatures.







Abstract
Reorientational dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) contain multiple motions often clustered around three motional modes: ultrafast librational motions of amide groups, fast local backbone conformational fluctuations and slow chain segmental motions. This dynamic picture is mainly based on 15N&#8197;NMR relaxation studies of IDPs at relatively low temperatures where the amide&#8208;water proton exchange rates are sufficiently small. Less is known, however, about the dynamics of IDPs at more physiological temperatures. Here, we investigate protein dynamics in a 441&#8208;residue long IDP, tau protein, in the temperature range from 0&#8211;25&#8201;&#176;C, using 15N&#8197;NMR relaxation rates and spectral density analysis. While at these temperatures relaxation rates are still better described in terms of amide group librational motions, local backbone dynamics and chain segmental motions, the temperature&#8208;dependent trend of spectral densities suggests that the timescales of fast backbone conformational fluctuations and slower chain segmental motions might become inseparable at higher temperatures. Our data demonstrate the remarkable dynamic plasticity of this prototypical IDP and highlight the need for dynamic studies of IDPs at multiple temperatures.

Our data demonstrate the remarkable dynamic plasticity of this prototypical IDP and highlight the need for dynamic studies of IDPs at multiple temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
A clean and efficient electrochemical method for the preparation of 3&#8208;thio/selenocyanatobenzothiophenes has been developed. This method features excellent functional group compatibility, broad substrate scope and easy to scale&#8208;up in continuous flow.







Abstract
A novel and green method for the synthesis of 3&#8208;thiocyanatobenzothiophenes via electrochemical&#8208;oxidation promoted difunctionalization of active alkyne has been developed. In this protocol, inexpensive and easily available potassium thiocyanate was chosen as the thiocyanation reagent, 2&#8208;alkynylthioanisoles as the substrates, a variety of 3&#8208;thiocyanatobenzothiophenes were obtained in moderate to good yields under oxidant&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free conditions. Moreover, the continuous flow system has good applicability for this transformation, the use of continuous flow system has overcome the disadvantage of low efficiency in traditional electrochemical amplification, and realized the stable and excellent yields of target products in the scale&#8208;up reactions.

         <title>Fe&#8208;Catalyzed Aliphatic C&#8722;H Methylation of Glycine Derivatives and Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 17, March 22, 2023. </description>

A concise strategy relying on multifunctional iron catalysis in the presence of di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide has been reported, allowing rapid and highly selective C(sp3)&#8722;H methylation of various glycine derivatives and peptides.







Abstract
Direct and selective C&#8722;H methylation is a powerful tool with which to install methyl groups into organic molecules, and is particularly useful in pharmaceutical chemistry. However, practical methods for such modification of biologically interesting targets have been rarely developed. We here report an iron&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H methylation reaction of glycine derivatives, peptides and drug&#8208;like molecules in an alcohol in the presence of di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide. A readily available iron catalyst plays multiple roles in the transformation, which accelerates oxidation of C&#8722;N bonds to C=N double bonds, activates imine intermediates as Lewis acids by bidentate chelation, and at the same time facilitates cleavage of the peroxide to generate methyl radicals. A variety of methylated N&#8208;aryl glycine derivatives and peptides were obtained in good yield and with excellent chemo&#8208; and site&#8208;selectivity. This reaction is scalable, easily managed, and can be completed within 1&#8211;2&#8197;h. It features an economic, bio&#8208;friendly catalyst, a green solvent and low toxic reagents, and will provide effective access to precise C&#8722;H modification of biomolecules and natural products.

Travelling without moving: A Ferrier rearrangement/aza&#8208;Wacker cyclization on commercial glycals allows both a 3,4&#8208;cis amination at position three and a motion of the double bound restoring the glycal. Epoxidation/glycosylation of N&#8208;Ts 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxygalactal provided disaccharide with high diastereoselectivity and yield, thus defining FAWEG (Ferrier/Aza&#8208;Wacker/Epoxidation/Glycosylation) as a new sequence to access 1,2&#8208;trans 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycosides.







Abstract
3&#8208;Amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycosides constitute an essential class of nitrogen&#8208;containing sugars. Among them, many important 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycosides possess a 1,2&#8208;trans relationship. In view of their numerous biological applications, the synthesis of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycosyl donors giving rise to a 1,2&#8208;trans glycosidic linkage is thus an important challenge. Even though glycals are highly polyvalent donors, the synthesis and reactivity of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycals have been little studied. In this work, we describe a new sequence, involving a Ferrier rearrangement and subsequent aza&#8208;Wacker cyclization that allows the rapid synthesis of orthogonally protected 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycals. Finally a 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxygalactal derivative was submitted for the first time to an epoxidation/glycosylation with high yield and great diastereoselectivity, highlighting FAWEG (Ferrier/Aza&#8208;Wacker/Epoxidation/Glycosylation) as a new approach to access 1,2&#8208;trans 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycosides.

         <title>Three&#8208; and Five&#8208;Membered Anionic Chains of Pnictogenylboranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 17, March 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;membered chains of substituted anionic compounds composed of both boron and pnictogen (phosphorus and/or arsenic) atoms are synthesized from the reaction of pnictogenide salts with H2E&#8722;BH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NMe3 (E=P, As). Such compounds can be further reacted with H2E&#8722;BH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NMe3 to form unprecedented five&#8208;membered anionic group 13/15 oligomers.







Abstract
An unprecedented family of three&#8208; and five&#8208;membered substituted anionic derivatives of parent pnictogenylboranes is herein reported. Reacting various combinations of the pnictogenylboranes H2E&#8242;&#8722;BH2&#8722;NMe3 (E&#8242;=P, As) with pnictogen&#8208;based nucleophiles MER1R2 (E=P, As; R1=H, R2=tBu; R1=R2=Ph; M=Na, K) allows for the isolation of the unsymmetrical products [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][H2E&#8242;&#8722;BH2&#8722;EHtBu] (3: E=E&#8242;=P; 4: E=E&#8242;=As; 5: E=As, E&#8242;=P) and [M(C)][H2E&#8242;&#8722;BH2&#8722;EPh2] (7: E=E&#8242;=P, M=Na, C=18&#8208;crown&#8208;6; 8: E=E&#8242;=As; M=K, C=[2.2.2]cryptand; 9: E=P, E&#8242;=As, M=Na, C=[2.2.2]cryptand; 10: E=As, E&#8242;=P, M=K, C=[2.2.2]cryptand). [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][H2As&#8722;BH2&#8208;tBuPH&#8722;BH3] (6) is only accessible by a different pathway, using tBuPH2, BH3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SMe2 and NaNH2 as starting materials. Additionally, the synthesis of symmetrical diphenyl&#8208;substituted compounds [M(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][Ph2E&#8722;BH2&#8722;EPh2] (11: E=P, M=Na; 12: E=As, M=K) is reported which can be regarded as isostructural inorganic, negatively charged analogs of dppm (1,1&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)methane) and dpam (1,1&#8208;bis(diphenylarsino)methane). Furthermore, an elongation of the pnictogen boron backbone in compounds 3, 7 and 9&#8242; (similar compound to 9, stabilized however by 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6), is attainable by reacting them with the pnictogenylboranes H2E&#8242;&#8722;BH2&#8722;NMe3 leading to corresponding five&#8208;membered chain&#8208;like compounds [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][H2E&#8722;BH2&#8722;R1R2P&#8722;BH2&#8722;E&#8242;H2] (E=E&#8242;=P, R1=H, R2=tBu (13); E=E&#8242;=P, R1=R2=Ph (14); E=E&#8242;=As, R1=R2=Ph (15); E=P, E&#8242;=As, R1=R2=Ph (16)). Finally, the thermodynamics of the reaction pathways were evaluated by quantum chemical computations.

Reacting various combinations of the pnictogenylboranes H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&#8242;&#8722;BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;NMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (E&#8242;=P, As) with pnictogen-based nucleophiles MER1R2 (E=P, As; R1=H, R2=&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Bu; R1=R2=Ph; M=Na, K) allows for the isolation of the unsymmetrical products [Na(18-crown-6)][H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&#8242;&#8722;BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;EH&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;Bu] (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;: E=E&#8242;=P; &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;: E=E&#8242;=As; &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;: E=As, E&#8242;=P) and [M(C)][H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&#8242;&#8722;BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;EPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;: E=E&#8242;=P, M=Na, C=18-crown-6; &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;: E=E&#8242;=As; M=K, C=[2.2.2]cryptand; &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;: E=P, E&#8242;=As, M=Na, C=[2.2.2]cryptand; &lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt;: E=As, E&#8242;=P, M=K, C=[2.2.2]cryptand). [Na(18-crown-6)][H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;As&#8722;BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;BuPH&#8722;BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;) is only accessible by a different pathway, using &lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;BuPH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NaNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as starting materials. Additionally, the synthesis of symmetrical diphenyl-substituted compounds [M(18-crown-6)][Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&#8722;BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;EPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;11&lt;/b&gt;: E=P, M=Na; &lt;b&gt;12&lt;/b&gt;: E=As, M=K) is reported which can be regarded as isostructural inorganic, negatively charged analogs of dppm (1,1-bis(diphenylphosphino)methane) and dpam (1,1-bis(diphenylarsino)methane). Furthermore, an elongation of the pnictogen boron backbone in compounds &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;&#8242; (similar compound to &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;, stabilized however by 18-crown-6), is attainable by reacting them with the pnictogenylboranes H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&#8242;&#8722;BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;NMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; leading to corresponding five-membered chain-like compounds [Na(18-crown-6)][H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&#8722;BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;R1R2P&#8722;BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;E&#8242;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (E=E&#8242;=P, R1=H, R2=&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Bu (&lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt;); E=E&#8242;=P, R1=R2=Ph (&lt;b&gt;14&lt;/b&gt;); E=E&#8242;=As, R1=R2=Ph (&lt;b&gt;15&lt;/b&gt;); E=P, E&#8242;=As, R1=R2=Ph (&lt;b&gt;16&lt;/b&gt;)).

         <title>Recognizing the Minimum Structural Units Driving the Crystallization of SAPO&#8208;34 in a Top&#8208;Down Process</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 17, March 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A top&#8208;down synthesis system was designed to study the crystallization of SAPO&#8208;34. Based on characterizations on a clear precursor solution with abundant nuclei and designed synthesis experiments, it was demonstrated that the formation of small species containing Si&#8722;O&#8722;Al bonds is crucial for driving the crystallization of SAPO&#8208;34, rather than structural units with specific spatial conformation.







Abstract
Recognizing the structure and nature of the nuclei for zeolites crystallization on an atomic level is of great importance, which can provide guidance on the control of crystallization kinetics and the rational synthesis of zeolites. However, it remains a long&#8208;standing challenge due to the difficulty in characterization of amorphous precursor with limited crystal nuclei. Herein, a top&#8208;down synthesis system was designed for SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieve and well investigated. A clear precursor solution with abundant SAPO&#8208;34 crystal nuclei was obtained under a depolymerization&#8208;dominant condition. The species in the liquid precursor were identified by FT&#8208;ICR MS, solid&#8208;state MAS NMR and atomic pair distribution function analyses. In combination with various designed experiments, it is revealed that both the formation of small species containing Si&#8722;O&#8722;Al bonds and reaching a certain concentration, is crucial for driving the crystallization of SAPO&#8208;34, rather than structural units with specific spatial conformation. This work provides an important understanding on the (pre)nucleation of SAPO&#8208;34 and sheds light on the synthesis control of SAPO molecular sieves.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Release of Secondary Amine Bases for the Activation of Catalysts and Crosslinkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 17, March 22, 2023. </description>

Apart from their properties as self&#8208;healing materials, DCv ureas can be applied as starting points for triggered reaction cascades. Input such as heat and water can release free base on demand. We apply this release system for the deprotection of a latent organocatalyst to catalyse acylhydrazone formation as well as for on&#8208;demand gelation.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent (DCv) ureas have been used abundantly to design self&#8208;healing materials. We demonstrate that apart from self&#8208;healing materials, the species present in the equilibrium of DCv ureas can be employed as responsive organocatalysts. Easily controllable stimuli like heat or addition of water shift the equilibrium towards isocyanate and free base which can function as an in situ released reagent. We demonstrate this application of DCv ureas with two examples. Firstly, we use the liberated base to catalytically activate a latent organocatalyst for acylhydrazone formation. Secondly, this base can be employed in an equimolar manner to trigger the release of nitrile&#8208;N&#8208;oxides from chlorooximes, which react with acrylate&#8208;terminated polymers to form an isoxazoline polymer gel.

Collaborative work: The synthesis of a new monoboranyl ligand scaffold is described. This ambiphilic diphosphine allows for the cooperative coordination of organonitriles in partnership with nickel(0).







Abstract
Metal&#8208;ligand cooperation has emerged as a versatile tool for substrate activation in chemical reactivity. Herein, we provide the synthesis and characterization of a monoboranyl&#8208;containing analogue of the ubiquitous bulky diphosphine ligand, 1,2&#8208;bis(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphino)ethane, whose reactivity has been examined using nickel. Together, the pairing of nickel and boron provides a platform that allows for the cooperative coordination of organonitriles, giving unusual examples of intermolecularly bound dinickelacycles.

         <title>Highly Fluorescent Supramolecular Nanoring Composed of Bent&#8208;Shaped Cyanostilbene Derivatives and Cucurbit[8]urils</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 17, March 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we materialized zero dimensional supramolecular organic framework with enhanced emission. We designed bent&#8208;shape guest molecule by novel backbone &#8220;cyanostilbene&#8221;. This unique bent&#8208;shape molecule only emitted enhanced fluorescence with cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) as a host in water. This nano&#8208;confined emissive molecule also formed homogeneous system without bundling at the high concentration when it became complex with CB[8].







Abstract
Supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) made of organic guest molecule and cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) in aqueous solution have great potential for diverse applications. Herein, we designed highly fluorescent zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) nano&#8208;ring SOF with CB[8] as a host and novel bent&#8208;shaped cyanostilbene guest. This host&#8211;guest complex successfully formed macrocyclic hexamer and showed significantly enhanced fluorescence (&#934;F=68&#8201;%) compared to non&#8208;assembled monomer (&#934;F=2&#8201;%). Unlike other SOFs, this 0D SOF could be dispersed uniformly without bundling phenomenon in water.

         <title>Trace Explosive Detection Based on Photonic Crystal Amplified Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 17, March 22, 2023. </description>

Trace TNT detection enabled by the amplification effect of photonic crystal on fluorescence signals is achieved. The photonic crystal&#8208;based sensor chips can sense trace explosive TNT in different environments, including air, environmental wastewater, and contaminated soil.







Abstract
With increasing demand for public security and environmental protection, it is highly desirable to develop strategies to identify trace explosives (e.&#8201;g., 2,4,6&#8208;trinitrotoluene (TNT)). Herein, we report novel photonic crystal (PC)&#8208;based sensor chips for trace TNT detection by using amplification effect of PCs on fluorescence (FL) signals. The sensor chips are constructed by integrating silica nanoparticles (NPs) modified with (3&#8208;aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) and fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer (FITC) and PC substrates. The amino groups on FITC&#8208;APTES&#8208;silica NPs can specifically bind with TNT molecules to form Meisenheimer complexes and strongly quench the FL signal of neighboring fluorophores FITC through F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer. PCs with matched PBG can amplify the FL signal of FITC&#8208;APTES&#8208;silica NPs about 24.4&#8208;fold and significantly improve sensitivity and resolution of trace TNT detection with the limit of detection of 0.23&#8197;nM. The PC&#8208;based sensor chips are stable, sensitive, and reliable TNT sensing platforms, showing great potential in homeland safety and environmental protection.

         <title>Phosphorus&#8208;Boron Multiple Bonding in the &#960; Radical HBP</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 17, March 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multiply bonded &#960; radical HBP has been generated and characterized for the first time. Bonding analysis suggest that it differs from the isovalent HNB since the unpaired electron occupies one of the doubly degenerate &#960; bonding MOs, resulting in a B&#8722;P bond order of two and half.







Abstract
The HBP radical was generated via the reaction of laser ablated boron atom with PH3 in a solid neon matrix, which is identified via IR spectroscopy with isotopic substitutions and quantum chemical calculations. The results show that HBP has a 2&#928; electronic ground state with a short B&#8722;P bond. Bonding analysis indicates that besides an electron&#8208;sharing &#963; bond, there are two degenerate &#960; bonding orbitals that are occupied by three electrons, resulting in a bond order of two and half between P and B. This is in sharp contrast to the bonding properties of the isovalent HNB, which was characterized to be a N&#8801;B triply bonded &#963; radical with the unpaired electron locating on the B atom.

         <title>Chromatic Selectivity of Coumarin&#8208;Caged Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 17, March 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of green&#8208;light activatable DCCM photo&#8208;tethers allows efficient photocaging of oligonucleotides. In addition, DCCM can be used in combination with conventional blue&#8208;light absorbing DEACM to build an &#8220;orthogonal&#8221; system. It was suggested to rather use the term &#8220;chromatic selectivity&#8221; for which the necessary equations were provided. These showed that chromatic selectivity can even be adjusted by careful choice of starting material.







Abstract
A system of two coumarin&#8208;based caging groups is presented &#8211; one absorbing in the blue (400&#8211;450&#8197;nm) and the other absorbing in the green (480&#8211;550&#8197;nm) part of the visible spectrum. Together they form a pair, which allows to selectively photoactivate the one or the other in oligonucleotides. A numerical characterization defining the term &#8220;chromatic selectivity&#8221; was proposed, and it was shown how chromatically selective uncaging can literally be titrated in a kinetic reaction scheme.

Abstract
A series of hitherto unknown 5,14&#8208;diphenylbenzo[j]naphtho[2,1,8&#8208;def][2,7]phenanthrolines, containing a 5&#8208;azatetracene and a 2&#8208;azapyrene subunit, were prepared by combination of Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions with a one&#8208;pot Povarov/cycloisomerization reaction. In the final key step four new bonds are formed in one step. The synthetic approach allows for a high degree of diversification of the heterocyclic core structure. The optical and electrochemical properties were studied experimentally and by DFT/TD&#8208;DFT and NICS calculations. Due to the presence of the 2&#8208;azapyrene subunit, the typical electronic nature and characteristics of the 5&#8208;azatetracene moiety are lost and the compounds are electronically and optically more related to 2&#8208;azapyrenes.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Piezochromism from an o&#8208;Carborane Dyad: Boron Clusters Facilitating a Wide&#8208;Range Redshift and High Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 17, March 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spherical boron cluster. An o&#8208;carborane dyad (MTCb) with a D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A architecture was developed as a high&#8208;sensitivity piezochromic material. Compared to the carborane&#8208;free MTY, the o&#8208;carborane dyad MTCb showed a larger emission wavelength difference of 131&#8197;nm and a higher sensitivity of 32.8&#8197;nm&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GPa&#8722;1, resulting from the presence of icosahedral boron clusters.







Abstract
Piezochromic materials, which exhibit a fluorescence response with large emission spectral shifts and high sensitivity, may be useful in important applications, but there have been few reports of such organic luminophores. Herein, we report a new high&#8208;sensitivity piezochromic material based on the incorporation of an o&#8208;carborane unit, which exhibits aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties. In a high&#8208;pressure experiment, compared to carborane&#8208;free MTY, which exhibits an emission spectral shift of 75&#8197;nm and a sensitivity of 19.1&#8197;nm&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GPa&#8722;1, the o&#8208;carborane dyad MTCb shows a larger emission wavelength difference of 131&#8197;nm and a higher sensitivity of 32.8&#8197;nm&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GPa&#8722;1, demonstrating a performance that ranks among the best of organic piezochromic materials reported thus far. MTCb molecules adopt a J&#8208;aggregated pattern and have relatively loose molecular packing in the crystalline state. Interestingly, nonconjugated spherical carborane can disrupt the &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions between adjacent molecules during compression, which results in excellent piezochromic performance.

In a high-pressure experiment, compared to carborane-free &lt;b&gt;MTY&lt;/b&gt;, which exhibits an emission spectral shift of 75&#8197;nm and a sensitivity of 19.1&#8197;nm&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GPa&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-carborane dyad &lt;b&gt;MTCb&lt;/b&gt; shows a larger emission wavelength difference of 131&#8197;nm and a higher sensitivity of 32.8&#8197;nm&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GPa&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, demonstrating a performance that ranks among the best of organic piezochromic materials reported thus far. &lt;b&gt;MTCb&lt;/b&gt; molecules adopt a J-aggregated pattern and have relatively loose molecular packing in the crystalline state. Interestingly, nonconjugated spherical carborane can disrupt the &#960;-&#960; interactions between adjacent molecules during compression, which results in excellent piezochromic performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>PtSnBi Nanoplates Enable Photoacoustic Imaging&#8208;Guided Highly Efficient Photothermal Tumor Ablation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 17, March 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional intermetallic PtSnBi nanoplates were constructed as a novel photothermal agent with a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 61&#8201;% upon 808&#8208;nm laser irradiation. The application of PtSnBi nanoplates for photothermal cancer therapy both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo was successfully carried out, suggesting that PtSnBi nanoplates have great promise in cancer theranostics.







Abstract
The development of photothermal agents (PTAs) with robust photostability and high photothermal conversion efficiency is of great importance for cancer photothermal therapy. Herein, a novel PTA was created using two&#8208;dimensional intermetallic PtSnBi nanoplates (NPs), which demonstrated excellent photostability and biocompatibility with a high photothermal conversion efficiency of &#8764;61&#8201;% after PEGylation. More importantly, PtSnBi NPs could be employed as photoacoustic imaging contrast agents for tumor visualization due to their strong absorbance in the NIR range. In addition, both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo experiments confirmed that PtSnBi NPs had a good photothermal efficacy under NIR laser irradiation. Therefore, the remarkable therapeutic characteristics of PtSnBi NPs make them a most promising candidate for cancer theranostics.

         <title>Cover Feature: In Situ X&#8208;ray Diffraction Studies on the Reduction of V2O5 and WO3 by Using Hydrogen (Chem. Eur. J. 17/2023)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 17, March 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reduction of V2O5 and WO3 with hydrogen, the latter of which is performed industrially in rotary kilns under a hydrogen countercurrent, has been investigated by using in&#8197;situ X&#8208;ray powder diffraction. This method yields insights into the processes illustrated by the transparent section of the furnace, thus gaining information about the reaction pathways as well as compositions and structures of intermediates. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Kohlmann and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203932).

Travelling without moving. A Ferrier rearrangement on commercial glycals brings the double bond from position 1,2 to 2,3. Subsequent Aza&#8208;Wacker reaction allows both a 3,4&#8208;cis amination at position 3 and movement of the double bond restoring the glycal. These motions, reminiscent of a swing, enable the synthesis of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycals. Epoxidation/Glycosylation of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxygalactal derivative provide a disaccharide with high yield, defining &#8220;FAWEG&#8221; as a new sequence to access 1,2&#8208;trans 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycosides.

A schematic diagram reflects the strong electron affinity of the fluorinated dihydropentalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione (FPD) structure, in which the electron&#8208;rich nitrogen&#8208;containing amino group in the diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) skeleton is replaced by a very strongly electronegative CF2 unit. Moreover, the FPD molecule, which exhibits stronger accepting characteristics, has stronger affinity against electrons than the DPP molecule. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Yokoyama and Y. Ie (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203873).

         <title>Oxychalcogenides: A Promising Class of Materials for Nonlinear Optical Crystals with Mixed&#8208;Anion Groups</title>

The best of all worlds: Oxychalcogenides, promising IR NLO materials candidates, can integrate the property superiority of different anion groups, for example, the strong SHG response and wide IR transmission of metal chalcogenides and the large band gap and high laser damage threshold of oxides.







Abstract
Infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) materials are of great significance in the development of IR laser technology. But rationally designing high&#8208;performance IR NLO materials remains a huge challenge due to the conflict between the necessary properties required for NLO materials. Notably, oxychalcogenides with mixed&#8208;anion groups have drawn extensive interest as a family of important IR NLO candidates because they integrate the property advantages of oxides and chalcogenides by chemical substitution engineering. In this review, we provide a survey of reported oxychalcogenides and aim to present the development of NLO oxychalcogenides from the perspective of rational design of their structural chemistry. Furthermore, we focus on the relationships between partial substitution and structural symmetry as well as optical properties. These provide some helpful guidance for the further exploration and design of novel oxychalcogenide materials with excellent NLO performance in the future.

         <dc:description>
Covalent Triazine Frameworks have received great attention as an attractive photocatalyst owing to their unique structure characteristics. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the CTFs&#8217; synthetic methods, crystallization, and applications for photocatalytic water splitting. The perspectives and challenges of fabricating high crystalline CTFs and designing CTFs with excellent photocatalytic performance are also discussed.







Abstract
Covalent Triazine Frameworks (CTFs) have received great attention from academia owing to their unique structure characteristics such as nitrogen&#8208;rich structure, chemical stability, fully conjugated skeleton and high surface area; all these unique properties make CTFs attractive for widespread applications, especially for photocatalytic applications. In this review, we aim to provide recent advances in the CTFs preparation, and mainly focus on their photocatalytic applications. This review provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of the CTFs&#8217; synthetic methods, crystallinity lifting strategies, and their applications for photocatalytic water splitting. Firstly, a brief background including the photocatalytic water splitting and crystallinity are provided. Then, synthetic methods related to CTFs and the strategies for enhancing the crystallinity are summarized and compared. After that, the general photocatalytic mechanism and the strategies to improve the photocatalytic performance of CTFs are discussed. Finally, the perspectives and challenges of fabricating high crystalline CTFs and designing CTFs with excellent photocatalytic performance are discussed, inspiring the development of CTF materials in photocatalytic applications.

         <title>X&#8208;Ray Study of Cembranoids with Flexible Rings from&#160;Boswellia papyrifera&#160;Resins Allowing Structural Revisions of Misleading Structures in the Past 70 Years</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>30 new highly oxygenated and stereogenic 14&#8208;membered macrocyclic diterpenoids, papyrifuranols A&#8722;Z (1&#8722;26) and AA&#8722;AD (27&#8722;30), and 8 known analogs were isolated from Boswellia papyrifera resins. All the structures were characterized by detailed spectral analyses, quantum calculations, X&#8208;ray diffraction, and modified Mosher&#8217;s methods. Notably, six previously reported structures were revised. Our study points out misleading factors of macrocyclic cembranoids (CBs) representation in the past 7 decades by analysis of 25 X&#8208;ray structures, lending a hand for innately challengeable structure identification of such flexible macrocyclic CBs and avoiding following the tracks of an overturned cart during future structure characterization and total synthesis. Biosynthetic conversions of all the isolates were proposed and wound healing bioassays reveal that papyrifuranols N&#8722;P could significantly stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to Benzo&#8208; and Naphtho&#8208;Azaphospholes via C&#8211;H Bond Activation of Aryl&#8208;Substituted Isonitriles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Differently substituted phenyl isonitriles (with C&#8211;H bonds in ortho&#8208;position) and naphthyl isonitriles were reacted with the cyclic biradical [&#8226;P(&#181;&#8208;N&#8208;Ter)2P&#8226;] (1). Insertion of the isonitrile formed a cyclic five&#8208;membered biradical [&#8226;P(NTer)2C(R)P&#8226;] (2R, R = phenyl, napthyl) in the first step, followed by C&#8211;H activation at the aryl substituent, resulting in novel azaphospholes (5R), which could be isolated and fully characterized. The formation of the azaphospholes can be prevented by the addition of a second equivalent of isonitrile, which causes the blocking of the radical centers in 2R by adduct formation (3R). Quantum mechanical calculations showed that a significant increase in the aromaticity of the benzo&#8208; and naphtho&#8208;azaphospholes is one of the driving forces for the activation process leading to the formation of thermodynamically favored azaphospholes. Targeted activation of C&#8211;H bonds using biradical systems represents a new synthetic approach to generate benzo&#8208; and naphtho&#8208;azaphospholes.</dc:description>

Insertion of the isonitrile formed a cyclic five-membered biradical [&#8226;P(NTer)2C(R)P&#8226;] (2R, R = phenyl, napthyl) in the first step, followed by C&#8211;H activation at the aryl substituent, resulting in novel azaphospholes (5R), which could be isolated and fully characterized. The formation of the azaphospholes can be prevented by the addition of a second equivalent of isonitrile, which causes the blocking of the radical centers in 2R by adduct formation (3R). Quantum mechanical calculations showed that a significant increase in the aromaticity of the benzo- and naphtho-azaphospholes is one of the driving forces for the activation process leading to the formation of thermodynamically favored azaphospholes. Targeted activation of C&#8211;H bonds using biradical systems represents a new synthetic approach to generate benzo- and naphtho-azaphospholes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Paramagnetic Relaxation Agents for Enhancing Temporal Resolution and Sensitivity in Multinuclear FlowNMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sensitivity in FlowNMR spectroscopy for reaction monitoring often suffers from low levels of pre&#8208;magnetisation due to limited residence time of the sample in the magnetic field. While this in&#8208;flow effect is tolerable for high sensitivity nuclei such as 1H and 19F, it significantly reduces the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio in 31P and 13C spectra, making FlowNMR impractical especially at low analyte concentrations. Paramagnetic relaxation agents (PRAs), which enhance polarisation and spin&#8208;lattice relaxation, could eliminate the adverse in&#8208;flow effect and improve the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. Here, we investigate [Co(acac)3], [Mn(acac)3], [Fe(acac)3], [Cr(acac)3], [Ni(acac)2]3, [Gd(tmhd)3] and [Cr(tmhd)3] for their effectiveness in improving signal intensity per unit time in FlowNMR applications under the additional constraint of chemical inertness towards catalytically active transition metal complexes. High&#8208;spin Cr(III)acetylacetonates emerged as the most effective compounds successfully reducing 31P T1 values four&#8208; to five&#8208;fold at concentrations as low as 10 mM without causing adverse line broadening. Whereas [Cr(acac)3] showed signs of chemical reactivity with a mixture of triphenylphosphine, triphenylphosphine oxide and triphenylphosphate over the course of several hours at 80&#176; C, the bulkier [Cr(tmhd)3] was stable and equally effective as a PRA under these conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Better Peptides via Chemical Glycosylation: Somatostatin Analogues Having a Human Complex&#8208;Type N&#8208;Glycan with Improved Drug Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Somatostatin (somatotropin release&#8208;inhibiting factor, SRIF) is a growth hormone inhibitory factor in the form of a 14&#8208; or 28&#8208;amino acid peptide. SRIF affects several physiological functions through its action on five distinct SRIF receptor subtypes (sst1&#8208;5). Native SRIF has only limited clinical applications due to its rapid degradation in plasma. To overcome this obstacle, we have developed glycosylated SRIF analogues that possess not only metabolic stability but also high affinity to all five receptor subtypes by attaching human complex&#8208;type oligosaccharides. Such glycosylated SRIF analogues with improved pharmacokinetic profiles could be potent and novel therapeutic drugs for SRIF&#8208;related diseases in which several SRIF receptor subtypes are closely involved, and also shed light on new indications. Our results show that chemical glycosylation can be a powerful tool for the development of peptide and protein analogues superior to the original molecules with enhanced drug properties.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Trisubstituted 1,3,5&#8208;tri(benzimidazolyl)benzene derivatives were synthesized from &#671;&#8208;alanine, &#671;&#8208;valine, &#7429;&#8208;valine and glycine, and their self&#8208;assembling behavior and stimuli&#8208;response in solution and gel states were evaluated. Circular dichroism/UV&#8211;vis absorption spectroscopic and dynamic light scattering measurements revealed that the compounds formed H&#8208;aggregates via intramolecular hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions in nonpolar solvents such as CHCl3, whereas collapse of the aggregates was confirmed by MeOH addition. Quantum mechanical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations also supported aggregation in CHCl3.

         <title>Tetraphenylethene&#8208;based cis/trans isomers for targeted fluorescence sensing and biomedical applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular probes which can be modulated, functionalized and used to visualize the processes are highly desirable for understanding and manipulating biological systems. Geometric cis and trans isomers of tetraphenylethene (TPE) emerge as attractive candidates to fulfill these tasks thanks to the unique aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties, tailorable structures, and responsiveness to external stimuli. This minireview focuses on cis and trans isomers of TPE derivatives that are functionalized with molecular recognition units for fluorescence detection, bioimaging and cancer therapy. The effects of molecular geometry on fluorescence property, target binding ability and biological activity are summarized. The feasibility to in vitro and in vivo switch molecular configuration and thus bio&#8208;activity is discussed. Finally, the future development and challenges are discussed in view of TPE&#8208;based stereoisomers for targeted sensing and imaging&#8208;guided modulation of biological processes.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compared with O&#8208;aryl glycosides, C&#8208;aryl glycosides have remarkable stability in the process of enzyme and chemical hydrolysis, and have important applications in pharmaceutical chemistry and biochemistry. In recent years, the synthesis of C&#8208;aryl glycosides has attracted extensive attention of chemical researchers. Among them, the strategy of C&#8208;aryl glycosides synthesis through C&#8208;H functionalization does not require pre&#8208;functionalization of the substrate, and has high step economy and atomic economy, which is the focus of attention. Herein, this concept article systematically summarizes the synthesis of C&#8208;aryl glycosides with diverse regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity from the perspective of C&#8208;H arylation of glycosides and C&#8208;H glycosylation of arenes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A divergent reaction of indoline&#8208;derived azadienes with &#945;&#8208;bromohydroxamates for the selective synthesis of spiro&#8208;indolinepyrrolidinones and indoline&#8208;fused diazepinones was disclosed. This reaction sequence involved an initial formation of five&#8208;membered spirocyclic products followed by an intramolecular ring&#8208;opening and ring expansion to produce seven&#8208;membered diazepinones. We demonstrated that controlling the reaction time could modulate the reaction pathway for formation of different molecular frameworks for the same set of substrates.&#160;Based on the experimental results, the reaction mechanism was also discussed and proposed to explain the phenomena observed in the process.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Reaction rates of strained cycloalkynes and cycloalkenes with 1,2&#8208;quinone were quantified by stopped flow UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy and computational analysis. We found that the strained alkyne BCN&#8208;OH 3 (k2 1824 M&#8208;1s&#8208;1) reacts &gt;150 times faster than the strained alkene TCO&#8208;OH 5 (k2 11.56 M&#8208;1s&#8208;1). Also, the 8&#8208;membered strained alkyne BCN&#8208;OH 3 reacts 16 times faster than the more strained 7&#8208;membered THS 2 (k2 110.6 M&#8208;1s&#8208;1). Using the linearized Eyring equation we determined the thermodynamic activation parameters of these two strained alkynes, revealing that the SPOCQ reaction of quinone 1 with THS 2 is associated with &#916;H&#8225; of 0.80 kcal/mol, &#916;S&#8225; = &#8722;46.8 cal/K&#183;mol, and &#916;G&#8225; = 14.8 kcal/mol (at 25 &#176;C), whereas the same reaction with BCN&#8208;OH 3 is associated with, &#916;H&#8225; = 2.25 kcal/mol, &#916;S&#8225; = &#8722;36.3 cal/K&#183;mol, and &#916;G&#8225; = 13.1 kcal/mol (at 25 &#176;C). Computational analysis supported the values obtained by the stopped&#8208;flow measurements, with calculated &#916;G&#8225; of 15.6 kcal/mol (in H2O) for the SPOCQ reaction with THS 2, and with &#916;G&#8225; of 14.7 kcal/mol (in H2O) for the SPOCQ reaction with BCN&#8208;OH 3. With these empirically determined thermodynamic parameters, we set an important step towards a more fundamental understanding of this set of rapid biogenic click reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Crystallographic Characterization of Helical Hairpin Oligourea Foldamers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligomers designed to form a helix&#8208;turn&#8208;helix super&#8208;secondary structure have been prepared by covalently bridging aliphatic oligourea foldamer helices with either rigid aromatic or more flexible aliphatic spacers. The relative helix orientation in these dimers has been investigated at high resolution using X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. In several cases, racemic crystallography was used to facilitate crystallization and structure determination. All structures were solved by direct methods. Well&#8208;defined parallel helical hairpin motifs were observed in all cases when 4,4&#8217;&#8208;methylene diphenyl diisocyanate was employed as a dimerizing agent, irrespective of primary sequence and chain length.</dc:description>

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding (ChB) as a Robust Supramolecular Recognition Motif of Benzisothiazolinone Antibacterials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,2&#8208;benzisothiazol&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;one derivatives are highly active against a broad spectrum of fungi as well as Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. For this reason they are extensively used, e.g., as additives in detergents, leather products, paper coatings, and antifouling paintings. In this paper experimental findings are reported proving that the sulfur atom of benzisothiazolinones have a remarkable tendency to form short and directional chalcogen bonds on the extension of the covalent N&#8722;S bond and, to a lesser extent, of the C&#8722;S bond. Analyses of the Cambridge Structural Database confirm the interaction as a primary&#160; recognition motif of these systems. The electrophilicity of sulfur is crucial in the chemical reactions initiating the cascade of events resulting in the biopharmacological activities of benzisothiazolinones. The reported results suggest that the electrophility of sulfur may play a role also at earlier stages than the reactive ones, namely it may pin the compounds at the active site of target enzymes via chalcogen bonds that preorganize the system in the conformation required for the bonds formation/cleavage determining the biopharmacological activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Sparkling Organic Phosphorescence from Fluorinated Tetrathia[7]helicenes: Synthesis and Photophysical, Electrochemical and Computational Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structure&#8208;property correlations in the thiahelicene family are often not trivial since most of the functional groups present on the helical scaffold modify the conjugation size of the &#960;&#8208;system. Selecting fluorine containing groups to provide strong inductive effects without interacting with low&#8208;lying orbitals of the system could be the way to overcome the issue. Here we report a study on three fluorine&#8208;functionalized tetrathia[7]helicenes highlighting interesting correlations between the position of the functional groups and the conjugated skeleton properties. Helicenes Heli&#8208;F2 and Heli&#8208;CF&#8208;F2 were prepared by photoinduced isomerization&#8208;electrocyclization (the Mallory photocyclization) of the corresponding fluorinated benzodithienyl&#8208;ethenes Alk&#8208;F2 and Alk&#8208;CF&#8208;F2, which were prepared, in high yields, through stereo&#8208;conservative Stille reaction. Notably these helicenes were found to display green phosphorescence around 530&#8211;550 nm and the studies suggest an efficient spin orbit coupling mechanism in these high&#8208;energy triplet non&#8208;planar conjugated molecules. Both helicenes and their precursors were thoroughly characterized by means of optical and electrochemical measurements while DFT calculations enable to define a rationale on their structure&#8208;property correlations.</dc:description>

         <title>Waxberry&#8208;like MnS/Ni3S4 as High&#8208;efficiency Bi&#8208;functional Catalyst for Zn&#8208;air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this paper, waxberry&#8208;liked MnS/Ni3S4 composite catalyst was designed and synthesized. In this core&#8208;shell structure, MnS is located inside and Ni3S4 is wrapped on the surface of MnS to form a spherical structure. This structure makes the material show excellent stability in the electrocatalytic process. The diffusion staggered region structure formed at the two&#8208;phase interface greatly enhances the synergistic interaction between MnS and Ni3S4. At the same time, the defects and vacancies formed by the diffusion mechanism at the interface of the two phases increase the active site and improve the interfacial electron transfer kinetics. Therefore, MnS/Ni3S4 composites showed excellent catalytic performance for ORR/OER. At 10 mA cm&#8208;2, the overpotential of it is only 320 mV, and the half&#8208;wave potential can reach 0.81 V. The catalyst also exhibited extraordinary cycle stability and small voltage gap when used as cathode of Zn&#8208;air batteries. When the current density is 3 mA cm&#8208;2, the cyclic discharge can be stable for 400h and the voltage difference between the front and back does not increase more than. When the current density increases to 5 mA cm&#8208;2, the cyclic charge and discharge can be stable for more than 300 h.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Synthesis of Organic Molecular&#8208;Doped Fluorescent Guanine Crystals with Pearlescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomimetic synthesis of guanine crystals has been focused in the last years.&#160;However, multi&#8208;functional guanine crystals occluded with fluorescent molecules have not been realized in laboratory. Here, the controllable synthesis of guanine crystal microplatelets with fluorescent property and pearlescence was achieved for the first time by incorporating Nile red (NR) or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) molecule into guanine crystals. The synthesized fluorescent guanine crystals are pure &#946;&#8208;phase anhydrous guanine single crystals. Aqueous suspensions with NR&#8208; and FITC&#8208;doped guanine crystals exhibit distinct pearlescence. The fluorescence intensities of NR and FITC were greatly enhanced after being doped into guanine crystals due to the inhibition of aggregation&#8208;caused quenching. Moreover, films composed of fluorescent guanine microplatelets exhibit high diffuse reflection intensity (70%). This work provides a strategy to synthesize multifunctional materials composed of organic crystals occluded with dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Playground for Heavy Atom Tunnelling: Neutral Substitutional Defect Rearrangement from Diamondoids to Diamonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many diamond properties are defined by substitutional defects (i.e. a carbon atom replaced by another element), which may involve the formation of structural isomers that can interconvert. Herein, we analysed by computational means the structure, thermodynamics, and kinetics of substitutional nitrogen, boron, and oxygen from small diamondoids up to the diamond bulk, focusing on the possibility of heavy atom quantum tunnelling rearrangement between the isomers. The large range of threshold energies and bond lengths lead to a variety of intriguing behaviours, including cage size dependent thermally activated tunnelling of nitrogen, and quantum delocalization of boron. In addition, we predict that applying an external electric field makes it possible to control the rearrangement thermodynamics and kinetics through tunnelling, which lets us hypothesize that these systems can potentially be used as atomic memory devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic&#8208;Inorganic Phenolic/POSS Hybrids Provide Highly Ordered Mesoporous Structures Templated by High Thermal Stability of PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP Diblock Copolymer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anionic living polymerization was used to prepare a diblock copolymer of poly(styrene&#8208;b&#8208;4&#8208;vinyl pyridine) (PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP), and a phenolic resin with a double&#8208;decker silsesquioxane (DDSQ) cage structure was used to form a phenolic/DDSQ hybrid (PDDSQ&#8208;30 with 30 wt% DDSQ). Strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding could be confirmed through the hydroxyl (OH) groups of PDDSQ hybrid with the pyridine group of the P4VP block in PDDSQ&#8208;30/PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP blends based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses, where increasing PDDSQ concentrations resulted in a higher proportion of hydrogen&#8208;bonded pyridine groups. After thermal polymerization at 180 oC, the self&#8208;assembled structures of these PDDSQ/PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP blends were revealed by data from small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), where the d&#8208;spacing increased with raising PDDSQ concentration. Because relatively higher thermal stability of the PDDSQ hybrid than pure phenolic resin and PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP template, we can obtain the long ranger order of mesoporous PDDSQ hybrids after removing the PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP template, which reveals the high surface area and high pore volume with cylindrical and spherical structures corresponding to the PDDSQ compositions that are rarely observed by using pure phenolic resin as the matrix and could be used in supercapacitor application.</dc:description>

         <title>Formate additive for efficient and stable methylammonium&#8208;free perovskite solar cells by gas&#8208;quenching</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In order to promote the commercialization of perovskite solar cells, gas&#8208;quenching is considered to be a promising technique for perovskite film fabrication. However, when handling with methylammonium&#8208;free (MA&#8208;free) perovskites, it is often difficult to obtain high&#8208;quality perovskite films by gas&#8208;quenching. Herein, formate additives are employed to regulate the crystallization of MA&#8208;free perovskite, and improve the quality of perovskite films. Different additives of formamidine formate (FAFO) and potassium formate (KFO) is compared to investigate the role of formate groups in the crystallization of perovskite films prepared by gas&#8208;quenching. The FAFO additive facilitates the perovskite crystallization in (001) orientation whereas KFO favors for (111) orientation. The MA&#8208;free device with addition of FAFO demonstrate a champion power conversion efficiency of 20.94%, compared to that of 20.14% for KFO devices. In addition, FAFO device also exhibits improved thermal stability in ambient condition without encapsulation, extending the T80 lifetime by 18 times compared to the pristine device.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and synthetic insights on oxidative homocouplings of alkynes mediated by alkali&#8208;metal manganates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploiting bimetallic cooperation alkali&#8208;metal manganate(II) complexes can efficiently promote oxidative homocoupling of terminal alkynes furnishing an array of conjugated 1,3&#8208;diynes. The influence of the alkali&#8208;metal on these C&#8208;C bond forming processes has been studied by preparing and structurally characterizing the alkali metal tetra(alkyl) manganates [(TMEDA)2Na2Mn(CH2SiMe3)4] and [(PMDETA)2K2Mn(CH2SiMe3)4]. Reactivity studies using phenylacetylene as a model substrate have revealed that for the homocoupling to take place initial metalation of the alkyne is required. In this regard, the lack of basicity of neutral Mn(CH2SiMe3)2 precludes the formation of the diyne. Contrastingly, the tetra(alkyl) alkali&#8208;metal manganates behave as polybasic reagents, being able to easily deprotonate phenylacetylene yielding [{(THF)4Na2Mn(C&#8801;CPh)4}&#8734;] and [(THF)4Li2Mn(C&#8801;CPh)4]. Controlled exposure of [{(THF)4Na2Mn(C&#8801;CPh)4}&#8734;] and [(THF)4Li2Mn(C&#8801;CPh)4] to dry air confirmed their intermediary in formation of 1,4&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiyne in excellent yields. While the Na/Mn(II) partnership proved to be the most efficient in stoichiometric transformations, under catalytic regimes, the combination of MC&#8801;CAr (M= Li, Na) and MnCl2 (6 mol%) only works for lithium, most likely due to the degradation of alkynylsodiums under the aerobic reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>&#955;3&#8208; and &#955;5&#8208;Iodanes: Substituent Effects and Pseudorotation/ Hypervalent Twisting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypervalent iodine (III and V) compounds exhibit positional isomerization through pseudorotation or twisting; the latter have been invoked for the stability as well as the reactivities of &#955;3&#8208; and &#955;5&#8208;iodanes. By judicious exploitation of sterics, the twisting process in iodanes can be facilitated to promote reactivity. For example, ortho&#8208;substitution in &#955;3&#8208; and &#955;5&#8208;iodanes accelerates &#945;&#8208;tosyloxylation of ketones and oxidation of alcohols. The enhancement of reactivity arises from sterically&#8208;induced non&#8208;planarity and the resultant weakening of the 3c&#8208;4e bonds involving the hypervalent iodine atom. The ortho&#8208;substitution constitutes an important strategy to maneuver reactivity, control selectivity, and develop new catalysts, including chiral, for diverse reactions. This review entails coverage of the literature developments in regard to the effect of substituents and twisting/pseudorotation on the stability as well as the reactivity of hypervalent &#955;3&#8208; and &#955;5&#8208;iodanes, and the application of the latter for synthetic transformations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings&#160;(SMRs) are utilized as the most practical method to construct C&#8208;C bond, especial for biaryls. However, a major disadvantage of current protocols is the requirement of excess organoboron coupling partner (1.5&#8208;3.0 eq.). Herein, a novel palladacyclic 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)acenaphthoimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (AnIPr) precatalyst possessing a chiral oxazoline was designed, which enabled a general protocol towards bulky tri&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted biaryls, ternaphthalenes and diarylanthracenes via the Pd&#8208;catalyzed SMR&#160;employing equimolar organoborons and aryl bromides. A remarkable scope of substrates with various functional groups and heterocycles were well compatible with an adaptability to synthesize useful ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling Photodegradation and Photosensitization Mechanisms of Unconjugated Pterins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unconjugated pterins are ubiquitous molecules participating in countless enzymatic processes and potentially involved in the photosensitization of singlet oxygen, amino acids, and nucleotides. Following electronic excitation with UV&#8208;A light, some of these pterins degrade, producing hydrogen peroxide as the main side product. This process, that is known to take place in vivo, contributes to oxidative stress and melanocyte destruction in vitiligo. In this work, we present for the first time mechanistic insight to the formation of transient triplet species which simultaneously trigger Type I and Type II photosensitizing processes and the initiation of degradation processes. Our calculations reveal that photodegradation of 6&#8208;biopterin, which accumulates in the skin of vitiligo patients, leads to 6&#8208;formylpterin via retro&#8208;aldol reaction, and subsequently to 6&#8208;carboxypterin through a water&#8208;mediated aldehyde oxidation. Additionally, we show that the changes in the photosensitizing potential of these systems with pH come from the modulation of their excited&#8208;state redox potentials.</dc:description>

         <title>Phase&#8208;Dependent Long Persistent Phosphorescence in Coumarin&#8208;Phosphine&#8208;Based Coinage Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A coumarin functionalized aminodiphosphine has been introduced as a bidentate ligand in coinage metal chemistry. Mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trimetallic copper and silver complexes were synthesized by using this ligand. A hybrid character of the ligand led to compounds with rich luminescence properties. These include coumarin&#8208;based blue fluorescence, observed as a sole emission in solution at room temperature, and green phosphorescence which is efficient at low temperatures and dominates the spectra of the metal complexes. In the rigid environment of frozen solutions, the green phosphorescence shows an unusually long (for metal complexes) decay on the time scale over seconds in high quantum yields. In addition, a red phosphorescence, which may be assigned to the triplet state localized in the phosphine&#8208;M3Cl2 (M = Cu, Ag), is observed for the trinuclear complexes at low temperature. Neither the second&#8208;long phosphorescence nor the red emission, are observed for coumarin ligand and thus, are a result of the coordination to coinage metal clusters. The excited states in these compounds were also investigated by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Caffeine biodegradation by cytochrome P450 1A2. What determines the product distributions?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Caffeine is a natural compound found in plant seeds that after consumption by humans effects the central nervous system as well as the cardiovascular system. In general, the cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver are involved in the biodegradation of caffeine, which gives paraxanthine, theobromine and theophylline products. There has been debate for many years why multiple products are obtained and how their distributions are determined. To this end we performed a high&#8208;level computational study using a combination of molecular dynamics and quantum mechanical approaches. A series of quantum chemical cluster models on the mechanism of caffeine activation by P450 model complexes give hydrogen atom abstraction barriers that predicts the correct ordering and statistical distribution of products. Our studies highlight that second&#8208;coordination sphere effects and thermochemical properties of the substrate determine the product distributions.</dc:description>

         <title>Intermetallic Compound TiM (M = Co, Fe) with a Layered Structure Prepared by Deoxidizing Ilmenite&#8208;type Oxides in Molten LiCl&#8211;CaH2 Mixtures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CsCl&#8208;type intermetallic compounds TiM (M = Co, Fe) were obtained by deoxidizing trigonal ilmenite&#8208;type MTiO3 with a reducing agent CaH2 in molten LiCl at 600&#176;C. X&#8208;ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy with energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses revealed the formation of nanoscale layered structures, which enhanced specific surface areas (~20 m2/g) in the intermetallic compounds. In the initial deoxidation stage, Li2TiO3&#8208;like compounds were observed as an intermediate, suggesting the substitution of M in MTiO3 by Li from the molten LiCl. MTiO3 has a layered structure perpendicular to the c&#8208;axis of the trigonal structure, suggesting that the layered structures may originate from the crystal structure of the precursors. Formation of the Li2TiO3&#8208;like intermediate may help maintain the original layered structure during deoxidation and the subsequent alloying at temperatures as low as 600&#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxynitrogenation of Carboxylic Acids with Cyanamides to Access Nitriles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient strategies to access nitriles from common organic functionalities are highly important, given their significance in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Although the direct transformation of carboxylic acids to nitriles have been explored for decades, there is few general and practical protocol to access nitriles from carboxylic acid precursors. Herein, we describe an iron&#8208;catalyzed deoxynitrogenaton strategy to convert carboxylic acids into nitriles. This method utilizes a cyanamide as the recyclable nitrogen donor and deoxygenating reagent, operates broadly across aryl, alkenyl, and alkyl carboxylic acids, and features an easy setup without inert gas protection. The synthetic value of this method is demonstrated by application in late&#8208;stage modification of drug molecules, synthesis of a pharmaceutical structure, and scaleup reactions and downstream derivatizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative Electromerism of a Well&#8208;defined Mononuclear Copper Complex Through Reversible Intramolecular Metal&#8208;Ligand Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper amine oxidases are enzymes that exhibit in their active site a mononuclear copper complex and a 2,4,5&#8208;trihydroxyphenylalanine quinone (TPQ) cofactor; in the oxidative half of the catalytic cycle, the enzymes regulate their activity by a temperature&#8208;dependent electron transfer equilibrium between the CuII complex with the reduced, aminoquinol form of the cofactor and the reactive CuI complex with the corresponding oxidized, semiquinone form of the cofactor. Here, we report the first mononuclear copper complex with redox&#8208;active ligands showing quantitative, reversible electromerism between a CuII eletromer with reduced, neutral ligand and a CuI electromer with an oxidized, radical monocationic ligand. The CuII form, being exclusively present at low temperature, exhibits a lower enthalpy (like the enzymes), but the CuI complex exhibits a higher entropy and is exclusively present at room temperature in CH2Cl2 solution. Further analysis, based on six different copper complexes, discloses a large solvent effect on electromerism.</dc:description>

         <title>Silver&#8208;based Terpyridine Complexes as Antitumor Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silver complexes bearing substituted terpyridine or tetra&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinylpyrazine ligands have been prepared and structurally characterised. The study of the anticancer properties of silver complexes with this type of ligands is scarce, despite the possibilities of combining the properties of the metal and the ability of the ligands for DNA binding. Here, the antiproliferative activity, stability, CT&#8208;DNA binding and mechanism of cell death of these types of derivatives are studied. High cytotoxicity against different tumour cells was observed, and, more important, a great selectivity index has been detected between tumour cells and healthy Lymphocytes T for some of these compounds. The CT&#8208;DNA interaction study has shown that these derivatives are be able to interact with CT&#8208;DNA via moderate intercalation. Furthermore, cell death studies indicate that these derivatives promote the apoptosis via mitochondrial pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic liquid&#8208;mediated approach for the synthesis of site&#8208;specific thioether conjugates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;specific conjugation approaches are of great importance in drug discovery, notably for the synthesis of biochemical probes or molecular conjugates for targeted delivery. Herein, we report a mild ionic liquid (IL)&#8208;mediated thiolation technique that relies on the use of 1,3&#8208;ethyl&#8208;methyl imidazolium acetate, [C2mim][OAc] as a solvent and precursor to generate activated IL, as well as a solvent for the conjugation reaction. First, a focused library of active ILs was prepared for functionalizing/conjugating cysteine&#8208;containing small molecules and unprotected peptides. Interestingly, a bifunctional active IL could also be successfully employed as a linker for the conjugation of peptides lacking Cys. This study sets the ground for further investigation of the use of active ILs for modifying, labeling or conjugating larger and more complex therapeutic modalities such as proteins and antibodies.</dc:description>

Reacting 1 with group 14 nucleophiles revealed different organo&#8208;substituted P5R middle&#8208;decks depending on the steric and electronic effects of the used alkali metal organyls (2: R = tBu; 3: R = Me). With group 15 nucleophiles, first isolatable monosubstituted complexes with phosphanides could be obtained as P5 ligands containing exocyclic {PR2} units (4: R = Cy, H; 5: R = Ph). These monoanionic complexes 2&#8208;5 were isolated and electrophilic quenching revealed novel types of neutral functionalized polyphosphorus complexes. These complexes bear formal chains of P5R&#8217;R&#8217;&#8217; (6: R&#8217; = tBu, R&#8217; = Me) in a 1,3&#8208;disubstitution pattern or P6R&#8217;R&#8217;&#8217;R&#8217;&#8217;&#8217; units (7: R&#8217; = Cy, R&#8217;&#8217; = H, R&#8217;&#8217;&#8217; = Me; 8: R&#8217; = Me, R&#8217;&#8217; = Ph, R&#8217;&#8217;&#8217; = Me) in a 1,1,3&#8208;substitution as middle&#8208;decks stabilized by one {Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co} and one {Cp*Fe} fragment. One&#8208;electron oxidation of 2, 3 or 5 by AgBF4 gave access to paramagnetic triple&#8208;decker complexes bearing P5R middle&#8208;decks in various coordination fashions (R = tBu (10), R = PPh2 (12)). For R = Me (11) a dimerization is observed revealing a diamagnetic tetranuclear cluster containing a unique dihydrofulvalene&#8208;type P10R2 ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Inverting the Electronic Structure of Diylidylgermylenes by Backbone Modification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to the strong electron&#8208;donating ability of ylide substituents, diylidyltetrylenes are usually highly nucleophilic species with strong donor capacities. Here, we demonstrate that their electronic properties are in fact highly flexible and can be effectively tuned through variation of the substituent in the ylide backbone. Initial density functional theory studies showed that cyano groups are particularly capable in lowering the LUMO energy of diylidyl germylenes thus turning these usually highly nucleophilic species into electrophilic compounds. This was confirmed by experimental studies. Attempts to synthesize the germylene (YCN)2Ge [with YCN = Ph3P&#8208;(C)&#8208;CN] from the corresponding metalated ylides YCNK selectively led to germanide [(YCN)3Ge)K]2 thus reflecting the electrophilic nature of the intermediate formed germylene. XRD analysis of single crystals of (YCN)2Ge &#8208; serendipitously obtained through protonative cleavage of one ylide from the germanide &#8208; revealed a monomeric structure with rather long Ge&#8208;ylide linkages, which corroborates well with a pure single bond and no stabilization of the empty p&#960; orbital at germanium through pi bonding. The germanide exhibits methanide&#8208;like reactivity towards chalcogens but a likewise weak Ge&#8208;C bond as demonstrated by the insertion of carbon dioxide.</dc:description>
