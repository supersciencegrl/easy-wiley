      <title>Pressure Sensitivity of SynGAP/PSD&#8208;95 Condensates as a Model for Postsynaptic Densities and Its Biophysical and Neurological Ramifications</title>
      <dc:description>
A binary protein condensate that mimics postsynaptic densities revealed high pressure sensitivity. This may help to gain a better understanding of the biophysical causes of pressure&#8208;related neurological disorders, such as the high&#8208;pressure neurological syndrome experienced by deep&#8208;sea divers.

      <title>An Expansion of Crystalline Sponge X&#8208;ray Analysis to Elucidate the Molecular Structure of Reactive Compounds via Ion Pair Formation</title>
      <dc:description>The crystalline sponge (CS) method allows structural elucidation of a target compound (guest) in solution by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction through trapping the guest into the CS framework. In principle, the CS method is inapplicable to reactive compounds that break the CS framework, such as acidic, basic, or nucleophilic ones. Here, a solution to this problem is disclosed wherein an ion pair of the guest compound is formed during the guest&#8208;soaking step by adding a suitable reagent. The ion pair can be observed and doesn&#8217;t damage the CS framework. Using the developed method, amino, guanidino, and amidino compounds have been successfully analyzed as ion pairs with sulfonic acids. Practical utility has been shown because the absolute configurations of optically resolved amine derivatives were revealed with only a few micrograms. This demonstrates that the ion&#8208;pair&#8208;soaking method is simple and expands the range of compounds applicable to the CS method.</dc:description>

The effect of acids on the CO  2  reduction was investigated using the Zn porphyrin&#8208;Re dyad and BIH. Acetic acid, a relatively strong Br&#248;nsted acid, rapidly causes the porphyrin&#8217;s color to fade upon irradiation and dramatically decreases CO production, whereas proper weak Br&#248;nsted acids such as 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol and phenol enhance the CO  2  reduction.</dc:description>

      <title>An Evolutionary Strategy for Identification of Higher Order, Green Fluorescent Host&#8208;Guest Pairs Compatible with Living Systems</title>
      <dc:description>Engineered miniprotein host&#8208;small molecule guest pairs could be utilized to design new processes within cells as well as investigate fundamental aspects of cell signaling mechanisms. However, the development of host&#8208;guest pairs capable of functioning in living systems has proven challenging. Moreover, few examples of host&#8208;guest pairs with stoichiometries other than 2:1 exist, significantly hindering the ability to study the influence of oligomerization state on signaling fidelity. Herein, we present an approach to identify host&#8208;guest systems for relatively small green fluorescent guests by incorporation into cyclic peptides. The optimal host&#8208;guest pair produced a 10&#8208;fold increase in green fluorescence signal upon binding. Biophysical characterization clearly demonstrated higher order supramolecular assembly, which could be visualized on the surface of living yeast cells using a turn&#8208;on fluorescence readout. This work further defines evolutionary design principles to afford host&#8208;guest pairs with stoichiometries other than 2:1 and enables the identification of spectrally orthogonal host&#8208;guest pairs.</dc:description>

      <title>Quantifying the overall efficiency of circularly polarized emitters</title>
      <dc:description>An increasing number of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) molecular emitters has been developed in the recent years and many of them are intended for applications in which high overall CPL efficiencies are requested. In order to have a complete picture of the efficiency of a CPL emitter, the dissymmetry factor (  g  lum  ) is not enough. In the following we propose a new quantity, named CPL brightness (B  CPL  ), which takes into account absorption extinction coefficient and quantum yield along with the  g  lum  factor. We calculated B  CPL  value for more than 180 compounds reported in the literature and we analyse data distribution for the main classes of CPL molecular emitters. Such tool can be employed to put into context new CPL active compounds and to direct the choice of molecular systems for specific CPL applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Caught in the Loop: Binding of the [Ru(phen)2(dppz)]2+ Light&#8208;Switch Compound to Quadruplex DNA in Solution informed by Time&#8208;Resolved Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>Ultrafast time resolved infrared (TRIR) is used to report on the binding site of the [Ru(phen)  2  (dppz)]  2+  &#8216;light&#8208;switch&#8217; complex with both bimolecular (Oxytricha nova telomere) and intramolecular (human telomere) guanine&#8208;quadruplex structures in both K  +  and Na  +  containing solutions. TRIR permits the simultaneous monitoring both of the &#8216;dark&#8217; and &#8216;bright&#8217; states of the complex and of the quadruplex nucleobase bases, the latter via a Stark Effect induced by the excited state of the complex. These data are used to establish the contribution of guanine base stacking and loop interactions to the binding site of this biologically relevant DNA structure in solution. A particularly striking observation is the strong thymine signal observed for the Na  +  form of the human telomere sequence, which is expected to be in the anti&#8208;parallel conformation.</dc:description>

      <title>Metal&#8208;Only Lewis Pairs of Rhodium with s, p and d&#8208;Block Metals</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;only Lewis pairs (MOLPs) in which the two metal fragments are solely connected by a dative M&#8594;M bond represent privileged architectures to acquire fundamental understanding of bimetallic bonding. This has important implications in many catalytic processes or supramolecular systems that rely on synergistic effects between two metals. However, a systematic experimental/computational approach on a well&#8208;defined class of compounds is lacking. Here we report a family of MOLPs constructed around the Rh(I) precursor [(  &#951;  5  &#8208;C  5  Me  5  )Rh(PMe  3  )  2  ] (  1  ) with a series of  s  ,  p  and  d  &#8208;block metals, mostly from the main group elements, and investigate their bonding by computational means. Among the new MOLPs, we have structurally characterized those formed by dative bonding between  1  and MgMeBr, AlMe  3  , GeCl  2  , SnCl  2  , ZnMe  2  and Zn(C  6  F  5  )  2,  as well as spectroscopically identified the ones resulting from coordination to MBAr  F  (M = Na, Li; BAr  F  &#8208;  = [B(C  6  H  2  &#8208;3,5&#8208;(CF  3  )  2  )  4  ]  &#8208;  ) and CuCl. Multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, including  103  Rh NMR, is used to probe the formation of Rh&#8594;M bonds. A comprehensive theoretical analysis of those provides clear trends. As anticipated, greater bond covalency is found for the more electronegative acids, while ionic character dominates for the least electronegative nuclei, though some degree of electron sharing is identified in all cases.</dc:description>

      <title>Impact of molecular&#160;size and shape&#160;on the supramolecular co&#8208;assembly of chiral tricarboxamides.&#160;A comparative study</title>
      <dc:description>We report herein a comparative investigation of the chiral amplification features of a series of three families of&#160;  C  3  &#8208;symmetric tricarboxamides: 1,3,5&#8208;triphenylbenzenetricarboxamides (TPBAs), benzenetricarboxamides (BTAs) and oligo(phenylene ethynylene) tricarboxamides (OPE&#8208;TAs). As previously observed for BTAs and OPE&#8208;TAs, a similar dichroic response is obtained for TPBAs decorated with three, two or only one chiral side chain bearing stereogenic centers, thus confirming the efficient transfer of point chirality to the supramolecular helical aggregates. Unlike BTAs and OPE&#8208;TAs, the chiral amplification ability of TPBAs&#160; in majority rules experiments &#160;shows a negligible dependence on the number of chiral centers per monomeric unit, and stands the largest among the series of tricarboxamides. Detailed experimental and theoretical studies demonstrate that the rotation angle between the TPBA units in the helical stack is intermediate to that observed for BTAs and OPE&#8208;TAs. This feature strongly conditions the steric interactions between vicinal molecules in the stack and the final chiral amplification outcome. Theoretical calculations furthermore show that achiral side chains favor the interdigitation of the helical aggregates and thereby the formation of bundle superstructures.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The structural deterioration of archetypical, well&#8208;faceted metal organic frameworks (MOFs) has been evaluated upon exposure to an acidic environment (H  2  S). Experimental results show that the structural damage highly depends on the nature of the hybrid network ( e.g., softness of the metal ions, hydrophilic properties, among others ) and the crystallographic orientation of the exposed facets. Microscopy images show that&#160; HKUST&#8208;1 with well&#8208;defined octahedral (111) facets is completely deteriorated, &#160;ZIF&#8208;8 with preferentially exposed (110) facets exhibits a large external deterioration with the development of holes or cavities in the mesoporous range, whereas UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  &#160;with (111) exposed facets, and PCN&#8208;250 with (100) facets does not reflect any sign of surface damage. Despite the selectivity in the external deterioration, X&#8208;ray diffraction and gas adsorption measurements confirm that indeed all MOFs suffer an important internal deterioration, these effects being more severe for MOFs based on softer cations (e.g.,&#160; Cu&#8208;based HKUST&#8208;1 and &#160;Fe&#8208;based PCN&#8208;250).

      <dc:description>The search for long&#8208;lived red and NIR fluorescent dyes is challenging and hitherto scarcely reported. Herein, the viability of aza&#8208;BODIPY skeleton as a promising system for achieving thermal activated delayed fluorescent probes (TADF) emitting in this target region is demonstrated for the first time. The synthetic versatile of this scaffold allows the design of energy and charge transfer cassettes modulating the stereoelectronic properties of the energy donors, the spacer moieties and the linkage positions. Delayed emission from these architectures is recorded in the red spectral region (695&#8208;735 nm) with lifetimes longer than 100 ms in aerated solutions at room temperature. The computational&#8208;aided photophysical study under mild and hard irradiation regimes disclose the interplay between molecular structure and photonic performance to develop long&#8208;lived fluorescence red emitters through thermally activated reverse intersystem crossing. The efficient and long&#8208;lasting NIR emission of the newly synthesized aza&#8208;BODIPY systems provides a basis to develop advanced optical materials with exciting and appealing photonic response.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>In the last 30 years, fullerene&#8208;based materials have become popular building blocks for devices with a broad range of applications. Among fullerene derivatives, endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs, M@C  x  ) have been widely studied due to their unique properties and reactivity. For real applications, fullerenes and EMFs must be exohedrally functionalized. It has been shown that encapsulated metal cations facilitate the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction in fullerenes.

Our results show that the incarcerated ion has very important effect on the kinetics and thermodynamics of this reaction.

      <title>RhIII&#8208;Catalyzed Double Dehydrogenative Coupling of Free 1&#8208;Naphthylamines with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Esters</title>
      <dc:description>
A double oxidative coupling: The RhIII&#8208;catalyzed double oxidative coupling of free 1&#8208;naphthylamines and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters were achieved, leading to the formation of a class of biologically important alkylidene&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydrobenzo[cd]indoles scaffolds.







Abstract
The RhIII&#8208;catalyzed, consecutive double C&#8722;H oxidative coupling of free 1&#8208;naphthylamine and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters through C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H and C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H bonds is reported. The one step reaction leads to the formation of biologically important alkylidene&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydrobenzo[cd]indoles scaffolds. This efficient process is much more synthetically convenient and useful than others because the starting materials, such as 1&#8208;naphthylamine derivatives are readily available and the free amine serves as a directing group.

      <title>Unveiling the occurrence of Co(III) in NiCo layered electroactive hydroxides. The role of distorted environments</title>
      <dc:description>Co&#8208; and Ni&#8208;based layered hydroxides constitute a unique class of two&#8208;dimensional inorganic materials with exceptional chemical diversity, physicochemical properties and outstanding performance as supercapacitors and overall water splitting catalysts. Recently, the occurrence of Co(III) in these phases has been proposed as a key factor that enhance their electrochemical performance. However, the origin of this centers and control over its contents remains as an open question. We employed the Epoxide Route to synthesize a whole set of &#945;&#8208;NiCo layered hydroxides. The PXRD and XAS characterization alert about the occurrence of Co(III) as a consequence of the increment in the Ni content. DFT+U simulation suggest that the shortening of the Co&#8211;O distance promotes a structural distortion in the Co environments, resulting in a double degeneration in the octahedral Co 3d orbitals. Hence, a strong modification of the electronic properties leaves the system prone to oxidation, by the appearance of Co localized electronic states on the Fermi level. This work combines a microscopic interpretation supported by a multiscale crystallochemical analysis, regarding the so called synergistic redox behavior of Co and Ni, offering fundamental tools for the controllable design of highly efficient electroactive materials. To the best of our knowledge this is the first computational&#8208;experimental investigation of the electronic and structural details of &#945;&#8208;NiCo hydroxides, laying the foundation for the fine tuning of electronic properties in layered hydroxides.</dc:description>

      <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloisomerization of Sulfur Ylides to Dihydrobenzothiepines</title>
      <dc:description>
Many reactions of sulfonium ylides suffer from stoichiometric waste production through release of the sulfur moiety. An atom&#8208;economical synthesis of heterocycles has now been developed, which showcases a novel mode of sulfonium ylide reactivity. Treatment of S&#8208;homopropargyl sulfonium ylides with a gold catalyst under mild conditions results in an atom&#8208;economical, charge&#8208;accelerated sulfonium [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement, giving access to a variety of novel dihydrobenzo[b]thiepines without release of any sulfur by&#8208;product.

More information can be found in the Communication by N. Maulide et&#8197;al. (DOI: &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.20200062210.1002/chem.202000622&lt;/a&gt;).

The polar head group and the long alkyl chains in the backbone contribute to a lipid&#8208;like behavior, while an alkyl ammonium group provides the ability for crucial electrostatic interaction for the transfection process.

      <title>A journey from thermally&#8208;tunable synthesis to spectroscopy of phenylmethanimine in gas&#8208;phase and solution</title>
      <dc:description>Phenylmethanimine is an aromatic imine with a twofold relevance in chemistry: organic synthesis and astrochemistry. To tackle both aspects, a multidisciplinary approach has been exploited and a new, easily accessible synthetic approach to generate stable imine&#8208;intermediates in the gas phase and in solution has been introduced. The combination of this formation pathway &#8208;based on the thermal decomposition of hydrobenzamide&#8208; with a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computational characterization of phenylmethanimine laid the foundation for its first laboratory observation by means of rotational electric resonance spectroscopy. Both E and Z isomers have been accurately characterized, thus providing a reliable basis to guide future astronomical observations. A further characterization has been carried out by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, showing the feasibility of this synthetic approach in solution. The temperature dependence as well as possible mechanisms of the thermolysis process have been examined.</dc:description>

Despite recent improvements, the treatment of large tumors remains a major clinical challenge due to the low ability of the photosensitizer (PS) to penetrate a 3D cellular architecture and the low oxygen concentrations present in the tumour centre. To mimic the conditions found in clinical tumors, exceptionally large 3D multicellular tumour spheroids (MCTSs) with a diameter of 800 &#181;m were used in this work to test a series of new Ru(II) polypyridine complexes as 1&#8208;Photon and 2&#8208;Photon PSs. These metal complexes were found to fully penetrate the 3D cellular architecture and to generate singlet oxygen in the hypoxic centre upon light irradiation. While having no observed dark toxicity, the lead compound of this study showed an impressive phototoxicity upon clinically relevant 1&#8208;Photon (595 nm) or 2&#8208;Photon (800 nm) excitation with a full eradication of the hypoxic centre of the MCTSs. Importantly, this efficacy was also demonstrated on mice bearing an adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial tumour.</dc:description>

      <title>Frontispiece: Precursor Design Strategies for the Low&#8208;Temperature Synthesis of Functional Oxides: It's All in the Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>
Limiting the energetic budget during the solution processing of oxides is one of the most crucial considerations, adhering to green chemistry principles. Low&#8208;temperature strategies require thought&#8208;out adjustments at the level of the chemical precursor system. Specific reagents can be added to trigger auto&#8208;combustion reactions, influence the sol&#8208;gel network, obtain UV&#8208;sensitive precursors or to tune the intermediates/transition states during decomposition. The successful implementation will also open up novel applications in flexible electronics and hybrid materials. For more details see the Review by W. Marchal et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;9070&#8197;ff.

      <title>Frontispiece: Metal Oxide Nanosheets as 2D Building Blocks for the Design of Novel Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional metal oxide nanocrystals are often made by a chemical delamination process in water, which involves a layered oxide phase as the starting material. The exfoliated nanosheets have aspect ratios comparable with that of a paper sheet, and they are also very flexible. Oxide nanosheets can be used as building blocks for the construction of improved or entirely new functional materials for a wide range of application areas: nanoelectronics, energy storage, catalysis and tribology, to name just a few.

      <dc:description>
Sustainable solution methods for flexible metal oxide semiconductors are increasingly attractive to address environmental challenges through simple, cost&#8208;effective, and printable large&#8208;area manufacturing processes. This review reports state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, flexible, solution&#8208;processed metal oxide thin&#8208;film transistor semiconductors; nanoparticles, combustion, aqueous, annealing, and novel deposition approaches to low&#8208;temperature fabrication of solution&#8208;processed metal oxide semiconductors, as well as novel structures, gate dielectrics, and electrodes. In addition, solution&#8208;processed metal oxide semiconductor&#8208;based flexible systems, including displays, sensors, memory devices, neuromorphic devices, and energy&#8208;harvesting devices (solar cells and nanogenerators) are described.

      <dc:description>
Laser synthesis of colloids emerged in recent years as a versatile approach to access a library of clean oxide nanoparticles relying on only four main strategies running at room temperature and ambient pressure: laser ablation in liquid, laser fragmentation in liquid, laser melting in liquid and laser defect&#8208;engineering in liquid. Here, established laser&#8208;based methodologies are reviewed through the presentation of a panorama of oxide nanoparticles. For more information, see the Review by V. Amendola, S.

The current state of the art of the use of cross&#8208;linked organic polymers, both insoluble (resins or gels) and soluble (micro&#8208; and nanogels), as aids for the low&#8208;temperature preparation of stable metal oxide nanoparticles or nanostructured metal oxides is reviewed herein.

This review outlines key variables in photoreactions that affect epitaxial and polycrystalline thin film growth, including precursor materials, laser wavelength, laser fluence, and carbon. In addition, the features of the photoreaction process that can be controlled at a low temperature by oxygen non&#8208;stoichiometry are examined. Likewise, functions that are neither achieved by developing a gradient structure nor controlled by a thermal equilibrium reaction are detailed. For more details, see the Review by T.

Photochemistry can play a leading role in the low&#8208;temperature processing of metal&#8208;oxide thin films, affecting the different stages of the chemical solution deposition process. These stages include everything from the synthesis of the precursor solution to the formation of the amorphous metal&#8208;oxygen network in the film and its subsequent crystallization into the oxide phase. The lowering of the processing temperature provides environmental and economic benefits, in addition to technological advantages, such as the integration of functional oxide layers into flexible electronics systems.

      <title>Hierarchical Mn3O4 Anchored on 3D Graphene Aerogels via C&#8722;O&#8722;Mn Linkage with Superior Electrochemical Performance for Flexible Asymmetric Supercapacitor</title>
      <dc:description>
Carbon nanohorns: An asymmetric supercapacitor was constructed by using graphene aerogels reacted either with Mn(AC)2 to form the anode or CNH to form the cathode (see scheme).







Abstract
Flexible asymmetric supercapacitors are more appealing in flexible electronics because of high power density, wide cell voltage, and higher energy density than symmetric supercapacitors in aqueous electrolyte. In virtues of excellent conductivity, rich porous structure and interconnected honeycomb structure, three dimensional graphene aerogels show great potential as electrode in asymmetric supercapacitors. However, graphene aerogels are rarely used in flexible asymmetric supercapacitors because of easily re&#8208;stacking of graphene sheets, resulting in low electrochemical activity. Herein, flower&#8208;like hierarchical Mn3O4 and carbon nanohorns are incorporated into three dimensional graphene aerogels to restrain the stack of graphene sheets, and are applied as the positive and negative electrode for asymmetric supercapacitors devices, respectively. Besides, a strong chemical coupling between Mn3O4 and graphene via the C&#8208;O&#8208;Mn linkage is constructed and can provide a good electron&#8208;transport pathway during cycles. Consequently, the asymmetric supercapacitor device shows high rate cycle stability (87.8&#8201;% after 5000&#8197;cycles) and achieves a high energy density of 17.4&#8197;&#956;Wh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with power density of 14.1&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (156.7&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;3) at 1.4&#8197;V.

      <title>London Dispersion and Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Interactions in Bulky Molecules: The Case of Diadamantyl Ether Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Alkyl groups matter: Complexes between diadamantyl ether (DAE) and water and alcohols with increasing side&#8208;chain size have been studied by using rotational spectroscopy. DAE and the clustering molecules interact through an O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bond and London dispersion (LD) interactions. The H&#8722;C&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C LD attractions take place between the alkyl groups of the alcohols and those of DAE. The LD interactions increase with increasing size of the alcohol.







Abstract
Diadamantyl ether (DAE, C20H30O) represents a good model to study the interplay between London dispersion and hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions. By using broadband rotational spectroscopy, an accurate experimental structure of the diadamantyl ether monomer is obtained and its aggregates with water and a variety of aliphatic alcohols of increasing size are analyzed. In the monomer, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C London dispersion attractions between the two adamantyl subunits further stabilize its structure. Water and the alcohol partners bind to diadamantyl ether through hydrogen bonding and non&#8208;covalent Owater/alcohol&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;CDAE and C&#8722;Halcohol&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;CDAE interactions. Electrostatic contributions drive the stabilization of all the complexes, whereas London dispersion interactions become more pronounced with increasing size of the alcohol. Complexes with dominant dispersion contributions are significantly higher in energy and were not observed in the experiment. The results presented herein shed light on the first steps of microsolvation and aggregation of molecular complexes with London dispersion energy donor (DED) groups and the kind of interactions that control them.

      <title>Molten&#8208;Salt Media Synthesis of N&#8208;Doped Carbon Tubes Containing Encapsulated Co Nanoparticles as a Bifunctional Air Cathode for Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Battery power: Cobalt nanoparticles encapsulated in a N&#8208;doped carbon nanotube network were synthesized by the molten salt method and developed as an ORR and OER bifunctional electrocatalyst. The assembled rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery using Co@N&#8208;CNTs as an air cathode has a power density of 168&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Cost efficient bifunctional air cathodes possessing high electrocatalytic activity are of great importance for the development of secondary Zn&#8208;air batteries. In this work, cobalt nanoparticles are encapsulated within a 3D N&#8208;doped open network of carbon tubes (Co@N&#8208;CNTs) by a molten&#8208;salt synthesis procedure conducted at a high temperature. Physical characterization demonstrates that Co@N&#8208;CNTs are comprised of Co particle inserted carbon tubes with mesoporous tube walls, providing significant active surface area for electrochemical reactions. High electrocatalytic activity of Co@N&#8208;CNTs towards both oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions is due to its well&#8208;developed active surface and a synergistic effect between N&#8208;doped carbon and Co nanoparticles. Both primary and secondary Zn&#8208;air battery cells assembled using Co@N&#8208;CNTs as an air cathode show higher electrochemical performance than similar cells containing commercial Pt/C and Pt/C +RuO2, making the newly developed material a promising alternative to existing metal&#8208;based air cathodes.

      <title>Dodecahedral Au/Pt Nanobowls as Robust Plasmonic Electrocatalysts for Methanol Oxidation under Visible&#8208;Light Illumination</title>
      <dc:description>
Plasmonic nanocatalysts: Au/Pt nanobowls were fabricated by a facile and template&#8208;free method and used as plasmonic electrocatalysts for methanol oxidation. The electrocatalytic activity and stability were highly improved under visible&#8208;light illumination owing to the photothermal and hot&#8208;carrier effect, which were confirmed experimentally.







Abstract
Plasmonic nanostructures with large absorption areas under resonant excitation have been utilized extensively in photon&#8208;assisted applications. In this work, dodecahedral Au nanobowls were first prepared by an easy and template&#8208;free method only through the introduction of H2PtCl6 and I&#8722; during the growth procedure. The Au nanobowls show electron&#8208;field enhancement due to the high curvature of the bowl edge, the open region, and dodecahedral morphology. Au/Pt nanobowls, which couple plasmonic Au and catalytic Pt, were then constructed as plasmonic electrocatalysts for methanol oxidation. The mass activity reached 497.6&#8197;mA&#8201;mg&#8722;1 under visible&#8208;light illumination, which is 1.9 times that measured in the dark. Simultaneously, the electrocatalytic stability is also greatly improved under light excitation. The enhanced properties of the plasmonic Au/Pt electrocatalysts are ascribed to the synergistic effect of the plasmon&#8208;enhanced photothermal and hot&#8208;carrier effects on the basis of experimental investigations. This work thus offers an effective methodology to construct efficient plasmonic electrocatalysts for fuel cells.

      <dc:description>Several non&#8208;hydrolytic sol&#8208;gel syntheses involving different precursors, oxygen donors, and conditions have been screened aiming to selectively produce mesoporous t&#8208;ZrO2 or m&#8208;ZrO2 with significant specific surface areas. The in situ water formation was systematically investigated by Karl Fisher titration of the syneresis liquids. XRD and nitrogen physisorption were employed to characterize the structure and texture of the ZrO2 samples. Significant amounts of water were found in several cases, notably in the reactions of Zr(OnPr)4 with ketones (acetone, 2&#8208;pentanone, acetophenone), and of ZrCl4 with alcohols (benzyl alcohol, ethanol) or acetone. Conversely, the reactions of Zr(OnPr)4 with acetic anhydride or benzyl alcohol at moderate temperature (200 &#176;C) and of ZrCl4 with diisopropyl ether appear strictly non&#8208;hydrolytic. Although reaction time and reaction temperature were also important parameters, the presence of water played a crucial role on the structure of the final zirconia: t&#8208;ZrO2 is favored in strictly non&#8208;hydrolytic routes, while m&#8208;ZrO2 is favored in the presence of significant amounts of water. 1H and 13C NMR analysis of the syneresis liquids allowed us to identify the main reactions responsible for the formation of water and of the oxide network. The morphology of the most interesting ZrO2 samples was further investigated by electron microscopy (SEM, TEM).</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning the Topological Landscape of DNA&#8208;Cyclodextrin Nanocomplexes by Molecular Design</title>
      <dc:description>Here we report original molecular vectors that ensure broad flexibility to tune the shape and surface properties of plasmid DNA (pDNA) condensates. The prototypic design involves a cyclodextrin (CD) platform bearing a polycationic cluster at the primary face and a doubly&#8208;linked aromatic module bridging two consecutive monosaccharide units at the secondary face, which behaves as a topology&#8208;encoding element. Subtle differences at the molecular level then translate into disparate morphologies at the nanoscale, including rods, worms, toroids, globules, ellipsoids and spheroids. In vitro evaluation of the transfection capabilities revealed marked selectivity differences as a function of nanocomplex morphology. Remarkably high transfection efficiencies were associated to ellipsoidal or spherical shapes with a lamellar internal arrangement of pDNA chains and CD bilayers. Computational studies support that the stability of such supramolecular edifices is directly related to the tendency of the molecular vector to form noncovalent dimers upon DNA templation. Since the stability of the dimers depends on the protonation state of the polycationic clusters, the co&#8208;aggregates display pH responsiveness, which facilitates endosomal scape and timely DNA release, a key step in successful transfection. The results provide a versatile strategy for the construction of fully synthetic and perfectly monodisperse non&#8208;viral gene delivery systems uniquely suited for optimization schemes.</dc:description>

      <title>A Click Chemistry Approach to Developing Molecularly Targeted DNA Scissors</title>
      <dc:description>Nucleic acid click chemistry was used to prepare a family of chemically modified triplex forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) for application as a new gene&#8208;targeted technology. Azide&#8208;bearing phenanthrene ligands&#8212;designed to promote triplex stability and copper binding&#8212;were &#8216;clicked&#8217; to alkyne&#8208;modified parallel TFOs.

Our studies have shown that imine&#8208;POSS is able to chelate metal ions like Zn(II) to form a unique coordination complex. The silsesquioxane core and the hindrance of the side arms (their steric effect) influence the construction process of the homoleptic  Zn4@POSS&#8208;1  complex.

      <title>Hierarchical Synthesis, Structure, and Photophysical Properties of Gallium&#8208; and Ruthenium&#8208;Porphyrins with Axially Bonded Azo Ligands</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract:  &#160;The hierarchical synthesis of&#160;three porphyrin&#160;and&#160;four&#160;bisporphyrin derivatives is presented. This strategy relies on the incorporation linkers based on azo moieties appended with pyridyl and/or acetylenic groups that facilitate axial coordination to Ga&#8208; and Ru&#8208;metalloporphyrins. These porphyrinic systems allow for a quantitative analysis of the effects of diamagnetic anisotropy (DA) using&#160;  1  H NMR spectroscopic and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses. A simple power&#8208;law relationship between the proton chemical shift and distance from the porphyrin core is experimentally outlined, which confirms previous theoretical predictions and shows that the limit of DA is about 2 nm. Photophysical properties of the azo&#8208;linked porphyrins are analyzed by UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, showing that significant&#160;  cis&#8208;trans  &#160;isomerization is not observed for azo ligands bound only to Ga&#8208;porphyrins. Incorporation of Ru&#8208;porphyrins to an azo ligand facilitates photoswitching behavior,&#160;but the process faces competition from decarbonylation of the Ru&#8208;porphyrin, and appreciable switching is only documented for&#160;  GaL1Ru  .</dc:description>

      <title>Hydrostibination of alkynes: A radical mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>The addition of Sb&#8208;H bonds to alkynes was reported recently as a new hydroelementation reaction that exclusively yields anti&#8208;Markovnikov  Z  &#8208;olefins from terminal acetylenes. We examine four possible mechanisms that are consistent with the observed stereochemical and regiochemical outcomes. A comprehensive analysis of solvent, substituent, isotope, additive, and temperature effects on hydrostibination reaction rates definitively refutes three ionic mechanisms involving closed&#8208;shell charged intermediates. Instead the data support a fourth pathway featuring open&#8208;shell neutral intermediates. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are consistent with this model, predicting an activation barrier that is in agreement with the experimental value (Eyring analysis) and a rate limiting step that is congruent with experimental kinetic isotope effect. We therefore conclude that hydrostibination of arylacetylenes is initiated by the generation of stibinyl radicals, which then participate in a cycle featuring Sb  II  and Sb  III  intermediates to yield the observed  Z  &#8208;olefins as products. This mechanistic understanding will enable rational evolution of hydrostibination as a methodology for accessing challenging products such as  Z  &#8208;olefins.</dc:description>

      <title>Helicity control in the aggregation of achiral squaraine dyes in solution and thin films</title>
      <dc:description>Squaraine dyes are well known for their strong absorption in the visible regime. Reports on chiral squaraine dyes are, however, scarce. To address this gap, we here report two novel chiral squaraine dyes and their achiral counterparts. The presented dyes are aggregated in solution and in thin films. A detailed chiroptical study shows that thin films formed by co&#8208;assembling the chiral dye with its achiral counterpart exhibit exceptional photophysical properties. The calculated dissymmetry factor  g  abs  of the co&#8208;assembled structures reaches a maximum when just 25% of the chiral dye are present in the mixture. The solid structures with the highest  g  abs  are achieved when the chiral dye is used solely as a director, rather than the structural component. The chiroptical data are further supported by selected spin&#8208;filtering measurements using mc&#8208;AFM. These findings provide a promising platform for investigating the relationship between the dissymmetry of a supramolecular structure and emerging material properties rather than a comparison between a chiral molecular structure and an achiral counterpart.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Controlling the activity of enzymes is an important feature for many processes in medicine, bioanalytics, and biotechnology. So far it was not successful to fully switch biocatalysts ON and OFF by thermoresponsive enzyme inhibitors. Here, we present poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s with IDA end groups (POx&#8208;IDA) that are LCST polymers and thus thermosensitive. They are capable of reversibly inhibiting the activity of horse radish peroxidase and laccase by more than 99%. Increasing the temperature makes the POx&#8208;IDA precipitate, which leads to 100% recovery of the respective enzyme activity. This switching cycle is fully reversible. The LCST of the POx&#8208;IDA can be tuned by varying the polymer composition to generate a wide range of switching windows.</dc:description>

      <title>Hybrid White Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells Based on a Blue Cationic Iridium(III) Complex and Red Quantum Dots</title>
      <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state white light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) show promising advantages of simple solution fabrication processes, low operation voltage and compatibility with air&#8208;stable cathode metals, which are required for lighting applications. To date, white LECs based on ionic transition metal complexes (iTMCs) have been shown higher device efficiencies than white LECs employing other types of materials. However, relatively lower emission efficiencies of red iTMCs limit further improvement in device performance. Alternatively, efficient red CdZnSeS/ZnS core&#8208;shell quantum dots are integrated with a blue iTMC to form a hybrid white LEC in this work. With achieving good carrier balance under a proper device architecture, peak external quantum efficiency and power efficiency reach 11.2% and 15.1 lm W  &#8208;1  , respectively. Such device efficiency is indeed higher than those of the reported white LECs employing host&#8208;guest iTMCs. Time and voltage dependent electroluminescent (EL) characteristics of the hybrid white LECs are studied with the evidence of the temporal evolution of emission zone position extracted by fitting the simulated and measured EL spectra. The working principles of the hybrid white LECs are clarified and the high device efficiency renders the proposed new white&#8208;emitting devices suitable for solid&#8208;state lighting technology.</dc:description>

      <title>Enhanced Electrocatalytic Activity of a Zinc Porphyrin for CO2 Reduction: Cooperative Effects of Triazole Units in the Second Coordination Sphere</title>
      <dc:description>The control of the second coordination sphere in a coordination complex plays an important role in improving catalytic efficiency. Herein, we report a zinc porphyrin complex  ZnPor8T  with multiple flexible triazole units comprising the second coordination sphere, as an electrocatalyst for the highly selective electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) to carbon monoxide (CO). This electrocatalyst converted CO  2  to CO with a Faradaic efficiency of 99% and a current density of &#8211;6.2 mA/cm  2  at &#8211;2.4 V vs Fc/Fc  +  in  N,N  &#8208;dimethylformamide using water as the proton source. Structure&#8208;function relationship studies were carried out on  ZnPor8T  analogs containing different numbers of triazole units and distinct triazole geometries; these unveiled that the triazole units function cooperatively to stabilize the CO  2  &#8208;catalyst adduct in order to facilitate intramolecular proton transfer. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating triazole units that function in a cooperative manner is a versatile strategy to enhance the activity of electrocatalytic CO  2  conversion.</dc:description>

      <title>High energy density heteroatom (O, N and S) enriched activated carbon in rational design of symmetric supercapacitor</title>
      <dc:description>Carbon&#8208;based symmetric supercapacitors (SCs) are known for their high power and long cyclability, making them an ideal candidate for power sources in new generation electronic devices. To boost their electrochemical performances, deriving activated carbon with heteroatoms like (N, O, and S) are highly desirable for increasing the specific capacitance. In this regard,&#160;self&#8208;doped heteroatoms activated carbon (AC) materials directly derived from bio&#8208;waste of the lima&#8208;bean shell by different KOH activation processes. The heteroatom enriched AC synthesized from 1:2 ratio of pretreated carbon and KOH (ONS@AC&#8208;2) shows excellent surface morphology with a large surface area of 1508 m2 g&#8208;1. As an SCs electrode material, the presence of heteroatoms (N and S) reduces the interfacial charge transfer resistance and increase the ion&#8208;accessible surface area which inherently provides additional pseudocapacitance. The ONS@AC&#8208;2 electrode attains a maximum specific capacitance (Csp) of 342 F g&#8208;1 at a specific current of 1 A g&#8208;1 in 1 M NaClO4 electrolyte at the wide potential window of 1.8 V. Moreover, as symmetric SCs the ONS@AC&#8208;2 electrode delivers a maximum Csc of 191 F g&#8208;1 with a maximum specific energy of 21.48 Wh kg&#8208;1 and high specific power of 14000 W kg&#8208;1 and excellent retention of its initial capacitance value (98%) even for 10000 cycles of charge/discharge. In addition, a flexible supercapacitor fabricated utilizing ONS@AC&#8208;2 electrodes and LiCl/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) based gel polymer electrolyte shows a maximum Csc of 119 F g&#8208;1 with considerable specific energy and power.</dc:description>

      <title>Structural design and synthesis of SnO2@C@Co&#8208;NC composite as high&#8208;performance anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
      <dc:description>To overcome the drawbacks of the structural instability and poor conductivity of SnO2&#8208;based anode materials, we designed and synthesized a hollow core&#8208;shell structured SnO2@C@Co&#8208;NC composite by employing the heteroatoms&#8208;doping and multi&#8208;confining strategy. This composite material displayed a much&#8208;reduced resistance for charge transfer and excellent cycling performance compared to the bare SnO2 NPs and SnO2@C composites. The doped heteroatoms and heterostructure boost the charge transfer, and the porous structure shortens the Li&#8208;ions diffusion pathway. Also, the volume expansion of SnO2 NPs was accommodated by the hollow space and restricted by the multi&#8208;shell of heteroatoms&#8208;doped carbon framework. As a result, this structured anode material delivered a high initial capacity of 1559.1 mA h g&#8208;1 at 50 mA g&#8208;1, and an initial charge capacity of 627.2 mA h g&#8208;1 at 500 mA g&#8208;1. Moreover, the discharge capacity could be maintained at 410.8 mA h g&#8208;1 after 500 cycles with an attenuation rate of only 0.069% per cycle. This multi&#8208;confined SnO2@C@Co&#8208;NC structure with superior energy density and durable lifespan is highly promising for the next&#8208;generation LIBs.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly Specific Recognition of Guanosine Using Engineered Base Excised Aptamers</title>
      <dc:description>Purines and their derivatives are highly important molecules in biology for nucleic acids synthesis, energy storage, and signaling. While many DNA aptamers have been obtained for binding adenine derivatives such as adenosine, AMP and ATP, the success for specific binding of guanosine has been limited. Instead of performing new aptamer selections, we report herein a base&#8208;excised strategy to engineer existing aptamers for binding guanosine. Both the Na+&#8208;binding aptamer and classical adenosine aptamer were manipulated as the base&#8208;excising scaffold. A total of seven guanosine aptamers were desined, in which a G16&#8208;deleted Na+&#8208;aptamer showed the highest binidng specificity and affinity for guanoisne, with an apparent Kd of 0.78 mM. Single monophosphate difference was recognizable. Both the aptamer scaffold generality and excised&#8208;site generality were systematically studied. Overall, this work provides a few guanosine binding aptamers by using non&#8208;SELEX method. It also provides deeper insights into engineering aptamers for molecular recognition.</dc:description>

      <title>Fluorine&#8208;18 Radiolabelling and Photophysical Characteristics of Multimodal PET&#8208;Fluorescence Molecular Probes</title>
      <dc:description>Positron emission tomography (PET)&#8208;fluorescence imaging is an emerging field of multimodality imaging seeking to attain synergy between the two techniques. The probes employed in PET&#8208;fluorescence imaging incorporate both a fluorophore and radioisotope which enable complementary information to be obtained from both imaging techniques  via  the administration of a single agent. Fluorine&#8208;18 is the most commonly used radioisotope in PET imaging and consequently many novel attempts to radiofluorinate various fluorophores have transpired over the past decade. In this review, the most relevant fluorine&#8208;18 labelled PET&#8208;fluorescence probes have been classified into four groups as per the implemented fluorophore: i) boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes, ii) cyanine dyes, iii) alternative organic fluorophores and iv) organometallics such as quantum dots (QDs) and rhenium complexes. The biological, radiochemical and photophysical properties of each probe have been systematically compared to aid future endevaours in PET&#8208;fluorescence chemistry.</dc:description>

In this review, the most relevant fluorine&#8208;18 labelled PET&#8208;fluorescence probes have been classified into four groups as per the implemented fluorophore: i) boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes, ii) cyanine dyes, iii) alternative organic fluorophores and iv) organometallics such as quantum dots (QDs) and rhenium complexes. The biological, radiochemical and photophysical properties of each probe have been systematically compared to aid future endevaours in PET&#8208;fluorescence chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Distinct helical molecular orbitals through conformational lock</title>
      <dc:description>Several theoretical studies have proposed strategies to generate helical molecular orbitals (Hel&#8208;MOs) in [n]cumulenes. While chiral even&#8208;[n] cumulenes feature Hel&#8208;MOs, odd&#8208;[n] cumulenes may also present them if the terminal groups lie on different planes. However, the proposed systems have been either experimentally unfeasible or resulted in opposite pseudo&#8208;degenerated Hel&#8208;MOs. We hereby demonstrate the introduction of a remarkable energy difference between helical orbitals of opposite twist by fixing the torsion angle between the terminal groups in butadiyne fragments. In order to experimentally lock the conformation of the terminal groups, we designed and synthesized cyclic architectures by combining acetylenes with chiral spirobifluorenes. The high stability of these systems with distinct helical orbitals allowed their isolation and full characterization. In our view these results constitute a milestone in the development of real systems presenting helical molecular orbitals.</dc:description>

      <title>Alternating Magnetic Field (AMF) Controlled Targeting Drug Delivery Based on Graphene Oxide&#8208;Grafted Nano&#8208;Supramolecules</title>
      <dc:description>Graphene oxide (GO)&#8208;grafted nano&#8208;supramolecules have been recently emerged as a neoteric nano&#8208;drug carrier in therapy of refractory diseases. Herein, we reported an original multicomponent nano&#8208;supramolecular drug carrier based on targeted peptide and magnetic GO whose behavior of drug releasing can be regulate by alternating magnetic field (AMF). This multicomponent nano&#8208;supramolecular carrier was composed of &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD)/nickel nanoparticle&#8208;modified graphene oxide (GONiCD) and mitochondrial ion&#8208;targeting peptide (MitP)&#8208;grafted hyaluronic acid (HAMitP). Owing to the host&#8208;guest interaction between &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin and the cyclohexyl groups on MitP, GONiCD and HAMitP could form supramolecular assemblies during the doxorubicin (Dox)&#8208;loading process, not only remarkably enhancing the drug&#8208;loading capacity, but also improving the drug&#8208;releasing efficiency under the stimulus of alternating magnetic field (AMF). During co&#8208;incubation with the tumor cells, the Dox&#8208;loading assemblies could strongly target the tumor mitochondria, and damage both the mitochondria and the nuclei, owing to Dox release from the assemblies induced by AMF. This study sheds a novel light on exploration of peptide caps for controlled drug loading/release of supramolecular nanocarriers for efficiently drug delivery and anti&#8208;cancer therapy.</dc:description>

      <title>A Reversible Liquid to Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carrier System Based on Ethylene Glycol and Ethanol</title>
      <dc:description>Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) are powerful systems for the efficient unloading and loading molecular hydrogen. Herein, a liquid to liquid organic hydrogen carrier system based on reversible dehydrogenative coupling of ethylene glycol (EG) with ethanol catalysed by ruthenium pincer complexes is reported. Noticeable advantages of the current LOHC system is that both reactants (hydrogen&#8208;rich components) and the produced esters (hydrogen&#8208;lean components) are liquids at room temperature, and the dehydrogenation process can be performed under solvent and base&#8208;free conditions. Moreover, the hydrogenation reaction proceeds under low hydrogen pressure (5 bar), and the LOHC system has a relatively high theoretical gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity (HSC &gt;5), presenting an attractive hydrogen storage system.</dc:description>

      <title>The Photoisomerization Pathway(s) of Push&#8208;Pull Phenylazoheteroarenes</title>
      <dc:description>Azoheteroarenes are the most recent derivatives targeted to further improve the properties of azo&#8208;based photoswitches. Their light&#8208;induced mechanism for trans&#8208;cis isomerization is assumed to be very similar to that of the parent azobenzene. As such, they inherited from the controversy about the dominant isomerization pathway (rotation vs. inversion) depending on the excited state (n&#960;* vs. &#960;&#960;*). While the controversy seems settled in azobenzene, the extent to which the same conclusions apply to the more structurally&#8208;diverse family of azoheteroarenes is unclear. Here, we unravel by means of non&#8208;adiabatic molecular dynamics, the photoisomerization mechanism of three prototypical phenyl&#8208;azoheteroarenes with an increasing push&#8208;pull character. The evolution of the rotational and inversion conical intersection energies, the preferred pathway, and the associated kinetics upon both n&#960;* and &#960;&#960;* excitations can be linked directly with the push&#8208;pull substitution effects. Overall, we clarify the working conditions of this family of azo&#8208;dyes and identify a possibility to exploit push&#8208;pull substituents to tune their photoisomerization mechanism, with potential impact on their quantum yield.</dc:description>

      <title>Multiscale approach of spin crossover materials &#8208; a concept mixing Russian dolls and domino effects</title>
      <dc:description>The spin crossover (SCO) phenomenon corresponds to a modification that originates at the atomic scale. However, the simple consideration of the transformations that occur following the SCO at this scale or in its close vicinity does not allow anyone to truly understand, anticipate and thus take advantage of what happens at the scale of the material, and even less at the device one. As the fruit of years of work and experience on this phenomenon, we formalize here the concept of the multiscale understanding of SCO. Clearly, the deflagration generated by the initial impressive atomic modification on all the physical scales of the solid must be understood in terms of structure&#8208;properties relationships that fit together, like Russian dolls, and propagate according to a kind of domino effect. Each scale can both give different and independent consequences from those of the other scales but at the same time can influence those of a larger or smaller scale, the whole being imperatively to take into account. The concept appears well illustrated by the volume modification, always the same at the atomic level but drastically different and adaptable, in amplitude and sense, at any other physical scale. This approach results in a much wider range of potential applications than the atomic level alone initially suggests, including one serious path to shape memory materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Fluorogenic Protein Probes with Red and Near&#8208;Infrared Emission for Genetically Targeted Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>Fluorogenic probes are important tools to image proteins with high contrast and no wash protocols. In this work, we rationally designed and synthesized a small set of four protein fluorogens with red or near&#8208;infrared emission. The fluorophores were characterized in the presence of albumin as a model protein environment and exhibited good fluorogenicity and brightness (fluorescence quantum yield up to 36 %). Once conjugated to a haloalkane ligand, the probes reacted with the protein self&#8208;labeling tag HaloTag with a high fluorescence enhancement (up to 156&#8208;fold). The spectroscopic properties of the fluorogens and their reaction with HaloTag were investigated  in vitro  experimentally and with the help of molecular dynamics. The two most promising probes, one in the red and one in the near&#8208;infrared range, were finally applied to image the nucleus or actin in live&#8208;cell and in wash&#8208;free conditions using fluorogenic and chemogenetic targeting of HaloTag fusion proteins.</dc:description>
