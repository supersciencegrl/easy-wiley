         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Stiffening and Non&#8208;Cell Adhesive Properties of Amphiphilic Peptides with Central Alkylene Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;In 2019, we reported characteristic properties, such as fiber bundling and hydrogel stiffening, of an amphiphilic peptide bearing a glycine residue at the center. With an increased interest in the effects of conformational flexibility, we synthesized a series of peptide variants with different central alkylene chain lengths in the present study to investigate their self&#8208;assembling and biological properties.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff.

         <title>Macrocyclic Complexes Derived from Four cis&#8208;L2Pt Corners and Four Butadiynediyl Linkers; Syntheses, Electronic Structures, and Square versus Skew Rhombus Geometries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Complexes with cyclic Pt4C16 cores comprised of platinum(II) corners and butadiynediyl edges were synthesized, and their geometric and electronic structures as well as spectroscopic and redox properties closely examined.







Abstract
The dialkyl malonate derived 1,3&#8208;diphosphines R2C(CH2PPh2)2 (R=a, Me; b, Et; c, n&#8208;Bu; d, n&#8208;Dec; e, Bn; f, p&#8208;tolCH2) are combined with (p&#8208;tol3P)2PtCl2 or trans&#8208;(p&#8208;tol3P)2Pt((C&#8801;C)2H)2 to give the chelates cis&#8208;(R2C(CH2PPh2)2)PtCl2 (2&#8201;a&#8211;f, 94&#8211;69&#8201;%) or cis&#8208;(R2C(CH2PPh2)2)Pt((C&#8801;C)2H)2 (3&#8201;a&#8211;f, 97&#8211;54&#8201;%). Complexes 3&#8201;a&#8211;d are also available from 2&#8201;a&#8211;d and excess 1,3&#8208;butadiyne in the presence of CuI (cat.) and excess HNEt2 (87&#8211;65&#8201;%). Under similar conditions, 2 and 3 react to give the title compounds [(R2C(CH2PPh2)2)[Pt(C&#8801;C)2]4 (4&#8201;a&#8211;f; 89&#8211;14&#8201;% (64&#8201;% avg)), from which ammonium salts such as the co&#8208;product [H2NEt2]+ Cl&#8722; are challenging to remove. Crystal structures of 4&#8201;a,b show skew rhombus as opposed to square Pt4 geometries. The NMR and IR properties of 4&#8201;a&#8211;f are similar to those of mono&#8208; or diplatinum model compounds. However, cyclic voltammetry gives only irreversible oxidations. As compared to mono&#8208;platinum or Pt(C&#8801;C)2Pt species, the UV&#8208;visible spectra show much more intense and red&#8208;shifted bands. Time dependent DFT calculations define the transitions and principal orbitals involved. Electrostatic potential surface maps reveal strongly negative Pt4C16 cores that likely facilitate ammonium cation binding. Analogous electronic properties of Pt3C12 and Pt5C20 homologs and selected equilibria are explored computationally.

         <title>Stabilization of Bicontinuous Cubic Phase and Its Two&#8208;Sided Nature Produced by Use of Siloxane Tails and Introduction of Molecular Nonsymmetry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bicontinuous cubic liquid crystalline (Cubbi LC) phase of Ia3d gyroid&#8208;type given by a nonsymmetric core molecule exhibits a two&#8208;sided nature by showing two core assembly modes specific to symmetric molecules with large cores or small cores, depending on temperature and thermal cycle. As another effect of the core nonsymmetry, the cubic phase is maintained at room temperature for more than 100&#8197;days with slight distortion.







Abstract
A recent intriguing finding that a helical network arrangement forms the bicontinuous cubic phase is attracting great attention for the possibility of new routes to asymmetric synthesis by achiral molecules. However, the design of the molecular structure for the cubic phase is still unrevealed. In this work, a nonsymmetric core molecule with larger naphthalene and smaller benzene moieties at each side of the central linkage and the same disiloxanyldecyloxy terminal at both terminals is shown to be the first example of molecule forming both single&#8208;layered and double&#8208;layered core assembly modes in the Ia3d phase as a single molecule system. The molecule forms the former mode at high temperatures as a thermodynamically stable phase, similarly to the symmetric naphthalene core system, whereas, on cooling below a temperature (&#8764;350&#8197;K), a metastable Ia3d phase forms a double&#8208;layered core state down to room temperature, which is common to the benzene core system. As another effect of the nonsymmetric core, the cubic phase is maintained at room temperature for more than 100&#8197;days with slight distortion. Infrared spectral studies and quantum chemical calculations suggested the easy transformation between the two core assembly modes. The core nonsymmetry can be a versatile fine&#8208;tuning of the core assembly mode and phase stability for the cubic phase molecules.

         <title>Building an Iron Chromophore Incorporating Prussian Blue Analogue for Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;All current dye&#8208;sensitized water oxidation electrodes rely on molecular ruthenium components, which suffer from high cost and low stability. Iron is the ideal candidate to replace ruthenium since they are in the same group. Herein, we show the first example of an iron&#8208;sensitized water oxidation photoanode by incorporating an iron chromophore into a Prussian blue network. This study indicates that the excited state lifetime of an iron chromophore could be extended by connecting it to a donor metal site in close proximity (Cover design: Kubra N. Ozvural).&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100654).

     alt="Building an Iron Chromophore Incorporating Prussian Blue Analogue for Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;&lt;i&gt;All current dye-sensitized water oxidation electrodes rely on molecular ruthenium components, which suffer from high cost and low stability. Iron is the ideal candidate to replace ruthenium since they are in the same group. Herein, we show the first example of an iron-sensitized water oxidation photoanode by incorporating an iron chromophore into a Prussian blue network. This study indicates that the excited state lifetime of an iron chromophore could be extended by connecting it to a donor metal site in close proximity (Cover design: Kubra N.

         <title>Comprehensive Characterization of the Self&#8208;Folding Cavitand Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex dynamic behavior of a self&#8208;folding cavitand receptor has been thoroughly characterized employing molecular dynamics simulations and 1H EXSY experiments. The exchange barriers extracted from accelerated molecular dynamics simulations are in very good agreement with experimentally determined values. Overall, the presented approach emerges as a useful tool for the rational design of dynamic host&#8208;guest systems.







Abstract
The conformational equilibria and guest exchange process of a resorcin[4]arene derived self&#8208;folding cavitand receptor have been characterized in detail by molecular dynamics simulations (MD) and 1H EXSY NMR experiments. A multi&#8208;timescale strategy for exploring the fluxional behaviour of this system has been constructed, exploiting conventional MD and accelerated MD (aMD) techniques. The use of aMD allows the reconstruction of the folding/unfolding process of the receptor by sampling high&#8208;energy barrier processes unattainable by conventional MD simulations. We obtained MD trajectories sampling events occurring at different timescales from ns to s: 1) rearrangement of the directional hydrogen bond seam stabilizing the receptor, 2) folding/unfolding of the structure transiting partially open intermediates, and 3) guest departure from different folding stages. Most remarkably, reweighing of the biased aMD simulations provided kinetic barriers that are in very good agreement with those determined experimentally by 1H NMR. These results constitute the first comprehensive characterization of the complex dynamic features of cavitand receptors. Our approach emerges as a valuable rational design tool for synthetic host&#8208;guest systems

         <title>Hierarchical Architectures Based on Ru Nanoparticles/Oxygen&#8208;Rich&#8208;Carbon Nanotubes for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen at high or low pH: Hierarchical oxygen&#8208;rich carbon nanotube architectures strongly trap Ru nanoparticles, and a Ru&#8722;O&#8722;C bond is formed from the strong interaction at Ru/OCNT interfaces. The obtained catalyst shows excellent catalytic activity and stability for the HER in both alkaline and acid electrolytes, and the high activity of the catalyst is further confirmed by density functional theory.







Abstract
Highly active and durable electrocatalysts are essential for producing hydrogen fuel through the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, a uniform deposition of Ru nanoparticles strongly interacting with oxygen&#8208;rich carbon nanotube architectures (Ru&#8208;OCNT) through ozonation and hydrothermal approaches has been designed. The hierarchical structure of Ru&#8208;OCNT is made by self&#8208;assembly of oxygen functionalities of OCNT. Ru nanoparticles interact strongly with OCNT at the Ru/OCNT interface to give excellent catalytic activity and stability of the Ru&#8208;OCNT, as further confirmed by density functional theory. Owing to the hierarchical structure and adjusted surface chemistry, Ru&#8208;OCNT has an overpotential of 34&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a Tafel slope of 27.8&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 in 1&#8197;M KOH, and an overpotential of 55&#8197;mV with Tafel slope of 33&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 in 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4. The smaller Tafel slope of Ru&#8208;OCNT than Ru&#8208;CNT and commercial Pt/C in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes indicates high catalytic activity and fast charge transfer kinetics. The as&#8208;proposed chemistry provides the rational design of hierarchically structured CNT/nanoparticle electrocatalysts for HER to produce hydrogen fuel.

         <title>Managing Experimental 3D Structures in the Beyond&#8208;Rule&#8208;of&#8208;5 Chemical Space: The Case of Rifampicin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bRo5 space includes large and flexible drug candidates which may assume different privileged conformations and exhibit chameleonic properties. We characterized the conformational ensembles of rifampicin in polar and nonpolar solvents and in the solid state. We performed NMR experiments, analyzed CSD structures and calculated a polarity descriptor. Results show that rifampicin is not a chameleon and its conformational behavior in solution and in the solid state is not superposable.







Abstract
The beyond&#8208;Rule&#8208;of&#8208;5 (bRo5) chemical space is a source of new oral drugs and includes large and flexible compounds. Because of their size and conformational variability, bRo5 molecules assume different privileged conformations in the compartments of human body, i.&#8201;e., they can exhibit chameleonic properties. The elucidation of the ensemble of 3D structures explored by such molecules under different conditions is therefore critical to check the role played by chameleonicity to modulate cell permeability. Here we characterized the conformational ensembles of rifampicin, a bRo5 drug, in polar and nonpolar solvents and in the solid state. We performed NMR experiments, analyzed their results with a novel algorithm and set&#8208;up a pool of ad hoc in silico strategies to investigate crystallographic structures retrieved from the CSD. Moreover, a polarity descriptor often related to permeability (SA&#8208;3D&#8208;PSA) was calculated for all the conformers and its variation with the environment analyzed. Results showed that the conformational behavior of rifampicin in solution and in the solid state is not superposable. The identification of dynamic intramolecular hydrogen bonds can be assessed by NMR spectroscopy but not by X&#8208;ray structures. Moreover, SA&#8208;3D&#8208;PSA revealed that dynamic IMHBs do not provide rifampicin with chameleonic properties. Overall, this study highlights that the peculiarity of rifampicin, which is cell permeable probably because of the presence of static IMHBs but is devoid of any chameleonic behavior, can be assessed by a proper analysis of experimental 3D structures.

Set&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;silver C: The base pair stability of anomeric (&#945;/&#946;&#8208;d) and enantiomeric (&#946;&#8208;l/&#946;&#8208;d) 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine mispair combinations in duplex DNA was studied in the absence and presence of silver ions. Stable duplexes with Ag+&#8208;mediated cytosine&#8211;cytosine pairs were formed by all anomeric and enantiomeric combinations. The Ag+&#8208;mediated base pair of anomeric &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;dC (&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine) with enantiomeric &#946;&#8208;l&#8208;dC (&#946;&#8208;l&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine) is superior to the well&#8208;noted &#946;&#8208;d/&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;dC pair in view of stability and Tm increase.







Abstract
Dodecamer duplex DNA containing anomeric (&#945;/&#946;&#8208;d) and enantiomeric (&#946;&#8208;l/&#946;&#8208;d) 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine mismatches was studied with respect to base pair stability in the absence and presence of silver ions. Stable duplexes with silver&#8208;mediated cytosine&#8211;cytosine pairs were formed by all anomeric and enantiomeric combinations. Stability changes were observed depending on the composition of the mismatches. Most strikingly, the new silver&#8208;mediated base pair of anomeric &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;dC with enantiomeric &#946;&#8208;l&#8208;dC is superior to the well&#8208;noted &#946;&#8208;d/&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;dC pair in terms of stability. CD spectra were used to follow global helical changes of DNA structure.

Most strikingly, the new silver-mediated base pair of anomeric &#945;-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-dC with enantiomeric &#946;-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-dC is superior to the well-noted &#946;-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;/&#946;-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-dC pair in terms of stability. CD spectra were used to follow global helical changes of DNA structure.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>C=C Bond Oxidative Cleavage of BODIPY Photocages by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocages for protection and controlled release of bioactive compounds have been widely investigated. However, the vast majority of these photocages have employed the cleavage of single bonds and high&#8208;energy ultraviolet light. The construction of a photoactivation system that uses a visible light to cleave unsaturated bonds still remains a challenge. Herein, we report a regioselective oxidative cleavage of C=C bond from a boron&#8208;dipyrrolemethene (BODIPY) based photocage by the illumination at 630 nm, resulting in a free aldehyde and a thiol fluorescent probe. This strategy was demonstrated in living HeLa cells and the generated &#945;&#8208;formyl&#8208;BODIPY allowed the real&#8208;time monitoring aldehyde release in the cells. In particular, we showed a mannose functionalized photocage can target HepG2 cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Inclusion Complexes of Gold(I)&#8208;Dithiocarbamates with &#223;&#8208;Cyclodextrin: A Journey from Drug Repurposing towards Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We identified the gold(I)&#8208;dithiocarbamate (dtc) complex [Au(N,N&#8208;diethyl)dtc]2 as the active cytotoxic agent in the combination treatment of sodium aurothiomalate and disulfiram on a panel of cancer cell lines. In addition to demonstrating pronounced differential cytotoxicity to these cell lines, the gold complex showed no cross&#8208;resistance in therapy&#8208;surviving cancer cells. In the course of a medicinal chemistry campaign on this class of poorly soluble gold(I)&#8208;dtc complexes, we synthesized &gt;35 derivatives and used x&#8208;ray crystallography to examine structural aspects of the dtc moiety. A group of hydroxy&#8208;substituted complexes has an improved solubility profile, and we found that these complexes form 2:1 host&#8211;guest inclusion complexes with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (CD), exhibiting a rarely observed &#8220;tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; arrangement of the CD cones.

         <title>Humins with Efficient Electromagnetic Wave Absorption: a By&#8208;Product of Furfural Conversion&#160; to Isopropyl Levulinate via a Tandem Catalytic Reaction in One&#8208;Pot</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Both one&#8208;pot catalytic conversion of furfural (FAL) to isopropyl levulinate (PL) and carbonization of by&#8208;product (humins) for electromagnetic wave absorption are discussed, which provides inspiration that humins can be applied to electromagnetic wave absorption. In the former, phosphotungstic acid (PW) is employed as a homogeneous catalyst to convert FAL to PL via a tandem reaction in one pot, with the formation of a vast amount of humins. With FAL and various intermediates as substrates, it was found that humins was a polymerization product of FAL, furfuryl alcohol (FOL) and furfuryl ester (FE) with furan rings. In addition, the  in&#8208;situ attenuated total reflection infrared (ATR&#8208;IR) spectra  also provided a basis for the proposed reaction route. In the latter, with the humins as raw material, P species and WO  3  doped nano&#8208;porous carbon (Humins&#8208;700) platform formed after high&#8208;temperature annealing is used for electromagnetic wave absorption and manifests desirable absorption performance. The minimum reflection loss (RL  min  ) value is &#8208;47.3 dB at 13.0 GHz with a thickness of 2.0 mm and the effective absorption bandwidth reaches 4.5 GHz (11.2 &#8211; 5.7 GHz).</dc:description>

         <title>Co3O4&#8722;CeO2 Nanocomposites for Low&#8208;Temperature CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co3O4&#8722;CeO2 nanocomposites with three different morphologies, that is, CeO2&#8208;supported Co3O4 layers, intermixed oxides, and homogeneously dispersed Co, were used for CO oxidation. Both CO&#8208;TPR and CO oxidation kinetics indicated that the layered structure exhibited the best performance for the same Co3O4 loading of 10.4&#8197;wt&#8201;%. The CO oxidation activity increased for higher Co3O4 amount, approaching activity comparable to Pt/CeO2.







Abstract
In an effort to combine the favorable catalytic properties of Co3O4 and CeO2, nanocomposites with different phase distribution and Co3O4 loading were prepared and employed for CO oxidation. Synthesizing Co3O4&#8208;modified CeO2 via three different sol&#8208;gel based routes, each with 10.4&#8197;wt&#8201;% Co3O4 loading, yielded three different nanocomposite morphologies: CeO2&#8208;supported Co3O4 layers, intermixed oxides, and homogeneously dispersed Co. The reactivity of the resulting surface oxygen species towards CO were examined by temperature programmed reduction (CO&#8208;TPR) and flow reactor kinetic tests. The first morphology exhibited the best performance due to its active Co3O4 surface layer, reducing the light&#8208;off temperature of CeO2 by about 200 &#176;C. In contrast, intermixed oxides and Co&#8208;doped CeO2 suffered from lower dispersion and organic residues, respectively. The performance of Co3O4&#8208;CeO2 nanocomposites was optimized by varying the Co3O4 loading, characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and N2 sorption (BET). The 16&#8211;65&#8197;wt&#8201;% Co3O4&#8722;CeO2 catalysts approached the conversion of 1&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt/CeO2, rendering them interesting candidates for low&#8208;temperature CO oxidation.

         <title>Single&#8208;Round DNA Aptamer Selection by Combined Use of Capillary Electrophoresis and Next Generation Sequencing: An Aptaomics Approach for Identifying Unique Functional Protein&#8208;Binding DNA Aptamers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA Aptaomics is proposed for finding functional DNA aptamers by a semi&#8208;comprehensive and quantitative single&#8208;round selection using capillary electrophoresis and next generation sequencing according to a selection rule based on analogous sequences. By mining sequence data obtained from sub&#8208;libraries with different DNA conformations, structure&#8208;induced (FRET type) aptamers for thrombin were reasonably selected for the first time.







Abstract
In DNA aptamer selection, existing methods do not discriminate aptamer sequences based on their binding affinity and function and the reproducibility of the selection is often poor, even for the selection of well&#8208;known aptamers like those that bind the commonly used model protein thrombin. In the present study, a novel single&#8208;round selection method (SR&#8208;CE selection) was developed by combining capillary electrophoresis (CE) with next generation sequencing. Using SR&#8208;CE selection, a successful semi&#8208;quantitative and semi&#8208;comprehensive aptamer selection for thrombin was demonstrated with high reproducibility for the first time. Selection rules based on dissociation equilibria and kinetics were devised to obtain families of analogous sequences. Selected sequences of the same family were shown to bind thrombin with high affinity. Furthermore, data acquired from SR&#8208;CE selection was mined by creating sub&#8208;libraries that were categorized by the functionality of the aptamers (e.&#8201;g., pre&#8208;organized aptamers versus structure&#8208;induced aptamers). Using this approach, a novel fluorescent molecular recognition sensor for thrombin with nanomolar detection limits was discovered. Thus, in this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept report, we have demonstrated the potential of a &#8220;DNA Aptaomics&#8221; approach to systematically design functional aptamers as well as to obtain high affinity aptamers.

Using this approach, a novel fluorescent molecular recognition sensor for thrombin with nanomolar detection limits was discovered. Thus, in this proof-of-concept report, we have demonstrated the potential of a &#8220;DNA Aptaomics&#8221; approach to systematically design functional aptamers as well as to obtain high affinity aptamers.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Isolation of a Uranium(III)&#8208;Carbon Multiple Bond Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
U(III)=C double bond: The first authentic isolable mononuclear U(III)&#8722;C double bond complex and a U(IV) analogue have been synthesized and fully characterized. Single&#8208;crystal structure analysis revealed that the U(III)=C bond is elongated by ca. 0.18&#8197;&#197; when compared to the U(IV)=C bond. DFT calculations revealed that the tridentate carbodiphosphorane (CDP) ligand served as a double donor towards uranium, forming polarized &#963; and &#960; dative bonds.







Abstract
Low&#8208;valent uranium&#8208;element multiple bond complexes remain scarce, though there is burgeoning interest regarding to their bonding and reactivity. Herein, isolation of a uranium(III)&#8208;carbon double bond complex [(Cp*)2U(CDP)](BPh4) (1) comprising a tridentate carbodiphosphorane (CDP) was reported for the first time. Oxidation of 1 afforded the corresponding U(IV) complex [(Cp*)2U(CDP)](BPh4)2 (2). The distance between U and C in 2 is 2.481&#8197;&#197;, indicating the existence of a typical U=C double bond, which is further confirmed by quantum chemical calculations. Bonding analysis suggested that the CDP also serves as both &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;donor in complex 1, though a longer U&#8722;C bond (2.666(3)&#8197;&#197;) is observed. It implies that 1 is the first isolable mononuclear uranium(III) carbene complex. Moreover, these results suggest that CDPs are promising ligands to establish other low&#8208;valent f&#8208;block metal&#8208;carbon multiple bond complexes.

         <title>Large Scale Synthesis of Three&#8208;dimensional Hierarchical Porous Framework with High Conductivity and its Application in Lithium Sulfur Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tremella is utilized as the precursor, a new process method (high&#8208;shear, freeze&#8208;drying and chemical activation are used in turn) is proposed, and an in&#8208;situ doped hierarchical porous biochar materials with adjustable 3D macro&#8208;meso&#8208;micropore is prepared successfully. Due to its unique physical structure, prepared cathode can still reach a reversible discharge capacity of 616&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a rate of 5&#8197;C. After 400 charge&#8208;discharge cycles at 1&#8197;C, the reversible capacity is maintained at 510.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Quick capacity loss due to the polysulfide shuttle effects and poor rate performance caused by low conductivity of sulfur have always been obstacles to the commercial application of lithium sulfur batteries. Herein, an in&#8208;situ doped hierarchical porous biochar materials with high electron&#8208;ion conductivity and adjustable three&#8208;dimensional (3D) macro&#8208;meso&#8208;micropore is prepared successfully. Due to its unique physical structure, the resulting material has a specific surface area of 2124.9&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a cumulative pore volume of 1.19&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1. The presence of micropores can effectively physically adsorb polysulfides and mesopores ensure the accessibility of lithium ions and active sites and give the porous carbon material a high specific surface area. The large pores provide channels for the storage of electrolyte and the transmission of ions on the surface of the substrate. The combined effect of these three kinds of pores and the N doping formed in&#8208;situ can effectively promote the cycle and rate performance of the battery. Therefore, prepared cathode can still reach a reversible discharge capacity of 616&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a rate of 5&#8197;C. After 400 charge&#8211;discharge cycles at 1&#8197;C, the reversible capacity is maintained at 510.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. This new strategy has provided a new approach to the research and industrial&#8208;scale production of adjustable hierarchical porous biochar materials.

         <title>Access to Indole&#8208;Fused Benzannulated Medium&#8208;Sized Rings through Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Cyclization of Azido&#8208;Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Because benzannulated and indole&#8208;fused medium&#8208;sized rings are found in many bioactive compounds, the combination of these fragments may lead to unexplored areas of biologically relevant and uncovered chemical space. Here we show that &#945;&#8208;imino gold carbene chemistry can play an important role in solving the difficulty in the formation of medium&#8208;sized rings. Namely, phenylene&#8208;tethered azido&#8208;alkynes undergo arylative cyclization through the formation of a gold carbene intermediate to afford benzannulated indole&#8208;fused medium&#8208;sized tetracycles. The reactions allow a range of different aryl substitution patterns and efficient access to these otherwise difficult&#8208;to&#8208;obtain medium&#8208;sized rings. This study also demonstrates the feasibility of the semihollow&#8208;shaped C&#8208;dtbm ligand for the construction of a nine&#8208;membered ring.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of 2&#8208;Arylindolines and 2,2&#8208;Disubstituted Indolines by Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Kinetic resolution of 2&#8208;arylindolines (2,3&#8208;dihydroindoles) was achieved by treatment of their  N  &#8208;  tert  &#8208;butoxycarbonyl (Boc) derivatives with  n  &#8208;butyllithium and sparteine in toluene at &#8211;78 &#176;C followed by electrophilic quench. The unreacted starting materials together with the 2,2&#8208;disubstituted products could be isolated with high enantiomer ratios. Variable temperature NMR spectroscopy showed that the rate of Boc rotation was fast (&#916;G  &#8225;  &#8776; 57 kJ/mol at 195 K). This was corroborated by DFT studies and by  in situ  ReactIR spectroscopy. The enantioenriched  N  &#8208;Boc&#8208;2&#8208;arylindolines were converted to 2,2&#8208;disubstituted products without significant loss in enantiopurity. Hence either enantiomer of the 2,2&#8208;disubstituted products could be obtained with high selectivity from the same enantiomer of the chiral ligand sparteine (one from the kinetic resolution and the other from subsequent lithiation&#8211;trapping of the recovered starting material). Secondary amine products were prepared by removing the Boc group with acid to provide a way to access highly enantioenriched 2&#8208;aryl and 2,2&#8208;disubstituted indolines.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Anionic Co(II) Metal&#8208;Organic Framework, with a High Density of Amino Groups, as a Superior Luminescent Sensor for Turn&#8208;on Al(III) Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accumulation of high concentrations of Al(III) in body has a direct impact on health and therefore, the trace detection of Al(III) has been a matter for substantial concern. An anionic metal organic framework ({[Me2NH2]0.5[Co(DATRz)0.5(NH2BDC)]&#8226;xG}n; 1; HDATRz = 3,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole, H2NH2&#8208;BDC = 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylic acid, G = guest molecule) composed of two types of secondary building units and channels of varying sizes is synthesized by employing a rational design mixed ligand synthesis approach. Free &#8211;NH2 groups on both the ligands are immobilized onto the pore surface of the MOF which acts as a superior luminescent sensor for turn&#8208;on Al(III) detection. Furthermore, the large channels could allow the counter&#8208;ions to pass through and get exchanged to selectively detect Al(III) in presence of other seventeen metal ions with magnificent luminescence enhancement.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Accumulation of high concentrations of Al(III) in body has a direct impact on health and therefore, the trace detection of Al(III) has been a matter for substantial concern. An anionic metal organic framework ({[Me2NH2]0.5[Co(DATRz)0.5(NH2BDC)]&#8226;xG}n; 1; HDATRz = 3,5-diamino-1,2,4-triazole, H2NH2-BDC = 2-amino-1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid, G = guest molecule) composed of two types of secondary building units and channels of varying sizes is synthesized by employing a rational design mixed ligand synthesis approach. Free &#8211;NH2 groups on both the ligands are immobilized onto the pore surface of the MOF which acts as a superior luminescent sensor for turn-on Al(III) detection. Furthermore, the large channels could allow the counter-ions to pass through and get exchanged to selectively detect Al(III) in presence of other seventeen metal ions with magnificent luminescence enhancement. The observed limit of detection is as low as 17.5 ppb, which is the lowest among the MOF-based sensors achieved so far. To make this detection approach simple, portable and economic, we demonstrate MOF filter paper test for real time naked eye observation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Selective Ortho&#8208;Directed Dicarboxylation of Cyclopentadiene by Methylcarbonates and CO2 or COS &#8211; First Insight into Co&#8208;ordination Chemistry of New Ambident Ligands</title>

A highly regioselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;dicarboxylated and &#8208;dithiocarboxylated cyclopentadienide salts [Cat]2[C5H3(CO2)2H] by reaction of organic cation methylcarbonate salts Cat[OCO2Me] (Cat=DMP+, NMe4+, EMMIm+) with cyclopentadiene or by reaction of CO2/COS with Cat[Cp] (Cat=DMP+, NMe4+, PPh4+) was developed. First insight into their coordination chemistry reveals ambident ligand behaviour following Pearsons acid&#8208;base concept. In some reactions with metal Lewis acids, a slow decarboxylation of the [C5H3(CO2)2H] ligand was observed. The mechanism is discussed.







Abstract
This research presents the highly regioselective syntheses of 1,2&#8208;dicarboxylated cyclopentadienide salts [Cat]2[C5H3(CO2)2H] by reaction of a variety of organic cation methylcarbonate salts [Cat]OCO2Me (Cat=NR4+, PR4+, Im+) with cyclopentadiene (CpH) or by simply reacting organic cation cyclopentadienides Cat[Cp] (Cat=NR4+, PR4+, Im+) with CO2. One characteristic feature of these dianionic ligands is the acidic proton delocalized in an intramolecular hydrogen bridge (IHB) between the two carboxyl groups, as studied by 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and XRD analyses. The reaction cannot be stopped after the first carboxylation. Therefore, we propose a Kolbe&#8208;Schmitt phenol&#8208;carboxylation related mechanism where the acidic proton of the monocarboxylic acid intermediate plays an ortho&#8208;directing and CO2 activating role for the second kinetically accelerated CO2 addition step exclusively in ortho position. The same and related thiocarboxylates [Cat]2[C5H3(COS)2H] are obtained by reaction of COS with Cat[Cp] (Cat=NR4+, PR4+, Im+). A preliminary study on [Cat]2[C5H3(CO2)2H] reveals, that its soft and hard coordination sites can selectively be addressed by soft Lewis acids (Mo0, Ru2+) and hard Lewis acids (Al3+, La3+).

Investigation of the coordination behavior of salicylidene glucosamine (H2L1) towards uranyl ions (UO22+) revealed the exclusive formation of a trinuclear anionic uranyl complex [(UO2)3(&#956;3&#8208;O)(L1)3]2&#8722; (12&#8722;), which was isolated by precipitation with the alkali metals ions Cs+, Rb+, and K+. Recrystallization of the Cs salt in the presence of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 in DMF led to the formation of the solvated ion pair [Cs(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)]21, in which coordination of the Cs+ ion by three uranyl oxygen atoms was observe.







Abstract
The reaction of UO2(OAc)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O with the biologically inspired ligand 2&#8208;salicylidene glucosamine (H2L1) results in the formation of the anionic trinuclear uranyl complex [(UO2)3(&#956;3&#8208;O)(L1)3]2&#8722; (12&#8722;), which was isolated in good yield as its Cs&#8208;salt, [Cs]21. Recrystallization of [Cs]21 in the presence of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 led to formation of a neutral ion pair of type [M(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)]21, which was also obtained for the alkali metal ions Rb+ and K+ (M=Cs, Rb, K). The related ligand, 2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;naphthylidene) glucosamine (H2L2) in a similar procedure with Cs+ gave the corresponding complex [Cs(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)]2[(UO2)3(&#956;3&#8208;O)(L2)3 ([Cs(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)]22). From X&#8208;ray investigations, the [(UO2)3O(Ln)3]2&#8722; anion (n=1, 2) in each complex is a discrete trinuclear uranyl species that coordinates to the alkali metal ion via three uranyl oxygen atoms. The coordination behavior of H2L1 and H2L2 towards UO22+ was investigated by NMR, UV/Vis spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, revealing the in&#8197;situ formation of the 12&#8722; and 22&#8722;dianions in solution.

         <title>A Cyclometalated IrIII Complex Conjugated to a Coumarin Derivative Is a Potent Photodynamic Agent against Prostate Differentiated and Tumorigenic Cancer Stem Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 33, Page 8547-8556, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclometalated IrIII complex conjugated to a far&#8208;red&#8208;emitting coumarin, IrIII&#8208;COUPY, is a very promising photosensitizer suitable for photodynamic therapy of cancer. It efficiently eliminates both prostate bulk, differentiated and prostate, hardly treatable cancer stem cells simultaneously and with a similar efficacy. Thus, photo&#8208;induced therapy with IrIII&#8208;COUPY conjugates, such as photodynamic therapy, might provide a new approach for prostate cancer treatment.







Abstract
A cyclometalated IrIII complex conjugated to a far&#8208;red&#8208;emitting coumarin, IrIII&#8208;COUPY (3), was recently shown as a very promising photosensitizer suitable for photodynamic therapy of cancer. Therefore, the primary goal of this work was to deepen knowledge on the mechanism of its photoactivated antitumor action so that this information could be used to propose a new class of compounds as drug candidates for curing very hardly treatable human tumors, such as androgen resistant prostatic tumors of metastatic origin. Conventional anticancer chemotherapies exhibit several disadvantages, such as limited efficiency to target cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are considered the main reason for chemotherapy resistance, relapse, and metastasis. Herein, we show, using DU145 tumor cells, taken as the model of hormone&#8208;refractory and aggressive prostate cancer cells resistant to conventional antineoplastic drugs, that the photoactivated conjugate 3 very efficiently eliminates both prostate bulk (differentiated) and prostate hardly treatable CSCs simultaneously and with a similar efficiency. Notably, the very low toxicity of IrIII&#8208;COUPY conjugate in the prostate DU145 cells in the dark and its pronounced selectivity for tumor cells compared with noncancerous cells could result in low side effects and reduced damage of healthy cells during the photoactivated therapy by this agent. Moreover, the experiments performed with the 3D spheroids formed from DU145 CSCs showed that conjugate 3 can penetrate the inner layers of tumor spheres, which might markedly increase its therapeutic effect. Also interestingly, this conjugate induces apoptotic cell death in prostate cancer DU145 cells associated with calcium signaling flux in these cells and autophagy.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A cyclometalated Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complex conjugated&lt;/b&gt; to a far-red-emitting coumarin, Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-COUPY, is a very promising photosensitizer suitable for photodynamic therapy of cancer. It efficiently eliminates both prostate bulk, differentiated and prostate, hardly treatable cancer stem cells simultaneously and with a similar efficacy. Thus, photo-induced therapy with Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-COUPY conjugates, such as photodynamic therapy, might provide a new approach for prostate cancer treatment.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cyclometalated Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complex conjugated to a far-red-emitting coumarin, Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-COUPY (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), was recently shown as a very promising photosensitizer suitable for photodynamic therapy of cancer. Therefore, the primary goal of this work was to deepen knowledge on the mechanism of its photoactivated antitumor action so that this information could be used to propose a new class of compounds as drug candidates for curing very hardly treatable human tumors, such as androgen resistant prostatic tumors of metastatic origin. Conventional anticancer chemotherapies exhibit several disadvantages, such as limited efficiency to target cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are considered the main reason for chemotherapy resistance, relapse, and metastasis. Herein, we show, using DU145 tumor cells, taken as the model of hormone-refractory and aggressive prostate cancer cells resistant to conventional antineoplastic drugs, that the photoactivated conjugate &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; very efficiently eliminates both prostate bulk (differentiated) and prostate hardly treatable CSCs simultaneously and with a similar efficiency. Notably, the very low toxicity of Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-COUPY conjugate in the prostate DU145 cells in the dark and its pronounced selectivity for tumor cells compared with noncancerous cells could result in low side effects and reduced damage of healthy cells during the photoactivated therapy by this agent. Moreover, the experiments performed with the 3D spheroids formed from DU145 CSCs showed that conjugate &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; can penetrate the inner layers of tumor spheres, which might markedly increase its therapeutic effect. Also interestingly, this conjugate induces apoptotic cell death in prostate cancer DU145 cells associated with calcium signaling flux in these cells and autophagy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that a photoactivatable metal-based compound is an efficient agent capable of killing even hardly treatable CSCs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Pentafluorophenyl Esters as Exchangeable Stoppers for the Construction of Photoactive [2]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 33, Page 8492-8499, June 10, 2021. </description>

Pillar[5]arene&#8208;containing [2]rotaxane building blocks bearing pentafluorophenyl ester functions have been prepared and stopper exchange reactions carried out to generate a wide range of [2]rotaxanes with amide, ester or thioester stoppers. Starting from a fullerene&#8208;functionalized pillar[5]arene derivative, this new strategy gave easy access to a photoactive [2]rotaxane incorporating a C60 moiety and two Bodipy stoppers.







Abstract
Stable pillar[5]arene&#8208;containing [2]rotaxane building blocks with pentafluorophenyl ester stoppers have been efficiently prepared on a multi&#8208;gram scale. Reaction of these building blocks with various nucleophiles gave access to a wide range of [2]rotaxanes with amide, ester or thioester stoppers in good to excellent yields. The rotaxane structure is fully preserved during these chemical transformations. Actually, the addition&#8208;elimination mechanism at work during these transformations totally prevents the unthreading of the axle moiety of the mechanically interlocked system. The stopper exchange reactions were optimized both in solution and under mechanochemical solvent&#8208;free conditions. While amide formation is more efficient in solution, the solvent&#8208;free conditions are more powerful for the transesterification reactions. Starting from a fullerene&#8208;functionalized pillar[5]arene derivative, this new strategy gave easy access to a photoactive [2]rotaxane incorporating a C60 moiety and two Bodipy stoppers. Despite the absence of covalent connectivity between the Bodipy and the fullerene moieties in this photoactive molecular device, efficient through&#8208;space excited state interactions have been evidenced in this rotaxane.

         <title>Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Iron Catalyst for Highly Enantioselective and Diastereoselective Hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 33, Page 8557-8563, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral&#8208;at&#8208;iron complex, in which all coordinated ligands are achiral and the overall chirality is exclusively due to a stereogenic iron center, catalyzes hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions with high diastereoselectivities (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr) and enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% ee). Key for this excellent stereocontrol are bulky 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl substituents at the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands which increase the steric hindrance at the catalytic site.







Abstract
This study demonstrates that chiral&#8208;at&#8208;iron complexes, in which all coordinated ligands are achiral and the overall chirality the consequence of a stereogenic iron center, are capable of catalyzing asymmetric transformations with very high enantioselectivities. The catalyst is based on a previously reported design (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2017, 139, 4322), in which iron(II) is surrounded by two configurationally inert achiral bidentate N&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;substituted N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes in a C2&#8208;symmetric fashion and complemented by two labile acetonitriles. By replacing mesityl with more bulky 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl substituents at the NHC ligands, the steric hindrance at the catalytic site was increased, thereby providing a markedly improved asymmetric induction. The new chiral&#8208;at&#8208;iron catalyst was applied to the inverse electron demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;ketoester and enol ethers provide 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrans in high yields with excellent diastereoselectivities (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% ee). Other electron rich dienophiles are also suitable as demonstrated for a reaction with a vinyl azide.

{P4W27} represents an extended and stabilized version of the elusive V&#8208;shaped dimer {P2W12}2, derived from the seminal Wells&#8208;Dawson&#8208;type phosphotungstate archetype, and offers a coordination pocket that can induce unusual oxygen coordination polyhedra, such as a trigonal prism for MnII.







Abstract
The propensity of the new, phenylphosphonate&#8208;stabilized polyoxotungstate [(C6H5PVO)2P4W24O92]16&#8722; to act as a precursor for new 3d metal&#8208;functionalized polyanions has been investigated. Reactions with MnII and CuII induce the formation of the previously unknown polyoxotungstate archetype {P4W27}, isolated as salts of the polyanions [Na&#8834;{MnII(H2O)}{WO(H2O)}P4W26O98]13&#8722; (1) and [K&#8834;{CuII(H2O)}{W(OH)(H2O)}P4W27O99]14&#8722; (2), which were characterized in the solid state (single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, elemental and TG analyses, IR spectroscopy, SQUID magnetometry) and in aqueous solution (UV/Vis spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry).

         <title>Controlled Synthesis of Large Single Crystals of Metal&#8208;Organic Framework CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni Prepared by a Modulation Approach: In situ Single&#8208;Crystal X&#8208;ray Diffraction Studies</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel mixed linker modulation approach yielded large single crystals of CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni, an analogue that has not yet been able to be studied via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction due to crystal size limitations. This study investigates the nitric oxide, an important therapeutic agent, gas loading behavior of CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni single crystals utilizing an in&#8197;situ gas cell setup using synchrotron radiation.







Abstract
The size of single crystals of the metal&#8208;organic framework CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni was incrementally increased through a series of modulated syntheses. A novel linker modulated synthesis using 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterephthalic acid and the isomeric ligand 4,6&#8208;dihydroxyisophthalic acid yielded large single crystals of CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni (&#8764;70&#8197;&#956;m). All materials were shown to have high crystallinity and phase purity through powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron microscopy methods, thermogravimetry, and compositional analysis. For the first time single&#8208;crystal structure analyses were carried out on CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni. High BET surface areas and nitric oxide (NO) release efficiencies were recorded for all materials. Large single crystals of CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni showed a prolonged NO release and proved suitable for in&#8197;situ single&#8208;crystal diffraction experiments to follow the NO adsorption. An efficient activation protocol was developed, leading to a dehydrated structure after just 4&#8197;h, which subsequently was NO&#8208;loaded, leading to a first NO loaded single&#8208;crystal structural model of CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni.

&lt;p&gt;A novel mixed linker modulation approach yielded large single crystals of CPO-27-Ni, an analogue that has not yet been able to be studied via single-crystal X-ray diffraction due to crystal size limitations. This study investigates the nitric oxide, an important therapeutic agent, gas loading behavior of CPO-27-Ni single crystals utilizing an &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; gas cell setup using synchrotron radiation.

Silylene? NHO Problem! Access to a new lithiated anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO) yields a complete acyclic divinyltetrelene series.







Abstract
The synthesis of the new bulky vinyllithium reagent (MeIPr=CH)Li, (MeIPr=[(MeCNDipp)2C]; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) is reported. This vinyllithium precursor was found to act as a general source of the anionic 2&#963;, 2&#960;&#8208;electron donor ligand [MeIPr=CH]&#8722;. Furthermore, a high&#8208;yielding route to the degradation&#8208;resistant SiII precursor MeIPr&#8901;SiBr2 is presented. The efficacy of (MeIPr=CH)Li in synthesis was demonstrated by the generation of a complete inorganic divinyltetrelene series (MeIPrCH)2E: (E=Si to Pb). (MeIPrCH)2Si: represents the first two&#8208;coordinate acyclic silylene not bound by heteroatom donors, with dual electrophilic and nucleophilic character at the SiII center noted. Cyclic voltammetry shows this electron&#8208;rich silylene to be a potent reducing agent, rivalling the reducing power of the 19&#8208;electron complex cobaltocene (Cp2Co).

         <title>G4 Sensing Pyridyl&#8208;Thiazole Polyamide Represses c&#8208;KIT Expression in Leukemia Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 33, Page 8590-8599, June 10, 2021. </description>

A pyridyl bis&#8208;thiazole, TPW preferentially binds to c&#8208;KIT1 G&#8208;quadruplex over other G&#8208;quadruplexes and duplex DNA and emits high fluorescence inside cell nuclei. Despite being less toxic, it represses c&#8208;KIT transcription in cancer cells. These unique properties of TPW could be useful for the detection of G&#8208;quadruplexes and nuclear labeling of cancer cells.







Abstract
Specific sensing and functional tuning of nucleic acid secondary structures remain less explored to date. Herein, we report a thiazole polyamide TPW that binds specifically to c&#8208;KIT1 G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) with sub&#8208;micromolar affinity and &#8764;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry and represses c&#8208;KIT proto&#8208;oncogene expression. TPW shows up to 10&#8208;fold increase in fluorescence upon binding with c&#8208;KIT1 G4, but shows weak or no quantifiable binding to other G4s and ds26 DNA. TPW can increase the number of G4&#8208;specific antibody (BG4) foci and mark G4 structures in cancer cells. Cell&#8208;based assays reveal that TPW can efficiently repress c&#8208;KIT expression in leukemia cells via a G4&#8208;dependent process. Thus, the polyamide can serve as a promising probe for G&#8208;quadruplex recognition with the ability to specifically alter c&#8208;KIT oncogene expression.

         <title>Selective, pH&#8208;Dependent Colorimetric and Fluorimetric Detection of Quadruplex DNA with 4&#8208;Dimethylamino(phenyl)&#8208;Substituted Berberine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 33, Page 8580-8589, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The very weak fluorescence of 4&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl&#8208;substituted berberines only increases significantly if both their conformational flexibility is strongly restricted, i.&#8201;e. in viscous medium or when bound to quadruplex DNA, and the amino group is protonated at low pH. This requirement of a dual stimulation to cause a light&#8208;up effect enables the spectrometric detection of quadruplex DNA at pH&#8197;5.







Abstract
The 9&#8208; and 12&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl&#8208;substituted berberine derivatives 3&#8201;a and 3&#8201;b were readily synthesized by Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions and shown to be useful fluorescent probes for the optical detection of quadruplex DNA (G4&#8208;DNA). Their association with the nucleic acids was investigated by spectrometric titrations, CD and LD spectroscopy, and with DNA&#8208;melting analysis. Both ligands bind to duplex DNA by intercalation and to G4&#8208;DNA by terminal &#960; stacking. At neutral conditions, they bind with higher affinity (Kb=105&#8722;106&#8197;M&#8722;1) to representative quadruplex forming oligonucleotides 22AG, c&#8208;myc, c&#8208;kit, and a2, than to duplex calf thymus (ct) DNA (Kb=5&#8208;7&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1). At pH&#8197;5, however, the affinity of 3&#8201;a towards G4&#8208;DNA 22AG is higher (Kb=1.2&#215;106&#8197;M&#8722;1), whereas the binding constant towards ct DNA is lower (Kb=3.9&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1) than under neutral conditions. Notably, the association of the ligand with DNA results in characteristic changes of the absorption and emission properties under specific conditions, which may be used for optical DNA detection. Other than the parent berberine, the ligands do not show a noticeable increase of their very low intrinsic emission intensity upon association with DNA at neutral conditions. In contrast, a fluorescence light&#8208;up effect was observed upon association to duplex (&#934;fl=0.01) and quadruplex DNA (&#934;fl=0.04) at pH&#8197;5. This fluorimetric response to G4&#8208;DNA association in combination with the distinct, red&#8208;shifted absorption under these conditions provides a simple and conclusive optical detection of G4&#8208;DNA at lower pH.

         <title>High&#8208;Quality Thin Films of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 by Coordination Modulated Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Liquid Phase Epitaxy</title>

Dense, crack&#8208;free, and crystalline UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 thin films were grown on silicon dioxide surfaces by coordination modulated liquid phase epitaxy (CM&#8208;LPE). In a stepwise process, the substrate was alternatively immersed in Zr6O4(OH)4(OMc)12 and H2&#8208;bdc&#8208;NH2 ethanol solutions which both contain methacrylic acid as a coordination modulator. For optimal thin film quality, the ideal activation of the SiO2 substrate prior to the thin film growth is key, whereby piranha acid is superior to ozone treatment.







Abstract
We report the fabrication of macroscopically and microscopically homogeneous, crack&#8208;free metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 (UiO: Universitetet i Oslo; [Zr6O4(OH)4(bdc&#8208;NH2)6]; bdc&#8208;NH22&#8722;: 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzene dicarboxylate) thin films on silicon oxide surfaces. A DMF&#8208;free, low&#8208;temperature coordination modulated (CM), layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) using the controlled secondary building block approach (CSA). Efficient substrate activation was determined as a key factor to obtain dense and smooth coatings by comparing UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 thin films grown on ozone and piranha acid&#8208;activated substrates. Films of 2.60&#8197;&#956;m thickness with a minimal surface roughness of 2&#8197;nm and a high sorption capacity of 3.53&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 MeOH (at 25&#8201;&#176;C) were typically obtained in an 80&#8208;cycle experiment at mild conditions (70&#8201;&#176;C, ambient pressure).

         <title>Bis(Iminophosphorano)&#8208;Substituted Pyridinium Ions and their Corresponding Bispyridinylidene Organic Electron Donors</title>

Optimized synthetic routes to pyridinium ions featuring two strongly &#960;&#8208;donating R3P=N&#8722; substituents are presented. These substituents cause severe disruption in aromaticity in these cations, and also impart exceptional reducing ability to the related bispyridinylidenes (neutral 2 e&#8208; donors). Preliminary reactivity studies show some enhanced reducing capabilities owing to the low redox potential of the bispyridinylidene.







Abstract
Optimized synthetic procedures for pyridinium ions featuring iminophosphorano (&#8722;N=PR3; R=Ph, Cy) &#960;&#8208;donor substituents in the 2&#8208; and 4&#8208; positions are described. Crystallographic and theoretical studies reveal that the strongly donating substituents severely polarize the &#960;&#8208;electrons of the pyridyl ring at the expense of aromaticity. Moreover, the pyridinium ions are readily deprotonated to generate powerful bispyridinylidene (BPY) organic electron donors. Electrochemical studies show exceptionally low redox potentials for the two&#8208;electron BPY/BPY2+ couples, ranging from &#8722;1.71&#8197;V vs the saturated calomel electrode for 3PhPh (with four Ph3P=N&#8722; groups) to &#8722;1.85&#8197;V for 3CyCy (with four Cy3P=N&#8722; groups). These new compounds represent the most reducing neutral organic electron donors (OEDs) currently known. Some preliminary reductions involving 3CyCy showed enhanced capability owing to its low redox potential, such as the thermally activated reduction of an aryl chloride, but purification challenges were often encountered.

         <title>Scaling Up DNA Origami Lattice Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 33, Page 8564-8571, June 10, 2021. </description>

The surface&#8208;assisted assembly of DNA origami lattices is a promising technique for fabricating functional surfaces. Here, the formation of a homogeneous DNA origami lattice on mica over a total surface area of 18.75 cm2 is demonstrated. Atomic force and fluorescence microscopy mapping reveal the high uniformity and homogeneity of the lattice over almost the entire surface area. The total DNA costs amount to &#8364;0.12 per cm2.







Abstract
The surface&#8208;assisted hierarchical assembly of DNA origami nanostructures is a promising route to fabricate regular nanoscale lattices. In this work, the scalability of this approach is explored and the formation of a homogeneous polycrystalline DNA origami lattice at the mica&#8208;electrolyte interface over a total surface area of 18.75&#8197;cm2 is demonstrated. The topological analysis of more than 50 individual AFM images recorded at random locations over the sample surface showed only minuscule and random variations in the quality and order of the assembled lattice. The analysis of more than 450 fluorescence microscopy images of a quantum dot&#8208;decorated DNA origami lattice further revealed a very homogeneous surface coverage over cm2 areas with only minor boundary effects at the substrate edges. At total DNA costs of &#8364;&#8197;0.12 per cm2, this large&#8208;scale nanopatterning technique holds great promise for the fabrication of functional surfaces.

         <dc:description>
Polysaccharides are an important element in several fields such as endocrinology, drug delivery, and vaccine. This Importance comes from their biocompatibility, safety, and cost efficiency. Moreover, the ability to chemically modify and functionalize polysaccharides with a large spectrum of functional groups expands their usability. In addition, chemical modifications of polysaccharide can alter their physicochemical properties. For these reasons, researchers have studied distinct features of modified polysaccharides to perfect their properties and better their pharmacological actions. For more details see the Review by A. Elaissar et&#8197;al. on 8437&#8197;ff.

Saccharify your uranyl ions! The cover art shows a cotton candy machine at a country fair. By feeding uranyl ions and a sugar&#8208;based ligand into it, a trinuclear uranyl complex is formed, illustrated as cotton candy. The complex shows the coordination motive of three uranyl ions in the core, bridged by a central &#956;3&#8208;oxo ligand, surrounded by the three sugar ligands. This work presents spectroscopic investigations into the complex formation and its self&#8208;assembly. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;J. Weigand et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100546).

         <title>Cover Feature: Pentafluorophenyl Esters as Exchangeable Stoppers for the Construction of Photoactive [2]Rotaxanes (Chem. Eur. J. 33/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 33, Page 8408-8408, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rotaxane building blocks with pentafluorophenyl ester stoppers have been efficiently prepared and their treatment with various nucleophiles provided a wide range of rotaxanes with amide, ester or thioester stoppers. This new strategy also gave easy access to a photoactive rotaxane incorporating a fulleropillar[5]arene moiety and two Bodipy stoppers. Despite the absence of covalent connectivity between the Bodipy subunits and the fullerene, efficient through space excited state interactions have been evidenced in this rotaxane. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8208;F. Nierengarten et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100943).

         <title>Cover Feature: Supramolecular Alloys from Fluorinated Hybrid Tri4Di6 Imine Cages (Chem. Eur. J. 33/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 33, Page 8409-8409, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eight hybrid Tri4Di6 imine cages with a tuneable degree of fluorination and one fully fluorinated Tri4Di6 imine cage are formed by [4+6] dynamic imine condensation in solution. These cages with unlimited miscibility in the solid state were obtained as highly crystalline samples after recrystallization and even showed retention of the crystal lattice, forming essentially organic cage alloys mixing fluorinated and non&#8208;fluorinated building blocks, depicted as golden honeycomb&#8208;like structure. More information can be found in the Communication by B.&#8197;M. Schmidt et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100891).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 33, Page 8406-8406, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper oxide subnanoparticles with sizes of &#8764;1&#8197;nm, which were prepared using a dendritic phenylazomethine template, exhibit the lowest CuII&#8594;CuI reduction temperature directly observed by in situ XAFS measurements during temperature&#8208;programmed reduction (TPR) with H2. The CuO particles with low atomicity easily release oxygen atoms because of their surface&#8208;strained structure and the unprecedented elongation of their Cu&#8722;O bonds.

         <title>Polysaccharide Chemistry in Drug Delivery, Endocrinology, and Vaccines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 33, Page 8437-8451, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the importance of using polysaccharide in disease treatment. They are a natural component that can be deployed as drugs and drug enhancers through chemical simple modifications leading to low&#8208;cost natural medicine. Polysaccharide have recently been used for pioneering work in endocrinology, drug delivery, and vaccines.







Abstract
Polysaccharides, due to their outstanding properties, have attracted the attention of researchers, working in the biomedical field and especially of those working in drug delivery. Modified/functionalized polysaccharides further increase the importance for various applications. Delivery of therapeutics for diverse ailments in different endocrine glands and hormones safely, is a focal point of researchers working in the field. Among the routes followed, the transdermal route is preferred due to non&#8208;exposure of active moieties to the harsh gastric environment and first&#8208;pass metabolism. This review starts with the overview of polysaccharides used for the delivery of various therapeutic agents. Advantages of polysaccharides used in the transdermal route are addressed in detail. Types of polysaccharides will be elaborated through examples, and in this context, special emphasis will be on the polysaccharides being used for synthesis of the membranes/films. Techniques employed for their modification to design novel carriers for therapeutics delivery will also be discussed. The review will end with a brief discussion on recent developments and future perspectives for delivery of therapeutic agents, and vaccine development.

Obstinate auxiliaries: How can directing groups be removed after successful C&#8722;H activation or transition metal&#8208;catalyzed functionalization? This Review discusses different strategies for 8&#8208;aminoquinoline removal to access a wide variety of products. Challenges and limitations are highlighted and alternative approaches are suggested to provide a comprehensive end&#8208;users&#8217; guide to directing group removal.







Abstract
The use of directing groups allows high levels of selectivity to be achieved in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed transformations. Efficient removal of these auxiliaries after successful functionalization, however, can be very challenging. This review provides a critical overview of strategies used for removal of Daugulis&#8217; 8&#8208;aminoquinoline (2005&#8211;2020), one of the most widely used N,N&#8208;bidentate directing groups. The limitations of these strategies are discussed and alternative approaches are suggested for challenging substrates. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive end&#8208;users&#8217; guide for chemists in academia and industry who want to harness the synthetic power of directing groups&#8212;and be able to remove them from their final products.

         <title>Hypervalent&#8208;Iodine(III)&#8208;Mediated Tandem Oxidative Dearomatization/Aziridination of Phenolic Amines: Synthesis of Functionalized Unactivated Aziridines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 33, Page 8473-8478, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented tandem reaction (oxidative dearomatization/aziridination) of phenolic amines in the presence of hypervalent&#8208;iodine(III) reagent is described. This cascade reaction shows a chemical unification of the oxidative reactivity of phenol and aliphatic primary amine in the chemistry of dearomatization and aziridination, thus providing a new method for the synthesis of unactivated aziridines with dense functionalization.







Abstract
A new hypervalent&#8208;iodine(III)&#8208;mediated tandem reaction involving oxidative dearomatization and in&#8197;situ aziridination of phenolic amines is described, providing a mild and effective method for the assembly of structurally interesting and synthetically useful aziridines. Importantly, the densely functionalized aziridines resulting from this unprecedented tandem reaction offer a platform for expeditious access to architecturally diverse aza&#8208;heterocycles through transformations initiated by selective ring&#8208;opening of aziridines.

         <title>Uniform Nanowires Containing a Heterogeneous&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Core of Controlled Length, Composition and Morphology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 33, Page 8479-8483, June 10, 2021. </description>

Heterojunction nanowires containing a heterogeneous &#960;&#8208;conjugated core of controlled length, composition and morphology were generated by co&#8208;self&#8208;seeding and &#8220;heating/cooling&#8221;&#8208;seeded growth approaches in spite of distinct molecular size and conformation of &#960;&#8208;conjugated units.







Abstract
In this work, it is demonstrated for the first time that heterojunction nanowires, consisting of a gradient and segmented&#8208;like heterogeneous &#960;&#8208;conjugated core with controllable length, composition and morphology, can be generated by co&#8208;self&#8208;seeding of oligo(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (OPV)&#8208; and oligo(p&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) (OPE)&#8208;containing block copolymers in spite of different chain lengths and molecular conformation for OPE and OPV. More importantly, based on the understanding of the formation of heterogeneous core by the co&#8208;self&#8208;seeding approach, a &#8220;heating/cooling&#8221; seeded growth route was developed, by which linear and branched heterojunction nanowires containing a segmented heterogeneous &#960;&#8208;conjugated core of controlled length, composition and morphology can be obtained. This work provides a versatile platform to generate heterojunction nanowires with excellent controllability in length, composition, and morphology.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature H2 Reduction of Copper Oxide Subnanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 33, Page 8452-8456, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lowering of the CuII&#8594;CuI reduction temperature for subnano CuO particles (ca. 1&#8197;nm) was demonstrated, compared to the nanoparticles, which was monitored by in&#8197;situ XAFS H2&#8208;TPR experiments. The enhanced performance with a release of the atomic oxygen from the copper oxide is attributed to the surface&#8208;strained structure and the elongation of the Cu&#8722;O bonds.







Abstract
Subnanoparticles (SNPs) with sizes of approximately 1&#8197;nm are attractive for enhancing the catalytic performance of transition metals and their oxides. Such SNPs are of particular interest as redox&#8208;active catalysts in selective oxidation reactions. However, the electronic states and oxophilicity of copper oxide SNPs are still a subject of debate in terms of their redox properties during oxidation reactions for hydrocarbons. In this work, in&#8197;situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements of Cu28Ox SNPs, which were prepared by using a dendritic phenylazomethine template, during temperature&#8208;programmed reduction (TPR) with H2 achieved lowering of the temperature (T50=138&#8201;&#176;C) reported thus far for the CuII&#8594;CuI reduction reaction because of Cu&#8722;O bond elongation in the ultrasmall copper oxide particles.

         <title>Oxidative Coordination versus C3&#8722;C(O)Me Bond Cleavage in Acetylacetonate Iridium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 33, Page 8468-8472, June 10, 2021. </description>

The key role of olefin co&#8208;ligands in the reactivity of IrI precursors toward alkylidenediketone, pyCH=C(COMe)2, is shown. In this regard, 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene and cyclooctene induce the oxidative coordination of the above&#8208;mentioned alkylidenediketone, leading to the formation of new iridabicyclic complexes. By contrast, dimethylbutadiene promotes at room temperature C3&#8722;COMe bond cleavage of the alkylidenediketone.







Abstract
Iridabicycles [Ir{&#954;3&#8208;N,C,O&#8208;(pyC(H)=C(C(O)Me)2}(Cl)(L&#8722;L)](L&#8722;L=cod (cod=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene), 1&#8201;a; bipy (bipy=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine), 1&#8201;b) have been obtained by oxidative coordination of 3&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;methylene)pentane&#8208;2,4&#8208;dione L1, to the complexes [{Ir(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(cod)}2] and [{Ir(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(coe)2}2] (coe=cis&#8208;cyclooctene), the latter in the presence of bipy. Remarkably, cleavage of the C3&#8722;C(O)Me bond of L1 has instead been achieved in the reaction with [Ir(Cl)(dmb)2] (dmb=2,3&#8208;dimethylbutadiene), yielding a compound formulated as [Ir{&#954;2&#8208;N,C&#8208;(pyC(H)C(C(O)Me))}(CO)(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(Me)]2, 2. Treatment of dimer 2 with DMSO or PMe3 produced the complexes[Ir{&#954;2&#8208;N,C&#8208;(pyC(H)C(C(O)Me)}(CO)Cl(Me)L] (L=DMSO, 3&#8201;a; PMe3, 3&#8201;b). Plausible mechanisms for the reactions leading to complexes 1 and 2 are proposed by means of DFT calculations.

&lt;p&gt;Iridabicycles [Ir{&#954;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-N,C,O-(pyC(H)=C(C(O)Me)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}(Cl)(L&#8722;L)](L&#8722;L=cod (cod=1,5-cyclooctadiene), &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;; bipy (bipy=2,2&#8217;-bipyridine), &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;) have been obtained by oxidative coordination of 3-(pyridine-2-yl-methylene)pentane-2,4-dione &lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt;, to the complexes [{Ir(&#956;-Cl)(cod)}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] and [{Ir(&#956;-Cl)(coe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (coe=&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-cyclooctene), the latter in the presence of bipy. Remarkably, cleavage of the C&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;C(O)Me bond of &lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt; has instead been achieved in the reaction with [Ir(Cl)(dmb)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (dmb=2,3-dimethylbutadiene), yielding a compound formulated as [Ir{&#954;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-N,C-(pyC(H)C(C(O)Me))}(CO)(&#956;-Cl)(Me)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;. Treatment of dimer &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; with DMSO or PMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; produced the complexes[Ir{&#954;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-N,C-(pyC(H)C(C(O)Me)}(CO)Cl(Me)L] (L=DMSO, &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;; PMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;). Plausible mechanisms for the reactions leading to complexes &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; are proposed by means of DFT calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synthesis of Gold(I)&#8722;Trifluoromethyl Complexes and their Role in Generating Spectroscopic Evidence for a Gold(I)&#8722;Difluorocarbene Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 33, Page 8461-8467, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method to access [Au(CF3)(NHC)] complexes has been developed, leading to the discovery of a new trimethylsilyl incorporated gold&#8722;NHC trifluoromethyl complex. This, in turn, led to the development of a new and straightforward strategy for the &#8220;one fluoride&#8221; abstraction affording, for the first time, spectroscopic evidence of the corresponding gold(I)&#8722;NHC difluorocarbene analogue.







Abstract
Readily prepared and bench&#8208;stable [Au(CF3)(NHC)] compounds were synthesized by using new methods, starting from [Au(OH)(NHC)], [Au(Cl)(NHC)] or [Au(L)(NHC)]HF2 precursors (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene). The mechanism of formation of these species was investigated. Consequently, a new and straightforward strategy for the mild and selective cleavage of a single carbon/fluorine bond from [Au(CF3)(NHC)] complexes was attempted and found to be reversible in the presence of an additional nucleophilic fluoride source. This straightforward technique has led to the unprecedented spectroscopic observation of a gold(I)&#8722;NHC difluorocarbene species.

         <title>Supramolecular Alloys from Fluorinated Hybrid Tri4Di6 Imine Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 33, Page 8457-8460, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular alloy, freely composed of eight hybrid Tri4Di6 imine cages with a tunable degree of fluorination can be created with high crystallinity. Although the fluorinated and the non&#8208;fluorinated building blocks used herein differ vastly in reactivity, gaining control over the outcome of the self&#8208;assembly process was achieved by carefully controlling the feed ratio.







Abstract
To create innovative materials, efficient control and engineering of pore sizes and their characteristics, crystallinity and stability is required. Eight hybrid Tri4Di6 imine cages with a tunable degree of fluorination and one fully fluorinated Tri4Di6 imine cage are investigated. Although the fluorinated and the non&#8208;fluorinated building blocks used herein differ vastly in reactivity, it was possible to gain control over the outcome of the self&#8208;assembly process, by carefully controlling the feed ratio. This represents the first hybrid material based on fluorinated/hydrogenated porous organic cages (POCs). These cages with unlimited miscibility in the solid state were obtained as highly crystalline samples after recrystallization and even showed retention of the crystal lattice, forming alloys. All mixtures and the fully fluorinated Tri4Di6 imine cage were analyzed by MALDI&#8208;MS, single&#8208;crystal XRD, powder XRD and in regard to thermal stability (TGA).

         <title>Synthesis of Cu&#8208;modified Nickel Oxide Nanocrystals and Their Applications as Hole&#8208;injection layers for Quantum&#8208;Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solution&#8208;processed NiO  x  thin films have been applied as hole&#8208;injection layers (HILs) in quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs). The commonly used NiO  x  HILs are prepared by the precursor&#8208;based route, which requires high annealing temperatures of over 275&#8451;&#160;to in&#8208;situ convert the precursors into oxide films. Such high processing temperatures of NiO  x  HILs hinder their applications in flexible devices. Herein, we report a low&#8208;temperature approach based on Cu&#8208;modified NiO  x  (NiO  x  &#8208;Cu) nanocrystals to prepare HILs. A simple post&#8208;synthetic surface&#8208;modification step, which anchors the copper agents onto the surfaces of oxide nanocrystals, is developed to improve the electrical conductivity of the low&#8208;temperature&#8208;processed (135&#8451;) oxide&#8208;nanocrystal thin films. In consequence, QLEDs based on the NiO  x  &#8208;Cu HILs exhibit an external quantum efficiency of 17.5% and a T  95  operational lifetime of ~2,800 hours at an initial brightness of 1,000 cd m  &#8722;2  , meeting the commercialization requirements for display applications. The results shed light on the potential of using NiO  x  &#8208;Cu HILs for realizing high&#8208;performance flexible QLEDs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>TAMOF&#8208;1  , a homochiral metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) constructed from an amino acid derivative and Cu(II), was investigated as a heterogeneous catalyst in kinetic resolutions involving the ring opening of styrene oxide with a set of anilines. The branched products generated from the ring opening of styrene oxide with anilines and the unreacted epoxide were obtained with moderately high enantiomeric excesses. The linear product arising from the attack on the non&#8208;benzylic position of styrene oxide underwent a second kinetic resolution by reacting with the epoxide, resulting in an amplification of its final enantiomeric excess and a concomitant formation of an array of isomeric aminodiols. Computational studies confirmed the experimental results, providing a deep understanding of the whole process involving the two successive kinetic resolutions. Furthermore,  TAMOF&#8208;1  activity was conserved after several catalytic cycles. The ring opening of a  meso  &#8208;epoxide with aniline catalyzed by  TAMOF&#8208;1  was also studied and moderate enantioselectivities were obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>Host&#8208;guest Interaction in Ethylene and Ethane Separation on Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks as Revealed by Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The separation of ethane/ethylene mixture using MOFs as adsorbents is strongly associated with the pore size&#8208;sieving effect and the adsorbent&#8208;adsorbate interaction. Herein, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy is utilized to explore the host&#8208;guest interaction and ethane/ethylene separation mechanism on zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs). Preferential access to the ZIF&#8208;8 and ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;90 frameworks by ethane compared to ethylene is directly visualized from two&#8208;dimensional 1 H&#8208; 1 H spin diffusion MAS NMR spectroscopy and further verified by computational density distributions. The 1 H MAS NMR spectroscopy provides an alternative for straightforwardly extracting the adsorption selectivity of ethane/ethylene mixture at 1.1~9.6 bar in ZIFs, which is consistent with the IAST predictions.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Coupling of Polyfluorinated Arenes and Functionalized, Masked Aryl Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluoride&#8208;promoted, stepwise nucleophilic aromatic substitution of silicon&#8208;based aryl pronucleophiles decorated with sensitive functional groups and polyfluorinated arenes enables the synthesis of partially fluorinated biaryls. The mild transformation operates at room temperature, requiring less than one hour for completion. Hence, the functional&#8208;group compatibility is superb, and regioselectivities are improved compared to known couplings.







Abstract
A chemoselective C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2) coupling of sufficiently electron&#8208;deficient fluorinated arenes and functionalized N&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8217;&#8208;silyldiazenes as masked aryl nucleophiles is reported. The fluoride&#8208;promoted transformation involves the in&#8197;situ generation of the aryl nucleophile decorated with various sensitive functional groups followed by a stepwise nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr). These reactions typically proceed at room temperature within minutes. This catalytic process allows for the functionalization of both coupling partners, furnishing highly fluorinated biaryls in good yields.

         <title>A Smart Access to the Dinitramide Anion &#8211; The Use of Dinitraminic Acid for the Preparation of Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Energetic Copper(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dinitramide anion was made accessible for complexation through the use of dinitraminic acid and basic copper(II) carbonate. The in&#8197;situ prepared copper dinitramide was complexed by 13 different highly endothermic tri&#8208; and tetrazole ligands. By the choice of ligand, complexes were obtained that possess thermal stability exceeding 200&#8197;degrees Celsius, one even capable of initiating pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). The examined compounds were successfully ignited in laser experiments, with one complex even detonating.







Abstract
Dinitraminic acid (HN(NO2)2, HDN) was prepared by ion exchange chromatography and acid&#8208;base reaction with basic copper(II) carbonate allowed the in&#8197;situ preparation of copper(II) dinitramide, which was reacted with twelve nitrogen&#8208;rich ligands, for example, 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole, 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;5H&#8208;tetrazole, di(5H&#8208;tetrazolyl)&#8208;methane/&#8208;ethane/&#8208;propane/&#8208;butane. Nine of the complexes were investigated by low&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray diffraction. In addition, all compounds were investigated by infrared spectroscopy (IR), differential thermal analysis (DTA), elemental analysis (EA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) for selected compounds. Furthermore, investigations of the materials were carried out regarding their sensitivity toward impact (IS), friction (FS), ball drop impact (BDIS) and electrostatic discharge (ESD). In addition, hot plate and hot needle tests were performed. Complex [Cu(AMT)4(H2O)](DN)2, based on 1&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;methyltetrazole (AMT), is most outstanding for its detonative behavior and thus also capable of initiating PETN in classical initiation experiments. Laser ignition experiments at a wavelength of 915&#8197;nm were performed for all substances and solid&#8208;state UV&#8208;Vis spectra were recorded to apprehend the ignition mechanism.

         <title>Extended Enolates: Versatile Intermediates for Asymmetric C&#8208;H Functionalization via Noncovalent Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extend and divert. Extended enolates may be generated by deprotonation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208; or &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds smoothly, to react with a variety of electrophiles in&#8197;situ. Easier to form than the parent simple enolates, di&#8208; and trienolates present, however, two nucleophilic carbons (typically C&#945; and C&#947;) potentially leading to regioisomeric products. In recent years, methods based on both metallic and organic chiral catalysts have been developed able to address some of these site&#8208; and stereoselectivity issues, enabling direct asymmetric C&#8722;H functionalization of carbonyl compounds.







Abstract
Catalyst&#8208;controlled functionalization of unmodified carbonyl compounds is a relevant operation in organic synthesis, especially when high levels of site&#8208; and stereoselectivity can be attained. This objective is now within reach for some subsets of enolizable substrates using various types of activation mechanisms. Recent contributions to this area include enantioselective transformations that proceed via transiently generated noncovalent di(tri)enolate&#8208;catalyst coordination species. While relatively easier to form than simple enolate congeners, di(tri)enolates are ambifunctional in nature and so control of the reaction regioselectivity becomes an issue. This Minireview discusses in some detail this and other problems, and how noncovalent activation approaches based on metallic and metal free catalysts have been developed to advance the field.

         <title>Rb[Li5Si2O7] &#8208; A Latecomer in the Family of Alkali Lithosilicates Hiding a Green&#8208;Emitting Lithosilicate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In order to expand the field of alkali lithosilicates, a new representative of the substance class with a previously unknown structure type was found based on solid&#8208;state synthesis. The novel compound with the sum formula Rb[Li  5  Si  2  O  7  ] crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group  Pbcm  (no. 57) with  a  = 7.6269(3),  b  = 9.5415(4), and  c  = 9.4095(3) &#197; by means of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The structure consists of a highly condensed lithosilicate framework, built up of corner&#8208; and edge&#8208;linked [LiO  4  ]&#8208;tetrahedra and [Si  2  O  7  ]&#8208;units, and the rubidium ions aligned in channels. Suitable crystals of the material were obtained using sealed tantalum ampoules as reaction tube at a temperature of 750 &#176;C. The new compound was further characterized via powder diffraction, Rietveld analysis, and EDX measurements. At first glance, Eu  2+  &#8208;doped Rb[Li  5  Si  2  O  7  ] reveals an intense green luminescence. In&#8208;depth crystal analysis shows that a core&#8208;shell formation is present even for apparently high quality single&#8208;crystals. As a minority phase, the known green phosphor RbLi[Li  3  SiO  4  ]  2  :Eu  2+  is the origin of the luminescence, representing a tiny core inside of the particles surrounded by a large matrix of transparent Rb[Li  5  Si  2  O  7  ] dominating the single&#8208;crystal diffraction pattern.</dc:description>

The novel compound with the sum formula Rb[Li  5  Si  2  O  7  ] crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group  Pbcm  (no. 57) with  a  = 7.6269(3),  b  = 9.5415(4), and  c  = 9.4095(3) &#197; by means of single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The structure consists of a highly condensed lithosilicate framework, built up of corner- and edge-linked [LiO  4  ]-tetrahedra and [Si  2  O  7  ]-units, and the rubidium ions aligned in channels. Suitable crystals of the material were obtained using sealed tantalum ampoules as reaction tube at a temperature of 750 &#176;C. The new compound was further characterized via powder diffraction, Rietveld analysis, and EDX measurements. At first glance, Eu  2+  -doped Rb[Li  5  Si  2  O  7  ] reveals an intense green luminescence. In-depth crystal analysis shows that a core-shell formation is present even for apparently high quality single-crystals. As a minority phase, the known green phosphor RbLi[Li  3  SiO  4  ]  2  :Eu  2+  is the origin of the luminescence, representing a tiny core inside of the particles surrounded by a large matrix of transparent Rb[Li  5  Si  2  O  7  ] dominating the single-crystal diffraction pattern.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>The Pd&#8208;catalyzed carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation pioneered by Heck in 1969 has dominated medicinal chemistry development for the ensuing fifty years. As the demand for more complex three&#8208;dimensional active pharmaceuticals continues to increase, preparative enzyme&#8208;mediated assembly, by virtue of its exquisite selectivity and sustainable nature, is poised to provide a practical and affordable alternative for accessing such compounds. In this minireview, we summarize recent state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments in practical enzyme&#8208;mediated assembly of carbocycles. When appropriate, background information on the enzymatic transformation is provided and challenges and/or limitations are also highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Molten Salt Assisted Annealing for Making Colloidal ZnGa2O4:Cr Nanocrystals with High Persistent Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Persistent luminescent nanocrystals (PLNCs) in sub&#8208;10 nm domain are considered most fascinating inventions in lighting technology owing to their excellent performance in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, luminous paints, bioimaging, security applications, etc.  Further improvement of persistent luminescence (PersL) intensity and lifetime is needed to achieve the desired success while keeping uniform sub&#8208;10 nm size of PLNCs.  In this work, we have introduced the concept of molten salt confinement to thermally anneal as&#8208;synthesized ZnGa  2  O  4  :Cr  3+  (ZGOC) colloidal NCs (CNCs) in a molten salt media at 650  o  C for the first time. This method led to significantly monodispersed and few agglomerated NCs with much improved photoluminescence (PL) and PersL intensity without much size growth of the pristine CNCs. Other strategies, such as: (i) thermal annealing, (ii) overcoating, and (iii) core&#8208;shell strategy, have also been tried to improve PL and PersL but we could not achieve improvement in their PL and PersL simultaneously. Moreover, directly annealing of the CNCs in air without the molten salt assistance could significantly improve both PL and PersL but lead to particle heterogeneity and aggregation, which are highly unsuitable for in vivo imaging. We believe this work provides a novel strategy to design PLNCs with high PL intensity and long PersL duration without losing their nanostructural characteristics, water dispersibility and biocompatibility.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel WS2/Fe0.95S1.05 Hierarchical Nanosphere as a Highly Efficient Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
WS2/Fe0.95S1.05 hierarchical nanospheres were prepared via a one&#8208;pot synthetic route, with great hydrogen evolution reaction activities. The unique plate of WS2 and the complex solid&#8208;phase structure of Fe0.95S1.05 exposes more active sites for the HER reaction, which helps to improve the accessibility and diffusibility of the electrolyte, and hence the WS2/Fe0.95S1.05 hybrid catalysts display favorable catalytic for HER.







Abstract
Fe0.95S1.05 with high reactivity and stability was incorporated into WS2 nanosheets via a one&#8208;step solvothermal method for the first time. The resulted hybrid catalyst has much higher catalytic activity than WS2 and Fe0.95S1.05 alone, and the optimal WS2/Fe0.95S1.05 hybrid catalyst was found by adjusting the feed ratio. The addition of Fe0.95S1.05 was proven to be able to enhance the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of WS2, and vice versa. At the same time, it was found that the catalytic effect of the hybrid catalyst was the best when the feed ratio was W&#8201;:&#8201;Fe=2&#8201;:&#8201;1. In other words, we confirmed that there is a synergistic effect between W&#8208; and Fe&#8208;based sulfide hybrid catalysts, and validated that the reason for the improved HER performance is the strong interaction between the two in the middle sulfur. WS2/Fe0.95S1.05&#8208;2 hybrid catalyst leads to enhanced HER activity, which shows a low overpotential of &#8764;0.172&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, low Tafel slope of &#8764;53.47&#8197;mV/decade. This study supplies innovative synthesis of a highly active WS2/Fe0.95S1.05 hybrid catalyst for HER.

         <title>Stable and Storable N(CF3)2 Transfer Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable storage solutions: Copper(I) and silver(I) complexes with the bis(trifluoromethyl)amido ligand stabilized by pyridine and phosphane ligands have become accessible. These complexes are thermally stable and can be stored under inert conditions; in contrast to the behavior of other metal salts such as M{N(CF3)2} (M=Cu, Ag). The complexes were found to be convenient reagents for nucleophilic substitution and Sandmeyer reactions, thereby providing access to a series of organic substrates with the bis(trifluoromethyl)amino group.







Abstract
Fluorinated groups are essential for drug design, agrochemicals, and materials science. The bis(trifluoromethyl)amino group is an example of a stable group that has a high potential. While the number of molecules containing perfluoroalkyl, perfluoroalkoxy, and other fluorinated groups is steadily increasing, examples with the N(CF3)2 group are rare. One reason is that transfer reagents are scarce and metal&#8208;based storable reagents are unknown. Herein, a set of CuI and AgI bis(trifluoromethyl)amido complexes stabilized by N&#8208; and P&#8208;donor ligands with unprecedented stability are presented. The complexes are stable solids that can even be manipulated in air for a short time. They are bis(trifluoromethyl)amination reagents as shown by nucleophilic substitution and Sandmeyer reactions. In addition to a series of benzylbis(trifluoromethyl)amines, 2&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)amino acetate was obtained, which, upon hydrolysis, gives the fluorinated amino acid N,N&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)glycine.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stable storage solutions&lt;/b&gt;: Copper(I) and silver(I) complexes with the bis(trifluoromethyl)amido ligand stabilized by pyridine and phosphane ligands have become accessible. These complexes are thermally stable and can be stored under inert conditions; in contrast to the behavior of other metal salts such as &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;{N(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;} (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;=Cu, Ag). The complexes were found to be convenient reagents for nucleophilic substitution and Sandmeyer reactions, thereby providing access to a series of organic substrates with the bis(trifluoromethyl)amino group.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluorinated groups are essential for drug design, agrochemicals, and materials science. The bis(trifluoromethyl)amino group is an example of a stable group that has a high potential. While the number of molecules containing perfluoroalkyl, perfluoroalkoxy, and other fluorinated groups is steadily increasing, examples with the N(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group are rare. One reason is that transfer reagents are scarce and metal-based storable reagents are unknown. Herein, a set of Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; and Ag&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; bis(trifluoromethyl)amido complexes stabilized by N- and P-donor ligands with unprecedented stability are presented. The complexes are stable solids that can even be manipulated in air for a short time. They are bis(trifluoromethyl)amination reagents as shown by nucleophilic substitution and Sandmeyer reactions. In addition to a series of benzylbis(trifluoromethyl)amines, 2-bis(trifluoromethyl)amino acetate was obtained, which, upon hydrolysis, gives the fluorinated amino acid &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-bis(trifluoromethyl)glycine.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Catalytic Transfer Deuteration and Hydrodeuteration: Emerging Techniques to Selectively Transform Alkenes and Alkynes to Deuterated Alkanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, catalytic transfer deuteration and hydrodeuteration techniques are emerging as powerful methods for the selective installation of deuterium into small molecules. In this minireview, recent advances for the application of these reactions in the selective deuteration of alkenes and alkynes are discussed.







Abstract
Increasing demand for deuterium&#8208;labeled organic molecules has spurred a renewed interest in selective methods for deuterium installation. Catalytic transfer deuteration and transfer hydrodeuteration are emerging as powerful techniques for the selective incorporation of deuterium into small molecules. These reactions not only obviate the use of D2 gas and pressurized reaction setups but provide new opportunities for selectively installing deuterium into small molecules. Commercial or readily synthesized deuterium donors are typically employed as easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle reagents for transfer deuteration and hydrodeuteration reactions. In this minireview, recent advances in the catalytic transfer deuteration and hydrodeuteration of alkenes and alkynes for the selective synthesis of deuterated alkanes will be discussed.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Polyoxometalate&#8208;Resorcin[4]arene&#8208;Based Inorganic&#8208;Organic Complexes: Metal Ion Effects on the Electrochemical Performance of Lithium Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
New resources from resorcin: Three polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;resorcin[4]arene&#8208;based inorganic&#8211;organic materials (1&#8211;3) with different metal ions have been synthesized. Their composites 1@RGO&#8208;3@RGO were created by anchoring 1&#8211;3 on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) to enhance the conductivities. These composites show different electrochemical performances for lithium ion batteries.







Abstract
With their adjustable structures and diverse functions, polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;resorcin[4]arene&#8208;based inorganic&#8211;organic complexes are a kind of potential multifunctional material. They have potential applications for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). However, the relationship between different coordinated metal ions and electrochemical performance has rarely been investigated. Here, three functionalized POM&#8208;resorcin[4]arene&#8208;based inorganic&#8211;organic materials, [Co2(TMR4&#8197;A)2(H2O)10][SiW12O40]&#8901;2&#8201;EtOH&#8901;4.5&#8201;H2O (1), [Ni2(TMR4&#8197;A)2(H2O)10][SiW12O40]&#8901;4&#8201;EtOH&#8901;13&#8201;H2O (2), and [Zn2(TMR4&#8197;A)2(H2O)10][SiW12O40]&#8901;2&#8201;EtOH&#8901;2&#8201;H2O (3), have been synthesized. Furthermore, to enhance the conductivities of these compounds, 1&#8211;3 were doped with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) to give composites 1@RGO&#8208;3@RGO, respectively. As anode materials for LIBs, 1@RGO&#8208;3@RGO can deliver very high discharge capacities (1445.9, 1285.0 and 1095.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively) in the initial run, and show discharge capacities of 898, 665 and 651&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively, at a current density of 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 100 runs. More importantly, the discharge capacities of 319, 283 and 329&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 were maintained for 1@RGO&#8208;3@RGO even after 400 cycles at large current density (1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1).

         <title>Spotlight on the Effect of Electrolyte Composition on the Potential of Maximum Entropy: Supporting Electrolytes Are Not Always Inert</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold standards: By determining the potential of maximum entropy (PME) with the laser&#8208;induced current transient technique, the influence of the electrolyte composition on polycrystalline gold has been systematically investigated. Increasing the electrolyte pH and purging O2 shift the PME to more positive potentials. The electric double&#8208;layer structure for Aupc in solutions containing Na+ and K+ ions is vastly different when electrolyte pH reaches six or higher. This method enables another approach for the interpretation of interfacial electrocatalytic processes.







Abstract
The influence of electrolyte pH, the presence of alkali metal cations (Na+, K+), and the presence of O2 on the interfacial water structure of polycrystalline gold electrodes has been experimentally studied in detail. The potential of maximum entropy (PME) was determined by the laser&#8208;induced current transient (LICT) technique. Our results demonstrate that increasing the electrolyte pH and introducing O2 shift the PME to more positive potentials. Interestingly, the PME exhibits a higher sensitivity to the pH change in the presence of K+ than Na+. Altering the pH of the K2SO4 solution from 4 to 6 can cause a drastic shift in the PME. These findings reveal that, for example, K2SO4 and Na2SO4 cannot be considered as equal supporting electrolytes: it is not a viable assumption. This can likely be extrapolated to other common &#8220;inert&#8221; supporting electrolytes. Beyond this, knowledge about the near&#8208;ideal electrolyte composition can be used to optimize electrochemical devices such as electrolyzers, fuel cells, batteries, and supercapacitors.

         <title>Competing Effects of Chlorination on the Strength of Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O Chalcogen Bonds Select the Structure of Mixed Supramolecular Macrocyclic Aggregates of Iso&#8208;Tellurazole N&#8208;Oxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chlorination of tellurium has opposing effects on the formation of chalcogen bonds (ChBs) by iso&#8208;tellurazole N&#8208;oxides, enhancing their strength as ChB donors but weakening their role as ChB acceptors. The net effect is that the fully chlorinated tetramer is barely more stable than the non&#8208;halogenated macrocycle. In contrast, partial halogenation results in a more stable alternating structure.







Abstract
Chlorination of 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;tellurazole&#8208;2&#8208;oxide yielded the &#955;4Te dichloro derivative. Its crystal structure demonstrates that the heterocycle retains its ability to autoassociate by chalcogen bonding (ChB) forming macrocyclic tetramers.

     alt="Competing Effects of Chlorination on the Strength of Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O Chalcogen Bonds Select the Structure of Mixed Supramolecular Macrocyclic Aggregates of Iso-Tellurazole N-Oxides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chlorination of tellurium&lt;/b&gt; has opposing effects on the formation of chalcogen bonds (ChBs) by iso-tellurazole &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxides, enhancing their strength as ChB donors but weakening their role as ChB acceptors. The net effect is that the fully chlorinated tetramer is barely more stable than the non-halogenated macrocycle. In contrast, partial halogenation results in a more stable alternating structure.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chlorination of 3-methyl-5-phenyl-1,2-tellurazole-2-oxide yielded the &#955;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;Te dichloro derivative. Its crystal structure demonstrates that the heterocycle retains its ability to autoassociate by chalcogen bonding (ChB) forming macrocyclic tetramers. The corresponding Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O ChB distances are 2.062&#8197;&#197;, the shortest observed to date in aggregates of this type. DFT&#8722;D3 calculations indicate that while the halogenated molecule is stronger as a ChB donor it also is a weaker ChB acceptor; the overall effect is that the ChBs in the chlorinated homotetramer are not significantly stronger. However, partial halogenation or scrambling selectively yield the 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 heterotetramer with alternating &#955;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;Te and &#955;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Te centers, which calculations identified as the thermodynamically preferred arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>(Automated) Synthesis of Well&#8208;defined Staphylococcus Aureus Wall Teichoic Acid Fragments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using tailor&#8208;made teichoic acid building blocks, a library of glycosylated ribitol phosphate Staphylococcus aureus wall teichoic acids (WTA) has been assembled, ranging in length, and varying in N&#8208;acetyl glucosamine substitution pattern. The library of well&#8208;defined WTAs has been used to develop a magnetic bead binding assay to interrogate monoclonal antibody binding, revealing the preference of the various antibodies for different glycosylation patterns.







Abstract
Wall teichoic acids (WTAs) are important components of the cell wall of the opportunistic Gram&#8208;positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. WTAs are composed of repeating ribitol phosphate (RboP) residues that are decorated with d&#8208;alanine and N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;d&#8208;glucosamine (GlcNAc) modifications, in a seemingly random manner. These WTA&#8208;modifications play an important role in shaping the interactions of WTA with the host immune system. Due to the structural heterogeneity of WTAs, it is impossible to isolate pure and well&#8208;defined WTA molecules from bacterial sources. Therefore, here synthetic chemistry to assemble a broad library of WTA&#8208;fragments, incorporating all possible glycosylation modifications (&#945;&#8208;GlcNAc at the RboP C4; &#946;&#8208;GlcNAc at the RboP C4; &#946;&#8208;GlcNAc at the RboP C3) described for S. aureus WTAs, is reported. DNA&#8208;type chemistry, employing ribitol phosphoramidite building blocks, protected with a dimethoxy trityl group, was used to efficiently generate a library of WTA&#8208;hexamers. Automated solid phase syntheses were used to assemble a WTA&#8208;dodecamer and glycosylated WTA&#8208;hexamer. The synthetic fragments have been fully characterized and diagnostic signals were identified to discriminate the different glycosylation patterns. The different glycosylated WTA&#8208;fragments were used to probe binding of monoclonal antibodies using WTA&#8208;functionalized magnetic beads, revealing the binding specificity of these WTA&#8208;specific antibodies and the importance of the specific location of the GlcNAc modifications on the WTA&#8208;chains.

         <title>Easily Available, Amphiphilic Diiron Cyclopentadienyl Complexes Exhibit in Vitro Anticancer Activity in 2D and 3D Human Cancer Cells through Redox Modulation Triggered by CO Release</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of cationic diiron complexes containing a variable bridging iminium ligand displays promising antiproliferative activity towards a panel of 2D and 3D cancer cell lines, and a selectivity not correlated to a different degree of uptake in cancerous and noncancerous cells. The mode of action appears to be mainly related to the interference with cell redox processes (ROS production, inhibition of TrxR), initiated by intracellular CO release.







Abstract
A straightforward two&#8208;step procedure via single CO removal allows the conversion of commercial [Fe2Cp2(CO)4] into a range of amphiphilic and robust ionic complexes based on a hybrid aminocarbyne/iminium ligand, [Fe2Cp2(CO)3{CN(R)(R&#8217;)}]X (R, R&#8217;=alkyl or aryl; X=CF3SO3 or BF4), on up to multigram scales. Their physicochemical properties can be modulated by an appropriate choice of N&#8208;substituents and counteranion. Tested against a panel of human cancer cell lines, the complexes were shown to possess promising antiproliferative activity and to circumvent multidrug resistance. Interestingly, most derivatives also retained a significant cytotoxic activity against human cancer 3D cell cultures. Among them, the complex with R=4&#8208;C6H4OMe and R&#8217;=Me emerged as the best performer of the series, being on average about six times more active against cancer cells than a noncancerous cell line, and displayed IC50 values comparable to those of cisplatin in 3D cell cultures. Mechanistic studies revealed the ability of the complexes to release carbon monoxide and to act as oxidative stress inducers in cancer cells.

         <title>Synthesis of Difluoroglycine Derivatives from Amines, Difluorocarbene, and CO2: Computational Design, Scope, and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Artificial Force Induced Reaction (AFIR) on a super computer has led to a new three&#8208;component reaction (3CR) of amines, difluorocarbene, and the inexpensive and non&#8208;toxic C1 source CO2. This reaction produces a broad range of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroglycine derivatives that are bioisosteres of natural glycine. The versatility of these products is very broad; i.e., they can be used as new difluorocarbene sources, substrates for radical substitution reactions, and precursors for new NHC ligands. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Maeda, T. Mita et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100812).

The emission color is changed by absorption of solvent vapor, such as dichloromethane and recovered by desorption of encapsulated molecules through fuming with another solvent vapor, such as cyclohexane. The alteration of molecular conformation between planar and twisted structures is responsible for luminochromism. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Tanaka et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101107).

         <title>First Total Synthesis of Phytoprostanes with Prostaglandin&#8208;Like Configuration, Evidence for Their Formation in Edible Vegetable Oils and Orienting Study of Their Biological Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phytoglandins from the reaction flask enable their identification in Nature. Hypothetical plant&#8208;based prostaglandin analogs were obtained by a 15&#8208;step asymmetric total synthesis. They were applied as an analytical standard in a detailed LC&#8208;MS/MS study confirming phytoglandin formation in autoxidized linolenic acid and in various edible vegetable oils in sizeable quantities. More information can be found in the Full Paper by U. Jahn et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100872).

         <title>A Nazarov&#8208;Ene Tandem Reaction for the Stereoselective Construction of Spiro Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem Nazarov/ene reaction in trienones was found to be initiated by tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (TPPB) and resulted in spiro compounds as single diastereoisomers. The reaction was applied to a set of substrates with different chain lengths and functionalities, and investigations on the mechanism were conducted. This novel diastereoselective reaction extends the application of interrupted Nazarov cyclizations as tools for the synthesis of natural products. More information can be found in the Communication by M. Kalesse et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101041).

         <title>Exploiting Transient Radical Cations as Br&#248;nsted Acids for Allylic C&#8211;H Heteroarylation of Enol Silyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction pathways of transient radical species are difficult to control, like the soap bubbles in the wind depicted in the cover image. Yet, these short&#8208;lived intermediates, when one encounters another, readily assemble into a united structure, as two bubbles fuse into a bigger single bubble. The enol silyl ether&#8208;derived radical cations with a highly acidic allylic proton facilitates the single&#8208;electron reduction of cyanopyridines via protonation. The resulting two radical intermediates successively engage in the radical&#8722;radical coupling to produce heteroarylated enol silyl ethers. More information can be found in the Communication by T. Ooi et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101352).

         <title>Photoresponsive Binding Dynamics in High&#8208;Affinity Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;Dithienylethene Host&#8208;Guest Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoresponsive binding kinetics was achieved in cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;dithienylethene host&#8208;guest complexes. This work demonstrates that, in the presence of a competitor guest (in purple), the host&#8208;guest dissociation kinetics is approximately 100&#8208;fold slower for the closed (green) than for the open (yellow) dithienylethene isomers (t 1/2=107 hours vs. t 1/2=1.2 hours), allowing control over the dissociation rate with red/NIR light. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A. Jorge&#8197;Parola, N. Bas&#237;lio, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100974).

         <title>Modulation of Src Kinase Activity by Selective Substrate Recognition with Pseudopeptidic Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modulation of the activity of tyrosine kinases (TK) is an appealing topic of current research. This work presents new pseudopeptidic cages that protect the substrates from the action of the TK enzyme, precluding the corresponding Tyr phosphorylation, with a very good correlation between the Tyr caging and the kinase inhibition. The results illustrate how TK signaling can be efficiently and selectively modulated with supramolecular complexes. More information can be found in the Full Paper by W.&#8197;T. Miller, I. Alfonso, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100990).

         <title>Iminosugar&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides work as pharmacological chaperones of NAGLU, a glycosidase involved in MPS IIIB rare disease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB is a devastating neurological disease caused by a lack of the lysosomal enzyme,&#160; &#945; &#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU), leading to a toxic accumulation of heparan sulfate. Herein we explored a pharmacological chaperone approach to enhance the residual activity of NAGLU in patient fibroblasts. Capitalizing on the three&#8208;dimensional structures of two modest homoiminosugar&#8208;based NAGLU inhibitors in complex with bacterial homolog of NAGLU, CpGH89, we have synthesized a library of 17 six&#8208;membered iminosugar&#8208;  C  &#8208;glycosides mimicking&#160;  N  &#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine and bearing various pseudo&#8208;anomeric substituents of both&#160; &#945; &#8208; and&#160; &#946; &#8208;configuration. Elaboration with the aglycon moiety results in low micromolar selective inhibitors of human recombinant NAGLU, but surprisingly it is the non&#8208;functionalized and wrongly configured&#160; &#946; &#8208;homoiminosugar that was proved to act as the most promising pharmacological chaperone, promoting a 2.4 fold activity enhancement of mutant NAGLU at its optimal concentration</dc:description>

         <title>A Novel Reactivity of Phosphanylalumane (&gt;P&#8211;Al&lt;): Reversible Addition of a Saturated Interelement Bond to Olefins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reversible addition reactions of olefins with a phosphanylalumane, P&#8211;Al single bond species, were investigated. The P&#8211;Al bond added to ethylene and relatively small terminal alkenes (propylene and hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene) at room temperature to give the corresponding alkene&#8208;adducts. Heating of the terminal alkene&#8208;adducts released the corresponding alkenes and regenerated the P&#8211;Al bond, but no release of ethylene was observed even under vacuum conditions. The reactivity of ethylene&#8208;adduct as a new saturated C2&#8208;vicinal P/Al&#8208;based FLP was also investigated. The ethylene&#8208;adduct was found to undergo complexation with nitriles to give the corresponding nitrile adducts to the Al center, which retained the ethylene&#8208;tether as in the case of the corresponding P/B&#8208;based FLP. However, the reactivity of ethylene&#8208;adduct toward CO2 and benzaldehyde differed from that of the P/B&#8208;system giving the corresponding adducts.</dc:description>

         <title>Competitive Coordination of Chloride and Fluoride Anions Towards Trivalent Lanthanide Cations (La3+ and Nd3+) in Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molten salt electrolysis is a vital technique to produce high&#8208;purity lanthanide metals and alloys. However, the coordination environments of lanthanides in molten salts, which heavily affect the related redox potential and electrochemical properties, have not been well elucidated. Here we explore the      competitive coordination of chloride and fluoride anions towards lanthanide cations (La  3+  and Nd  3+  )     in    molten  LiCl&#8208;KCl&#8208;LiF&#8208;LnCl  3  salts   by using electrochemical,  spectroscopic  , and computational approaches. Electrochemical analyses show that significant negative shifts in the reduction potential of Ln  3+  occur when F  &#8208;  concentration increases, indicating that the F  &#8208;  anions interact with Ln  3+  via substituting the coordinated Cl  &#8208;  anions, and confirm [LnCl  x  F  y  ]  3&#8208;x&#8208;y  (y  max  =3) complexes are prevailing in molten salts.  Spectroscopic and computational results on solution structures further reveal the competition between Cl  &#8208;  and F  &#8208;  anions, which leads to the formation of  four distinct Ln(III) species: [LnCl  6  ]  3&#8208;  ,  [LnCl  5  F]  3&#8208;  , [LnCl  4  F  2  ]  3&#8208;  and [LnCl  4  F  3  ]  4&#8208;  . Among them, the seven&#8208;coordinated [LnCl  4  F  3  ]  4&#8208;  complex possesses a low&#8208;symmetry structure evidenced by the pattern change of Raman spectra. After comparing the polarizing power (Z/r) among different metal cations, we conclude that Ln&#8208;F interaction is weaker than that between transition metal and F  &#8208;  ions.</dc:description>

         <title>Evolution of a Strategy for the Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Cornexistin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a full account on the evolution of the first total synthesis of (+)&#8208;cornexistin. Our initial efforts were based on masking the reactive maleic anhydride moiety as a 3,4&#8208;substituted furan and on forming the nine&#8208;membered carbocycle via an intramolecular Conia&#8208;ene or&#160; Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) reaction. Those strategies suffered from low yields and were jeopardized by a late&#8208;stage installation of the&#160;  Z  &#8208;alkene, as well as the stereocenters along the eastern periphery. We addressed those issues by employing a chiral&#8208;pool strategy that involved construction of the crucial stereocenters at C2, C3 and C8 at an early stage with installation of the maleic anhydride as late as possible. The successful approach featured an intermolecular NHK coupling to install the&#160;  Z  &#8209;alkene, a&#160;  syn  &#8208;Evans&#8208;aldol reaction to forge the stereocenters along the eastern periphery, an intramolecular allylic alkylation to close the nine&#8208;membered carbocycle and a challenging stepwise hydrolysis of a&#160; &#946; &#8208;keto nitrile to furnish the maleic anhydride.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the &#960;&#8208;Accepting Properties of Mesoionic Carbenes: A Combined Computational and Experimental Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mesoionic imidazolylidenes are recognized as excellent electron&#8208;donating ligands in organometallic and main group chemistry. However, these carbene ligands typically show poor &#960;&#8208;accepting properties. We have performed a computational analysis of 71 mesoionic imidazolylidenes having different aryl or heteroaryl substituents in C2 position. The study has revealed that a diphenyltriazinyl (Dpt) substituent renders the corresponding carbene particularly &#960;&#8208;acidic. The computational results could be corroborated experimentally. A mesoionic imidazolylidene with a Dpt substituent was found to be a better &#963;&#8208;donor and a better &#960;&#8208;acceptor compared to an Arduengo&#8208;type N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene. To demonstrate the utility of the new carbene, we have used the ligand to stabilize a low&#8208;valent paramagnetic tin(II) compound.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Stiffening and Non&#8208;Cell Adhesive Properties of Amphiphilic Peptides with Central Alkylene Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fiber&#8208;forming peptides are of high interest for potential biomedical applications. This work presents the unexpected effects of central alkylene chains in peptides on their self&#8208;assembly and biological properties. Insertion of the alkylene chain at the center of the peptide allowed for strengthening of &#946;&#8208;sheet hydrogen bonds, formation of hydrogels with increased stiffness, thermal responses and significant decrease in the cell adhesive property. This study offers a novel molecular design to tune mechanical and biological properties of peptide materials by conformational flexibility.

         <title>Re&#8208;entrant Photoinduced Morphological Transformation and Temperature&#8208;Dependent Kinetic Products of a Rectangular Amphiphilic Diarylethene Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different temperature, different assembly: An amphiphilic rectangular&#8208;shaped photochromic diarylethene showed photoinduced morphological transformation upon irradiation with UV and visible light in water. A re&#8208;entrant transformation was observed, which was interpreted by the V&#8208;shaped phase diagram of the LCST transition. Moreover, by changing the cooling temperature, different kinetic products of supramolecular assembly were obtained.







Abstract
An amphiphilic rectangular&#8208;shaped photochromic diarylethene bearing two hydrophobic alkyl chains and two hydrophilic tri(ethylene glycol) chains was synthesized, and its photoinduced morphological transformation in water was investigated. Two unexpected phenomena were revealed in the course of the experiments: a re&#8208;entrant photoinduced macroscopic morphological transformation and temperature&#8208;dependent kinetic products of supramolecular assembly. When the pure closed&#8208;ring isomer was dispersed in water, a re&#8208;entrant photoinduced morphological transformation, that is, a photoinduced transition from the hydrated phase to the dehydrated phase and then back to the hydrated phase, was observed by optical microscopy upon irradiation with green light at 20&#8201;&#176;C; this was interpreted by the V&#8208;shaped phase diagram of the LCST transition. The aqueous assembly of the pure closed&#8208;ring isomer was controlled by changing the temperature; specifically, rapid cooling to 15 and 5&#8201;&#176;C gave J and H aggregates, respectively, as the kinetic products. The thermodynamic product at both temperatures was a mixture of mostly H aggregate with a small amount of J aggregate. This behavior was rationalized by the temperature&#8208;dependent potential energy surface of the supramolecular assembly.

         <title>Comparative Investigation into the Complexation and Extraction Properties of Tridentate and Tetradentate Phosphine Oxide&#8208;Functionalized 1,10&#8208;Phenanthroline Ligands toward Lanthanides and Actinides</title>

The same, but different: Two phosphine oxide&#8208;functionalized 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligands, the tetradentate 2,9&#8208;bis(butylphenylphosphine oxide)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (L1) and tridentate 2&#8208;(butylphenylphosphine oxide)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (L2), have been synthesized and studied comparatively for coordination and extraction with trivalent actinides and lanthanides. Although quite different extraction properties toward AmIII and EuIII were found between L1 and L2 due to their different hydrophobicity in nitrate media, they showed comparable affinity to trivalent f&#8208;block elements, as revealed by UV/vis titration, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and DFT calculation.







Abstract
Two new phosphine oxide&#8208;functionalized 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligands, tetradentate 2,9&#8208;bis(butylphenylphosphine oxide)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (BuPh&#8208;BPPhen, L1) and tridentate 2&#8208;(butylphenylphosphine oxide)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (BuPh&#8208;MPPhen, L2), were synthesized and studied comparatively for their coordination with trivalent actinides and lanthanides. The complexation mechanisms of these two ligands toward trivalent f&#8208;block elements were thoroughly elucidated by NMR spectroscopy, UV/vis spectrophotometry, fluorescence spectrometry, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, solvent extraction, and theoretical calculation methods. NMR titration results demonstrated that 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 (metal to ligand) lanthanides complexes formed for L1, whereas 1&#8201;:&#8201;1, 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 and 1&#8201;:&#8201;3 lanthanide complexes formed for L2 in methanol. The formation of these species was validated by fluorescence spectrometry, and the corresponding stability constants for the complexes of NdIII with L1 and L2 were determined by using UV/vis spectrophotometry. Structures of the 10&#8208;coordinated 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;type complexes of EuL1(NO3)3 and [EuL2(NO3)3(H2O)] Et2O in the solid state were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. In solvent&#8208;extraction experiments, L1 exhibited extremely strong extraction ability for both AmIII and EuIII, whereas L2 showed nearly no extraction toward AmIII or EuIII due to its high hydrophilicity. Finally, the structures and bonding natures of the complex species formed between AmIII/EuIII and L1/L2 were analyzed in DFT calculations.

         <title>Cu/CuxS&#8208;Embedded N,S&#8208;Doped Porous Carbon Derived in Situ from a MOF Designed for Efficient Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Greater than the sum of its parts: Cu/CuxS embedded N,S&#8208;doped porous carbon (Cu/CuxS/NSC) derived in&#8197;situ from a designed Cu&#8208;MOF was successfully synthesized. Porous Cu/CuxS/NSC has a high catalytic reduction efficiency for 4&#8208;NP (k=0.0256&#8197;s&#8722;1) and dyes (CR, MO, MB and RhB) that is better than that of many copper&#8208;based catalysts and even precious metal catalysts. The efficient catalytic reduction performance of Cu/CuxS/NSC is inseparable from the synergistic catalysis of each component.







Abstract
The reasonable design of the precursor of a carbon&#8208;based nanocatalyst is an important pathway to improve catalytic performance. In this study, a simple solvothermal method was used to synthesize [Cu(TPT)(2,5&#8208;tdc)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O (Cu&#8208;MOF), which contains N and S atoms, in one step. Further in&#8208;situ carbonization of the Cu&#8208;MOF as the precursor was used to synthesize Cu/CuxS&#8208;embedded N,S&#8208;doped porous carbon (Cu/CuxS/NSC) composites. The catalytic activities of the prepared Cu/CuxS/NSC were investigated through catalytic reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol (4&#8208;NP) to 4&#8208;aminophenol (4&#8208;AP). The results show that the designed Cu/CuxS/NSC has exceptional catalytic activity and recycling stability, with a reaction rate constant of 0.0256&#8197;s&#8722;1, and the conversion rate still exceeds 90&#8201;% after 15 cycles. Meanwhile, the efficient catalytic reduction of dyes (CR, MO, MB and RhB) confirmed its versatility. Finally, the active sites of the Cu/CuxS/NSC catalysts were analyzed, and a possible multicomponent synergistic catalytic mechanism was proposed.

&lt;/sub&gt;S/NSC has a high catalytic reduction efficiency for 4-NP (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;=0.0256&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and dyes (CR, MO, MB and RhB) that is better than that of many copper-based catalysts and even precious metal catalysts. The efficient catalytic reduction performance of Cu/Cu&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;S/NSC is inseparable from the synergistic catalysis of each component.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasonable design of the precursor of a carbon-based nanocatalyst is an important pathway to improve catalytic performance. In this study, a simple solvothermal method was used to synthesize [Cu(TPT)(2,5-tdc)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (Cu-MOF), which contains N and S atoms, in one step. Further in-situ carbonization of the Cu-MOF as the precursor was used to synthesize Cu/Cu&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;S-embedded N,S-doped porous carbon (Cu/Cu&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;S/NSC) composites. The catalytic activities of the prepared Cu/Cu&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;S/NSC were investigated through catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) to 4-aminophenol (4-AP). The results show that the designed Cu/Cu&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;S/NSC has exceptional catalytic activity and recycling stability, with a reaction rate constant of 0.0256&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and the conversion rate still exceeds 90&#8201;% after 15 cycles. Meanwhile, the efficient catalytic reduction of dyes (CR, MO, MB and RhB) confirmed its versatility. Finally, the active sites of the Cu/Cu&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;S/NSC catalysts were analyzed, and a possible multicomponent synergistic catalytic mechanism was proposed.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Proton&#8208;Responsive Pyridyl(benzamide)&#8208;Functionalized NHC Ligand on Ir Complex for Alkylation of Ketones and Secondary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cp*Ir(III) complex bearing a pyridyl(benzamide)&#8208;functionalized N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand exhibits aromatization/dearomatization on protonation/deprotonation. The proton&#8208;responsive unit of the title compound plays a key role in catalysing &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones and &#946;&#8208;alkylation of secondary alcohols using primary alcohols via a borrowing&#8208;hydrogen pathway.







Abstract
A Cp*Ir(III) complex (1) of a newly designed ligand L1 featuring a proton&#8208;responsive pyridyl(benzamide) appended on N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) has been synthesized. The molecular structure of 1 reveals a dearomatized form of the ligand. The protonation of 1 with HBF4 in tetrahydrofuran gives the corresponding aromatized complex [Cp*Ir(L1H)Cl]BF4 (2). Both compounds are characterized spectroscopically and by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The protonation of 1 with acid is examined by 1H NMR and UV&#8208;vis spectra. The proton&#8208;responsive character of 1 is exploited for catalyzing &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones and &#946;&#8208;alkylation of secondary alcohols using primary alcohols as alkylating agents through hydrogen&#8208;borrowing methodology. Compound 1 is an effective catalyst for these reactions and exhibits a superior activity in comparison to a structurally similar iridium complex [Cp*Ir(L2)Cl]PF6 (3) lacking a proton&#8208;responsive pendant amide moiety. The catalytic alkylation is characterized by a wide substrate scope, low catalyst and base loadings, and a short reaction time. The catalytic efficacy of 1 is also demonstrated for the syntheses of quinoline and lactone derivatives via acceptorless dehydrogenation, and selective alkylation of two steroids, pregnenolone and testosterone. Detailed mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations substantiate the role of the proton&#8208;responsive ligand in the hydrogen&#8208;borrowing process.

         <title>Unbalanced 2D Chiral Crystallization of Pentahelicene Propellers and Their Planarization into Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From helical to planar: Molecular propellers built up by three pentahelicene subunits self&#8208;assemble on a gold surface into enantiomerically unbalanced two&#8208;dimensional crystal domains. Upon thermal treatment of the close&#8208;packed monolayer, intramolecular cyclodehydrogenation into planar nanographenes occurs. Further thermal treatment leads in part to fusion into larger graphene flakes of up to four nanographene units by intermolecular cyclodehydrogenation.







Abstract
The chiral self&#8208;assembly of trispentahelicene propellers on a gold surface has been investigated in ultrahigh vacuum by means of scanning tunneling microscopy and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. The trispentahelicene propellers aggregate into mirror domains with an enantiomeric ratio of 2&#8201;:&#8201;1. Thermally induced cyclodehydrogenation leads to planarization into nanographenes, which self&#8208;assemble into closed&#8208;packed layers with two different azimuths. Further treatment induces in part dimerization and trimerization by intermolecular cyclodehydrogenation.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Chemo&#8208;, Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Reduction of Ketosteroids to Hydroxysteroids over Zr&#8208;Containing MOF&#8208;808 Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>

Zr&#8208;containing MOF&#8208;808&#8201;is a stable and reusable catalyst for the chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and diastereoselective reduction of 17&#8208;ketosteroids to elusive 17&#945;&#8208;hydroxysteroids compounds, as shown for the synthesis of 17&#945;&#8208;estradiol, androstan&#8208;3&#946;,17&#945;&#8208;diol, and epitestosterone. The process was carried out in a single step and without using toxic and/or expensive reagents. Temperature&#8208;dependent kinetic analysis of estrone reduction revealed that the diastereoselectivity to 17&#945;&#8208;estradiol originates from the confinement of the reaction inside the MOF cavities in which the Zr4+ active sites are located.







Abstract
Zr&#8208;containing MOF&#8208;808 is a very promising heterogeneous catalyst for the selective reduction of ketosteroids to the corresponding hydroxysteroids through a Meerwein&#8208;Ponndorf&#8208;Verley (MPV) reaction. Interestingly, the process leads to the diastereoselective synthesis of elusive 17&#945;&#8208;hydroxy derivatives in one step, whereas most chemical and biological transformations produce the 17&#946;&#8208;OH compounds, or they require several additional steps to convert 17&#946;&#8208;OH into 17&#945;&#8208;OH by inverting the configuration of the 17 center. Moreover, MOF&#8208;808 is found to be stable and reusable; it is also chemoselective (only keto groups are reduced, even in the presence of other reducible groups such as C=C bonds) and regioselective (in 3,17&#8208;diketosteroids only the keto group in position 17 is reduced, while the 3&#8208;keto group remains almost intact). The kinetic rate constant and thermodynamic parameters of estrone reduction to estradiol have been obtained by a detailed temperature&#8208;dependent kinetic analysis. The results evidence a major contribution of the entropic term, thus suggesting that the diastereoselectivity of the process is controlled by the confinement of the reaction inside the MOF cavities, where the Zr4+ active sites are located.

Mind the gap! Disabled scientists and students have been severely affected by the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic; this must be urgently addressed to avoid entrenching existing inequalities. The graphical abstract includes a bar chart comparing the % disability declaration statistics for the UK population (&#8764;20% 2015&#8211;16), STEM first degree students (15.5%, 2018&#8211;19), STEM academics (3.8%, 2018&#8211;19), and UKRI grant applicants (&#8764;1%, 2014&#8211;19); and highlights the key recommendations given in the article: meaningful consultation, flexible working policies, disabled staff networks, and allyship.







Abstract
Scientists and students with disabilities have been severely affected by the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, and this must be urgently addressed to avoid further entrenching existing inequalities. The need for rapid decision&#8208;making, often by senior colleagues without lived experience of disabilities, can lead to policies which discriminate against scientists with disabilities.
This article reflects on disability declaration statistics and research in critical disability studies and social science to explore the challenges experienced by disabled scientists before and during the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic and highlights recommendations and examples of good practice to adopt in order to challenge ableism in STEM communities and workplaces. It is vital that disabled staff and students are fully involved in decision making. This is particularly important as we continue to respond to the challenges and opportunities associated with the ongoing COVID&#8208;19 pandemic and plan for a post&#8208;COVID&#8208;19 future.
This time of great change can be used as an opportunity to listen, learn, and improve working conditions and access for scientists with disabilities, and by doing so, for everyone.

         <title>Using Small Molecules to Enhance P450 OleT Enzyme Activity in Situ</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of small molecules was reported to enhance the catalytic efficiency of P450 OleT by interaction with the enzyme active center. The cover shows that the rotation motion of the turbine speeds up with the help of the small person, hinting that the efficiency of the decarboxylation catalyzed by P450 OleT was improved by the small&#8208;molecule&#8208;stimulated enzymatic reactions. More information can be found in the Communication by Y. Yin, Q. Wang, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100680).

         <title>Affinity Selections of DNA&#8208;Encoded Chemical Libraries on Carbonic Anhydrase IX&#8208;Expressing Tumor Cells Reveal a Dependence on Ligand Valence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The screening of a DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library against carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)&#8208;expressing tumor cells is depicted in the cover image. DNA&#8208;encoding techniques allow the construction and screening of chemical libraries of unprecedented size, but these procedures are typically performed using purified protein targets. While the introduction of cell&#8208;based selections expanded the target scope, selection parameters remained obscure. We report systemic optimizations which translated to the successful discovery of CAIX ligands via cell&#8208;based selections. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J. Scheuermann, D. Neri, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100816).

         <title>Switching from Metal&#8208; to Ligand&#8208;Based Oxidation in Cobalt Complexes with Redox&#8208;Active Bisguanidine Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The control of the redox reactivity, magnetic and optical properties of the different redox states of complexes with redox&#8208;active ligands permits their rational use in catalysis and materials science. The redox&#8208;chemistry of octahedrally&#8208;coordinated high&#8208;spin Co  II  complexes (three unpaired electrons) with one redox&#8208;active bisguanidine ligand and two acetylacetonato (acac) co&#8208;ligands is completely changed by replacing the acac by hexafluoro&#8208;acetylacetonato (hfacac) co&#8208;ligands. The first one&#8208;electron oxidation is metal&#8208;centered in the case of the complexes with acac co&#8208;ligands, giving diamagnetic Co  III  complexes. By contrast, in the case of the less Lewis&#8208;basic hfacac co&#8208;ligands, the first one&#8208;electron oxidation becomes ligand&#8208;centered, leading to high&#8208;spin Co  II  complexes with a radical monocationic guanidine ligand unit (four unpaired electrons). Ferromagnetic coupling between the spins on the metal and the organic radical in solution is evidenced by temperature&#8208;dependent paramagnetic NMR studies, allowing to estimate the isotropic exchange coupling constant in solution. Second one&#8208;electron oxidation leads to high&#8208;spin Co  II  complexes with dicationic guanidine ligand units (three unpaired electrons) in the presence of hfacac co&#8208;ligands, but to low&#8208;spin Co  III  complexes with radical monocationic, peralkylated guanidine ligand (one unpaired electron) in the presence of acac co&#8208;ligands. The analysis of the electronic structures is complemented by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations on the spin density distributions and relative energies of the possible redox isomers.</dc:description>

         <title>Tracking Electrocatalytic Activity of a Single Palladium Nanoparticle for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nanoparticle&#8208;based electrocatalysts&#8217; performance is directly related to the working conditions. In general, a number of nanoparticles are uncontrollably fixed on a millimetre&#8208;sized electrode for electrochemical measurements. However, it cannot reveal the maximum electrocatalytic activity owing to the aggregation and detachment of nanoparticles on the electrode surface. To amend this drawback, here, we take the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyzed by palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) as a model system to track the electrocatalytic activity of single Pd NPs by stochastic collision electrochemistry and ensemble electrochemistry, respectively. Comparing with the fix working condition, Pd NPs in the diffusion working condition perform a 2&#8208;5 orders magnitude enhancements of electrocatalytic activity for HER at various biased potential. Stochastic collision electrochemistry with high temporal resolution gives further insights into the accurate study of NPs&#8217; electrocatalytic performance, enabling to dramatically enhance electrocatalytic efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Absorption Properties of Long Acenoacenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acenes, polyaromatic hydrocarbons composed of linearly fused benzene rings have received immense attention due to their performance as semiconductors in organic optoelectronic applications. Their appealing physicochemical properties, such as extended delocalization, high charge carrier mobilities, narrow HOMO&#8208;LOMO gaps and partially radical character in the ground state make them very attractive targets for many potential applications. However, the intrinsic synthetic challenges of unsubstituted members such as high reactivity and poor solubility are still limiting factors for their wider exploitation. Herein, we report a simple general synthesis of a new family of angularly fused acenoacenes with improved stability compared to their isoelectronic linear counterparts. The synthesis and comprehensive characterization of pentacenopentacene, pentacenohexacene and hexacenohexacene, with lengths between decacene and dodecacene, are disclosed.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the Catalytically Active Species in POM&#8208;Catalysed DNA&#8208;Model Hydrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A [Mo7O24]6&#8208; polyanion is used to catalyze the hydrolysis of a phosphoester bond, although the polyanion is not directly responsible for the catalysis. The real catalyst is produced in situ of the reaction media through the decomposition of the initial polyoxometalate leading to the [Mo2O8H4] dimeric species, which is the real catalytic species. Formation in situ of this neutral compound would explain why polyanions may approach the negatively charged environment of the phosphoester bond and produce the catalysis. The lower mass of the real catalytic species suggests a cheaper and greener chemical process. More information can be found in the Full Paper by H.&#8197;N. Miras, N.&#8197;A. Bandeira, A. Gil, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202004989).

         <title>Tune the Fluorescence and Electrochemiluminescence of Graphitic Carbon Nitride Nanosheets by Controlling the Defect States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of defect states on the fluorescence (FL) and electrochemiluminescence (ECL) properties of g&#8208;CN are systematically investigated for the first time. It is found that the luminescence properties of g&#8208;CN are determined by its band gap and two kinds of defects (CN&#8208;defect and C&#8208;defect). The results provide a deep insight into the FL and ECL mechanisms of g&#8208;CN, and are of significance in tuning the FL and ECL properties of g&#8208;CN.







Abstract
The effects of defect states on the fluorescence (FL) and electrochemiluminescence (ECL) properties of graphite phase carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) are systematically investigated for the first time. The g&#8208;CN nanosheets (CNNSs) obtained at different condensation temperatures are used as the study models. It can be found that all the CNNSs have two kinds of defect states, one is originated from the edge of CNNSs (labeled as CN&#8208;defect) and the other is attributed to the partially carbonization regions (labeled as C&#8208;defect). Both two kinds of defect states substantially affect the luminescent properties of CNNSs. Both the FL and ECL signals of CNNSs contain a band gap emission and two defect emissions. For the FL of CNNSs, decreasing the density of defect states can increase efficiently the FL quantum yield, while increasing the density of defect states can make the FL spectra red shift. For the ECL of CNNSs, increasing the density of CN&#8208;defect states and decreasing the density of C&#8208;defect states are greatly important to improve the ECL activity. This work provides a deep insight into the FL and ECL mechanisms of g&#8208;CN, and is of significance in tuning the FL and ECL properties of g&#8208;CN. Also, it will greatly promote the applications of CNNSs based on the FL and ECL properties.

         <title>Towards DNA&#8208;Encoded Micellar Chemistry: DNA&#8208;Micelle Association and Environment Sensitivity of Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It&#8242;s a matter of environment: Copolymer micelles attracted DNA oligonucleotide conjugates in aqueous solution despite lacking canonical DNA&#8208;binding motifs. Following accumulation inside micelles, DNA&#8208;coupled starting materials underwent Povarov and Biginelli reactions to target molecules by a localized sulfonic acid. The kinetics of a given reaction were tuned by the chemical environment within the micelles.







Abstract
The development of DNA&#8208;compatible reaction methodologies is a central theme to advance DNA&#8208;encoded screening library technology. Recently, we were able to show that sulfonic acid&#8208;functionalized block copolymer micelles facilitated Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;promoted reactions such as the Povarov reaction on DNA&#8208;coupled starting materials with minimal DNA degradation. Here, the impact of polymer composition on micelle shape, and reaction conversion was investigated. A dozen sulfonic acid&#8208;functionalized block copolymers of different molar mass and composition were prepared by RAFT polymerization and were tested in the Povarov reaction, removal of the Boc protective group, and the Biginelli reaction. The results showed trends in the polymer structure&#8208;micellar catalytic activity relationship. For instance, micelles composed of block copolymers with shorter acrylate ester chains formed smaller particles and tended to provide faster reaction kinetics. Moreover, fluorescence quenching experiments as well as circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that DNA&#8208;oligomer&#8208;conjugates, although highly water&#8208;soluble, accumulated very effectively in the micellar compartments, which is a prerequisite for carrying out a DNA&#8208;encoded reaction in the presence of polymer micelles.

         <title>Upper Critical Solution Temperature&#8208;Type Responsive Cyclodextrins with Characteristic Inclusion Abilities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclodextrins (CDs) carrying ureido moieties in their peripheries were demonstrated to show unprecedented upper critical solution temperature (UCST) behavior in water, as well as strong inclusion toward guest dyes either below or above their phase transition temperatures. The coacervates of these CD derivatives further co&#8208;encapsulated a pair of guest dyes whose fluorescence resonance energy transfer process can be switched on and off through the phase transitions.







Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble and thermoresponsive macrocycles with stable inclusion toward guests are highly valuable to construct stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular materials for versatile applications. Here, we develop such macrocycles &#8211; ureido&#8208;substituted cyclodextrins (CDs) which exhibit unprecedented upper critical solution temperature (UCST) behavior in aqueous media. These novel CD derivatives showed good solubility in water at elevated temperature, but collapsed from water to form large coacervates upon cooling to low temperature. Their cloud points are greatly dependent on concentration and can be mediated through oxidation and chelation with silver ions. Significantly, the amphiphilicity of these CD derivatives is supportive to host&#8208;guest binding, which affords them inclusion abilities to guest dyes. The inclusion complexation remained nearly intact during thermally induced phase transitions, which is in contrast to the switchable inclusion behavior of lower critical solution temperature (LCST)&#8208;type CDs. Moreover, ureido&#8208;substituted CDs were exploited to co&#8208;encapsulate a pair of guest dyes whose fluorescence resonance energy transfer process can be switched by the UCST phase transition. We therefore believe these novel thermoresponsive CDs may form a new strategy for developing smart macrocycles and allow for exploring smart supramolecular materials.

         <title>Influence of Fine Ligand Substitution Modification of the Isocyanidometal Bridge on Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Charge Transfer Properties in Class II&#8211;III Mixed Valence Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of new heterotrimetallic isocyanidometal&#8208;bridged complexes were synthesized and characterized. The experimental results show that the MMCT energy and the degree of electron delocalization of isocyanidometal&#8208;bridged mixed valence complexes can be tuned systematically by changing the auxiliary ligand on the bridging metal centre. The half&#8208;wave potential splitting between the terminal Fe centres in these three unoxidized complexes are the largest potential splitting for the cyanido&#8208;bridged complexes reported so far.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of Class II&#8211;III mixed valence complexes have been an interesting topic due to their special intermediate behaviour between localized and delocalized mixed valence complexes. To investigate the influence of the isocyanidometal bridge on metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (MMCT) properties, a family of new isocyanidometal&#8208;bridged complexes and their one&#8208;electron oxidation products cis&#8208;[Cp(dppe)Fe&#8722;CN&#8722;Ru(L)2&#8208;NC&#8722;Fe(dppe)Cp][PF6]n (n=2, 3) (Cp=1,3&#8208;cyclopentadiene, dppe=1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane, L=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy, 1[PF6]n), 5,5&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl (5,5&#8217;&#8208;dmbpy, 2[PF6]n) and 4,4&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl (4,4&#8217;&#8208;dmbpy, 3[PF6]n)) have been synthesized and fully characterized. The experimental results suggest that all the one&#8208;electron oxidation products may belong to Class II&#8211;III mixed valence complexes, supported by TDDFT calculations. With the change of the substituents of the bipyridyl ligand on the Ru centre from H, 5,5&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl to 4,4&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl, the energy of MMCT for the one&#8208;electron oxidation complexes changes in the order: 13+&lt;23+&lt;33+, and that for the two&#8208;electron oxidation complexes decreases in the order 14+&gt;34+&gt;24+. The potential splitting (&#916;E1/2(2)) between the two terminal Fe centres for N[PF6]2 are the largest potential splitting for the cyanido&#8208;bridged complexes reported so far. This work shows that the smaller potential difference between the bridging and the terminal metal centres would result in the more delocalized mixed valence complex.

&#8220;Gold is a valuable component in electronic waste, but a major barrier towards its efficient recycling is the inability to selectively dissolve gold under mild and benign conditions. In this respect, our gold dissolution research is driven by the world's megatrends, such as resource scarcity and waste management challenges. Dissolution and recycling of noble metals is in the core of a circular economy and the challenge that our topic thiol&#8208;assisted dissolution of gold aspires to solve.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff.

         <title>Poloxometalates&#8208;based Semi&#8208;flexible Metal&#8208;semiconductor Triboelectric Nanogenerators for Low Frequency and Small Amplitude Mechanical Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost durable triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) is essential for converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. Many organic polymer friction materials used widely have  thermal stability  problems  , which makes TENGs with semiconductors  as friction materials stand out. Here, we report a semi&#8208;flexible TENG based on metal and TiO 2  modified by polyoxometalates (POMs) as pure inorganic friction materials. Six different POMs are firstly selected to modify the friction materials of TENGs, and the output performance of TENGs with different POMs&#8208;modified semiconductors and different metals as friction materials are tested. Compared with the unmodified TENGs, the open&#8208;circuit voltage ( V OC  ) of the optimal Ag&#8208;K 6  P 2  Mo 18  O 62  (P 2  Mo 18  )/TiO 2  TENG device is increased by more than 4 times,  which is mainly attributed to the strong electron&#8208;accepting and storage capabilities of POMs.  This study has demonstrated that TENGs modified by POMs have potential application prospects and provided a new method for increasing the electrical output of TENGs.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Dimeric Capsules with Appended Spiropyran Units: Towards Controlled Cargo Release</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of unprecedented tetra&#8208;urea derivatives of calix[4]arene and calix[4]pyrrole containing four spiropyran (SP) units at their upper rim. We investigate the photo&#8208; and acid&#8208;induced isomerization of the monomeric and homo&#8208;dimeric tetra&#8208;ureas derivatives using UV&#8208;Vis and 1H NMR spectroscopies. At micromolar concentration, irradiation of the samples with 365 nm light induces changes in their absorption spectra that are consistent with SP&#8594; merocyanine (MC) isomerization. However, analogous experiments at millimolar concentration do not produce noticeable changes in the 1H NMR spectra. The addition of triflic acid to micromolar and millimolar solutions of the tetra&#8208;ureas produces the quantitative isomerization of the SP units to the protonated merocyanine form (E&#8208;MCH+) and the simultaneous disassembly of the capsular dimers to form ill&#8208;defined aggregates. The neutralization of the acid solutions resets the SP form. Under these acid/base treatment conditions, the controlled release of the included guest and the reassembly of the all&#8208;SP tetra&#8208;urea dimers occurs at different extents depending on its calix[4]arene or calix[4]pyrrole scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling Polymerization Mechanism in pH&#8208;regulated Supramolecular Fibers in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An amine functionalized C  3  &#8208;symmetric benzotrithiophene (BTT) monomer has been designed and synthetized in order to form pH responsive one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymers in aqueous media. While most of the reported studies looked at the effect of pH on the size of the aggregates, herein we report a detailed mechanistic study carried out upon modifying the pH, triggering the formation of positively charged ammonium groups. A dramatic and reversible change in the polymerization mechanism and size of the supramolecular fibers is observed and ascribed to the combination of Coulombic repulsive forces and higher monomer solubility. Furthermore, the induced frustrated growth of the fibers is further employed to finely control the one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymerisation and copolymerization processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Erogorgiaene and the Pseudopterosin A&#8208;F Aglycone via Enantioselective Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrovinylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to their pronounced bioactivity and limited availability from natural resources, metabolites of the soft coral Pseudo&#172;pterogorgia elisabethae, such as erogorgiaene and the pseudo&#8211;pterosines, represent important target molecules for chemical synthesis. We have now developed a particularly short and efficient route towards these marine diterpenes exploiting an operationally convenient enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydrovinylation as the chirogenic step. Other noteworthy C&#8208;C bond forming transformations include diastereoselective Lewis acid&#8208;mediated cyclizations, a Suzuki coupling and a carbonyl ene reaction. Starting from 4&#8208;methyl&#8208;styrene the anti&#8208;tubercular agent (+)&#8208;erogorgiaene (&gt;98% ee) was prepared in only 7 steps with 46% overall yield. In addition, the synthesis of the pseudopterosin A aglycone was achieved in 12 steps with 30% overall yield and, surprisingly, was found to exhibit a similar anti&#8208;inflammatory activity (inhibition of LPS&#8208;induced NF&#8208;&#954;B activation) as a natural mixture of pseudopterosins A&#8208;D or iso&#8208;pseudopterosin A, prepared by &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;xylosylation of the synthetic aglycone</dc:description>

         <title>Ready access to anhydrous anionic lanthanide acetates using imidazolium acetate ionic liquids as the reaction medium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The access to lanthanide acetate coordination compounds is challenged by the tendency of lanthanides to coordinate water and the plethora of acetate coordination modes. We developed a straightforward, reproducible synthetic procedure by reaction of lanthanide chloride hydrates with defined ratios of the ionic liquid (IL) 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium acetate ([C  2  mim][OAc]). This reaction pathway leads to two isostructural crystalline anhydrous coordination complexes, the polymeric [C  2  mim]  n  [{Ln  2  (OAc)  7  }  n  ] and the dimeric [C  2  mim]  2  [Ln  2  (OAc)  8  ], based on the ion size and the ratio of IL used. A reaction with an IL:Ln&#8208;salt ratio of 5:1 where Ln = Nd, Sm, and Gd led exclusively to the polymeric, whilst for the heaviest lanthanides (Dy&#8208;Lu) dimeric was observed. Reaction with Eu and Tb resulted in a mixture of both polymeric and dimeric forms. By increasing the amount of IL and/or the size of the cation, the reaction led to only the dimeric compound for all the lanthanide series. Crystallographic analyses of the resulting salts revealed three different types of metal&#8208;acetate coordination modes where  &#951;  2  &#956;&#954;  2  is the most represented both structure types.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Trifluoromethoxylated (hetero)arenes are of great interest for several disciplines, especially in agro&#8208; and medicinal chemistry. Radical C&#8208;H trifluoromethoxylation of (hetero)arenes represents an attractive approach to prepare such compounds but the high cost and low atom economy of existing &#8226;OCF 3 radical sources makes them unsuitable for the large&#8208;scale synthesis of trifluoromethoxylated building blocks. Herein, we introduce bis(trifluoromethyl)peroxide (BTMP, CF 3 OOCF 3 ) as a practical and efficient trifluoromethoxylating reagent that is easily accessible from inexpensive bulk chemicals. Using either visible light photoredox or TEMPO catalysis, trifluoromethoxylated arenes could be prepared in good yields under mild conditions directly from unactivated aromatics. Moreover, TEMPO catalysis allowed for the one&#8208;step synthesis of valuable pyridine derivatives, which have been previously prepared via multi&#8208;step approaches.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;conventional Behavior of a 2,1&#8208;benzazaphosphole: Heterodiene or Hidden Phosphinidene?</title>

Compound  1  is also able to activate the C=C double bond in selected  N  &#8208;alkyl/aryl&#8208;maleimides RN(C(O)CH)  2  (R = Me,  t  Bu, Ph) resulting in the addition products  7  &#8208;  9  with bridged bicyclic [2.2.1] structures. The binding of the maleimides to  1  is semi&#8208;reversible upon heating. By contrast, when  1  was treated with selected TM complexes, it serves as a 4  e  donor bridging two TMs thus producing complexes [  &#956;  &#8208;ArP(AuCl)  2  ] (  10  ), [(  &#956;  &#8208;ArP)  4  Ag  4  ][X]  4  (X = BF  4  (  11  ), OTf (  12  )) and [  &#956;  &#8208;ArP(Co  2  (CO)  6  )] (  13  ).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoswitch triads comprised of two dihydroazulene (DHA) units in conjugation to a central  trans&#8208;  azobenzene (AZB) unit were prepared in stepwise protocols starting from  meta  &#8208; and  para  &#8208;disubstituted azobenzenes. The  para  &#8208;connected triad had significantly altered optical properties and lacked the photoactivity of the separate photochromes. Instead, for the  meta  &#8208;connected triad all three photochromes could be photoisomerized to generate an isomer with two vinylheptafulvene (VHF) units and a  cis&#8208;  azobenzene unit. The photoisomerizations were studied by ultrafast spectroscopy, revealing a fast DHA&#8208;to&#8208;VHF photoisomerization and a slower  trans  &#8208;to&#8208;  cis  AZB photoisomerization. This  meta  triad underwent thermal VHF&#8208;to&#8208;DHA back&#8208;conversions with a similar rate of all VHFs, independent of the identity of the neighboring units, and in parallel thermal  cis  &#8208;to&#8208;  trans  AZB conversion.

         <title>Contributions of Internal Atoms of Atomically Precise Metal Nanoclusters to Catalytic Performances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Every atom of a heterogeneous catalyst can play a direct or indirect role in its overall catalytic properties. However, it is extremely challenging to determine explicitly which atom(s) of a catalyst can dominantly contribute to its catalytic performance, because the observed performance usually reflects an ensemble average from all the atoms in the catalyst. The emergence of atomically precise metal nanoclusters brings unprecedented opportunities to address the above central issues, since the crystal structures of such nanoclusters have been solved and hence very fundamental understanding of nanocatalysis can be attained at an atomic level. This review focuses on recent efforts to reveal the contributions of the internal atoms or vacancies of the nanocluster catalysts to the catalytic processes, including that the catalytic activity can be dramatically changed by the central doping of a foreign atom; the catalytic activation and inactivation can be reversibly switched by shuttling the central atom into and out of nanoclusters; the evolution in catalytic activity can be driven by structural periodicity in the inner kernels of the nanoclusters. We anticipate that the progress in this research area could represent a novel conceptual framework for understanding the crucial roles of internal atoms of the catalysts in tuning the catalytic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Suppressing Dehydroisomerization Boosts n&#8208;Butane Dehydrogenation with High Butadiene Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Butadiene (BD) is a critical raw material in chemical industry, which is conventionally produced from naphtha cracking. The fast&#8208;growing demand of BD and the limited oil reserve motivate chemists to develop alternative methods for BD production. Shale gas, which mainly consists of light alkanes, has been considered as cheap raw materials to replace oil for BD production via  n  &#8208;butane direct dehydrogenation (  n  &#8208;BDH). However, the quest for highly&#8208;efficient catalysts for  n  &#8208;BDH is driven by the current drawback of low BD selectivity. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for boosting the selectivity of BD by suppressing dehydroisomerization, an inevitable step in the conventional  n  &#8208;BDH process which largely reduces the selectivity of BD. Detailed investigations show that the addition of alkali&#8208;earth metals (e.g., Mg and Ca) into Pt&#8208;Ga  2  O  3  /S10 catalysts increases Pt dispersity, suppresses coke deposition and dehydroisomerization, and thus leads to the significant increase of BD selectivity. The optimized catalyst displays an initial BD selectivity of 34.7% at a  n  &#8208;butane conversion of 82.1% at 625  o  C, which outperforms the reported catalysts in literatures. This work not only provides efficient catalysts for BD production via  n  &#8208;BDH, but also promotes the researches on catalyst design in heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the Topological Landscape by a G&#8208;Column Flip of a Parallel G&#8208;Quadruplex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting with a parallel&#8208;stranded DNA G&#8208;quadruplex, refolding into a novel (3+1) hybrid topology with a propeller&#8208;propeller&#8208;lateral loop architecture and an all&#8208;syn 3&#8217;&#8208;terminal G&#8208;tract is reported. Although supported by additional stacking of a lateral duplex hairpin onto an outer G&#8208;tetrad, the structural rearrangement must be enforced through the specific incorporation of syn&#8208;favoring 8&#8208;bromoguanosine analogues into the terminal G&#8208;run.







Abstract
Canonical G&#8208;quadruplexes can adopt a variety of different topologies depending on the arrangement of propeller, lateral, or diagonal loops connecting the four G&#8208;columns. A novel intramolecular G&#8208;quadruplex structure is derived through inversion of the last G&#8208;tract of a three&#8208;layered parallel fold, associated with the transition of a single propeller into a lateral loop. The resulting (3+1) hybrid fold features three syn&#8901;anti&#8901;anti&#8901;anti G&#8208;tetrads with a 3&#8217;&#8208;terminal all&#8208;syn G&#8208;column. Although the ability of forming a duplex stem&#8208;loop between G&#8208;tracts seems beneficial for a propeller&#8208;to&#8208;lateral loop rearrangement, unmodified G&#8208;rich sequences resist folding into the new (3+1) topology. However, refolding can be driven by the incorporation of syn&#8208;favoring guanosine analogues into positions of the fourth G&#8208;stretch. The presented hybrid&#8208;type G&#8208;quadruplex structure as determined by NMR spectroscopy may provide for an additional scaffold in quadruplex&#8208;based technologies.

However, refolding can be driven by the incorporation of &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-favoring guanosine analogues into positions of the fourth G-stretch. The presented hybrid-type G-quadruplex structure as determined by NMR spectroscopy may provide for an additional scaffold in quadruplex-based technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Dipyrrolyldiketone PtII Complexes: Ion&#8208;Pairing &#960;&#8208;Electronic Systems with Various Anion&#8208;Binding Modes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dipyrrolyldiketone PtII complexes, as phosphorescence&#8208;emitting and anion&#8208;responsive &#960;&#8208;electronic systems with planar geometries, were synthesized to construct ion&#8208;pairing assemblies in the form of anion complexes. The ordered arrangements of the anion complexes and countercations, including porphyrin AuIII complexes, were formed via noncovalent interactions between oppositely and identically charged species in the solid state.







Abstract
A variety of &#960;&#8208;electronic ion&#8208;pairing assemblies can be constructed by combining anion complexes of &#960;&#8208;electronic systems and countercations. In this study, a series of anion&#8208;responsive &#960;&#8208;electronic molecules, dipyrrolyldiketone PtII complexes containing a phenylpyridine ligand, were synthesized. The resulting PtII complexes exhibited phosphorescence emission, with higher emission quantum yields (0.30&#8211;0.42) and microsecond&#8208;order lifetimes, and solution&#8208;state anion binding, as revealed by our spectroscopic analyses. These PtII complexes displayed solid&#8208;state ion&#8208;pairing assemblies, exhibiting various anion&#8208;binding modes, which derived from pyrrole&#8208;inverted and pyrrole&#8208;non&#8208;inverted conformations, and packing structures, with the contribution of charge&#8208;by&#8208;charge assemblies, which were dependent on the substituents in the PtII complexes and the geometries and electronic states of their countercations.

         <title>Enantioselective Protonation of Cyclic Carbonyl Ylides by Chiral Lewis Acid Assisted Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective protonation of cyclic carbonyl ylides by chiral Lewis acid assisted alcohol addition reactions featuring a dual catalytic system is reported. The unique heterobicyclic products bearing a quaternary heteroatom&#8208;substituted carbon center were obtained with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The alcohol adducts were successfully converted to optically active oxazolidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones by hydrolysis. Computational mechanistic studies indicated that a stepwise syn&#8208;addition of alcohols under the influence of a Lewis acid was favored.







Abstract
Chiral Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alcohol addition reactions to cyclic carbonyl ylides generated from N&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;diazocarbonyl)&#8208;2&#8208;oxazolidinones featuring a dual catalytic system are reported. Construction of a chiral quaternary heteroatom&#8208;substituted carbon center was accomplished in which the unique heterobicycles were obtained in good yields with high stereoselection. The alcohol adducts were successfully converted to optically active oxazolidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones by hydrolysis. Mechanistic studies by DFT calculations revealed that alcohols could be activated by Lewis acids, enabling enantioselective protonation of the carbonyl ylides.

         <title>Structure and Reactivity of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Alkynyl Hypervalent Iodine Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four new N&#8208;heterocyclic alkynyl hypervalent iodine reagents have been synthesized. Their structures and reactivity are described and compared to already reported cyclic hypervalent iodine reagents, showing less extended &#963; holes for tosylated reagents. Good alkyne transfer properties towards strong nucleophiles were observed, but applications in radical and metal&#8208;catalyzed processes were more limited.







Abstract
Ethynylbenziodoxol(on)e (EBX) cyclic hypervalent iodine reagents have become popular reagents for the alkynylation of radicals and nucleophiles, but only offer limited possibilities for further structure and reactivity fine&#8208;tuning. Herein, the synthesis of new N&#8208;heterocyclic hypervalent iodine reagents with increased structural flexibility based on amide, amidine and sulfoximine scaffolds is reported. Solid&#8208;state structures of the reagents are reported and the analysis of the I&#8722;Calkyne bond lengths allowed assessing the trans&#8208;effect of the different substituents. Molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps of the reagents, derived from DFT computations, revealed less pronounced &#963;&#8208;hole regions for sulfonamide&#8208;based compounds. Most reagents reacted well in the alkynylation of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters. The alkynylation of thiols afforded more variable yields, with compounds with a stronger &#963;&#8208;hole reacting better. In metal&#8208;mediated transformations, the N&#8208;heterocyclic hypervalent iodine reagents gave inferior results when compared to the O&#8208;based EBX reagents.

         <title>Atomic Layer Deposition of Ternary Indium/Tin/Aluminum Oxide Thin Films, Their Characterization and Transistor Performance under Illumination.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ternary metal oxide semiconducting multilayer structure of composition [In2O3//SnO2//Al2O3] is accessible by an atomic layer deposition (ALD) approach. Oxygen deficiency in these ALD derived thin films can be effectively manipulated and controlled by adding a distinct number of alumina monolayers. Besides its semiconducting behavior, the incorporation of the alumina monolayers alters the light stability of the semiconducting multilayer thin film in a thin film transistor device under illumination in the radiation range between 300&#8211;600&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Multilayered heterostructures comprising of In2O3, SnO2, and Al2O3 were studied for their application in thin&#8208;film transistors (TFT). The compositional influence of tin oxide on the properties of the thin&#8208;film, as well as on the TFT characteristics is investigated. The heterostructures are fabricated by atomic layer deposition (ALD) at 200&#8201;&#176;C, employing trimethylindium (TMI), tetrakis(dimethylamino)tin (TDMASn), trimethylaluminum (TMA), and water as precursors. After post&#8208;deposition annealing at 400&#8201;&#176;C the thin&#8208;films are found to be amorphous, however, they show a discrete layer structure of the individual oxides of uniform film thickness and high optical transparency in the visible region. Incorporation of only two monolayers of Al2O3 in the active semiconducting layer the formation of oxygen vacancies can be effectively suppressed, resulting in an improved semiconducting and switching behavior. The heterostacks comprising of In2O3/SnO2/Al2O3 are incorporated into TFT devices, exhibiting a saturation field&#8208;effect mobility (&#956;sat) of 2.0&#8197;cm2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, a threshold&#8208;voltage (Vth) of 8.6&#8197;V, a high current on/off ratio (IOn/IOff) of 1.0&#215;107, and a subthreshold swing (SS) of 485&#8197;mV&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;dec&#8722;1. The stability of the TFT under illumination is also altered to a significant extent. A change in the transfer characteristic towards conductive behavior is evident when illuminated with light of an energy of 3.1&#8197;eV (400&#8197;nm).

         <title>Merging Molecular Recognition and Gold(I) Catalysis with Triphoscalix[6]arene Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New wheels for cycloisomerizations: We report the synthesis of novel trinuclear triphosphine&#8208;gold(I)&#8208;calix[6]arene complexes A and B. These multitasking supramolecular wheels, which could be employed as a platform for the synthesis of interwoven (pseudo)rotaxanes species, displayed catalytic features promoting highly selective cycloisomerizations of 1,6&#8208;enynes.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of novel triphosphine calix[6]arene ligands. These supramolecular wheels, with recognition features governed by the hydrogen&#8208;bonding domain, were employed to synthesize multitasking trinuclear gold(I) complexes as a new platform for the synthesis of interwoven (pseudo)rotaxane species. In parallel, the multivalent, metal&#8208;bonded upper rim displayed catalytic features promoting highly selective gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization reactions of 1,6&#8208;enynes.

         <title>Accessing C2&#8208;Functionalized 1,3&#8208;(Benz)azoles through Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metals play revolutionary role in achieving regioselective and chemodivergent C&#8722;H activation attaining step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economy. Introducing synthetically manipulative functional groups to omnipresent backbone 1,3&#8208;(benz)azoles has never been easier with this diverse set of metal catalysts and tailored ligands. This review article presents a collective summary of all metal catalysts used to rapidly extend the synthetic library of azoles.







Abstract
The skeletal presence of 1,3&#8208;azoles in a variety of bioactive natural products, pharmacophores, and organic materials demands the derivatization of such heteroarenes regioselectively. Plenty of cross&#8208;coupling as well as cyclocondensation reactions have been performed to build up these skeletons but remained commercially unrealizable. A couple of severe drawbacks are faced by these traditional protocols that require a more straightforward strategy to obviate them. Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization has emerged as a superior alternative in that context. 1,3&#8208;Azoles and their benzo counterparts have been extensively functionalized exploiting both noble and earth&#8208;abundant transition metals. Lately, C&#8208;2 functionalization have gained much traction due to the ease of attaining high regioselectivity and installation of synthetically manipulative functionalities. This critical review presents a bird&#8216;s eye view of all major C&#8208;2 functionalization of (benz)azoles catalyzed by a diverse set of metals performed over the past 15&#8197;years.

         <title>Steric Effects on the Thermal Processes of Hemithioindigo Based Molecular Motor Rotation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the detailed mechanism behind directional rotation of light driven molecular motors is a necessary prerequisite for the conscious design of their properties. In this work the influence of sterical hindrance on the speed of helix inversion in hemithioindigo&#8208;based molecular motors is elucidated. Unexpectedly, increasing steric hindrance at two different positions on the rotor fragment is found to have opposite effects: at the aliphatic position helix inversion is accelerated while at the aromatic position this process is slowed down.







Abstract
Tuning the thermal behavior of light driven molecular motors is fundamentally important for their future rational design. In many molecular motors thermal ratcheting steps are comprised of helicity inversions, energetically stabilizing the initial photoproducts. In this work we investigated a series of five hemithioindigo (HTI) based molecular motors to reveal the influence of steric hindrance in close proximity to the rotation axle on this process. Applying a high yielding synthetic procedure, we synthesized constitutional isomeric derivatives to distinguish between substitution effects at the aromatic and aliphatic position on the rotor fragment. The kinetics of thermal helix inversions were elucidated using low temperature 1H NMR spectroscopy and an in&#8197;situ irradiation technique. In combination with a detailed theoretical description, a comparative analysis of substituent effects on the thermal helix inversions of the rotation cycle is now possible. Such deeper understanding of the rotational cycle of HTI molecular motors is essential for speed regulation and future applications of visible light triggered nanomachines.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Oxazolomycins B and C</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis confirms structures: The first total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;oxazolomycin B and (+)&#8208;oxazolomycin C was achieved in a longest linear sequence of 25 steps from the amino acid serine in 3.6 and 2.7&#8201;% overall yield, respectively. The completion of the total synthesis showed that the hypothesized structures of the natural products are correct.







Abstract
Efforts towards the first total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;oxazolomycin B and (+)&#8208;oxazolomycin C from the intermediate of our previous synthesis of (+)&#8208;neoxazolomycin are reported. The syntheses were achieved in a longest linear sequence of 25 steps from the amino acid serine in 3.6 and 2.7&#8201;% overall yields, respectively. The efficiency of our approach is derived from silyl triflate&#8208;mediated reductive oxazolidine ring&#8208;opening and F&#252;rstner's Ru&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation and protodesilylation reactions. The obtained spectra and optical rotations were in good agreement with those of natural products, thus confirming the structures.

         <title>Solvato Modulation of the Magnetic Memory in Isotopically Enriched Erbium Polyoxometalate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) property is not based on solvent crystallization molecules but hydrated polyoxometalate(POM)&#8211;based Na9[Er(W5O18)2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;35H2O and its dehydrated form relax differently. Experimental and theoretical investigations evidence that the stability of the edifice depends on labile water molecules. Furthermore, isotopic enrichment at ErIII site shows that the relaxation dynamics in the quantum regime depends on the nuclear spin.







Abstract
Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) property is by essence molecular, while commonly measured in solid crystalline state. Solvent crystallization molecules are usually neglected in the analysis and interpretation of solid&#8208;state properties. The solvation/desolvation process in the polyoxometalate(POM)&#8208;based Na9[Er(W5O18)2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;35&#8201;H2O SMM demonstrates that the dehydrated form relaxes more than 1000 times faster than the initial state, while the rehydration process allows the quasi complete recovering of the initial magnetic behaviour. This dehydration process is monitored by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and temperature&#8208;dependent X&#8208;ray powder diffraction, and rationalized by periodic quantum chemical calculations evidencing the tremendous role of the labile water molecules in the stability of the edifice. Ab&#8208;initio calculations highlight that sodium ions localization in the structure drive the magnetic responses. Isotopic enrichment with nuclear spin free (166Er, I=0) ErIII ions shows that the relaxation dynamics in the quantum regime depends on the nuclear spin.

         <title>Amorphous Calcium Phosphates: Solvent&#8208;Controlled Growth and Stabilization through the Epoxide Route</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) is a key nanobiomaterial where shape, size and phase purity remain as a synthetic challenge. Herein, we have adapted the Epoxide Route for the synthesis of pure and stable ACP colloids by using biocompatible solvents such as ethylene glycol and/or glycerine. The solvent mixture can be used as a new green tool to control the size (from 60 nm to &gt;500 nm) and the internal mesostructured (fractal dimension).







Abstract
Calcium phosphates stand among the most promising nanobiomaterials in key biomedical applications, such as bone repairment, signalling or drug/gene delivery. Their intrinsic properties as crystalline structure, composition, particle shape and size define their successful use. Among these compounds, metastable amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) is currently gaining particular attention due to its inherently high reactivity in solution, which is crucial in bone development mechanisms.

     alt="Amorphous Calcium Phosphates: Solvent-Controlled Growth and Stabilization through the Epoxide Route"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amorphous calcium phosphate&lt;/b&gt; (ACP) is a key nanobiomaterial where shape, size and phase purity remain as a synthetic challenge. Herein, we have adapted the Epoxide Route for the synthesis of pure and stable ACP colloids by using biocompatible solvents such as ethylene glycol and/or glycerine. The solvent mixture can be used as a new green tool to control the size (from 60 nm to &amp;gt;500 nm) and the internal mesostructured (fractal dimension).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calcium phosphates stand among the most promising nanobiomaterials in key biomedical applications, such as bone repairment, signalling or drug/gene delivery. Their intrinsic properties as crystalline structure, composition, particle shape and size define their successful use. Among these compounds, metastable amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) is currently gaining particular attention due to its inherently high reactivity in solution, which is crucial in bone development mechanisms. However, the preparation of this highly desired (bio)material with control over its shape, size and phase purity remains as a synthetic challenge. In this work, the epoxide route was adapted for the synthesis of pure and stable ACP colloids. By using biocompatible solvents, such as ethylene glycol and/or glycerine, it was possible to avoid the natural tendency of ACP to maturate into more stable and crystalline apatites. Moreover, this procedure offers size control, ranging from small nanoparticles (60&#8197;nm) to micrometric spheroids (&amp;gt;500&#8197;nm). The eventual fractalization of the internal mesostructured can be tuned, by simply adjusting the composition of the ethylene glycol:glycerine solvent mixture. These findings introduce the use of green solvents as a new tool to control crystallinity and/or particle size in the synthesis of nanomaterials, avoiding the use of capping agents and preserving the natural chemical reactivity of the pristine surface.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Functional Carbazole&#8208;Fullerene Complexes: A New Perspective of Carbazoles Acting as Nano&#8208;Octopus to Capture Globular Fullerenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of carbazolic derivatives are reported to associate with fullerenes as a novel host class. Different amounts of carbazole units and tunable bridged linker modulated the binding strength and its alternated arrangement pattern. Benefit from the continuous C60&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C60 short&#8208;contact channels, promising electron&#8208;transport and photovoltaic effects are achieved in the host&#8208;guest complex devices.







Abstract
Fullerene host&#8208;guest constructs have attracted increasing attention owing to their molecular&#8208;level hybrid arrangements. However, the usage of simple carbazolic derivatives to bind with fullerenes is rare. In this research, three novel carbazolic derivatives, containing a tunable bridging linker and carbazole units for the capturing of fullerenes, are rationally designed. Unlike the general concave&#8208;convex interactions, fullerenes could interact with the planar carbazole subunits to form 2&#8208;dimensional hexagonal/quadrilateral cocrystals with alternating stacking patterns of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 or 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 stoichiometry, as well as the controllable fullerene packing modes. At the meanwhile, good electron&#8208;transporting performances and significant photovoltaic effects were realized when a continuous C60&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C60 interaction channel existed. The results indicate that the introduction of such carbazolic system into fullerene receptor would provide new insights into novel fullerene host&#8208;guest architectures for versatile applications.

In this research, three novel carbazolic derivatives, containing a tunable bridging linker and carbazole units for the capturing of fullerenes, are rationally designed.

         <title>Design and Application of Mini&#8208;libraries of miRNA Probes for an Efficient and Versatile miRNA&#8208;mRNA Cross&#8208;linking</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a new class of miRNA probes with photo&#8208;active trioxsalen attached via oligoethylene glycol&#8208;based linkers. These cross&#8208;link to RNA targets in&#8197;vitro with efficiencies dependent on sequence and linker&#8208;length. By using controlled mixtures of probes, a general approach to efficient covalent target&#8208;capture independent of miRNAs sequence is proposed.







Abstract
MicroRNAs constitute a class of endogenous, non&#8208;coding RNAs that influence various processes within the cell. By base&#8208;pairing to partially&#8208;complementary sites located in the 3&#8217; untranslated region of target messenger RNAs, microRNAs participate in post&#8208;transcriptional regulation of the majority of human protein&#8208;coding genes. Their dysregulation has been related to many pathological processes and diseases. Thus, an in&#8208;depth understanding of the microRNA mechanisms of action is crucial. Here, we present a new concept of probe design to achieve an efficient and sequence&#8208;independent miRNA&#8208;mRNA cross&#8208;linking. The new strategy is based on the utilization of a controlled mixture of probes for a chosen miRNA, in which a trioxsalen moiety is introduced at the N4&#8208;position of a selected cytidine through short oligoethylene glycol&#8208;based linkers. In vitro photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking experiments with mini&#8208;libraries of probes for microRNAs of interest showed variable cross&#8208;linking efficiencies, demonstrating a general applicability of the presented approach.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the field of medicinal chemistry the precise installation of a trideuteromethyl group is gaining ever&#8208;increasing attention. Site&#8208;selective incorporation of the deuterated &#8220;magic methyl&#8221; group can provide profound pharmacological benefits and can be considered as an important tool for drug optimization and development. This review provides a structured overview, according to the trideuteromethylation reagent, of currently established methods for site&#8208;selective trideuteromethylations of carbon atoms. Selective introduction of CD2H and CDH2 groups, in addition to CD3, is also considered. For all methods, the corresponding mechanism and scope are discussed whenever reported. As such, this review can be a starting point for synthetic chemists to further advance trideuteromethylation methodologies. At the same time, this review aims to be a guide for medicinal chemists, offering them the available C&#8208;CD3 formation strategies for the preparation of new or modified drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Establishing a &#8220;Ring Size&#8208;Divergent&#8221; Synthetic Strategy: Synthesis, Structural Revision, and Absolute Configuration of Feroniellins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Feroniellin analogs isolated from  Feroniella lucida  possess a furanocoumarin skeleton connected with monoterpenic five&#8208; to seven&#8208;membered ethereal rings by an ether linkage and exhibit a broad spectrum of biological activities. In this contribution, we intended to establish a &#8220;ring size&#8208;divergent&#8221; synthetic strategy for the monoterpenic five&#8208; to seven&#8208;membered ethereal rings through the chemical sythesis of feroniellins. Herein, we report the short and comprehensive synthesis of feroniellins has been achieved in only 2 steps from easily available bergamottin based on the &#8220;ring size&#8208;divergent&#8221; strategy. In addition, these syntheses resulted in revision of the proposed structures for feroniellins A and B and the determination of all the absolute configurations of feroniellins, and further their preliminary anti&#8208;inflammatory activities were investigated as well.</dc:description>

         <title>Rationalizing the Mechanism of Peroxyformate Decomposition: Computational Insights to Understand Solvent Influence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The heterolytic decomposition of tert&#8208;butyl peroxyformate to tert&#8208;butanol and carbon dioxide, catalyzed by pyridine, is a long&#8208;known example of a reaction whose kinetics are strongly affected by solvent polarity. Through DFT and ab initio methods together with the SMD implicit solvation model, we propose an extension on the formerly accepted mechanism. Our novel proposal involves the formation of a carbonic acid ester intermediate and its further decomposition, through an unreported pyridine&#8208;mediated stepwise route. Computed barriers for this mechanism at the DLPNO/CCSD(T)&#8208;def2&#8208;TZVP are in excellent agreement with experimental kinetic data across different solvents. Furthermore, the strong relationships between activation energies, geometric parameters in the transition state and the characteristics of the different solvents are also analyzed in depth.</dc:description>

Using 0.2 mol% of the developed [Cu(dmp)(XantphosTEPD)]PF  6  &#160;under blue LEDs irradiation, the hydrosilylation of a large panel of alkenes and alkynes was performed in good to excellent yields with a large functional group tolerance.

         <title>In Situ Synchrotron X&#8208;ray Diffraction Studies of the Mechanochemical Synthesis of ZnS from its Elements.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochemistry, as a synthesis tool for inorganic materials, became an ever&#8208;growing field in material chemistry. The direct energy transfer by collision of the educts with the milling media gives the possibility to design environmental&#8208;friendly reactions. Nevertheless, the underlying process of energy transfer and hence the kinetics of mechanosynthesis remain unclear. Herein, we present  in situ  synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction studies coupled with pressure measurements performed during the formation of ZnS and the subsequent phase transition (PT) from the hexagonal to the cubic modification. Milling Zn and S  8  results in the sublimation of S  8  , observed by a sudden pressure increase. Simultaneously, the hexagonal metastable ZnS&#8208;modification (wurtzite) forms. Via detection of the pressure maximum, the exact start of the wurtzite formation can be determined. Immediately after the formation of wurtzite, the structural PT to the thermodynamic stable cubic modification sphalerite takes place. This PT can be described by the Prout&#8208;Tompkins equation for autocatalytic reactions, similar to thermally induced PT in sulfur vapor at high temperatures (T&gt;1133 K). The increase in the reactivity of the wurtzite formation is explained by the reaction in sulfur vapor and the induction of defect structures by the collisions with the milling media.</dc:description>

         <title>BODIPYs with Photoactivatable Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The borondipyrromethene (BODIPY) chromophore is a versatile platform for the construction of photoresponsive dyes with unique properties. Specifically, its covalent connection to a photocleavable group can be exploited to engineer compounds with photoswitchable fluorescence. The resulting photoactivatable fluorophores can increase their emission intensity or shift their emission wavelengths in response to switching. Such changes permit the spatiotemporal control of fluorescence with optical stimulations and the implementation of imaging strategies that would be impossible to replicate with conventional fluorophores. Indeed, BODIPYs with photoactivatable fluorescence enable the selective highlighting of intracellular targets, the nanoscaled visualization of sub&#8208;cellular components, the real&#8208;time monitoring of dynamic events and the photochemical writing of optical barcodes.</dc:description>

         <title>PorphyStruct &#8211; A Digital Tool for the Quantitative Assignment of Non&#8208;Planar Distortion Modes in Four&#8208;Membered Porphyrinoids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>PorphyStruct  , a new digital tool for the analysis of non&#8208;planar distortion modes of different porphyrinoids, and its application to corrole structures is reported. The program makes use of the normal&#8208;coordinate structure decomposition technique (NSD) and employs sets of normal modes equivalent to those established for porphyrins in order to describe the  out&#8208;of&#8208;plane  dislocation pattern of perimeter atoms from corroles, norcorroles, porphycenes and other porphyrinoids quantitatively and in analogy to the established terminology. A comparative study of 17 porphyrin structures shows very similar results to the original NSD analysis and no systematic error. Application to corroles is successful and reveals the necessity to implement an extended basis of normal modes for a large share of experimental structures.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;PorphyStruct  , a new digital tool for the analysis of non-planar distortion modes of different porphyrinoids, and its application to corrole structures is reported. The program makes use of the normal-coordinate structure decomposition technique (NSD) and employs sets of normal modes equivalent to those established for porphyrins in order to describe the  out-of-plane  dislocation pattern of perimeter atoms from corroles, norcorroles, porphycenes and other porphyrinoids quantitatively and in analogy to the established terminology. A comparative study of 17 porphyrin structures shows very similar results to the original NSD analysis and no systematic error. Application to corroles is successful and reveals the necessity to implement an extended basis of normal modes for a large share of experimental structures. The results frequently show the concomitant occurence of several modes but remain interpretable. For group XI metal corroles the phenomenon of supersaddling was unravelled, allowing for more in-depths discussions of structure-function correlations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>While alkyl substituted siloxanes are widely known, virtually nothing is known about perfluoroalkyl siloxanes and their congener species, the silanols and silanolates. We recently reported on the tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanide ion, [Si(C2F5)3]&#8722;, which features&#160;Lewis&#160;amphoteric character deriving from the pentafluoroethyl substituents and their strong electron&#8208;withdrawing properties. Transferring this knowledge, we investigated the&#160;Lewis&#160;amphoteric behavior of the tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanolate,&#160;[Si(C2F5)3O]&#8722;. In order to examine such&#160;Lewis&#160;amphoteric behavior, we first developed a strategy for the synthesis of the corresponding silanol Si(C2F5)3OH, which readily condenses at room temperature to the hexakis(pentafluoroethyl)disiloxane,&#160;(C2F5)3SiOSi(C2F5)3.&#160;Deprotonation of Si(C2F5)3OH employing a sterically demanding phosphazene base allows the characterization of the first example of a dimeric triorganosilanolate: the dianionic hexakis(pentafluoroethyl)disilanolate,&#160;[{Si(C2F5)3O}2]2&#8722;, implies&#160;Lewis&#160;amphoteric character of the monomeric&#160;[Si(C2F5)3O]&#8722;&#160;anion.</dc:description>

         <title>Through Bridge Spin Coupling in Homo&#8208; and Hetero&#8208;bimetallic Porphyrin Dimers upon Stepwise Oxidations: A Spectroscopic and Theoretical Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have described Cu(II)&#8208;Fe(III) and Cu(II)&#8208;Mn(III) heterobimetallic porphyrin dimers and compared with their homo&#8208;bimetallic analogs. UV&#8208;visible spectra are very distinct while electrochemical studies demonstrate that these species, as compared to the homobimetallic analog, are much easier to oxidize. Combined M&#246;ssbauer, EPR, NMR, magnetic, UV&#8208;vis and DFT studies show only ring&#8208;centered oxidation after 2e&#8208;oxidations. The HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps are linearly dependent with the low&#8208;energy NIR band of 2e&#8208;oxidized complexes. Strong electronic communication between two rings through the bridge facilitates coupling between various unpaired spins while the coupling model depends on the nature of metal ions used. Unpaired spins of Fe(III) and porphyrin &#960;&#8208;cation radical are strongly anti&#8208;ferromagnetically coupled, while such coupling is rather weak between Mn(III) and porphyrin &#960;&#8208;cation radical. Moreover, the coupling between two &#960;&#8208;cation radicals are much stronger in the 2e&#8208;oxidized complexes of Mn2(III) and Cu(II)&#8208;Mn(III) complexes as compared to their Fe2(III) and Cu(II)&#8208;Fe(III) analogs. Furthermore, coupling between the unpaired spins of &#960;&#8208;cation radical and Cu(II) ion is much stronger in the 2e&#8208;oxidized complex of Cu(II)&#8208;Fe(III) complex as compared to its Cu(II)&#8208;Mn(III) analog. The Mulliken spin density distributions in 2e&#8208;oxidized homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;bimetallic complexes show symmetric and asymmetric spread between the two macrocycles, respectively, however, the Cu(II) center acts as a charge donor in the heterobimetallic complexes while Fe(III)/Mn(III) center as a charge acceptor.</dc:description>

         <title>Triangular Rhodamine Triads and Their Intrinsic Photophysics Revealed from Gas&#8208;phase Ion Fluorescence Experiments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>When ionic dyes are close together, the internal Coulomb interaction may affect their photophysics and the energy&#8208;transfer efficiency. To explore this, we have prepared triangular architectures of three rhodamines connected to a central triethynylbenzene unit (1,3,5&#8208;tris(buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyn&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzene) based on acetylenic coupling reactions and measured fluorescence spectra of the isolated, triply charged ions  in vacuo  . We find from comparisons with previously reported monomer and dimer spectra that while polarization of the &#960;&#8208;system causes redshifted emission, the separation between the rhodamines is too large for a Stark shift. This picture is supported by electrostatic calculations on model systems composed of three linear and polarizable ionic dyes in  D  3h  configuration: The electric field that each dye experiences from the other two is too small to induce a dipole moment, both in the ground and the excited state. In the case of heterotrimers that contain either two rhodamine 575 (R575) and one R640 or one R575 and two R640, emission is almost purely from R640 although the polarization of the &#960;&#8208;system expectedly diminishes the dipole&#8208;dipole interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Coinage Metal Complexes with Di&#8208;Tertiary&#8208;Butyl Sulfide as Precursors with Ultra&#8208;Low Decomposition Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here synthesis of [Cu2(TFA)4(t  Bu2S)2] (1), [Ag4(TFA)4(t  Bu2S)4] (2) and [AuCl(t  Bu2S)] (3) (TFA = trifluoroacetate), which decompose in solution medium at ultra&#8208;low temperature (e.g., in boiling toluene) to afford phase&#8208;pure and highly crystalline Cu9S5  , Ag2S and metallic Au nanoparticles, respectively. The low decomposition temperature of these precursors is attributed to the facile decomposition mechanism in the di&#8208;tertiary&#8208;butyl sulfide ligand. These results are a significant step in the direction of establishing a general low&#8208;temperature strategy spanning a range of systems including thermodynamically metastable materials and incorporate them in technologies that are sensitive to the harsh conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Three&#8208;Dimensional (3D) (Di)azatricyclododecene Scaffold and its Application to Peptidomimetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel sp  3  carbon&#8208;rich tricyclic 3D scaffold&#8208;based peptide mimetic compound library was constructed to target protein&#8208;protein interactions. T ricyclic framework  6  was synthesized from 9&#8208;azabicyclo[3,3,1]nonan&#8208;3&#8208;one  9  via a gold (I)&#8208;catalyzed Conia&#8208;ene reaction. The electron&#8208;donating group on the pendant alkyne of cyclization precursor  11b&#8208;e  was the key to forming 6&#8208;  endo  &#8208;  dig  cyclized product  6  with complete regioselectivity. Using the synthetic strategy for regioselective construction of bridged tricyclic framework  6  , a diazatricyclododecene 3D&#8208;scaffold  7a  , which enables the introduction of substituents into the scaffold to mimic amino acid side chains, was designed and synthesized. The peptide mimetics  20a&#8208;h  were synthesized via step&#8208;by&#8208;step installation of three substituents on diazatricyclododecene scaffold  7a  . C o mpounds  20a&#8208;h  were synthesized as &#945;&#8208;helix peptide mimics of hydrophobic ZZxxZ and ZxxZZ sequences (Z = Leu or Phe) and subjected to cell&#8208;based assays: antiproliferative activity, HIF&#8208;1 transcriptional activity which is considered to affect cancer malignancy , and antiviral activity against rabies virus. Compound  20a  showed the strongest inhibitory activity of HIF&#8208;1 transcriptional activity (IC  50  = 4.1 &#177; 0.8 &#956;M), whereas compounds  20a&#8208;g  showed antiviral activity with IC  50  values of 4.2&#8208;12.4 &#956;M, suggesting that the 3D&#8208;scaffold  7a  has potential as a versatile peptide mimic skeleton.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Regulation of Catalytic Activity for an Amphiphilic Pyrene&#8208;Ruthenium Complex in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A switchable catalytic system is designed and constructed with host&#8208;guest interactions between cucurbituril (CB) and an amphiphilic metal complex Pyrene&#8208;Ruthenium (Py&#8208;Ru). Py&#8208;Ru can self&#8208;assemble into positively charged nanoparticles in water, and exhibit an enhanced catalytic efficiency in the transfer hydrogenation of NAD  +  to NADH. After forming inclusion complex with CB, Py&#8208;Ru aggregates are broke, leading to a decrease of catalytic efficiency, which can be recovered via competitive replacement of amantadine (AD). This supramolecular strategy provides an efficient and flexible method for constructing reversible catalytic system, which also extends the application scope of the host&#8208;guest interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Monitoring the Structure Evolution of Titanium Oxide Photocatalysts: From the Molecular Form via the Amorphous State to the Crystalline Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amorphous TixOy  with high surface area has attracted significant interest as photocatalyst with higher activity in ultraviolet (UV) light&#8208;induced water splitting applications compared to commercial nanocrystalline TiO2. Under photocatalytic operation conditions, the structure of the molecular titanium alkoxide precursor rearranges upon hydrolysis and leads to higher connectivity of the structure&#8208;building units. Structurally ordered domains with sizes smaller than 7 &#197; form larger aggregates. The experimental scattering data can be explained best with a structure model consisting of an anatase&#8208;like core and a distorted shell. Upon exposure with UV light, the white TixOy  suspension turns dark corresponding to the reduction of Ti  4+  to Ti  3+  as confirmed by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). Heat&#8208;induced crystallisation was followed by  in situ  temperature&#8208;dependent total scattering experiments. First, ordering in the Ti&#8208;O environment takes place upon to 350 &#176;C. Above this temperature, the distorted anatase core starts to grow but the structure obtained at 400 &#176;C is still not fully ordered.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure Elucidation and Spectroscopic Analysis of Chromophores Produced by Oxidative Psilocin Dimerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Psilocin (  1  ) is the dephosphorylated and psychotropic metabolite of the mushroom natural product psilocybin (  2  ). Oxidation of the phenolic hydroxy group at the C&#8208;4 position of  1  results in formation of oligomeric indoloquinoid chromophores responsible for the iconic blueing of bruised  2  &#8208;producing mushrooms. Based on previous NMR experiments, the hypothesis included that the 5,5&#8217;&#8208; coupled quinone dimer of  1  was the primary product responsible for the blue color. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized ring&#8208;methylated  1  derivatives to provide stable analogs of  1  dimers able to be completely characterized. The chemically oxidized derivatives were spectroscopically analyzed and compared to computationally&#8208;derived absorbance spectra. Experimental evidence did not support the original hypothesis. Rather, the blue color was shown to stem from the quinoid 7,7&#8217;&#8208;coupled dimer of  1  .</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While the integration of supramolecular principles in catalysis attracts increasing attention, a direct comparative assessment of the resulting systems catalysts to work&#8208;out distinct characteristics is often difficult.&#160; Here, we report that the broad responsiveness of ether cyclizations to diverse input promises to fill this gap. &#160;Cyclizations in the confined, &#960;&#8208;basic and Br&#248;nsted acidic interior of supramolecular capsules, for instance, are found to excel with speed (exceeding general Br&#248;nsted acid and hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysts by far) and selective violations of the Baldwin rules (as extreme as the so far unique pnictogen&#8208;bonding catalysts).&#160; The complementary cyclization on &#960;&#8208;acidic aromatic surfaces remains unique with regard to autocatalysis, which is shown to be chemo&#8208; and diastereoselective with regard to product&#8208;like co&#8208;catalysts but, so far, not enantioselective.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Alpha&#8208;amanitin, an extremely toxic bicyclic octapeptide extracted from the death&#8208;cap mushroom,  Amanita phalloides,  is a highly selective allosteric inhibitor of RNA polymerase II. Following on growing interest in using this toxin as a payload in antibody&#8208;drug conjugates, herein we report the synthesis and biochemical evaluation of several new derivatives of this toxin to probe the role of the  trans  &#8208;hydroxyproline (Hyp), which is known to be critical for toxicity. This structure activity relationship (SAR) study represents the first of its kind to use various Hyp&#8208;analogs to alter the conformational and H&#8208;bonding properties of Hyp in amanitin.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphate&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Immolative Linkers for Tunable Double Cargo Release</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphorus&#8208;based self&#8208;immolative (SI) linkers offer a wide range of applications, such as smart materials and drug delivery systems. Phosphorus SI linkers are ideal candidates for double cargo delivery platforms because they have a higher valency than carbon. Accordingly, we designed a series of substituted phosphate linkers for releasing two phenolic cargos through SI followed by chemical hydrolysis. Suitable modifications of the lactate spacer increased the cargo release rate significantly, from 1 day to 2 hours or 5 minutes, as shown for linkers containing  p  &#8208;fluoro phenol. In turn, double cargo linkers bearing  p  &#8208;methyl phenol released their cargo more slowly (4 days, 4 hours, and 15 minutes, respectively) than their  p  &#8208;fluoro analogues. The  &#945;  &#8208;hydroxyisobutyrate linker released both cargos in 25 minutes. Our study expands the current portfolio of SI constructs by providing a double cargo delivery option, which is crucial to develop universal SI platforms.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatiotemporal Resolved Live Cell Membrane Tracking through&#160;Photo&#8208;click Reactions Enriched in Lipid Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of photo&#8208;switchable monopeptides derived from  cis  &#8208;&#946;&#8208;dibenzodiazocine&#8208;  l  &#8208;alanine (  cis  &#8208;DBDAA) have been designed and synthesized, which are capable of photo&#8208;click reacting with diaryltetrazoles or diarylsydnones in a hydrophobic phospholipid bilayer environment. The DBDAA monopeptides include both a hydrophobic tail on  C  &#8208;terminal, providing high affinity toward lipid membrane, and a modularized functional moiety on N&#8208;terminal, enabling rapid optimization of the self&#8208;assembly strength to form multifunctional supramolecules. With the  cis  &#8208;DBDAA monopeptides photo&#8208;switched into  trans  &#8208;configuration, we were able to disrupt the supramolecular assembly through an efficient photo&#8208;click reaction across the lipid bilayer of liposomes. We reveal that the performance of the photo&#8208;click reactions between the monopeptides and photo&#8208;generated nitrile imine intermediates is significantly enhanced by enrichment of both reactants in the hydrophobic membrane lamel of liposomes. Enrichment of the DBDAA monopeptide in lipid phase serves as a convenient method to introduce bioorthogonal chemical handles on live cell membranes, which enables fluorescence labelling of single cell's membrane with high spatiotemporal resolution to facilitate the studies on cell membrane dynamics.</dc:description>

         <title>Taking advantage of ortho&#8208; and peri&#8208;substitution to design nine&#8208;membered P,O,Si&#8208;heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A family of cyclic phosphine&#8208;disiloxane featuring peri&#8208;substituted naphthyl(Nap)/acenaphthyl(Ace) scaffolds have been prepared and fully characterized including X&#8208;ray structure, which enables a detailed structural analysis. This straightforward synthesis takes advantage of both ortho&#8208; and peri&#8208;substitution of Nap/Ace&#8208;substituted phosphine oxides. The synthetic method allows diversifying the polycyclic aromatic platform (Nap and Ace) as well as the Si substituents (Me and Ph). Despite a strong steric congestion, the P&#8208;atom remains reactive toward oxidation or coordination. In particular, Au(I) complex could be prepared. All the compounds display absorption/luminescence in the UV&#8208;Vis range. Surprisingly, the P&#8208;trivalent derivatives display unexpected luminescence in the green in solid&#8208;state.</dc:description>

         <title>Fe(II) metallohelices stabilize DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes and down&#8208;regulate expression of G&#8208;quadruplex regulated oncogenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) were identified within the promoter regions of many proto&#8208;oncogenes. Thus, G4s represent attractive targets for cancer therapy and the design and development of new drugs as G4 binders is a very active field of medicinal chemistry. Here, we employed methods of molecular biophysics and biology to investigate the interaction of chiral metallohelices with a series of four DNA G4s (  hTelo  ,  c&#8208;myc  ,  c&#8208;kit1  ,  c&#8208;kit2  ) that are formed by the human telomeric sequence (  hTelo  ) and in the promoter regions of  c&#8208;MYC  and  c&#8208;KIT  proto&#8208;oncogenes. We show that the investigated water&#8208;compatible optically pure metallohelices made by self&#8208;assembly of simple nonpeptidic organic components around Fe(II) ions, which exhibit bioactivity emulating the natural systems, bind with high affinity to G4 DNA and much lower affinity towards duplex DNA. Notably, both enantiomers of metallohelix containing  m  &#8208;xylenyl bridge (  5b  ) were found to be effective inhibitors of primer elongation catalyzed by  Taq  DNA polymerase by stabilizing G4 structures formed in the template strands containing  c&#8208;myc  and  c&#8208;kit2  G4&#8208;forming sequences. Moreover, both enantiomers of  5b  down&#8208;regulated the expression of  c&#8208;MYC  and  c&#8208;KIT  oncogenes in human embryonic kidney cells at mRNA and protein levels. As metallohelices also bind alternative nucleic acid structures, they hold promise as potential multi&#8208;targeted drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>The Construction of DNA Logic Gates Restricted in Live Cells Based on Structure Programmability and Aptamer&#8208;cell Affinity of G&#8208;quadruplex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA computation is considered as one fascinating alternative to silicon&#8208;based computers, which has evoked substantial attention and gained rapid advancements. Besides realizing versatile functions, implementing spatiotemporal control of logic operations, especially in cellular level, is also of great significance to the development of DNA computation. However, developing simple and efficient methods to restrict DNA logic gates performing in live cells is still a challenge. In this work, we designed a series of DNA logic gates by taking full advantage of the diversity and programmability of G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structure. More importantly, by further utilizing the high affinity and specific endocytosis of cells to aptamer G4, we have achieved in realizing an  INHIBIT  logic gate whose operational site is precisely restricted in specific live cells. The design strategy may have great potential in the field of molecular computation and smart bio&#8208;applications.</dc:description>
