         <title>Not All Binding Sites Are Equal: Site Determination and Folding State Analysis of Gas&#8208;phase Protein&#8211;Metallodrug Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modern approaches in metallodrug research focus on compounds that bind protein targets rather than DNA. However, the identification of protein targets and binding sites is challenging. Using intact mass spectrometry and proteomics, we investigated the binding of antimetastatic agent RAPTA&#8208;C to the model proteins ubiquitin, cytochrome c, lysozyme and myoglobin. Binding to cytochrome c and lysozyme was negligible. However, ubiquitin bound up to three Ru moieties, two of which were localized at Met1 and His68 as [Ru(cym)], and [Ru(cym)] or [Ru(cym)(PTA)] adducts, respectively. Myoglobin bound up to four [Ru(cym)(PTA)] moieties and five sites were identified at His24, His36, His64, His81/82 and His113. Collision&#8208;induced unfolding (CIU) studies via ion&#8208;mobility mass spectrometry allowed measuring protein folding as a function of collisional activation. CIU of protein&#8211;RAPTA&#8208;C adducts showed binding of [Ru(cym)] to Met1 caused a significant compaction of ubiquitin, likely from N&#8208;terminal S&#8211;Ru&#8211;N chelation, while binding of [Ru(cym)(PTA)] to His residues of ubiquitin or myoglobin induced a smaller effect. Interestingly, the folded state of ubiquitin formed by His&#8208;functionalization was more stable than Met1 metalation. The data suggests that selective metalation of amino acids at different positions on the protein impacts the conformation and potentially the biological activity of anticancer compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction and Formic Acid Oxidation by Formal Nickel(I) Complexes of Di&#8208;isopropylphenyl Bis&#8208;iminoacenaphthene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The (dpp&#8211;bian)NiBr2 complex emerged as a robust precatalyst for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide, showcasing notable selectivity in producing methane as the final product. In the course of the catalytic reaction, three&#8211;electron reduced nickel complexes with a formal nickel charge of +1 were identified as intermediates.







Abstract
Processing CO2 into value&#8211;added chemicals and fuels stands as one of the most crucial tasks in addressing the global challenge of the greenhouse effect. In this study, we focused on the complex (dpp&#8211;bian)NiBr2 (where dpp&#8211;bian is di&#8208;isopropylphenyl bis&#8208;iminoacenaphthene) as a precatalyst for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 into CH4 as the sole product. Cyclic voltammetry results indicate that the realization of a catalytically effective pattern requires the three&#8211;electron reduction of (dpp&#8211;bian)NiBr2. The chemically reduced complexes [K(THF)6]+[(dpp&#8211;bian)Ni(COD)]&#8722; and [K(THF)6]+[(dpp&#8211;bian)2Ni]&#8722; were synthesized and structurally characterized. Analyzing the data from the electron paramagnetic resonance study of the complexes in solutions, along with quantum&#8211;chemical calculations, reveals that the spin density is predominantly localized at their metal centers. The superposition of trajectory maps of the electron density gradient vector field 
 and the electrostatic force density field 
 per electron, as well as the atomic charges, discloses that, within the first coordination sphere, the interatomic charge transfer occurs from the metal atom to the ligand atoms and that the complex anions can thus be formally described by the general formulae (dpp&#8211;bian)2&#8722;Ni+(COD) and (dpp&#8211;bian)2&#8722;Ni+. It was also shown that the reduced nickel complexes can be oxidized by formic acid; resulting from this reaction, the two&#8211;electron and two&#8211;proton addition product dpp&#8211;bian&#8211;2H is formed.

         <title>Co(II) Substitution Enhances the Esterase Activity of a de Novo Designed Zn(II) Carbonic Anhydrase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Co(II) analogue of the designed peptide Zn(II)(TRIL23H)3 is made as a spectroscopic probe for the carbonic anhydrase activity exhibited by this de novo designed system. The coordination geometry of Co(II) and Zn(II) are vastly different at high and low pH. Nonetheless, the Co(II) analogue at high pH exceeds the catalytic efficiency of the parent Zn(II) protein.







Abstract
Carbonic Anhydrases (CAs) have been a target for de&#8197;novo protein designers due to the simplicity of the active site and rapid rate of the reaction. The first reported mimic contained a Zn(II) bound to three histidine imidazole nitrogens and an exogenous water molecule, hence closely mimicking the native enzymes&#8217; first coordination sphere. Co(II) has served as an alternative metal to interrogate CAs due to its d7 electronic configuration for more detailed solution characterization. We present here the Co(II) substituted [Co(II)(H2O/OH&#8722;)]N(TRIL2WL23H)3n+ that behaves similarly to native Co(II) substituted human&#8208;CAs. Like the Zn(II) analogue, the cobalt&#8208;derivative at slightly basic pH is incapable of hydrolyzing p&#8208;nitrophenylacetate (pNPA); however, as the pH is increased a significant activity develops, which at pH values above 10 eventually yields a catalytic efficiency that exceeds that of the [Zn(II)(OH&#8722;)]N(TRIL2WL23H)3+ peptide complex. X&#8208;ray absorption analysis is consistent with an octahedral species at pH&#8197;7.5 that converts to a 5&#8208;coordinate species by pH&#8197;11. UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy can monitor this transition, giving a pKa for the conversion of 10.3. We assign this conversion to the formation of a 5&#8208;coordinate Co(II)(Nimid)3(OH)(H2O) species. The pH dependent kinetic analysis indicates the maximal rate (kcat), and thus the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km), follow the same pH profile as the spectroscopic conversion to the pentacoordinate species. This correlation suggests that the chemically irreversible ester hydrolysis corresponds to the rate determining process.

         <title>Combined Covalent and Supramolecular Polymerization to Reinforce Perylenebisimide Photosynthetic &#8220;Quantasomes&#8221;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the paired function of Photosystem II (PSII) supercomplexes, artificial quantasomes (QS) are formed by encapsulating the deca&#8208;anionic oxygen&#8208;evolving catalyst Ru4POM within a multichromophoric &#8220;corolla&#8221; of cationic perylenebisimides. Covalent fixation of the QS supramolecular network is obtained herein by photo&#8208;polymerization of styrene terminals installed on the PBI antennas (QS&#8208;PolyS), enhancing the oxygenic photocurrent and stability under high solar irradiance.







Abstract
PSII&#8208;inspired quantasomes have emerged as promising artificial photosystems evolving oxygen from water due to their integrated multi&#8208;chromophore asset, hierarchical architecture, and efficient light&#8208;harvesting capabilities. In this study, we adopt a combined covalent and supramolecular strategy by implementing a poly&#8208;styrene backbone that reinforces proximity and pairing between adjacent perylenebisimide (PBI) quantasome units. The covalent fixation of the quantasome network results in a significant enhancement of the photoelectrocatalytic performance on engineered IO&#8208;ITO photoanodes, with up to 290&#8201;% photocurrent increase (J up to 100&#8197;&#956;A cm&#8722;2, &#955; &gt;450&#8197;nm, applied bias &lt;1.23&#8197;V vs RHE, F.E.O2 &gt;80&#8201;%) compared to the non&#8208;polymerized analog. Moreover, the direct PBI&#8208;quantasome polymerization on the photoanode surface was performed by light irradiation of the radical initiator 2,2&#8217;&#8208;Azobis(2&#8208;methylpropionamidine), improving the photoelectrode robustness under high solar irradiance (&gt;8 suns) and limiting the photocurrent loss (&lt;20&#8201;%) at 1.52&#8197;V vs RHE compared to the non&#8208;polymerized system.

Moreover, the direct PBI-quantasome polymerization on the photoanode surface was performed by light irradiation of the radical initiator 2,2&#8217;-Azobis(2-methylpropionamidine), improving the photoelectrode robustness under high solar irradiance (&amp;gt;8 suns) and limiting the photocurrent loss (&amp;lt;20&#8201;%) at 1.52&#8197;V vs RHE compared to the non-polymerized system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Aminobenzocoumarins as Fluorescent Probes for Biological Acidity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulation of pH plays an essential role in orchestrating the delicate cellular machinery responsible for life as we know it. Its abnormal values are indicative of aberrant cellular behavior and associated with pathologies including cancer progression or solid tumors. Here, we report a series of bent and linear aminobenzocoumarins decorated with different substituents. We investigate their photophysical properties and demonstrate that the probes display strong pH&#8208;responsive fluorescence &#8220;turn on&#8221; behavior in highly acidic environments, with enhancement up to 300&#8208;fold. In combination with their low cytotoxicity, this behavior enabled their application in bioimaging of acidic lysosomes in live human cells. We believe that these molecules serve as attractive lead structures for future rational design of novel biocompatible fluorescent pH probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights into the Mechanism of Neptunium Oxidation to the Heptavalent State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomistic insights in the ozonolysis of Np(V) to form Np(VII) under alkaline conditions and role of co&#8208;solutes in the rate of the oxidation are explored through UV/Vis and vibrational spectroscopic analysis. Additional Density Functional Theory calculations are utilized to understand the mechanism of the oxidation reaction and possible intermediate species.







Abstract
Neptunium can exist in multiple oxidation states, including the rare and poorly understood heptavalent form. In this work, we monitored the formation of heptavalent neptunium [Np(VII)O4(OH)2]3&#8722; during ozonolysis of aqueous MOH (M=Li, Na, K) solutions using a combined experimental and theoretical approach. All experimental reactions were closely monitored via absorption and vibrational spectroscopy to follow both the oxidation state and the speciation of neptunium guided by the calculated vibrational frequencies for various neptunium species. The mechanism of the reaction partly involves oxidative dissolution of transient Np(VI) oxide/hydroxide solid phases, the identity of which are dependent on the co&#8208;precipitating counter&#8208;cation Li+/Na+/K+. Additional calculations suggest that the most favorable energetic pathway occurs through the reaction of a [Np(V)O2(OH)4]3&#8722; with the hydroxide radical to form [Np(VI)O2(OH)4]2&#8722;, followed by an additional oxidation with HO&#8901; to create [Np(VII)O4(OH)2]3&#8722;.

         <title>Flowmicro In&#8208;Line Analysis&#8208;Driven Design of Reactions mediated by Unstable Intermediates: Flash Monitoring Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flash monitoring: Direct observation of anionic polymerizing methacrylates was achieved by utilizing flow microreactors, which can transfer the unstable intermediates to spectroscopic instrument before they decompose. The in&#8208;line analysis of poly(methacrylate) anions revealed their structure, stability, and livingness, enabling the anionic polymerization and copolymerization of oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylates.







Abstract
The direct observation of reactive intermediates is an important issue for organic synthesis. However, intermediates with an extreme instability are hard to be monitored by common spectroscopic methods such as FTIR. We have developed synthetic method utilizing flow microreactors, which enables a generation and reactions of unstable intermediates. Herein we report that, based on our flowmicro techniques, we developed an in&#8208;line analysis method for reactive intermediates in increments of milliseconds. We demonstrated the direct observation of the living and dead species of the anionic polymerization of alkyl methacrylates. The direct information of the living species enabled the anionic polymerization and copolymerization of oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylates, which is the important but difficult reaction in the conventional method.

         <title>Different Reaction Modes Operating in ansa&#8208;Half&#8208;Sandwich Magnesium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Show me how many ligands you accept, and I will tell you how you react: depending on the number of ligands that the ansa&#8208;half&#8208;sandwich magnesium catalyst can bind, our DFT calculations show that the mechanism proceeds differently with competitive reaction channels.







Abstract
Magnesium&#8208;based catalysts are becoming popular for hydroelementation reactions specially using p&#8208;block reagents. Based on the seminal report from Sch&#228;fer's group (ChemCatChem 2022, 14, e202201007), our study demonstrates that the reaction mechanisms exhibit a far greater degree of complexity than originally presumed. Magnesium has a variety of coordination modes (and access to different hybridizations) which allows this electron&#8208;deficient centre to modulate its catalytic power depending on the &#963;&#8208;donor properties of the reagent. DFT calculations demonstrate several reaction channels closely operating in these versatile catalysts. In addition, variations in limiting energy barriers resulting from catalyst modifications were examined as a function of the Hammett constant, thereby predicting enhanced efficiency in reaction conversions.

&lt;p&gt;Magnesium-based catalysts are becoming popular for hydroelementation reactions specially using p-block reagents. Based on the seminal report from Sch&#228;fer's group (&lt;i&gt;ChemCatChem&lt;/i&gt; 2022, 14, e202201007), our study demonstrates that the reaction mechanisms exhibit a far greater degree of complexity than originally presumed. Magnesium has a variety of coordination modes (and access to different hybridizations) which allows this electron-deficient centre to modulate its catalytic power depending on the &#963;-donor properties of the reagent. DFT calculations demonstrate several reaction channels closely operating in these versatile catalysts. In addition, variations in limiting energy barriers resulting from catalyst modifications were examined as a function of the Hammett constant, thereby predicting enhanced efficiency in reaction conversions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3&#8208;Oxidopyridinium Ions Are Versatile Bioorthogonal Dipoles for Use in Cycloadditions with Cyclooctynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[3+2] cycloadditions between 3&#8208;oxidopyridiniums and the common bioorthogonal reagent dibenzocyclooctyne (DIBO) are kinetically tuned by substitution at the 5 position, where a linear Hammett relationship is seen to favour electron donating groups. Second&#8208;order rate constants on the order of 1&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 have been achieved in acetonitrile at room temperature.







Abstract
3&#8208;oxidopyridinium ions are water stable and soluble heteroaromatic betaines that behave as latent dipoles and undergo a wide variety of cycloadditions. Research into the cycloaddition reactions of 3&#8208;oxidopyridiniums was spearheaded by Alan R. Katritzky and collaborators from the early 1970s until the late 1980s, but they have yet to be used for bioorthogonal applications. Herein we report that 3&#8208;oxidopyridiniums can readily react with 4&#8208;dibenzocyclooctynol (DIBO), a common bioorthogonal handle, in a [3+2] cycloaddition. The mechanism was investigated by altering the electronics of the reaction by changing the substituent on the 5 position of the pyridinium. Electron&#8208;donating 5&#8208;substituents have been shown to significantly increase the rate of the reaction, with bimolecular rate constants ranging from 3.3&#215;10&#8722;4&#8201;s&#8722;1 with 5&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxidopyridinium to 1.07&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 with 5&#8208;amino&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxidopyridinium. 3&#8208;oxidopyridiniums&#8217; appreciable cycloaddition rates and compatibility with bioorthogonally relevant environments give them the potential to be used in a variety of bioconjugation applications.

         <title>Toward Lung Ventilation Imaging Using Hyperpolarized Diethyl Ether Gas Contrast Agent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyperpolarized diethyl ether gas was produced via heterogeneous pairwise parahydrogen addition to ethyl vinyl ether (a.k.a. vinamar) anesthetic gas and employed for a pilot feasibility demonstration to record sub&#8208;second 2D ventilation MRI of excised rabbit lungs on a clinical 0.35 T MRI scanner without any modifications to the scanner's hardware or software.







Abstract
Hyperpolarized 129Xe gas was FDA&#8208;approved as an inhalable contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging of a wide range of pulmonary diseases in December 2022. Despite the remarkable success in clinical research settings, the widespread clinical translation of HP 129Xe gas faces two critical challenges: the high cost of the relatively low&#8208;throughput hyperpolarization equipment and the lack of 129Xe imaging capability on clinical MRI scanners, which have narrow&#8208;bandwidth electronics designed only for proton (1H) imaging. To solve this translational grand challenge of gaseous hyperpolarized MRI contrast agents, here we demonstrate the utility of batch&#8208;mode production of proton&#8208;hyperpolarized diethyl ether gas via heterogeneous pairwise addition of parahydrogen to ethyl vinyl ether. An approximately 0.1&#8208;liter bolus of hyperpolarized diethyl ether gas was produced in 1 second and injected in excised rabbit lungs. Lung ventilation imaging was performed using sub&#8208;second 2D MRI with up to 2&#215;2&#8197;mm2 in&#8208;plane resolution using a clinical 0.35&#8197;T MRI scanner without any modifications. This feasibility demonstration paves the way for the use of inhalable diethyl ether as a gaseous contrast agent for pulmonary MRI applications using any clinical MRI scanner.

         <title>When is an Imine Directing Group a Transient Imine Directing Group in C&#8722;H Functionalization?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building on the pioneering works using imines to form metallacycle with transition metals, recent developments have realized the potential of using transient directing group (TDG) to direct C&#8722;H functionalization. This article discusses factors defining a transient directing group and strategies to achieve catalytic processes with low directing group loading by highlighting recent advancements in this field.







Abstract
&#8216;Transient&#8217; C&#8722;H functionalization has emerged in recent years to describe the use of a dynamic linkage, often an imine, to direct cyclometallation and subsequent functionalization. As the field continues to grow in popularity, we consider the features that make an imine directing group transient. A transient imine should be i) formed dynamically in&#8197;situ, ii) avoid discrete introduction or cleavage steps, and iii) offer the potential for catalysis in both the directing group and metal. This concept article contrasts transient imines with pioneering early studies of imines as directing groups for the formation of metallacycles and the use of preformed imines in C&#8722;H functionalization. Leading developments in the use of catalytic additives to form transient directing groups (as aldehyde or amine) are covered including selected highlights of the most recent examples of catalytic imine directed C&#8722;H functionalization with transition metals.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Flip via Subtle Electronic Perturbation in Axially Ligated Diiron(III) Porphyrin Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A slight electronic perturbation at the axial ligand of the diheme resulted in a large change in the electronic structures with a spin&#8208;flip from high to intermediate via an admixed state. This is at par with the metalloenzymes, which employ minute perturbations around the periphery of the active sites, leading to spin state transitions.







Abstract
Spin state switching in the metal center is a crucial phenomenon in many enzymatic reactions in biology. The spin state alteration, a critical step in cytochrome P450 catalysis, is driven most likely through a weak perturbation upon substrate binding in the enzyme, which is still not well clarified. In the current work, the spin state transition of iron(III) from high to intermediate via an admixed state is observed upon a subtle electronic perturbation to the sulphonate moieties coordinated axially to a diiron(III)porphyrin dimer. While electron&#8208;donating substituents stabilize the high&#8208;spin state of iron(III), strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing groups stabilize an intermediate&#8208;spin state, whereas the moderate electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of axial ligands resulted in an admixed state. Confirmation of the molecular structures and their spin states have been made utilizing single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis, M&#246;ssbauer, magnetic, EPR, and 1H NMR spectroscopic investigations. The position of the signals of the porphyrin macrocycle in the paramagnetic 1H NMR is found to be very characteristic of the spin state of the iron center in solution. The Curie plot for the pure high&#8208;spin complexes shows the signals&#8242; temperature dependency in line with the Curie law. Conversely, the pure intermediate&#8208;spin state of iron exhibits an anti&#8208;Curie temperature dependence, whereas the admixed&#8208;spin state of iron displays significant curvature of the lines in the Curie plot. An extensive DFT analysis displays a linear dependence between the energy difference between d
 and d
 orbital versus Fe&#8722;Npor distance for the complexes reported here. Furthermore, a strong linear correlation between the Fe&#8722;O distance and the spin density over the oxygen atom, as well as the Fe&#8722;Npor distance for the complexes, has been observed. Thus, a slight electronic perturbation at the axial ligand of the diheme resulted in a large change in the electronic structures with a spin&#8208;flip. This is at par with the metalloenzymes, which employ minute perturbations around the periphery of the active sites, leading to spin state transitions.

         <title>In2Q2: A New Entry of 16&#8208;Membered Tetraazamacrocycle Concatenating Indole and Quinoline Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of 16&#8208;membered macrocycles comprising two indole (In) and two quinoline (Q) units, coined In2Q2, was synthesized. Each unit is diagonally located and concatenated in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail fashion, furnishing a non&#8208;flat saddle&#8208;shaped architecture with C2 symmetry. The In2Q2 derivatives and their Zn2+ complexes were emissive in both solution phase and solid state. While the entire architecture of In2Q2 is similar to that of quinoline tetramer TEtraQuinoline, a couple of contrasting properties were revealed.







Abstract
A new family of 16&#8208;membered macrocycles comprising two indole (In) and two quinoline (Q) units, coined In2Q2, was synthesized. Each unit is diagonally located and concatenated in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail fashion, furnishing a non&#8208;flat saddle&#8208;shaped architecture with C2 symmetry. The synthetic protocol utilizing macrocyclic diamide as a pivotal precursor allowed us to access a series of In2Q2 derivatives bearing various substituents on the periphery. The In2Q2 derivatives and their Zn2+ complexes were emissive in both solution phase and solid state. While the entire architecture of In2Q2 is similar to that of quinoline tetramer TEtraQuinoline, a couple of contrasting physicochemical properties were revealed.

         <title>The Role of Base in Reaction Performance of Photochemical Synthesis of Thiazoles: An Integrated Theoretical and Experimental Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work focuses on the prediction of the synthesis of 2&#8208;arylbenzothiazole. Different AI/ML methods are then employed for model training and testing. Feature analysis is conducted through the model interpretation process, enabling further exploration into the reaction mechanisms. We then chose two substrates of distinct structures and verified the predictions through experimental benchwork. This represents a novel reaction with different bases.







Abstract
Artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) is emerging as pivotal in synthetic chemistry, offering revolutionary potential in retrosynthetic analysis, reaction conditions and reaction prediction. We have combined chemical descriptors, primarily based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, with various AI/ML tools such as Multi&#8208;Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Random Forest (RF), to predict the synthesis of 2&#8208;arylbenzothiazole in photoredox reactions. Significantly, our models underscore the critical role of the molecular structure and physicochemical characteristics of the base, especially the total atomic polarizabilities, in the rate&#8208;determining steps involving cyclohexyl and phenethyl moieties of the substrate. Moreover, we validated our findings in articles through experimental studies. It showcases the power of AI/ML and quantum chemistry in shaping the future of organic chemistry.

         <title>Flowmicro in&#8208;Line Analysis&#8208;Driven Design of Reactions Mediated by Unstable Intermediates: Flash Monitoring Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flash monitoring approach led to the direct observation of reactive intermediates in anionic polymerization. By using flow microreactors and in&#8208;line spectroscopic devices, the living ends of anionic polymerization could be analyzed by FTIR within milliseconds to seconds of their generation. Precise control of the reaction temperature and time revealed the stability of these reactive species, enabling an efficient block&#8208;copolymerization. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Nagaki and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303774).

         <title>Magnetic&#8208;Field&#8208;Induced Spin Regulation&#160;in Electrocatalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of a magnetic field to manipulate spin states has emerged as a novel approach to enhance efficiency in electrocatalytic reactions, distinguishing from traditional strategies that focus on tuning activation energy barriers. Currently, this approach is specifically tailored to reactions where spin states change during the catalytic process, such as the oxidation of singlet H2O to triplet O2. In the magnetically enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) procedure, the parallel spin alignment on the ferromagnetic catalyst was induced by the external magnetic field, facilitating the triplet O&#8208;O bonding, which is the rate limiting step in OER. This review centers on recent advancements in harnessing external magnetic fields to enhance OER performance, delving into mechanistic approaches for this magnetic promotion. Additionally, we provide a summary of magnetic field application in other electrocatalytic reactions, including oxygen reduction, methanol oxidation, and CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Eight&#8208;Electron Copper Nanoclusters for Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to distinct physicochemical properties in comparison to gold and silver counterparts, atomically precise copper nanoclusters are attracting embryonic interest in material science. The introduction of copper cluster nanomaterials in more interesting fields is currently urgent and desired. Reported in this work are novel copper nanoclusters of [XCu54Cl12(tBuS)20(NO3)12] (X = S or none, tBuSH = 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;propanethiol), which exhibit high performance in photothermal conversion. The clusters have been prepared in one pot, and characterized by combinatorial techniques including ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy (UV&#8208;vis), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS), and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The molecular structure of the clusters, as revealed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis (SCXRD), shows the concentric three&#8208;shell Russian doll arrangement of X@Cu14@Cl12@Cu40. Interestingly, the [SCu54Cl12(tBuS)20(NO3)12] cluster contains 8 free valence electrons in its structure, making it the first eight&#8208;electron copper nanocluster stabilized by thiolates. More impressively, the clusters possess an effective photothermal conversion (temperature increases by 71oC within ~50 s, &#955;ex = 445 nm, 0.5 W cm&#8208;2) in a wide wavelength range (either blue or near&#8208;infrared). The photothermal conversion can be even driven under irradiation of simulated sunlight (3 sun), endowing the clusters with great potency in solar energy utilizaiton.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>[Gd(HP&#8208;DO3A)] (gadoteridol) as an active compound of ProHance&#174; is a widely employed contrast agent in clinical MRI scans in the last 30 years. Recent concerns about the long&#8208;term retention of gadolinium&#8208;based contrast agents (GBCAs) led to a deeper investigation of the structural features underlying the integrity of the paramagnetic metal complex. Several human and nonclinical studies have noted marked differences among the macrocyclic GBCAs, with the least retention of Gd traces and most rapid elimination consistently being reported for [Gd(HP&#8208;DO3A)]. It was deemed of interest to assess how minor structural/electronic changes associated to the ligand structure may affect basic properties of the metal complex with several [Gd(HP&#8208;DO3A)] analogues synthesized and characterized in the last years. We recently reported that the closest homolog of [Gd(HP&#8208;DO3A)], i.e.: [Gd(HB&#8208;DO3A)], in which&#160;(&#177;)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;propyl pendant arm is replaced by&#160;(&#177;)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;butyl moiety, showed a significantly different retention behaviour in the model interaction with collagen, despite the apparently very minor structural difference.&#160;In this paper we report a comprehensive study of the structural, thermodynamic, kinetic and relaxation properties of [Gd(HB&#8208;DO3A)], compared to the parent [Gd(HP&#8208;DO3A)] and to other closely related macrocyclic GBCAs to assess whether very minor structural changes can modulate the physico&#8208;chemical properties of Gd3+ complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Endowing Metal&#8208;Organic Coordination Materials with Chiroptical Activity by a Chiral Anion Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, chiral metal&#8208;organic coordination materials have emerged as promising candidates for a wide range of applications in chiroptoelectronics, chiral catalysis, and information encryption, etc. Notably, the chiroptical effect of coordination chromophores makes them appealing for applications such as photodetectors, OLEDs, 3D displays, and bioimaging. The direct synthesis of chiral coordination materials using chiral organic ligands or complexes with metal&#8208;centered chirality is very often tedious and costly. In the case of ionic coordination materials, the combination of chiral anions with cationic, achiral coordination compounds through noncovalent interactions may endow molecular materials with desirable chiroptical properties. The use of such a simple chiral strategy has been proven effective in inducing promising circular dichroism and/or circularly polarized luminescence signals. This concept article mainly delves into the latest advances in exploring the efficacy of such a chiral anion strategy for transforming achiral coordination materials into chromophores with superb photo&#8208; or electro&#8208;chiroptical properties. In particular, ionic small&#8208;molecular metal complexes, metal clusters, coordination supramolecular assemblies, and metal&#8208;organic frameworks containing chiral anions are discussed. A perspective on the future opportunities on the preparation of chiroptical materials with the chiral anion strategy is also presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Wireless Light&#8208;emitting Electrode Arrays for the Evaluation of Electrocatalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water splitting has become a sustainable and clean alternative for hydrogen production. Commonly, the efficiency of such reactions is intimately related to the physico&#8208;chemical properties of the catalysts that constitute the electrolyzer. Thus, the development of simple and fast methods to evaluate the electrocatalytic efficiency of an electrolyzer is highly required. In this work, we present an unconventional method based on the combination of bipolar electrochemistry and light&#8208;emitting diodes, which allows the evaluation of the electrocatalytic performance of the two types of catalysts composing an electrolyzer, namely for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions. The integrated light emission of the diode acts as an optical readout of the electrocatalytic information, which simultaneously depends on the composition of the anode and the cathode. The electrocatalytic activity of Au, Pt and Ni electrodes, connected to the LED in multiple anode/cathode configurations, towards the water splitting reactions has been evaluated. The efficiency of the electrolyser can be represented in terms of the onset electric field (&#949;onset) for light emission, obtaining variations that are in agreement with data reported with conventional electrochemistry. This work introduces a straightforward method for evaluating electrocatalysts and underscores the importance of material characterization in developing efficient electrolyzers for hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling High Activation of Glucose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate Dehydrogenase Activity Trough Liquid Condensate Formation and Compression</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Droplet formation via liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation is thought to be involved in the regulation of various biological processes, including enzymatic reactions. We investigated a glycolytic enzymatic reaction, the conversion of glucose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate to 6&#8208;phospho&#8208;D&#8208;glucono&#8208;1,3&#8208;lactone with concomitant reduction of NADP+ to NADPH both in the absence and presence of dynamically controlled liquid droplet formation. Here, the nucleotide serves as substrate as well as the scaffold required for the formation of liquid droplets. To further expand the process parameter space, temperature and pressure dependent measurements were performed. Incorporation of the reactants in the liquid droplet phase led to a boost in enzymatic activity, which was most pronounced at medium&#8208;high pressures. The crowded environment of the droplet phase induced a marked increase of the affinity of the enzyme and substrate. An increase in turnover number in the droplet phase at high pressure contributed to a further strong increase in catalytic efficiency. Enzyme systems that are dynamically coupled to liquid condensate formation may be the key to deciphering many biochemical reactions. Expanding the process parameter space by adjusting temperature and pressure conditions can be a means to further increase the efficiency of industrial enzyme utilization and help uncover regulatory mechanisms adopted by extremophiles.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Alkalis in Orchestrating Uranyl&#8208;Peroxide Reactivity Leading to Direct Air Capture of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spectator ions have known and emerging roles in aqueous metal&#8208;cation chemistry, respectively directing solubility, speciation, and reactivity. Here, we isolate and structurally characterize the last two metastable members of the alkali uranyl triperoxide series, the Rb+ and Cs+ salts (Cs&#8208;U1 and Rb&#8208;U1). We document their rapid solution polymerization via small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, which is compared to the more stable Li+, Na+ and K+ analogues. To understand the role of the alkalis, we also quantify alkali&#8208;hydroxide promoted peroxide deprotonation and decomposition, which generally exhibits increasing reactivity with increasing alkali size. Cs&#8208;U1, the most unstable of the uranyl triperoxide monomers, undergoes ambient direct air capture of CO2 in the solid&#8208;state, converting to Cs4[UVIO2(CO3)3], evidenced by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. We have attempted to benchmark the evolution of Cs&#8208;U1 to uranyl tricarbonate, which involves a transient, unstable hygroscopic solid that contains predominantly pentavalent uranium, quantified by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction suggests this intermediate state contains a hydrous derivative of CsUVO3, where the parent phase has been computationally predicted, but not yet synthesized.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances Toward Amphidinolides C, F and U: Isolations, Synthetic Studies and Total Syntheses</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphidinolides C, F and U are a sub&#8208;class of polyketides sharing a similar structure, isolated from dinoflagellates or octocoral sponges and exhibiting high cytotoxic activity. This review discloses the progress made in their isolations and structural determinations and the various synthetic approaches and successful attempts leading to their total syntheses.







Abstract
Amphidinolides C, F, and U, including C2&#8208;C4 analogs, are highly cytotoxic marine macrolides, mainly isolated from dinoflagellates of the genus Amphidinium. All these polyketides share a 75&#8201;% or more similar structure, highlighted by a macrolactone ring, at least one trans&#8208;2,5&#8208;substituted&#8208;THF motif and a characteristic polyenic side chain. From their isolation and absolute configurational assignment, the total synthesis of these marine macrolides represented an intense challenge to the organic synthesis community over the last 15&#8197;years, with around 14 research groups engaged in this inspiring task. In the first part of this review, we present the different approaches to the isolation and characterization of these natural products, including the most recent analogs, which may cast doubt on the biogenetic origin of these compounds. The various synthetic approaches to the total synthesis of C, F, and U amphidinolides are presented in a second part, focusing on key reactions and/or innovative strategies. The review concludes in a third section summarizing the successful approaches leading to the total synthesis of one of the members of this amphidinolide subfamily.

         <title>Tuning the Liquid Crystallinity and Electroluminescence via Sulfonation of S&#8208;Annulated Perylene Tetraester</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Tuning of liquid crystallinity, fluorescence and electroluminescence by molecular design.







Abstract
This study presents a comparative analysis of S&#8208;annulated perylene tetraester (PTE&#8208;S) and its sulfone (PTE&#8208;SO2) analogue. This sulfone modification reduced melting point and stabilized a room temperature columnar rectangular (Colr) phase in contrast to its parent PTE&#8208;S which showed a crystalline behaviour at room temperature. This molecular design also leads to red&#8208;shifted absorbance and emission in comparison to PTE&#8208;S, along with a tuning of photoluminescence from sky blue to green, achieving an impressive quantum yield of 85&#8201;%. OLED devices fabricated using PTE&#8208;SO2 as emitter material at concentrations of 0.2, 0.5, and 1&#8197;wt.% in CBP as host material. A maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 2.9&#8201;% was observed with the 0.5&#8197;wt.% PTE&#8208;SO2 in CBP with CIE coordinates of (0.45, 0.35), accompanied by an orange luminance of 848 cd/m2. Notably, a device with a 0.5&#8197;wt% doping concentration of PTE&#8208;S demonstrates an EQE of 3.5&#8201;%, and cyan luminance of 2,598 cd/m2.

         <title>Photocatalytic, Oxidative Cleavage of C&#8722;C Bond in Lignin Models and Native Lignin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic strategy is developed for oxidative cleavage of C&#8722;C bond in lignin models and natural lignin at room temperature. This strategy exhibits several advantages, such as aerobic environment, abundant and inexpensive chloride salts, facile generation of chlorine radical in the presence of organocatalyst, thus representing a significant advancement in the valorization of lignin into highly value&#8208;added aromatic products.







Abstract
It is challenging to realize the selective C&#8722;C bond cleavage of lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkages for production of high&#8208;value aromatic chemicals due to its intrinsic inertness and complex structure. Here we report a light&#8208;driven, chlorine&#8208;radical&#8208;based protocol to realize the oxidative C&#8722;C bond cleavage in various lignin model compounds catalyzed by commercially available TPT and CaCl2, achieving high conversion and good to high product yields at room temperature. Mechanistic studies reveal that the preferential activation of C&#946;&#8722;H bond facilitates the oxidation and C&#8722;C bond cleavage of lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model via chlorine radical. Furthermore, this method is also applicable to the depolymerization of natural lignin extracts, furnishing the aromatic oxygenates from the cleavage of C&#945;&#8722;C&#946; bonds. This study provides experimental foundations to the depolymerization and valorization of lignin into high value&#8208;added aromatic compounds.

         <title>Scope and limitations of using microemulsions for the covalent patterning of graphene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Patterning of graphene (functionalizing some areas while leaving others intact) is challenging, as all the C atoms in the basal plane are identical, but it is also desirable for a variety of applications, like opening a bandgap in the electronic structure of graphene. Several methods have been reported to pattern graphene, but most of them are very technologically intensive. Recently, we reported the use of microemulsions as templates to pattern graphene at the &#181;m scale. This method is very simple and in principle tunable, as emulsions of different droplet size and composition can be prepared easily. Here, we explore in detail the scope of this methodology by applying it to all the combinations of four different emulsions and three different organic reagents, and characterizing the resulting substrates exhaustively through Raman, SEM and AFM. We find that the method is general, works better when the reactive species are outside the micelles, and requires reactive species that involve short reaction times.</dc:description>

         <title>Incorporation of Carboxylate Pendant Arms into 18&#8208;Membered Macrocycles: Effects on [nat/203Pb]Pb(II) Complexation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a detailed investigation on the coordination chemistry of [nat/203Pb]Pb(II) with chelators H4PYTA and H4CHX&#8208;PYTA. These chelators belong to the family of ligands derived from the 18&#8208;membered macrocyclic backbone PYAN and present varying degrees of rigidity due to the presence of either ethyl or cyclohexyl spacers. A complete study of the stable Pb(II) complexes is carried out via NMR, X&#8208;Ray crystallography, stability constant determination and computational studies. While these studies indicated that Pb(II) complexation is achieved, and the thermodynamic stability of the resulting complexes is very high, a certain degree of fluxionality does exist in both cases. Nevertheless, radiolabeling studies were carried out using SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) compatible isotope lead&#8208;203 (203Pb, t1/2 = 51.9 h), and while both chelators complex the radioisotope, the incorporation of carboxylate pendant arms appears to be detrimental towards the stability of the complexes when compared to the previously described amide analogues. Additionally, incorporation of a cyclohexyl spacer does not improve the kinetic inertness of the system.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging Halogen Interactions for a Supramolecular Nanotube</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate the formation of supramolecular nanotubes from molecular triangles in a single crystal by balancing the hydrogen bonds and halogen interactions between individual macrocycles. Thereby, we template the supramolecular nanotube growth by intermolecular interactions encoded directly in the macrocycles instead of those provided by the crystallization solvent. Ultimately, we show that replacing bromines for iodines in the macrocycle is necessary to achieve this supramolecular organization by enhancing the strength of the halogen interactions and concomitant reduction of the detrimental hydrogen bonds. We investigated the nature and the interplay of the individual intermolecular interactions by analysis of the experimental single crystal data and quantum chemical calculations. This work enriches the available toolbox of interactions to construct supramolecular nanotubes, and will aid and abet the development of rationally&#8208;designed materials with a long&#8208;range 1D organization.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ Diazonium Salt Formation and Photochemical Aryl&#8208;Aryl Coupling in Continuous Flow monitored by Inline NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel class of diazonium salts is introduced for the photochemical aryl&#8208;aryl coupling to produce (substituted) biphenyls. As common diazonium tetrafluoroborate salts fail, soluble and safe aryl diazonium trifluoroacetates are applied. In this mild synthesis route no catalysts are required to generate an aryl&#8208;radical by irradiation with UV&#8208;A light (365 nm). This reactive species undergoes direct C&#8208;H arylation at an arene, forming the product in reasonable reaction times. With the implementation of a continuous flow setup in a capillary photoreactor 13 different biphenyl derivatives are successfully synthesized. By integrating an inline 19F&#8208;NMR benchtop spectrometer, samples are reliably quantified as the fluorine&#8208;substituents act as a probe. Here, real&#8208;time NMR spectroscopy is a perfect tool to monitor the continuously operated system, which produces fine chemicals of industrial relevance even in a multigram scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Controllable Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence: State of the Art</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 14, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The text for Table of Contents: Dynamic persistent luminescence would endow optoelectronic devices with revolutionary performance. In this concept, we have highlighted the recent progress in the photo&#8208;switchable room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) of a series of materials and their potential applications. We also provided a perspective on the future challenges and opportunities for the materials with dynamic phosphorescence.







Abstract
In this concept, we showcase the upsurge in the studies of dynamic ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials containing inorganic and/or organic components as versatile photo&#8208;responsive platforms. The goal is to provide a comprehensive analysis of photo&#8208;controllable RTP, and meanwhile delve into the underlying RTP properties of various classes of photochromic materials including metal&#8208;organic complexes, organic&#8208;inorganic co&#8208;crystals, purely organic small molecules and organic polymers. In particular, the design principles governing the integration of the photochromic and RTP moieties within a single material system, and the tuning of dynamic RTP in response to light are emphasized. As such, this concept sheds light on the challenges and opportunities of using these tunable RTP materials for potential applications in optoelectronics, particularly highlighting their use of reversible information encryption, erasable light printing and rewritable smart paper.

         <title>A Functional Electrolyte Containing P&#8208;Phenyl Diisothiocyanate (PDITC) Additive Achieves the Interphase Stability of High Nickel Cathode in a Wide Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 14, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduction of P&#8208;phenyl diisothiocyanate (PDITC) additive improves the stability of electrode material in the NCM811/graphite batteries over a wide temperature range. Current data indicate heightened capacity retention compared to standard electrolytes. PDITC showcases potential as an influential additive for NCM811/graphite batteries under the condition of a wide temperature range.







Abstract
The lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with high nickel cathode have high specific energy, but as the nickel content in the cathode active material increases, batteries are suffering from temperature limitations, unstable performance, and transition metal dissolution during long cycling. In this work, a functional electrolyte with P&#8208;phenyl diisothiocyanate (PDITC) additive is developed to stabilize the performance of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811)/graphite LIBs over a wide temperature range. Compared to the batteries without the additive, the capacity retention of the batteries with PDITC&#8208;containing electrolyte increases from 23&#8201;% to 74&#8201;% after 1400 cycles at 25&#8201;&#176;C, and from 15&#8201;% to 85&#8201;% after 300 cycles at 45&#8201;&#176;C. After being stored at 60&#8201;&#176;C, the capacity retention rate and capacity recovery rate of the battery are also improved. In addition, the PDITC&#8208;containing battery has a higher discharge capacity at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, and the capacity retention rate increases from 79&#8201;% to 90&#8201;% after 500 cycles at 0&#8201;&#176;C. Both theoretical calculations and spectroscopic results demonstrate that PDITC is involved in constructing a dense interphase, inhibiting the decomposition of the electrolyte and reducing the interfacial impedance. The application of PDITC provides a new strategy to improve the wide&#8208;temperature performance of the NCM811/graphite LIBs.

Compound 1 displayed superior catalytic performance in the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde (yield=94&#8201;%; turnover number=500; turnover frequency=20.8&#8197;h&#8722;1).







Abstract
An unclassical structure of {Ru(C6H6)}&#8208;based polyoxometalate, Cs6H4[Te2Mo12O46{Ru(C6H6)}]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;16.5H2O (1), has been successfully constructed from {Te2Mo12O46}&#8208;type heteropolymolybdate and {Ru(C6H6)} group, which structure type was discovered for the first time. Compound 1 not only possesses strong light&#8208;harvesting ability, but also exhibits high carrier separation efficiency and lower charge transfer resistance. Under visible light irradiation, compound 1 displayed excellent catalytic activity and circularity in the conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde (yield=94&#8201;%; turnover number=500; turnover frequency=20.8&#8197;h&#8722;1). Finally, the electron paramagnetic resonance measurement and energy level matching analysis provide theoretical basis for the derivation of the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Organic Polar Crystals, Second Harmonic Generation, and Piezoelectric Effects from Heteroadamantanes in the Space Group R3m</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 14, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
7&#8208;halo&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazaadamantanes with halo=chloro, bromo form polar crystals from solution, exhibiting non&#8208;linear optical and piezoelectric effects. The chloro compound and the bromo compound form substitutional solid solutions.







Abstract
Polar crystalline materials, a subset of the non&#8208;centrosymmetric materials, are highly sought after. Their symmetry properties make them pyroelectric and also piezoelectric and capable of second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG). For SHG and piezoelectric applications, metal oxides are commonly used. The advantages of oxides are durability and hardness &#8211; downsides are the need for high&#8208;temperature synthesis/processing and often the need to include toxic metals. Organic polar crystals, on the other hand, can avoid toxic metals and can be amenable to solution&#8208;state processing. While the vast majority of polar organic molecules crystallize in non&#8208;polar space groups, we found that both 7&#8208;chloro&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazaadamantane, for short Cl&#8208;TAA, and also the related Br&#8208;TAA (but not I&#8208;TAA) form polar crystals in the space group R3m, easily obtained from dichloromethane solution. Measurements confirm piezoelectric and SHG properties for Cl&#8208;TAA and Br&#8208;TAA. When the two species are crystallized together, solid solutions form, suggesting that properties of future materials can be tuned continuously.

Compound 1 contains an unusual SiII&#8722;SiIV&#8722;SiII bonding arrangement with SiII&#8722;SiIV bond lengths of 2.4212(8) and 2.4157(7)&#8197;&#197;. Treatment of 1 with Fe(CO)5 afforded a dinuclear Fe0 complex 2 with two unusually long Si&#8722;Si bonds (2.4515(8) and 2.4488(10)&#8197;&#197;). NBO and EDA&#8208;NOCV analyses reveal that the Si&#8722;Si bonds in 1 and 2 are of an electron&#8208;sharing nature.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of a rare bis&#8208;silylene, 1, in which two SiIIatoms are bridged by a SiIV atom. Compound 1 contains an unusual SiII&#8722;SiIV&#8722;SiII bonding arrangement with SiII&#8722;SiIV bond distances of 2.4212(8) and 2.4157(7)&#8197;&#197;. Treatment of 1 with Fe(CO)5 afforded a dinuclear Fe0 complex 2 with two unusually long Si&#8722;Si bonds (2.4515(8) and 2.4488(10)&#8197;&#197;). We have also carried out a detailed computational study to understand the nature of the Si&#8722;Si bonds in these compounds. Natural bond orbital (NBO) and energy decomposition analysis&#8211;natural orbital for chemical valence (EDA&#8208;NOCV) analyses reveal that the Si&#8722;Si bonds in 1 and 2 are of an electron&#8208;sharing nature.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Protein Conjugation by a Multicomponent Ugi Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 14, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thorough methodology work on the Ugi multicomponent reaction applied to the conjugation of native proteins highlighted key reaction conditions and reagents for the development of a highly site&#8208;selective procedure.







Abstract
The chemical bioconjugation of proteins has seen tremendous applications in the past decades, with the booming of antibody&#8208;drug conjugates and their use in oncology. While genetic engineering has permitted to produce bespoke proteins featuring key (un&#8722;)natural amino acid residues poised for site&#8208;selective modifications, the conjugation of native proteins is riddled with selectivity issues. Chemoselective strategies are plentiful and enable the precise modification of virtually any residue with a reactive side&#8208;chain; site&#8208;selective methods are less common and usually most effective on small and medium&#8208;sized proteins. In this context, we studied the application of the Ugi multicomponent reaction for the site&#8208;selective conjugation of amine and carboxylate groups on proteins, and antibodies in particular. Through an in&#8208;depth mechanistic methodology work supported by peptide mapping studies, we managed to develop a set of conditions allowing the highly selective modification of antibodies bearing N&#8208;terminal glutamate and aspartate residues. We demonstrated that this strategy did not alter their affinity toward their target antigen and produced an antibody&#8208;drug conjugate with subnanomolar potency. Excitingly, we showed that the high site selectivity of our strategy was maintained on other protein formats, especially on anticalins, for which directed mutagenesis helped to highlight the key importance of a single lysine residue.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Dependent Electrochemical Performance of Ta&#8208;Substituted SrCoO3 Perovskite for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 14, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hybrid supercapacitor SrCo0.95Ta0.05O3&#8208;&#948;@CC//AC@CC exhibits a high capacitance property and stable long&#8208;term cycle life, and can be used as a wide temperature&#8208;tolerant supercapacitor with a withstand temperature range of 25~85&#8201;&#176;C. The outstanding electrochemical results present that SrCo1&#8208;xTaxO3&#8208;&#948; perovskite holds good prospects for hybrid supercapacitors with wide temperature&#8208;tolerance.







Abstract
Developing new electrode materials with good temperature&#8208;dependent electrochemical performance has become a great issue for the deployment of hybrid supercapacitors with wide temperature tolerance. In this work, a series of Ta&#8208;substituted SrCo1&#8208;xTaxO3&#8208;&#948; (x=0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20) perovskites have been studied as positive electrodes for hybrid supercapacitors in terms of their structures, elemental valence states and electrochemical performances. Incorporating Ta into SrCoO3&#8208;&#948; perovskite not only stabilizes the crystallite structure but also notably improves electrochemical activities. The SrCo0.95Ta0.05O3&#8208;&#948;@CC delivers the highest specific capacity (Qsp) of 227.91&#8197;C g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A g&#8722;1, which is attributed to the highest oxygen vacancy content and the fastest oxygen diffusion kinetics. The hybrid supercapacitor SrCo0.95Ta0.05O3&#8208;&#948;@CC//AC@CC exhibits a high energy density of 22.82&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1@775.09&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and a stable long&#8208;term cycle life (5000 cycles) with 90.7&#8201;% capacity retention. As temperature increases from 25 to 85&#8201;&#176;C, the capacitance properties are improved at elevated temperatures for both electrode and device due to the increased electrolyte conductivity. The outstanding electrochemical results present that SrCo1&#8208;xTaxO3&#8208;&#948; perovskite holds good prospects for hybrid supercapacitors with wide temperature tolerance.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Visible&#8208;Light Induced Oxidative Cleavage of C(sp3)&#8722;C, and C(sp3)&#8722;N Bonds of Nitriles, Alcohols, and Amines</title>

This work presents a visible&#8208;light mediated oxidative cleavage of unstrained C&#8722;C(sp3) and C&#8722;N(sp3) bonds of nitriles, alcohols (diols), and amines using Acr+&#8208;Mes/Selectfluor/DMAP system and O2 as the oxidant.







Abstract
Selective cleavage of unstrained (sp3) C&#8722;C/ C&#8722;N bonds under mild conditions is highly challenging due to the higher bond dissociation energy. A visible light mediated metal&#8208;free oxidative dehomologation of aryl acetonitriles, primary alcohols and diols to carboxylic acids via organophotocatalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;CN, C(sp3)&#8722;C(OH) bond cleavage is reported. Notably, this methodology was further extended towards selective synthesis of aldehydes via deamination of both primary as well as secondary amines. This mild protocol features wide array of substrate variation with excellent functional group tolerance, preparative&#8208;scale synthesis, and operational simplicity. Possible mechanisms for these transformations were demonstrated through a series of control experiments.

         <title>Electrochemical Redox Conversion of Formate to CO via Coupling Fe&#8722;Co Layered Double Hydroxides and Au Catalysts</title>

Although formate is an inactive molecule which cannot be further reduced, this work provides a redox chemistry route for converting formate into active CO through a coupled slit parallel&#8208;plate electrode system.







Abstract
Formate has been considered an inactive molecule and thus cannot be further reduced under CO2 reduction conditions, which limits its widespread application as feedstock. Here we present an electrochemical redox conversion of formate to CO through the potential&#8208;dependent generation of carbon dioxide radical anions (CO2&#8901;&#8722;) on Fe&#8722;Co layered double hydroxides (Fe&#8722;Co LDHs) and the subsequent reduction of CO2&#8901;&#8722; to CO on Au catalysts. We present an electrodeposition protocol for the synthesis of Fe&#8722;Co LDHs with precise composition control and find that Fe1Co4 exhibits a promising potential window for CO2&#8901;&#8722; formation between 1.14 and 1.4&#8197;V and an optimized potential at 1.24&#8197;V at a neutral pH condition. We further determined the formation of CO2&#8901;&#8722; at 1.24&#8197;V via electron paramagnetic resonance and CO2 at &gt;1.4&#8197;V through differential electrochemical mass spectrometry. This work provides a redox chemistry route for converting formate into CO through a coupled slit parallel&#8208;plate electrode system.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Bonds in the Ebselen Class of Antioxidants Probed by X&#8208;ray Quantum Crystallography</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 14, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
X&#8208;ray wavefunctions reveal that the nature of Se&#8722;N bonds in ebselen class of antioxidants is akin to dynamic bonds, with electronic features intermediary to covalent and ionic bonds.







Abstract
Dynamic bonds are essential structural ingredients of dynamic covalent chemistry that involve reversible cleavage and formation of bonds. Herein, we explore the electronic characteristics of Se&#8722;N bonds in the organo&#8208;selenium antioxidant ebselen and its derivatives for their propensity to function as dynamic covalent bonds by employing high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray quantum crystallography and complementary computational studies. An analysis of the experimentally reconstructed X&#8208;ray wavefunctions reveals the salient electronic features of the Se&#8722;N bonds with very low electron density localized at the bonding region and a positive Laplacian value at the bond critical point. Bond orders and percentage covalency and ionicity estimated from the X&#8208;ray wavefunctions, along with localized orbital locator (LOL) and electron localization function (ELF) analyses show that the Se&#8722;N bond is unique in its closed shell&#8208;like features, despite being a covalent bond. Time&#8208;dependent DFT calculations simulate the cleavage of Se&#8722;N bonds in ebselen in the excited state, further substantiating their nature as dynamic bonds.

A manganese&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling of glycerol with amines for the synthesis of substituted 2&#8208;methylquinoxalines, 2&#8208;ethylbenzimidazoles, and &#945;&#8208;aminoketones was reported. NHC&#8208;based pincer manganese complex featuring a pyridine backbone displayed high catalytic activity and selectivity. No external oxidants were used in these reactions and hydrogen and water were produced as the only by&#8208;products.







Abstract
Glycerol is one of the important biomass&#8208;derived feedstocks and the high&#8208;value utilizations of glycerol have attracted much attentions in recent years. Herein, we report a manganese catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling of glycerol with amines for the synthesis of substituted 2&#8208;methylquinoxalines, 2&#8208;ethylbenzimidazoles, and &#945;&#8208;aminoketones without any external oxidant. In these reactions, NHC&#8208;based pincer manganese complex featuring a pyridine backbone displayed high catalytic activity and selectivity, in which hydrogen and water were produced as the only by&#8208;products using glycerol as a C3 synthon.

A versatile method for the automated synthesis of composites containing DNA&#8208;oligonucleotides and boron cluster scaffolds and their assembly into functional nanoparticles is described. The torus&#8208;like nanostructures carry antisense oligonucleotides that target two different oncogenes and act as dual&#8208;action agents silencing two oncogenes EGFR and c&#8208;Myc simultaneously. The system can be readily adapted to target other biological components.







Abstract
A versatile method for the automated synthesis of composites containing DNA&#8208;oligonucleotides and boron cluster scaffolds and their assembly into functional nanoparticles is described. The obtained, torus&#8208;like nanoparticles carry antisense oligonucleotides that target two different oncogenes simultaneously. The nanoparticles exhibited notable silencing efficiency in&#8197;vitro in a pancreatic carcinoma cell line PANC&#8208;1 toward EGFR and c&#8208;Myc genes at the mRNA level, and a significant efficiency at the protein level. The proposed approach may be an attractive alternative to methods currently used, including one therapeutic nucleic acid, one genetic target, or the use of cocktails of therapeutic nucleic acids.

         <title>Boosting Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Alkyl&#8208;Locked Axial Chirality Scaffold by Restriction of Molecular Motions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 14, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is powerfully effective to boosting circularly polarized luminescence by the synergistic strategy that increases the intramolecular rigidity by reducing the chain length of alkylated axial scaffold and enhances the intermolecular interactions to restrict the intermolecular motions. Unusual and significant amplification of dissymmetry factor |glum| from 10&#8722;4 to 10&#8722;1 level was achieved in organic CPL system.







Abstract
Boosting the circularly polarized luminescence of small organic molecules has been a stubborn challenge because of weak structure rigidity and dynamic molecular motions. To investigate and eliminate these factors, here, we carried out the structure&#8208;property relationship studies on a newly&#8208;developed axial chiral scaffold of bidibenzo[b,d]furan. The molecular rigidity was finely tuned by gradually reducing the alkyl&#8208;chain length. The environmental factors were considered in solution, crystal, and polymer matrix at different temperatures. As a result, a significant amplification of the dissymmetry factor glum from 10&#8722;4 to 10&#8722;1 was achieved, corresponding to the situation from (R)&#8208;4C in solution to (R)&#8208;1C in polymer film at room temperature. A synergistic strategy of increasing the intramolecular rigidity and enhancing the intermolecular interaction to restrict the molecular motions was thus proposed to improve circularly polarized luminescence. The though&#8208;out demonstrated relationship will be of great importance for the development of high&#8208;performance small organic chiroptical systems in the future.

         <title>The Phosphidosilicates AE2Li4SiP4 (AE=Ca, Sr, Eu) Ba4Li16Si3P12</title>

The new quaternary phosphidosilicates AE2Li4SiP4 (AE=Ca, Sr, Eu) and Ba4Li16Si3P12 contain so far unknown structural motifs with lithium in octahedral and tetrahedral coordination by phosphorus







Abstract
The quaternary phosphidosilicates AE2Li4SiP4 (AE=Ca, Sr, Eu) and Ba4Li16Si3P12 were synthesized by heating the elements and Li3P under argon atmosphere. Their crystal structures were determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. AE2Li4SiP4 crystallize in a new layered structure type (P21/m, Z=2) with CdI2&#8208;analoguos layers. Edge sharing CaP6 octahedra are separated by layers of vertex&#8208;sharing SiP4 and LiP4 tetrahedra, which contain additional chains of LiP6 octahedra. Ba4Li16Si3P12 forms likewise a new structure type (P21/c, Z=16) with a three&#8208;dimensional network of SiP4, Si2P6 and LiP4 entities as well as one phosphorus site not bonded to silicon. Barium is located in capped trigonal prisms of phosphorus which form strongly corrugated layers. 31P and 29Si solid&#8208;state NMR spectra confirm the crystal structures of the compounds AE2Li4SiP4. 7Li spectra show only one signal in spite of quite different crystallographic positions, which indicate possible Li+ mobility. However, this signal is much broader compared to the known Li+ conducting phosphidosilicates. Accordingly, electrochemical impedance measurements show low Li+ conductivities.

         <title>Orbital Analysis Captures the Existence of a Mixed&#8208;Valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII Active&#8208;Site and its Role in Water&#8208;Assisted Aliphatic Hydroxylation</title>

Our computations reveal that the mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core is formed via the transfer of 2H+ and 2e&#8722; from the phenolic groups of the ligands to peroxo&#8208;dicopper core. This mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII is highly reactive towards the aliphatic C&#8722;H bond following a hydrogen atom transfer mechanism. Further, the role of an in&#8208;situ generated water molecule in aliphatic C&#8722;H hydroxylation was also analysed.







Abstract
The Cu&#8722;O&#8722;Cu core has been proposed as a potential site for methane oxidation in particulate methane monooxygenase. In this work, we used density functional theory (DFT) to design a mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII species from an experimentally known peroxo&#8208;dicopper complex supported by N&#8208;donor ligands containing phenolic groups. We found that the transfer of two&#8208;protons and two&#8208;electrons from phenolic groups to peroxo&#8208;dicopper core takes place, which results to the formation of a bis&#8208;&#956;&#8208;hydroxo&#8208;dicopper core. The bis&#8208;&#956;&#8208;hydroxo&#8208;dicopper core converts to a mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core with the removal of a water molecule. The orbital and spin density analyses unravel the mixed&#8208;valent nature of CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII. We further investigated the reactivity of this mixed&#8208;valent core for aliphatic C&#8722;H hydroxylation. Our study unveiled that mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core follows a hydrogen atom transfer mechanism for C&#8722;H activation. An in&#8208;situ generated water molecule plays an important role in C&#8722;H hydroxylation by acting as a proton transfer bridge between carbon and oxygen. Furthermore, to assess the relevance of a mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core, we investigated aliphatic C&#8722;H activation by a symmetrical CuII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core. DFT results show that the mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core is more reactive toward the C&#8722;H bond than the symmetrical CuII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core.

         <title>Tuning the Topology of Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks through Site&#8208;Selective Synthetic Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 14, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
On the basis of the site&#8208;selective synthetic strategy, a clover&#8208;like COF with free amine groups (NH2&#8722;Ah&#8722;Tz) and a honeycomb&#8208;like COF without amine groups (Ah&#8722;Tz) were synthesized by simply adjusting the molar ratio of the monomers. Remarkably, NH2&#8722;Ah&#8722;Tz displayed significantly enhanced adsorption capacities toward crystal violet and congo red compared to the non&#8208;functionalized Ah&#8722;Tz.







Abstract
Tuning the topology of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is of paramount scientific interest but remains largely unexplored. Herein, we present a site&#8208;selective synthetic strategy that enables the tuning of 2D COF topology by simply adjusting the molar ratio of an amine&#8208;functionalized dihydrazide monomer (NH2&#8722;Ah) and 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triyl)tribenzaldehyde (Tz). This approach resulted in the formation of two distinct COFs: a clover&#8208;like 2D COF with free amine groups (NH2&#8722;Ah&#8722;Tz) and a honeycomb&#8208;like COF without amine groups (Ah&#8722;Tz). Both COFs exhibited good crystallinity and moderate porosity. Remarkably, the clover&#8208;shaped NH2&#8722;Ah&#8722;Tz COF, with abundant free amine groups, displayed significantly enhanced adsorption capacities toward crystal violet (CV, 261&#8197;mg/g) and congo red (CR, 1560&#8197;mg/g) compared to the non&#8208;functionalized honeycomb&#8208;like Ah&#8722;Tz COF (123&#8197;mg/g for CV and 1340&#8197;mg/g for CR), underscoring the pivotal role of free amine functional groups in enhancing adsorption capacities for organic dyes. This work highlights that the site&#8208;selective synthetic strategy paves a new avenue for manipulating 2D COF topology by adjusting the monomer feeding ratio, thereby modulating their adsorption performances toward organic dyes.

         <title>Radiolabelled 177Lu&#8208;Bispidine&#8208;Trastuzumab for Targeting Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Positive Cancers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 14, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the synthesis and assess the in&#8197;vivo performance of a nonadentate bispidine ligand for 177Lu3+ ion complexation. Photoconjugation methods to proteins including the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab produced viable 177Lu&#8208;radiotracers for targeting the human epidermal growth&#8208;factor receptor HER2 in relevant mouse models of human ovarian cancer. Bispidines are a promising scaffold for developing chelates with high denticity.







Abstract
Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) is a promising alternative to conventional treatment options. Here, we present experimental work on the synthesis, radiochemistry, and in&#8197;vivo performance of a lanthanoid&#8208;selective nonadentate bispidine ligand suitable for 177Lu3+ ion complexation. The ligand (bisp,1) was derivatised with a photoactivatable aryl azide (ArN3) group as a bioconjugation handle for light&#8208;induced labelling of proteins. Quantitative radiosynthesis of [177Lu]Lu&#8208;1+ was accomplished in 10 minutes at 40&#8201;&#176;C. Subsequent incubation of [177Lu]Lu&#8208;1+ with trastuzumab, followed by irradiation with light at 365&#8197;nm for 15&#8197;min, at room temperature and pH&#8197;8.0&#8211;8.3, gave the radiolabelled mAb, [177Lu]Lu&#8208;1&#8208;azepin&#8208;trastuzumab ([177Lu]Lu&#8208;1&#8208;mAb) in a decay&#8208;corrected radiochemical yield of 14&#8201;%, and radiochemical purity (RCP)&gt;90&#8201;%. Stability studies and cellular binding assays in&#8197;vitro using the SK&#8208;OV&#8208;3 human ovarian cancer cells confirmed that [177Lu]Lu&#8208;1&#8208;mAb remained biological active and displayed specific binding to HER2/neu. Experiments in immunocompromised female athymic nude mice bearing subcutaneous xenograft models of SK&#8208;OV&#8208;3 tumours revealed significantly higher tumour uptake in the normal group compared with the control block group (29.8&#177;11.4&#8201;%ID g&#8722;1 vs. 14.8&#177;6.1&#8201;%ID g&#8722;1, respectively; P&#8208;value=0.037). The data indicate that bispidine&#8208;based ligand systems are suitable starting points for constructing novel, high&#8208;denticity chelators for specific complexation of larger radiotheranostic metal ion nuclides.

         <title>Thermochromic Afterglow from Benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;Diboronic Acid&#8208;Doped Co&#8208;crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 14, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The afterglow color of benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diboronic acid (BDBA)&#8208;doped co&#8208;crystals with trimethylolpropane (TMP) varied from bluish to greenish color towards an increase of temperature from &#8722;132 to 40&#8201;&#176;C. Based on the photophysical properties of co&#8208;crystals and TD&#8208;DFT calculations, the molecular distortions at the singlet excited states enhanced the spin&#8208;orbit coupling to improve the intersystem crossing rate of BDBA ester.







Abstract
The accurate thermosensing requires a minimum impact of autofluorescence and light scattering from the samples. In this study, we discovered that commercially available benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diboronic acid (BDBA) doped co&#8208;crystals with trimethylolpropane (TMP) exhibit excellent thermochromic dual phosphorescence properties over a wide temperature range from &#8722;132 to 40&#8201;&#176;C, despite its simple structure that does not have any donor&#8208;acceptor linkage. The dual phosphorescence was consisted of monomeric benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diboronate (BDBA ester) and aggregation&#8208;stabilized species. With an increase in temperature, the emission intensity from the monomeric state significantly decreased, whereas that originating from the aggregated state remained almost constant owing to the difference in their thermal stabilities. Further investigation revealed that molecular distortions in singlet excited states enable efficient intersystem crossing, causing efficient phosphorescence from the monomeric state of BDBA ester.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Sulfimidation in Aqueous Media: a Fast, Chemoselective and Biomolecule&#8208;Compatible Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 14, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The excellent nitrene transfer reactivity of the copper complexes investigated in this study could be an interesting starting point to unlock nitrene transfer catalysis in&#8197;vivo. The copper&#8208;catalyzed sulfimidation of thioethers in aqueous media proceeds with high chemoselectivity and good biomolecule compatibility within short reaction times, meeting the fitness factors associated with developing new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reactions for future in&#8197;vivo application.







Abstract
Performing transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions in cells and living systems has equipped scientists with a toolbox to study biological processes and release drugs on demand. Thus far, an impressive scope of reactions has been performed in these settings, but many are yet to be introduced. Nitrene transfer presents a rather unexplored new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reaction. The reaction products are frequently encountered motifs in pharmaceuticals, presenting opportunities for the controlled, intracellular synthesis of drugs. Hence, we explored the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed sulfimidation reaction in water for future in&#8197;vivo application. Two Cu(I) complexes containing trispyrazolylborate ligands (Tpx) were selected, and the catalytic system was evaluated with the aid of three fitness factors. The excellent nitrene transfer reactivity and high chemoselectivity of the catalysts, coupled with good biomolecule compatibility, successfully enabled the sulfimidation of thioethers in aqueous media. We envision that this copper&#8208;catalyzed sulfimidation reaction could be an interesting starting point to unlock the potential of nitrene transfer catalysis in&#8197;vivo.

         <title>CBr4 as a Mild Oxidant&#8208;Enabled Oxidation of a sp3 C&#8722;H Bond: A Facile Synthesis of the Persistent Iminium Salts of Tetrahydroisoquinolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 14, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A C&#8722;H bond oxidation of THIQs was achieved by CBr4 initiated reaction conditions, providing a series of the persistent iminium salts of THIQs in high yields with good functional group tolerance. These iminium salts can be readily applied to the synthesis of the functionalized THIQ derivatives.







Abstract
Using CBr4 as a mild oxidant, the direct C&#8722;H bond oxidation of N&#8208;aryltetrahydroisoquinolines was achieved, giving a series of the corresponding iminium salts in high yields under metal&#8208; and photo&#8208;free reaction conditions. This reaction is superior in high yields and good functional group tolerance, and the late&#8208;stage derivatization showed that these iminium salts can readily be applied to the synthesis of the functionalized THIQs.

The manifestation of the &#8220;buttressing effect&#8221; &#8211; an indirect interaction between two substituents issued by the presence of a third group &#8211; and its influence on the ease and selectivity of the bromine&#8208;lithium exchange and the reactivity of formed aryllithiums is presented. In naphthalene substrates bearing two bromines, the impact on regioselectivity of the reaction is demonstrated.







Abstract
Non&#8208;covalent interactions such as coordination of an organolithium reagent by a directing group and steric repulsion of substituents strongly affect the halogen&#8208;lithium exchange process. Here we present the manifestation of the &#8220;buttressing effect&#8221; &#8211; an indirect interaction between two substituents issued by the presence of a third group &#8211; and its influence on the ease and selectivity of the bromine&#8208;lithium exchange and the reactivity of formed aryllithiums. The increase of the size of the &#8220;buttressing&#8221; substituent strongly affects the conformation of a NMe2 group, forcing it to hinder ortho&#8208;bromine and thus slowing down the exchange. In naphthalene substrates bearing two bromines, this suppresses regioselectivity of the reaction. The &#8220;buttressing effect&#8221; forces formed aryllithiums to deaggregate, thus boosting their reactivity. This facilitates the decomposition via protolisys by ethereal solvents even at low temperatures and in some cases initiates fast Wurtz&#8208;Fittig coupling.

Efficient red thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials consisting of cyano&#8208;substituted 11,12&#8208;diphenyldipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine acceptors and triphenylamine donors are reported, and the significant influence of cyano substituents on photophysical property and electroluminescence performance are elucidated. High&#8208;performance red OLEDs are achieved, providing excellent external quantum efficiencies of 28.8&#8201;% at 616&#8197;nm and 20.2&#8201;% at 648&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Red luminescent materials are essential components for full color display and white lightening based on organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) technology, but the extension of emission color towards red or deep red region generally leads to decreased photoluminescence and electroluminescence efficiencies. Herein, we wish to report two new luminescent molecules (2CNDPBPPr&#8208;TPA and 4CNDPBPPr&#8208;TPA) consisting of cyano&#8208;substituted 11,12&#8208;diphenyldipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine acceptors and triphenylamine donors. As the increase of cyano substituents, the emission wavelength is greatly red&#8208;shifted and the reverse intersystem crossing process is promoted, resulting in strong red delayed fluorescence. Meanwhile, due to the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, the molecular structures become rigidified and planarized, which brings about large horizontal dipole ratios. As a result, 2CNDPBPPr&#8208;TPA and 4CNDPBPPr&#8208;TPA can perform as emitters efficiently in OLEDs, furnishing excellent external quantum efficiencies of 28.8&#8201;% at 616&#8197;nm and 20.2&#8201;% at 648&#8197;nm, which are significantly improved in comparison with that of the control molecule without cyano substituents. The findings in this work demonstrate that the introduction of cyano substituents to the acceptors of delayed fluorescence molecules could be a facile and effective approach to explore high&#8208;efficiency red or deep red delayed fluorescence materials.

         <title>Cerium Oxide Catalyzed Disproportionation of Hydrogen Peroxide: A Closer Look at the Reaction Intermediate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 14, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study focuses on the reaction mechanism of H2O2 disproportionation by cerium oxide nanoparticles (CNP). In aqueous dispersions, H2O2 adsorption at CNP interfaces triggers the formation of stable intermediates known as cerium&#8208;peroxo complexes. The CNP catalytic reactivity is explored, showing an increase with Ce(III)&#8208;fraction and a decrease in the presence of polymer coatings, offering insights for potential nanomedicine applications.







Abstract
Cerium oxide nanoparticles (CNPs) have recently gained increasing interest as redox enzyme&#8208;mimetics to scavenge the intracellular excess of reactive oxygen species, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Despite the extensive exploration, there remains a notable discrepancy regarding the interpretation of observed redshift of UV&#8208;Visible spectroscopy due to H2O2 addition and the catalase&#8208;mimicking mechanism of CNPs. To address this question, we investigated the reaction mechanism by taking a closer look at the reaction intermediate during the catalase mimicking reaction. In this study, we present evidence demonstrating that in aqueous solutions, H2O2 adsorption at CNP surface triggers the formation of stable intermediates known as cerium&#8208;peroxo (Ce&#8208;O22&#8722;) and/or cerium&#8208;hydroperoxo (Ce&#8208;OOH&#8722;) complexes as resolved by Raman scattering and UV&#8208;Visible spectroscopy. Polymer coating presents steric hinderance for H2O2 accessibility to the solid&#8208;liquid interface limiting further intermediate formation. We demonstrate in depth that the catalytic reactivity of CNPs in the H2O2 disproportionation reaction increases with the Ce(III)&#8208;fraction and decreases in the presence of polymer coatings. The developed approach using UV&#8208;Visible spectroscopy for the characterization of the surface peroxide species can potentially serve as a foundation for determining the catalytic reactivity of CNPs in the disproportionation of H2O2.

         <title>Hydroamination of Triisopropylsilyl Acetylene Sulfur Pentafluoride &#8211; a Bench&#8208;top Route to Pentafluorosulfanylated Enamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 14, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pentafluorosulfanyl group has been proposed as a valuable addition to the toolbox of organofluorine chemistry. Here, we introduce commercially available (triisopropylsilyl)acetylene sulfur pentafluoride (TASP) as a versatile reagent that provides very low&#8208;risk access to the elusive class of &#945;&#8208;SF5 aldehyde enamines under benchtop conditions. This approach allowed these precious building blocks to be accessed and fully characterized for the first time.







Abstract
Synthetic access to a variety of aliphatic and vinylic pentafluorosulfanylated building blocks remains a major challenge in contemporary organofluorine chemistry hampering its investigation in the context of medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry and functional materials. Herein, we report a bench&#8208;top protocol to access the virtually unknown class of &#945;&#8208;SF5&#8208;enamines under mild reaction conditions in good to excellent yields (up to 95&#8201;%). This reaction combines the protodesilylation of the commercially available precursor TASP with the in&#8197;situ hydroamination of HC&#8801;C&#8722;SF5. The on&#8208;site use of highly toxic gases or corrosive reagents is avoided, making access to this motif applicable to a wide chemical audience. The excellent E&#8208;diastereoselectivity of this two&#8208;step cascade reaction is suggested to be the result of the convergence of the fast Z&#8208;/E&#8208; isomerization of a vinyl anion as well as the isomerization of the iminium ion. The remarkable thermal stability of these SF5&#8208;enamines encourages further studies of their synthetic utility.

&lt;p&gt;The pentafluorosulfanyl group has been proposed as a valuable addition to the toolbox of organofluorine chemistry. Here, we introduce commercially available (triisopropylsilyl)acetylene sulfur pentafluoride (TASP) as a versatile reagent that provides very low-risk access to the elusive class of &#945;-SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; aldehyde enamines under benchtop conditions. This approach allowed these precious building blocks to be accessed and fully characterized for the first time.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Metal Activation Produces Different Reaction Environments for Intermediates during Oxidative Addition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 14, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Widely used metal pretreatment&#8211;activation methods create different environments experienced by oxidative&#8208;addition intermediates, during the synthesis of organozinc reagents from organohalides and zinc metal. A developed fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) method reveals these differences.







Abstract
Commercial zinc metal powder requires activation for consistent and reliable use as a reductant in the formation of organozinc reagents from organohalides, and for the avoidance of supplier and batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variability. However, the impact of activation methods on the reaction environments of subsequent intermediates has been unknown. Herein, a fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) method is developed to bridge this knowledge gap, by imaging and examining reaction intermediates on zinc metal that has been activated by pretreatment through different common methods (i.&#8201;e., by chemical activation with TMSCl, dibromoethane, or HCl; or by mechanical activation). The group of chemical activating agents, previously thought to act similarly by removing oxide layers, are here shown to produce markedly different reaction environments experienced by subsequent oxidative&#8208;addition intermediates from organohalides &#8211; data uniquely available through FLIM's ability to detect small quantities of intermediates in&#8197;situ coupled with its microenvironmental sensitivity. These different microenvironments potentially give rise to different rates of formation, subsequent solubilization, and reactivity, despite the shared &#8220;[RZnX]&#8221; molecular structure of these intermediates. This information revises models for methods development for oxidative addition to currently sluggish metals beyond zinc by establishing diverse outcomes for pretreatment activation methods that were previously considered similar.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Studies on the Reactions of Aliphatic Imines with Isocyanates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 14, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of isocyanates with imines derived from allyl glycinate and differently substituted propionaldehydes was investigated. For reactions with &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dimethylated imines either 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;oxadiazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones or 2,4&#8208;dioxo&#8208;6&#8208;(aryl&#8208;/alkylthio)tetrahydro&#8208;pyrimidines were obtained as major products, which are formed via a [4+2] cycloaddition pathway. In contrast, the formation of 1,3&#8208;diazetidinones via [2+2] cycloaddition was not observed. The different reaction outcomes were rationalized by DFT calculations.







Abstract
In the context of a project aiming at the replacement of the 3&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;lactam ring in classical &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics by an N(3)&#8208;acyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;diazetidinone moiety, we have investigated the reaction of isocyanates with imines derived from allyl glycinate and differently substituted propionaldehydes. Imines of aromatic aldehydes with anilines have been reported to react with acyl isocyanates to give 1,3&#8208;diazetidinones or 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;oxadiazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones, via [2+2] or [4+2] cycloaddition, respectively. However, neither of these products was formed with imines derived from allyl glycinate and 2&#8208;(mono)methyl propionaldehydes. &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Dimethylation of the imine enabled the [4+2] cycloaddition pathway, but the desired 1,3&#8208;diazetidinone products were not observed. Surprisingly, the imines obtained from thioesters of 2,2&#8208;dimethyl 3&#8208;oxo propionic acid reacted with aryl isocyanates or with benzyl isocyanate to give 5,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,4&#8208;dioxo&#8208;6&#8208;(aryl&#8208;/alkylthio)tetrahydropyrimidines, via thiol displacement and re&#8208;addition to a putative six&#8208;membered iminium intermediate. These experimental results obtained for the reactions could be rationalized by DFT calculations. In addition, we have shown that N(3)&#8208;acyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;diazetidinone and 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;oxadiazin&#8208;4&#8208;one products can be distinguished based on experimental IR data in combination with theoretical reference spectra employing the IR spectra alignment (IRSA) algorithm. This discrimination was not possible by means of 1H, 13C, or 15N&#8197;NMR spectroscopy

         <title>Dansylated Nitrile N&#8208;Oxide as the Fluorescent Dye Clickable to Unsaturated Bonds without Catalyst</title>

Fluorescent polymeric materials have been exploited in the various research fields. However, the covalent immobilization of fluorescent dye onto common polymers is not the practical preparation technique. Herein, we report the design, synthesis, click reaction, and optical properties of dansylated nitrile N&#8208;oxide (Dansyl&#8208;NO). The results indicate that Dansyl&#8208;NO serves as a fluorescent dye clickable to alkenes and alkynes.







Abstract
Fluorescent polymeric materials have been exploited in the fields of aesthetical purposes, biomedical engineering, and three&#8208;dimensional printing applications. While the fluorescent materials are prepared by the polymerization of fluorescent monomer or the blending a fluorescent dye with common polymer, the covalent immobilization of fluorescent dye onto common polymers is not the practical technique. In this paper, dansylated nitrile N&#8208;oxide (Dansyl&#8208;NO) has been designed and synthesized to be a stable nitrile N&#8208;oxide as the derivative of 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;naphthaldehyde. While Dansyl&#8208;NO shows good reactivity to an alkene and an alkyne to give fluorescent Dansyl&#8208;Ene and Dansyl&#8208;Yne, respectively, it hardly reacts to a nitrile. The results indicate that Dansyl&#8208;NO serves as a fluorescent dye clickable to alkenes and alkynes. To know the effects of solvent on the fluorescent properties, the UV&#8208;vis and fluorescence spectra of Dansyl&#8208;Ene are measured in three solvents. Dansyl&#8208;Ene shows fluorescent solvatochromism, which appears to be red&#8208;shifted along with the increase in solvent polarity. Poly(styrene&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene) directly reacts with Dansyl&#8208;NO to give fluorescent modified SB. The emission spectrum of modified SB is blue&#8208;shifted compared with that of Dansyl&#8208;Ene. The blue&#8208;shift could be possibly attributed to the presence of less polar polymer skeleton around the dansyl moieties of modified SB.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 14, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Only products resulting from [4+2] cycloaddition pathways were observed in the reactions of different isocyanates with aliphatic imines. The alternative [2+2] pathway is strongly disfavored, and the corresponding diazetidinone products were not observed. For imines incorporating a specifically located thioester group, acyl isocyanates and aryl isocyanates gave different final products. More information can be found in the Research Article by K.&#8208;H. Altmann and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202304272).

Fluorescent polymeric materials have been exploited for aesthetical purposes, biomedical engineering, and 3D&#8208;printing applications. However, the covalent immobilization of fluorescent dyes onto common polymers is not a practical preparation technique. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400092), Y. Koyama and co&#8208;workers describe the design, synthesis, click reaction, and optical properties of dansylated nitrile N&#8208;oxide (Dansyl&#8208;NO). The results indicate that Dansyl&#8208;NO serves as a fluorescent dye clickable to alkenes and alkynes.

         <title>Photoelectrocatalytic Utilization of CO2: A Big Show of Si&#8208;based Photoelectrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 14, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
There have been two pathways for PEC CO2 utilization to produce small molecule fuel and valuable chemicals, i.&#8201;e. PEC CO2 reduction and PEC CO2 fixation. The key to achieving high efficiency, yield and selectivity of PEC CO2 utilization on Si&#8208;based photoelectrodes lies in the rational design of the photoelectrode structure as well as the modulation of the composition, morphology, structure and size of the catalysts.







Abstract
CO2 is a greenhouse gas that contributes to environmental deterioration; however, it can also be utilized as an abundant C1 resource for the production of valuable chemicals. Solar&#8208;driven photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) CO2 utilization represents an advanced technology for the resourcing of CO2. The key to achieving PEC CO2 utilization lies in high&#8208;performance semiconductor photoelectrodes. Si&#8208;based photoelectrodes have attracted increasing attention in the field of PEC CO2 utilization due to their suitable band gap (1.1&#8197;eV), high carrier mobility, low cost, and abundance on Earth. There are two pathways to PEC CO2 utilization using Si&#8208;based photoelectrodes: direct reduction of CO2 into small molecule fuels and chemicals, and fixation of CO2 with organic substrates to generate high&#8208;value chemicals. The efficiency and product selectivity of PEC CO2 utilization depends on the structures of the photoelectrodes as well as the composition, morphology, and size of the catalysts. In recent years, significant and influential progress has been made in utilizing Si&#8208;based photoelectrodes for PEC CO2 utilization. This review summarizes the latest research achievements in Si&#8208;based PEC CO2 utilization, with a particular emphasis on the mechanistic understanding of CO2 reduction and fixation, which will inspire future developments in this field.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Peptidomimetics via Ugi Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 14, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent development for the construction of peptidomimetics via Ugi reactions or post&#8208;Ugi transformations. By the combination of Ugi reaction and transition metal catalysis such as gold, palladium, rhodium and copper, as well as metal&#8208;free strategies, devise linear, cyclic and polycyclic peptidomimetics are prepared in a rapid, highly efficient and step&#8208;economical manner.







Abstract
Peptidomimetics have been extensively explored in many area due to their ability to improve pharmacological qualities and interesting biological activities. Cycles could be incorporated in peptides to reduce their flexibility, often enhancing the affinity for a certain receptor. Many efforts have been made to synthesize various peptidomimetics. Among them, the Ugi reaction is a popular way for the synthesis of peptidomimetics because it provides peptide&#8208;like products. The Ugi reaction consists of the condensation of an aldehyde or ketone, a carboxylic acid, an amine, and an isocyanide usually giving a linear peptidomimetic. In order to obtain other linear, cyclic or polycyclic peptidomimetics, the acyclic products have to undergo additional transformations or cyclizations. This review covers the years from 2018&#8211;2023, regarding the synthesis of linear, cyclic and polycyclic peptidomimetics, employing Ugi reactions eventually followed by post&#8208;Ugi transformations. Organo&#8208;catalyzed reactions, base&#8208;promoted reactions, and metal&#8208;free reactions toward peptidomimetics are highlighted.

Macrocycle&#8208;based hierarchically porous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks were summarized, including the macrocycle structures, the hierarchically porous structures of the HOFs, and the applications induced by the hierarchically porous structures.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are porous crystalline materials. The pores in HOFs are usually non&#8208;covalent extrinsic pores constructed through the formation of the framework. Supramolecular macrocycles with intrinsic pores in their structures are good candidates for constructing HOFs with intrinsic pores from the macrocycles themselves, thus leading to hierarchically porous structures. Combining the macrocycle and HOFs will endow these hierarchically porous materials with enhanced properties and special functionalities. This review summarizes recent advances in macrocycle&#8208;based HOFs, including the macrocycles used for constructing HOFs, the hierarchically porous structures of the HOFs, and the applications induced by the hierarchically HOFs porous structures. This review provides insights for future research on macrocycle&#8208;based hierarchically porous HOFs and the appropriate applications of the unique structures.

         <dc:description>
Hierarchically porous COFs (HP&#8208;COFs) refers to the integration of hierarchical pore distributions, which may include micropore, mesopore and macropore within one porous system. In this article, we introduce the synthesis methods of HP&#8208;COFs, encompassing topological structure design, in&#8208;situ templating, monolithic COF synthesis, defect engineering, and crystalline self&#8208;transformation. Simultaneously, we briefly introduce the applications of HP&#8208;COFs.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high porosity have garnered considerable interest for various applications owing to their robust and customizable structure. However, conventional COFs are hindered by their narrow pore size, which poses limitations for applications such as heterogeneous catalysis and guest delivery that typically involve large molecules. The development of hierarchically porous COF (HP&#8208;COF), featuring a multi&#8208;scale aperture distribution, offers a promising solution by significantly enhancing the diffusion capacity and mass transfer for larger molecules. This review focuses on the recent advances in the synthesis strategies of HP&#8208;COF materials, including topological structure design, in&#8208;situ templating, monolithic COF synthesis, defect engineering, and crystalline self&#8208;transformation. The specific operational principles and affecting factors in the synthesis process are summarized and discussed, along with the applications of HP&#8208;COFs in heterogeneous catalysis, toxic component treatment, optoelectronics, and the biomedical field. Overall, this review builds a bridge to understand HP&#8208;COFs and provides guidance for further development of them on synthesis strategies and applications.

         <title>Size&#8208;Switchable Ru Nanoaggregates for Enhancing Phototherapy: Hyaluronidase&#8208;Triggered Disassembly to Alleviate Deep Tumor Hypoxia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of multiple bioactivated chemical reactions in&#8197;situ and receptor&#8208;mediated targeting characteristics can alleviate deep tumor tissue hypoxia for improving tumor&#8208;specific phototherapy.







Abstract
Hypoxia is a critical factor for restricting photodynamic therapy (PDT) of tumor, and it becomes increasingly severe with increasing tissue depth. Thus, the relief of deep tumor hypoxia is extremely important to improve the PDT efficacy. Herein, tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive size&#8208;switchable hyaluronic acid&#8208;hybridized Ru nanoaggregates (HA@Ru NAs) were developed via screening reaction temperature to alleviate deep tumor hypoxia for improving the tumor&#8208;specific PDT by the artful integration multiple bioactivated chemical reactions in&#8197;situ and receptor&#8208;mediated targeting (RMT). In this nanosystem, Ru NPs not only enabled HA@Ru NAs to have near infrared (NIR)&#8208;mediated photothermal/photodynamic functions, but also could catalyze endogenous H2O2 to produce O2 in&#8197;situ. More importantly, hyaluronidase (HAase) overexpressed in the TME could trigger disassembly of HA@Ru NAs via the hydrolysis of HA, offering the smart size switch capability from 60 to 15&#8197;nm for enhancing tumor penetration. Moreover, the RMT characteristics of HA ensured that HA@Ru NAs could specially enter CD44&#8208;overexpressed tumor cells, enhancing tumor&#8208;specific precision of phototherapy. Taken together these distinguishing characteristics, smart HA@Ru NAs successfully realized the relief of deep tumor hypoxia to improve the tumor&#8208;specific PDT.

         <title>Electrochemically Driven para&#8208;Selective C(sp2)&#8722;H Alkylation Enabled by Activation of Alkyl Halides without Sacrificial Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemically driven para&#8208;selective C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation of electron&#8208;deficient arenes (aryl esters, aldehydes, nitriles, and ketones) has been achieved with alkyl halides (I, Br, Cl) as a coupling partner. Under mild electrolytic conditions, a variety of alkylated arenes are obtained in one step through the formation of C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) bonds. Notably, the reaction enables the activation of alkyl halides in the absence of sacrificial anodes.







Abstract
With alkyl halides (I, Br, Cl) as a coupling partner, an electrochemically driven strategy for para&#8208;selective C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation of electron&#8208;deficient arenes (aryl esters, aldehydes, nitriles, and ketones) has been achieved to access diverse alkylated arenes in one step. The reaction enables the activation of alkyl halides in the absence of sacrificial anodes, achieving the formation of C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) bonds under mild electrolytic conditions. The utility of this protocol is reflected in high site selectivity, broad substrate scope, and scalable.

         <title>Regulation of Fluorescence and Self&#8208;assembly of a Salicylaldehyde Azine&#8208;Containing Amphiphile by Pillararene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report the regulation of fluorescence and self&#8208;assembly of a salicylaldehyde azine&#8208;containing amphiphile G by a water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene WP5 via host&#8211;guest recognition in water. The fluorescence emission property and self&#8208;assembly behavior of G can be tailored by WP5 or pH conditions. This emission regulatable system was applied in the field of information encryption, rewritable materials, and erasable ink.







Abstract
Regulation of fluorescence and self&#8208;assembly of a salicylaldehyde azine&#8208;containing amphiphile by a water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene via host&#8211;guest recognition in water was realized. The fluorescence and the self&#8208;assembled aggregates of the bola&#8208;type amphiphile G can be tailored by adding different amounts of water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene (WP5). In addition, the emission property and self&#8208;assembly behavior of G and WP5 are responsive to pH conditions. Furthermore, the fluorescence emission property of G and the regulation by WP5 or pH conditions was applied as information encryption material, rewritable paper, and erasable ink. We believe that this fluorescence regulation strategy is promising for the construction of advanced fluorescent organic materials.

         <title>One&#8211;Step Hydrothermal Synthesis of NVO Cathodes with Varied Lattice NH4+ Content: Effect on Structural Evolution and Electrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a one&#8211;step hydrothermal synthesis method to regulate the lattice NH4+ ion content in vanadium oxide materials and discover varied lattice NH4+ content could affect the structural evolution and electrochemical performance of the material, and our work will provide a new route for designing high performance vanadium oxide cathode materials in aqueous zinc ion batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries have been extensively researched due to their distinctive advantages such as low cost and high safety. Vanadium oxides are important cathode materials, however, poor cycle life caused by vanadium dissolution limits their application. Recent studies show that the lattice NH4+ in vanadium oxides can act as a pillar to enhance structural stability and play a crucial role in improving its cycling stability. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of research on the effect of the lattice NH4+ content on structural evolution and electrochemical performance. Herein, we synthesize vanadium oxides with different contents of lattice NH4+ by a one&#8208;step hydrothermal reaction. The vanadium oxides with lattice NH4+ exhibit high initial capacity, as well as good cycling stability and rate performance compared to bare vanadium oxide. Combined with electrochemical analyses, ex&#8208;situ structural characterizations, and in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction tests, we reveal that the lattice NH4+ content plays a positive role in vanadium oxides&#8242; structural stability and cation diffusion kinetics. This work presents a direction for designing high&#8211;performance vanadium cathodes for aqueous zinc ion batteries.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;H Olefination of Imidazo[1,2a] pyridine Carboxamide in Aqueous Ethanol under Oxygen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H olefinations of imidazo[1,2a] pyridine carboxamides were accomplished with greener oxygen in H2O/EtOH robust fashion. Control experimental mechanistic studies supported the formation of organometallic Pd&#8208;intermediates, which are the key elements for the success of the sustainable protocol.







Abstract
The advancement of sustainable chemistry and changes in the economy are strongly intertwined. Reaction time, cost savings, moderate temperatures, and generation of the fewest byproducts are frequently achieved by using catalytic processes. Herein, we report the C&#8722;H olefination of imidazo[1,2a] pyridine carboxamides with various acrylates in the presence of Pd (OAc)2 with O2 as the oxidant in aqueous ethanol rather than using non&#8208;ecofriendly solvents. The C&#8722;H activation features most user&#8208;friendly reaction conditions, excellent yield as well as plenty substrate scope and applicable for C&#8722;H deuteriation of the corresponding heteroarenes with D2O. Experimental mechanistic studies indicate that C&#8722;H activation step succeeded after formation of tetra coordinated square planer Pd&#8208;substrate adduct.

         <title>Development of Pyridothiophene Compounds for PET Imaging of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
47 derivatives of a potent &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregate binding pyridothiophene (asyn&#8208;44) were synthesized and screened against [3H]asyn&#8208;44 in competitive binding assays using post&#8208;mortem Parkinsons disease brain homogenates and Ki values of the most potent compounds were determined. Asyn&#8208;44 was labelled with fluorine&#8208;18 for preliminary PET imaging in rats, which showed high initial brain uptake, moderate washout, and low variability.







Abstract
Aggregated &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn) protein is a pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD). Development of positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers to image &#945;&#8208;syn aggregates has been a longstanding goal. This work explores the suitability of a pyridothiophene scaffold for &#945;&#8208;syn PET radiotracers, where 47 derivatives of a potent pyridothiophene (asyn&#8208;44; Kd=1.85&#8197;nM) were synthesized and screened against [3H]asyn&#8208;44 in competitive binding assays using post&#8208;mortem PD brain homogenates. Equilibrium inhibition constant (Ki) values of the most potent compounds were determined, of which three had Ki&#8242;s in the lower nanomolar range (12&#8211;15&#8197;nM). An autoradiography study confirmed that [3H]asyn&#8208;44 is promising for imaging brain sections from multiple system atrophy and PD donors. Fluorine&#8208;18 labelled asyn&#8208;44 was synthesized in 6&#177;2&#8201;% radiochemical yield (decay&#8208;corrected, n=5) with a molar activity of 263&#177;121 GBq/&#956;mol. Preliminary PET imaging of [18F]asyn&#8208;44 in rats showed high initial brain uptake (&gt;1.5 standardized uptake value (SUV)), moderate washout (~0.4 SUV at 60&#8197;min), and low variability. Radiometabolite analysis showed 60&#8211;80&#8201;% parent tracer in the brain after 30 and 60&#8197;mins. While [18F]asyn&#8208;44 displayed good in&#8197;vitro properties and acceptable brain uptake, troublesome radiometabolites precluded further PET imaging studies. The synthesis and in&#8197;vitro evaluation of additional pyridothiophene derivatives are underway, with the goal of attaining improved affinity and metabolic stability.

         <title>Dynamics and Coordination of a P2N2 Ligand &#8211; from Twisted Conformation to Chelation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P2N2&#8208;ligands can adopt different conformations among which the twisted form is here characterized unambiguously for the first time using SCXRD. Additionally four respective Mo and W complexes are crystallographically analyzed. The electronic structures of the complexes are compared using spectroscopic data and shown to be dominated by the metal center.







Abstract
Based on their general spacial flexibility, their Lewis and Br&#248;nsted basicity, and ability to mimic second sphere effects the 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;3,7&#8208;diphosphacyclooctane ligand family and their complexes have regained substantial scientific interest. It was now possible to structurally analyze a recently reported member of this family with p&#8208;tolyl and t&#8208;butyl substituents on P and N, respectively, (P2p&#8208;tolN2tBu). Notably, the ligand crystallizes with a &#8216;twisted&#8217; backbone. This compound is the very first of its kind to have been unambiguously characterized with regard to its chemical and molecular structure as being in this conformation. A temperature&#8208;dependent NMR study provides insight into the molecular dynamics of two isomers in solution, which are most likely also both twisted, as judged by the observed limited reactivity. Despite the in principle unfavorable conformation of the free ligand, it was successfully chelated to tungsten and molybdenum centers in mononuclear carbonyl complexes. The ligand, a derivative thereof and four new complexes were comprehensively characterized and analyzed in comparison. This includes single crystal XRD molecular structures of P2p&#8208;tolN2tBu and all four complexes. P2p&#8208;tolN2tBu, regardless of its twisted conformation, is able to coordinate to metal centers given that enough energy (heat) for a conformational change is provided.

         <title>The Resorcinarene Hexameric Capsule as a Supramolecular Photoacid to Trigger Olefin Hydroarylation in Confined Space</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under light irradiation the hexameric resorcinarene capsule increases in acidity of 8.8&#8197;log units with respect to its ground state, becoming the first example of a self&#8208;assembled supramolecular photoacid. The photoacidity of the hexameric capsule was here exploited to boost the olefin hydroarylation reactions in confined space while no reaction occurred in the absence of irradiation and/or capsule. DFT calculations strongly corroborated a mechanism in which the photoacidity of C6* plays a crucial role.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembled resorcinarene capsule C6 shows remarkable photoacidity upon light irradiation, which is here exploited to catalyze olefin hydroarylation reactions in confined space. An experimental pKa* value range of &#8722;3.3&#8211;&#8722;2.8 was estimated for the photo&#8208;excited hexameric capsule C6*, and consequently an increase in acidity of 8.8&#8197;log units was observed with respect to its ground state (pKa=5.5&#8211;6.0). This makes the hexameric capsule the first example of a self&#8208;assembled supramolecular photoacid. The photoacid C6* can catalyze hydroarylation reaction of olefins with aromatic substrates inside its cavity, while no reaction occurred between them in the absence of irradiation and/or capsule. DFT calculations corroborated a mechanism in which the photoacidity of C6* plays a crucial role in the protonation step of the aromatic substrate. A further proton transfer to olefin with a concomitant C&#8722;C bond formation and a final deprotonation step lead to product releasing.

         <title>Regulation of Electronic Structures of the Urchin&#8208;Like NiCoP/CoP Nanocatalysts for Fast Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Urchin&#8208;like NiCoP/CoP heterostructures have been developed through a three&#8208;step hydrothermal&#8208;oxidation&#8208;phosphorization synthesis process. The nano&#8208;architecture and electronic configuration can be regulated by adjusting the original Ni/Co molar ratio and the amount of phosphorus. Consequently, the optimal Ni1Co2P shows excellent performance in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane. Furthermore, by combining infrared spectroscopy and isotope kinetics experiments, a possible reaction mechanism has been proposed.







Abstract
The exploration of stable, efficient, and low&#8208;cost catalysts toward ammonia borane hydrolysis is of vital significance for the practical implementation of this hydrogen production technology. Integrating interface engineering and nano&#8208;architecture engineering is a favorable strategy to elevate catalytic performance, as it can modify the electronic structure and provide sufficient active sites simultaneously. In this work, urchin&#8208;like NiCoP/CoP heterostructures are prepared via a three&#8208;step hydrothermal&#8208;oxidation&#8208;phosphorization synthesis route. It is demonstrated that the original Ni/Co molar ratio and the amount of phosphorus are crucial for adjusting the morphology, enhancing the exposed surface area, facilitating charge transfer, and modulating the adsorption and activation of H2O molecules. Consequently, the optimal Ni1Co2P heterostructure displays remarkable catalytic properties in the hydrolysis of ammonia borane with a turnover frequency (TOF) value of 30.3&#8197;molH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;min&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;molmetal&#8722;1, a low apparent activation energy of 25.89&#8197;kJ&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1, and good stability. Furthermore, by combining infrared spectroscopy and isotope kinetics experiments, a possible mechanism for the hydrolysis of ammonia borane was proposed.

&lt;p&gt;Urchin-like NiCoP/CoP heterostructures have been developed through a three-step hydrothermal-oxidation-phosphorization synthesis process. The nano-architecture and electronic configuration can be regulated by adjusting the original Ni/Co molar ratio and the amount of phosphorus. Consequently, the optimal Ni&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P shows excellent performance in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane. Furthermore, by combining infrared spectroscopy and isotope kinetics experiments, a possible reaction mechanism has been proposed.

         <title>Stabilisation of the [SiH6]2&#8722; Anion within a Supramolecular Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bring solid state chemistry into solution. Using a supramolecular assembly to mimic the coordination environment of [SiH6]2&#8722; in the solid&#8208;state, a molecular [SiH6]2&#8722; complex that is stable in solution is reported.







Abstract
The hypercoordinate [SiH6]2&#8722; anion is not stable in solution. Here, we report the room temperature, solution stable molecular [SiH6]2&#8722; complex, [{KCa(NON)(OEt2)}2][SiH6] (NON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene)), where the [SiH6]2&#8722; anion is stabilised within a supramolecular assembly that mimics the solid&#8208;state environment of the anion in the lattice of K2SiH6. Solution&#8208;state reactivity of the complex towards carbon monoxide, benzaldehyde, azobenzene and acetonitrile is reported, yielding a range of reduction and C&#8722;C coupled products.

         <title>(Diazomethyl)dimethylphosphine Oxide &#8211; A Diazoalkane Reagent for [3+2] Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient protocol for the generation of (diazomethyl)dimethylphosphine &#8211; a novel diazoalkane reagent &#8211; based on the diazotization reaction under anhydrous conditions is described. The title compound can be prepared as ca. 1.5&#8197;M solution in chloroform and can be stored at &#8722;18&#8201;&#176;C for at least a month. The proposed reagent readily undergoes [3+2] cycloaddition with various electron&#8208;poor alkynes and alkenes providing the corresponding Me2P(O)&#8208;substituted pyrazoles and pyrazolines, respectively.







Abstract
A safe and efficient method for the in&#8208;situ preparation of (diazomethyl)dimethylphosphine oxide &#8211; a hereto unexplored diazoalkane reagent &#8211; is developed. The method is based on the diazotization of the corresponding P(O)Me2&#8208;substituted amine (readily available in multigram quantities) in non&#8208;aqueous media. The protocol provides the target product as ca. 1.5&#8197;M CHCl3 solution which is stable at &#8722;18&#8201;&#176;C. The utility of the synthesized diazoalkane is illustrated by its [3+2] cycloaddition with electron&#8208;poor alkynes and alkenes providing the corresponding P(O)Me2&#8208;substituted pyrazoles and pyrazolines with moderate to good efficiency. In this view, the title compound represents and an important extension of medicinally relevant phosphine oxide reagents.

         <title>Electrochemical CO2 Reduction by Urea Hangman Mn Terpyridine species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduction of urea groups functioning as multipoint hydrogen&#8208;bonding hangman significantly increases the turnover frequency (TOF) for electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO to ca. 1008&#8197;s&#8722;1 with this family of molecular catalysts. The results clearly demonstrate a remarkable increase in icat/ip in comparison to the single&#8208;point hydrogen&#8208;bonding derivates.







Abstract
Based on our previous study in chemical subtleties of the proton tunneling distance for metal hydride formation (PTD&#8208;MH) to regulate the selectivity of CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), we have developed a family of Mn terpyridine derivatives, in which urea groups functions as multipoint hydrogen&#8208;bonding hangman to accelerate the reaction rate. We found that such changes to the second coordination sphere significantly increased the turnover frequency (TOF) for CO2 reduction to ca. 360 
 with this family of molecular catalysts while maintaining high selectivity (ca. 100&#8201;%&#177;3) for CO even in the presence of a large amount of phenol as proton source. Notably, the compounds studied in this manuscript all exhibit large value for 
 as that achieved by Fe porphyrins derivates, while saving up to 0.55&#8197;V in overpotential with respect to the latter.

         <title>Targeting of G&#8208;quadruplex DNA with 99mTc(I)/Re(I) Tricarbonyl Complexes Carrying Pyridostatin Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New (Radio)metalated G4 binders: Re(I) and 99mTc(I) complexes carrying pyridostatin derivatives for the targeting of G&#8208;quadruplex structures. The Re complex can bind to G4 DNA and RNA with selectivity over double&#8208;stranded DNA, exhibiting cytotoxic activity in MCF&#8208;7 human breast cancer and PC3 human prostate cancer cell lines. The 99mTc congener is stable in&#8197;vivo with a fast blood clearance in normal mice.







Abstract
The main goal of this work was to elucidate the potential relevance of (radio)metal chelates of 99mTc and Re targeting G&#8208;quadruplex structures for the design of new tools for cancer theranostics. 99mTc provides the complexes with the ability to perform single&#8208;photon&#8208;emission computed tomography imaging studies, while the Re complexes should act as anticancer agents upon interaction with specific G4 DNA or RNA structures present in tumor tissues. Towards this goal, we have developed isostructural 99mTc(I) and Re(I) tricarbonyl complexes anchored by a pyrazolyl&#8208;diamine (Pz) chelator carrying a pendant pyridostatin (PDS) fragment as the G4&#8208;binding motif. The interaction of the PDF&#8208;Pz&#8208;Re (8) complex with different G4&#8208;forming oligonucleotides was studied by circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy and FRET&#8208;melting assays. The results showed that the Re complex retained the ability to bind and stabilize G4&#8208;structures from different DNA or RNA sequences, namely those present on the SRC proto&#8208;oncogene and telomeric RNA (TERRA sequence). PDF&#8208;Pz&#8208;Re (8) showed low to moderate cytotoxicity in PC3 and MCF&#8208;7 cancer cell lines, as typically observed for G4&#8208;binders. Biodistribution studies of the congener PDF&#8208;Pz&#8208;99mTc (12) in normal mice showed that the complex undergoes a fast blood clearance with a predominant hepatobiliary excretion, pointing also for a high in&#8197;vitro stability.

Towards this goal, we have developed isostructural &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc(I) and Re(I) tricarbonyl complexes anchored by a pyrazolyl-diamine (Pz) chelator carrying a pendant pyridostatin (PDS) fragment as the G4-binding motif. The interaction of the PDF-Pz-Re (&lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;) complex with different G4-forming oligonucleotides was studied by circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy and FRET-melting assays. The results showed that the Re complex retained the ability to bind and stabilize G4-structures from different DNA or RNA sequences, namely those present on the SRC proto-oncogene and telomeric RNA (TERRA sequence). PDF-Pz-Re (&lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;) showed low to moderate cytotoxicity in PC3 and MCF-7 cancer cell lines, as typically observed for G4-binders. Biodistribution studies of the congener PDF-Pz-&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc (&lt;b&gt;12&lt;/b&gt;) in normal mice showed that the complex undergoes a fast blood clearance with a predominant hepatobiliary excretion, pointing also for a high &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Based Sensors for Benzene Vapor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development and challenges of benzene vapor sensors based on metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), which achieve effective detection by virtue of the singal changes in weight, chemiresistive, fluorescence or color after adsorption.







Abstract
Sensing of benzene vapor is a hot spot due to the volatile drastic carcinogen even at trace concentration. However, achieving convenient and rapid detection is still a challenge. As a sort of functional porous material, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been developed as detection sensors by adsorbing benzene vapor and converting it into other signals (fluorescence intensity/wavelength, chemiresistive, weight or color, etc.). Supramolecular interaction between benzene molecules and the host framework, aperture size/shape and structural flexibility are influential factors in the performance of MOF&#8208;based sensors. Therefore, enhancing the host&#8208;guest interactions between the host framework and benzene molecules, or regulating the diffusion rate of benzene molecules by changing the aperture size/shape and flexibility of the host framework to enhance the detection signal are effective strategies for constructing MOF&#8208;based sensors. This concept highlights several types of MOF&#8208;based sensors for the detection of benzene vapor.

         <title>Azulene&#8208;Containing Bis(squaraine) Dyes: Design, Synthesis and Aggregation Behaviors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The relationship among chemical structure, physicochemical property and aggregation behavior of organic functional material is an important research topic. Here, we designed and synthesized three bis(squaraine) dyes BSQ1, BSQ2 and BSQ3 through the combination of two kinds of unsymmetrical azulenyl squaraine monomers. Their physicochemical properties were investigated in both molecular and aggregate states. Generally, BSQ1 displayed different assembly behavior from BSQ2 and BSQ3. Upon fabrication into nanoparticles, BSQ1 tend to form J&#8208;aggregates while BSQ2 and BSQ3 tend to form H&#8208;aggregates in aqueous medium. When in the form of thin films, three bis(squaraine) dyes all adopted J&#8208;aggregation packing modes while only BSQ1 presented the most significant rearrangement of aggregate structures as well as the improvement in the carrier mobilities upon thermal annealing. Our research highlights the discrepancy of aggregation behaviors originating from the molecular structure and surrounding circumstances, providing guidance for the molecular design and functional applications of squaraines.</dc:description>

         <title>Cellular Uptake of Cell&#8208;Penetrating Peptides Activated by Amphiphilic p&#8208;Sulfonatocalix[4]arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of a series of amphiphilic p&#8208;sulfonatocalix[4]arenes with varying alkyl chain lengths (CX4&#8208;Cn) and their application as efficient counterion activators for membrane transport of cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs). The enhanced membrane activity is confirmed with the carboxyfluorescein (CF) assay in vesicles and by the direct cytosolic delivery of CPPs into CHO&#8208;K1, HCT 116, and KTC&#8208;1 cells enabling excellent cellular uptake of the CPPs into two cancer cell lines. Intracellular delivery was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy after CPP entry into live cells mediated by CX4&#8208;Cn, which was also quantified after cell lysis by fluorescence spectroscopy. The results present the first systematic exploration of structure&#8208;activity relationships for calixarene&#8208;based counterion activators and show that CX4&#8208;Cn are exceptionally effective in cellular delivery of CPPs. The dodecyl derivative, CX4&#8208;C12, serves as best activator. A first mechanistic insight is provided by efficient CPP uptake at 4 &#176;C and in the presence of the endocytosis inhibitor dynasore, which indicates a direct translocation of the CPP&#8208;counterion complexes into the cytosol and highlights the potential benefits of CX4&#8208;Cn for efficient and direct translocation of CPPs and CPP&#8208;conjugated cargo molecules into the cytosol of live cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimal oriented external electric elds to trigger a barrierless oxaphosphetane ring opening step of the Wittig reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Wittig reaction is one of the most important processes
in organic chemistry for the asymmetric synthesis of olefinic compounds.
In view of the increasingly acknowledged potentiality of the
electric fields in promoting reactions, here we will consider
the effect of the oriented external electric&#8194;field (OEEF) on
the second step of Wittig reaction (i.e. the ring opening
oxaphosphetane) in a model system for non&#8208;stabilized
ylides. In particular, we have determined the optimal direction
and strength of the electric &#8194;field that should be applied
to annihilate the reaction barrier of the ring opening
through the polarizable molecular electric dipole (PMED)
model that we have recently developed. We conclude that
the application of the optimal external electric &#8194;field for the
oxaphosphetane ring opening favours a Bestmann&#8208;like mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of the cirratiomycin biosynthesis gene cluster in Streptomyces cirratus: elucidation of the biosynthetic pathways for 2,3&#8208;diaminobutyric acid and hydroxymethylserine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cirratiomycin, a heptapeptide with antibacterial activity, was isolated and characterized in 1981; however, its biosynthetic pathway has not been elucidated. It contains several interesting nonproteinogenic amino acids, such as (2S,3S)&#8208;2,3&#8208;diaminobutyric acid ((2S,3S)&#8208;DABA) and &#945;&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)serine, as building blocks. Here, we report the identification of a cirratiomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces cirratus. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that several Streptomyces viridifaciens and Kitasatospora aureofaciens strains also have this cluster. One S. viridifaciens strain was confirmed to produce cirratiomycin. The biosynthetic gene cluster was shown to be responsible for cirratiomycin biosynthesis in S. cirratus in a gene inactivation experiment using CRISPR&#8208;cBEST. Interestingly, this cluster encodes a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) composed of 12 proteins, including those with an unusual domain organization: a stand&#8208;alone adenylation domain, two stand&#8208;alone condensation domains, two type II thioesterases, and two NRPS modules that have no adenylation domain. Using heterologous expression and in vitro analysis of recombinant enzymes, we revealed the biosynthetic pathway of (2S,3S)&#8208;DABA: (2S,3S)&#8208;DABA is synthesized from l&#8208;threonine by four enzymes, CirR, CirS, CirQ, and CirB. In addition, CirH, a glycine/serine hydroxymethyltransferase homolog, was shown to synthesize &#945;&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)serine from d&#8208;serine in vitro. These findings broaden our knowledge of nonproteinogenic amino acid biosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Responsive Gradient Structured Actuator via Photopolymerization&#8208;Induced Diffusion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive materials have recently gained significant attention in the field of soft robotics, sensors, and biomimetic devices. The most facile way for the fabrication of such materials remains to endow bilayer structures which are fabricated with the combination of active and passive layers. Although, easily fabricated, these structures suffer from the generation of stress points between connection areas. In this work we develop a method to create a thin film with controlled cross&#8208;link variation across its thickness. The cross&#8208;link gradient is achieved through polymerization induced diffusion of dithiol molecules in thiol&#8208;ene network. As a result, the film exhibits bending deformation upon illumination with light or exposure to a chemical solvent, thereby demonstrating dual responsiveness. Light actuation of the film achieved via photothermal effects due to the incorporation of dye into the system which can absorb UV light and heat the network. While solvent induced actuation is due to anisotropic swelling. Furthermore, the straightforward fabrication procedure allowed for the creation of more complex deformations by patterning the film using a photomask during photopolymerization.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stimuli-responsive materials have recently gained significant attention in the field of soft robotics, sensors, and biomimetic devices.

         <title>Inducing &#945;&#8208;helicity in peptides by silver coordination to cysteine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Short peptide sequences consisting of two cysteine residues separated by three other amino acids display complete change from random coil to &#945;&#8208;helical secondary structure in response to addition of Ag+ ions. The folded CXXXC/Ag+ complex involves formation of multinuclear Ag+ species and is stable in a wide pH range from below 3 to above 8. The complex is stable through reversed&#8208;phase HPLC separation as well as towards a physiological level of chloride ions, based on far&#8208;UV circular dichroism spectroscopy. In electrospray MS under acidic conditions a peptide dimer with four Ag+ ions bound was observed, and modelling based on potentiometric experiments supported this to be the dominating complex. The complex was demonstrated to work as a N&#8208;terminal nucleation site for inducing &#945;&#8208;helicity into longer peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Discharge Processes of Li&#8722;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8722;CO2 batteries correspond to renewable energy storage in a cost&#8208;effective, eco&#8208;friendly CO2 fixation manner. However, an inadequate understanding of their reaction mechanism severely impedes their development. Here we outline recent mechanistic advances in the discharge processes of Li&#8722;CO2 batteries, especially from the theoretical aspect. We first highlight the vital factors affecting the formation of discharge intermediates and a surface lithiation mechanism that may dominate the catalysts with weak CO2 adsorption. Then, we discuss the modeling of the chemical potential of Li+ + e&#8722;, which is crucial for the evaluation of the theoretical limiting voltage. Finally, we describe challenges and future directions to facilitate the understanding of Li&#8722;CO2 electrochemistry. This concept article would inspire more experimental and theoretical studies to advance the development of Li&#8722;CO2 electrochemical technology.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acenes and Naphthalene Diimides (NDIs) stand as distinguished classes of organic compounds, each possessing unique and intriguing properties that have garnered significant attention across various scientific disciplines. Acenes, characterized by linearly fused aromatic rings, have captivated researchers due to their diverse electronic structures and promising applications in materials science. On the other hand, NDIs, known for their distinctive electron&#8208;accepting properties, exhibit remarkable versatility in fields ranging from organic electronics, supramolecular to spin chemistry. In this review, we navigate through the fascinating realms of both acenes and NDIs before converging our focus on the highly diverse and distinctive subgroup of NDI&#8208;annulated heterocyclic acenes. This potentially important subgroup, has emerged as a subject of intense investigation, encapsulating their fascinating synthesis, optical and electrochemical characteristics, and multifaceted applications that span the realms of chemistry, physics, and biology. Through the exploration of their synthetic strategies, unique properties, and diverse applications, this review aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of the pivotal role played by NDI&#8208;based heterocyclic acenes in contemporary multidisciplinary research and technological innovation.</dc:description>

         <title>Mesogenic Ordering&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly of Liquid Crystalline Block Copolymers in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the development of nanotechnology, the preparation of polymeric nanoparticles with nicely defined structures has been well&#8208;developed, and the functionalization and subsequent applications of the resultant nanostructures are becoming increasingly important. Particularly, by introducing mesogenic ordering as the driving force for the solution&#8208;state self&#8208;assembly of liquid crystalline (LC) block copolymers (BCPs), micellar nanostructures with different morphologies, especially anisotropic morphologies, can be easily prepared. This review summarizes the recent progress in the solution&#8208;state self&#8208;assembly of LC BCPs and is mostly focused on four main related aspects, including an in&#8208;depth understanding of the mesogenic ordering&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, precise self&#8208;assembly methods, utilization of these methods to fabricate hierarchical structures, and the potential applications of these well&#8208;defined nanostructures. We hope not only to make a systematic summary of previous studies but also to provide some useful thinking for the future development of this field.</dc:description>

         <title>A Healable Quasi&#8208;Solid Polymer Electrolyte with Balanced Toughness and Ionic Conductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have garnered extensive attention as potential alternatives to traditional liquid electrolytes, primarily due to their prowess in curbing lithium dendrite formation and preventing electrolyte leaks. The quest for SPEs that are both mechanically robust and exhibit superior ionic conductivity has been vigorous. However, achieving a harmonious balance between these two attributes remains a significant challenge. In this study, we introduce a novel quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte, ingeniously crafted from a poly(urethane&#8208;urea) network, enriched with lithium salts and plasticizers. This innovative composition not only boasts remarkable toughness but also ensures commendable ionic conductivity. Our post&#8208;gelation method yields gel polymer electrolytes that undergo rigorous evaluation, leading to an optimized version that stands out with its exceptional room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity (2.94 &#215; 10&#8208;4 S cm&#8208;1) and outstanding toughness (11.9 MJ m&#8208;3). Moreover, it demonstrates a broad electrochemical window (4.73 V), remarkable stability across a 600&#8208;hour cycle test, a high capacity retention exceeding 80% after 100 cycles at 0.2 C, and a noteworthy self&#8208;healing capability. This quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte emerges as a promising contender to replace current liquid electrolyte solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>Quest for Double M&#246;bius Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Neutral four&#8208;membered rings with 4n electrons are generally H&#252;ckel antiaromatic. On the other hand, 4n electron system can also be M&#246;bius aromatic, although identification has escaped so far. A recent study of double M&#246;bius aromaticity has been put forwarded in the D2h symmetric singlet ground state of four member Pa2B2 ring. Although interesting, but the synthesis possesses a significant challenge as Pa is rare, highly radioactive and toxic. Herein, a synthetically viable four membered Rh2B2 cluster is proposed which contains double M&#246;bius aromaticity. Interestingly, the three membered RhB2&#8208; cluster also possess M&#246;bius aromaticity and is the smallest ring to show such phenomenon.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Glycosylated Soluble Fas Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical access to the enigmatic death receptor ligand sFasL in its glycosylated version using a combination of native chemical and diselenide selenoester ligation.







Abstract
Controlled cell death is essential for the regulation of the immune system and plays a role in pathogen defense. It is often altered in pathogenic conditions such as cancer, viral infections and autoimmune diseases. The Fas receptor and its corresponding membrane&#8208;bound ligand (FasL) are part of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway activated in these cases. A soluble form of FasL (sFasL), produced by ectodomain shedding, displays a diverse but still elusive set of non&#8208;apoptotic functions and sometimes even serves as a pro&#8208;survival factor. To gather more knowledge about the characteristics of this protein and the impact N&#8208;glycosylations may have, access to homogeneous posttranslationally modified variants of sFasL is needed. Therefore, we developed a flexible strategy to obtain such homogeneously N&#8208;glycosylated variants of sFasL by applying chemical protein synthesis. This strategy can be flexibly combined with enzymatic methods to introduce more complex, site selective glycosylations.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlled cell death is essential for the regulation of the immune system and plays a role in pathogen defense. It is often altered in pathogenic conditions such as cancer, viral infections and autoimmune diseases. The Fas receptor and its corresponding membrane-bound ligand (FasL) are part of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway activated in these cases. A soluble form of FasL (sFasL), produced by ectodomain shedding, displays a diverse but still elusive set of non-apoptotic functions and sometimes even serves as a pro-survival factor. To gather more knowledge about the characteristics of this protein and the impact N-glycosylations may have, access to homogeneous posttranslationally modified variants of sFasL is needed. Therefore, we developed a flexible strategy to obtain such homogeneously N-glycosylated variants of sFasL by applying chemical protein synthesis. This strategy can be flexibly combined with enzymatic methods to introduce more complex, site selective glycosylations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cationic Hypervalent Chalcogen Bond Catalysis on the Povarov Reaction: Reactivity and Stereoselectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism and reactivity of the Povarov reaction catalyzed by cationic hypervalent chalcogen bond catalysts were discussed by DFT calculations, and importance of electrostatic energy on the reactivity was explored. The structure&#8208;property relationship between positive electrostatic potential and Gibbs free energy barrier was established to assess the reactivity. Furthermore, the importance of the C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction in stereoselectivity was clarified for solving stereoselectivity in other reactions.







Abstract
Chalcogen bond catalysis, particularly cationic hypervalent chalcogen bond catalysis, is considered to be an effective strategy for organocatalysis. In this work, the cationic hypervalent chalcogen bond catalysis for the Povarov reaction between N&#8208;benzylideneaniline and ethyl vinyl ether was investigated by density functional theory (DFT). The catalytic reaction involves the cycloaddition process and the proton transfer process, and the rate&#8208;determining step is the cycloaddition process. Cationic hypervalent tellurium derivatives bearing CF3 and F groups exhibit superior catalytic activity. For the rate&#8208;determining step, the Gibbs free energy barrier decreases as the positive electrostatic potential of the chalcogen bond catalysts increases. More importantly, the Gibbs free energy barrier has a strong linear correlation with the electrostatic energy of the chalcogen bond in the catalyst&#8208;substrate complex. Furthermore, the catalytic reactions include the endo pathway and exo pathway. The C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction between the substituent of the ethyl vinyl ether and the aryl ring of the N&#8208;benzylideneaniline contributes to the endo&#8208;selectivity of the reaction. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of chalcogen bond catalysis, providing insights for designing chalcogen bond catalysts with high performance.

Neutral pincer bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;2,6&#8208;di(amino)pyridine (&#8220;PN3P&#8221;) ligands appear to play a central role in the electrocatalytic abilities of the Zn(II) complexes [Zn(&#954;2&#8208;2,6&#8208;{Ph2PNR}2(NC5H3)Br2] (R=Me, 1; R=H, 2). The complexes electrocatalytically reduce CO2 at &#8208;2.3&#8197;V vs. Fc+/0 to selectively yield CO in mixed water/acetonitrile solutions and generate H2 from water in acetonitrile solutions with Faradaic efficiencies up to 90&#8201;%.







Abstract
Air and water&#8208;stable zinc (II) complexes of neutral pincer bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;2,6&#8208;di(amino)pyridine (&#8220;PN3P&#8221;) ligands are reported. These compounds, [Zn(&#954;2&#8208;2,6&#8208;{Ph2PNR}2(NC5H3))Br2] (R=Me, 1; R=H, 2), were shown to be capable of electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 at &#8722;2.3&#8197;V vs. Fc+/0 to selectively yield CO in mixed water/acetonitrile solutions. These complexes also electrocatalytically generate H2 from water in acetonitrile solutions, at the same potential, with Faradaic efficiencies of up to 90&#8201;%. DFT computations support a proposed mechanism involving the first reduction of 1 or 2 occurring at the PN3P ligand. Furthermore, computational analysis suggested a mechanism involving metal&#8208;ligand cooperation of a Lewis acidic Zn(II) and a basic ligand.

         <title>Phosphorescent Platinum(II) Complexes with a Spiro&#8208;fused Xanthene Unit: Synthesis and Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of phosphorescent platinum(II) complexes chelated by an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) linked to a cyclometalating spiro[fluorene&#8208;9,9&#8217;&#8208;xanthene] (SFX) motif in 2&#8208;position, is hereby reported. Acetylacetonate (acac), bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)propane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dionate (mesacac) and dihydrobis(3,5&#8208;dimethylpyrazole&#8208;1&#8208;yl) borate are used as auxiliary ligands. These complexes show ligand&#8208;centered (LC) green&#8208;blue emission with photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) ranging from 87&#8201;%&#8211;91&#8201;%. The emission lifetimes vary from 33&#8197;&#956;s to 43&#8197;&#956;s. DFT calculations show that the corresponding 2&#8217;&#8208;regioisomer of the SFX motif with the mesacac ligand has a strong metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) character instead of a LC character.







Abstract
Novel platinum(II) complexes, derived from the spiro[fluorene&#8208;9,9&#8217;&#8208;xanthene] (SFX) motif, were synthesized and combined with different auxiliary ligands such as acetylacetonate (acac), bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)propane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dionate (mesacac) and dihydrobis(3,5&#8208;dimethylpyrazole&#8208;1&#8208;yl) borate. The final products were obtained in yields of up to 36&#8201;% and characterized by NMR, X&#8208;ray and combustion analysis. These complexes have structured green&#8208;blue emission spectra with Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIExy) coordinates of (0.21;0.46). Excellent photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) ranging from 87&#8201;%&#8211;91&#8201;% were found. The emission lifetimes vary from 33&#8197;&#956;s to 43&#8197;&#956;s. Calculations on the B3LYP/6&#8208;311++G** level of theory reveal, that the nature of the emissive state is dependent on the positional regioisomerism of the SFX motif. The 2&#8208;SFX complexes demonstrate ligand&#8208;centered (3LC) emission, while the 2&#8217;&#8208;SFX regioisomer with the mesacac ligand shows a strong 3MLCT character.

A palladium&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] decarboxylative cycloaddition of 4&#8208;vinybenzodioxinones with barbiturate&#8208;derived alkenes has been developed, providing the corresponding spirobarbiturate&#8722;chromane derivatives in generally high yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities.







Abstract
In this paper, Pd&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] decarboxylative cycloaddition of 4&#8208;vinylbenzodioxinones with barbiturate&#8208;derived alkenes has been developed, leading to various spirobarbiturate&#8722;chromane derivatives in high yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The scale&#8208;up reaction and further derivation of the product were demonstrated. A plausible reaction mechanism was also proposed.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Formed Electron Inhibitor Enabling Dendrite&#8208;free Garnet Electrolytes: A Case Study of Fumed Silica</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modified solid&#8208;state electrolytes were prepared by introducing fumed silica (FS) into Ta&#8208;doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZTO). The introduced FS could decrease the ion migration activation energy, decrease the electronic conductivity, acting as electron inhibitor in the garnet pellet, thus improving the overall battery performance. Our research contributes to the advancement of dendrite&#8208;free solid&#8208;state electrolytes and high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.







Abstract
Ta&#8208;doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZTO) solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SEs) show great promise for solid&#8208;state batteries due to its high conductivity and safety. However, one of the challenges it faces is lithium dendrite propagation upon long&#8208;term cycling. To address this issue, we propose the incorporation of fumed silica (FS) at the grain boundaries of LLZTO to modify the properties of the garnet pellet, which effectively inhibits the dendrite growth. The introduction of FS has demonstrated several beneficial effects. Firstly, it reduces the migration barrier of lithium ions, which helps prevent dendrite formation and propagation. Additionally, FS reduces the electronic conductivity of the SEs pellet, suppressing the dendrite formation. Moreover, the formed lithium silicates from FS might also be acted as electron inhibitor, thus inhibiting the lithium dendrite growth upon cycling. By investigating the use of FS as a modifier in LLZTO&#8208;based electrolytes, our study contributes to advancing dendrite&#8208;free solid&#8208;state electrolytes and thus the development of high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Temperature Control of the Self&#8208;Assembly Process of 4&#8208;Aminoquinoline Amphiphile: Selective Construction of Perforated Vesicles and Nanofibers, and Structural Restoration Capability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the selective construction of perforated vesicles and nanofibers based on temperature control of self&#8208;assembly process of a 4&#8208;aminoquinoline&#8208;based amphiphile through its LCST behavior in 10&#8197;mM HEPES buffer (pH&#8197;7.4). The perforated vesicles exhibit a slow morphological transformation but can be readily restored with a brief heating above the LCST.







Abstract
The construction of diverse and distinctive self&#8208;assembled structures in water, based on the control of the self&#8208;assembly processes of artificial small molecules, has received considerable attention in supramolecular chemistry. Cage&#8208;like perforated vesicles are distinctive and interesting self&#8208;assembled structures. However, the development of self&#8208;assembling molecules that can easily form perforated vesicles remains challenging. This paper reports a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior&#8208;triggered self&#8208;assembly property of a 4&#8208;aminoquinoline (4&#8208;AQ)&#8208;based amphiphile with a tetra(ethylene glycol) chain, in HEPES buffer (pH&#8197;7.4). This property allows to form perforated vesicles after heating at 80&#8201;&#176;C (&gt; LCST). The self&#8208;assembly process of the 4&#8208;AQ amphiphile can be controlled by heating at 80&#8201;&#176;C (&gt; LCST) or 60&#8201;&#176;C (&lt; LCST). After cooling to room temperature, the selective construction of the perforated vesicles and nanofibers was achieved from the same 4&#8208;AQ amphiphile. Furthermore, the perforated vesicles exhibited slow morphological transformation into intertwined&#8208;like nanofibers but were easily restored by brief heating above the LCST.

         <dc:description>Sensitivity enhanced dynamic nuclear polarization solid&#8208;state NMR is emerging as a powerful technique for probing the structural properties of conformationally homogenous and heterogenous biomolecular species irrespective of size at atomic resolution within native environments. Herein we detail advancements that have made acquiring such data, specifically within the confines of intact bacterial and eukaryotic cell a reality, and further discuss the type of structural information that can be presently garnered by the technique&#8217;s exploitation. Subsequently, we discuss bottlenecks that have thus far curbed cellular DNP&#8208;ssNMR&#8217;s broad adoption, namely a lack of sensitivity and spectral resolution, and explore possible solutions ranging from utilization of new pulse sequences, design of better performing polarizing agents, and application of additional biochemical/ cell biological methodologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Fe Doping Profile on Current Collapse in GaN&#8208;based RF HEMTs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using computer&#8208;aided design (TCAD) simulation, the impact of the Fe doping profile, including concentration, decay rate, and depth of the doping region on current&#8208;collapse magnitude (&#8710;CC) in 0.5&#8208;&#956;m gated GaN&#8208;based high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) is systematically investigated. Accurate simulation models are established and developed to facilitate the fabrication of electronics. It is elucidated that the intricate interplay between trapping and de&#8208;trapping of Fe&#8208;related traps at the gate&#8208;drain edge is responsible for current collapse. The concentration and decay rate of the doping region have a more significant impact on current collapse than the depth. Increased trap state density near two&#8208;dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel caused by deep&#8208;level acceptors would boost &#8710;CC. However, a minor dynamic reduction in 2DEG density (nT) induces a relatively small &#8710;CC. By adjusting the concentration, decay rate, and depth of the doping region, &#8710;CC of GaN&#8208;based Radio Frequency (RF) HEMTs can be reduced by approximately 50.3%.The optimized distribution of Fe doping discussed in this work helps to prepare GaN&#8208;based RF HEMTs with a limited current collapse effect.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>7Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is an ideal tool to study hierarchically assembled helicates of the form Li[Li3L6Ti2]. Internally bound and external lithium ions can be well distinguished by solution&#8208; or solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and dimerization constants of the monomer/dimer equilibrium can be easily determined in solution. Averaged dimerization constants can be estimated in case of statistical mixtures of helicates formed from mixtures of ligands.</dc:description>

Internally bound and external lithium ions can be well distinguished by solution- or solid-state NMR spectroscopy and dimerization constants of the monomer/dimer equilibrium can be easily determined in solution. Averaged dimerization constants can be estimated in case of statistical mixtures of helicates formed from mixtures of ligands.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dextrans, Pullulan and Lentinan, New Scaffold Materials for Use as Hydrogels in Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogel saccharide world: The synthesis of hydrogels based on dextrans, pullulan, and lentinan under physiological conditions are reported by evaluating two different &#8220;click&#8221;&#8208;strategies. In selected cases either ligands (L) with growth factor properties or alternatively fluorescent dyes are attached to the hydrogels for biomedical applications. In addition, rheological properties, water uptake, permeability, degradability and cytotoxicity have been assessed.







Abstract
The development of hydrogels based on dextrans, pullulan and lentinan to be used in biomedical applications including tissue engineering is reported. Despite the fact that selected polysaccharides such as hyaluronic acid are well established, little is known, how these polysaccharides can be chemically modified to create hydrogels under controlled conditions. In this study we present a small library of chemically modified polysaccharides which are used for a divergent approach to achieve biomedical relevant hydrogels. In this case the crosslinking is based on thio ether formation between thiol modified donor and vinylsulfone or maleimide modified acceptor components. Successful synthesis of the linker systems and coupling at the polysaccharides, hydrogel formation takes place under physiological conditions. We extended the study by coupling small molecules like adhesion factors for increasing cell compatibility as well as a dye for further studies. The different hydrogels were studied to their rheological properties, water uptake, their permeability, biodegrability and their cytotoxicity.

         <title>Expanding Chemical Frontiers: Approaches for Generating Diverse and Bioactive Natural Product&#8208;Like Compounds Libraries from Extracts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining natural and synthetic chemical spaces is achievable through the generation of &#8216;natural product&#8208;like compounds&#8217; that incorporate structural elements from natural and synthetic precursors, by directly chemically modifying natural extracts. The review provides insights into this approach, covering alterations from simple substitutions to complete scaffold remodelling, and highlighting achievements, promises and technical challenges in the field.







Abstract
The realms of natural products and synthetic compounds exhibit distinct chemical spaces that not only differ but also complement each other. While the convergence of these two domains has been explored through semisynthesis and conventional pharmacomodulation endeavours applied to natural frameworks, a recent and innovative approach has emerged that involves the combinatorial generation of libraries of &#8216;natural product&#8208;like compounds&#8217; (NPLCs) through the direct synthetic derivatization of natural extracts. This has led to the production of numerous NPLCs that incorporate structural elements from both their natural (multiple saturated rings, oxygen content, chiral centres) and synthetic (aromatic rings, nitrogen and halogen content, drug&#8208;like properties) precursors. Through careful selection of extracts and reagents, specific bioactivities have been achieved, and this strategy has been deployed in various ways, showing great promise without reaching its full potential to date. This review seeks to provide an overview of reported examples involving the chemical engineering of extracts, showcasing a spectrum of natural product alterations spanning from simple substitutions to complete scaffold remodelling. It also includes an analysis of the accomplishments, perspectives and technical challenges within this field.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated BPC catalyzed late&#8208;stage solution phase desulfonylation from tryptophan, tyrosine and histidine amino acid residues in oligopeptides is presented herein, by overcoming the isolation issue up to octamers. Additionally, organophotocatalyst BPC demonstrates efficient solution&#8208;phase phenacyl deprotection from C&#8208;terminal in peptides. This effective and mild strategy portrayes exceptional selectivity by tolerating a wide range of functional groups in heteroaromatics and peptides.







Abstract
Herein, BPC catalyzed visible&#8208;light&#8208;triggered target&#8208;specific late&#8208;stage solution phase desulfonylation from tryptophan in oligopeptides is portrayed by overcoming the isolation issue up to octamers. This robust and mild method is highly predictable and chemoselective, tolerating myriad of functional groups in aza&#8208;heteroaromatics and peptides. Interestingly, reductive desulfonylation is also amenable to biologically significant reactive histidine and tyrosine side chains, signifying the versatility of the strategy. Additional efficacy of BPC is demonstrated by solution phase phenacyl deprotection from C&#8208;terminal in peptides. Furthermore, excellent catalyst loading of 0.5&#8197;mol% and recyclability demonstrate the practical utility and applicability of this strategy.

         <title>Influence of Defects and Charges on the Colloidal Stabilization of Graphene in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphite intercalation compounds allow gentle exfoliation of soluble graphenide (reduced graphene) flakes. Oxidation of graphenide to graphene and solvent exchange produce aqueous graphene dispersions (Eau de graphene, EdG), stabilized by electrostatic forces, with a minimal amount of defects if graphenide oxidation is carried out before exposure to water.







Abstract
Mastering graphene preparation is an essential step to its integration into practical applications. For large&#8208;scale purposes, full graphite exfoliation appears as a suitable route for graphene production. However, it requires overpowering attractive van der Waals forces demanding large energy input, with the risk of introducing defects in the material. This difficulty can be overcome by using graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) as starting material. The greater inter&#8208;sheet separation in GICs (compared with graphite) allows the gentler exfoliation of soluble graphenide (reduced graphene) flakes. A solvent exchange strategy, accompanied by the oxidation of graphenide to graphene, can be implemented to produce stable aqueous graphene dispersions (Eau de graphene, EdG), which can be readily incorporated into many processes or materials. In this work, we prove that electrostatic forces are responsible for the stability of fully exfoliated graphene in water, and explore the influence of the oxidation and solvent exchange procedures on the quality and stability of EdG. We show that the amount of defects in graphene is limited if graphenide oxidation is carried out before exposing the material to water, and that gas removal of water before the incorporation of pre&#8208;oxidized graphene is advantageous for the long&#8208;term stability of EdG.

         <title>Chiral Bis&#8208;phosphate Macrocycles for Catalytic, Efficient, and Enantioselective Electrophilic Fluorination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis&#8208;phosphate macrocycles have been designed with an integrated chiral cavity and two cooperative phosphate sites for accommodating DABCO dications through complementary ion&#8208;pair interactions. Only 2&#8197;mol% of the macrocycle was necessary for efficiently catalyzing the fluorocyclization of tryptamines in up to 91&#8201;% ee, thus significantly outperforming the acyclic counterparts (lower reactivity; &lt;20&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Incorporation of privileged catalytic scaffolds into a macrocyclic skeleton represents an attractive strategy to furnish supramolecular catalysis systems with enzyme&#8208;mimetic cavity and multi&#8208;site cooperation. Herein we reported the synthesis, structure, binding properties and catalytic application of a series of chiral bis&#8208;phosphate macrocycles toward the challenging asymmetric electrophilic fluorination. With a large, integrated chiral cavity and two cooperative phosphate sites, these macrocycles exhibited good inclusion toward 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) dicationic ammoniums through complementary ion&#8208;pair and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions, as confirmed by crystallographic and solution binding studies. In fluorocyclization of tryptamines with Selectfluor reagent which has a similar DABCO&#8208;based dicationic structure, only 2&#8197;mol% macrocycle catalyst afforded the desired pyrroloindoline products in moderate yields and up to 91&#8201;% ee. For comparison, the acyclic mono&#8208;phosphate analogue gave obviously lower reactivity and enantioselectivity (&lt;20&#8201;% ee), suggesting a remarkable macrocyclic effect. The high catalytic efficiency and superior stereocontrol were ascribed to the tight ion&#8208;pair binding and cavity&#8208;directed noncovalent interaction cooperation.

         <title>Metal Organic Frameworks Synthesis: The Versatility of Triethylamine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exploration of suitable synthesis strategies to meet specific needs has been a very active research topic in the field of MOFs. Triethylamine as an organic base has consistently played a fundamental role in the development of MOF syntheses. This concept summarizes the versatility of triethylamine and provides insights into further development of MOF syntheses.







Abstract
Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials with exceptionally customizable composition and properties. MOFs intrinsically possess open metal sites, tunable pore size/shape and an ultra&#8208;large specific surface area, and have obtained significant attention over the past 30&#8197;years. Furthermore, through the integration of functional moieties such as, molecules, functional groups, noble metal clusters and nanocrystals or nanoparticles into MOFs, the resulting composites have greatly enriched the physical and chemical properties of pure MOFs, enabling their application in a wider range of fields. Triethylamine (TEA) as an organic base has consistently played a fundamental role in the development of MOFs. In this Concept, the versatility of triethylamine when involved in the synthesis of MOFs is discussed. Four sections are used to elaborate on the role of TEA including: (1) Single crystal synthesis; (2) Size and morphology control; (3) Counterion of MOFs; (4) MOFs composites synthesis. In the last part, we highlight the potential of TEA for further developments.

         <title>Computational Study Into the Oxidative Ring&#8208;Closure Mechanism During the Biosynthesis of Deoxypodophyllotoxin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insert text for Table of Contents here. Density functional theory calculations on large enzymatic cluster models of deoxypodophyllotoxin synthase shows that substrate (&#8722;)&#8208;yatein reacts efficiently through a radical reaction mechanism to form the oxidative ring&#8208;closure, while the OH rebound is prevented through electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions to the oxidant that guide the selectivity of the reaction.







Abstract
The nonheme iron dioxygenase deoxypodophyllotoxin synthase performs an oxidative ring&#8208;closure reaction as part of natural product synthesis in plants. How the enzyme enables the oxidative ring&#8208;closure reaction of (&#8722;)&#8208;yatein and avoids substrate hydroxylation remains unknown. To gain insight into the reaction mechanism and understand the details of the pathways leading to products and by&#8208;products we performed a comprehensive computational study. The work shows that substrate is bound tightly into the substrate binding pocket with the C7&#8217;&#8722;H bond closest to the iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species. The reaction proceeds through a radical mechanism starting with hydrogen atom abstraction from the C7&#8217;&#8722;H position followed by ring&#8208;closure and a final hydrogen transfer to form iron(II)&#8208;water and deoxypodophyllotoxin. Alternative mechanisms including substrate hydroxylation and an electron transfer pathway were explored but found to be higher in energy. The mechanism is guided by electrostatic perturbations of charged residues in the second&#8208;coordination sphere that prevent alternative pathways.

         <title>Highly Sensitive Switchable Sensors for Hydroxide on Glass Surfaces Based on Isoquinolinium&#8208;Quinolinium&#8208;substituted Acetylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The title compounds are sensitive sensors for less than 0.5&#8197;ppm hydroxide, the release of which can even be detected from high&#8208;quality wine glasses by intensive coloration. Adduct formation with O&#8208;nucleophiles is responsible for this. Acid reconstitutes the initial state.







Abstract
Bi&#8208;substituted acetylenes with a quinolinium and an isoquinolinium substituent are described, which reversibly form intensely colored adducts with O&#8208;nucleophiles and thus enable the detection of &gt;0,5&#8197;ppm hydroxide on the surfaces of various glasses. Acids reconstitute the colorless bi&#8208;substituted acetylenes. The quinolinium and isoquinolinium rings are bound via their 2&#8208;, 3&#8208;, 4&#8208; and 1&#8208;, 3&#8208;, 4&#8208;positions to the triple bond, respectively. The choice of substitution sites of the hetarenium rings enables the design of mixed conjugated/cross&#8208;conjugated &#960;&#8208;electron systems. Depending on the combination of binding sites, the frontier orbital profile, the triple bond polarization, the fluorescence behaviour, and the sensitivity to hydroxide differs.

         <title>Bi(III) Binding Stoichiometry and Domain&#8208;Specificity Differences Between Apo and Zn(II)&#8208;bound Human Metallothionein 1a</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallothionein (MT) binds a variety of metals using 20 cysteine residues. When Bi(III) binds to apo&#8208;MT, a maximum of six Bi(III) bind. The binding of Bi(III) &#8220;tangles&#8221; the protein, resulting in free but inaccessible cysteines, preventing further binding. When Bi(III) binds to Zn7MT, the formation of Bi7MT is favourable, showing that the initial MT structure impacts the metallated species formed.







Abstract
Bismuth is a xenobiotic metal with a high affinity to sulfur that is used in a variety of therapeutic applications. Bi(III) induces the cysteine&#8208;rich metallothionein (MT), a protein known to form two&#8208;domain cluster structures with certain metals such as Zn(II), Cd(II), or Cu(I). The binding of Bi(III) to MTs has been previously studied, but there are conflicting reports on the stoichiometry and binding pathway, which appear to be highly dependent on pH and initial metal&#8208;loading status of the MT. Additionally, domain specificity has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, ESI&#8208;MS was used to determine the binding constants of [Bi(EDTA)]&#8722; binding to apo&#8208;MT1a and its individual &#945;MT fragment. The results were compared to previous experiments using &#946;MT1a and &#946;&#945;MT3. Domain specificity was investigated using proteolysis methods and the initial cooperatively formed Bi2MT was found to bind to cysteines that spanned across the traditional metal binding domain regions. Titrations of [Bi(EDTA)]&#8722; into Zn7MT were performed and were found to result in a maximum stoichiometry of Bi7MT, contrasting the Bi6MT formed when [Bi(EDTA)]&#8722; was added to apo&#8208;MT. These results show that the initial structure of the apo&#8208;MT determines the stoichiometry of new incoming metals and explains the previously observed differences in stoichiometry.

         <title>NiCo&#8208;LDH coupled with 2D ZIF&#8208;derived Co nitrogen doped carbon nanosheet arrays as a self&#8208;supporting electrocatalyst for detection of formaldehyde</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique coupling NiCo&#8208;LDH with 2D ZIF derived Co&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon on carbon cloth (Co&#8722;N/C@NiCo&#8208;LDH NSAs/CC) acts as a self&#8208;supporting electrode has excellent sensing performance for formaldehyde with low detection limit of 82&#8197;nM at S/N=3 and a wide linear range of 1&#8197;&#956;M to 13&#8197;mM, respectively.







Abstract
Formaldehyde is susceptible to illegal addition to foodstuffs to extend their shelf life due to its antimicrobial, preservative and bleaching properties. In this study, a self&#8208;supporting &#8220;nanosheet on nanosheet&#8221; arrays electrocatalyst with core&#8208;shell heterostructure was prepared in&#8197;situ by coupling NiCo layer double hydroxide with 2D ZIF derived Co&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon on carbon cloth (Co&#8722;N/C@NiCo&#8208;LDH NSAs/CC). Co&#8722;N/C nanosheet arrays act as a scaffold core with good electrical conductivity, providing more NiCo&#8208;LDH nucleation sites to avoid NiCo&#8208;LDH agglomeration, thus having fast mass/charge transfer performance. While the NiCo&#8208;LDH nanosheet arrays shell with high specific surface area provide more active sites for electrochemical reactions. As an electrocatalytic sensing electrode, Co&#8722;N/C@NiCo&#8208;LDH NSAs/CC has a wide linear range of 1&#8197;&#956;M to 13&#8197;mM for formaldehyde detection, and the detection limit is 82&#8197;nM. Besides, the sensor has been applied to the detection of formaldehyde in food samples with satisfactory results.

In this study, a self-supporting &#8220;nanosheet on nanosheet&#8221; arrays electrocatalyst with core-shell heterostructure was prepared in&#8197;situ by coupling NiCo layer double hydroxide with 2D ZIF derived Co-nitrogen-doped porous carbon on carbon cloth (Co&#8722;N/C@NiCo-LDH NSAs/CC). Co&#8722;N/C nanosheet arrays act as a scaffold core with good electrical conductivity, providing more NiCo-LDH nucleation sites to avoid NiCo-LDH agglomeration, thus having fast mass/charge transfer performance. While the NiCo-LDH nanosheet arrays shell with high specific surface area provide more active sites for electrochemical reactions. As an electrocatalytic sensing electrode, Co&#8722;N/C@NiCo-LDH NSAs/CC has a wide linear range of 1&#8197;&#956;M to 13&#8197;mM for formaldehyde detection, and the detection limit is 82&#8197;nM. Besides, the sensor has been applied to the detection of formaldehyde in food samples with satisfactory results.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Isolation of a Homochiral Nanohoop Composed of a Tr&#246;ger's Base and Hexaparaphenylene</title>

         <dc:description>
A witch with a racemic pair of our nanohoops, TB[6]CPPs, chants words shown in the font of a magical world. This magic is that the chirality of Troger&#8242;s base forces paraphenylenes to become part of a circularly polarized luminescence chromophore. The spiral light bands coming out to the space indicate CPL and give the impression that our research contributes to the development of CPL chromophores, for example, of a 3D display in the near future. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Yoshigoe and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202304059).

         <title>Synthesis and Structure of the Small Superelectrophile [C2(OH)2Me2]2+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of the small superelectrophile [C2(OH)2Me2]2+ turned out to be a challenging task since stabilizing it in convenient superacids was not possible. Quantum chemical calculations predict a reduced C2 symmetry, yet experimental data confirms C2h symmetry in the solid state. The origin of this finding is fathomed based on X&#8208;ray structure analysis together with quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
The acid&#8208;activation of 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds plays a key role in a variety of electrophilic reactions, some of which are only accessible in superacidic media when a superelectrophilic dication is formed. To obtain structural and electronic information about these elusive species, the vicinal dication [C2(OH)2Me2]2+ is synthesized and characterized by Raman spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction. Since this superelectrophile could not be stabilized in convenient superacids, the usage of liquid SO2 turned out to be crucial. The experimental data are discussed together with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations on the B3LYP/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ level of theory. Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analyses quantify the superelectrophilic interactions found in the solid state.

         <title>Socialane, a Nonaprenyl Terpene Hydrocarbon Surface Lipid from the Collembola Hypogastrura socialis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Springtails use unique compounds for their outermost epicuticular wax layer, often of terpenoid origin. We report here the structure and synthesis of socialane, the major cuticular constituent of the Collembola Hypogastrura socialis. Socialane is also the first regular nonaprenyl terpene with a cyclic head group. The saturated side chain has seven stereogenic centers, making the determination of the configuration difficult. We describe here the identification of socialane and a synthetic approach using the building blocks farnesol and phytol, enantioselective hydrogenation, and a&#8208;alkylation of sulfones for the synthesis of various stereoisomers. NMR experiments showed the presence of an anti&#8208;configuration of the methyl groups closest to the benzene ring and that the other methyl groups of the polyprenyl side&#8208;chain are not uniformly configured. Furthermore, socialane is structurally different from [6+2]&#8208;terpene viaticene of the closely related H. viatica, showing species specificity of the epicuticular lipids of this genus and hinting at a possible role of surface lipids in the communication of these gregarious arthropods.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimodal use of chiral &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylalanine in Aib Foldamers: study of the position impact towards the helical screw&#8208;sense preference</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligomers of the achiral &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) adopt a 310 helical conformation in which the screw&#8208;sense preference can be controlled by a single chiral residue. The use of the fluorinated residue &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylalanine (&#945;&#8208;TfmAla) revealed a unique way to both induce and measure the screw&#8208;sense preference of such oligomers acting as 19F NMR probe. This work proposes a systematic study of the effect of this fluorinated chiral inducer on the helical screw&#8208;sense preference of poly&#8208;Aib oligomers. The impact of the position of the fluorinated residue into pentamers (N&#8208;terminal, central or C&#8208;terminal) as well as the nature of the C&#8208;terminal capping of the peptides was thoroughly studied in light of complete structural analysis. A deeper understanding of the fluorine effect was achieved confirming the unique ability of &#945;&#8208;TfmAla as a helical screw&#8208;sense controller.</dc:description>

         <title>A GFP inspired 8&#8208;methoxyquinoline&#8208;derived fluorescent molecular sensor for the detection of Zn2+ by two&#8208;photon microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An effective, GFP&#8208;inspired fluorescent Zn2+ sensor is developed for two&#8208;photon microscopy and related biological application that featured an 8&#8208;methoxyquinoline moiety. Excellent photophysical characteristics including a 37&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement with excitation and emission maxima at 440 nm and 505&#160;nm, respectively, as well as a high two&#8208;photon cross&#8208;section of 73 GM at 880 nm are reported. Based on the experimental data, the relationship between the structure and properties was elucidated and explained backed up by DFT calculations, particularly to the observed PeT phenomenon for the turn&#8208;on process. Biological validation and detailed experimental and theoretical characterization of the free and the zinc&#8208;bound compounds are presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of polymer side chain size and backbone length on the self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular polymer bottlebrushes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen bonds are a versatile tool for creating fibrous, bottlebrush&#8208;like assemblies of polymeric building blocks. However, a delicate balance of forces exists between the steric repulsion of the polymer chains and these directed supramolecular forces. In this work we have systematically investigated the influence of structural parameters of the attached polymers on the assembly behaviour of benzene trisurea (BTU) and benzene tris(phenylalanine) (BTP) conjugates in water. Polymers with increasing main chain lengths and different side chain sizes were prepared by reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (RAFT) polymerization of hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA), tri(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (TEGA) and oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (OEGA). The resulting structures were analyzed using small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Both BTU and BTP formed fibres with PHEA attached, but a transition to spherical morphologies was observed at degrees of polymerisation (DP) of 70 and above. Overall, the main chain length appeared to be a dominating factor in inducing morphology transitions. Increasing the side chain size generally had a similar effect but mainly impeded any aggregation as is the case of POEGA. Interestingly, BTP conjugates still formed fibres, suggesting that the stronger intermolecular interactions can compensate partially for the steric repulsion.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Ionic Ir(III) Cyclometalated Complexes as Photocatalysts for Light Assisted ATRP of MMA. A Combined Experimental and Mechanistic Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new family of ionic Ir(III) cyclometalated complexes with general formula [Ir(C^N)2(N^N)][Br], was designed and prepared to be assessed as photocalysts for the visible light assisted ATRP polymerization of MMA. To this purpose, our design strategy involved both: i) the decoration of the cyclometalating (C^N) and the ancillary (N^N) ligands with various electron withdrawing and/or electron donor substituents and, ii) the use of Br&#8208; as the counter anion for these cationic Ir(III) species. After an extensive screening in which the [Ir(C^N)2(N^N)][Br]&#8208;type compounds were compared to the model neutral complex fac&#8208;[Ir(ppy)3], the &#8220;fully&#8221; amino&#8208;substituted ion pairs abbreviated as [10][Br] and [11][Br], exhibited the best photocatalytic performances under irradiation with CFL lamps. It is worth noting that the outcomes of transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) experiments combined with theoretical DFT calculations, allowed to corroborate the role played by the Ir(III) complexes in the mechanism responsible the photoATRP process, and suggested the rationalization of the different performances that were highlighted by our Ir(III) catalyst in the visible light assisted photopolymerization of MMA.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks as Nano&#8208;Reservoir for Room Temperature RNA Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emerging role of Ribonucleic acids (RNAs) as therapeutics is alluring. However, RNAs are extremely labile under ambient conditions and typically need to be stored in cryogenic conditions (&#8208;20 &#7506;C to &#8208;80 &#7506;C). Hence, storage, stabilization, and transportation of RNA under ambient conditions have been an arduous task and remain an unsolved problem. In this work, a guanidinium&#8208;based ionic covalent organic framework (COF), TTGCl with nanotubular morphology, was synthesized and used as nano&#8208;reservoirs for room&#8208;temperature storage of RNA. To understand the role of the nanotubular morphology and chemical nature of TTGCl in stabilizing the RNA structure and for comparison purposes, a neutral COF, TMT&#8208;TT, is synthesized and studied. Further, density functional theory (DFT) studies confirmed non&#8208;covalent interaction between the COFs and the RNA nucleobases, facilitating reversible storage of RNA. RNA loaded in COFs was found to be resistant to enzymatic degradation when treated with RNase. Gel electrophoresis and sequencing confirmed the structural integrity of the recovered RNAs and their further processibility.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Templated Assembly of D5h&#8208;Symmetric Pd5L10&#160;Rings by Precise Ligand Angle Adjustment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a series of Pd(II)nL2n coordination rings for which nuclearity is controlled by the binding angle of the corresponding bis&#8208;monodentate bridging ligands. Judicious choice of the angle within a family of rather rigid ligands allowed for the first&#8208;time to synthesize a homoleptic five&#8208;membered Pd5L10 ring that does not require any template to form. We demonstrate that control over the ring size is maintained both in the solid&#8208;, solution&#8208;, and gas&#8208;phase. Two X&#8208;ray structures of fivemembered rings from ligands with ideal angles (yielding a perfect pentagonal ring) vs. suboptimal angles (resulting in a highly distorted structure) illustrate the importance of the correct ligand geometry. A mathematical model for estimating the expected ring size based on the ligand angle was derived and DFT computations show that ring&#8208;strain is the major factor determining the assembly outcome.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Ring Opening of a Tetracyclic Tetraphosphane with Twofold Metallocene Bridging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented and highly symmetric twofold bridged P4&#8208;cycle has been embedded into a tetracyclic bisferrocenophane scaffold. Selective P&#8722;P bond can be achieved giving straightforward access to well&#8208;defined linear P4&#8208;snippets of different polarity or ultimately all&#8208;trans polyphosphanes.







Abstract
A direct route to a doubly ferrocene bridged tetracyclic tetraphosphane 1 was developed via reductive coupling of Fe(CpPCl2)2 (2&#8201;a), where a chlorine terminated linear P4&#8208;compound 3 could be identified as an intermediate. Selective P&#8722;P bond activation was further achieved by reacting 1 with elemental selenium or [Cp*Al]4, where regioselective insertion of Se or Al atoms resulted in ferrocenylene bridged [P4Se] (4) or [P4Al] (7) moieties. Compound 7 can be transformed to a hydrogen terminated linear P4 species, 8, with protic solvents. Methylation of compound 1 with MeOTf, proceeds via intermediate formation of monomethylated species 5, which gradually produced Me2&#8208;terminated dicationic 6, again containing a linear P4&#8208;unit. Besides spectroscopic characterization, the structural details of compounds 1, 4, 6, and 8 could be determined by SC&#8208;XRD. Moreover, DFT calculations were used to rationalize the reactivity of 1, derived compounds and intermediates. As a key feature, 1 undergoes ring opening polymerization to a linear polyphosphane 9.

         <title>N&#8208;Aryl&#8208;DABCO Salts as an Unprecedented Sensing Platform for the Detection of Thiols and Selenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bright ring&#8208;opening! The first N&#8208;(cumarin&#8208;7&#8208;yl)&#8208;DABCO&#8208;based &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescent probe for thiols and selenols was designed and synthesized. Fluorescence intensity enhancement is achieved through the selective cleavage of the quaternized DABCO&#8208;ring, yielding the product with a high fluorescence quantum yield (~72&#8201;%). LODs for p&#8208;thiocresol and phenyl selenide are 22&#8197;nM and 6&#8197;nM respectively.







Abstract
Quaternary N&#8208;aryl&#8208;DABCO salts were introduced for the first time as a highly selective sensing platform for thiols and selenols. By employing this platform, a highly sensitive coumarin based &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescent probe was designed and synthesized. The probe possesses a good solubility in water, low background fluorescence, and, most importantly, demonstrates high selectivity to aryl thiols and selenols over their aliphatic counterparts and other common nucleophiles. A dramatic increase in fluorescence intensity is achieved through the selective cleavage of the quaternized DABCO&#8208;ring, yielding a piperazine derivatives with a high fluorescence quantum yield (~72&#8201;%). Moreover, stability of the probe to the most used reducing agents DTT and TCEP was demonstrated. The limits of detection for p&#8208;thiocresol and phenyl selenide were evaluated to be 22&#8197;nM and 6&#8197;nM, respectively.

The first &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(cumarin-7-yl)-DABCO-based &#8220;off-on&#8221; fluorescent probe for thiols and selenols was designed and synthesized. Fluorescence intensity enhancement is achieved through the selective cleavage of the quaternized DABCO-ring, yielding the product with a high fluorescence quantum yield (~72&#8201;%). LODs for &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-thiocresol and phenyl selenide are 22&#8197;nM and 6&#8197;nM respectively.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quaternary &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-aryl-DABCO salts were introduced for the first time as a highly selective sensing platform for thiols and selenols. By employing this platform, a highly sensitive coumarin based &#8220;off-on&#8221; fluorescent probe was designed and synthesized. The probe possesses a good solubility in water, low background fluorescence, and, most importantly, demonstrates high selectivity to aryl thiols and selenols over their aliphatic counterparts and other common nucleophiles. A dramatic increase in fluorescence intensity is achieved through the selective cleavage of the quaternized DABCO-ring, yielding a piperazine derivatives with a high fluorescence quantum yield (~72&#8201;%). Moreover, stability of the probe to the most used reducing agents DTT and TCEP was demonstrated. The limits of detection for &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-thiocresol and phenyl selenide were evaluated to be 22&#8197;nM and 6&#8197;nM, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bright Fluorescent p&#8208;Phenylene&#8208;bridged Triarylmethyl Highly Stable Diradical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two units of highly stable luminescent triarylmethyl radical (PyBTM) were bridged by p&#8208;phenylene linker. The photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;f) of the diradical (1) was decreased than the PyBTM monoradical. Adding two mesityl groups on the terminals of PyBTM&#8722;PhPyBTM diradical (2) did not improve the &#934;f, but adding two n&#8208;hexyl groups on the bridging p&#8208;phenylene (3) did greatly improve it.







Abstract
Two units of highly stable luminescent triarylmethyl radical, (3,5&#8208;dichloro&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyl)bis(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl radical (PyBTM), were bridged by p&#8208;phenylene linker. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of PyBTM&#8722;PhPyBTM was at most 0.4&#8201;% in various organic solvents. Adding two mesityl groups on the terminals did not improve the PLQY. In the MesPyBTM&#8722;PhPyBTM&#8722;Mes, the mesityl group did not worked as an electron donor unlike the previously reported monoradical MesPyBTM. However, adding two n&#8208;hexyl groups on the bridging p&#8208;phenylene did greatly improve it, and the PLQY of the PyBTM&#8722;(Hex2Ph)PyBTM was 7&#8201;% in dichloromethane and acetone, and 12&#8201;% in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) film. Twisting p&#8208;phenylene linker by hexyl groups hindered the &#960;&#8208;conjugation and suppressed the non&#8208;radiative decay of the excited state.

This review examines mono&#8208;alkylation methodologies targeting key nitrogen moieties in organic building blocks and pharmaceuticals. Focusing on chemical precision in drug discovery, it addresses challenges in achieving one&#8208;pot mono&#8208;selective N&#8208;alkylations, emphasizing sustainable alternatives to traditional alkylating agents. Categorized by alkylating agent type, the review guides researchers in selecting suitable methods for mono&#8208;selective N&#8208;alkylation.







Abstract
This review provides a comprehensive overview of mono&#8208;alkylation methodologies targeting crucial nitrogen moieties &#8211; amines, amides, and sulfonamides &#8211; found in organic building blocks and pharmaceuticals. Emphasizing the intersection of chemical precision with drug discovery, the central challenge addressed is achieving one&#8208;pot mono&#8208;selective short&#8208;chain N&#8208;alkylations (methylations, ethylations, and n&#8208;propylations), preventing undesired overalkylation. Additionally, sustainable, safe, and benign alternatives to traditional alkylating agents, including alcohols, carbon dioxide, carboxylic acids, nitriles, alkyl phosphates, quaternary ammonium salts, and alkyl carbonates, are explored. This review, categorized by the nature of the alkylating agent, aids researchers in selecting suitable methods for mono&#8208;selective N&#8208;alkylation.

         <title>Electronic Structure Analysis of the A10Tt2P6 System (A=Li&#8722;Cs; Tt=Si, Ge, Sn) and Synthesis of the Direct Band Gap Semiconductor K10Sn2P6</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From observation via DFT calculations to synthesis: The temperature dependent stability of the two isomeric structures of A10Tt2P6 (A=Li&#8722;Cs; Tt=Si&#8722;Sn) comprising ether trigonal planar TtP35&#8722; units or the dimerization product [Tt2P6]10&#8722; are calculated. Subsequently the crystal structure of K10Sn2P6 with [Sn2P6]10&#8722; dimers is predicted and synthesized accordingly. Further on property calculations reveal why compounds prefer one structure over the other.







Abstract
Investigating the relationship between atomic and electronic structures is a powerful tool to screen the wide variety of Zintl phases for interesting (opto&#8722;)electronic properties. To get an insight in such relations, the A10Tt2P6 system (A=Li&#8722;Cs; Tt=Si&#8722;Sn) was picked as model system to analyse the influence of structural motives, combination of elements and their properties on type and width of the band gaps. Those compounds comprise two interesting structural motives of their anions, which are either monomeric trigonal planar TtP35&#8722; units which are isostructural to CO32&#8722; or [Tt2P6]10&#8722; dimers which correspond to two edge&#8208;sharing TtP4 tetrahedra. The A10Tt2P6 compounds were structurally optimized for both polymorphs and subsequent frequency analysis, band structure as well as density of states calculations were performed. The Gibbs free energies were compared to determine temperature dependent stability, where Na10Si2P6, Na10Ge2P6 and K10Sn2P6 were found to be candidates for a high temperature phase transition between the two polymorphs. Additionally, the unknown, but predicted compound K10Sn2P6 was synthesized and characterized by single crystal and powder x&#8208;ray diffraction. It crystalizes in the monoclinic space group P 21/n and incorporates [Sn2P6]10&#8722; edge sharing double tetrahedra. It was determined to be a direct band gap semiconductor with a band gap of 2.57&#8197;eV.

It crystalizes in the monoclinic space group &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; 2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; and incorporates [Sn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;10&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; edge sharing double tetrahedra. It was determined to be a direct band gap semiconductor with a band gap of 2.57&#8197;eV.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Stable Self&#8208;Regenerating Organic Multi&#8208;Redox Systems derived from Bicyclic (Alkyl)(amino)carbenes (BICAACs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An extended class of organic multi&#8208;redox systems was derived from bicyclic(alkyl)amino carbenes (BICAACs).&#160;The highly&#8208;conjugated system undergoes a total of 4 redox events spanning a 1.8 V redox range.&#160;These organic compounds exhibited four different stable redox states (dication, radical cation, neutral and radical anion), and all of them were characterized either by single crystal X&#8208;ray study and/or various spectroscopic studies.&#160;Three of the four redox states are stable to air and moisture.&#160;The availability of stable multiple redox states demonstrated promise towards their efficacy in the symmetric H&#8208;cell charge/discharge cycling. Among various redox states, the dication/neutral state works efficiently and continuously for 1500 cycles in 2e&#8208;&#160;charge/discharge process outside glovebox in commercially available DMF with minimum capacity loss (retaining nearly 90% Coulombic efficiency). Surprisingly, the efficiency of the redox cycle was retained even if the system was exposed to air for 30 days when it slowly regenerated to the initial deep blue radical cation, and it exhibited another 100 charge/discharge cycles with a minimal capacity loss.&#160;Such a stable H&#8208;cell cycling ability is not well known among organic molecule&#8208;based systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Prism[2]dihydrophenazines: Synthesis, Configurational Analysis, and Supramolecular Tessellation through Exo&#8208;Wall Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocyclic arenes have gained considerable attention for their structural diversity and widespread applications. In this research, a new kind of macrocyclic arenes, namely prism[2]dihydrophenazine&#160;(anti&#8208;P2P20, syn&#8208;P2P20, and P2P22), composed of two dihydrophenazine derivatives&#160;subunits bridged by methylene groups, were conveniently synthesized by AlCl3&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot condensation in 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane. Both anti&#8208;P2P20 and its isomer syn&#8208;P2P20 exhibited flexible and convertible conformation with narrow cavity, while P2P22 possessed rigid and rhombic&#8208;like skeleton due to the more steric hindrance on subunits. In addition, the selection of electron&#8208;deficient guest was found to influence the outside binding behavior of syn&#8208;P2P20. Fantastic regular supramolecular tessellation was fabricated&#160;by tiling of syn&#8208;P2P20 with tetrafluoro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TFB) through the exo&#8208;wall interactions. Using 1,5&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzene (DFN) as a linker, only the regular 2D network superstructure with periodic units in a plane was obtained through cocrystallization. This work not only reports the construction of supramolecular tessellations by using prism[2]dihydrophenazines as building blocks, but also provides a new perspective for the design of macrocyclic arenes and fabrication of 2D supramolecular materials.</dc:description>

         <title>N,N&#8217;&#8208;Diaryl&#8208;Sulfurdiimides Are Strongly Redox Tuned</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and extensive characterization of nine aryl sulfur diimides (SDIs, Ar&#8208;NSN&#8208;Ar) are presented with a robust computational and experimental investigation of the fundamental properties of these important members of the thiazyl family of compounds, with particular attention paid to their highly tunable electrochemical behaviour. This is the first work to undertake a systematic comparison of the electrochemical profiles of a coherent series of SDIs to demonstrate and quantify the response of their reduction potentials to substituent electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing properties. This effect is found to be not only exceptionally strong, but also correlates very closely with computed orbital energies. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy is used to determine the nature, localization, and qualitative lifetimes of the radical anions of SDIs. This work also addresses significant misconceptions about physical properties of SDIs. Experimental data and modern computational methods are employed to provide a resolute answer to the long&#8208;standing contention of the solution&#8208;state conformations of SDIs, and to correct historical mistakes in the assignment of infrared spectroscopic data. High&#8208;quality crystal structures of all SDIs in this work showcase the utility of the recently introduced structural refinement software NoSpherA2, enabling full anisotropic refinement of H&#8208;atoms with accurate C&#8208;H bond lengths.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report a general, regioselective, and metal free &#947;&#8208;fluorination of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls via silyl dienol ethers that are readily prepared from simple ketones and aldehydes. The transformation displays broad scope including 27 cyclic and acyclic siloxydienes providing &#947;&#8208;fluoro compounds in 28&#8211;91% yield. Notably, the reported conditions are also suitable for the synthesis of challenging tertiary fluorides. The regioselectivity of the reaction was studied on a series of acyclic siloxydienes and was observed to be sensitive to the conformational flexibility of the substrate. Diversification of the &#947;&#8208;fluorocarbonyls demonstrates the promise of fluorine as a stereocontrol element.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N,O&#8208;acetals are found as structural motif in natural products and are important synthetic precursors for N&#8208;acylimines as building blocks in organic synthesis for C&#8208;C&#8208;bond formation and amines. For the synthesis of N,O&#8208;acetals, an acid&#8208;, base&#8208; and metal&#8208;free catalytic method is reported applying N,N&#8208;di&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropyl)&#8208;1,7&#8208;dicyano&#8208;perylen&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid imide and N,N&#8208;di&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropyl)&#8208;1,6,7,12&#8208;tetrabromo&#8208;2,5,8,11&#8208;tetracyano&#8208;perylen&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid imide as extremely electron&#8208;deficient photocatalysts. The first perylene bisimide highly selectively photocatalyzes the formation of the N,O&#8208;acetals as products in high yields, and the second and more electron&#8208;deficient perylene bisimide allows these reactions without thiophenol as H&#8208;atom transfer reagent. Calculated electron density maps support this. The reaction scope comprises different substituents at the nitrogen of the enamides and different alcohols as starting material. Dehydroalanines are converted to non&#8208;natural amino acids that shows the usefulness of this method for organic and medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ confining selenium within bubble &#8211; like carbon nanoshells for ultra&#8208;stable Li&#8722;Se batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel &#8220;top&#8211;down&#8221; approach to in&#8211;situ confine Se within bubble&#8211;like carbon frameworks to minimize the shuttle effect and volume expansion of Se cathode in Li&#8208;Se batteries. The resultant Se@void@BLNC shows a unique half&#8208;filled core&#8208;shell structure than ensures an ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance of almost 100% capacity reservation during 4000 cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;selenium (Li&#8722;Se) batteries are promising energy storage devices. However, the long&#8208;term durability and high&#8208;rate performance of the Se cathode have been limited by significant volume expansion and the troublesome shuttle effect of polyselenides during repeated charging/discharging processes. To revolutionize these issues, we applied a top&#8208;down strategy through the in&#8208;situ trapping of amorphous Se within bubble&#8208;like carbon (BLC) frameworks, which can radically minimize the presence of surface&#8208;absorbed Se while enhancing Se loading capacity. This ingenious technique successfully encapsulates all Se species within carbon nanoshells, creating a distinct half&#8208;filled core&#8208;shell structure known as Se@void@BLC. This in&#8208;situ trapping approach ensures the efficient management of Se volume changes during repeated discharge and charge cycles. Moreover, an extraordinary Se loading capacity of up to 65.6&#8197;wt% is reached. Using the Se@void@BLC as cathode for Li&#8722;Se battery, we achieve a high initial Columbic efficiency of 84.2&#8201;%, a high reversible capacity of 585&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, and an ultralow capacity decay of only 0.0037&#8201;% per cycle during 4000 cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

&lt;p&gt;This work presents a novel &#8220;top&#8211;down&#8221; approach to in&#8211;situ confine Se within bubble&#8211;like carbon frameworks to minimize the shuttle effect and volume expansion of Se cathode in Li-Se batteries. The resultant Se@void@BLNC shows a unique half-filled core-shell structure than ensures an ultra-stable cycling performance of almost 100% capacity reservation during 4000 cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Lithium-selenium (Li&#8722;Se) batteries are promising energy storage devices. However, the long-term durability and high-rate performance of the Se cathode have been limited by significant volume expansion and the troublesome shuttle effect of polyselenides during repeated charging/discharging processes. To revolutionize these issues, we applied a top-down strategy through the &lt;i&gt;in-situ&lt;/i&gt; trapping of amorphous Se within bubble-like carbon (BLC) frameworks, which can radically minimize the presence of surface-absorbed Se while enhancing Se loading capacity. This ingenious technique successfully encapsulates all Se species within carbon nanoshells, creating a distinct half-filled core-shell structure known as Se@void@BLC. This &lt;i&gt;in-situ&lt;/i&gt; trapping approach ensures the efficient management of Se volume changes during repeated discharge and charge cycles. Moreover, an extraordinary Se loading capacity of up to 65.6&#8197;wt% is reached.

         <title>Tuning the Inorganic Core of a reduced Ni2Ge2 Cluster</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We disclose convenient synthetic strategies to access highly reduced Ni2Ge2 inorganic square&#8208;type cores, identified as key motifs in catalysis. We demonstrate that the structure and bonding within the metallic core can be transformed by the addition of common Lewis bases, providing as well computational insights that will aid in the rationale preparation of these unusual clusters.







Abstract
Tetranuclear cores (M&#8722;E)2 of transition metals (M) and tetrylenes (EII=Si, Ge, Sn) are key motifs in homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. They exhibit a continuum of M&#8722;M and E&#8722;E bonding within the inorganic core that leads to a variety of structures for which there are no specific synthetic methods. Herein, we report a series of highly reduced [Ni0GeII]2 squares solely stabilized by bulky terphenyl (C6H3&#8722;2,6&#8208;Ar2) ligands, for which we provide complementary and high&#8208;yielding syntheses. Reactivity studies with common Lewis bases (carbene and CO) evince that the structure of the (M&#8722;E)2 core can be transformed. We have investigated this core modification by computational means, offering a rationale to better understand the continuum of bonding across these clusters.

         <title>Each Interruption Is an Opportunity: Novel Synthetic Strategies Explored through Interrupted Click Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemistry professor explains the mechanism of the copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8211;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) while suggesting that by interrupting the click reaction, it is possible to exploit the reactivity of the copper metallacycle intermediate to synthesize new products. The students who are listening are imagining novel synthetic pathways and finding ways to access products that are typically hard to obtain. More information can be found in the Review by M. Giustiniano, G.&#8197;C. Tron and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303844).

         <dc:description>Here, we combined magnetometry, multi&#8208;frequency electronic paramagnetic resonance, and wave function based ab initio calculations to investigate magnetic properties of two high spin Co(II) complexes Co(BDPRP) (BDPRP = 2,6&#8208;bis((2&#8208;(S)&#8208;di(4&#8208;R)phenylhydroxylmethyl&#8208;1&#8208;pyrrolidinyl)methyl)pyridine) complexes (R = H for 8; R = tBu for 9). Complexes 8 and 9 featuring effective D3h symmetry were found to possess D = 24.0 and 32.0 cm&#8211;1, respectively, in their S = 3/2 ground states of . Ligand field analyses revealed that the low&#8208;lying d&#8208;d excited states make either positive or vanishing contributions to D. Hence, total positive D values were measured for 8 and 9, as well as related D3h high spin Co(II) complexes.
In contrast, negative D values are usually observed for C3v congeners. In&#8208;depth analyses suggested that lowering symmetry from D3h to C3v induces orbital mixing between &#160;and &#160;and admixes excited state &#160;into the ground state. Both factors turn the total D value progressively negative with the increasing distance (&#948;) of the Co(II) out of the equatorial plane. Therefore, &#948; determines the sign and magnitude of final D values of five&#8208;coordinate trigonal bipyramidal S = 3/2 Co(II) complexes as measured for a series of such species with varying &#948;.</dc:description>

         <title>Cavity Catalysis of an Enantioselective Reaction under Vibrational Strong Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong light&#8208;matter interaction is emerging as an exciting tool for controlling chemical reactions. Here, we demonstrate an L&#8208;proline&#8208;catalyzed direct asymmetric Aldol reaction under vibrational strong coupling. Both the reactants (4&#8208;nitrobenzaldehyde and acetone) carbonyl bands are coupled to an infrared photon and react in the presence of L&#8208;proline. The reaction mixture is eluted from the cavity, and the conversion yields and enantiomeric excess are quantified using NMR and chiral HPLC. The conversion yields increase by up to 90% in ON&#8208;resonance conditions. Interestingly, a large increase in the conversion yield does not affect the enantiomeric excess. Further control experiments were carried out by varying the temperature, and we propose that the rate&#8208;limiting step may not be the deciding factor in enantioselectivity. Whereas the formation of the enamine intermediate is modified by cavity coupling experiments. For this class of enantioselective reactions, strong coupling does not change the enantiomeric excess, possibly due to the large energy difference in chiral transition states. Strong coupling can boost the formation of enamine intermediate, thereby favouring the product yield. This gives more hope to test polaritonic chemistry based on enantioselective reactions in which the branching ratios can be controlled.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) self&#8208;supported Ge anode is one of the promising candidates to replace the traditional graphite anode material for high&#8208;performance binder&#8208;free lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The enlarged surface area and the shorted ions/electrons transporting path length of the 3D electrode would greatly facilitate the rapid transfer of abundant lithium ions during cycling, thus achieve enhanced energy and power density during cycling. Cycle stability of the 3D self&#8208;supported Ge electrode would also be improved due to the obtained enough space could effectively accommodate the large volume expansion of the Ge anode. In this review, we first describe the electrochemical properties and Li ions storage mechanism of Ge anode. Moreover, the recent advances in the 3D self&#8208;supported Ge anode architectures design are majorly illustrated and discussed. Challenges and prospects of the 3D self&#8208;supported Ge electrode are finally provided, which shed light on ways to design more reliable 3D Ge&#8208;based electrodes in energy storage systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Neutral Multicatalytic Cerium Photoredox&#8208;Enabled Cleavage of O&#8211;H Bearing Substrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The need for synthetic methodologies capable of rapidly altering molecular structure are in high demand. Most existing methods to modify scaffolds rely on net exothermicity to drive the desired transformation. We sought to develop a general strategy for the cleavage of C&#8211;C bonds&#160;b&#160;to hydroxyl groups independent of inherent substrate strain. To this end we have applied a multicatalytic cerium photoredox&#8208;based system capable of activating O&#8211;H bonds in lactols&#160;&#160;to deliver formate esters. The same system is also capable of effecting hydrodecarboxylation and hydrodecarbonylation reactions. Initial mechanistic probes demonstrate atomic chlorine (Cl&#8226;) is generated under the reaction conditions, but substrate activation through cerium&#8208;alkoxides or &#8208;carboxylates cannot be ruled out.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) analogues of Wittig hydrocarbon, [(NHC)(Stil)(NHC)] (3a&#8208;c) (NHC = SIPr (1a) = C[N(Dipp)CH2]2, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; IPr (1b) = C[N(Dipp)CH]2; Me&#8208;IPr (1c) = C[N(Dipp)CMe]2 and Stil = C6H4CHCHC6H4) have been reported as crystalline solids. 3a&#8208;c are prepared by two&#8208;electron reductions of the corresponding bis&#8208;1,3&#8208;imidazoli(ni)um bromides [(NHC)(Stil)NHC)](Br)2 (2a&#8208;c) with KC8 in &gt;94% yields. 2a&#8208;c are accessible by the nickel catalyzed direct C&#8211;C coupling of NHCs (1a&#8208;c) with (E)&#8208;4,4&#180;&#8208;dibromostilbene. One&#8208;electron oxidation of 3a,b yields the corresponding radical cation [(NHC)(Stil)NHC)]B(C6F5)4 4a,b. The accessibility of 3a&#8208;c and 4a,b corroborates well with the cyclic voltammograms of 2a&#8208;c. All compounds have been characterized by UV&#8208;Vis/NMR/EPR spectroscopy as well as 2a, 3a, and 3b by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The electronic structures of representative systems have been analyzed by quantum chemical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Centered Reactivity of a Transition Metal Bound Geometrically Constrained Phosphine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electronic properties, coordination chemistry and reactivity of metal complexes of a planar (C2v symmetric) acridane&#8208;derived geometrically constrained phosphine, P(NNN), are described. On complexation to metal centers, the phosphine was found to adopt a distorted trigonal pyramidal structure with a high barrier to pyramidal inversion (22.3 kcal/mol at 298 K for Au[P(NNN)]Cl). Spectroscopic data and theoretical calculations carried out at the density functional level of theory indicate that P(NNN) is a moderate &#963;&#8208;donor, with significant &#960;&#8208;acceptor properties. Despite the distortion undergone by the phosphorus atom on coordination to metal centers, the P(NNN) ligand retains its ability to react with small molecule substrates with polar E&#8211;H bonds (MeOH, NH2Ph, NH3). It does so in a concerted fashion across one of the P&#8211;N bonds, and reversibly in the case of amine substrates. This cooperative bond activation chemistry may ultimately prove beneficial in catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>First Potassium Fluoroaluminate Ionic Exchanger for Rapid and Selective Removal of Sr2+ with High Capacity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>90Sr, as a typical artificial radionuclide, poses a serious threat to human health and the ecological environment. The selective removal of this radionuclide from industrial nuclear waste is very necessary for our environment. Here we report a novel potassium fluoroaluminate, K2[(AlF5)H2O], which was synthesized by a simple low&#8208;temperature one&#8208;step method. It adopts a 1D AlF6&#8208;chain structure, which consists of exchangeable potassium ions in between the infinite chains of octahedral Al centers. As a remarkable inorganic ionic exchanger, K2[(AlF5)H2O] has a high chemical stability (resistance of pH= ~3&#8208;12) and thermal stability. It possesses an excellent adsorption selectivity (Kd=~6.1&#215;104 mL&#183;g&#8722;1) and a maximum adsorption capacity of qm= ~120.32 mg&#183;g&#8722;1 for Sr2+. Importantly, it still keep a very good selectivity for Sr2+ ions even in the presence of competing Na+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ aqueous solutions. K2[(AlF5)H2O] is the first example of fluoroaluminate ionic exchange materials that can capture Sr2+. This result opens up a new way to design and synthesize inorganic ionic exchangers for the selective removal of Sr2+ ions from radioactive waste water.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Aza&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts Reaction of 1&#8208;Naphthols and Electron&#8208;Rich Phenols with Isatin&#8208;Derived Ketimines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New chiral ligands could be obtained by introducing proline moieties and imidazoline moieties to binaphthyl skeletons. The chiral ligands exhibited balanced rigidity and flexibility which could allow the change of the conformations during the reactions on one hand, and could provide sufficient asymmetric induction on the other. The proline moiety could act as a linker connecting the binaphthyl skeletons and the imidazoline moieties as well as a coordinating group for the central metal, and the electronic and steric properties of the imidazoline groups could be carefully fine&#8208;tuned by the use of different substituents. In the presence of Cu(II) catalyst bearing such chiral ligands, aza&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction of 1&#8208;naphthols and electron&#8208;rich phenols with isatin&#8208;derived ketimines provided the desired products with good to excellent yields and up to 99% ee. The reactions showed good scalability, and excellent ee could still be obtained when the reaction was carried out in gram&#8208;scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Bending a Cumulene with Electrons: Stepwise Chemical Reduction and Structural Study of a Tetraaryl[4]Cumulene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical reduction of a [4]cumulene with cesium metal was explored, and the structural changes stemming from electron acquisition are detailed using X&#8208;ray crystallography. It is found that the [4]cumulene undergoes dramatic geometric changes upon stepwise reduction, including bending of the cumulenic core and twisting of the endgroups from orthogonal to planar. The structural deformation is consistent with early theoretical reports&#160; that suggests that the twisting should occur upon reduction of both even and odd [n]cumulenes. The current results, on the other hand, are inconsistent with a previous experimental study of a [3]cumulene in which the predicted twisting is not observed upon reduction . DFT computations help to reveal that the barrier to deformation was significantly lower in a [3]cumulene than a [4]cumulene, allowing the barrier to be overcome in the solid&#8208;state.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The ability of an octanuclear cubic coordination cage to catalyse a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction on a cavity&#8208;bound guest was studied with 2,4&#8208;dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) as the guest/substrate. It was found that DNFB undergoes a catalysed reaction with hydroxide ions within the cavity of the cubic cage (in aqueous buffer solution, pH 8.6). The rate enhancement of kcat/kuncat was determined to be 23, with cavity binding of the guest being required for catalysis to occur. The product, 2,4&#8208;dinitrophenolate (DNP), remained bound within the cavity due to electrostatic stabilisation and exerts two apparently contradictory effects: it initially auto&#8208;catalyses the reaction when present at low concentrations, but at higher concentrations inhibits catalysis when a pair of DNP guests block the cavity. When encapsulated, the UV/Vis absorption spectrum of DNP is red&#8208;shifted when compared to the spectrum of free DNP in aqueous solution. Further investigations using other aromatic guests determined that a similar red&#8208;shift on cavity binding also occurred for 4&#8208;nitrophenolate (4NP) at pH 8.6. The red&#8208;shift was used to determine the stoichiometry of guest binding of DNP and 4NP within the cage cavity, which was confirmed by structural analysis with X&#8208;ray crystallography; and also used to perform catalytic kinetic studies in the solution&#8208;state.</dc:description>

         <title>3,4&#8208;Dimethylenecyclobutene: A Building Block for Design of Macrocycles with Excited State Aromatic Low&#8208;Lying High&#8208;Spin States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>3,4&#8208;Dimethylenecyclobutene (DMCB) is an unusual isomer of benzene. Motivated by recent synthetic progress to substituted derivatives of this scaffold, we carried out a theoretical and computational analysis with a particular focus on the extent of (anti)aromatic character in the lowest excited states of different multiplicities. We found that the parent DMCB is non&#8208;aromatic in its singlet ground state (S0), lowest triplet state (T1), and lowest singlet excited state (S1), while it is aromatic in its lowest quintet state (Q1) as this state is represented by a triplet multiplicity cyclobutadiene (CBD) ring and two uncoupled same&#8208;spin methylene radicals. Interestingly, the Q1 state, despite having four unpaired electrons, is placed merely 4.8 eV above S0, and there is a corresponding singlet tetraradical 0.16 eV above. The DMCB is potentially a highly useful structural motif for the design of larger molecular entities with interesting optoelectronic properties. Here, we designed macrocycles composed of fused DMCB units, and according to our computations, two of these have low&#8208;lying nonet states (i.e., octaradical states) at energies merely 2.40 and 0.37 eV above their S0 states as a result of local H&#252;ckel&#8208; and Baird&#8208;aromatic character of individual 6&#960;&#8208; and 4&#960;&#8208;electron monocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>NBN&#8208; and BNB&#8208;Phenalenyls: the Yin and Yang of Heteroatom&#8208;doped&#160;&#960; Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NBN&#8208; and BNB&#8208;doped phenalenyls are isoelectronic to phenalenyl anions and cations, respectively. They represent a pair of complementary molecules that have essentially identical structures but opposite properties as electron donors and acceptors. The NBN&#8208;phenalenyls 1&#8722;4 considered here were prepared from N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;diaminonaphthalene and readily available boron&#8208;containing building blocks (i.e., BH3&#8729;SMe2 (1), p&#8208;CF3&#8208;C6H4B(OH)2 (2), C6H5B(OH)2 (3), or MesBCl2/iPr2NEt (4)). Treatment of 1 with 4&#8208;Me2N&#8208;2,6&#8208;Me2&#8208;C6H2Li gave the corresponding NBN derivative 5. The BNB&#8208;phenalenyl 6 was synthesized from 1,8&#8208;naphthalenediyl&#8208;bridged diborane(6), PhNH2, and MesMgBr. A computational study reveals that the photoemission of 1, 4, and 5 originates from locally excited (LE) states at the NBN&#8208;phenalenyl fragments, while that of 2 is dominated by charge transfer (CT) from the NBN&#8208;phenalenyl to the p&#8208;CF3&#8208;C6H4 fragment. Depending on the dihedral angle &#952; between its Ph and NBN planes, compound 3 emits mainly from a less polar LE (&#952; &gt; 55&#176;) or more polar CT state (&#952; &lt; 55&#176;). In turn, the energetic preference for either state is governed by the polarity of the solvent used. An equimolar aggregate of the NBN&#8208; and BNB&#8208;phenalenyls 3 and 6 (in THF/H2O) shows a distinct red&#8208;shifted emission compared to that of the individual components, which originates from an intermolecular CT state.</dc:description>

         <title>A Chiral&#160;[2 + 3]&#160;Covalent Organic Cage Based on 1,1&#8217;&#8208;Bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL) Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A [2 + 3] chiral covalent organic cage is produced through a dynamic covalent chemistry approach by mixing two readily available building units, viz. an enantiopure 3,3&#8217;&#8208;diformyl 2,2&#8217;&#8208;BINOL compound (A) with a triamino spacer (B). The two enantiomeric (R,R,R) and (S,S,S) forms of the cage&#160;C&#160;are produced nearly quantitatively thanks to the reversibility of the imine linkage. The X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of cage (S,S,S)&#8208;C&#160;highlights that the six OH functions of the BINOL fragments are positioned inside the cage cavity. Upon reduction of the imine bonds of cage&#160;C, the amine cage&#160;D&#160;is obtained. The ability of the cage&#160;D&#160;to host the&#160;1&#8208;phenylethylammonium cation (EH+) as a guest&#160;is evaluated through UV, CD and DOSY NMR studies. A higher binding constant for (R)&#8208;EH+&#160;cation (Ka = 1.7 106&#160;&#177; 10 % M&#8208;1)&#160;related to (S)&#8208;EH+&#160;(Ka = 0.9 106&#160;&#177; 10 % M&#8208;1)&#160;is determined in the presence of the (R,R,R)&#8208;D&#160;cage. This enantiopreference is in close agreement with molecular dynamics simulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Phenyl Transfer from a Boronate to Lithium in the Gas Phase Reveals Crucial Role of Solvation in Transmetalations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to its behavior in solution, the adduct [(LiBr)(tBu)(Ph)Bpin]&#8211; (pin = pinacol) transfers its phenyl anion from boron to lithium upon fragmentation in the gas phase. Quantum chemical calculations predict this exceptional transmetalation to be exothermic relative to the separated reactants, [(tBu)(Ph)Bpin]&#8211; and LiBr, which we attribute to the high phenyl&#8208;anion affinity of the coordinatively unsaturated LiBr unit. The addition of a single molecule of tetrahydrofuran drastically reduces the phenyl&#8208;anion affinity of LiBr and thereby renders the transmetalation from boron to lithium endothermic. Thus, the probed system highlights the importance of solvation and ligation effects in transmetalations. For correctly predicting the direction, in which these reactions proceed, it is not sufficient to consider the electronegativities or partial charges of the involved metals or metalloids. Instead, the individual coordination states and their changes over the course of the reaction must be taken into account.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenanthrothiophene&#8208;Triazine Star&#8208;Shaped Discotic Liquid Crystals: Synthesis, Self&#8208;Assembly, and Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Fluorescence Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipophilic biphenylthiophene&#8208; and phenanthrothiophene&#8208;triazine compounds, BPTTn and CPTTn respectively, were prepared by a tandem procedure involving successive Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling and Scholl cyclodehydrogenation reactions. These compounds display photoluminescence in solution and in thin film state, solvatochromism with increasing solvent&#8217;s polarity, as well as acidochromism and metal ion recognition stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescence. Protonation of BPTT10 and CPTT10 by trifluoroacetic acid results in fluorescence quenching, which is reversibly restored once treated with triethylamine (ON&#8208;OFF switch). DFT computational studies show that intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) phenomena occurs for both molecules, and reveal that protonation enhances the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the triazine core and reduces the band gap. This acidochromic behavior was applied to a prototype fluorescent anti&#8208;counterfeiting device. They also specifically recognize Fe3+ through coordination, and the recognition mechanism is closely related to the photoinduced electron transfer between Fe3+ and BPTT10/CPTT10. CPTTn self&#8208;assemble into columnar rectangular (Colrec) mesophase, which can be modulated by oleic acid via the formation of a hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular liquid crystal hexagonal Colhex mesophase. Finally, CPTTn also form organic gels in alkanes at low critical gel concentration (3.0 mg/mL). Therefore, these star&#8208;shaped triazine molecules possess many interesting features and thus hold great promises for information processing, liquid crystal semiconductors and organogelators.</dc:description>

Protonation of BPTT10 and CPTT10 by trifluoroacetic acid results in fluorescence quenching, which is reversibly restored once treated with triethylamine (ON-OFF switch). DFT computational studies show that intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) phenomena occurs for both molecules, and reveal that protonation enhances the electron-withdrawing ability of the triazine core and reduces the band gap. This acidochromic behavior was applied to a prototype fluorescent anti-counterfeiting device. They also specifically recognize Fe3+ through coordination, and the recognition mechanism is closely related to the photoinduced electron transfer between Fe3+ and BPTT10/CPTT10. CPTTn self-assemble into columnar rectangular (Colrec) mesophase, which can be modulated by oleic acid via the formation of a hydrogen-bonded supramolecular liquid crystal hexagonal Colhex mesophase. Finally, CPTTn also form organic gels in alkanes at low critical gel concentration (3.0 mg/mL). Therefore, these star-shaped triazine molecules possess many interesting features and thus hold great promises for information processing, liquid crystal semiconductors and organogelators.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pd(0)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Intramolecular Grignard&#8208;type Reaction of Vinyl Iodide&#8722;Carbonyl</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The insertion of carbonyl into C(sp2)&#8211;Pd(II) &#963;&#8208;bond (Grignard&#8208;type addition) was not established until the 1990s. While this elemental reaction has been well explored since then, its application in Pd(0) asymmetric catalysis remain elusive. Herein, we report the Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric intramolecular Grignard&#8208;type reaction of vinyl iodide&#8211;carbonyl in the presence of HCO2H additive, affording cyclic allylic alcohol with good to excellent enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggested that besides serving as an efficient reductant, HCO2H is also capable of facilitating protonation of the involved secondary alkoxyl&#8208;Pd(II), thus completely suppressing the &#946;&#8208;H elimination. Moreover, no KIE was found in the competing reaction between vinyl iodide&#8208;aldehyde and 1&#8208;deuterated one, demonstrating the facile step of aldehyde insertion.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Complex of the Parent Phosphinidene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The diatomic molecule PH is very reactive, and it serves as the parent compound for phosphinidenes featuring a monovalent phosphorus atom. Herein, we report the characterization and reactivity of a rare hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex of PH. Specifically, the molecular complex between PH and HCl has been generated by photolysis of chlorophosphine (H2PCl) at 254 nm in a solid Ar&#8208;matrix at 10 K. The IR spectrum of the complex HP&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;HCl and quantum chemical calculations at the UCCSD(T)&#8208;F12a/haTZ level consistently prove that the phosphorus atom acts as a hydrogen bond acceptor with a binding energy (D0) of &#8211;0.6 kcal mol&#8722;1. In line with the observed absorption at 341 nm for the binary complex, the triplet phosphinidene PH undergoes prototype H&#8722;Cl bond insertion by reformation of H2PCl upon photoexcitation at 365 nm. However, this hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex is unstable in the presence of N2 and HCl, as both molecules prefers stronger interactions with HCl than PH in the observed complexes HP&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;HCl&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;N2 and HP&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;2HCl.</dc:description>

         <title>Photosensitizers Enable the Formation of Biphenyls with UV&#8208;LEDs and Sunlight</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regioselective synthesis of biphenyls, which are economically important pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and liquid crystals, is a challenging task. Current methods rely on metal&#8208;dependent cross&#8208;coupling reactions, which unfortunately require the use of harmful halogenated aryls and heavy metal catalysts that are toxic and difficult to remove from the final products. Recently, we have circumvented these problems by developing a metal&#8208;free and broadly applicable photochemical method for biphenyl synthesis using UV&#8208;C light, called photosplicing. Here we present an improved method using photosensitizers in combination with UV&#8208;B, UVA light, or sunlight. Using a high&#8208;precision flow reactor with deep&#8208;UV LEDs, we investigated the ability of commonly available organic photosensitizers to enhance the photosplicing reaction and identified a number of suitable photosensitizers with the required triplet energy. This method allows for easy batch synthesis of biaryls in borosilicate glassware and paves the way for their large&#8208;scale production without the need for flow reactors.</dc:description>
