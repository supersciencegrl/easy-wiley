         <title>Chirality Effects in Peptide&#8208;Based Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Naturally occurring peptides are almost exclusively composed of L&#8208;amino acids, and the incorporation of D&#8208;amino acids can profoundly alter their ability to fold and self&#8208;assemble. Here we explore the effects of chirality on the formation of disulfide dynamic combinatorial libraries generated by short cysteine&#8208;rich peptides. Our findings consistently show that heterochiral tripeptides form more diverse dynamic combinatorial libraries than their homochiral counterparts. The most complex library appears to encompass all possible cyclic species up to 19mers. Given that each of these species exists as a mixture of parallel and antiparallel isomers, we estimate this library to contain a total of 2,045 distinct compounds &#8211; a remarkable result considering that the library generated by the analogous homochiral peptide predominantly contains two dimers. In certain situations, peptide chirality also affects the relative stability of parallel and antiparallel isomers. Taken together, these results show that small changes in peptide chirality can be dramatically amplified through the formation of cyclic species.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescent Chromophore Construction via Through&#8208;Space Conjugation of Caprolactam and Itaconic Acid: Mechanistic Validation Enabled by 3D&#8208;Printed Architectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence characteristics are generally attributed to conjugated molecular structures. Substances exhibiting chromatic or fluorescent effects hold significant application value in functional coatings, biochemical detection, anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies, and pharmaceutical tracking due to their distinctive optical identification properties. Although numerous fluorescent materials have been developed, research on fluorescence mechanisms in low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight substances remains insufficient. This study serendipitously discovered that a simple thermal mixing reaction between caprolactam and itaconic acid can produce a fluorescent&#8208;colored metastable colloidal system. The colloid exhibits exceptional stability at ambient temperature, maintaining non&#8208;crystalline status or forming novel butterfly/leaf&#8208;like crystal structures upon cooling, with reversible colloidal characteristics through thermal cycling. Through comprehensive characterization using FT&#8208;IR, NMR, HPLC, and polarized optical microscopy, we elucidated the chromatic and fluorescent mechanisms: intermolecular hydrogen bonding networks facilitate the construction of spatial conjugation systems containing unsaturated groups, achieving photoluminescence via &#960;&#8208;electron orbital transitions. The reliability of fluorescence color generation mechanism was confirmed by 3D printing side. This material exhibits excellent solubility in common solvents and shows promising potential for developing fluorescent composites through polymer matrix incorporation.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry of Ditellurides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic combinatorial chemistry enables the exploration of reversible chemical exchange reactions. Here, we report studies on the dynamic Te&#8208;Te bond exchange of chemically and structurally diverse ditellurides using 125Te NMR spectroscopy. The results revealed rapid and unbiased equilibration, forming a consistent 1:1 distribution of reactants and products across all chemical systems. Extending to multi&#8208;component mixtures, we observed robust equilibrium formation even in complex systems involving multiple ditelluride species that can be easily distinguished by 125Te NMR spectroscopy. In line with the NMR analyses showing that the Te&#8208;Te bond exchange efficiently proceeds in various solvents, at very low temperature, in the absence of visible light and in the presence of radical scavengers, quantum chemical analyses revealed that the ditelluride&#8208;ditelluride exchange likely proceeds via a non&#8208;synchronous concerted mechanism and not via an alternative radical mechanism. Integrated NMR spectroscopic and quantum chemical analyses also showed that the efficiency of the chalcogen&#8208;chalcogen exchange involving ditellurides follows the trend Te&#8208;Te &gt; Te&#8208;Se &gt; Te&#8208;S. Overall, the results indicate that ditellurides are excellent dynamic systems that may find applications across molecular sciences.</dc:description>

         <title>Carboxyltin&#8208;Functionalized Tungstobismuthate/TiO2 Photoanodes for Enhanced Energy Storage Effect in Metal Photoelectrochemical Cathodic Protection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrochemical cathodic protection (PECCP), as a novel and environment&#8208;friendly metal anti&#8208;corrosion technology, its key challenge is to construct photoelectronic materials that can provide sustained protection under both illumination and dark. Herein, four cases of transition metal and carboxyltin&#8208;modified polyoxometalates (POMs) based on trivacant Keggin&#8208;type tungstobismuthate subunits, denoted as Bi&#8208;POMs, were designed and synthesized in aqueous solutions. The introduced carboxyl groups can anchor TiO2, and the export of electrons from POM clusters occurred, making these POM&#8208;based materials to be used in the PECCP field for the first time.Under illumination, the Bi&#8208;POM/TiO2 photoanodes were capable of cathodically polarizing 304 stainless steel (304SS) by 440&#8722;465 mV. In darkness, their coupled potentials of &#8722;197 to &#8722;175 mV were significantly lower than that of TiO2 (&#8722;97 mV), indicating the obviously enhanced dark cathodic protection effect. Precisely, the interdependence between Bi, POM, and TiO2ensures Bi&#8208;POMs to protect 304SS in seawater and provide stably and sustainably cathodic protection under intermittent light. The underlying mechanisms of PECCP were explored by a variety of experimental techniques including the femtosecond transient absorption measurements and density functional theory calculations. The integration of POMs into the PECCP system represents a new insight in the development of green metal protection technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Singlet Oxygen Monitoring in Aqueous Media Comprising a Polymer&#8208;imbedded Eu3+ Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Singlet dioxygen (1O2) plays a pivotal role as the active agent in photodynamic therapy (PDT) for cancer treatment, as well as in the photo&#8208;inactivation of antibiotic&#8208;resistant microbes (antimicrobial photodynamic therapy, aPDT). The ability to sensitively monitor the production and behavior of &#185;O&#8322; following its photo&#8208;catalytic generation is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies. Optical sensor molecules that respond to &#185;O&#8322; through changes in absorption or, more sensitively, fluorescence, are suitable choices. While most monitors report 1O2 via altered absorption spectra, only few compounds respond by the onset of fluorescence, even fewer based on lanthanide luminescence. By embedding a novel lanthanide complex (Eu3+) into polystyrene nanoparticles (beads), we achieved close to a 500&#8208;fold emission intensity boost in the presence of 1O2, very long decay times of up to 879 &#181;s and unprecedented stability in acidic and basic media. Furthermore, the beads present a high surface charge (&gt; +30 mV), yielding stable aqueous dispersions, which we exploited in a preliminary &#8216;proof of principle&#8217; staining experiment of (negatively charged) bacterial surfaces. The straightforward synthesis circumvents intricate preparative steps and restrictive costs. The decay characteristics furthermore pave the road to time gated measurements, i.e., to the suppression of interfering autofluorescence from biological samples.</dc:description>

         <title>B/N&#8208;Codoped Porous Carbons as Metal&#8208;Free and Binder&#8208;Free Electrode Material for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A facile, cost&#8208;effective and eco&#8208;friendly approach for the synthesis of B/N co&#8208;doped porous carbon materials has been developed for metal&#8208;free and binder&#8208;free supercapacitors. A set of samples, CPFD&#8208;B/N&#8208;5, CPFD&#8208;B/N&#8208;10and CPFD&#8208;B/N&#8208;15 have been synthesized by carbonization of a phloroglucinol&#8208;formaldehyde&#8208;dopamine (PFD) polymer and tetraethyl orthosilicate. Boric acid has been used to introduce different amounts of boron and an undoped sample, CPFD&#8208;N, has been synthesized for comparison. The CPFD materials function as binder&#8208;free electrodes and display excellent electrochemical behaviour. The optimization of boron as a heteroatom with a rational distribution of pores enables CPFD&#8208;B/N&#8208;10 electrode to achieve a high capacitance of 962 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. It demonstrates excellent rate capability and exceptional cycling stability, retaining over 120% of its capacitance after 5,000 cycles at a current density of 30 A/g.

A solid&#8208;state symmetric supercapacitor made from the material achieves a capacitance of 622 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g, Coulombic efficiency of 89% after 1,500 cycles and powers a 3 V LED bulb.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A facile, cost-effective and eco-friendly approach for the synthesis of B/N co-doped porous carbon materials has been developed for metal-free and binder-free supercapacitors. A set of samples, CPFD-B/N-5, CPFD-B/N-10and CPFD-B/N-15 have been synthesized by carbonization of a phloroglucinol-formaldehyde-dopamine (PFD) polymer and tetraethyl orthosilicate. Boric acid has been used to introduce different amounts of boron and an undoped sample, CPFD-N, has been synthesized for comparison. The CPFD materials function as binder-free electrodes and display excellent electrochemical behaviour. The optimization of boron as a heteroatom with a rational distribution of pores enables CPFD-B/N-10 electrode to achieve a high capacitance of 962 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. It demonstrates excellent rate capability and exceptional cycling stability, retaining over 120% of its capacitance after 5,000 cycles at a current density of 30 A/g. It has a specific energy density of 108.22 Wh/kg and a power output of 450.00 W/kg at 1 A/g, effectively bridging the gap between supercapacitors and batteries. A solid-state symmetric supercapacitor made from the material achieves a capacitance of 622 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g, Coulombic efficiency of 89% after 1,500 cycles and powers a 3 V LED bulb.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Asymmetric Reductive Amination Synthesis of Ritlecitinib Using (S)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Methylbenzylamine as Chiral Auxiliary</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free synthesis of ritlecitinib employs asymmetric reductive amination via a chiral auxiliary with titanium(IV) ethoxide/sodium tetrahydroborate (Ti(OEt)&#8324;/NaBH&#8324;). This one&#8208;pot process couples a ketone&#8208;amino acid with (S)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylbenzylamine (85% yield, 86:14 dr). Cyclization affords a &#948;&#8208;lactam (60%), transformed into ritlecitinib via a five&#8208;step sequence (62% overall yield), avoiding precious metals and hazardous reagents in chiral piperidine assembly.








Abstract
We present a new synthesis of ritlecitinib, employing asymmetric reductive amination via a chiral auxiliary group combined with intramolecular amide formation. This method employs a titanium(IV) ethoxide/sodium tetrahydroborate (Ti(OEt)&#8324;/NaBH&#8324;) reductive system to achieve a one&#8208;pot condensation&#8208;reduction of the ketone&#8208;amino acid derivative with (S)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylbenzylamine, resulting in an 85% yield of the di&#8208;amino acid derivative with a diastereomeric ratio of 86:14. The incorporation of a chiral auxiliary substantially enhances the diastereopurity. Subsequently, acetic acid&#8208;mediated cyclization then forms the &#948;&#8208;lactam in 60% yield. This lactam is converted to ritlecitinib via a five&#8208;step sequence in 62% overall yield. This approach effectively circumvents the use of precious metal catalysts or hazardous reagents for constructing the chiral piperidine moiety, which were essential components in prior synthetic route.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Process for Preparing Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Composites Based on Carbon&#8208;Based Quantum Dots and Their Derivatives as Drug Delivery Systems for Andrographolide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Andrographolide (ADG) was conjugated with MOFs (MIL&#8208;53(Al), ZIF&#8208;8) carbon&#8208;based quantum dots (CBQDs) and doped carbon&#8208;based quantum dots (D&#8208;CBQDs) using the green approach of high&#8208;pressure (0.3&#160;GPa) solid phase contact.

Abstract
Andrographolide (ADG) was conjugated with MIL&#8208;53(Al), ZIF&#8208;8, carbon&#8208;based quantum dots (CBQDs) and doped carbon&#8208;based quantum dots (D&#8208;CBQDs) using high&#8208;pressure (0.3&#160;GPa) contact. This solvent&#8208;free approach is environmentally friendly, energy&#8208;efficient, and time&#8208;saving, resulting in ADG&#8208;MOFs&#8208;CBQDs/D&#8208;CBQDs with physical properties comparable to those produced by traditional liquid phase encapsulation. The resulting nanocomposites were characterized using SEM, XRD, TGA, FT&#8208;IR, and 1H NMR. The results indicate that ADG was partly encapsulated within the metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) pores, while another portion was bound externally to CBQD/D&#8208;CBQDs, as evidenced by distinct drug signals in each analysis. This green synthesis approach simplifies the conjugation process. It significantly enhances the drug solubility, as indicated by changes in hydrophobicity observed via 1H NMR, surpassing the improvements achieved by ADG encapsulation within MOFs alone. Additionally, in preliminary tests, the materials exhibited significant cytotoxicity against PC3 cells compared to ADG (25.05&#160;&#177;&#160;0.06&#160;&#181;g/mL) after 48&#160;hours of exposure.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Fixation of CO2 to Form N&#8208;Containing Heterocyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the research progress of various typical N&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds in the past five years, detailing the catalytic performance and principles of promising catalysts. Finally, this pathway's development trends and characteristics are summarized and prospected.








Abstract
N&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds are common chemical structures in drugs, bioactive compounds, and natural products. Using CO2 as a C1 source for synthesizing N&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds aligns with the concepts of green chemistry and sustainability. In recent years, the synthesis of N&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds has been extensively and intensively studied. However, significant challenges remain, such as thermodynamic limitations, low catalytic efficiency, and harsh reaction conditions. Catalysts play an essential role in the catalytic activation of CO2 and/or substrates, thereby facilitating CO2 conversion. This review provides an overview of several typical N&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds converted from CO2, such as oxazolidinones, quinazoline&#8208;2,4(1H,3H)&#8208;diones, benzimidazoles, and benzimidazolones. The most recent catalysts used in these reactions are discussed, emphasizing their mechanistic roles in the reaction process.

         <title>Synthesis of a Station&#8208;Less Molecular Daisy Chain</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A daisy chain compound lacking intercomponent recognition motifs is synthesized and analyzed. As a result of the absence of intercomponent recognition motifs there was also no preferred conformation of the interlocked components observed.








Abstract
A daisy chain architecture without a preferred low energy arrangement of the mechanically linked components is presented. The molecular design combines a rigid&#8208;rod type oligophenylene ethynylene subunit with an oligoethylene glycol macrocycle that features a bipyridine coordination site. The daisy chain dimer was synthesized via kinetic trapping of the interlocked structure using a Cadiot&#8211;Chodkiewicz active metal template reaction. Comparison of the isolated interlocked dimer with its monomeric analogue indicates the presence of a variety of different geometries for the molecular daisy chain. The dynamic sliding motion in the daisy chain is studied by variable temperature UV&#8211;vis and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy experiments, which point to a highly mobile system even at low temperatures.

         <title>Recent cutting&#8208;edge technologies for the delivery of peptide nucleic acid.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) have garnered significant attention due to their enhanced chemical, physical, and binding properties in comparison to natural nucleic acids. This prompted their application in antigene/antisense approach, assigning them a pivotal role in gene editing and, more recently, showing their potential as &#8220;bilingual&#8221; molecules being able &#8220;to speak&#8221; both nucleic acid and protein language. However, in order to expand the applications of PNAs in therapy, the challenge of effectively delivering PNAs to cells needs to be addressed. Among several delivery approaches employed so far, the nanotechnology&#8208;based ones showed great potential. In this review, we provide an overview of the latest in the field (2019 to present), beginning from the &#8220;old fashioned&#8221; peptide&#8208;based delivery systems, as well as cutting&#8208;edge approaches involving nanoparticles, liposomes, calixarene, showing how they have inspired the development of smarter delivery approaches to boost PNAs applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Quercetin&#183;Zirconium Metal Complexes: Insights from Femto to Millisecond Photobehavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal complexation modulates the antioxidant properties of many flavonoids, including quercetin (QRT). However, competition between the antioxidant and autoxidation processes limits their longevity. This necessitates a deeper understanding of the fate of QRT phenoxy radicals following antioxidant activity. Here, we report on the formation of QRT&#183;Zr complexes and their photobehaviors, which account for the photochemical reactivity of the generated radicals. In methanol, N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide, and water, the UV&#8208;visible absorption spectra of the 1:1 and 1:2 complexes exhibit a significant bathochromic shift (50 &#8208; 100 nm) and high global binding constants (1 &#8208; 14 &#180; 109 M&#8208;2). While the formation of charge&#8208;transfer states through ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer in the ground state prevents the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer that typically occurs in QRT, it leads to the generation of excited metal&#8208;bound ligand radicals. We present details on the dynamics and further relaxation from femto to millisecond regimes of the excited complexes and generated species. The lifetimes of the formed radicals are considerably shorter than those of the free QRT radicals due to rapid back electron transfer, regenerating the neutral complexes. These findings will facilitate the design of other systems for antioxidant activity, photocatalysis, and various applications in chemistry, biochemistry, and biomedicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional Nano&#8208;COF&#8208;Embedded Silica Composite for Efficient Photocatalytic NADH Regeneration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photocatalytic regeneration of NADH represents an effective means of mimicking photosynthesis, but confronts the challenges of the charge separation, electron transfer, and the selectivity control in the surface reduction stage. Herein, we report a multifunctional composite material that embeds &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked nano TPTTA covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and electron mediator (rhodium complex) into a functional mesoporous silica matrix for photocatalytic NADH regeneration. This strategy enables the facilitation of the electron transfer process while maintaining the intrinsic properties of the COFs, providing flexibility in COFs design. The strategic integration of electron mediator and the shortened charge migration path due to the nanosized COFs results in a NADH regeneration yield of 75.7% and a selectivity of 89.8% for 1,4&#8208;NADH. The initial reaction rate for NADH regeneration attained 8.7 gNADH&#8226;gCat&#8208;1&#8226;h&#8208;1, and the system showed no decrease in activity after 4 reaction cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Role of Symmetry to Dictate Pathway&#8208;driven Self&#8208;assembly in Photoresponsive Peptide Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive peptides offer interesting structural space in the realm of emergent pathway&#8208;driven supramolecular polymerization toward designing functional nanomaterials with precision structure&#8208;functional characteristics. However, the role of molecular symmetry in such peptides to govern the self&#8208;assembly pathway dynamics remains less explored. We design amyloid&#8208;inspired, azobenzene&#8208;functionalized symmetric (P1) and asymmetric (P2) peptide amphiphiles in the E form of azobenzene motif to systematically investigate the interplay of molecular symmetry, solvent composition and temperature to guide supramolecular organization. Spectroscopic and microscopic analyses reveal distinct aggregation pathways, with E&#8208;P1 exhibiting rapid nucleation&#8208;elongation toward kinetically stable nanofibers, while E&#8208;P2 assembles into a kinetic state (E&#8208;P2(KS)) that subsequently transforms into thermodynamically favored nanoribbons, E&#8208;P2(TS) via a "good and bad solvent" modulation strategy. Further, E&#8208;P1 remains structurally resilient due to stronger intermolecular interactions. Interestingly, E&#8208;P2 demonstrates reversible E&#8594;Z photoisomerization in both kinetic and thermodynamic states, facilitating supramolecular disassembly while retaining the self&#8208;organization memory. Notably, the activation energy barriers for Z&#8594;E isomerization in P2 differ between its kinetic and thermodynamic states, underscoring the role of pathway complexity and molecular symmetry in peptide assembly. These insights advance the understanding of symmetry&#8208;regulated supramolecular assembly to modulate the emergent functional properties for potential applications in nanotechnology and biomaterials.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Activating&#160;immunogenic cell death (ICD) represents a promising therapeutic strategy for tumor immunotherapy. However, photodynamic therapy (PDT)&#8208;mediated ICD effect&#160;is&#160;severely limited due to the extremely short half&#8208;life and limited diffusion radius&#160;of&#160;reactive oxygen species&#160;(ROS),&#160;hindering&#160;effective endoplasmic reticulum&#160;(ER)&#160;stress induction.&#160;In addition, targeted therapy of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains&#160;hugely challenging&#160;due to the lack of expression of multiple receptors.&#160;Herein, we constructed a&#160;hierarchical targeting and controllable&#160;intelligent nanodelivery material Da&#8208;CD@CET@CQ&#160;based on poly&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin with remarkable solubility and stability, loaded with a novel&#160;photosensitized ICD inducer CET&#160;and autophagy inhibitor chloroquine&#160;(CQ). Excitingly, Da&#8208;CD@CET@CQ NPs can accurately recognize TNBC tumor cells under the&#160;mediation of SRC protein. Moreover, CET could&#160;achieve observable enrichment in the ER&#160;and amplify the ICD effect&#160;by in situ&#160;ER PDT, which&#160;is further strengthened by the autophagy&#160;inhibition caused by CQ. All results show that Da&#8208;CD@CET@CQ NPs&#160;exhibited excellent&#160;targeting ability to&#160;tumor cells and ER&#160;and effectively enhanced synergistic immunotherapy of in situ&#160;ER&#160;PDT combined with autophagy inhibition, which&#160;significantly inhibited tumor growth and metastasis.&#160;Overall, our study&#160;provides&#160;a novel strategy and&#160;meaningful guideline&#160;for targeted PDT&#160;synergistic immunotherapy of&#160;TNBC.</dc:description>

         <title>FORMATION OF GOLD&#8208;ASTATINE BONDS IN N&#8208;HETEROCYCLIC CARBENE COMPLEXES</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the purpose of exploring alternatives to the poorly stable astatoaryl bond found in most 211At&#8208;labeled radiopharmaceuticals, the coordination between astatine and metal&#8208;NHC (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) complexes was investigated. To orient this work, relativistic DFT calculations were performed, highlighting a superiority of gold(I) over rhodium(I) and iridium(I), both regarding the strength of the metal&#8208;astatine bond and the metal&#8217;s preference for astatine over other halogens. The DFT calculations also revealed a more stable metal&#8208;astatine bond with electron withdrawing NHCs. Accordingly, two Au(I) complexes, [AuCl(IPr)] (IPr = N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis[2,6&#8208;(di&#8208;isopropyl)phenyl]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) and [AuCl(IAd)] (IAd = N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis[adamantyl]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) were radiolabelled by halide exchange in excellent radiochemical yields with iodine&#8208;125 and astatine&#8208;211 in a water/acetonitrile mixture with a reducing agent. While the adamantyl substituted complex was not investigated further due to its lack of solubility in aqueous or semi aqueous media, the stability of [Au211At(IPr)] in presence of phosphate buffered saline was evaluated and proved excellent (96% after two half&#8208;lives) encouraging further studies with relevant cancer targeting vectors.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Structure and Catalytic Mechanism of the cis&#8208;Eunicellane Cyclase AriE</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal structure of a cis&#8208;eunicellane cyclase, AriED128A, was determined through X&#8208;ray crystallography. Structure&#8208;guided mutagenesis explored the cyclization mechanism of AriE, in which W73 is a crucial regulatory hotspot that controls product diversity through cation&#8208;&#960; interactions. Our research provides the first structural insights into eunicellane cyclases and demonstrates the potential of engineering variants for selective product formation.








Abstract
Eunicellane diterpenoids, with over 360 known examples characterized by a cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;6/10&#8208;bicyclic carbon skeleton, exhibit diverse biological activities. To date, five eunicellane cyclases (ECs) have been reported: cis&#8208;ECs (Bnd4, CpDTS2 and EcTPS1) and trans&#8208;ECs (AlbS and MicA), yet the structural basis and molecular mechanisms governing their distinct cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;cyclization modes remain unsolved. Here, we present the crystal structure of a cis&#8208;EC AriE from Amycolatopsis arida, which catalyzes geranylgeranyl diphosphate to form cis&#8208;6/10&#8208;fused bicyclic benditerpe&#8208;2,6,15&#8208;triene (1) in aridacin biosynthesis. Through surface entropy reduction, we obtained the 1.87 &#197; resolution structure of AriED128A. Structure&#8208;guided mutagenesis identified W73 as a key regulatory hotspot controlling product diversity, with its variants generating diverse diterpene products. Y203A converted AriE into a highly specific (&#8211;)&#8208;(R)&#8208;cembrene A synthase. Our findings provide the first structural insights into this type of terpene synthase and demonstrate the feasibility of engineering EC variants for selective product formation.

         <dc:description>Naphthoxy&#8208;imine pyridine zinc and magnesium complexes were synthesized and fully characterized by NMR. In the presence of an alcohol as initiator, both complexes promoted the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of L&#8208;lactide (L&#8208;LA), &#949;&#8208;caprolactone (&#949;&#8208;CL), &#946;&#8208;butyrolactone (&#946;&#8208;BL), trimethylene carbonate (TMC) and 1&#8208;methyl trimethylene carbonate (Me&#8208;TMC), which was purposely synthesized from CO2 and the appropriate diol. The zinc complex exhibited notably high activity, particularly in the polymerization of lactide and trimethylene carbonate, and was subsequently employed in the synthesis of polytrimethylene carbonate&#8208;based diblock and random copolymers with both &#949;&#8208;caprolactone and L&#8208;lactide. Furthermore, the zinc complex demonstrated its ability to close the life cycle of the synthesized materials by successfully depolymerizing both PTMC and its copolymers.</dc:description>

         <title>&#414;6&#8208;Fluoranthene Complexes from the Reactions of Osmacyclopentadienes with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stepwise alkyne cyclotrimerizations were demonstrated at Os metal center. Paramagnetic osmacyclopentadiene complexes were the key intermediates and novel &#951;6&#8208;fluoranthene complexes of osmium were produced.








Abstract
Osmacyclopentadiene complexes were obtained from the reactions between OsCl2(PPh3)3 and 1,8&#8208;dialkynyl naphthalene compounds. These complexes exhibited paramagnetism as they adopted triplet ground states. Reactions of osmacyclopentadienes with alkynes were investigated, which produced novel &#951;6&#8208;fluoranthene complexes, showing their potential in organometallic synthesis.

         <title>Push and Pull: The Impact of Amino and Nitro Substituents on Heteroleptic Cu(I) Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents the synthesis and characterization of four novel heteroleptic Cu(I) complexes incorporating nitro&#8208; and amino&#8208;substituted phenanthroline ligands. Their molecular structures, featuring a substituent at the 5&#8208;position of the phenanthroline backbone, were elucidated by X&#8208;ray crystallography and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Spectroscopic and electrochemical investigations revealed distinct mesomeric (M) and inductive (I) effects of the NO&#8322; and NH&#8322; substituents on the photophysical and electrocnic properties. The electron&#8208;withdrawing NO&#8322; group (&#8208;M, &#8208;I) stabilizes the LUMO, shifts the reduction potential by +0.9 V and completely quenches emission via non&#8208;radiative deactivation processes. In contrast, the electron&#8208;donating NH&#8322; group (+M, &#8208;I) induces a moderate redshift (&#8776;25 nm) in absorption and leads to long&#8208;lived, non&#8208;emissive excited states, particularly in CunNH&#8322; (25.9 &#181;s). Photocatalytic tests revealed no hydrogen evolution, but NH&#8322;&#8208;substituted complexes efficiently generated singlet oxygen (&#185;O&#8322;) with quantum yields up to 39.8%. These findings demonstrate how small structural and electronic modifications can fundamentally alter the photophysics and reactivity of Cu(I) complexes, providing valuable design principles for next&#8208;generation photosensitizers.</dc:description>

         <title>Interesting Aromaticity of Franck&#8211;Condon Excited States of Cyclo[16]Carbon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic structure and aromaticity of Franck&#8211;Condon excited states of cyclo[16]carbon (C16) have been investigated. The results show that at the ground&#8208;state (S0 state) geometry, C16 exhibits aromaticity not only in triplet states (T1(in&#8594;out), T2(out&#8594;out), and T3(in&#8594;in)), but also more pronounced in the quintet&#160;state (Q1 state). Quantitatively, C16 is about three times more aromatic in the quintet&#160;state than in the triplet states.








Abstract
Inspired by the realization of cyclo[16]carbon (C16) and driven by curiosity about its properties in excited states, a comprehensive theoretical study was conducted on the aromatic characteristics in the Franck&#8211;Condon states of C16. This work demonstrates that at the ground&#8208;state (S0 state) geometry, C16 exhibits aromaticity not only in the triplet states (T1(in&#8594;out), T2(out&#8594;out), and T3(in&#8594;in)), but also more prominently in the quintet&#160;state (Q1 state), and different electronic transition modes result in different essential sources of aromaticity for each excited state. Quantitatively, C16 is about three times more aromatic in the quintet&#160;state than in the triplet states.&#160;These conclusions are supported by multiple robust indicators such as atomic force, induced current, and magnetic shielding, from qualitative, quantitative, and graphical perspectives.

         <title>Tailored Self&#8208;Assembled Biomimetic Nanofibers for Light&#8208;Driven &#946;&#8208;lactam Antibiotics Degradation in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an artificial biomimetic micellar system that integrates photothermal agents and ionic copper catalytic sites with spatially controlled positioning on a fiber&#8208;like crystalline scaffold via a crystal&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly method. Tailored photothermal&#8208;assisted antibiotic degradation (PAD) nanofibers achieve efficient &#946;&#8208;lactam degradation in deionized water, offering a sustainable solution for wastewater treatment and environmental remediation.








Abstract
The overuse of antibiotics in China and the resulting rise in antibiotic resistance pose an urgent need for effective antibiotic degradation in water. Developing artificial systems that mimic the catalytic efficiency of natural photoactive enzymes for this purpose remains a critical challenge. Despite decades of research, there is a notable scarcity of precisely designed scaffolds that can replicate the structural and functional efficiency of natural enzymes for waterborne antibiotic degradation, particularly at the nano&#8208; to micrometer scale. In this study, we present a core&#8208;corona type fiber&#8208;like micellar system designed for photothermal&#8208;assisted &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotic degradation (PAD) in water. This system integrates photothermal molecular chromophores (zinc porphyrin) and ionic copper degradation catalysts in close proximity within grafted solvophilic coronal chains on the surface of fiber&#8208;like crystalline scaffold. By employing a living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) strategy, we fine&#8208;tune the composition, dimensions, and antibiotic degradation performance of the PAD nanofibers. The tailored colloidal stable PAD nanofibers achieve a penicillin G degradation rate of 0.35 min&#8722;1 per micromole of copper under simulated sunlight irradiation (AM 1.5) in deionized water, offering a promising platform for sustainable environmental remediation.

         <title>Nitro&#8208;Group &#960; System Drives the Interaction of RRx&#8208;001 with Electrons in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of cluster experiments, transient absorption spectroscopy, and NMR spectroscopy with theory enables tracking of the chemistry induced by secondary low&#8208;energy electrons to RRx&#8208;001 in solution from the initial interaction to the final radiolysis products. The catalytic and state&#8208;selective nature of the LEE interaction is identified, with consequences for the understanding of the LEE action in radiation damage in&#160;general.








Abstract
Reactivity toward low&#8208;energy electrons (LEE) has been hypothesized as a cause of radio&#8208;modifying properties for various molecules. LEE's transient nature, however, prevents the establishment of clear links between initial processes at the sub&#8208;ps time scale and the final products of radiolysis. Here, such links are explored for the radio&#8208;modifying compound RRx&#8208;001 (1&#8208;bromoacetyl&#8208;3,3&#8208;dinitroazetidine).
Picosecond pulse radiolysis demonstrates the high scavenging capacity of the molecule for secondary quasi&#8208;free and solvated electrons forming stable parent anions confirmed by studies of microsolvated RRx&#8208;001 in clusters. The anions decay either via auto&#8208;detachment of an electron or dissociate involving hydrogen transfer from solvent, resulting in NO2 and 1&#8208;(bromoacetyl)&#8208;3&#8208;nitroazetidine. Surprisingly, no Br dissociation is observed despite its high electron affinity. We assign this behavior to the &#8220;inaccessibility&#8221; of sigma virtual states for electrons in the solvent, which can be of a general nature.

         <title>2D MOF Nanozyme&#8208;Enhanced Impedance Detector for Synergistic Biofilm Detection and Removal in Bioelectrochemical Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a dual&#8208;functional 2D Cu&#8208;BDC nanozyme&#8208;based impedance detector for simultaneous biofilm detection and elimination. The detector achieves sensitive impedance response for biofilm monitoring and enables efficient biofilm clearance via peroxidase&#8208;like activity. This approach offers a novel strategy for improving MFCs efficiency through integrated biofilm real&#8208;time detection and elimination.








Abstract
The formation of biofilm has become a significant influencing factor to microbial fuel cells (MFCs). Developing effective biofilm detection means are highly imperative for improving the efficiency of MFCs. In this study, we propose a 2D metal&#8208;organic framework (2D Cu&#8208;BDC) nanozyme&#8208;based impedance detector for the simultaneous detection and removal of bacterial biofilms. The promising induction interface features good electron transfer and biofilm attachment properties, realizing sensitive biofilm detection. The impedance response change on the functionalized 2D Cu&#8208;BDC detector was 3.5 times higher for Gram&#8208;positive bacteria biofilm and 2.7 times higher for Gram&#8208;negative bacteria biofilm compared to bare electrodes. In addition, the 2D Cu&#8208;BDC nanozyme demonstrates robust peroxidase&#8208;like activity, enabling efficient biofilm degradation&#160;at low H2O2 concentration, and further allowing for real&#8208;time monitoring of the biofilm elimination process. This study provides a novel approach to using MOF&#8208;based biosensors for the simultaneous detection and removal of biofilm in MFCs.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Enabled Pathway Complexity in Supramolecular Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, we report a unique pathway complexity in supramolecular hydrogels. We demonstrate that chemical reduction followed by oxidation creates a kinetically trapped state, which evolves into various network structures, morphologies, and macroscopic stiffness.








Abstract
Pathway complexity in supramolecular assemblies presents a unique opportunity for a single, relatively simple system to exhibit a wide range of properties allowing for multifunctionality. In this study, we report redox&#8208;enabled pathway complexity in amino acid&#8208;functionalized perylene diimides (PDIs) and its consequence for the macroscopic hydrogel network. We show that chemical reduction and subsequent oxidation enable a kinetically trapped state which transforms into different network morphologies in response to heat and time. Our finding that pathway complexity in supramolecular systems can alter bulk material properties suggests the potential for future development of dynamic materials that achieve multiple macroscopic functions with a single building block.

         <title>The Role of Asparagine as a Gatekeeper Residue in the Selective Binding of Rare Earth Elements by Lanthanide&#8208;Binding Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lanthanide binding tags (LBTs) have been utilized as a green extractant to selectively separate rare earth elements (REEs). We reveal up from the molecular level how the N5 asparagine residue is indispensable in imparting selective complexation between lighter and heavier lanthanides by conformationally functioning as a gate. We demonstrate that for the smaller Ln3+ cations&#160;like Lu3+ the gate remains locked by an inter&#8208;arm hydrogen bond between N5 and E14 residues, locking the binding pocket. In contrast, for larger Ln3+ cations like La3+, the gate is open, allowing water to infiltrate inside the pocket.








Abstract
Lanthanide&#8208;binding tag (LBT) peptides selectively complex lanthanide cations (Ln3+) in their binding pockets and are promising for lanthanide separation. However, designing LBTs that selectively target specific Ln3+ cations remains a challenge due to limited molecular&#8208;level understanding and control of interactions within the lanthanide&#8208;binding pocket. In this study, we reveal that the N5 asparagine residue acts as a gatekeeper in the binding pocket, resulting in a 100&#8208;fold selectivity for smaller Lu3+ over larger La3+ cations. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations show that the N5 residue weakly binds to the larger La3+ cation, permitting H2O molecules inside the pocket. For the smaller Lu3+ cations, the N5 residue forms an inter&#8208;arm hydrogen bond with the E14 glutamic acid residue, locking the Lu3+ cation in the pocket and preventing H2O infiltration. Mutating the N5 asparagine to a D5 aspartic acid prevents such a hydrogen bond, eliminating the gatekeeping mechanism and precipitously reducing selectivity. The resulting binding affinity to Ln3+ cations is non&#8208;monotonic but generally increases with cation size. These results suggest a molecular design paradigm: the reduced affinity for larger lanthanides is due to open pocket conformations, while the selectivity of smaller Ln3+ cations over larger ones is due to the gatekeeping hydrogen bond.

Mutating the N5 asparagine to a D5 aspartic acid prevents such a hydrogen bond, eliminating the gatekeeping mechanism and precipitously reducing selectivity. The resulting binding affinity to Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; cations is non-monotonic but generally increases with cation size. These results suggest a molecular design paradigm: the reduced affinity for larger lanthanides is due to open pocket conformations, while the selectivity of smaller Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; cations over larger ones is due to the gatekeeping hydrogen bond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dinitrogen Splitting without Barrier or Visible Light&#8208;Driven: Reactions of Vanadium Trimers and Dimers with Dinitrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Striking differences between the reactivity of vanadium atoms, dimers, and trimer clusters were revealed by matrix isolation experiments. Vanadium atoms only form weakly bound N2 complexes, but the V3 cluster splits the NN triple bond to give a V3N2 cluster. The V2 dimer requires visible light irradiation to form two isomeric V2N2 clusters with and without V&#9472;V bond. The results demonstrate the potential of clusters for N2 conversion.








Abstract
The reaction of V atoms and small clusters with dinitrogen has been investigated by matrix isolation in solid Ne and by complementary quantum chemical calculations. The experiments disclose striking differences between the reactivity of V atoms, dimers, and trimers toward dinitrogen. Whereas V atoms react only by formation of complexes, both V2 and V3 react by cleavage of the N2 triple bond to form nitride clusters. Whereas V3 reacts immediately at the conditions of matrix deposition, the reaction of V2 requires activation by irradiation with visible light. There is evidence for two isomers of V2N2, a planar one with a 5Au electronic term and a long V&#9472;V distance, and a folded one with a 1A1 term and a short V&#9472;V distance. Furthermore, there are also complexes of V2 and V3 with N2 that contain activated N2 units.

         <title>Efficient Deep&#8208;Blue TADF Emission from Multiheteroatom&#8208;doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Embedded with Dual B&#8208;O Covalent Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boron&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have demonstrated exceptional potential in the development of high&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this study, we propose a novel strategy for constructing PAH structures with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties by incorporating boron&#8208;oxygen (B&#8208;O) covalent bonds, as opposed to doping isolated boron atoms. The newly designed multiheteroatom&#8208;doped molecule, BNB&#8208;OPTZ, was synthesized via a demethylation&#8208;directed, lithium&#8208;free methodology, achieving an impressive one&#8208;pot yield exceeding 80%. BNB&#8208;OPTZ adopts a symmetric distorted semi&#8208;planar rigid conformation. Theoretical calculations reveal its long&#8208;range charge transfer characteristics. The molecule exhibits deep blue emission with a peak wavelength of 441 nm in toluene solution, accompanied by CIE coordinates of (0.14, 0.05). Notably, the blue OLED device using BNB&#8208;OPTZ achieved a remarkable external quantum efficiency of 23.1%. These findings suggest that the incorporation of B&#8208;O covalent bonds into multiheteroatom&#8208;doped PAH frameworks offers a promising design strategy for advancing PAH&#8208;based blue&#8208;light OLED applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Tetradentate PNNP&#8208;ligated Ir complexes serve as multifunctional catalysts for CO2 reduction, demonstrating exceptional efficiency across photochemical, thermal, and electrochemical systems. By tailoring ligand structures, these catalysts enable selective and durable CO2 conversion under light, heat, and electricity, providing a versatile and unified approach toward sustainable carbon utilization and energy&#8208;efficient fuel production.







Abstract
The efficient conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into valuable products remains a keystone of sustainable energy research. Achieving this goal requires catalytic methodologies that can adapt to diverse energy sources such as light, heat, or electricity. This concept highlights the remarkable versatility of tetradentate PNNP&#8208;ligated iridium complexes, (PNNP)Ir, as multifunctional catalysts, which demonstrate outstanding performance in CO2 reduction across photochemical, thermal, and electrochemical systems. By fine&#8208;tuning the ligand structure for each system, (PNNP)Ir complexes achieved remarkable efficiency, selectivity, and durability across all applications.

         <title>Diboron Reagents in N&#8722;N Bond Cleavage of Hydrazines, N&#8208;Nitrosamines, and Azides: Reactivity and Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 26, May 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis(neopentyl glycolato)diboron) (B2nep2) efficiently cleaves N&#8722;N bonds in hydrazines, N&#8208;nitrosamines and azides through alkoxide activation. This transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free and operationally simple protocol yields amines (or amides in the case of azides) in an environmentally friendly way. Both experimental and theoretical studies suggest a non&#8208;radical but concerted mechanism, involving simultaneous B&#8722;B and N&#8722;N bond cleavage.







Abstract
Diboron reagents are known for their ability to promote the deoxygenation of amine or pyridine oxides, nitroarenes, and nitrones through the formation of B&#8722;O&#8722;B bonds. In this study, we have investigated the potential of diboron reagents to induce N&#8722;N bond cleavage in hydrazines, N&#8208;nitrosamines and azides. Our findings show that the combination of B2nep2 as diboron source and KOMe as a Lewis base can effectively promote the N&#8722;N cleavage of a wide variety of substrates. For hydrazines and nitrosamines, the presence of an aryl group is essential for the reaction to proceed, probably due to a better stabilization of the negative charge developed during N&#8722;N bond cleavage. Both types of azides, aromatic and aliphatic, are easily reduced, and the resulting amines can be in&#8197;situ converted into the corresponding amides by simple treatment with a carboxylic acid. Experimental and theoretical calculations suggest a non&#8208;radical mechanism, with concerted B&#8722;B and N&#8722;N bond cleavage in the case of hydrazines and azides, and a stepwise mechanism in the case of N&#8208;nitrosamines, where deoxygenation occurs as the first step, involving the formation of an N&#8208;nitrene intermediate.

The effect of a pendant neutral alcohol moiety in the N&#8208;alkylated cyclam (1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclotetradecane) ligand backbone is examined for the non&#8208;heme mononuclear oxoiron(IV) unit in [FeIV(Osyn)(TMC&#8208;HOR)(NCCH3)]2+ (1&#8208;syn) (TMC&#8208;HOR=2&#8208;(4,8,11&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclotetradecan1&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;ol). Unlike in the related [FeIV(Oanti)(TMC&#8208;SR)]+ (3&#8208;anti) (TMC&#8208;SR=1&#8208;mercaptoethyl&#8208;4,8,11&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclotetradecane) complex, bearing an axial mono&#8208;anionic thiolate ligand trans to the oxo unit, the alcohol moiety in 1&#8208;syn stays protonated and does not axially coordinate to iron. The protonation of the alcohol moiety is a prerequisite for the stabilization of the oxoiron(IV) core; it presumably serves as a hydrogen bonding donor to the oxoiron(IV) unit, which is positioned syn to the three methyl groups. Comparative reactivity studies reveal 1&#8208;syn to be a stronger hydrogen atom abstraction but weaker oxygen atom transfer agent relative to the [FeIV(Osyn)(TMC)(NCCH3)]2+ (2&#8208;syn) complex, bearing the N&#8208;tetramethylated cyclam (TMC) ligand.

         <title>Chiral Zero&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Antimony Chloride with Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Solvent&#8208;Induced Property Regulation</title>

Two pairs of enantiomeric Sb3+&#8208;based 0D chiral hybrid metal halides, (R/S&#8208;3AP)4SbCl11&#8901;DMF and (R/S&#8208;3AP)4SbCl11&#8901;ACN, demonstrate efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), a maximum |glum| of 2.27&#215;10&#8722;3. Solvent molecules play a crucial role in modulating their structural and chiroptical properties. Their CPL&#8208;emitting devices and anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications highlight the potential of these materials for advanced chiral optoelectronic technologies.







Abstract
In this study, we synthesized two pairs of enantiomeric Sb3+&#8208;based 0D chiral hybrid metal halides (HMHs), (R/S&#8208;3AP)4SbCl11&#8901;DMF and (R/S&#8208;3AP)4SbCl11&#8901;ACN, which exhibit efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emissions with distinct optical properties influenced by the solvent environment. (R/S&#8208;3AP)4SbCl11&#8901;DMF displays bright orange luminescence with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 57.1&#8201;%, while (R/S&#8208;3AP)4SbCl11&#8901;ACN emits red luminescence with a PLQY of 17.4&#8201;%. Notably, (R/S&#8208;3AP)4SbCl11&#8901;ACN achieves a maximum dissymmetry factor (|glum|) of 2.27&#215;10&#8722;3, attributed to strong hydrogen bonding between organic and inorganic components. Reversible transformations between these two phases via solvent vapor stimulation enable dynamic photoluminescence (PL) switching, highlighting their application in anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology. Furthermore, circularly polarized light&#8208;emitting devices (CPL&#8208;emitting devices) based on these materials were fabricated, achieving a maximum |glum| of 2.01&#215;10&#8722;3. These findings underscore the potential of these chiral HMHs for advanced applications in chiral optoelectronics, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and CPL&#8208;emitting devices.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;bonding Assisted Quantum Yield Enhancement and Chromism Activity of 4&#8217;&#8208;Halo&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;azaboranils</title>

2&#8217;&#8208;azaboranils freezing the axial rotation reduce the nonradiative deactivation pathway to significantly improve the luminescence quantum yields over those for the parent boranils. In a network of &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, halogen&#8208;bonding, H&#8722;F hydrogen&#8208;bonding, and CH&#8208;&#960; interaction, 4&#8217;&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;azaboranil shows mechanochromism and vapochromism.







Abstract
By replacing a carbon atom of boranils with a nitrogen atom, azaboranils were newly designed. In the 2&#8217;&#8208;azaboranils synthesized from 2&#8208;aminopyridines with 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;naphthaldehyde, the pyridine ring underwent a hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction with the imine proton to restrain the molecular flexibility, which resulted in a significant improvement in luminescence quantum yield in both the solution state and the solid state over those for the parent boranils. The crystalline powder 4&#8217;&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;azaboranil exhibited mechanochromism and vapochromism in the network of &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, halogen&#8208;bonding, H&#8722;F hydrogen&#8208;bonding, and CH&#8208;&#960; interaction.

         <title>The Fluoride Ion Affinity Revisited: Do We Need the Anchor&#8208;Point Approach?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 26, May 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art benchmark of fluoride&#8208;ion affinities has been generated. Its application shows that widely used computational anchor&#8208;point methods based on isodesmic reactions rely on non&#8208;systematic error cancellations and are advantageous only when inappropriate density functionals and/or basis sets without diffuse functions are used. In all other cases direct FIA computations are accurate and preferable.







Abstract
A large and diverse high&#8208;level benchmark data set of computed gas&#8208;phase fluoride ion affinities (FIAs) for 71 small main&#8208;group Lewis acids is presented. It has been used to evaluate quantitatively DFT approaches with 52 functionals and 4 composite methods. Two widely used indirect anchor&#8208;point methods based on isodesmic reactions with fluorophosgene or the trimethyl silyl cation are compared to the direct computation of the FIA. It has been frequently stated that anchor&#8208;point methods are to be strongly preferred over direct FIA computations at DFT levels, as they avoid treatment of the naked fluoride ion. Here it is shown that this widespread assumption does not hold when modern functionals with low self&#8208;interaction errors and suitable basis sets with diffuse functions are used. In these cases, an anchor&#8208;point approach based on 

OCF2

 ${{\rm{OCF}}_2 }$



 has little or no advantage, and the widely used anchor&#8208;point calculations based on 

Me3Si+

 ${{\rm{Me}}_3 {\rm{Si}}^+ }$



 even deteriorate results in most cases. It is shown that this is due to a break&#8208;down of often prevailing error cancellations in the anchor&#8208;point approach that help to improve results when using less suitable functionals or basis sets. Overall, the direct computation of FIAs at appropriate DFT levels including diffuse basis functions is the clearly preferable route.

         <title>Noncovalent Interactions of Surface Adsorbed Species Control the Self&#8208;Assembly of Calcinated Nickel Oxide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 26, May 8, 2025. </description>

Different tendencies towards self&#8208;assembling in polar&#8208; and non&#8208;polar&#8208;faceted NiO nanoparticles (NPs) are explained using diffraction, imaging and 2D correlation spectroscopic techniques. NiO NPs with dominating (100) surface planes show pronounced self&#8208;assembling tendency due to favorable non&#8208;covalent interactions between non&#8208;dissociatively adsorbed water molecules, while those with dominating polar (111) surface planes behave oppositely, due to unfavorable interactions between surface hydroxyl groups.







Abstract
Utilizing state of the art diffraction, imaging and spectroscopic techniques in conjunction with two&#8208;dimensional correlation analysis, we provide novel in&#8208;depth insights into the physics and chemistry behind the different tendencies towards self&#8208;assembling in NiO nanoparticles as function of their surface facets. We demonstrate substantially different temperature dependence of the spectroscopic behavior of the two types of NiO NPs, polar versus non&#8208;polar faceted. Temperature&#8208;dependent spectroscopy data for NiO NPs obtained by the ammonia route are consistent with the process in which high amount of water molecules that take part in hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction with the surface&#8208;adsorbed non&#8208;dissociated water molecules on the neutral (100) planes are lost during the thermal treatment and attached back upon cooling. Interactions between water molecules adsorbed on two vicinal NiO NPs are responsible for keeping the self&#8208;assembly of the Ni(OH)2 NPs upon heat treatment. In carbamide&#8208;based NiO NPs, the self&#8208;assembly of initially formed Ni3(OH)4(NO3)2 NPs is not preserved. These NPs are terminated with polar (111) atomic planes, on which water molecules dissociatively adsorb, giving surface hydroxyl groups. As the hydrogen bonding proton &#8211; donating and accepting abilities are negligible at OH&#8208;polar terminated NiO NPs, only unfavorable inter&#8208;NP interactions are possible which leads to disruption of the NP assembly.

&lt;p&gt;Utilizing state of the art diffraction, imaging and spectroscopic techniques in conjunction with two-dimensional correlation analysis, we provide novel in-depth insights into the physics and chemistry behind the different tendencies towards self-assembling in NiO nanoparticles as function of their surface facets. We demonstrate substantially different temperature dependence of the spectroscopic behavior of the two types of NiO NPs, polar versus non-polar faceted. Temperature-dependent spectroscopy data for NiO NPs obtained by the ammonia route are consistent with the process in which high amount of water molecules that take part in hydrogen-bonding interaction with the surface-adsorbed non-dissociated water molecules on the neutral (100) planes are lost during the thermal treatment and attached back upon cooling.

         <title>Embedding High&#8208;Density Ionic Sites in Porous Aromatic Frameworks via Multivariate Strategy for ReO4&#8722; Capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 26, May 8, 2025. </description>

We proposed a rational method to link multiple building units using multivariate strategy and form PAFs with high density imidazolium groups. As expected, PAF&#8208;271with higher imidazolium density shows higher adsorption capacity for ReO4&#8722;.







Abstract
Rhenium is a rare and significant metal, making its recovery crucial for resource management. Herein, to address these issues, three porous aromatic frameworks with high&#8208;density ionic sites were successfully synthesized using a multivariate strategy. These MTV&#8208;iPAFs are named PAF&#8208;271, PAF&#8208;272 and PAF&#8208;273, respectively, and were employed for the ultrafast and selective removal of ReO4&#8722;. These materials exhibit varying high specific surface areas, porosities, and imidazolium densities. The results demonstrated that compared to PAF&#8208;272 with low adsorption site density and PAF&#8208;273 with high specific surface area, PAF&#8208;271 with higher imidazolium density exhibited superior performance for ReO4&#8722; adsorption. Specifically, PAF&#8208;271 could remove 98&#8201;% of ReO4&#8722; within 2&#8197;min, achieving a maximum adsorption capacity was 707&#8197;mg g&#8722;1. Moreover, PAF&#8208;271 also had excellent stability, making it highly effective for ReO4&#8722; adsorption under strong acid or alkali, radiation, high anion concentration and even in Hanford simulated waste liquid, it is expected to be applied to adsorb TcO4&#8722;. Embedding high&#8208;density ionic sites within PAFs by multivariate strategy result in highly stable and effective ReO4&#8722; disposal approach.

         <title>Intramolecular Electron Transfer in Unsymmetric Azohetero&#8208;aromatic Radical Bridged Diruthenium(III) Set Up</title>

Metal&#8208;ligand electronic synergy driven stabilization of MLCT excited state in unsymmetric azoheteroaromatic radical bridged diruthenium (III) complex 2 (S=1/2) incorporating electron rich acac (acetylacetonate) co&#8208;ligand has been demonstrated via synthetic architecture and structural/spectroscopic authentication.







Abstract
The article demonstrated the stabilization of MLCT excited state in structurally characterized unsymmetric N,N/N,O&#8722; donating azoheteroaromatic radical bridged (acac)2RuIII(&#956;&#8208;L3&#8226;&#8722;)RuIII(acac)2 (2, S=1/2) [L3= deprotonated 5&#8208;(diethylamino)&#8208;2&#8208;(6&#8208;methybenzo[d] thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)diazenylphenol, acac= electron rich acetylacetonate, N&#8722;N(azo) distance: 1.379(4) &#197;] via intramolecular electron transfer (IET) at the metal&#8208;azo interface. On the contrary, similar IET driven stabilization of MLCT excited state was failed to take place in N,N donating HL3 derived mononuclear counterpart (acac)2RuII(HL3) (1, S=0) with unperturbed azo function (N=N distance: 1.3361(18) &#197;) in spite of the fact of facile RuII/RuIII oxidation (0.28&#8197;V versus SCE) and azo reduction (&#8722;1.05&#8197;V versus SCE), presumably due to the influence of hydrogen bonding interaction at the back face of coordinated HL3. On the other hand, the use of electron poor bpy (2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine) as a co&#8208;ligand facilitated exclusive generation of the mononuclear [(bpy)2RuIIL3]ClO4 ([3]ClO4, S=0) encompassing N,O&#8722;&#8208;donating L3 with neutral azo group (N=N distance: 1.317(6) &#197;), unlike N,N donating HL3 in 1 due to the impact of &#963;&#8208;donating acac versus &#960;&#8208;accepting bpy, which also devoided of IET step. DFT calculations further suggested the origin of multiple redox steps and absorption profiles of 1, 2, 3+.

         <title>Syntheses of Structurally Complex Marine Cyclopropyl&#8208;Diterpenoids: Peyssonnoside A and Its Aglycon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 26, May 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This report provides a comprehensive account of the development of the first total synthesis of the marine natural product peyssonnoside A. After exploring several approaches that proved unsuccessful, a successful strategy was established, utilizing the Simmons&#8208;Smith reaction to construct the cyclopropane moiety at the core of the natural product.







Abstract
Peyssonnoside A is a marine&#8208;derived sulfated diterpenoid glucoside featuring a remarkable 5/6/3/6 tetracyclic skeleton with a highly substituted cyclopropane ring deeply embedded in its structure. Herein, we report on the full development of the first total synthesis of this natural product and its aglycon, peyssonnosol. Through the experimental evaluation of a series of synthetic strategies, including utilization of Ohloff&#8211;Rautenstrauch cycloisomerization and C&#8722;H allylation, we identified a concise, efficient, and highly diastereoselective route. Key steps in the synthesis of the aglycone peyssonnosol include a Simmons&#8211;Smith cyclopropanation and a Mukaiyama hydration, both guided by the inherent spatial features of the substrates. This optimized approach enabled the synthesis of peyssonnosol in 12 steps and 21&#8201;% overall yield and provides a robust framework for accessing structurally complex marine natural products.

A Zn(II)&#8208;stabilized radical&#8208;ligand enabled radical&#8208;type C(sp3)&#8208;H functionalization of N&#8208;benzylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;amines with terminal alkynes proceeding via tandem ligand&#8208;assisted HAT followed by radical addition of benzylic radical to alkyne forming vinyl radical intermediate, producing straightforward access to a wide variety of imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines in moderate to good yields is reported.







Abstract
A Zn(II)&#8208;stabilized radical&#8208;ligand enabled tandem cyclization via radical&#8208;type C(sp3)&#8208;H functionalization of N&#8208;benzylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;amines with terminal alkynes producing straightforward access to a wide variety of imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines in moderate to good yields is reported. In the presence of KOtBu the Zn(II)&#8208;catalyst [ZnIILaCl2] (1&#8201;a) (La=2&#8208;((4&#8208;chlorophenyl)diazenyl)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline) undergoes one&#8208;electron reduction to the active catalyst [ZnII(La)&#8226;&#8722;Cl2] [1&#8201;a]&#8722; bearing a ligand&#8208;centered radical. Upon coordination of N&#8208;benzylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;amine to [1&#8201;a]&#8722;, the radical&#8208;ligand abstracts a hydrogen atom from the benzylic position, forming a benzylic radical intermediate which, through radical addition with the alkyne generates a vinyl radical intermediate. Subsequent cyclization via intramolecular nucleophilic attack by the pyridine nitrogen produces imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines. Control experiments and spectroscopic investigation confirm the radical&#8208;ligand assisted tandem radical&#8208;type C(sp3)&#8208;H activation, addition, and cyclization steps.

         <title>Endowing Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons with Induced Supramolecular Chirality by Engineering Cation&#8208;&#960; Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 26, May 8, 2025. </description>

Chiral supramolecular cation&#8208;&#960; co&#8208;assembly were fabricated, primarily driven by cation&#8208;&#960; interaction between electron&#8208;poor chiral cationic polymer R/S&#8208;Pd and electron&#8208;rich polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PHAs). This cation&#8208;&#960; co&#8208;assembly can derive into 12 different PAHs and observed induced supramolecular chiral transfer in the PAHs observed both in DMSO solution and THF/H2O (v/v, 6/4) supramolecular gel matrices.







Abstract
The cation&#8208;&#960; interaction is a crucial noncovalent binding force prevalent in many biological and chemical systems, however, are rarely reported in chiral supramolecular systems. Here, a supramolecular chiral system is reported, wherein cation&#8208;&#960; interaction play significant roles. The interaction involves a chiral cationic palladium complex (R&#8208;Pd) co&#8208;assembling with 12 different polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), resulting in the formation of supramolecular gels in mixed solvents. This co&#8208;assembly induces supramolecular chirality in the PAHs, with cation&#8722;&#960; interaction identified as the primary driving force. The confirmation of this interaction is supported by high&#8208;resolution mass, 1H NMR, nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY), XRD and CD. Most importantly, with the synergy of hydrogen bonds, the cation&#8208;&#960; interaction can be stabilized in a mixed solvent containing water, leading the co&#8208;assembly to form supramolecular gel, as well as enhanced chiral induction of PAHs. This discovery serves as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle example showing how the weak cation&#8208;&#960; interaction could be a powerful guide in attaining induced chirality of PAHs.

         <title>Novel Base&#8208;Labile Linkers for Convenient Purification and Functional Group Introduction in Solid&#8208;Phase Glycan Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 26, May 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three novel base&#8208;labile linkers, synthesized through straightforward chemical methods, yield terminal amines, carboxylic acid groups, and free reducing ends after solid&#8208;phase glycan synthesis. The phthalate in resin 2 and resin 3 can be cleaved by methanolysis or hydrazinolysis. Using these linkers, nine tetrasaccharides and one octasaccharide were successfully synthesized.







Abstract
Glycans are essential biomolecules across species, but their structure&#8208;property relationships remain poorly understood. Pure oligosaccharide samples are crucial for studying these properties, and their preparation heavily relies on chemical synthesis. The linker used for attaching the oligosaccharide to the solid support is essential during solid&#8208;phase glycan synthesis. Here, we present three base&#8208;labile linkers compatible with Merrifield resin. The first type of resin, containing a hydroxyhexanoic acid linker, can be prepared in a one&#8208;step synthesis and releases glycans with a terminal carboxylic acid after methanolysis and hydrolysis. Linkers on the second and third types of resin can be synthesized through simple chemical reactions and cleaved to reveal either a free reducing end of the oligosaccharide or a terminal amine with a C5&#8208;spacer. The phthalate structure in the second and third types of resin is sensitive to sodium methoxide and can also be cleaved during hydrazinolysis. Hydrazinolysis, rather than methanolysis, enables the isolation of oligosaccharide with pivaloyl ester protection and facilitates the purification process compared to partially protected compounds. Using these resins, we prepared nine tetrasaccharides and one octasaccharide, including &#945; (1&#8208;6) mannan, &#945; (1&#8208;4) glucan, &#946; (1&#8208;4) glucan, and &#946; (1&#8208;3) glucan. Glycans with terminal functional groups can be converted into glycoconjugates for further applications.

         <title>Oxidation&#8208;Deformylation Cascade Catalyzed By a Mononuclear Copper Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 26, May 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired copper complex is able to catalyze two successive oxidative steps of alcohol conversion in the presence of hydrogen peroxide under mild conditions: (i) alcohol oxidation to aldehyde and (ii) aldehyde deformylation. Isotopic effects on the reaction rates indicate that hydrogen atom abstraction is rate limiting for both steps.







Abstract
In this study, two copper complexes were synthesized using N3 (arising from two pyridines and one amide group) containing ligands N&#8208;(2&#8208;picolyl)picolinamide (L1H) and bis(2&#8208;pyridylcarbonyl)amine (L2H), forming [(L1)CuII(OH2)(NO3)] (1) and [(L2)CuII(OH2)2](NO3) (2). The reaction of complex 1 with hydrogen peroxide in alcoholic solvents yielded a formate&#8208;bound complex. Studies with isotopically labeled 13C ethanol indicated that formate originates from the C1 of ethanol after C&#8722;C bond cleavage. Complex 1 was found to catalytically convert primary alcohols into formic acid probably following a two&#8208;step process: (i) alcohol oxidation to aldehyde and (ii) aldehyde deformylation. Further experiments with 2&#8208;phenylpropionaldehyde (2&#8208;PPA) confirm the ability of complex 1 to catalyze aldehyde deformylation. Both steps of the reaction are associated with significant kinetic deuterium isotope effects (KDIE), suggesting that hydrogen atom abstractions (HAA) occur during the rate&#8208;determining steps of both conversions. Overall, this system proposes a clean catalytic process for alcohol&#8208;to&#8208;formic acid conversion, operating under mild conditions, and offering potential synthetic applications.

Overall, this system proposes a clean catalytic process for alcohol-to-formic acid conversion, operating under mild conditions, and offering potential synthetic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A New Generation of Sumanene&#8208;Based AIEgens for the Effective Recognition of Metal Cations in Solutions Containing 95&#8197;vol&#8201;% of Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 26, May 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) active sumanene&#8208;based receptors were synthesized and successfully applied to the effective recognition of cesium or lithium cations in solutions containing 95&#8197;vol&#8201;% of water.







Abstract
In recent years, the application of sumanene derivatives for the optical detection of metal cations was demonstrated. Unfortunately, known sumanene&#8208;based receptors enable the detection process in purely organic solutions or in aqueous media containing not lower than 50&#8197;vol&#8201;% of organic solvent. Designing easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize sumanene&#8208;based optical receptors able to effectively recognize metal cations in aqueous solutions containing a slight volume fraction of organic solvent remained an important and vital challenge. In this work, we show that water&#8208;insoluble sumanene receptors composed of only carbon and hydrogen atoms enable the effective detection of cesium (Cs+) or lithium (Li+) cations in solutions containing 95&#8197;vol&#8201;% of water. Their key feature is related to the exhibition of an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effect. We discovered that the designed sumanene receptors exhibit excellent detection parameters expressed by Stern&#8208;Volmer constant values at the level from 108 to 1010&#8197;M&#8722;1. This work also shows that by simple modification of the sumanene receptor structure, it is possible to drastically change its detection preference from large Cs+ cations to small Li+ cations. The highest sensitivity of the designed receptors was concluded for Na+ or Li+, depending on the receptor structure. This work opens new avenues in designing sumanene&#8208;based optical receptors.

The darkness of the aqueous solution has been illuminated with a greenish glow and no cation is safe anymore. Like deep&#8208;sea fish, new AIE&#8208;active sumanene derivatives selectively track Li+ and Cs+ cations, and their water insolubility is no obstacle. Easy to synthesize and simple to apply, a new predator has entered the waters of supramolecular chemistry. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Kasprzak and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202500705).

         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature shows PNNP&#8211;iridium complex catalysts that can utilize light (orange), electrical (blue), and heat (red) energy; useful when globally or locally considering CO2 immobilization and energy supply. HCO2H, with minor amounts of CO, is produced when using light energy with the C&lt;C&#8208;&gt;H bond as the electron/hydrogen source; similarly, HCO2H predominates in the reaction of CO2 with H2O using electric energy. CH3OH is formed by thermal hydrogenation of CO2. More information can be found in the Concept by J. Jung and S. Saito (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202500328).

A commercially available sulfonyl&#8208;containing solid support, which is first converted into a mixed N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide carbonate, enabled robust conjugation with primary and secondary amines. Oligonucleotides were prepared by using standard methods, with little to no modification. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202500448), D.&#160;K. O'Flaherty and co&#8208;workers explain how, building on this framework, they introduced a novel amino&#8208;containing tandem oligonucleotide synthesis (aTOS) methodology that facilitates the introduction of multiple terminal amino (or monophosphate) groups across two oligonucleotide strands.

Imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines act as the core unit for many commercially available drugs. Tandem cyclization between N&#8208;benzylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;amines and terminal alkynes produces imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines when using a well&#8208;defined ZnII catalyst. Here, the girl and the boy represent the metal and the ligand centre, respectively. They work cooperatively to prepare delicious food symbolizing imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines. This depicts how metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity has a key role in this transformation, where all the redox events occur from the ligand, and the metal acts as a template.

         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom catalysts are vital for the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides due to their&#160;Lewis acidic sites. This concept provides a concise perspective on the advancements of single&#8208;atom catalysts for CO2 cycloaddition reactions, focusing on the mechanism and catalytic driven forces. Moreover, we examine prospective advancements in the sustainable production of cyclic carbonates through CO2 cycloaddition.








Abstract
The conversion of CO2 and epoxides into cyclic carbonates represents a promising strategy for CO2 utilization and valorization, with applications spanning pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, polymer manufacturing, and energy storage. This concept article provides a concise perspective on the advancements in CO2 cycloaddition reactions catalyzed by single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), encompassing photocatalysis, thermocatalysis, and photothermal catalysis. Despite significant progress in the field, challenges such as limited catalytic activity and low stability of SACs under reaction conditions remain significant obstacles to industrial implementation. Mechanistic insights into active species are emphasized to enable the rational design and optimization of catalytic systems. In addition, key industrial challenges, such as the elimination of co&#8208;catalysts, scalability limitations, and the development of cost&#8208;effective production methods, are critically examined. By bridging fundamental research and practical applications, this concept article seeks to guide future advancements in the sustainable production of cyclic carbonates through CO2 cycloaddition.

         <title>Signal Enhancement of Luminol&#8208;Based Electrochemiluminescence Systems and Their Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 26, May 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes four typical luminol ECL signal amplification strategies, such as self&#8208;enhancement strategy, development of novel co&#8208;reactants, co&#8208;reaction accelerators, and resonance energy transfer, and analyses their roles in improving the effectiveness of luminol ECL signals. In addition, the applications of luminol ECL in the fields of sensing, imaging analysis and materials characterization are discussed.








Abstract
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) has emerged as a powerful analytical tool owing to its low background, high sensitivity, and wide dynamic range. Luminol, a commonly used ECL emitter, is widely applied in ECL&#8208;based analysis due to its low triggering potential, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and low toxicity. Despite the significant advantages of the luminol ECL system, its relatively low luminescence efficiency limits its application in high&#8208;sensitivity detection. As a result, numerous strategies have been proposed to enhance the luminol ECL signal intensity. This review summarizes four typical ECL signal amplification strategies and analyzes their roles in improving the effectiveness of luminol&#8208;based ECL signals. Furthermore, the applications of luminol ECL in fields such as sensing, imaging analysis, and material characterization are discussed. Finally, the future research directions and potential applications of the luminol ECL system are highlighted.

         <title>Abundant Transition Metal Based Photocatalysts for Red Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 26, May 8, 2025. </description>

We discussed here the recent developments on the abundant transition metal based photocatalysts and their applications in red light&#8208;driven photocatalysis.








Abstract
Photocatalysis emerges as an efficient and versatile tool for the preparation of organic compounds via the development of new methodologies and new photosensitizers. Mostly UV and blue light irradiation are used for such reactions. Red light is low&#8208;energy light, it is less harmful and has more penetration depth. Hence red light&#8208;driven photocatalysis would be more suitable for preparing value&#8208;added products. Red&#8208;absorbing photosensitizers are mostly based on rare and expensive metals. In this review, we describe the recent developments on Earth&#8208;abundant transition metal&#8208;based photosensitizers (W(0), Mo(0), Cr(0), Fe(III), Cu(I), Zn(II)) and their applications in red light&#8208;driven photocatalysis. Photocatalysis using both electron transfer and energy transfer processes is discussed. Three different red light&#8208;induced reactions such as direct monophotonic excitation, sensitized triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (sTTA&#8208;UC), and dual red light photocatalysis are presented. Various organic transformations such as reductive dehalogenation and detosylation, reduction of diazonium salts, C&#9472;C coupling via C&#9472;H activation, oxidation of aryl boronic acids to phenols, polymerization reactions, cross dehydrogenative couplings, &#945;&#8208;cyanation of tertiary amines, Barton decarboxylation have been carried out using abundant photosensitizers and red light.

         <title>Structural Insights Into Amyloid Polymorphism: The Impact of Glutamine to Norleucine Substitutions in GNNQQNY Aggregation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 26, May 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the wild&#8208;type GNNQQNY, self&#8208;assembly is extremely fast and many intermediate structures are masked. By studying the selectively disrupted hydrogen&#8208;bonding variants, the data show that GNNQNleNY stabilizes at the protofibril stage, GNNQQNY progresses to achiral nanocrystals and GNNNleQNY evolves to twisted chiral fibers. By mapping the key forces driving amyloid stability and polymorphism, the results pave the way for future applications in biotechnology, nanomedicine, and amyloid&#8208;based therapeutics.








Abstract
Polypeptides can self&#8208;assemble into highly organized amyloid structures through complex and poorly understood mechanisms. To better understand the key parameters governing amyloidogenesis, we investigated the aggregation of the Sup35 prion&#8208;derived GNNQQNY sequence alongside two rationally designed mutants, glutamine to norleucine in the 4th or 5th position, where selective removal of hydrogen bonding capacity reduces amyloid structural stability. Our findings reveal that &#946;&#8208;sheet arrays form rapidly as an initial step, followed by &#960;&#8211;&#960; aromatic interactions between Tyr residues, which drive hierarchical self&#8208;assembly into 3D fibrillar structures via hydrophobic zippers and partial water exclusion. As the oligomers grow, they also acquire twist and chirality at the protofilament level, with Tyr ladders serving as key interaction surfaces that dictate the final amyloid architecture. These ladders guide protofibrils to assemble into either oppositely twisted chiral fibers or achiral nanocrystals, contributing to amyloid polymorphism. The emergence of distinct polymorphs is influenced by multiple factors, including fibril twisting, side&#8208;chain interactions, solvent exclusion, and local microenvironmental conditions. Our study provides crucial insights into the hierarchical nature of amyloid self&#8208;assembly and highlights the structural adaptability of amyloid fibrils, which is essential for designing functional amyloids and understanding the pathogenicity of disease&#8208;associated aggregates.

         <title>Halogen Bond&#8208;Driven Ligand Displacement: Co&#8208;Crystal Lattice Versus Coordination Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 26, May 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong halogen bond donor (1,4&#8208;diiodotetrafluorobenzene) can induce the amine ligand displacement in Jahn&#8211;Teller affected Cu(acac)2(amine) and in trans influenced VO(acac)2(amine) complexes, resulting the formation of respective co&#8208;crystals: M(acac)2&#183;1,4&#8208;DITFB and (amine)&#183;1,4&#8208;DITFB. The driving force behind this unprecedented cleavage of the metal&#8208;nitrogen coordination bond is the halogen bond stabilized co&#8208;crystal lattice






.

Abstract
Coordination bonds are generally stronger than halogen bonds; however, the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect in d&#8313; Cu(II) and the trans influence of the oxo&#8208;ligand in vanadyl (V&#9552;O) acetylacetonates can weaken N&#8594;Cu/V bonds, bringing them closer to the upper range of halogen bond strength. The study investigates the interactions between transition metal acetylacetonate complexes, M(acac)2(L) (M&#9472;Cu(II), V(IV) = O; L&#160;=&#160;amine ligands), and halogen bond (XB)&#8208;donor co&#8208;formers, particularly 1,4&#8208;diiodotetrafluorobenzene (1,4&#8208;DITFB). The co&#8208;crystallization experiments reveal an unusual ligand displacement phenomenon wherein the expected M(acac)2(L)&#183;1,4&#8208;DITFB complexes fail to form, instead yielding separate M(acac)2&#183;1,4&#8208;DITFB and L&#183;1,4&#8208;DITFB co&#8208;crystals. Computational studies reveal that while XB interactions alone may be insufficient to disrupt the M&#9472;N coordination bond, they can induce ligand displacement when amplified by the lattice stabilization of the resulting halogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;crystals, particularly in Jahn&#8211;Teller distorted d&#8313; Cu(II) and trans&#8208;influenced V(IV) = O complexes interacting with halogen bond donors.

     alt="Halogen Bond-Driven Ligand Displacement: Co-Crystal Lattice Versus Coordination Bonds"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong halogen bond donor (1,4-diiodotetrafluorobenzene) can induce the amine ligand displacement in Jahn&#8211;Teller affected Cu(acac)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(amine) and in trans influenced VO(acac)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(amine) complexes, resulting the formation of respective co-crystals: M(acac)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;1,4-DITFB and (amine)&#183;1,4-DITFB. The driving force behind this unprecedented cleavage of the metal-nitrogen coordination bond is the halogen bond stabilized co-crystal lattice

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coordination bonds are generally stronger than halogen bonds; however, the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect in d&#8313; Cu(II) and the trans influence of the oxo-ligand in vanadyl (V&#9552;O) acetylacetonates can weaken N&#8594;Cu/V bonds, bringing them closer to the upper range of halogen bond strength. The study investigates the interactions between transition metal acetylacetonate complexes, M(acac)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(L) (M&#9472;Cu(II), V(IV) = O; L&#160;=&#160;amine ligands), and halogen bond (XB)-donor co-formers, particularly 1,4-diiodotetrafluorobenzene (1,4-DITFB). The co-crystallization experiments reveal an unusual ligand displacement phenomenon wherein the expected M(acac)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(L)&#183;1,4-DITFB complexes fail to form, instead yielding separate M(acac)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;1,4-DITFB and L&#183;1,4-DITFB co-crystals. Computational studies reveal that while XB interactions alone may be insufficient to disrupt the M&#9472;N coordination bond, they can induce ligand displacement when amplified by the lattice stabilization of the resulting halogen-bonded co-crystals, particularly in Jahn&#8211;Teller distorted d&#8313; Cu(II) and trans-influenced V(IV) = O complexes interacting with halogen bond donors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploring Tyramine's Role in the Formation of Supramolecular Adducts with Nonsteroidal Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Drugs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 26, May 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An a priori design approach identified tyramine as an ideal co&#8208;former for obtaining new supramolecular adducts with nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs, speeding up the co&#8208;crystallization process. Three novel adducts and a new polymorphic form were synthesized and thoroughly characterized by solid&#8208;state NMR and single&#8208;crystal XRD. The resulting adducts showed an improved equilibrium aqueous solubility.








Abstract
In pharmaceutical crystal engineering, salification and co&#8208;crystallization are well&#8208;established strategies to enhance the physicochemical properties of nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which typically exhibit low aqueous solubility. This study introduces three new multicomponent crystalline systems of NSAIDs (S&#8208;naproxen, flurbiprofen, and ketoprofen) with the co&#8208;former tyramine, designed using knowledge&#8208;based methods. Additionally, a new polymorph of the diflunisal&#8211;tyramine system, synthesized via mechanochemical techniques, is reported. The new multicomponent systems were thoroughly characterized using solid&#8208;state NMR and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Aqueous solubility tests conducted through solution 1H NMR experiments revealed increased equilibrium solubility for all samples, highlighting the efficacy of crystal engineering in modulating the physicochemical properties of drugs.

         <title>Modulation of Optical and Electrochemical Properties of Cu(I) Alkynyl Clusters by Carboxylic Acid Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 26, May 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inclusion of carboxylic acid ligands significantly impacts the structural arrangement of the metal core in Cu(I) alkynyl clusters, thereby affecting their fluorescence properties. Furthermore, the incorporation of ferrocene into these clusters has been noted to induce modifications in the electrochemical performance of the Cu(I) alkynyl clusters.








Abstract
Surface ligands play a pivotal role in the functional design of atomically precise Cu(I) nanoclusters. They act as protective agents, ensuring the stability of the Cu(I) clusters, while also influencing their structure and properties. This study delves into the synthesis, structure, and properties of innovative Cu(I) nanoclusters co&#8208;stabilized by carboxylic acid and alkynyl ligands. The findings reveal that these surface ligands wield a significant impact on the cluster's structure and can even modulate the luminescent characteristics of the Cu(I) alkynyl clusters. Moreover, density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations shed light on how different carboxylic acid ligands affect the UV&#8208;visible absorptivity of paired Cu(I) clusters. In addition, ferrocene carboxylic acids were employed as protective ligands to impart electrochemical properties to the Cu(I) clusters. This research presents an effective methodology for synthesizing atomically precise Cu(I) clusters shielded by carboxylic acid ligands.

         <title>Integration of Ultrasmall Pt Clusters With Silanol Groups in Pure Silica Zeolites for Robust Formaldehyde Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 26, May 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafine Pt nanoclusters encapsulated within silicalite&#8208;1 zeolite were synthesized for formaldehyde oxidation at room temperature. The synergistic effect of Pt and adjacent silanol nests plays a key role in enhancing catalytic activity. The catalyst achieves complete formaldehyde removal even at 0.1 wt% Pt loading, with exceptional stability and water resistance, making it a promising solution for indoor air purification.








Abstract
Formaldehyde (HCHO) is a major indoor air pollutant that poses serious health risks. Catalytic oxidation of HCHO to CO2 and H2O at room temperature offers an efficient solution. Supported Pt nanoparticles are the most efficient catalysts, but challenges such as high cost and water resistant, limit their widespread application. Herein, we employ a ligand&#8208;protected direct hydrogen reduction strategy to encapsulate ultrafine Pt clusters within hydrophobic silicalite&#8208;1 zeolite. Cs&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, x&#8208;ray absorption, and solid nuclear magnetic resonance measurements confirmed that the Pt clusters are stabilized within zeolite channels by adjacent silanol groups. The optimized Pt@S&#8208;1&#8208;400H catalyst achieved complete HCHO removal at room temperature, with even low Pt loading of 0.1 wt%, affording a high specific activity of 171.9 molHCHO&#183;molPt&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1, representing the top level among all state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt&#8208;based catalysts. Significantly, the hydrophobic nature of silicalite&#8208;1 ensures excellent water resistance and long&#8208;term stability for the Pt@S&#8208;1&#8208;400H catalyst. In situ infrared spectroscopy reveals that silanol sites facilitate HCHO adsorption and the formation of formate intermediates. The synergistic effect between Pt clusters and adjacent silanol sites enhances the HCHO oxidation performance. The simple and cost&#8208;effective approach, combined with its excellent activity and stability, holds significant potential for effectively eliminating indoor pollutants in practical applications.

         <title>A Robust Strategy for Introducing Amino&#8208;Modifiers in Nucleic Acids: Enabling Novel Amino Tandem Oligonucleotide Synthesis in DNA and RNA</title>

We report a simple, efficient, and cost&#8208;effective methodology for introducing amino&#8208;modifiers into DNA and RNA using a commercially available solid support. By incorporating a base&#8208;labile sulfonyl linker within the strand, we developed an amino&#8208;containing tandem oligonucleotide synthesis (aTOS) methodology, which enables the introduction of multiple terminal amino (or monophosphate) groups across two oligonucleotide strands. Our approach provides a straightforward and robust strategy for incorporating amino modifiers in oligonucleotides.








Abstract
Amino&#8208;modifiers are pivotal chemical modifications in nucleic acid scaffolds, serving applications ranging from (bio)conjugation to probing the origins of life. We report a simple, efficient, and cost&#8208;effective methodology for the introduction of amino&#8208;modifiers into DNA and RNA. This approach leverages a commercially available sulfonyl&#8208;containing solid support, which is first converted into a mixed N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide carbonate, enabling robust conjugation with primary and secondary amines whether nucleosidic or non&#8208;nucleosidic. Oligonucleotides are synthesized via solid&#8208;phase synthesis and purified using standard methods, with little to no modification. Building on this framework, we introduce a novel amino&#8208;containing tandem oligonucleotide synthesis (aTOS) methodology, which facilitates the introduction of multiple terminal amino (or monophosphate) groups across two oligonucleotide strands. This innovative method broadens the toolkit for the introduction of amino modifications in nucleic acids, for applications in nucleic acid (bio)chemistry and biotechnology.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Deficient Transition Metal Oxynitrides as Anode Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 26, May 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized two new oxynitride compounds Ca4La8V4O8N12 and Sr3La9V4O7N13. The anionic vacancy is more easily formed in the Sr3La9V4O7N13 structure, the influence of the defect level on the energy band is stronger, facilitating electron transition in the structure and enhancing electrical conductivity. This study is of great significance to broaden the wide application of transition metal oxynitrides in the field of electronics.








Abstract
Transition metal oxynitrides, with their unique electronic structures and excellent conductivity, hold significant promise as anode materials in fuel cells. In this study, we synthesized and characterized two novel anion&#8208;deficient transition metal oxynitrides: Ca4La8V4O8N12 and Sr3La9V4O7N13. Their crystal structures were determined via Rietveld refinement of X&#8208;ray and neutron diffraction data, revealing a higher concentration of anion vacancies in Sr3La9V4O7N13. As a result, Sr3La9V4O7N13 exhibits significantly enhanced electrical conductivity compared to Ca4La8V4O8N12. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that Sr3La9V4O7N13 possesses higher defect formation energies, influencing its band structure and facilitating electron transitions, thereby enhancing conductivity. This study underscores the role of anion deficiencies in modulating the electronic properties of transition metal oxynitrides and offers new insights for designing high&#8208;performance anode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).

         <title>Excited State Dual Proton Transfer on a &#946;&#8208;Carboline Fluorophore and Its Variable Response to Water and D2O</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 26, May 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes non&#8208;cascaded excited&#8208;state intramolecular double proton transfer (ESIDPT) in &#946;&#8208;carboline system TrySPy. The experimental and computational investigation suggests that the ESIDPT mechanism involves stepwise proton transfer. The first ESIPT occurs fast and forms the N&#8208;ZPT* form, emitting at &#8764;520&#160;nm. The second ESIPT forms T&#8208;ZPT* and emits &#8764;680&#160;nm. TrySPy can differentiate between water and D2O.








Abstract
The excited state proton transfer (ESPT), a fundamental reaction in chemical and biological systems, is known for its diverse applications. Recent developments in these reactions have examined excited&#8208;state multiple proton transfer (ESMPT) involving two or more protons via inter&#8208;/intra&#8208;molecular mode. This work reports the proton transfer ability of a &#946;&#8208;carboline probe, TrySPy, bearing dual intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The molecule was designed as a hybrid of known fluorophores, TryPy and TrySy, and can be synthesized in one step. Preliminary studies revealed a rigid structure of the compound with increased hydrogen bonding and high relative photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY &#8764; 99). The probe works effectively in the cellular environment and can differentiate between water and D2O by slowing down the proton transfer (PT) process. In water, the fast PT does not allow emission from the enol form (N&#8208;N*), and the emission is observed at 520&#160;nm due to its N&#8208;ZPT* form. However, in D2O, replacing the OH group with OD promotes aggregation of the enol form, with emission at &#8764;450&#160;nm. The mechanistic model proposed for this work relies on the non&#8208;cascaded excited&#8208;state intramolecular double proton transfer (ESIDPT) mechanism. This study expands the scope of the ESIDPT systems in the domain of biologically important fused heterocyclic systems.

         <title>The Role of Lithium Ions on the Solubility of K4E4 in Ethylenediamine and the Oxidation of the Zintl Anions [E4]4&#8722; (E = Ge, Sn, Pb) as well as [Ge9]4&#8722;</title>

         <dc:description>
The solubility of K4Ge4, K4Sn4, and K4Pb4 phases and oxidation of comprised four&#8208;atom clusters in ethylenediamine (en) is induced by the addition of LiCl. The 119Sn NMR spectra of [Sn9]4&#8722; with Li+ and K+ counterions indicate a cation&#8208;dependent change in both the chemical shift and coupling constant, strongly suggesting K+/[Sn9]4&#8722; ion pairing, which is not observed for Li+ counterions.








Abstract
Zintl phases are excellent precursors for nine atom [E9]4&#8722; clusters, which are readily accessible by dissolution of A4E9 phases (A = Na&#8211;Rb; E = Ge&#8211;Pb) in ethylenediamine (en). In contrast, the binary alkali&#8208;metal tetrel phases of composition A4E4 are insoluble in en. Furthermore, Li+&#160;cations are rarely investigated as counterions for tetrel element Zintl clusters. We report here that K4E4, comprising [E4]4&#8722; polyanions (E = Ge, Sn, and Pb), which are insoluble in en, readily dissolves in en in the presence of lithium ions and the four atomic polyanions [E4]4&#8722; are oxidized to nine&#8208;atom [E9]4&#8722; clusters during dissolution. We isolated crystals of [Li(en)2.5]4[Ge9] and [Li(en)2]4[E9] (E = Sn and Pb) with exclusively Li counterions. Furthermore, the alkali&#8208;metal ion exchange of K4Ge9 with LiCl in en results also in the oxidation of [Ge9]4&#8722; to [Ge9&#8208;Ge9]6&#8722; dimers which were isolated as partially and fully ion&#8208;exchanged salts such as K2[Li(en)2]4[Ge9&#8208;Ge9] and [Li(en)2]6.5[Ge9&#8208;Ge9], respectively. NMR spectroscopic investigations of solutions of [Sn9]4&#8722; that contain variable Li:K ratio reveal contact K+/[Sn9]4&#8208; ion pairs, while Li+ ions form solvent&#8208;separated ion pairs. The role of Li+ ions on the solubility of Zintl phases and Li+&#160;assisted oxidation of Zintl ions is highlighted.

Aligned ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets anchored on a carbon framework (i.e., CF@MoS2) through a C&#9472;S bond via a sacrificial template strategy using Te nanowires are developed for both LIBs and SIBs. The C&#9472;S interfacial bonding ensures robust structural integration, while expanded interlayer spacing and bimodal pore channels synergistically enhance ion/electron transport. As a result, the optimized CF@MoS2 exhibits excellent rate capability and record&#8208;breaking cycling stability in both half&#8208;cell and full&#8208;cell.








Abstract
Molybdenum disulfide (i.e., MoS2), while promising as an anode for alkali&#8208;ion batteries, faces critical challenges including structural degradation and sluggish ion diffusion kinetics in practical applications. Herein, MoS2 nanosheets anchored on a carbon framework (i.e., CF@MoS2) through C&#9472;S bonds were successfully synthesized, in which the three&#8208;dimensional carbon framework was synthesized using tellurium nanowires as the template. The C&#9472;S interfacial bonding ensures robust structural integration, while expanded interlayer spacing and bimodal pore channels synergistically enhance ion/electron transport. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared CF@MoS2 demonstrates unprecedented performance in both lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). A high lithium storage capacity of 1072 mAh g&#8722;1 with superior stability over 500 cycles at 1.0 A g&#8722;1 can be achieved, while a high&#8208;rate capacity of 570 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5.0 A g&#8722;1 and excellent cycling stability over 500 cycles are also demonstrated in SIBs. The great features of CF@MoS2 are further confirmed versus LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode in a high&#8208;voltage and fast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion full battery, where the excellent stability and long lifespan are both confirmed. This work probes a great potential for developing metal sulfide&#8208;based electrodes in next&#8208;generation fast&#8208;charging energy storage systems.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Total Synthesis of Lansai B</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 26, May 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lansai B was obtained in a chemoenzymatic approach from the small building block 5&#8208;bromoindole utilizing two enzymes. Applying a tryptophan synthase and a further characterized C3&#8208;methyltransferase the sterically demanding framework is constructed within just six steps. After late&#8208;stage Suzuki&#8208;coupling and n&#8208;methylation the natural product was isolated.








Abstract
Lansai B is an indole alkaloid whose biosynthesis is not yet elucidated. However, utilizing nature's tools enabled the stereoselective formation of this unique framework, first by providing the substituted tryptophan as starting material and later in the scaffold&#8208;building step forming the pyrroloindole motif. For the latter, the C3&#8208;methyltransferase from Streptomyces griseoviridis (SgMT) is employed for the diastereoselective methylation. Investigating the scope of the enzyme proved that introducing a bromide in the 5&#8208;position was ideal for the synthetic endeavor. With this, the stage was set for the synthesis of lansai&#160;B, introducing the prenyl group late via a Suzuki coupling.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence From Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in a Bimetallic Eu&#8211;Al Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 26, May 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Following spontaneous symmetry breaking, a Eu&#8211;Al complex containing only achiral ligands, forms a non&#8208;racemic conglomerate. Both single crystals and the whole crystallized material are circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence active, despite the absence of any chiral inducer.








Abstract
The emergence of optically active functional compounds through spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is a rare but intriguing phenomenon with relevance of both practical and fundamental interest. Here we show that a racemic Eu&#8211;Al compound, bearing only non&#8208;chiral ligands, forms a conglomerate upon crystallization. Single crystals of the compound are electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) active. Moreover, we found that a significant enantiomeric excess (50%) of either enantiomer is present in each crystallization batch (non&#8208;racemic conglomerate). Such spontaneous symmetry breaking leads not only to optically active single enantiomorph crystals but to an overall solid bulk with significant ECD and CPL.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Inversion of Phosphorescence and Fluorescence Emission Triggered in Twisted Dimeric Structures Displaying Excitonic Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 26, May 8, 2025. </description>

The investigation of intramolecular excitonic coupling in dimeric luminescent structures revealed an inversion of phosphorescence and fluorescence emission in semi&#8208;rigid matrices for the compound with strong charge&#8208;transfer character.








Abstract
We here report the design of new thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters based on a dimeric binaphthalimide structure, which induces a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap. The impact of dimerization and the resulting intramolecular exciton effect are highlighted through comparisons with monomeric variants. Additionally, we studied the influence of the acceptor strength, alongside global electronic effects&#8212;such as exciton coupling and charge resonance&#8212;induced by the donor/acceptor/acceptor/donor (DAAD) configurations. These effects led to the energetic merging, and even inversion, of the phosphorescence and fluorescence spectra in semi&#8208;rigid matrices, including room&#8208;temperature polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) thin films, compromising the TADF response initially enhanced in fluidic environments.

Self&#8208;assembly of PTFEP55&#8208;b&#8208;PS50 in THF yields diverse nanomorphologies (spheres, bicontinuous, toroids, cylinders, vesicles) by varying concentration. PTFEP crystallinity increases with concentration, driving morphological transitions. Unique intermediates (&#8220;flower&#8208;like,&#8221; LCMs, &#8220;octopi&#8208;like&#8221;) reveal transformation mechanisms, showcasing unprecedented structural diversity and control.








Abstract
In this study, we demonstrate that varying the initial concentration of the poly&#8208;[bis(trifluoroethoxy)phosphazene]&#8208;b&#8208;poly(styrene) (PTFEP55&#8208;b&#8208;PS50) block copolymer enables the formation of diverse, well&#8208;defined nanomorphologies through self&#8208;assembly in tetrahydrofuran (THF). By adjusting the copolymer concentration, spherical micelles (0.1&#160;mg/mL), bicontinuous micelles (0.33&#160;mg/mL), toroidal micelles (2.0&#160;mg/mL), cylindrical micelles (10&#160;mg/mL), and vesicles (50&#160;mg/mL) were successfully prepared. This simple methodology, using a single solvent and no additives, allowed for the investigation of morphological transformation mechanisms. Intermediate structures, such as &#8220;flower&#8208;like&#8221; morphologies (0.66&#160;mg/mL), large compound micelles (LCMs, 1.0&#160;mg/mL), and perforated micelles (1.5&#160;mg/mL), were identified, revealing transitions between bicontinuous and toroidal morphologies. In situ studies captured the opening of toroidal structures into cylindrical micelles, while &#8220;octopi&#8208;like&#8221; structures were observed at intermediate concentrations between cylindrical and vesicular architectures. Wide&#8208;angle x&#8208;ray diffraction (WAXD) analysis showed that PTFEP blocks in the nanostructure cores are amorphous at low concentrations (&lt;&#160;2&#160;mg/mL) but exhibit increasing crystallinity at higher concentrations (&gt;&#160;2&#160;mg/mL), transitioning from toroidal to cylindrical and vesicular morphologies. This work highlights the ability to control the self&#8208;assembly of PTFEP&#8208;b&#8208;PS, generating a wide range of nanomorphologies by modulating PTFEP crystallinity through concentration adjustments. The unprecedented structural diversity of this system underscores its potential for designing advanced nanostructured materials.

&lt;p&gt;Self-assembly of PTFEP&lt;sub&gt;55&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-PS&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; in THF yields diverse nanomorphologies (spheres, bicontinuous, toroids, cylinders, vesicles) by varying concentration. PTFEP crystallinity increases with concentration, driving morphological transitions. Unique intermediates (&#8220;&lt;i&gt;flower-like&lt;/i&gt;,&#8221; LCMs, &#8220;&lt;i&gt;octopi-like&lt;/i&gt;&#8221;) reveal transformation mechanisms, showcasing unprecedented structural diversity and control.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we demonstrate that varying the initial concentration of the poly-[bis(trifluoroethoxy)phosphazene]-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-poly(styrene) (PTFEP&lt;sub&gt;55&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-PS&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) block copolymer enables the formation of diverse, well-defined nanomorphologies through self-assembly in tetrahydrofuran (THF). By adjusting the copolymer concentration, spherical micelles (0.1&#160;mg/mL), bicontinuous micelles (0.33&#160;mg/mL), toroidal micelles (2.0&#160;mg/mL), cylindrical micelles (10&#160;mg/mL), and vesicles (50&#160;mg/mL) were successfully prepared. This simple methodology, using a single solvent and no additives, allowed for the investigation of morphological transformation mechanisms. Intermediate structures, such as &#8220;&lt;i&gt;flower-like&lt;/i&gt;&#8221; morphologies (0.66&#160;mg/mL), large compound micelles (LCMs, 1.0&#160;mg/mL), and perforated micelles (1.5&#160;mg/mL), were identified, revealing transitions between bicontinuous and toroidal morphologies. In situ studies captured the opening of toroidal structures into cylindrical micelles, while &#8220;&lt;i&gt;octopi-like&lt;/i&gt;&#8221; structures were observed at intermediate concentrations between cylindrical and vesicular architectures. Wide-angle x-ray diffraction (WAXD) analysis showed that PTFEP blocks in the nanostructure cores are amorphous at low concentrations (&amp;lt;&#160;2&#160;mg/mL) but exhibit increasing crystallinity at higher concentrations (&amp;gt;&#160;2&#160;mg/mL), transitioning from toroidal to cylindrical and vesicular morphologies. This work highlights the ability to control the self-assembly of PTFEP-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-PS, generating a wide range of nanomorphologies by modulating PTFEP crystallinity through concentration adjustments. The unprecedented structural diversity of this system underscores its potential for designing advanced nanostructured materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Rectangles Featuring Two Parallel NCN&#8208;Coordinated Platinum Units: Enhancing Near&#8208;Infrared Emission Through Excimer Formation</title>

Macro&#8208;cycling into the near&#8208;infrared: By incorporating two cyclometallated Pt(II) units into opposite sides of a molecular rectangle, the formation of near&#8208;infrared&#8208;emitting excited states that span the two units is promoted in solution, compared to the corresponding, acyclic, tweezer&#8208;like complexes. A degree of molecular reorganization is nevertheless required to form such states, which is inhibited in more rigid media.








Abstract
New macrocyclic molecules are described that incorporate Pt(NCN) units on opposite edges of a rectangular structure, with xanthene units constituting the other two sides. Here, NCN represents a cyclometallating tridentate ligand based on 2,6&#8208;di(2&#8208;pyridyl)benzene or its pyrimidine analog. The complexes display strong photoluminescence peaking in the near&#8208;infrared region of the spectrum in solution (&#955;max up to 761&#160;nm). Photophysical data and DFT calculations indicate that the emission arises from &#8220;intramolecular excimers&#8221;&#8212;triplet excited states that form when the two Pt(NCN) units within the molecule are brought into close proximity to interact interfacially. In doped polymers, the necessary molecular distortion is inhibited, but related excited states that emit in a similar region can still form through intermolecular interactions.

         <title>A Highly Chemically Robust 2D Zn&#8208;MOF as Promising Adsorbent for One&#8208;Step Methane Purification From Multicomponent Gas Mixtures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 26, May 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemically robust and easily scalable 2D Zn&#8208;MOF (IITKGP&#8208;27) was strategically designed and developed for one&#8208;step methane purification from multicomponent mixtures of light C2&#8208;hydrocarbons and CO2 gases with a nice trade&#8208;off between high sorption capacities, moderate selectivity and low regeneration cost even at ambient conditions benefiting from its microporous structure with abundant uncoordinated interaction sites.








Abstract
One&#8208;step CH4 purification from C2&#8208;hydrocarbons and CO2 gas impurities is essential in the quest for clean energy resources amidst the growing energy crisis. While MOF materials have demonstrated significant progress in binary C2H2/CH4,&#160;C2H4/CH4,&#160;C2H6/CH4, and CO2/CH4&#160;separations, there is a growing emphasis on the purification of CH4 from multicomponent gas mixtures using a single adsorbent. Toward this direction, a 2D MOF: IITKGP&#8208;27, {[Zn(MBPz) (SO2DBA)]&#183;4H2O}n featuring rhombus pores decorated with polar functionalities has been strategically constructed displaying remarkable chemical robustness in water for 7 days, across a wide range of aqueous pH solutions (pH&#160;=&#160;2&#8211;12), and in open air for 30 days. Interestingly, IITKGP&#8208;27 selectively adsorb C2 hydrocarbons (C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6) and CO2 over CH4, attributed to the synergistic effect of favorable host&#8211;guest (C2S and CO2) interactions due to the presence of accessible surface functionalities and optimal pore apertures. Moreover, an excellent trade&#8208;off between high sorption capacities and moderate separation selectivities was achieved. Transient breakthrough simulations further validated its feasibility toward unexplored CH4 purification from a blend of all such five gases mimicking natural gas composition, demonstrating its viability for this critical application. In addition, the facile bulk scalability, ease of regeneration, excellent recyclability, and outstanding structural stability highlight its potential as a robust solution for efficient CH4 purification from natural gas streams.

         <title>The Dinuclear Zirconocene Complex [(Cp2Zr)2(&#956;&#8208;Me)(&#956;&#8208;C2Ph)] as a Platform for Small Molecule Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 26, May 8, 2025. </description>

The reported dinuclear zirconocene alkynyl methyl complex represents a multifaceted platform for the activation of small molecules. While reduction reactions furnish unusual di&#8208; and trinuclear hydride complexes, reactions with nitriles result in coordination and reduction of the substrate. Detailed structural and computational analysis gives insights into the structure and bonding of these species.








Abstract
The dinuclear title compound [(Cp2Zr)2(&#956;&#8208;Me)(&#956;&#8208;C2Ph)] 5 was prepared from a zirconocene alkynyl methyl complex and Rosenthal's zirconocene source [Cp2Zr(py)(&#951;2&#8208;Me3SiC2SiMe3)] in a formal comproportionation reaction. This complex shows catalytic activity for the dehydrocoupling of amine boranes, with a dinuclear hydride&#8208;bridged alkynyl complex 6 being formed as a catalytically relevant species. The structure of this complex was confirmed for the first time by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. The reaction of complex 5 with hydrogen results in hydrogenation of the alkynyl ligand, yielding a highly labile trinuclear hydride&#8208;bridged complex as a possible intermediate of zirconocene dihydride/ethylbenzene formation. This complex shows an unusual distorted planar tetracoordinate environment at the central carbon atom positioned between the three Zr centers. The reaction of complex 5 with 2&#8208;cyanopyridine and acetonitrile is characterized by a reduction of the substrates. The herein reported reactivity of complex 5 demonstrates the remarkable potential of well&#8208;established dinuclear zirconocenes to stabilize unusual bond situations, which were analyzed comprehensively using spectroscopic, structural, and computational methods.

A novel class of ionic supramolecular adhesives based on polydisulfide polymers was constructed to achieve ultra&#8208;low dosage, enhanced adhesion performance, multi&#8208;environmental tolerance, and on&#8208;demand adhesion release. These properties are attributed to the intrinsic ordered polymer network structure and small molecule doping, which stabilizes the network and reduces chain entanglement.








Abstract
The environmental persistence and widespread application of conventional polymer adhesives raise critical concerns regarding network design complexity and long&#8208;term residue accumulation. Herein, we present a water&#8208;soluble supramolecular adhesive synthesized from natural small molecules. Unlike traditional polymer networks relying on weak intermolecular forces, this system establishes a robust ordered architecture through dynamic disulfide bond ring&#8208;opening polymerization and carboxylate ion electrostatic interactions. Water&#8208;soluble hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) strategically increases hydrogen&#8208;bonding site density while stabilizing the network topology, efficiently reducing chain entanglement. These synergistic effects endow the material with strong adhesion capability even at minimal usage (&#8764;0.4&#160;mg/cm2), achieving a maximum adhesion strength capable of supporting up to 107 times its weight while maintaining considerable resistance to various environmental factors, including thermal extremes (&#8722;80&#176;C to 120&#176;C) and exposure to organic solvents. This supramolecular design paradigm offers an eco&#8208;friendly alternative to conventional polymeric adhesives.

         <title>Efficient Access of Heterocycles Utilizing Inherent Carbodicationic Reactivity of Ynone via Lewis Acid Catalysed C&#9472;C Triple Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient silver&#8208;catalysed triple cascade reaction has been developed to afford easy access to quinazolinone, quinazoline, and benzazole utilizing the gem&#8208;carbodicationic character of ynone. This triple cascade reaction involves sequential conjugate addition followed by Grob&#8208;type fragmentation assisted by stereoelectronic effect. Complex heterocycles have been synthesised by combining this triple cascade reaction followed by a cross&#8208;coupling reaction in the same synthetic sequence.








Abstract
Divalent carbodicationic synthon has attracted significant attention due to its unique reactivity and bonding. The application of this synthon in synthetic settings is still fancy owing to its super&#8208;electrophilicity. Generation of this reactive intermediate in a catalytic fashion is challenging. For the first time, the reactivity of the chemical equivalent of divalent dication synthon has been proposed via Lewis acid&#8208;catalysed heterolytic ionisation of ynone via sequential conjugate addition to ynone followed by C&#9472;C bond cleavage to afford heteroarenes. A library of quinazolinones and 2&#8208;substituted quinazolinones has been synthesised with good to excellent yields having a wide range of functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope using 2&#8208;amino benzamides as a nucleophilic partner. Furthermore, 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzenes afforded the corresponding benzimidazole in synthetically good yield. The generality of this strategy has been demonstrated by the successful synthesis of 6&#8208;mono and 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;substituted quinazolinones and 2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;substituted quinazoline with very high efficiency. The mechanistic study confirmed the role of the cooperative effect and secondary orbital interaction in Grob&#8208;type fragmentation and not the involvement of any radical intermediate in the catalytic cycle.

         <title>The Role of Ion Size and &#960;&#8208;Interaction in Stabilizing Calix[4]arene Crown Ether Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study systematically investigates the influence of ion size on the structure and stability of complexes formed between the calix[4]arene crown ether 1,3&#8208;alt&#8208;25,27&#8208;bis(3,7&#8208; dimethyloctyl&#8208;1&#8208;oxy)calix[4]arenebenzocrown&#8208;6 (MAXCalix) and mono&#8208; and divalent ions from the alkali and alkaline earth metal series. NMR spectroscopy studies revealed that while MAXCalix efficiently coordinates large ions such as Cs+, it also forms complexes with smaller ions like Na+, highlighting the ligand&#8217;s versatility. The size of the ion directly influences the complex structure, with two distinct structural subtypes identified via NMR and DFT calculations. Additionally, &#960;&#8208;interactions between the cation and the cation&#8208;facing benzene rings of the calix[4]arene backbone play an important role in stabilizing the complex. Larger ions like Cs+ benefit from &#960;&#8208;interactions with both cation&#8208;facing rings, whereas smaller ions like K+ interact with only one ring, if any. These &#960;&#8208;interactions are primarily drivers of the enhanced affinity for Cs+ and the resulting higher complex stability. Competitive NMR studies further confirmed that the complex stability increases with increasing ionic radius, and ions of similar size show comparable stability of their complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient and Rapid Arylation of NH&#8322;&#8208;Unprotected Bromobisindole Ethanamines via Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Coupling: Generating New Leads against Leishmania</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease which presents significant global health challenges due to the lack of effective vaccines and the limitations of existing chemotherapeutics in view of their toxicity, resistance, and high costs. In this study, we realized a library of novel bisindole derivatives as potential anti&#8208;leishmanial agents through a rapid Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reaction, utilizing NH2&#8208;unprotected bromobisindoles ethanamines and boronic acids. Optimization of reaction conditions allowed for the efficient and selective arylation of these substrates, with yields up to 93%. The compounds were screened for their activity against Leishmania infantum promastigotes. Among the tested bisindole derivatives, 3af (bearing a 4&#8208;vinylphenyl moiety) demonstrated potent anti&#8208;leishmanial activity (IC50 = 1.1 &#956;M) with a higher selectivity index (21.8) compared to the reference drug miltefosine (9.8). A significant activity was also retained against intracellular amastigotes. This study establishes a robust methodology for late&#8208;stage functionalization of bisindoles, also highlighting these derivatives' potential as promising leads for antileishmanial drug development.</dc:description>

         <title>Cis&#8208;Chelating Diphosphanes for Intra&#8208;Cavity Nickel(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Ethylene Oligomerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four cis&#8208;chelating diphosphanes derived from cyclodextrins (CDs), each with various intra&#8208;cavity environments, compel NiII or PdII metal centers to reside within &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;CD cavities. Nickel(II) complexes of these metal&#8208;confining ligands act as active catalysts in ethylene oligomerization upon activation with modified methyaluminoxane (MMAO). The size of the cavity and the position of the P2Ni fragment relative to the cavity affect both the activity and selectivity of the reaction. In all instances, 1&#8208;butene is the major product (up to 98% C4 products and 90% 1&#8208;butene within the C4 fraction). Extensive theoretical studies with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods carried out on the most selective system suggest that the CD cavity restricts isomerization pathways by limiting the mobility of the coordinated olefin in this constrained supramolecular environment, thereby enhancing &#945;&#8208;olefin formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrimidine&#8208;Based Four&#8208;Coordinate O^N^O Boron Complexes: Synthesis, Photophysical and Theoretical Studies, and TADF&#8208;Based OLED Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article describes the synthesis, along with the full photophysical and computational characterization, of a series of push&#8208;pull boron complexes comprising a sterically&#8208;hindered donor connected to a pyrimidine&#8208;based O^N^O boron chelate. The dimethylacridan&#8208;functionalized fluorophore appears to be the most emissive in the series, both in toluene solution and in the solid state (as a powder), displaying TADF emission in degassed media due to a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap. This result is in line with a previously reported pyridine analogue, which also exhibits delayed emission. Incorporation of this TADF compound into an organic light&#8208;emitting diode led to the observation of intense electroluminescence, with EQEmax values reaching 9.7%, at a 5 wt% doping concentration.</dc:description>

         <title>Linkage Engineering of Triazine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Selective Photocatalytic Oxidation of Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have garnered significant attention as versatile photocatalysts due to their tunable structure and activity. In this work, linkage engineering is applied to two triazine&#8208;based COFs, yielding TFPT&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF (with C=C linkage) and TFPT&#8208;IM&#8208;COF (with a C=N linkage), respectively. TFPT&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF exhibits better thermal stability and a higher surface area than TFPT&#8208;IM&#8208;COF. More importantly, the C=C linkage in TFPT&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF leads to better optoelectronic properties than the C=N linkage in TFPT&#8208;IM&#8208;COF, as it promotes efficient charge separation and transfer and &#960;&#8208;delocalization, as evidenced by experiments and density functional theory calculations. Consequently, TFPT&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF demonstrates higher activities than TFPT&#8208;IM&#8208;COF for selective photocatalytic oxidation of amines. Notably, a diverse range of amines achieve high conversions to corresponding imines with high selectivities. Superoxide, generated through photoexcited electron transfer to O2, is identified as the predominant reactive oxygen species. This work underscores the pivotal role of linkage engineering in optimizing COFs for selective reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Glycans and Chirality: Stereoselectivity at the Core of DC&#8208;SIGN&#8217;s Recognition. A Novel View of the Optimum Minimal Ligand Epitope</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycans exhibit an unparalleled density of stereochemical information, encoded at the monosaccharide level through multiple stereogenic centers, anomeric configurations, ring tautomerism, and conformational variability. Indeed, chiral recognition is fundamental to the interaction between glycans and proteins. Despite the theoretical risk posed by mirror&#8208;image molecules, the stereochemical diversity of the &#8220;glycan code&#8221; enables similar chiral motifs to arise from both D&#8208; and L&#8208;sugars. Herein, we present an in&#8208;depth investigation of the stereochemical features governing lectin&#8211;glycan recognition, using the well&#8208;characterized human C&#8208;type lectin DC&#8208;SIGN as a model. By combining experimental (STD&#8208;NMR) and computational approaches, we identified a minimal optimal binding epitope recognized by DC&#8208;SIGN. Key binding requirements include the correct chirality of the Ca2+&#8208;coordinating oxygens, an adjacent equatorial hydroxyl group for hydrogen bonding with Glu354, and hydrophobic contacts with Val351. Known ligands L&#8208;fucose and D&#8208;mannose fulfill these criteria. Our results further demonstrate that DC&#8208;SIGN also binds &#945;/&#946;&#8208;L&#8208;galactose, &#945;/&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;rhamnose, and myo&#8208;inositol. Among these, &#945;/&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;rhamnose exhibits higher affinity than &#945;&#8208;OMe&#8208;D&#8208;mannose, while &#945;/&#946;&#8208;L&#8208;galactose binds more strongly than D&#8208;rhamnose and myo&#8208;inositol, albeit with lower affinity than &#945;&#8208;OMe&#8208;L&#8208;fucose. STD&#8208;NMR experiments confirmed that all these ligands share the same core binding epitope.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies for Developing Activity&#8208;Based Luminescent Probes for Imaging and Diagnosing Inflammatory Bowel Diseases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive analysis of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art molecular probes designed to target inflammatory bowel diseases&#8208;specific biomarkers, including oxidative stress mediators and enzymatic biomarkers. By elucidating these mechanisms, this review aims to enhance researchers' understanding and facilitate the future application of molecular probes for more effective IBD diagnosis and monitoring.








Abstract
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have experienced a concerning global increase in incidence over recent decades. The advent of molecular imaging probes has revolutionized real&#8208;time biomarker monitoring in IBD pathophysiology, enabling visualization of critical pathological processes. These probes provide dynamic insights into oxidative stress mediators (including reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species) and enzymatic biomarkers (e.g., caspase&#8208;1, pantetheinase, dipeptidyl peptidase IV, nitroreductase, elastase, myeloperoxidase, and carboxylesterase 2), which are crucial for understanding disease mechanisms. Despite significant technological advancements, there remains a lack of systematic analyses exploring the diagnostic potential and therapeutic monitoring applications of these molecular probes in IBD management. This review comprehensively analyzes the design of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art molecular probes targeting IBD&#8208;specific biomarkers, with particular focus on their detection mechanisms and biological applicability. Through a mechanistic elucidation of detection paradigms, this review aims to guide the development of future probes for diagnosing IBD.

         <title>Peripheral Designed Indigo Bola&#8208;Amphiphiles for Supramolecular Assembled Nanoarchitectonics in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indigo as a biodegradable motif is considerable for constructing a sustainable supramolecular polymer. Considering sustainability prospects, indigo bola&#8208;amphiphiles (IBAs) are designed for which supramolecular assemble as high aspect ratio nanostructures. Instead of using uncommon scandium, bio&#8208;abundant calcium cations can assist in constructing macroscopic materials from IBAs nanostructures with structural packing characterizations.








Abstract
Indigo, an ancient natural dye, featured excellent biodegradability to advance in sustainable polymer. Indigo amphiphiles can pave a way for sustainable supramolecular polymers in aqueous media for potential biomedical functional materials. However, contemporary indigo amphiphiles supramolecular commonly assemble into low aspect ratio nanostructures, which hampers the macroscopic soft scaffolds fabrications and smart functional material applications. In this study, we report a novel peripheral designed indigo bola&#8208;amphiphiles (IBAs), which assemble into high aspect ratio supramolecular nanofibers in aqueous media. By employing a shear&#8208;flow assembly technique with bio&#8208;abundant calcium ions, IBAs assemble across multiple length scales into supramolecular macroscopic scaffolds. The structural characterizations of IBAs macroscopic soft scaffolds show different supramolecular structural packing information by scanning electron microscope and X&#8208;ray scattering/diffraction techniques. Our supramolecular nanoarchitectonic approach indicates the feasibility of using IBAs molecular design to construct supramolecular macroscopic materials with higher structural order for the future smart biofunctional materials and sustainable supramolecular polymer under more environmentally friendly conditions.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Prussian Blue Analogs via a Solid&#8208;Solution Storage Mechanism for Long Cycle Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries Cathodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates a method for synthesizing high&#8208;entropy solid&#8208;solution by incorporating multiple metallic elements into Prussian blue analogs (PBAs). The resulting solid&#8208;solution storage mechanism exhibits not only inhibited phase transitions but also preserved crystalline structure integrity, leading to enhanced electrochemical performance.








Abstract
The open&#8208;framework characteristics of Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have been recognized as advantages for cathode application in Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, lattice distortions during charge&#8208;discharge cycles critically compromise their cyclability. Recent advancements in high&#8208;entropy design strategies have significantly improved structural stability and energy storage efficiency within functional materials. In this study, we developed the high&#8208;entropy PBAs, K1.68 Mn0.21 Cu0.20 Ni0.20 Co0.19 Fe0.20[Fe(CN)6]0.87&#9633;0.13&#183;0.66H2O, via a cost&#8208;effective aqueous co&#8208;precipitation method. Notably, this approach facilitates the concurrent incorporation of five transition metals (Mn, Cu, Ni, Co, and Fe), thereby establishing a stable crystalline framework. Electrochemical characterization demonstrates that the cathode achieves a specific capacity of 124.9 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.025 A g&#8722;1. At various current densities (0.025&#8211;1 A g&#8722;1), the cathode maintains a particular capacity retention of 62.1% during rate testing. Furthermore, the cathode exhibits exceptional cyclability preserving 78.7% capacity at 1 A g&#8722;1 after 3000 cycles. Operando X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirms the formation of a reversible solid&#8208;solution intercalation/extraction mechanism process, which prevents phase transitions and enhances cyclability. This high&#8208;entropy material holds significant potential as a cathode for SIBs, offering high specific capacity and outstanding long&#8208;term cycling stability. These superior properties position it as a competitive candidate for advanced energy storage systems.

1,8&#8208;naphthylene&#8208;based 1,10&#8208;diynes (anti/syn mixture) underwent Rh&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular cycloaddition with alkynoates to afford highly enantioenriched, thermodynamically stable chiral cycloadducts.

Abstract
In this paper, we describe a chiral Rh&#8208;catalyzed [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition of 1,8&#8208;naphthylene&#8208;based 1,10&#8208;diynes of an anti/syn mixture with alkynoates. Thermodynamically stable saddle&#8208;shaped chiral cycloadducts were obtained in good&#8208;to&#8208;high yields and enantiomeric ratios. Hetero [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition using aryl cyanides also proceeded to give the corresponding inherently chiral pyridine&#8208;containing compounds.

         <title>Dihalogens Binding and Activation by Imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;Chalcogenone Model Derivatives: Insight from a Computational Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;chalcogenones react with dihalogens, initially forming a charge&#8208;transfer (CT) adduct, which may evolve to the most stable T&#8208;shaped hypercoordinate (TY) species. However, in silico results show that the CT adduct is more stable than the corresponding TY species for the sulfur and iodine combination. This exception is rationalized within the framework of activation strain analysis.








Abstract
Chalcogenone donors represent a fundamental chemical class of compounds in the treatment of hyperthyroidism; particularly, imidazoline&#8208;based systems are associated with the strongest affinity for I2. Therefore, the reactivity of these types of donors with dihalogens may be insightful to understand the mechanism of action of popular drugs, such as methimazole (1&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;thione, MMI). In this work, the reactivity of 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;chalcogenone (S, Se, Te) with dihalogens X2 (X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br, I) is evaluated for any combination through a systematic computational study. Three different products are found: a linear charge transfer (CT) &#8220;spoke&#8221; adduct, a &#8220;T&#8208;shaped&#8221; intermediate (TI), and a &#8220;T&#8208;shaped&#8221; hypercoordinate species (TY). The halogen and chalcogen effects are discussed separately as for the solvation effects. Furthermore, only the TY species formed from the reaction between 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;thione and I2 resulted to be disfavored with respect to the corresponding CT adduct; therefore, this peculiarity is rationalized in the framework of activation strain analysis. Lastly, a possible alternative mechanism involving the formation of a cationic intermediate species is considered.

         <title>Polyvalent Nucleic Acid Nanoprobes for Cancer Diagnosis and Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on polyvalent nucleic acid&#8208;based nanosystems and their biomedical applications, aiming to provide theoretical guidance for the rational establish of smart polyvalent nucleic acid nanosystems with robust functionalities for facilitated tumor diagnosis and therapy applications.








Abstract
Nucleic acids, as essential biomacromolecules, have garnered considerable scientific interest in diagnosis and therapy owing to their unique molecular characteristics, including sequence&#8208;specific programmability, precise molecular recognition capabilities, and diverse biological functionalities. In recent years, with the deepening of the understanding of the physicochemical properties of nucleic acids and the development of nanotechnology, nucleic acid&#8208;based nanoprobes with sophisticated structures and functions have been gradually developed, opening up a new direction for efficient diagnosis, followed by customized therapy for diseases. Despite the progress, the affinity and stability of nucleic acids to target sites still suffer from severe challenges, especially in complex physiological environments. Polyvalent nucleic acids, integrated with different functional elements, have demonstrated enormous advantages in effectively solving the above limitations by the elaborate design and construction of multifunctional DNA nanostructures, making them promising candidates for smart&#8208;responsive nanoprobes. In this review, we commence with an exploration of nucleic acids, subsequently delineating state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies for the fabrication of polyvalent nucleic acid nanostructures. We then predominantly underscore the latest advancements in these nanostructures as innovative platforms for cancer theranostics. Further, we critically examine the biomedical applications of polyvalent nucleic acids, alongside addressing the prevailing challenges and future prospects in the realm of nucleic acid&#8208;facilitated diagnostics and therapeutics.

         <title>&#946;&#8208;Lactam Ylidenes: An Overlooked Class of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly modular synthetic approach toward four&#8208;membered &#946;&#8208;lactam carbenes (BLCs) is presented. BLCs feature moderate &#963;&#8208;donor and strong &#960;&#8208;acceptor character, leading to a pronounced ambiphilic reactivity which includes the formation of olefinic dimers as well as unprecedented N2&#8208;bridged dimers, oxirane formation with acetone, and fragmentation to ketenimines. Experimental findings are rationalized by DFT calculations.








Abstract
In this study, the underappreciated class of &#946;&#8208;lactam carbenes (BLCs) is revisited and systematically explored.

&lt;p&gt;A highly modular synthetic approach toward four-membered &#946;-lactam carbenes (BLCs) is presented. BLCs feature moderate &#963;-donor and strong &#960;-acceptor character, leading to a pronounced ambiphilic reactivity which includes the formation of olefinic dimers as well as unprecedented N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-bridged dimers, oxirane formation with acetone, and fragmentation to ketenimines. Experimental findings are rationalized by DFT calculations.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, the underappreciated class of &#946;-lactam carbenes (BLCs) is revisited and systematically explored. The required precursors are available in a highly modular synthetic approach from simple starting materials. Two routes may be followed for the generation of the free BLCs: thermal fragmentation of spiro-fused oxadiazoles (110&#160;&#176;C, toluene), or deprotonation of carbene HCl-adducts at &#8722;80&#160;&#176;C with a strong base. TEP values (2065&#8211;2072&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), &lt;sup&gt;77&lt;/sup&gt;Se NMR shifts of selenium-adducts (812&#8211;995&#160;ppm), as well as DFT calculations reveal moderate &#963;-donor and strong &#960;-acceptor character of BLCs, leading to a pronounced ambiphilic reactivity.

         <title>Stannylenes Bearing an Amino&#8208;Linked NHC Ligand as Efficient Catalysts for Hydroboration of Carbonyls and Imines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a series of three&#8208;coordinate stannylenes featuring an amino&#8208;linked NHC ligand. The bis(trimethylsilyl)amino derivative showed excellent catalytic efficiency in hydroboration of aldehydes, ketones, and imines under mild conditions. These findings demonstrate the promise of NHC&#8208;supported stannylenes as versatile tin(II) catalysts, for efficient and selective hydroboration using main group elements.








Abstract
We designed and synthesized a series of three&#8208;coordinated stannylenes featuring an amino&#8208;linked NHC ligand, specifically tailored for the hydroboration of carbonyl compounds and imines. To fine&#8208;tune the catalytic performance both sterically and electronically, various substituents (chloro, triflate, and bis(trimethylsilyl)amino groups) were introduced at the tin center, generating structurally diverse stannylenes. The molecular structures of these stannylenes were confirmed by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The hydroboration of carbonyl compounds catalyzed by these stannylenes proceeded under mild reaction conditions, affording the corresponding boryl esters in excellent yields with high chemoselectivity. Notably, bis(trimethylsilyl)aminostannylene exhibited outstanding catalytic efficiency, enabling hydroboration with a minimal catalyst loading of 0.01 mol% for aldehydes and 0.1 mol% for ketones, and was tolerant of a wide range of substrates, including sterically hindered and electronically diverse carbonyl compounds. Furthermore, in the hydroboration of imines, the reaction proceeded efficiently with just 5 mol% catalyst, furnishing the corresponding borylamines in high yields. Based on stoichiometric experiments, we propose a plausible catalytic cycle for stannylene&#8208;mediated hydroboration.

         <title>The Energetics of Electron Transfer in Redox&#8208;DNA Layers Mimics That of Redox Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron transfer in ferrocene&#8208;labeled DNA (Fc&#8208;DNA) layers mimics that of redox proteins, featuring a low reorganization energy (&#955;). The origin of the low &#955; in Fc&#8208;DNA was unveiled by high&#8208;scan&#8208;rate cyclic voltammetry and molecular dynamics simulations, implying Fc&#8208;DNA as a versatile tool to open new avenues in understanding the ET in biological systems and optimizing the electrochemical applications in biosensing and energy conversion.








Abstract
Redox&#8208;DNA layers have recently shown unique properties, such as tunable reorganization energy of electron transfer that can be modulated by DNA length or hybridization state and completely suppressed under nanoconfinement. These discoveries, attributed to the changes in the solvation of the redox marker and/or fast chain dynamics, provide a unique opportunity to use electrochemical measurements as a tool to address open questions in ion solvation. Moreover, they offer a pathway to clarify the origin of the largely unsolved problem of establishing low activation barriers for biological electron transfer. Here, high&#8208;scan&#8208;rate, variable&#8208;temperature cyclic voltammetry analyzed using the Marcus formalism and molecular dynamics simulations, reveals that the total free energy barrier of electron transfer consists of two additive elements: the reorganization energy of the partially desolvated redox marker and the energy cost for solvation changes of the redox marker at the solid/liquid interface. These results may have profound implications for our understanding of electron transfer and solvation effects in redox proteins, providing opportunities for better design of artificial photosynthetic systems, biosensing, and energy conversion devices.

         <title>Fluorescent Deferoxamine Complexes of Cu(II) and Zr(IV): Insights in the Development of Dual Imaging Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deferoxamine (DFO) is widely regarded as benchmark chelator for 89Zr(IV), a commonly used PET (Positron Emission Tomography) tracer. We have introduced a novel fluorescent coumarin derivative of DFO (DFOKC), characterized by chelating unit and fluorophore covalently linked via a lysine molecule. This design introduces a free primary amine group, which, in perspective, can be functionalized with biological vectors, potentially improving tumour tissue selectivity. Its acid&#8208;base and metal coordination properties toward Cu(II) and Zr(IV) ions were thoroughly characterized using UV&#8208;Vis and fluorescence emission spectroscopy. DFOKC strongly coordinates both metal ions, forming somewhat more stable complexes than DFO, while retaining fluorescence emission, thus enabling dual&#8208;mode optical and PET imaging. Biodistribution assays conducted on NIH&#8208;3T3 fibroblasts, and MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines demonstrated that the presence of primary amine groups favours Zr&#8208;DFOKC complex cell internalization via pinocytosis compared to the parent molecule DFOC, in which the fluorophore is linked to the amine group of DFO. Furthermore, crystal violet and MTT assays revealed no cytotoxic effects or mitochondrial impairment, even at concentrations higher than those typically used for radiodiagnostic applications. These results strongly support the potential of DFOKC as a versatile and promising tool for dual imaging, offering significant advantages in molecular imaging.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;throughput asymmetric reaction development of an organocatalytic Michael addition is achieved by using a readily available isatin molecule as amine protecting group, reagent for reactivity Umpolung, and as chiroptical yield and enantioselectivity reporter. The use of UV and circular dichroism inductions allows on the fly, chromatography&#8208;free parallel screening of hundred reaction conditions to identify a catalytic procedure that converts a primary amine to either enantiomer of an alpha&#8208;branched chiral product in excellent yields and ee&#8217;s. The isatin is recyclable and can be quantitatively recovered if desirable. This case study shows how chiroptical high&#8208;throughput screening with a multitasking reagent can increase method development speed and reduce cost and waste compared to traditional reaction optimization workflows by streamlining the analysis of small&#8208;scale reaction setups and eliminating time&#8208;consuming work&#8208;up protocols.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling New Triazoloquinoxaline&#8208;based PROTACs Designed for the Selective Degradation of the ncBAF Chromatin Remodeling Subunit BRD9</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>PROteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) technology is an innovative and potent approach for achieving targeted protein degradation (TPD). Within bromodomain&#8208;containing proteins, various degraders targeting BET family&#8208;related targets, e.g., BRD4, were developed in the last years. On the other hand, a limited number of PROTACs acting against non&#8208;BET proteins have been reported so far. Among them, BRD9 has been recently linked to oncogenic roles in the tumorigenesis processes, especially in sarcomas and leukemias. Herein, we describe the design and synthesis of a focused collection of new BRD9&#8208;targeting degraders based on the [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3&#8208;a]quinoxaline heterocyclic scaffold employing two distinct E3 ubiquitin ligase ligands. Through in silico evaluation, synthesis, binding affinity determination, and in vitro analysis, we identified two new VHL&#8208;based PROTACs (2 and 9), which showed remarkable degradation of the protein of interest and antiproliferative activity in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Notably, compound 9 exhibited selective degradation of BRD9 over BRD7. These results enlarge and differentiate the pool of heterobifunctional molecules able to degrade BRD9 through the proteasome machinery, providing a promising reference for the discovery of new tools to further explore both the involvement of this epigenetic regulatory factor in tumor processes and to evaluate novel strategies for AML treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Coupling CoOx@NC with NiFe LDH Enhances Oxygen Electrocatalysis for Rechargeable High&#8208;Efficiency Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing bifunctional catalysts with the high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic activities is of great significance in improving the efficiency of rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries. Herein, this study adopts simple one&#8208;pot pyrolysis and subsequent hydrothermal strategies to prepare a high&#8208;performance bifunctional composite catalyst by coupling a layered hydroxide NiFe LDH with Co and N codoped carbon framework, composed of cobalt oxide and metallic Co nanoparticles distributed on interconnected porous carbon nanosheets and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Benefiting from the exposure of more active sites, high conductivity, and beneficial charge transport advantages, the best catalyst (CoOx@NC)2&#8208;NiFe demonstrates excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activities and stability for oxygen&#8208;related electrochemical reactions, exhibiting a low potential gap of 0.757 V. Additionally, the rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery assembled with the (CoOx@NC)2&#8208;NiFe catalyst performs a peak power density of 136 mW cm&#8208;2, and a specific capacity of 803 mAh gZn&#8208;1 at 10 mA cm&#8208;2, and outstanding stability (over 200 h). This work presents a simple and low&#8208;cost approach for synthesizing bifunctional catalysts to realize efficient and durable rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfate Recognition in Water via Charge&#8208;Assisted Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving selective molecular recognition of hydrophilic anions in water remains a formidable challenge due to the competitive nature of water and the high hydration energies of target anions such as sulfate. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of a simple dicationic tetralactam macrocycle (BPTL2+&#183;2Cl&#8722;) capable of binding highly hydrated anions in water via charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonding. Structural, spectroscopic, thermodynamic, and computational studies reveal that BPTL2+ exhibits a strong binding affinity for sulfate (Ka = 2892 M&#8722;1), driven primarily by entropic gain from water release and reinforced by electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and DFT&#8208;optimized structures confirm the formation of directional [N&#8211;H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O] and [C&#8211;H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O] hydrogen bonds. Comparative studies with a control macrocycle (HCTL6&#8722;) that has a charge&#8208;neutral binding cavity underscore the essential role of cationic charge in overcoming desolvation enthalpic penalties. The receptor displays unusual anti&#8208;Hofmeister selectivity, preferentially binding more hydrophilic anions. This work provides fundamental insights into the mechanisms of anion recognition in water and establishes charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonding as a powerful strategy for developing next&#8208;generation receptors for sensing, separation, sequestration, transport, and catalysis in aqueous environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of a Deep&#8208;Red Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission&#8208;Active Iridium Complex for Plant Cell Wall Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plant cell wall imaging has received consistent attention in characterizing and monitoring the structure and health of plant tissues. To overcome current drawbacks of plant cell wall staining, such as source limitations, low specificity, auto&#8208;fluorescence interference, in this work we present the rational design of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active, deep&#8208;red emissive iridium complex as a specific staining agent of plant cell wall. Cell wall probe [Ir(dpyb)2(iqbtz)]+ (Ir&#8208;CW), bearing two rotatable pyridyl moieties, is designed to selective binding to pectin, one of the major components of the cell wall that carries rich carboxylic residues on its polymer chain. The AIE properties, pectin sensing behaviors, pectin binding mechanism and practical application of cell wall staining of Ir&#8208;CW are performed. Results demonstrate that Ir&#8208;CW exhibit pectin&#8208;responsive AIE properties and selective pectin binding against common interfering species including metal ions, anions, amino acids and saccharides. Notably, Ir&#8208;CW can specifically stain plant cell walls with better performance than Congo red, a commercial cell wall staining agent. This work highlights the rationales of developing novel iridium complexes for cell wall staining, and widely broadening their applications as powerful tools for botanical studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Ru&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxygenative Functionalization of Phenols via &#960;&#8208;Coordination Activation: Mechanochemical Access to N&#8208;Aryl Amides and &#945;&#8208;Aryl Carbonyls.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the vast occurrence and availability of both primary amides and phenols, the synthesis of N&#8208;aryl amides via direct coupling between these starting materials would be much attractive. Herein, we report an efficient method for the mechanochemical synthesis of N&#8208;aryl amides via ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed direct amidation of unprotected phenols with primary amides with water as the sole byproduct. Unexpectedly, replacing amides with methyl carboxylic acids, esters, or ketones led to the formation of &#945;&#8208;aryl carbonyl derivatives instead of the anticipated aryl carboxylates. The synthetic strategy accepts a wide scope of primary amides, alkyl carbonyls and phenolic substrates to deliver the twenty&#8208;eight expected N&#8208;aryl amides and fourteen unexpected &#945;&#8208;aryl carbonyl derivatives with good to excellent yields. The developed synthetic approach would serve as the better alternative to the classical cross&#8208;coupling reactions in context to the PASE (pot, atom, and step economy) synthesis and late&#8208;stage modification of structurally complex molecules, including natural products and pharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

         <title>A convergent approach to resorcinolic macrolides to expand structural diversity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The resorcinolic macrolide (RM) family comprises over 50 natural products with diverse biological activities, including the potent natural Hsp90 inhibitor radicicol. Here, we report a modular and enantioselective synthetic strategy featuring a biomimetic macrocyclization&#8211;aromatization cascade that enables rapid access to natural and unnatural RMs. Using this route, we generated a small panel of minimal RMs, introducing covalent warheads, double bonds for macrocycle rigidification, and modifications at the C15 position, a position that has not been modified before. We also synthesized macrocyclic peptide&#8208;RM hybrids, offering a platform for rapid diversification. We evaluated all analogs for inhibitory activity against Hsp90&#945; and Hsp90&#946; and for disruption of the KRasG12C&#8211;CRAF protein&#8211;protein interaction (PPI). We found that introduction of polar groups at C15 improved Hsp90 activity relative to the representative RM de&#8208;O&#8208;methyllasiodiplodin, dependent on stereochemistry, whereas introduction of larger groups at C15 or introduction of a trans double bond into the macrocycle reduced activity. Two analogs with poor Hsp90 inhibitory activity exhibited dose&#8208;dependent inhibition of the KRasG12C&#8211;CRAF PPI. This work demonstrates that strategic modifications of a minimal RM scaffold through modular chemical insight can provide foundational structure&#8211;activity relationships for the class.</dc:description>

Two analogs with poor Hsp90 inhibitory activity exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of the KRasG12C&#8211;CRAF PPI. This work demonstrates that strategic modifications of a minimal RM scaffold through modular chemical insight can provide foundational structure&#8211;activity relationships for the class.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Arylboronic Acid Catalyzed Reductive Alkylation of Azoarenes to N&#8208;Alkylated Hydrazines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrazine derivatives are generally difficult to prepare despite their appealing structural simplicity. The synthetic challenge is likely to arise from either the similar reactivity or the relatively low activity of the two nitrogen&#8217;s in a hydrazine precursor. The former would lead to severe selectivity issues while the latter would require harsh reaction conditions. Herein, we have developed a new and efficient method for constructing N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;diarylhydrazines by arylboronic acid&#8208;catalyzed an one&#8208;pot tandem reduction of azoarene to hydrazoarene followed by reductive alkylation with the aldehyde and Hantzsch ester. The use of mild reaction conditions offers to provide tri&#8208;substituted hydrazine derivatives and suppress the N&#8208;N cleaved product amines and/or imines. The reaction is highly chemoselective and tolerates a wide variety of hydrogenation&#8208;sensitive functional groups. Method has been successfully utilized in the late&#8208;stage functionalization, diversification of pharmaceuticals. The mechanistic study demonstrates the unique behaviour of boron&#8208;based catalysts as both Lewis acids and hydrogen&#8208;bond donors. Based on the thermodynamic activation parameters, kinetic Hammett studies, and competitive reaction on the substrate, it has been postulated that iminium formation step is likely to be the rate&#8208;limiting step.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We present a synergistic phosphine&#8208;photoredox catalytic strategy for the direct dicyanation of styrenes with TMSCN. This approach utilizes a phosphorus radical cation to initiate an oxidative radical&#8208;polar crossover with alkenes, followed by sequential nucleophilic cyanation, enabling the efficient synthesis of alkyl 1,2&#8208;dinitriles from alkenes. Further synthetic transformations of these dinitrile motifs and mechanistic insights into the reaction pathway have been demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>1,3&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;Zwitterionic Complexes of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes in Reactions with Arylallenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of 2&#8208;arylcyclopropane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates (ACDC) with GaCl3 and other Lewis acids in the presence of 3&#8208;arylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;dienes, which acts as a trapping agent for the 1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;zwitterionic intermediates being generated, has been studied. The reaction of 1,2&#8208;zwitterionic gallium complexes at low temperature has been found to give products of annulation at the phenyl substituent in the allene, 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;(inden&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethylmalonates, as the main products. Only in the case of naphthylcyclopropanedicarboxylate, the formation of a polycyclic frame by annulation at both aromatic moieties occurred upon an increase in temperature to 0&#176;C. Trapping of 1,3&#8208;zwitterions, the primary intermediates of cyclopropane ring opening, by the indicated allene was most successful if catalytic amounts of GaCl3 were added directly to the reaction mixture. In this case, the reaction followed the pathway of the usual formal (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition of 1,3&#8208;zwitterions at each of the double bonds of the allene to give the corresponding exo&#8208;methylenecyclopentane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates in up to 93% yields. This process occurred with the highest efficiency at the unsubstituted double bond of 3&#8208;arylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;diene.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Generation by Cyclization of an Organic Structure Directing Agent for the Synthesis of High Silica Zeolite ERS&#8208;7</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic route is established to high silica zeolite ERS&#8208;7 templated by a dimethylpyrrolidinium organic structure directing agent (OSDA) in the presence of a cationic polymer, both formed in situ from organic precursors. The polymer enables the cyclization that gives the OSDA and inhibits the crystallization of the competing zeolite mordenite.








Abstract
Zeolites with high framework Si/Al ratios are of interest for industrial applications due to their hydrothermal stability. They are usually synthesized in the presence of pre&#8208;prepared organic structure directing agents (OSDAs). The high silica ERS&#8208;7 zeolite (topology type ESV) can be crystallized using N,N&#8208;dimethylpyrrolidinium (dmpyrr) that is formed in situ via cyclization of N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diaminobutane (tmdab) when a cationic polymer is also present. The in situ generation of dmpyrr is demonstrated by solid&#8208;state 13C NMR spectroscopy and supported by both chemical analyses and comparative syntheses using pre&#8208;prepared dmpyrr. The cationic polymer inhibits the crystallization of mordenite, which is otherwise observed to be the favored product. The ERS&#8208;7 prepared via in situ dmpyrr synthesis (Si/Al = 14) is characterized by PXRD and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The CO2 adsorption seen for the H&#8208; and Na&#8208;forms indicates interactions with accessible Na+ cations. The synthetic studies indicate the potential for in situ generation of OSDAs to reduce the need for extended OSDA syntheses.

         <title>Copper (II) Triflate/ Vitamin&#8208;C Promoted Modified Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman Annulation: A Facile Route to Fluorescent Cyclopentene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a copper triflate (Cu(OTf)2) promoted Intramolecular Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman(IMBH) annulation protocol is reported for the synthesis of fused cyclopentenoids which in turn act as molecular sensors for hazardous amine detection. A characteristic interconversion via 1,5&#8208;H shift between two non&#8208;separable isomeric mixtures of cyclopentene derivatives, and a solvent&#8208;free organic acid mediated version of the protocol, provide exciting dimensions to this work.








Abstract
Herein we report a rapid and efficient method for the synthesis of fused cyclopentenoids via Intramolecular Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (IMBH) annulation.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, a copper triflate (Cu(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) promoted Intramolecular Morita-Baylis-Hillman(IMBH) annulation protocol is reported for the synthesis of fused cyclopentenoids which in turn act as molecular sensors for hazardous amine detection. A characteristic interconversion via 1,5-H shift between two non-separable isomeric mixtures of cyclopentene derivatives, and a solvent-free organic acid mediated version of the protocol, provide exciting dimensions to this work.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein we report a rapid and efficient method for the synthesis of fused cyclopentenoids via Intramolecular Morita-Baylis-Hillman (IMBH) annulation. In this approach, copper triflate (Cu(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) serves as the promoter, favoring cyclization and aromatization over the conventional MBH addition product. A characteristic feature among most of the cyclized product contain two non-separable isomeric mixture of cyclopentene derivatives which has been readily interconverted via 1,5-H shift. This sigmatropic shift has been proved via deuterium labelling experiment using the first synthesized 1-bromo-6-methoxy-3,4-dihydronaphthalene-2-carbaldehyde-d. The equilibration of two cyclopentadiene ring via sigmatropic shift has also been characterized by 2D NMR experiment. The scale-up experiment in the modified IMBH reaction also flourish our protocol significantly. Additionally, the same compounds have also been synthesized in solvent-free conditions using organic acids, which reduces the use of hazardous substances, providing an alternate pathway for the IMBH reaction avoiding conventional aqueous work-up.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Based Design of Metallocene Catalysts for Controlled Olefin Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To design catalysts for ethylene/hexene copolymerization, a virtual screening scheme combining predictive models with a genetic algorithm was proposed. Chemically intuitive descriptors obtained from mechanism analysis improve the generalizability of models, effectively predicting catalysts with new core structures not included in the fitting set. This scheme is used to design new zirconocene catalysts with desired properties and diverse core structures.








Abstract
Polyolefins are versatile materials for various purposes, but their functionality should be fine&#8208;tuned for target applications including the mitigation of adverse environmental impacts. Producing such polymers with desired properties requires catalysts that can control polymerization at an atomistic level. However, complex reaction mechanisms and very limited experimental data make it difficult to design new efficient catalysts using conventional computational and data&#8208;driven approaches. Here, we present a pragmatic strategy based on data&#8208;efficient predictive models combined with a genetic algorithm to design new catalysts for controlled ethylene/hexene copolymerization. By deriving the chemically intuitive descriptors from the mechanistic analysis of the polymerization, we achieved the promising predictive models with small data applicable to various core structures and different experimental conditions, respectively. We screened catalysts through a virtual screening scheme combining a genetic algorithm and predictive models using chemically intuitive descriptors and considered their synthesizability through the manual inspections of experts. As a result, we successfully designed nine catalysts with desired comonomer ratios and diverse core structures.

         <title>The Dugganite Structure as a Host for New Colored Compounds and for Oxygen Evolution Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A family compounds with the general formula A3BC3D2O14 (A = Pb, Ba, Sr; B = Te, Sb; C = Al, Ga, Fe, Zn; D = P, V, As, Si, Ge) stabilised in the dugganite structure has been prepared and characterized. The transition metal ions substituted at the tetrahedral sites in place of Zn2+ ions, gave rise to brightly colored compounds. The origin of colors in the compounds were understood based on the allowed d&#8208;d transitions and possible metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (MMCT) transitions involving the different transition elements. The white compounds exhibited good near infrared ( NIR) reflectivity as well as deep UV &#8208; cut off (85&#8208;90%), which indicates possible use as UV&#8208;NLO materials. The compounds exhibited reasonable second harmonic generation (SHG) activity with values that are 3&#8211; 5 times higher than KDP. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) studies on Pb3TeCo3V2O14 and Pb3Te(Co2Fe)(VSi)O14, exhibited good OER behavior in alkaline medium with long &#8211; term stability. The change in the band gap values for the transition metal substituted compounds were understood through density functional theory calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide Nanogel Synthesis: Exploring the Role of Reaction Parameters and Crosslinking Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study provides a detailed account of the use of microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis as a novel and efficient method for preparing monodisperse poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) nanogels. The synthesis, based on free radical precipitation copolymerization of NIPAM and crosslinkers in water, was accelerated by microwave irradiation. Crosslinkers such as ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) and degradable bis&#8208;acryloylcystamine (BAC) were employed to study their effects on nanogel structure and properties, including their temperature&#8208;responsive behavior. HPLC analysis revealed differences in monomer and crosslinker conversion between the two agents. The growth of the nanogel particles was analyzed at various polymerization times using dynamic light scattering (DLS), &#950;&#8208;potential measurements and cryo&#8208;TEM imaging. The data showed that microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis reduced reaction time from 6 hours to minutes. BAC produced uniformly crosslinked nanogels, while EGDMA formed nanogels with dense cores and loose PNIPAM shells. Stability studies during storage and in biologically relevant media indicated their potential for biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Boost of Chiroptical Responses through the Enhancement of Electron Transition Dipole Moment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of robust chiroptical systems is crucial for advancing optoelectronic technologies. Spirobifluorenes (SBFs) have proven to be versatile scaffolds for the construction of a wide variety of robust axially chiral compounds presenting strong chiroptical responses. Herein, we present a strategy for boosting the chiroptical responses via enhancing electric transition dipole moment (ETDM) of interacting chromophores in C2&#8208;symmetric SBFs presenting exciton coupling. To experimentally validate this approach, we peripherally extended the SBF scaffold through Knoevenagel condensation with the aim of increasing the ETDM of the featured chromophores. The influence of the functionalization on the ETDM was investigated using a combination of computational modeling and experimental techniques, enabling a detailed examination of the relationship between molecular structure and chiroptical properties. Our results demonstrate that peripheral functionalization of SBFs significantly enhances the electric transition dipole moment (ETDM) of the constituent chromophores, with each incremental increase in ETDM resulting in a five&#8208;fold enhancement of the g&#8208;factor, thereby substantially amplifying the overall chiroptical activity. This straightforward strategy underscores the importance of the ETDM of interacting chromophores in fine&#8208;tuning the optoelectronic properties and provides a promising avenue for the rational design of high&#8208;performance chiroptical materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanded Structural Design of Organic Ionic Plastic Crystals Based on&#160;Linear Tris&#8208;Pyrrolidinium Salt</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic ionic plastic crystal (OIPC) materials exhibit soft solid phases within a specific temperature range, making them promising candidates for various electrochemical devices due to their intrinsic ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. In this study, a series of linear tris&#8208;pyrrolidinium salts with different alkyl side chain lengths and counter&#8208;anions were synthesized and systematically characterized in terms of their structural, thermal, and electrochemical properties. Among the synthesized compounds, N,N&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(N&#8217;&#8208;undecylpyrrolidinium)butyl)pyrrolidinium tris&#8208;hexafluorophosphate (11&#8208;PF6) exhibited two solid&#8208;solid phase transitions, and a low fusion entropy (&#916;Sf) of 13 J&#8729;K&#8208;1&#8729;mol&#8208;1 at 210 &#176;C. Similarly, N,N&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(N&#8217;&#8208;dodecylpyrrolidinium)butyl)pyrrolidinium tris&#8208;hexafluorophosphate (12&#8208;PF6) showed multiple phase transitions with a low &#916;Sfof 18 J&#8729;K&#8208;1&#8729;mol&#8208;1 at 206 &#176;C. The temperature&#8208;dependent soft crystalline phases of 11&#8208;PF6 were identified as plastic crystal phase using polarized optical microscopy and 1D wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (WAXS). The ionic conductivity of 11&#8208;PF6 was measured to be 2.04&#215;10&#8208;6 S&#8729;cm&#8208;1 at 70 &#176;C. Upon blending with 80 mol% LiTf2N, the ionic conductivity significantly increased to 1.16&#215;10&#8208;4 S&#8729;cm&#8208;1. Electrochemical stability was evaluated via linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The composite solid electrolyte consisting of 11&#8208;PF6 and 80 mol% LiTf2N exhibited electrochemical stability up to 5.4 V (vs. Li/Li+), highlighting its potential as a high&#8208;voltage electrolyte component.</dc:description>

The temperature-dependent soft crystalline phases of 11-PF6 were identified as plastic crystal phase using polarized optical microscopy and 1D wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). The ionic conductivity of 11-PF6 was measured to be 2.04&#215;10-6 S&#8729;cm-1 at 70 &#176;C. Upon blending with 80 mol% LiTf2N, the ionic conductivity significantly increased to 1.16&#215;10-4 S&#8729;cm-1. Electrochemical stability was evaluated via linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The composite solid electrolyte consisting of 11-PF6 and 80 mol% LiTf2N exhibited electrochemical stability up to 5.4 V (vs. Li/Li+), highlighting its potential as a high-voltage electrolyte component.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Constant pH Molecular Dynamics Simulation of pH Effects on Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Structure, Dynamics and Metal&#8208;Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first molecular dynamics simulations to examine the effect of pH on the structure, dynamics and metal&#8208;binding ability of amyloid&#8208;&#946;, the peptide implicated in onset of Alzheimer's disease. We show that in the pH range of 6 to 8 only histidine residues show variable protonation, that predicted pKa values are in agreement with experimental data, and that changes in pH affect size, flexibility and secondary structure of the peptide. Binding of Cu(II) or Zn(II) to the peptide induces a shift of 1 to 1.5 pKa units in unbound histidine residues, while metal binding modes associated with higher pH induce significant changes in peptide structure. We speculate on the significance of these findings on results showing pH dependence as well as on Cu(II) and Zn(II) modulation of aggregation of Amyloid&#8208;&#946;.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Cobaltabis(dicarbollide) Catalysts Prepared Using a Silica Helical Nanoplatform for the Enantioselective Photooxidation of Aromatic Secondary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cobaltabis(dicarbollide) ([Co(C2B9H11)2]&#8208;) named COSAN has been widely explored in a variety of fields. While COSAN have recently been investigated in catalysis, their chiral counterparts have, to our knowledge, never been investigated in asymmetric catalysis. Inspired by our previous work on the chiral induction of silica helices on achiral objects, we prepared chiral COSAN&#8208;based hybrid silica nanohelices. In these structures, organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid nanohelices serves as a chiral platform for COSAN in enantioselective transformations. These NANOCOSAN were characterized using UV/Vis, Raman soectroscopy, TEM, EELS and NMR spectroscopy. Their optical activity was demonstrated by CD and ROA, highlighting the induction of chirality from chiral hybrid nanohelices to the achiral COSAN. To the best of our knowledge, these NANOCOSAN represent the first examples of COSAN&#8208;based chiral systems displaying chiroptical effects. They show excellent catalytic activity and enantioselectivity in the photooxidation of secondary aromatic alcohols, achieving up to 85% enantiomeric excess (ee). This catalytic experiment demonstrate the transfer of chiroptical properties from the nanohelices to the achiral COSAN, enabling supramolecular asymmetric catalysis. The catalyst was recovered and reused without any loss of catalytic activity or ee. This study reports the first example of COSAN&#8208;containing nanohelices which can promote photooxidation of organic substrates with high enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Template&#8208;Directed Synthesis and Isolation of Unimolecular Oligo[n]catenanes Using a One&#8208;Pot CuAAC &#8220;Click&#8221; Reaction Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Within the field of mechanically interlocked molecules, catenanes have garnered much interest in the past few decades due to their chain&#8208;like architecture of interlocked molecular rings. This interest stems from their unique properties and degrees of freedom that distinguish them from traditional molecular architectures; making catenanes attractive building blocks in the construction of next&#8208;generation polymeric materials. Most approaches to make unimolecular [n]catenanes are either low yielding or rely on multi&#8208;step pathways for preparation and purification. Therefore, developing efficient syntheses for [n]catenanes remains an important challenge for chemists. Here, we describe a template&#8208;directed one&#8208;pot approach that overcomes the limitations of multistep syntheses by using simple, symmetrical phenanthroline&#8208;based precursors and CuAAC &#8216;click&#8217; chemistry to yield a series of unimolecular [n]catenanes. This methodology relies on simultaneous copper(I)&#8208;mediated templation and click chemistry, ultimately producing either a [2]catenane in high yield (82%) or a batch of well&#8208;defined linear [2]&#8208;[5]catenanes (and trace amounts of a [6]catenane) in an 18% overall yield, depending on the rate of addition of the azide&#8208; and alkyne&#8208;functionalized precursors (slow versus rapid addition). Such kinetic control represents a potential pathway towards the preparation of higher order [n]catenanes capable of further chain extension using very simple precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrated ammonia capture and exchange on ion&#8208;exchanged 4A zeolites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia poses a challenge in effluent gas streams due to its corrosive nature. In fusion settings tritiated ammonia can be formed, leading to both tritium loss in inventory and the generation of a reactive species. Identifying pathways in which both tritium can be recovered, and the ammonia can be easily handled would be beneficial. One such way to do so would be to combine two useful techniques: ammonia sequestration and hydrogen exchange (ND3&#8594;NH3). However, materials that can both adsorb ammonia and subsequently perform reactions on ammonia have not been well explored. In this work we present the development of ion&#8208;exchanged A&#8208;type zeolites to be utilized as a support material for platinum catalysts. Thus, the zeolite can adsorb ammonia and the platinum catalyst can facilitate hydrogen exchange allowing for bifunctional reactivity of the material to be achieved. A variety of elements were explored for their effect on A&#8208;type zeolites and resulted in an isotopic difference in the adsorption of ND3 and NH3, noting the use of deuterium as a surrogate for tritium. Several platinum&#8208;impregnated zeolites were able to remove ND3 from the gas stream, indicating that utilizing these materials in isotope recovery processes would improve accountability of these valuable hydrogen isotopes.</dc:description>

         <title>From C&#9472;H Bond Insertion to Hydrogen Atom Transfer: Tuning the Reaction Mechanisms of Methane Activation by the Oxidation of Ta2+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a combined experimental and theoretical study, it is observed that the continued oxidation from Ta2+ to Ta2Ox+ (with x&#160;=&#160;1 &#8211; 6) changes the reactivity with methane from a typical metallic to a typical oxidic behavior. While the bridging motifs in Ta2O2+ enable the dehydrogenation of CH4, the spin density on oxygen atoms in Ta2O5+ facilitates a HAT reaction.








Abstract
The activation of methane under mild conditions is a challenging but rewarding goal; the underlying key parameters, however, remain elusive. In this study on isolated tantalum Ta2+ compounds exposed to methane in a ring&#8208;electrode ion trap, strong changes in the reactivity are observed depending on the compound's degree of oxidation. While the general reaction behavior is presented for species ranging from Ta2+ to Ta2O6+ based on experimental kinetic studies, we focus in more detail on the dehydrogenation reactions occurring on Ta2O2+ and the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) on Ta2O5+, for which density functional theory calculations were performed. In the first part, we elucidate the role of Ta&#8211;C&#8211;Ta bridging motifs in product structures as driving forces for the dehydrogenation of methane on Ta2O2+; in the second part, we investigate the origins of the HAT &#8211; a hitherto unknown reaction scheme for binary tantalum oxides. For the latter, we show that the reactivity originates from the spin density on oxygen atoms, which is a typical characteristic of the reaction on other metal oxides. This reflects a change in the reactivity from oxidized metallic systems to metal oxides and demonstrates that chemical modifications of tantalum compounds can achieve different methane activation schemes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activation of methane under mild conditions is a challenging but rewarding goal; the underlying key parameters, however, remain elusive. In this study on isolated tantalum Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; compounds exposed to methane in a ring-electrode ion trap, strong changes in the reactivity are observed depending on the compound's degree of oxidation. While the general reaction behavior is presented for species ranging from Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; based on experimental kinetic studies, we focus in more detail on the dehydrogenation reactions occurring on Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) on Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, for which density functional theory calculations were performed. In the first part, we elucidate the role of Ta&#8211;C&#8211;Ta bridging motifs in product structures as driving forces for the dehydrogenation of methane on Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;; in the second part, we investigate the origins of the HAT &#8211; a hitherto unknown reaction scheme for binary tantalum oxides. For the latter, we show that the reactivity originates from the spin density on oxygen atoms, which is a typical characteristic of the reaction on other metal oxides. This reflects a change in the reactivity from oxidized metallic systems to metal oxides and demonstrates that chemical modifications of tantalum compounds can achieve different methane activation schemes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Combination of Arsines and Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane Toward Frustrated Lewis Pair</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study systematically investigates the reactivity of arsine&#8211;borane Lewis pairs, which had not been explored previously. Using tertiary arsines with different steric and electronic properties, the formation of classical Lewis adducts, FLP&#8208;type encounter complexes, and arsonium borate adducts with B(C6F5)3 was demonstrated. Their reactivity toward small molecules and detailed structural characterization were also reported.








Abstract
Various combinations of Lewis acids and bases, particularly frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs), have been investigated for their distinctive reactivities. Nevertheless, to date, no systematic study of arsine&#8211;borane Lewis pairs has been reported. In this study, tertiary arsines with different degrees of steric hindrance and electron&#8208;donating abilities were used. Depending on their steric and electronic properties, arsines form classical Lewis adducts, FLPs, or arsonium borate adducts with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (B(C6F5)3). Experimental and computational analyzes revealed that trimesitylarsine and B(C6F5)3 form an encounter complex in solution, which is referred to as an FLP adduct. Furthermore, the arsine&#8211;borane pairs react with phenylacetylene and diphenyl disulfide to afford the corresponding arsonium borate adduct and thioarsonium thioborate salt, respectively. The structures of the products were characterized using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Oxidative Thiolated Aromatization of Terpenes for Divergent Construction of Organosulfur Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convergent and divergent strategy has been developed for the construction of sulfur&#8208;containing terpenoid derivatives using various terpenes with different oxidation states. It is expected that this protocol may be of broad interest in chemistry community pursuing the transformation of terpenes and constitutes a practical alternative to the synthesis of natural products and pharmaceuticals.








Abstract
Synthetic transformation of terpenoids represents a long&#8208;standing research topic in organic synthesis. Due to the presence of multiple oxidation states and isomers in naturally abundant terpenoids, their separation and efficient utilization pose challenges. Convergent transformations of various terpenes can circumvent these issues. We herein developed a convergent and divergent strategy for control of oxidation states, enabling the construction of sulfur&#8208;containing terpenoid derivatives using various terpenes. This protocol features broad substrate scope, good functional compatibility, and high redox&#8208;selectivity. Convergent synthesis strategy was implemented smoothly by using drug and plant extracts. The synthesis of sulfoxide and sulfone products was further achieved by modulating the oxidation conditions, respectively. Additionally, the products can undergo an array of elaborate transformations, which highlight the potential applications of this strategy.

         <title>QM/MM Unlocks The Catalytic Mechanism of YtfE: The Structural Reorganization of The Active Site Enables Nitrite&#8208;to&#8208;NO Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
QM/MM simulations reveal that the structural reorganization of the active site, particularly the alternation of the hydrogen bonding network and coordination switch of the HONO intermediate, is critical for the reductive cleavage of the N&#9472;O bond and NO formation in the nonheme diiron YtfE. This mechanistic insight advances understanding of nitrite reduction in nonheme diiron oxygenases and their biological roles.








Abstract
Escherichia coli (E. coli) repair of iron center protein (also known as YtfE) is a nonheme diiron protein that plays a pivotal role in bacterial responses to nitrosative stress, particularly in nitrite reduction and nitric oxide metabolism. Although previous studies have explored its potential as a nitrite reductase, the detailed catalytic mechanism, especially the role of its diiron center in nitrite reduction, remains poorly understood. In this study, we employed multiscale computational approaches, including quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM), quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics metadynamics (QM/MM MD), and quantum mechanics (QM) calculations, to elucidate the molecular mechanism of nitrite reduction by YtfE. Our findings reveal that structural reorganization of the active site, particularly the alternation of the hydrogen bonding network and coordination switch of the HONO intermediate, is critical for modulating the nitrite reduction mechanism. This work provides significant insights into the catalytic mechanism of YtfE, offering a theoretical foundation for understanding its role in bacterial stress responses and potential applications in synthetic biology and environmental remediation.

         <title>Realizing the Capacity Benefit of Anionic Redox in Stoichiometric Sodium Manganese Oxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully harnessing the capacity benefit of anionic redox reactions requires Na&#8208;stoichiometric compounds with 3d TMs. The successful synthesis of O3&#8208;NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2 marked the first step, which delivers decent capacity with no voltage decay. We provide strategies such as designing chemical composition, multiphase structure, and ordering superstructure to further improve the energy density with anionic redox without sacrificing kinetics and energy efficiency






.

Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries offer a cost&#8208;effective and sustainable alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries, yet their lower energy density remains a challenge. Anionic redox in layered oxide cathodes has the potential to enhance capacity beyond the limits of transition&#8208;metal redox. This potential is maximized in full&#8208;stoichiometric sodium compounds with 3d transition metals, a goal hindered by synthesis challenges. The successful synthesis of O3&#8208;NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2 marked a breakthrough, offering high capacity, moisture stability, and no voltage decay. Yet, issues such as irreversibility, voltage hysteresis, and slow kinetics remain. In this concept, we review the state of the art of this promising O3 phase with a brief account of other anionic&#8208;redox&#8208;based Na compounds. We then discuss strategies and prospects to address these challenges, including tuning chemical compositions, O/P multiphase structures, and superstructure ordering.

Supercapacitor Electrode: Litchi&#8208;skin&#8208;like morphology NiMoP2 microspheres loaded on MOF&#8208;derived carbon layers for enhancing the electrochemical performance of ASCs.








Abstract
Developing ideal positive electrodes with excellent performance and structural stability for supercapacitors is crucial in enhancing the application potential. Herein, we successfully fabricate a composite structure of NiMoP2@C on nickel foam (NF) (NMP@C/NF), which is formed by loading a litchi&#8208;skin&#8208;like morphology NiMoP2 microspheres onto MOF&#8208;derived carbon layer with the two&#8208;step electrodeposition method. The carbon layer acts as a structurally stable framework, and its synergistic effect with active materials suppresses volume expansion while enhancing electron transport efficiency. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous interface between crystalline/amorphous phases optimizes redox reaction kinetics, and the unique morphology composed of multi&#8208;scale components increases the accessible surface area for redox reactions. As a result, the NMP@C/NF obtains a high specific capacitance of 2224.8 F g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1, and the capacitance retention rate is 94.97% after 8000 cycles. The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) assembled with NMP@C/NF positive electrode and active carbon negative electrode generates an energy density of 52.52&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 784.55&#160;W kg&#8722;1, and its capacitance retention rate reaches up to 78% after 8000 cycles. This study provides promising pathway for the rational design of high&#8208;performance and environmentally friendly positive electrodes for supercapacitors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing ideal positive electrodes with excellent performance and structural stability for supercapacitors is crucial in enhancing the application potential. Herein, we successfully fabricate a composite structure of NiMoP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@C on nickel foam (NF) (NMP@C/NF), which is formed by loading a litchi-skin-like morphology NiMoP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; microspheres onto MOF-derived carbon layer with the two-step electrodeposition method. The carbon layer acts as a structurally stable framework, and its synergistic effect with active materials suppresses volume expansion while enhancing electron transport efficiency. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous interface between crystalline/amorphous phases optimizes redox reaction kinetics, and the unique morphology composed of multi-scale components increases the accessible surface area for redox reactions. As a result, the NMP@C/NF obtains a high specific capacitance of 2224.8 F g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and the capacitance retention rate is 94.97% after 8000 cycles. The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) assembled with NMP@C/NF positive electrode and active carbon negative electrode generates an energy density of 52.52&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a power density of 784.55&#160;W kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and its capacitance retention rate reaches up to 78% after 8000 cycles. This study provides promising pathway for the rational design of high-performance and environmentally friendly positive electrodes for supercapacitors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Differentiating Ligand Tailoring and Cation Incorporation as Strategies for Tuning Heterobimetallic Cerium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influences of ligand structure and incorporation of secondary Lewis acidic cations on high coordination number cerium centers have been studied, revealing unique roles for ligands and secondary cations in driving structural and electronic tunability. Tuning of redox&#8208;active complexes by secondary cations is an important strategy commonly applied to low coordination number metal centers but one that is underexplored for heavier metals like lanthanides (including cerium) and actinides.








Abstract
Tuning of redox&#8208;active complexes featuring metals with high coordination numbers by incorporation of secondary redox&#8208;inactive cations has received far less attention than it deserves. Here, appending moderate steric bulk to a tripodal ligand framework has been tested for its influence on secondary&#8208;cation&#8208;driven structural and electrochemical tuning of cerium, a lanthanide that tends to adopt high coordination numbers. A quasi&#8208;C3&#8208;symmetric cerium(III) complex denoted [Ce] has been prepared that features pendant benzyloxy groups, and this work demonstrates that this species offers a site capable of binding single Na+ or Ca2+ ions. Electrochemical and UV&#8208;visible spectroscopic studies reveal equilibrium binding affinity of [Ce] for Na+ in acetonitrile solvent, contrasting with tight binding of all cations in all other previously studied systems of this type. The modulated cation binding can be attributed to the bulky benzyloxy groups, which impact the thermodynamics of cation binding but do not impede the formation of cerium centers with coordination number 8 upon binding of either Na+ or Ca2+. The Ce(IV/III) reduction potential was found to be tunable under the equilibrium binding conditions, highlighting the potentially significant role that controlled structural changes can play in modulating the solution properties of heterobimetallic complexes.

3&#8208;Fucosyllactose human milk oligosaccharide was produced using a reliable chemical synthesis approach. Also reported is the first chemical synthesis of lacto&#8208;N&#8208;fucopentaose V human milk oligosaccharide. The approach for the synthesis of lacto&#8208;N&#8208;fucopentaose V comprised a convergent&#160;2 + 3 assembly strategy, making use of a trisaccharide building block derived from 3&#8208;fucosyllactose.








Abstract
Glycans present in human milk have been the focus of many studies due to challenges associated with their synthesis. The development of new methods for obtaining individual glycans found in human milk has been a vibrant area of research in glycosciences. This study reports the synthesis of two fucosylated glycans found in human milk, 3&#8208;fucosyllactose, which was previously synthesized by both chemical and enzymatic methods, and the first chemical synthesis of lacto&#8208;N&#8208;fucopentaose V. Screening different protecting and leaving groups, as well as optimizing the glycosylation reaction conditions helped us to achieve efficient assembly and deprotection of these two fucosylated human milk oligosaccharides in good yields.

         <title>Click Conjugates of Artificial Ribonucleases: Sequence Specific Cleavage with Multiple Turnover</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trisbenzimidazole catalyst was attached to central positions of DNA and DNA&#8208;LNA oligonucleotides. The resulting conjugates bind complementary RNA strands and cleave them with multiple turnover and substrate half&#8208;lives down to 3.5&#160;hours. Up to 98.8% of cleavage occurs in a single site. The reaction does not depend on metal ions and also runs in the presence of EDTA.








Abstract
The azido modified RNA cleaving catalyst 2 has been attached to oligonucleotides containing alkyne linkers in a central position. The resulting conjugates hybridize specifically with complementary RNA strands and cleave them with multiple substrate turnover. RNA half&#8208;lives are in the range of 6&#8211;7&#160;hours (pH 8, 37 &#176;C). Some well&#8208;placed locked nucleic acid (LNA) nucleotides can further increase substrate affinities and reaction rates significantly (t&#189; of 3.5&#160;hours, kobs&#160;=&#160;0.20 h&#8722;1). RNA cleavage does not require metal ions and runs equally well in the presence of EDTA. Fragments of precisely defined lengths are formed, well suited for subsequent analysis by mass spectrometry and related bioanalytical techniques.

         <dc:description>Here, we report a novel strategy for the first time: bench&#8208;stable N&#8208;sulfonyl imidazoliums were used as the robust and versatile coupling reagents and sulfonating reagents. Fast reactions of N&#8208;sulfonyl imidazoliums with carboxylic acids or phosphodiesters formed carboxylic acid&#8208;sulfonic acid mixed anhydrides and phosphosulfonic acid mixed anhydrides, respectively, and the subsequent treatments of the highly active intermediates with the corresponding nucleophilic partners in the presence of imidazoles at room temperature provided amides, dipeptides, carboxylic esters, carboxylic thioesters (almost without racemization during the formation of amides, dipeptides, esters, thioesters), phosphamides and phosphoesters in high to excellent yields. This kind of Nsulfonyl imidazolium as the coupling reagent was successfully applied in solid phase synthesis of a polypeptide containing 32 amino acid residues. This strategy was effectively extended to the construction of glycosides, and high steroselectivity and good yields were provided. In addition, reactions of N&#8208;sulfonyl imidazoliums with amines or alcohols afforded the corresponding sulfonamides and sulfonates in excellent yields. This study should provide a highly efficient, economical and practical strategy for construction of diverse molecules.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
This study focuses on the development of a Pt&#8208;decorated NiMo&#8208;based carbon&#8208;supported catalyst (Pt&#8208;NiMo/C) through a solvent evaporation and high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis method, which shows excellent performance in the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction with low overpotentials, high stability, and great potential for industrial&#8208;scale water electrolysis and energy conversion applications.








Abstract
In response to the urgent demand for sustainable hydrogen production under industrial high&#8208;current&#8208;density conditions, this study presents the development of a Pt&#8208;decorated NiMo&#8208;based carbon&#8208;supported catalyst (Pt&#8208;NiMo/C) for efficient alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The catalyst was synthesized via a solvent evaporation method followed by high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis, achieving uniform dispersion of Pt&#8208;NiMo nanoparticles on conductive carbon. Electrochemical evaluations revealed exceptional HER performance with ultralow overpotentials of 20 and 170&#160;mV versus RHE at current densities of 10 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8315;2, respectively, surpassing commercial Pt/C benchmarks. The Pt&#8208;NiMo catalyst demonstrated robust stability over 120 hours at 100&#160;mA cm&#8315;2, attributed to its hierarchical structure and synergistic electronic interactions between Pt and NiMo. The MEA configuration showcased stable electrochemical performance with a current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8315;2 at a cell voltage of 1.53&#160;V versus RHE, highlighting its potential for efficient energy conversion applications such as water electrolysis or fuel cells. These results underscore the catalyst's potential for industrial&#8208;scale water electrolysis, offering a cost&#8208;effective and durable solution for green hydrogen production.

&lt;p&gt;In response to the urgent demand for sustainable hydrogen production under industrial high-current-density conditions, this study presents the development of a Pt-decorated NiMo-based carbon-supported catalyst (Pt-NiMo/C) for efficient alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The catalyst was synthesized via a solvent evaporation method followed by high-temperature pyrolysis, achieving uniform dispersion of Pt-NiMo nanoparticles on conductive carbon. Electrochemical evaluations revealed exceptional HER performance with ultralow overpotentials of 20 and 170&#160;mV versus RHE at current densities of 10 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, surpassing commercial Pt/C benchmarks. The Pt-NiMo catalyst demonstrated robust stability over 120 hours at 100&#160;mA cm&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, attributed to its hierarchical structure and synergistic electronic interactions between Pt and NiMo. The MEA configuration showcased stable electrochemical performance with a current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a cell voltage of 1.53&#160;V versus RHE, highlighting its potential for efficient energy conversion applications such as water electrolysis or fuel cells. These results underscore the catalyst's potential for industrial-scale water electrolysis, offering a cost-effective and durable solution for green hydrogen production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Transformation of Bio&#8208;Based Furfural into &#947;&#8208;Valerolactone over SO3H&#8208;Functionalized P&#9472;O&#9472;Hf Hybrid Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SO3H&#8208;functionalized P&#8208;O&#8208;Hf hybrid catalyst GPCS&#8208;Hf(1:1.5) was constructed to be highly efficient for the direct upgrading of furfural (FF) to &#947;&#8208;valerolactone (GVL) in a high yield of 71%, involving multiple reaction steps, mainly attributed to an appropriate amount/distribution of Lewis acid&#8208;base (Hf4+&#8208;O2&#8722;) and Br&#248;nsted acid (H+) sites and favorable texture structure. Moreover, GPCS&#8208;Hf(1:1.5) was highly recyclable with intact multi&#8208;functional motifs.








Abstract
&#947;&#8208;Valerolactone (GVL) has great application potential in organic synthesis and biofuels, while its high&#8208;efficiency production from easily available bio&#8208;based feedstock is challenging. In this work, SO3H&#8208;functionalized P&#8208;O&#8208;Hf hybrid catalysts GPCS&#8208;Hf(n:m) were facilely prepared by solvothermal treatment of glucose&#8208;containing organic precursors (GPC) and Hf4+ in a mass ratio of n:m. The acid strength and Lewis/Br&#248;nsted acid sites of GPCS&#8208;Hf(n:m) could be modulated by tuning the GPC/Hf4+ ratio. Among them, GPCS&#8208;Hf(1:1.5) with appropriate acid&#8208;base properties delivered prominent catalytic activity in the direct upgrading of a bio&#8208;based bulk chemical furfural (FF) to GVL with a good yield of 71%, as optimized by response surface methodology. Especially, the suitable distribution of Lewis acid (Hf4+), Lewis base (O2&#8722;), and Br&#248;nsted acid (H+) sites played a synergistic role in cascade transfer hydrogenation, furan ring opening, second hydrogenation, and lactonization. Moreover, the GPCS&#8208;Hf(1:1.5) catalyst was unveiled to have a uniform elemental dispersion, relatively large specific surface area, and amorphous structure, which might also contribute to its superior efficiency. Recycling experiments showed that GPCS&#8208;Hf(1:1.5) could be reused at least six&#160;times with almost no decline in activity. The overall bio&#8208;derived catalytic conversion system offers a more sustainable manner for biomass valorization.

         <title>p&#8208;&#960; Conjugate Triggered Red Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Single Benzene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing the p&#8208;&#960; conjugation, single benzene derivatives, which are uniquely different from conventional extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems, display red/NIR RTP under ambient condition. One of the phosphors shows maximum RTP peak at 585&#160;nm, along with shoulder peaks at 545&#160;nm, 635&#160;nm, and 700&#160;nm. This architecture minimizes the requirement for red/NIR phosphors to a single benzene ring.








Abstract
Benzene is the simplest and the most basic building block for the construction of &#960; conjugated systems, which are widely used in various fields from fluorescent (FL) dyes to optoelectronic displays. However, achieving the red room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from single benzene is still challenging. Utilizing the p&#8208;&#960; conjugation, herein, we report a single benzene&#8208;based push&#8208;pull system with red RTP under ambient condition. One of the phosphors shows maximum RTP peak at 585&#160;nm, along with shoulder peaks at 545&#160;nm, 635&#160;nm, and 700&#160;nm. This architecture is uniquely separate from conventional extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems and minimizes the requirement for red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphors to a single benzene ring.

         <title>Photocatalysis Enables Chemodivergent Radical Polar Crossover: Ritter&#8208;Type Amidation vs Heck&#8208;Type Olefin Carbofunctionalizations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One aryl makes the difference: switching styrenes with 1,1&#8208;diaryl olefins as radical acceptors, the benzylic cation intermediate fate changes from Ritter&#8208;type carboamidation to Heck&#8208;type reaction. The decarboxylative photocatalytic chemodivergent methodology enabled broad scope and efficient scalability in both batch and flow. Mechanistic and computational studies demonstrated both radical generation pathways and the origin of product switchability. 








Abstract
Three&#8208;component alkene difunctionalization reactions constitute an ideal platform to rapidly build molecular complexity, enabling the simultaneous introduction of two distinct, orthogonal functional groups into the C&#9552;C bond in a single step. Herein, a photoredox catalyzed Ritter&#8208;type carboamidation of electronically diverse styrenes harnessing non&#8208;stabilized, nucleophilic primary radicals generated from readily&#8208;accessible carboxylic acid&#8208;derived redox active esters is reported. Furthermore, it is found that Heck&#8208;type products are chemoselectively obtained by simply switching aryl olefin acceptors with 1,1&#8208;diarylolefins. In the context of photocatalytic chemodivergent radical polar crossover, the synthesis of various trisubstituted alkenes was achieved, simultaneously revealing a divergence in the activation of redox&#8208;active esters toward reduction. In&#8208;depth mechanistic studies demonstrated both transformation pathways, while DFT calculations indicated the origin of product switchability. Both Ritter&#8208;type and Heck&#8208;type olefin carbofunctionalizations are scalable up to 4&#160;mmol scale in batch and continuous flow, proving the synthetic utility of the methodology.

         <title>Lewis&#8208;X&#8208;Containing Triterpenoid Saponins Inhibit DC&#8208;SIGN&#8208; and L&#8208;SIGN&#8208;Mediated Transfer of HIV&#8208;1 Infection</title>

The convergent synthesis of Lewis&#8208;X&#8208;containing betulinic acid and echinocystic acid saponins (1 and 2) is presented. The synthetic saponins were shown to inhibit, at the low micromolar range, the DC&#8208;SIGN&#8208; and L&#8208;SIGN&#8208;mediated transfer of HIV&#8208;1 infection to CD4&#8208;positive cells, whereas free Lewis&#8208;X, aglycones, and structurally similar triterpenoid saponins lacking the fucose residue were not.








Abstract
Blocking dendritic cell&#8208;specific intercellular adhesion molecule&#8208;3&#8208;grabbing nonintegrin (DC&#8208;SIGN)&#8208; and liver/lymph node&#8208;specific intercellular adhesion molecule&#8208;3&#8208;grabbing integrin (L&#8208;SIGN)&#8208;mediated human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV&#8208;1) attachment to immune cells represents a promising strategy for developing antiretroviral agents effective during the early stages of sexual transmission. Although mannose&#8208; and fucose&#8208;based ligands have received considerable attention, Lewis&#8208;based inhibitors remain relatively underexplored. In this study, we report the first synthesis of Lewis&#8208;X&#8208;containing triterpenoid saponins featuring betulinic acid and echinocystic acid as aglycones. These saponins were stereoselectively and efficiently synthesized in six linear steps using a convergent approach that leveraged thioglycoside and trichloroacetimidate glycosylation chemistries. Notably, our findings demonstrate that these Lewis&#8208;X&#8208;containing triterpenoid saponins are among the most potent monovalent inhibitors reported to date of DC&#8208;SIGN&#8208; and L&#8208;SIGN&#8208;mediated transfer of HIV&#8208;1 infection to CD4&#8208;positive cells, with IC50&#160;values in the low micromolar range (21&#8211;50 &#181;M). This work lays a valuable foundation for the development of saponin&#8208;based antiviral agents targeting immune cells.

         <title>Efficient and Selective Transformations of &#945;&#8208;Keto Esters into &#945;&#8208;Arylated &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Esters Using Continuous&#8208;Flow System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemoselective nucleophilic addition of aryllithium reagents to the keto&#8208;carbonyl moiety in &#945;&#8208;keto esters as ambident carbonyl electrophiles has been achieved by using flash continuous&#8208;flow system that has overcome the problems in the conventional batch reaction system. One or multiple competitive ester moieties remained intact despite the high reactivities of aryllithium reagents including the short&#8208;lived functionalized species that cannot survive in the batch reaction system. 








Abstract
This research explores the selective reactions of organolithium reagents with &#945;&#8208;keto esters using a flow microreactor system. The study highlights the influence of precise temperature control and rapid mixing on enhancing reaction yield and selectivity. By optimizing conditions for aryllithium reagents bearing electrophilic functional groups and &#945;&#8208;keto esters, the system demonstrated superior performance over traditional batch methods. This method efficiently minimized byproduct formation, providing high yields and excellent selectivity for sterically hindered substrates. The flow microreactor thus offers an innovative platform for complex organometallic transformations.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed C&#9472;H Oxidation of Alkanes and Postfunctionalization of Polyolefin Elastomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functionalization of polyolefin elastomer (POE) was achieved through the activation of C&#9472;H bonds in the polymer backbone using a cobalt catalyst and cumene hydroperoxide as an oxidant. This transformation enabled the introduction of polar functional groups, including alcohol, ketone, and ester moieties, into the POE structure.








Abstract
This study focuses on the postfunctionalization of polyolefin elastomers (POEs) through direct C&#9472;H activation using a novel cobalt&#8208;based catalytic system. The investigation, initiated with the oxidation of cyclohexane, identified the cumene hydroperoxide (CumHPO) as the optimal oxidant and ligands L3, L4, and L7 as effective in chlorinated benzene solvents. Cobalt catalyst (Cat. 1) demonstrated superior activity in the oxidation of octadecane, achieving a 42% yield with a minimal amount of catalyst. The catalytic system was successfully extended to the C&#9472;H oxidation of POE, introducing functional groups in solvents like 1,2&#8208;Cl2C6H4 and 1,2,4&#8208;Cl3C6H3. Our findings propose a simple and green approach for the postfunctionalization of POE, offering versatility and potential for broader applications in the field of polymeric compounds.

         <title>Minisci Reaction by an MW&#8208;Boost: A Simple Protocol for Site&#8208;Selective Dehydrogenative Cross&#8208;Coupling Between Nitrogen&#8208;Aromatics and C(sp3)&#9472;H Bonds</title>

         <dc:description>
The Minisci&#8208;type cross&#8208;coupling reaction between C&#9472;(sp3)&#9472;H bonds and nitrogen&#8208;containing aromatics proceeded successfully using a simple protocol based on MW (microwave) irradiation with a persulfate anion. The MW/PS protocol is applicable to a wide variety of dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling leading to the formation of alkylated heteroaromatics, in which the site&#8208;selectivity is ensured by a HAT transition state with a sulfate radical. The MW/persulfate protocol was applicable to direct intramolecular cyclization to give five and six&#8208;membered ring fused lutidine derivatives.








Abstract
The Minisci&#8208;type reaction between C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds and nitrogen&#8208;containing aromatics was carried out using a simple protocol based on the persulfate anion (PS) under microwave (MW) irradiation. The MW/PS protocol is applicable to a wide variety of dehydrogenative coupling reactions of N&#8208;heteroaromatics and C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds, leading to the formation of alkylated heteroaromatics. Site&#8208;selectivity is ensured by hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) with the sulfate radical affecting the polar/steric effects in the transition state. The MW/PS protocol was applicable to direct intramolecular cyclization to give five and six&#8208;membered rings fused by pyridine and lutidine, which, in previous methods, it was necessary to use tedious derivatization to imino&#8208;oxyacetic acids as HAT precursors.

         <title>Advances in Mechanochemical Methods for One&#8208;Pot Multistep Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochemical synthesis has emerged as a powerful and more sustainable alternative to conventional solution&#8208;based methods, offering advantages such as no or only minimal solvent use, reduced reaction times, and simplified operational conditions. The integration of multiple steps into a single reaction vessel further enhances these benefits by eliminating workup and purification steps, reducing waste, and often improving overall efficiency. This review highlights recent advancements in mechanochemical one&#8208;pot multistep reactions in organic synthesis, focusing on protocols with sequential one&#8208;pot operation. Diverse transformations are covered, including heterocycle formation, functional group interconversions, and the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients, while discussing both the operational and environmental advantages of these methodologies, along with their remaining challenges. Overall, mechanochemical one&#8208;pot synthesis has the potential to streamline transformations and therefore contribute to more sustainable approaches in modern organic synthetic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Exploration of Stereoelectronic Relationships in Manganese&#8208;Catalysed Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stereoelectronic effects governing Mn&#8208;catalysed hydrogenation reactions have been deconvoluted through the analysis of a series of in silico catalyst modifications using DFT (PBE0&#8208;D3PCM(EtOH)/def2&#8208;TZVP//RI&#8208;BP86PCM(EtOH)/def2&#8208;SVP level of theory). Computations were performed on the Mn&#8208;catalysed reduction of indanone based on a catalyst from the Clarke group, consisting of a tridentate ligand with pyridine, amine and phosphine donors and a ferrocenyl linker in the backbone. Enantioselectivity enhancements were found through two pathways; firstly, with the stabilisation of aromatic substrates by means of an extended &#960;&#8208;system, enhancing &#960;&#8208;stacking non&#8208;covalent interactions; secondly, by the introduction of steric bulk around the active site to destabilise one of the diastereomeric hydride transfer transition states. Electronic effects were differentiated from sterics by modification of the phenyl groups at the phosphine, trans&#8208; to the metal&#8208;hydride bond. While electron&#8208;withdrawing groups increased the thermodynamic driving force, the highest activity is predicted with electron&#8208;donating groups due to the improved basicity of the nitrogen lone pair, required for the initiation of hydrogen activation. Based on these observations, promising routes for synthetic catalyst design may involve donating groups which improve activity, coupled with enantiodiscrimination via steric bulk as a more general strategy than being limited to &#960;&#8208;containing substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereodynamism in chiral polyaromatic phosphepines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the present experimental&#8208;computational study, we demonstrate that the stereodynamism of phosphahelicenoid can be used to afford diastereoisomers of polyaromatics fused with a chiral phosphepine (7&#8208;membered P&#8208;ring). In particular, we highlight a complex interplay between the inversion at the P centre and helicenoid epimerization as well as a competition with a re&#8208;aromatization reaction. The impact of the conformational modifications on the structure and the chiroptical properties including circularly polarized luminescence are also discussed in detail.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymerase Synthesis of Hypermodified DNA Displaying a Combination of Thiol, Hydroxyl, Carboxylate and Imidazole Functional Groups in the Major Groove</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We designed and synthesized a set of six 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;triphosphates (dNTPs) bearing functional groups mimicking amino acid side chains in enzyme active sites (OH, SH, COOH and imidazole) attached to position 5 of pyrimidines or position 7 of 7&#8208;deazapurines through different linkers. These modified dNTPs were studied as substrates in enzymatic synthesis of modified and hypermodified DNA using several DNA polymerases. In primer extension (PEX), all modified dNTPs provided DNA containing one, two, three, or (all) four modified nucleotides each bearing a different modification, although the thiol&#8208;modified dNTPs were worse substrates compared to the others. In PCR, we observed exponential amplification for any combination of one, two or three non&#8208;sulfur dNTPs but the thiol&#8208;modified dNTP did not work well in any combinations. Sequencing of the hypermodified DNA confirmed the good fidelity of the incorporation of all the modified nucleotides. This set of modified dNTPs extends the portfolio of building blocks for prospective use in selections of functional nucleic acids.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Three new dinuclear complexes [CuCl(o&#8208;van&#8208;en)Ln(H2O)3 Cl]Cl&#183;C2H6O (Ln = Sm (1), Eu (2), Gd (3); H2(o&#8208;van&#8208;en) is the Schiff base formed by 2/1 condensation of o&#8208;vanillin and ethylenediamine) were prepared in single crystal form by the method of horizontal diffusion. The prepared complexes were characterized by chemical analyses and IR spectroscopy. The three complexes are isostructural and the Cu(II) is situated in the smaller cavities while the larger cavities accommodate larger Ln(III) atoms. The pentacoordination of the Cu(II) atoms is completed by a chlorido ligand in the apical position, while the octacoordination of the Ln(III) atoms is achieved by three additional aqua and one chlorido co&#8208;ligands. AC susceptibility studies have shown that complexes 2 and 3 exhibit field supported slow magnetic relaxation while the complex 1 does not display AC activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Dextran&#8208;Assisted Biomimetic Fabrication of CdSe:Eu QDs with Enhanced Biocompatibility and Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A dextran templated biomimetic synthetic approach was applied for the preparation of CdSe:Eu QDs. The present work examines synthetic variables including the effect of increasing Europium concentration during QDs&#8217; synthesis and the use of different coating agents (citrate versus APTES) to improve the QDs' colloidal stability and ameliorate their cytotoxic behaviour. All samples were subjected to structural and morphological characterizations via Fourier Transform infrared (FT&#8208;IR) spectroscopy, UV&#8211;Visible (UV&#8208;Vis) spectrophotometry, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). Subsequently, biological evaluation of all the synthesized samples of bare and APTES coated CdSe:Eu QDs was conducted on epithelial HaCaT and breast cancer MCF&#8208;7. The effect of the samples on cellular proliferation and migration was assessed through the wound healing assay. Finally, cellular localization of QDs was examined by fluorescence microscopy by exploiting their inherent fluorescent capability after excitation, thus validating their potential for cellular imaging and theragnostic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Heterometallic [LnIII2CoII5] Clusters: Magnetic Properties and Efffcient Conversion of CO2 with Epoxides and Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three heterometallic [LnIII2CoII5] clusters with the formulas [LnIII2CoII5(L1)2(L2)2(L3)2(OAc)4(NO3)2]&#183;4CH3CN (LnIII = Gd (1), Tb (2), and Dy (3); HL1 = (E)&#8208;1&#8208;((2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;methoxybenzylidene)amino)naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol, HL2 = 1&#8208;aminonaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol, and HL3 = trimethylopropane) have been obtained via self&#8208;assembly of mixed ligands strategy. Signi&#64257;cantly, cluster 1 displays a larger magnetocaloric effect (MCE) (&#8722;&#916;Sm = 36.83 J kg&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at 2.0 K and 7.0 T), while cluster 3 shows slow magnetic relaxation behavior under zero dc field. Moreover, clusters 1&#8208;3 as heterogeneous catalysts can effectively convert CO2 with epoxides and benzylamine to form oxazolidinones under mild conditions. To our knowledge, it is the first reported bifunctional heterometallic heptanuclear clusters which show well magnetic behaviors and can effectively catalyze CO2 with epoxides and amines under mild conditions simultaneously.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Isocoumarins via Light&#8208;Driven Carboxylative Cyclization Reaction of&#160;o&#8208;Ethynyl Aryl Bromides with CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isocoumarins are an important class of bicyclic lactones, which are seen in natural products, drugs, and bioactive compounds, and a variety of synthetic methods of isocoumarins have been developed. However, the&#160;synthesis of&#160;isocoumarins via the catalytic CO2&#160;fixation has been scarcely reported despite the potential incorporation of CO2&#160;into the lactone moiety. Here, we developed the&#160;light&#8208;driven carboxylative cyclization reaction of&#160;o&#8208;ethynyl aryl bromides&#160;with CO2, which&#160;selectively&#160;produced&#160;isocoumarins.&#160;Control experiments revealed that photoirradiation promoted the cyclization process with&#160;high&#160;selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion Exchange Polyelectrolytes with High Branching Ratio and Adjustable Free Volume for Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational design of polyelectrolytes that simultaneously meets the requirements for anion exchange membrane (AEM) and ionomer (AEI), especially the opposite gas permeation demands for anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) with similar chemical structure is challenging. To overcome the formation of insoluble gel at high branching ratio (BR), herein, a series of anion exchange polyelectrolytes of intrinsic microporosity with wide&#8208;ranged fractional free volume and good solubility at high BR are fabricated through a stepwise nonstoichiometric superacid&#8208;catalyzed polycondensation reaction. By precisely controlling the BR and free volume, a stable and porosity&#8208;adjustable structure is generated which not only addresses the conductivity&#8208;toughness trade&#8208;off of AEM, but also possesses high OH&#8208; conductivity for AEI. Most importantly, it fulfills the opposite gas permeation demands for AEM and AEI, and decreases the overpotentials of ohmic polarization and mass transport by 76.2% and 44.2%, respectively. The membrane electrode assembly fabricated by the optimized AEM and AEI achieves 1.98 V (pure water) and 1.62 V (1M KOH) at 1 A cm&#8208;2 with high stability. This work provides a strategy for rational design of polyelectrolytes that meets the requirements of AEM and AEI for high&#8208;performance AEMWE.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Amination of Peptides on the Solid Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Late&#8208;stage peptide modification is a powerful tool for rapidly generating a library of peptide mimetics e.g. for drug discovery or catalyst development. While late&#8208;stage modifications exist for many types of structural features, methods for introducing amines into peptides via a late&#8208;stage approach are rare, despite their enormous potential for the development of peptide therapeutics. Here we present a protocol for introducing amines into peptides by our established on&#8208;resin iodination&#8208;substitution approach. Our method is compatible with a wide variety of amines, including primary and secondary amines, anilines and other heteroaromatic N&#8208;nucleophiles mostly giving good to excellent yields. We introduce amines that are pharmacologically relevant as well as those that can impart catalytic or metal binding properties into the peptide of interest. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we introduce the metal ligand tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine (tren) into a tryptophan zipper scaffold using our late&#8208;stage amination approach to explore metal&#8208;induced stapling. Indeed, metal complexation via the tren ligand resulted in a thermal stabilization of more than 30 K in one of our tryptophan zipper designs.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Polyoxometalate&#8210;Metal Nanocluster Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
POMs are gaining attention in metal nanocluster synthesis for their ability to impart unique structural and functional roles. This review highlights recent advances in POM&#8211;metal nanocluster hybrids, categorized as follows: (a) hybrids of POMs and metal nanoclusters stabilized by organic ligands, (b) metal nanoclusters stabilized by POMs as ligands, and (c) solid&#8208;state synthesis of metal nanoclusters using POM&#8208;defined scaffolds.








Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are structurally well&#8208;defined anionic metal&#8211;oxo clusters with diverse structural forms and distinctive physicochemical properties, including acidity/basicity, redox activity, and optical behavior. Over the past two decades, POMs have garnered increasing attention in metal nanocluster synthesis owing to their ability to impart unique structural and functional characteristics to these compounds. Initially, research in this field primarily focused on hybrid materials composed of POMs and metal nanoclusters stabilized by organic ligands. However, more recently, studies have demonstrated that POMs can themselves act as effective stabilizing ligands for the synthesis of atomically precise metal nanoclusters. These POM&#8208;stabilized metal nanoclusters exhibit synergistic and cooperative properties of metal nanocluster and POM components, enabling novel applications in fields such as catalysis, photochemistry, sensing, and electrochemistry. Notably, recent investigations into POM&#8211;metal nanocluster hybrids have demonstrated their potential as atomically precise counterparts to metal nanoparticle catalysts supported on bulk metal oxides, exhibiting the unique cooperative catalysis. This review provides a concise overview of POM&#8210;metal nanocluster hybrids, with an emphasis on recent advancements in synthetic methodologies, properties, and applications. Additionally, solid&#8208;state synthetic strategies leveraging the rigid structures and redox properties of POMs for the controlled formation of metal nanoclusters are discussed.

         <title>Xanthochrysanthones A&#8722;C, Novel Lobster&#8208;Shape Cinnamoyltriketone Dimers with Antiviral Activities from Xanthostemon chrysanthus</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three pairs of novel enantiomeric cinnamoyltriketone dimers (1&#8722;3) with unprecedented spiro[cyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8242;&#8208;xanthene] or benzo[7,8]oxocino[4,5&#8208;b]chromene tetracyclic ring systems were isolated from Xanthostemon chrysanthus via a building blocks&#8208;based molecular network (BBMN) strategy.








Abstract
Three pairs of enantiomeric cinnamoyltriketone dimers, (+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;xanthochrysanthones A&#8722;C [(+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;1&#8211;3)], were recognized and obtained from Xanthostemon chrysanthus by employing the building blocks&#8208;based molecular network (BBMN) strategy. Compounds 1&#8211;3 featured two new types of lobster&#8208;shape carbon skeletons with unprecedented spiro[cyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8242;&#8208;xanthene] or benzo[7,8]oxocino[4,5&#8208;b]chromene tetracyclic ring systems. Their structures with absolute configurations were established by comprehensive spectroscopic analyses, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and ECD calculations. Compounds 1&#8211;3 represent the first example of phloroglucinol derivatives that are biogenetically constructed by a De Mayo reaction followed by Michael addition. Additionally, compounds 1&#8211;3 exhibited significant antiviral activity against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Time&#8208;of&#8208;addition assays indicated that compound 3 specifically acts on the early stages of the virus replication process in RSV.

         <title>The vicinal&#8208;d iiodination of the HDDA&#8208;benzynes by N&#8208;Iodo&#8208; succinimide (NIS) through a radical pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 1,2&#8208;diradical reactivity of the HDDA&#8208;benzynes (thermal) has not been explored well in comparison to their ionic reactivity. Accordingly, the radical trapping reactions of these reactive intermediates are very scarce in literature. Here in we report the iodine&#8208;radical trapping reaction of the HDDA&#8208;benzynes for the construction of structurally divergent vicinal&#8208;diiodo arenes. The N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NIS) has been employed as the source of radical iodine under thermal heating conditions. The existence of the arene&#8208;radical intermediates and the radical mechanism has been supported by the EPR spectral analysis of the reaction mixture. Several fruitful control experiments suggested that the 4&#8208;iodination (mono&#8208;) of the HDDA&#8208;benzynes is faster than the 5&#8208;iodiniation. The process is general in terms of substituents on the diynes as well as the nature of the tethering units. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report on the vicinal&#8208;diiodination as well as radical diiodination of HDDA&#8208;benzynes.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal/Metal Sulfide Heterostructures Boost Energy&#8208;Saving Hydrogen Production Coupled with Sulfion Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen production through the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) provides a promising pathway for sustainable and green energy. Coupling HER with the thermodynamically favorable sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR) can reduce energy consumption and recycle industrial by&#8208;product S2&#8722;. However, the development and practical application are hindered by the lack of cost&#8208;effective and robust catalysts. Herein, we constructed a bifunctional electrode with rich metal/metal sulfide heterostructures using NiFe foam through stepwise electrodeposition and hydrothermal sulfurization (NiFe&#8208;CrCoMo&#8208;S). Benefiting from the hydrophilic and sulfur&#8208;repellent surface and rich metal/metal sulfide heterostructures, it delivers outstanding SOR and HER performance. The integrated cell, utilizing the NiFe&#8208;CrCoMo&#8208;S electrode for both the cathode and anode, achieves a remarkable cell voltage of 0.75 V at a current density of 200 mA cm&#8722;2, which is 1.43 V lower than conventional water electrolysis. It demonstrates extraordinary long&#8208;term durability over 1100 hours without significant decay, achieving high Faradaic efficiencies (&#8805;99%) and low electricity consumption (1.79 kWh m&#8722;3 H2) for hydrogen production. This work paves the way for environmentally friendly strategies, combining cost&#8208;effective hydrogen production with value&#8208;added sulfur recovery, offering a reliable option for bifunctional catalyst design.</dc:description>

         <title>Impacts of Chalcogen Bonding on the Stability and Reactivity of 5&#8208;Iminothianthrene Platform: Toward Electrophilic Nitrogen Sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The thianthrene scaffold has recently attracted significant attention in various coupling reactions. Although 5&#8208;iminothianthrene and its derivatives are expected to function as electrophilic aminating reagents, their properties and reactivity have not been fully investigated. In this work, it was found that 5&#8208;iminothianthrene reacted with various electrophiles, such as acid chlorides, protons, and isothiocyanates to give the corresponding adducts. In addition, intramolecular chalcogen bonding (ChB) was identified in those adducts, and this interaction was found to contribute to their stability and reactivity.

Although 5-iminothianthrene and its derivatives are expected to function as electrophilic aminating reagents, their properties and reactivity have not been fully investigated. In this work, it was found that 5-iminothianthrene reacted with various electrophiles, such as acid chlorides, protons, and isothiocyanates to give the corresponding adducts. In addition, intramolecular chalcogen bonding (ChB) was identified in those adducts, and this interaction was found to contribute to their stability and reactivity. Finally, the potential of N-acyliminothianthrenes as N-acylnitrene equivalents were demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hybrid Cyclopeptide&#8208;Based Chemical Models for Allosteric Disulfide and Amyloid Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present here a series of isomeric disulfide&#8208;based hybrid cyclic peptides with different ring sizes. The water soluble pseudopeptidic macrocycles display a high intrinsic tendency to self&#8208;assemble. Microscopic investigations revealed amyloid like fibrillar morphology with autofluorescence. X&#8208;ray crystal structure of 23&#8208;membered macrocycle showed the presence of intra molecular hydrogen bonding and a unique S&#183;&#183;&#183;O interaction. We delineate that the macrocyclic framework is an ideal platform to generate various classes of disulfide conformations. X&#8208;ray structure of the macrocycle further revealed the presence of an allosteric disulfide bond with &#8208;LHHook geometry.</dc:description>

         <title>Binuclear Lanthanide Complexes as Magnetic Resonance and Optical Imaging Probes for Redox Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binuclear lanthanide complexes bearing nitrophenol, azophenol and azide chromophores can be reduced to the amine, giving rise to dramatic changes in the luminescence behavior. Such reductions can be achieved using enzymes as well as by chemical means. The tunable redox response and imaging modalities of these versatile complexes have the potential to open up new approaches to redox sensing.








Abstract
We report a family of lanthanide(III) complexes that act as redox probes via both magnetic resonance (MR) and luminescence outputs. The ligands are functionalized with nitro, azobenzene and azide groups which are reduced to a common aniline product, and each responds to both chemical and biocatalytic reductive conditions at different cathodic onset potentials. By judicious choice of complexed Ln(III), the probes can be optimized either for use in MR imaging (Ln&#160;=&#160;Gd), or as highly efficient turn&#8208;on luminescence probes (Ln&#160;=&#160;Tb). The Tb(III) analogues are essentially nonemissive, until reductive generation of the aniline affords a complex which when excited by visible light (488&#160;nm) emits green light with a quantum yield of 45% and millisecond long luminescent lifetimes (ms). The tunable redox response and imaging modalities of these versatile complexes have the potential to open up new approaches to redox sensing, such as the imaging of hypoxic environments in biology.

         <title>Localized Breakdown of the Niobium Anodic Oxide Film by Bromides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bromide&#8208;induced localized breakdown of niobium anodic oxide films&#160;depends on the bromide concentration and potential scan rate. Related experimental relationships agree with the predictions of a point defect model (PDM) under certain conditions. Within the same potential region, niobium maintains passivity in the more aggressive chloride media. PDM is used to explain the bromide&#8208;induced localized corrosion of niobium






.

Abstract
The growth of the anodic oxide passive film on Nb and its stability were studied in aqueous bromide media. Potentiodynamic polarization up to 12 VSCE showed that passive Nb loses its stability resulting in either metastable or stable pitting corrosion depending on the bromide concentration and the potential scan rate. On the contrary, Nb remains passive in the more aggressive chloride media where most passive metals and alloys are often susceptible to localized breakdown. This unusual bromide&#8208;induced localized breakdown of passive Nb occurs for bromide concentrations higher than 0.25&#160;M at a critical breakdown potential (Eb). Stable active dissolution in pits was observed at potentials higher than Eb. &#932;&#959; get an insight into the physicochemical processes responsible for the susceptibility of Nb to the bromide&#8208;induced localized corrosion, the oxide growth and its breakdown are discussed in terms of a point defect model (PDM). Experimental relationships between Eb and either the bromide activity or the potential scan rate agree with the PDM predictions. The bromide&#8208;induced localized breakdown of passive Nb seems to be associated with the absorption of bromides preferably on lattice anion vacancies at the oxide|electrolyte interface leading through a series of processes to vacancy condensation at the Nb|oxide interface.

         <title>Highly Emissive Hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;benzocoronene&#8208;fluoranthene Hybrid as Easily Processable and Stable OLED Material</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;symmetry&#8208;broken&#8221; hexabenzocoronene&#8208;fluoranthene fluorescent dye was synthesized using an easily scalable reaction. Green emission at around 500&#160;nm, a maximum photoluminescence quantum yield of 67% in toluene, and high solubility in a wide range of solvents result from the distorted structure. A green organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) was fabricated without extensive optimization showcasing easy processability of the molecule class.








Abstract
We report the synthesis of a fluorescent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon dye with a &#8220;symmetry&#8208;broken&#8221; core, derived from the related hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;benzocoronene (HBC) core with a fluoranthene subunit. The fluorophore is composed of a pure carbon skeleton without heteroatoms and exhibits remarkable photoluminescence properties with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of up to 67% in toluene, exceeding that of the parent HBC by a factor of 30. The single crystal X&#8208;ray structure reveals the distorted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon structure, which is responsible for the optoelectronic properties, as supported by density functional theory calculations. We show that the new fluorescent dye can be readily used for the fabrication of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLED) without extensive optimization, whereby solubility in a variety of solvents and successful film formation are decisive.

         <title>Excited State Branching Processes in a Ru(II)&#8208;Based Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8211;Donor System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoinduced electron transfer processes in a Ru(II)&#8208;based push&#8211;pull&#8211;push architecture which combines an inorganic and organic chromophore are elucidated in a joint spectroscopic&#8208;theoretical approach. The applied design concept allows the excited state to be localized away from the metal onto the organic chromophore.








Abstract
Excited state properties such as excitation energy, accessibility of the respective excited state either by direct or indirect population transfer, and its lifetime govern the application of these excited states in light&#8208;driven reactions, for example, photocatalysis using transition metal complexes. Compared with triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT) states, charge&#8208;separated (3CS) excited states involving organic moieties, such as triplet intra&#8208;ligand or ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3ILCT and 3LLCT) states, tend to possess longer&#8208;lived excited states due to the weak spin&#8208;orbit coupling with the closed&#8208;shell ground state. Thus, the combination of inorganic and organic chromophores enables isolating the triplet states onto the organic chromophore. In this study, we aim to elucidate the excited&#8208;state relaxation processes in a Ru(II)&#8208;terpyridyl donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor system (RuCl) in a joint spectroscopic&#8208;theoretical approach combining steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy as well as quantum chemical simulations and dissipative quantum dynamics. The electron transfer (ET) processes involving the low&#8208;lying 3MLCT, 3ILCT, and 3LLCT excited states were investigated experimentally and computationally within a semiclassical Marcus picture. Finally, dissipative quantum dynamical simulations&#8212;capable of describing incomplete ET processes involving all three states&#8212;enabled us to unravel the competitive relaxation channels at short and long timescales among the strongly coupled 3MLCT&#8208;3ILCT states and weakly coupled 3MLCT&#8208;3LLCT and 3ILCT&#8208;3LLCT states.

Finally, dissipative quantum dynamical simulations&#8212;capable of describing incomplete ET processes involving all three states&#8212;enabled us to unravel the competitive relaxation channels at short and long timescales among the strongly coupled &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;MLCT-&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;ILCT states and weakly coupled &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;MLCT-&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;LLCT and &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;ILCT-&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;LLCT states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tumor Suppression by Targeting Senescent Cells with a Selective Singlet Oxygen Releasing Endoperoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#946;&#8208;Galactosidase&#8208;triggered release of singlet oxygen is shown to target and selectively eliminate senescent cells. In addition, data obtained using tumor models reveal a significant suppression of tumor progression by targeted singlet oxygen release.








Abstract
Targeting senescent cells for cancer treatment is an important recent direction. In this work, we designed and synthesized a galactoside&#8208;functionalized pyridone endoperoxide. The endoperoxide in this form, releases singlet oxygen at a relatively slow rate, but when transformed by &#946;&#8208;galactosidase activity, the pyridone endoperoxide releases singlet oxygen with a half&#8208;life of 30 minutes at 37 &#176;C. We also studied this compound with a variety of cell lines with differential &#946;&#8208;galactosidase expression levels. Cytotoxicity of the target compound is enhanced in high galactosidase&#8208;expressing SKOV&#8208;3 cells. In vivo tests with tumor models also showed significant suppression of tumor progression. Targeting singlet oxygen to senescent cells appears to be promising new approach for treating diseases concurrent with aging, including cancer.

         <title>Toward Symmetric Organic Aqueous Flow Batteries: Triarylamine&#8208;Based Bipolar Molecules and Their Characterization via an Extended Kouteck&#253;&#8211;Levich Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bipolar redox&#8208;active organic molecules based on a triarylamine skeleton and a viologen unit for pH&#8208;neutral aqueous flow batteries are presented. Cyclic voltammetry shows that only viologen with a highly hydrophilic substituent, connected to the TAA moiety can be reversibly reduced. A modified Kouteck&#253;&#8211;Levich analysis is presented to investigate the observed potential&#8208;dependent currents at the hydrodynamically dominated region.








Abstract
Symmetric organic flow batteries (SOFBs) can potentially address membrane crossover problems by employing bipolar redox&#8208;active organic molecules (BROMs). Herein, a triarylamine (TAA) skeleton was chosen as a posolyte moiety for a new class of bipolar molecules for pH&#8208;neutral aqueous flow batteries (FBs). Pyridinium and viologen derivatives were tethered to the posolyte moiety, and the new compounds were characterized. Cyclic voltammetry revealed that only viologen with a highly hydrophilic substituent, connected to the TAA moiety via a Zincke reaction, could be reversibly reduced. Varying the supporting electrolyte concentration on the selected derivative revealed water solubility as a challenge for further development. The selected derivative, MeO&#8208;TPA&#8208;Vi&#8208;DMAE, was subjected to hydrodynamic voltammetry, and a modified Kouteck&#253;&#8211;Levich analysis was developed to investigate the observed potential&#8208;dependent currents at the hydrodynamically dominated region, which are often seen with redox&#8208;active organic molecules. This model discarded a purely Ohmic effect, showing a useful Levich slope at a certain overpotential before the onset of a secondary reaction. TAA&#8208;based BROMs hold promise for pH&#8208;neutral aqueous SOFBs, and the results will guide the design of new derivatives. The three&#8208;term Kouteck&#253;&#8211;Levich relation here introduced will be useful not only to develop BROM&#8208;based FBs but will most likely appeal to a much broader audience.

         <title>Dense Li Deposition and Enhanced Flame&#8208;retardant Enabled by Localized Strong Ion&#8208;Dipole Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully designed a localized strong ion&#8208;dipole interactions&#8208;based electrolyte with solvation structure involving dual anions. The electrolyte not only exhibits excellent flame retardancy, but also forms a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) for dense Li deposition, which significantly improves the cycling life of Li metal batteries.








Abstract
Uncontrolled lithium (Li) deposition can lead to the formation of dendrites and &#8220;dead&#8221; Li, accelerating the degradation of cycling stability and safety performance in lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, we propose a strategy to achieve dense Li deposition and flame&#8208;retardant by designing an electrolyte based on localized strong ion&#8208;dipole (LSID) interactions. The strong ion&#8208;dipole interactions between the multiple&#8208;dipole solvent (G4), NO3&#8722;, FSI&#8722;, and Li+ promote the formation of Li+ primary solvation sheaths for stabilizing Li deposition behavior. While the weak dipole fluorine&#8208;containing diluent (TTE) is distributed in the secondary solvation sheath due to weak ion&#8208;dipole interactions of Li+&#8208;TTE to improve interfacial wettability and flame retardancy due to preferential separation. Consequently, the localized strong ion&#8208;dipole interactions strategy in the designed electrolyte successfully achieves a Coulombic efficiency of more than 99% for Li||Cu cells, and ultrathin Li&#8208;matched Li||LFP and Li||NCM523 cells also demonstrate excellent cycling stability, as well as an improved safety performance of LMBs.

ML accelerates sustainable polymer development by replacing resource&#8208;extensive trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods with efficient predictive modeling for catalyst discovery, polymer property optimization and new material design.








Abstract
Sustainable polymers from renewable resources have been gaining importance due to their recyclability and reduced environmental impact. However, their development through conventional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods remains inefficient and resource&#8208;intensive. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in polymer science, enabling rapid prediction, and discovery of new chemicals and materials. In this review, we examine emerging trends in ML applications for sustainable polymer development, focusing on catalyst discovery, property optimization, and new polymer design. We analyze unique challenges in applying ML to sustainable polymers and evaluate proposed solutions, providing insights for future development in this rapidly evolving field.

         <title>Endohedral Coordination of Bulky Substrates in Metalloenzyme&#8208;Like Organometallic Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organometallic nanotube with eight CuI ions mimics metalloenzyme behavior, featuring a flexible pore, metal&#8208;ligand substrate binding, and redox&#8208;active metals. Insertion of THF as a model substrate is driven by coordination, as confirmed by SC&#8208;XRD, NMR, and DFT. Electrochemical studies of a derived rotaxane reveal metal&#8208;centered redox activity.

Abstract
Artificial receptors inspired by metalloenzymes share three key properties: a structurally flexible cavity, substrate binding via metal&#8208;ligand coordination, and metal&#8208;based redox activity. Herein, we report an organometallic nanotube with such features based on our supramolecular pillarplex platform, incorporating eight CuI centers in its cavitand walls. The structurally adaptable cavity of this receptor enables the endohedral coordination of tetrahydrofuran (THF) as a hydrophilic model substrate with remarkable binding affinity despite a steric mismatch between the host and guest. Evidence from SC&#8208;XRD, 1H NMR titration in aqueous solution, and DFT modelling confirms that metal&#8208;ligand coordination governs substrate binding. Electrochemical analysis of a derived rotaxane reveals metal&#8208;centered redox activity.

         <title>Click&#8208;Functionalized Cyanine Fluorogenic Dimers for Improved Detection of GPCRs: Application to Imaging of ApelinR in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A click&#8208;mediated functionalization of a cyanine 5.5 bearing a terminal alkyne gave a rapid access to a library of ten new cyanine dyes and their corresponding dimers. A structure&#8208;interaction relationship study led to the identification of an optimal dimer which was conjugated to the apelin&#8208;17 ligand and enabled imaging of ApelinR under no&#8208;wash conditions.








Abstract
Fluorogenic dimers enable background&#8208;free imaging of biological targets under wash&#8208;free conditions owing to a strong fluorescence enhancement in the apolar cell microenvironment. However, it is crucial that the imaging probe interacts solely with the target receptor to avoid nonspecific interactions and ensure detection with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. Herein, we describe a convenient and rapid approach for the synthesis of various functionalized cyanine dyes by click chemistry allowing the fine&#8208;tuning of the physicochemical and fluorogenic properties of the dimers. A structure&#8208;interaction relationship study was conducted for the fluorogenic dimers in the presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and liposomes as models of serum proteins and cell membranes. We identified d&#9472;Cy&#9472;E which combined the lowest nonspecific interactions with the optimal fluorescence turn&#8208;on properties. By conjugating d&#9472;Cy&#9472;E to a peptide ligand of the apelin GPCR, we developed Ap&#9472;d&#9472;Cy&#9472;E, the first fluorescent turn&#8208;on probe for the background&#8208;free imaging of this receptor in living cells.

         <title>Development of Water&#8208;Soluble 3&#8208;Nitro&#8208;2&#8208;Pyridinesulfenate for Disulfide Bond Formation of Peptide Under Aqueous Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly water&#8208;soluble Npy&#8208;sulfenate functions as an efficient oxidizing agent for the formation of disulfide bonds in thiol&#8208;containing peptides. The Npy&#8208;sulfenate can be used to form a disulfide bond with a thiol&#8208;containing peptide produced by thiol&#8208;additive&#8208;free NCL, thereby facilitating the one&#8208;pot synthesis of adrenomedullin. These results provide a new one&#8208;pot synthetic methodology for cyclic disulfide peptides based on sulfenate&#8208;mediated oxidation.








Abstract
Establishing an efficient method for the synthesis of disulfide bonds in peptides is an important challenge for the further development of several research fields, including peptide&#8208;based medicinal chemistry and biochemistry. Herein, we report the development of a novel highly water&#8208;soluble 3&#8208;nitro&#8208;2&#8208;pyridine (Npy) sulfenate that efficiently forms intramolecular disulfide bonds in reduced peptides. Moreover, Npy&#8208;sulfenate formed a disulfide bond in a thiol&#8208;containing peptide prepared by thiol&#8208;additive&#8208;free native chemical ligation (NCL), as demonstrated by the one&#8208;pot synthesis of adrenomedullin, which contains 52 amino acid residues. This study provides a new one&#8208;pot synthetic methodology for preparing mid&#8208;sized cyclic disulfide peptides via sulfenate&#8208;mediated oxidation.

         <title>Synthetic Studies on Enantioselective Total Syntheses of Tabercarpamines and Voacangine&#8208;Type Indole Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unified catalytic asymmetric total syntheses of (iso)voacangines, 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;(iso)voacangines, and (3S)&#8208;cyano(iso)voacangines were achieved for the first time. The syntheses hinged on a catalytic asymmetric Michael/aldol reaction for the construction of chiral aza&#8208;[3.3.1]&#8208;bridged bicyclic framework at the early stage and a ring reconstruction from [3.3.1]&#8208; to [2.2.2]&#8208;bicyclic ring system at the late stage.








Abstract
The proposed post&#8208;iboga natural products, (+)&#8208;tabercarpamines G and I, along with their corresponding C20 stereoisomers and C10&#8208;methoxy&#8208;regioisomers were synthesized. An extensive NMR spectroscopic study showed that the spectral data of these synthetic compounds were not consistent with the proposed (+)&#8208;tabercarpamines G and I in isolation report, indicating that the proposed structures were misassigned. Subsequently, from the advanced intermediates for the synthesis of the proposed (+)&#8208;tabercarpamines G and I, the unified enantioselective syntheses of six iboga&#8210;type natural products including (&#8208;)&#8208;isovoacangine and (&#8208;)&#8208;voacangine, (&#8208;)&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;isovoacangine and (&#8208;)&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;voacangine, and (&#8208;)&#8208;(3S)&#8208;cyanoisovoacangine and (&#8208;)&#8208;(3S)&#8208;cyanovoacangine were accomplished via a divergent manner. The synthetic route provided the first catalytic asymmetric approach to access these three types of iboga&#8210;type natural products and achieved the first enantioselective syntheses of (3S)&#8208;cyano(iso)voacangines. Our synthesis hinged on a catalytic asymmetric Michael/aldol reaction for the construction of chiral aza&#8208;[3.3.1]&#8208;bridged bicyclic framework at the early stage and a ring reorganization process from [3.3.1]&#8208; to [2.2.2]&#8208;bicyclic ring system&#8213;a pathway opposite to the proposed biogenic synthesis&#8213;at the late stage.

         <title>Oxidative Release of Natural Glycans (ORNG): Preparation of Truncated N&#8208;glycans for Engineering Glycoproteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we introduce a groundbreaking method of oxidative release of natural glycans (ORNG), enabling the efficient synthesis of mono&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) N&#8208;glycans. Leveraging this innovative approach, we generate a versatile library of truncated N&#8208;glycans and their oxazoline derivatives, facilitating the homogeneous glycosylation of monoclonal antibodies. Our results showcase the potential of ORNG in enhancing glycoprotein synthesis, offering substantial implications for biomedical research and therapeutic applications. Through detailed analysis and application, this work provides a foundation for future advancements in glycoengineering, aiming to overcome traditional barriers in glycan synthesis and functional exploration.








Abstract
N&#8208;glycosylation on asparagine is one of the most common post&#8208;translational modifications of proteins. The synthesis of homogeneous N&#8208;glycopeptides and glycoproteins is crucial for elucidating the concerted functions of glycans and peptides. Multiple endoglycosidase mutants have been developed to efficiently catalyze the coupling of oxazoline derivatives of N&#8208;glycans lacking the innermost N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) (mono&#8208;GlcNAc N&#8208;glycan) with peptide chains bearing a GlcNAcylated asparagine. However, the bottleneck for N&#8208;glycopeptide and glycoprotein synthesis remains access to these complex truncated N&#8208;glycan substrates in sufficient diversity and quantity. Here, we report a novel chemical method using modified oxidative release of natural glycans (ORNG) to produce a diverse library of mono&#8208;GlcNAc N&#8208;glycans and their oxazoline derivatives, paving the way for the facile synthesis of N&#8208;glycopeptides and glycoproteins. Using these substrates, homogeneous N&#8208;glycosylation of monoclonal antibodies can be efficiently achieved.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Application of Covalent Organic Framework &#8208; Based Ionic Conductors in Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), known for their tunable porosity and functional versatility, have demonstrated exceptional ionic conductivity in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). This review summarizes recent advancements in COF&#8208;based materials for PEMFC applications, emphasizing their roles as intrinsic proton conductors, host matrices for proton carriers, and additives in composite ionomers/membranes. Key strategies such as pore engineering, functional group modification, and hybrid designs with polymers are analyzed to highlight their influence on proton conductivity and mechanical stability. Recent developments reveal that functionalized COFs can achieve proton conductivities exceeding 0.89 S cm&#8210;1 at 90&#176;C under 100% relative humidity (RH), comparable to commercial Nafion membranes. Additionally, COF&#8208;modified ionomers applied to catalyst layers have enabled fuel cells to achieve peak power densities 1.6 times higher than those without COF incorporation. Despite these advancements, challenges persist in terms of membrane durability, scalability, and performance under low humidity or high&#8208;temperature conditions. Future research should prioritize structural optimization, interfacial compatibility, and cost&#8208;effective synthesis methods to fully realize the potential of COFs in next&#8208;generation PEMFCs. This review underscores the transformative potential of COFs in addressing the critical limitations of traditional proton&#8208;conducting materials, paving the way for innovative solutions in fuel cell technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategy&#8208;Level Prodrug Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic synthesis uniquely provides opportunities to access molecules that serve defined purposes. Medicinal chemistry illustrates this attribute well with prodrug design, whereby a drug undergoes a late&#8208;stage conversion to a conditionally responsive active medicinal agent (AMA), being a notable example. Prodrugs are becoming increasingly important in medicinal chemistry but common approaches to introduce biologically responsive groups are limited in the chemoselectivity and scope of available functionalization reactions. This Concept article describes strategy&#8208;level prodrug synthesis, which is a powerful extension of classical prodrug formation that initiates sequences with the objective of introducing functionality early in a sequence to achieve greater scope, site&#8208;selectivity, and chemoselectivity for the incorporation of the biologically responsive group. Examples of functionalization using alkyne hydroaminations, Curtius reaction, and alkene metathesis are highlighted along with the use of the prodrugs for biological applications.</dc:description>
