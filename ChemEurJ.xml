         <title>Ionomeric Binders for High Temperature Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (HT&#8208;PEMFC) based on phosphoric acid doped polybenzimidazole membrane (PBI/PA) operating at 120&#8208;200 &#176;C can provide insensitivity to carbon monoxide (CO) and simplified managements of water and heat and thus attract significant global attention. However, one signi&#64257;cant drawback is its low utilization of precious metal catalysts resulted from the PA poisoning and inefficient three&#8208;phase boundary. Studies of binder materials in catalyst layers for HT&#8208;PEMFC are gradually emerging and there are few literature reviews on this important topic. The purpose of this review is to describe the various types of binders based on their molecular structure and electrochemical properties, with particular emphasis on catalyst layer for fuel cells. Importantly, this review provides a better understanding of relationship between fuel cell performance and the gas permeability and conductivity of different binders. Then, future directions of research and development in binder materials of HT&#8208;PEMFC are pointed out.</dc:description>

         <title>Recovery of Berry Natural Products using Pyrene&#8208;based MOF Solid Phase Extraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work introduces a novel method of recovering bioactive berry natural products (BNPs) using solid phase extraction with metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF&#8208;SPE). Two pyrene&#8208;based MOFs with different structural topologies, Al&#8208;PyrMOF and Zr&#8208;NU&#8208;1000, were evaluated for their ability to capture and desorb BNPs, including ellagic acid, quercetin, gallic acid, and p&#8208;coumaric acid. Time&#8208;dependent BNP uptake via dispersive SPE revealed that NU&#8208;1000 outperformed Al&#8208;PyrMOF in capturing all BNPs. Our findings show NU&#8208;1000 demonstrated a higher and more consistent BNP capture profile, achieving over 90% capture of all BNPs within 36 hours, with only a 9% variation between the most and least effectively captured BNPs. In contrast, Al&#8208;PyrMOF, displayed a staggered uptake profile, with a significant 53% difference in capture efficiency between the most and least effectively captured BNP. However, when a BNP mixture was used at a loading concentration of 50 &#181;g/mL, Al&#8208;PyrMOF outperformed NU&#8208;1000, capturing over 70% of all BNPs. Al&#8208;PyrMOF also exhibited improved BNP recovery, with a minimum of two&#8208;fold greater amount recovered for all BNPs. Further testing with a BNP mixture at a concentration of 15 &#181;g/mL demonstrated that Al&#8208;PyrMOF efficiently concentrated all BNPs, achieving a maximum extraction factor of 2.71 observed for quercetin.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Switching of A Nano&#8208;Size Urea&#8208;bridged Zn(II)Porphyrin Dimer by External Stimuli</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For the first time, explicit stabilization of all the three conformers, viz. (cis,cis), (cis,trans) and (trans,trans), of a &#8216;nano&#8208;sized&#8217; highly&#8208;flexible urea&#8208;bridged Zn(II)porphyrin dimer have been achieved via careful manipulations of external stimuli such as solvent dielectrics, temperature, anionic interactions, axial ligation and surface&#8208;induced stabilization. The conformers differ widely in their structures, chemical and photophysical properties and thus have vast potential applicability. X&#8208;ray structural characterizations have been reported for the (cis,cis) and (cis,trans)&#8208;conformers. While (cis,cis) conformer stabilized exclusively in dichloromethane, more polar solvents resulted in the stabilization of (cis,trans) and (trans,trans)&#8208;conformers. Low temperature promotes the stabilization of (cis,trans)&#8208;conformer while rise in temperature facilitates flipping to the (cis,cis) one. Significantly, exclusive stabilization of the (trans,trans)&#8208;isomer has been illustrated using acetate anion which facilitates H&#8208;bonding with the two amide linkages of the urea spacer. Remarkably, HOPG surface facilitates stabilization of the energetically challenging (trans,trans)&#8208;conformer via CH&#183;&#183;&#183;p and p&#183;&#183;&#183;p interactions with the solid surface to the porphyrinic cores. DFT calculations demonstrate that the relative stability of the conformers can be modulated upon slight external perturbations as also observed in the experiment. Several factors contributing towards the conformational landscape for the highly flexible urea&#8208;bridged porphyrin dimers have been mapped.</dc:description>

         <title>Building 3D Crosslinked Graphene&#8208;MXene Nanoarchitectures Decorated with MoS2 Quantum Dots Enables Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust co&#8208;assembly method is developed to the bottom&#8208;up construction of 3D crosslinked graphene&#8208;MXene nanoarchitectures decorated with MoS2 quantum dots, which possess superior electrocatalytic properties towards the hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Although MoS2 quantum dots with abundant edge sites have been regarded as promising eletrode materials for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), their electrocatalytic capacity still requires improvements in actual applications. Herein. we demonstrate a controllable and robust bottom&#8208;up approach to build 3D crosslinked graphene&#8208;Ti3C2Tx MXene frameworks decorated with MoS2 quantum dots (MQD/RGO&#8208;MX) via a convenient co&#8208;assembly process. The novel structural design gives the MQD/RGO&#8208;MX nanoarchitectures a series of superior textural attributes, including 3D interconnected networks, continuous meso&#8208; and macropores, well&#8208;dispersed quantum dots, ameliorative electronic configuration, and excellent electrical conductivity. Accordingly, the resulting hybrid nanoarchitectures express superior electrocatalytic properties in terms of a low onset potential of only 45&#8197;mV, a small Tafel slope of 61&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 as well as a long service life towards the HER, which make it quite competitive against bare MoS2 quantum dots, MXene as well as binary MQD/RGO and MQD/MXene electrocatalysts.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Pyridylation of Alkynamides with Pyridylboronic Acids: A Route to Functionalized Enamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridylation of alkynamides with pyridylboronic acids under rhodium catalysis has been developed, providing a practical approach to the stereoselective synthesis of valuable alkenylpyridines with amide group using readily available reagents and a commercial catalyst. Further applications of pyridylation product from Weinreb amide to construct &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone and aldehyde were demonstrated, offering a practical route to synthesizing diverse functionalized alkenylpyridines.







Abstract
The catalytic direct hydroarylation of alkynamides is a highly efficient approach for accessing functionalized trisubstituted arylalkenes with amide groups. Herein, we report a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed pyridylation of alkynamides with pyridylboronic acids, producing a variety of primary, secondary, and tertiary enamides with high yields (up to 94&#8201;%). This reaction demonstrates broad tolerance towards various alkyl and aryl functional groups, providing convenient access to a diverse array of alkenylpyridine derivatives. To demonstrate potential applications in late&#8208;stage hydropyridylation, we synthesized &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones, aldehydes, and esters with high yields from the pyridylation product of Weinreb amides. This indirect expansion of the substrate scope enhances the practicality of this strategy. Additionally, the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone obtained can be further reduced to yield a chiral alcohol with a 99&#8201;% ee, further demonstrating the versatility and potential utility of this approach.

         <title>Concentration Controlling of Carboxylic Ester&#8208;Based Electrolyte for Low Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of moderate concentrations of LiDFOB and FEC has established a solid electrolyte interface rich in LiF. This effectively suppresses side reactions between the electrolyte and lithium metal and promotes the desolvation process of Li+. Li/LCO batteries using this electrolyte exhibit excellent long&#8208;term cycling performance even at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Low temperature has been a major challenge for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) to maintain satisfied electrochemical performance, and the main reason is the deactivation of electrolyte with the decreasing temperature. To address this point, in present work, we develop a low&#8208;temperature resistant electrolyte which includes ethyl acetate (EA) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as solvent and lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB) as the primary lithium salt. Due to the preferential decomposition of LiDFOB and FEC, a solid electrolyte interface rich in LiF is formed on the lithium metal anodes (LMAs) and lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) cathodes, contributing to higher stability and rapid desolvation of Li+ ions. The batteries with the optimized electrolyte can undergo cycling tests at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, with a capacity retention of 83.9&#8201;% after 200 cycles. Furthermore, the optimized electrolyte exhibits excellent compatibility with both LCO cathodes and graphite (Gr) anodes, enabling a Gr/LCO battery to maintain a capacity retention of 90.3&#8201;% after multiple cycles at &#8722;25&#8201;&#176;C. This work proposes a cost&#8208;effective electrolyte that can activate potential LIBs in practical scenarios, especially in low&#8208;temperature environments.

         <title>Carbon Dots in Photodynamic Therapy: The Role of Dopant and Solvent on Optical and Photo&#8208;Responsive Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to outstanding optical properties and biocompatibility, carbon dots (CDs) have been extensively gaining attention as a photo&#8208;responsive inducer for cancer photodynamic therapy. This review summarizes the synthesis and modification techniques of CDs that offer red&#8208;shift properties toward stronger fluorescence emission and deeper penetration of light&#8208;responsive reactive radical species generated at the laser&#8208;directing site that cause specific cell damage. The strategies summarized in this review could contribute to addressing the challenges in targeted cancer therapy.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) are novel carbon&#8208;based luminescent materials with wide&#8208;ranging applications in biosensing, bioimaging, drug transportation, optical devices, and beyond. Their advantageous attributes, including biocompatibility, biodegradability, antioxidant activity, photostability, small particle size (&lt;10&#8197;nm), and strong light absorption and excitation across a broad range of wavelengths, making them promising candidates in the field of photodynamic therapy (PDT) as photosensitizers (PSs). Further enhancements in functionality are imperative to enhance the effectiveness of CDs in PDT applications, notwithstanding their inherent benefits. Recently, doping agents and solvents have been demonstrated to improve CDs&#8217; optical properties, solubility, cytotoxicity, and organelle targeting efficiency. These improvements result from modifications to the CDs&#8217; carbon skeleton matrices, functional groups on the surface state, and chemical structures. This review discusses the modification of CDs with heteroatom dopants, dye dopants, and solvents to improve their physicochemical and optical properties for PDT applications. The correlations between the surface chemistry, functional groups, the structure of the CDs, and their optical characteristics toward quantum yield, redshift feature, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, have also been discussed. Finally, the progressive trends for the use of CDs in PDT applications are also addressed in this review.

         <title>A Data&#8208;Driven Approach for Enhanced CO2 Capture with Ruthenium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel Ru catalysts in the hydrogenation of CO2 are not easily obtained through simple ligand modification. However, adopting an active descriptor that is obtained from the simplified mechanism&#8208;based approach with data&#8208;driven practice (SMADP) is demonstrated as an efficient strategy to understand the catalytic activity.







Abstract
To attain carbon neutrality, significant efforts have been made to capture and utilize CO2. The homogeneous hydrogenation of CO2 catalyzed by transition metal complexes, particularly the ruthenium complexes, has demonstrated significant advantages and is regarded as a viable approach for practical application. Insertion of CO2 into the Ru&#8722;H bond, producing the Ru&#8208;formate product, is the key step in the hydrogenation of CO2. In order to parameterize the catalytic activities in the CO2 insertion into the Ru&#8722;H bond, the concept of simplified mechanism&#8208;based approach with data&#8208;driven practice (SMADP) has been introduced in this paper. The results showed that the hydricity of the Ru&#8722;H complex (&#916;GH&#8208;) might serve as a single active descriptor in the process of CO2 insertion, and that a novel ruthenium complex in CO2 catalysis may not be easily obtained by mere modification of the auxiliary ligand at the ruthenium metal site.

         <title>Steric Effect and Intrinsic Electrophilicity and Nucleophilicity from Conceptual Density Functional Theory and Information&#8208;Theoretic Approach as Quantitative Probes of Chemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using charge fluctuation descriptors, the intrinsic reaction coordinate is partitioned into three regions which are called Pre&#8208;TS, TS and Post&#8208;TS respectively. For 37 organic and inorganic reactions, linear correlations are found within the three regions between the total energy difference and the steric or charge transfer descriptors. The use of charge fluctuation instead of global reactivity descriptors gives clearer separation of the reaction path which is further justified via energy decomposition analysis.







Abstract
Appreciating reactivity in terms of physicochemical effects for chemical processes is one of the most important undertakings in chemistry. While transition state (TS) theory provides the framework enabling the reliable calculation of the barrier height for a given elementary step, analytical tools are necessary to gain insight into key factors governing the different processes during chemical reactions. In this contribution, we partition the potential energy surface of an elementary step along the intrinsic coordinate into three segments, the so&#8208;called Pre&#8208;TS, TS, and Post&#8208;TS regions, and then determine the most important factors dictating each segment. This analysis is based on the use of both reactivity descriptors from conceptual density functional theory and concepts from the information&#8208;theoretic approach in density functional theory. We found that in both Pre&#8208;TS and Post&#8208;TS regions, steric effects are the dominant factors, whereas in the TS region, it is the intrinsic electrophilic and nucleophilic propensity of the transition state structure that governs the reactivity. The wide applicability of our approach is shown by a validation for a total of 37 organic and inorganic reactions. Different partition approaches from density functional theory, energy decomposition analysis and wavefunction&#8208;based resonance theory are employed to support our main conclusions.

         <title>Symmetric Aromatic Amidoalkylations of Triphenylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient amidoalkylation method of triphenylene derivatives is reported leading to tris&#8208;alkylated C3&#8208;symmetric compounds in good yields. The reaction takes place in the hindered bay regions of the compound for which very few functionalization methods are known in the literature.







Abstract
Triphenylene derivatives are highly investigated for their electronic, supramolecular and photophysical properties, but the direct modification of the central aromatic core is particularly challenging especially in the internal positions 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, and 12. Herein we present an efficient alkylation method of 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexasubstituted triphenylene derivatives leading to tris&#8208;alkylated C3&#8208;symmetric derivatives in good yields using N&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)carboxamide or N&#8208;(alkoxylmethyl)carboxamide alkylating agents.

         <title>Unlocking Selective Anticancer Mechanisms: Dinuclear Manganese Superoxide Dismutase Mimetics Combined with Pt(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dinuclear manganese complexes (Mn2), known for their SOD and CAT mimetic properties, enhance healthy breast cell viability by up to 50&#8201;% and reduce breast cancer cell viability by up to 50&#8201;% when combined with Pt(II) complexes. These Mn2&#8208;containing formulations primarily target mitochondrial processes, affecting cancerous and healthy cells differently. This suggests their potential use for combined SOD&#8208;active and cytostatic treatments.







Abstract
We conducted an in&#8208;depth exploration of the in&#8197;vitro activities of the dinuclear Mn2L2Ac and Mn2L2 complexes (where HL=2&#8208;{[di(2&#8208;pyridyl)methylamino]&#8208;methyl}phenol), possessing dual superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity.
We investigated these complexes both individually and in conjunction with various Pt(II)&#8208;complexes, either as mixtures or as the Mn2&#8208;Pt adducts. Our findings revealed a notable up to 50&#8201;% enhancement in the viability of healthy human breast cells, contrasted with a viability decrease as low as 50&#8201;% in breast cancer cells upon combined treatments with Mn2 SOD mimics and Pt(II) complexes. Specifically, we synthesized and characterized the self&#8208;assembled Mn2&#8208;Pt adducts (isolated Mn2L2Pt and in&#8197;situ Mn2L2Pt&#8217;), linking Mn2L2&#8208;core with the carboxylate group of PtDAPCl2 (dichloro(2,3&#8208;diaminopropionic acid) platinum(II)). The SOD activity of the isolated Mn2L2Pt adduct (kSOD=1.7&#215;107&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) remained intact. Through in vitro cell viability assessments, ROS levels, cellular Mn uptake and proteomics measurements, we elucidated key mechanisms underlying the observed biological effects. We demonstrated that Mn2&#8208;containing formulations predominantly target mitochondrial processes, differently affecting the proteome of cancerous and healthy cells. They induced downregulation of H2S signaling and expression of mitochondrial complex I and III, as well as increased oxidative phosphorylation pathways and upregulation of EGFR in cancer cells. In contrast, healthy cells showed a decrease in EGFR expression and a moderate enrichment in oxidative phosphorylation pathways.

         <title>Helix&#8208;to&#8208;Disc Conversion of Thia[6]helicenes into Coronenes Facilitated by Sulfur Oxidation and Fluorination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur oxidation and terminal tetrafluorination successfully transforms helical thia[6]helicene into disc&#8208;like 1,2&#8208;difluorocoronene, whose unique columnar stacking structure was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. This skeletal transformation, initiated by an intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, demonstrates how strategic chemical modifications can reconfigure the molecular architectures of polycyclic aromatics.







Abstract
Helicenes, with their unique helical structures, have long captured the interest of synthetic chemists, not only as end products, but also as versatile platforms for further chemical transformations. However, transforming [6]helicene into planar coronene typically requires harsh conditions and poses significant challenges. Herein, we demonstrate that replacing the terminal benzene ring of [6]helicene with a thiophene ring enables its photochemical transformation into coronene. Sulfur oxidation of the thiophene ring enables the corresponding thermal transformation, and the terminal tetrafluorination of the opposite benzene ring further accelerates this process, yielding 1,2&#8208;difluorocoronene, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The transformation begins with an intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, whose activation energy is significantly lowered by these structural changes. Our findings underscore the utility of strategic modifications such as sulfur oxidation and fluorination in promoting this &#8220;helix&#8208;to&#8208;disc&#8221; conversion and opening new avenues for synthesizing functional polycyclic aromatics.

         <title>N&#8208;Glycosylation&#8208;Induced Pathologic Protein Conformations as a Tool to Guide the Selection of Biologically Active Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomistic model for the prediction of ligand residence times in protein targets, taking explicitly into account normal vs. pathologic conformations of chaperone Grp94, is developed and tested. Analysis of binding site and ligand stereoelectronic properties unveils relationships between chemical, conformational properties, and biological activities of ligands. These findings facilitate the design of ligands targeting pathologic Grp94 conformations.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modifications such as protein N&#8208;glycosylation, significantly influence cellular processes. Dysregulated N&#8208;glycosylation, exemplified in Grp94, a member of the Hsp90 family, leads to structural changes and the formation of epichaperomes, contributing to pathologies. Targeting N&#8208;glycosylation&#8208;induced conformations offers opportunities for developing selective chemical tools and drugs for these pathologic forms of chaperones. We here demonstrate how a specific Grp94 conformation induced by N&#8208;glycosylation, identified previously via molecular dynamics simulations, rationalizes the distinct behavior of similar ligands. Integrating dynamic ligand unbinding information with SAR development, we differentiate ligands productively engaging the pathologic Grp94 conformers from those that are not. Additionally, analyzing binding site stereoelectronic properties and QSAR models using cytotoxicity data unveils relationships between chemical, conformational properties, and biological activities. These findings facilitate the design of ligands targeting specific Grp94 conformations induced by abnormal glycosylation, selectively disrupting pathogenic protein networks while sparing normal mechanisms.

         <title>Dimethylene&#8208;Cyclopropanide Units as Building Blocks for Fluorescence Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dimethylene&#8208;cyclopropanide moiety is used as key scaffold for the design of fluorescent dyes which emit light in solution and in solids. In particular, malonic ester groups induce a remarkable twist angle of about 20&#176; between a pyridinium substituent and the cyclopropanide plane, resulting in enhanced light emission in solids.







Abstract
Many organic dyes are fluorescent in solution. In the solid state, however, quenching processes often dominate, hampering material science applications such as light filters, light&#8208;emitting devices, or coding tags. We show that the dimethylene&#8208;cyclopropanide scaffold can be used to form two structurally different types of chromophores, which feature fluorescence quantum yields up to 0.66 in dimethyl sulfoxide and 0.53 in solids. The increased fluorescence in the solid state for compounds bearing malonate substituents instead of dicyanomethide ones is rationalized by the induced twist between the planes of the cyclopropanide core and a pyridine ligand.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Terpenoid dimers of the [4+2] type, which are naturally occurring compounds biosynthetically derived from the [4+2] cycloaddition of two synthons, have garnered considerable attention due to their complex molecular structures, diverse biological activities, and intriguing biosynthetic pathways.

In this review, we will focus on the lesser&#8208;explored class of [4+2] terpenoid dimers which assembled from two electron&#8208;deficient synthons via the unmatched&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder reaction&#160; (UMEDDA).

Acid&#8208;induced reduction of &#951;2&#8208;bound NO2&#8722; to NO(g) on CoII&#8722;CoII centers in a hetero&#8208;bimetallic CuII&#8208;nitrito&#8208;CoII complex, [(LN8H)CuII&#8722;NO2&#8722;&#8722;CoII]3+ (CuII&#8722;NO2&#8722;&#8722;CoII) bearing an octadentate N8&#8208;cryptand ligand (LN8H) via a proposed nitrous acid [(LN8H)CuII&#8722;ONOH&#8722;CoII]4+ ([Cu(ONOH)Co]+4) intermediate species.







Abstract
Nitrite (NO2&#8722;) serves as a pool of nitric oxide (NO) in biological systems under hypoxic conditions, and it is transformed to NO by nitrite reductase (NiR) enzyme in the presence of acid (H+ ions). However, NO synthases (NOSs) generate NO via L&#8208;arginine oxidation in normoxic conditions. Previously, acid&#8208;induced NO2&#8722; reduction chemistry was modeled on mono&#8208;metallic 3d&#8208;metals, generating metal&#8208;nitrosyls or NO(g) with H2O or H2O2 products. Herein, to understand the relative potency of a bimetallic system, we report the acid&#8208;induced reductive conversion of &#951;2&#8208;bound NO2&#8722; to NO on CuII&#8722;CoII centers of a hetero&#8208;bimetallic CuII&#8208;nitrito&#8208;CoII complex, [(LN8H)CuII&#8722;NO2&#8722;&#8722;CoII]3+ (CuII&#8722;NO2&#8722;&#8722;CoII, 2) bearing an octadentate N8&#8208;cryptand ligand (LN8H). The CuII&#8722;NO2&#8722;&#8722;CoII generates [CuII(LN8H)CoII]4+ (1) upon reaction with one equiv. acid (HClO4, H+ ions source) with NO(g) via a presumed transient nitrousacid (ONOH) intermediate species. Likewise, this NO2&#8722; reduction was found to form H2O, which is believed to be from the decomposition of H2O2, an intermediate species. In addition, complex 2, in the presence of more than one equiv. H+ ions also showed the formation of NO(g) with H2O. Mechanistic investigations, using 15N&#8208;labeled&#8208;15NO2&#8722;, 18O&#8208;labeled&#8208;18O14N16O&#8722; and 2H&#8208;labeled&#8208;DClO4 (D+ source), revealed that the N&#8208;atom and O&#8208;atom in the 14/15NO and 14N18O gases are derived from NO2&#8722; ligand and H&#8208;atom in H2O derived from H+&#8208;source, respectively.

         <title>A Review of Electrospun Carbon&#8208;Based Nanofibers Materials used in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrospun carbon&#8208;based nanofibers materials have characteristics such as high electronic conductivity, large specific surface area, and good flexibility. This article reviews representative research results of different types of CNF (with various pore structures, heteroatoms, metallic compounds, and other substances) as sulfur hosts and interlayer materials to improve the performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
Commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries are gradually approaching their theoretical specific energy, which cannot meet the fast&#8208;growing energy storage demands. Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries are anticipated to supersede lithium&#8208;ion batteries as the next&#8208;generation energy storage system owing to their high atheoretical specific capacity (1675&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and energy density (2600&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1). Nonetheless, Li&#8722;S batteries encounter several challenges, including the inadequate conductivity of sulfur and lithium sulfide, sulfur's volume expansion, and the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides, all of which significantly impact the practical utilization of Li&#8722;S batteries. Electrospun carbon&#8208;based nanofibers can simultaneously resolve these issues with their economical preparation, distinctive nanostructure, and exceptional flexibility. This review presents the most recent research findings on electrospun carbon&#8208;based nanofibers materials serving as sulfur hosts and interlayer components in Li&#8722;S batteries. We analyzed the impact of the material's structural design on the performance of Li&#8722;S batteries and the relative underlying mechanism. Finally, the current challenges and issues faced by carbon&#8208;based nanofibers composites in the application of Li&#8722;S batteries are summarized, and the future development trajectory are outlined.

         <title>Halogen and Chalcogen Activation by Nucleophilic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic halogen activation has seen substantial transformation in the last several years. The ability to selectively and efficiently activate halogen functionalities through nucleophilic catalysis holds promise for enhancing reaction specificity, selectivity, and sustainability. This review will outline important nucleophilic activators that have been employed for halogen activation and describes their mode of action.







Abstract
The high utility of halogenated organic compounds has prompted the development of numerous transformations that install the carbon&#8208;halogen motif. Halogen functionalities, deemed as &#8220;functional and functionalizable&#8221; molecules due to their capacity to modulate diverse internal properties, constitute a pivotal strategy in drug discovery and development. Traditional routes to these building blocks have commonly involved multiple steps, harsh reaction conditions, and the use of stoichiometric and/or toxic reagents. With the emergence of solid halogen carriers such as N&#8208;halosuccinimides, and halohydantoins as popular sources of halonium ions, the past decade has witnessed enormous growth in the development of new catalytic strategies for halofunctionalization. This review aims to provide a nuanced perspective on nucleophilic activators and their roles in halogen activation. It will highlight critical discoveries in effecting racemic and asymmetric variants of these reactions, driven by the development of new catalysts, activation modes, and improved understanding of chemical reactivity and reaction kinetics.

         <title>Binary Catalytic Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange of Free &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids and Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Deuterated products with up to 91&#8201;% yield and up to 100&#8201;% D incorp. were obtained in H/D exchange reaction of free amino acids and derivatives (esters or amides) in the presence of inexpensive D2O using a binary catalysis system containing benzaldehyde and Cs2CO3 or phenylalanine Cs&#8208;salt.







Abstract
The increasing demand for deuterium&#8208;labeled amino acids and derivatives has heightened interest in direct hydrogen/deuterium exchange reactions of free amino acids. Existing methods, including biocatalysis and metal catalysis, typically require expensive deuterium sources or excessive use of deuterium reagents and often struggle with site selectivity. In contrast, this binary catalysis system, employing benzaldehyde and Cs2CO3 in the presence of inexpensive D2O with minimal stoichiometric quantities, facilitates efficient hydrogen/deuterium exchange at the &#945;&#8208;position of amino acids without the need for protecting groups in the polar aprotic solvent DMSO. The process is highly compatible with most natural and non&#8208;natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids and derivatives, even those with potentially reactive functionalities. This advancement not only addresses the cost and efficiency concerns of existing methods but also significantly broadens the applicability and precision of deuterium labeling in biochemical research.

&lt;p&gt;&#945;-Deuterated products with up to 91&#8201;% yield and up to 100&#8201;% D incorp. were obtained in H/D exchange reaction of free amino acids and derivatives (esters or amides) in the presence of inexpensive D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O using a binary catalysis system containing benzaldehyde and Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or phenylalanine Cs-salt.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increasing demand for deuterium-labeled amino acids and derivatives has heightened interest in direct hydrogen/deuterium exchange reactions of free amino acids. Existing methods, including biocatalysis and metal catalysis, typically require expensive deuterium sources or excessive use of deuterium reagents and often struggle with site selectivity. In contrast, this binary catalysis system, employing benzaldehyde and Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in the presence of inexpensive D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O with minimal stoichiometric quantities, facilitates efficient hydrogen/deuterium exchange at the &#945;-position of amino acids without the need for protecting groups in the polar aprotic solvent DMSO. The process is highly compatible with most natural and non-natural &#945;-amino acids and derivatives, even those with potentially reactive functionalities. This advancement not only addresses the cost and efficiency concerns of existing methods but also significantly broadens the applicability and precision of deuterium labeling in biochemical research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Investigating the Catalytic Site of Human 15&#8208;Lipoxygenase&#8208;1&#8201;via Marine Natural Products</title>

Human 15&#8208;lipoxygenase&#8208;1 is an enzyme with a key role in various diseases. We developed a library of chiral smart molecules to explore, navigate and inhibit this enzyme, integrating specific structural elements from marine&#8208;derived natural product phosphoeleganin (PE) and synthetic fragment derivatives. These PE&#8208;based inhibitors exhibit time&#8208;dependent inhibition and varying potency based on stereochemistry and warhead positioning.







Abstract
Human 15&#8208;lipoxygenase&#8208;1 (15&#8208;LOX&#8208;1) is a key enzyme that possesses an important role in (neuro)inflammatory diseases. The pocket of the enzyme plays the role of a chiral catalyst, and therefore chirality could be an important component for the design of effective enzyme inhibitors. To advance our knowledge on this concept, we developed a library of the identified chiral 15&#8208;LOX&#8208;1 inhibitors and applied cheminformatic tools. Our analysis highlighted specific structural elements, which we integrated them in small molecules, and employed them as &#8220;smart&#8221; tools to effectively navigate the chemical space of previously unexplored regions. To this purpose, we utilized the marine derived natural product phosphoeleganin (PE) among with a small library of synthetic fragment derivatives, including a certain degree of stereochemical diversity. Enzyme inhibition/kinetic and molecular modelling studies has been performed in order to characterize structurally novel PE&#8208;based inhibitors, which proved to present a different type of inhibition with low micromolar potency, according to their structural features. We demonstrate that different warheads work as anchor, and either guide specific stereochemistry, or causing a time&#8208;depended inhibition. Finally, we prove that the positioning of the chiral substituents or/and the favorable stereochemistry can be crucial, as it can lead from active to completely inactive compounds.

         <title>Gold Trifluoromethyl Complexes as Efficient Regioselective Catalysts in Alkyne Hydration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Easy&#8208;access gold (III) complexes containing three trifluoromethyl and a labile ligand (MeCN or THT) are efficient catalysts in hydration of terminal and internal alkynes. The gold fragment &#8220;(CF3)3Au&#8221; induces moderate to notable regioselectivities in hydration of internal asymmetric alkynes.







Abstract
Gold(III) complexes containing trifluoromethyl ligands are efficient catalysts in the hydration of alkynes, operating at low catalyst loadings, without additives, using environmentally friendly solvents and at mild conditions (60&#8201;&#176;C). Hydration of terminal and internal alkynes provides the corresponding ketones in quantitative yields without special precautions as dry solvents or inert atmospheres. Remarkably, hydration of asymmetric internal alkynes proceeds with moderate to notable regioselectivities, providing mixtures of the two possible isomers with ratios up to 90&#8201;:&#8201;10.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Masked Organic Sulfates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although nature presents unique sulfated endobiotics (e.&#8201;g., sulfated glycosaminoglycans, sulfated tyrosine peptides, sulfated steroids/bile acids/catecholamines, etc.) that are antithrombotic, antimicrobial, and/or anticancer in action, major hurdles exist in their synthesis. This review focuses on synthetic masking/unmasking strategies that can help realize highly sulfated molecules as drugs.







Abstract
Nature offers a variety of structurally unique, sulfated endobiotics including sulfated glycosaminoglycans, sulfated tyrosine peptides, sulfated steroids/bile acids/catecholamines. Sulfated molecules display a large number of biological activities including antithrombotic, antimicrobial, anticancer, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and others, which arise from modulation of intracellular signaling and enhanced in&#8197;vivo retention of certain hormones. These characteristics position sulfated molecules very favorably as drug&#8208;like agents. However, few have reached the clinic. Major hurdles exist in realizing sulfated molecules as drugs. This state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art has been transformed through recent works on the development of sulfate masking technologies for both alkyl (sulfated carbohydrates, sulfated steroids) and aryl (sTyr&#8208;bearing peptides/proteins, sulfated flavonoids) sulfates. This review compiles the literature on different strategies implemented for different types of sulfate groups. Starting from early efforts in protection of sulfate groups to the design of newer SuFEx, trichloroethyl, and gem&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;based protection technologies, this review presents the evolution and application of concepts in realizing highly diverse, sulfated molecules as candidate drugs and/or prodrugs. Overall, the newer strategies for sulfate masking and demasking are likely to greatly enhance the design and development of sulfated molecules as non&#8208;toxic drugs of the future.

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Selective Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Glycosyl Phosphate Repeating Structure Via the Phosphoramidite Method</title>

A Leishmania promastigote has immunologically important lipophosphoglycans (LPGs) on its surface and LPGs contain characteristic [&#8594;6)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;Gal&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;Man&#8208;(1&#8208;PO3H] repeating units. In this study, the repeating structure was synthesized up to a triacontasaccharide derivative for the first&#8208;time using disaccharide &#945;&#8208;1&#8208;phosphoramidite derivative as a building block. The length of the product is comparable to that of a Leishmania promastigote LPGs.







Abstract
Lipophosphoglycans (LPGs) are found on the surface of Leishmania, a protozoan parasite, and are immunologically important. Herein, disaccharide 1&#8208;phosphate repeating units of LPGs were successfully synthesized on a solid support with high anomeric purity using a disaccharide &#945;&#8208;1&#8208;phosphoramidite building block. To enhance solubility in the reaction solvent, hydroxy&#8208;protecting groups in the form of para&#8208;t&#8208;butylbenzoyl were introduced to the building block. The saccharide chain was elongated via stable glycosyl boranophosphate linkages, followed by the conversion of inter&#8208;sugar linkages to phosphodiester counterparts using an oxaziridine derivative. The addition of a silylating reagent post&#8208;reaction with the oxaziridine derivative efficiently facilitated the conversion of boranophosohodiesters to phosphodiesters. This method enabled the &#945;&#8208;selective synthesis of up to 15 repeating units, marking the longest homogeneous repeating units of LPGs synthesized chemically. Given the chain length equivalence to native LPGs, the method developed herein holds promise for advancing anti&#8208;Leishmanial pharmaceuticals and vaccines.

         <title>Highly Selective Boron&#8208;Wittig Reaction: A Practical Method to Synthesize Trans&#8208;Aryl Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective Boron&#8208;Wittig reaction for trans&#8208;alkenes has been developed, offering a practical pathway to access diverse trans&#8208;alkenes from readily available carbonyl compounds.







Abstract
Olefins play an essential role in synthetic chemistry, serving not only as important synthons but also as key functional groups in numerous bio&#8208;active molecules. Consequently, there has been considerable interest in the development of more powerful methods for olefins. While the Wittig reaction stands as a prominent choice for olefin synthesis due to its simplicity and the ready availability of raw materials, its limitation lies in the challenge of controlling cis&#8208;trans selectivity, hampering its broader application. In this study, a novel Boron&#8208;Wittig reaction has been developed utilizing gem&#8208;bis(boryl)alkanes and aldehydes as starting materials. This method enables creating favourable intermediates, which possess less steric hindrance, and leading to trans&#8208;olefins via intramolecular O&#8722;B bonds elimination. Notably, synthesis studies have validated its good efficacy in modifying bioactive molecules and synthesizing drug molecules with great trans&#8208;selectivity.

     alt="Highly Selective Boron-Wittig Reaction: A Practical Method to Synthesize Trans-Aryl Alkenes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A highly selective Boron-Wittig reaction for trans-alkenes has been developed, offering a practical pathway to access diverse trans-alkenes from readily available carbonyl compounds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olefins play an essential role in synthetic chemistry, serving not only as important synthons but also as key functional groups in numerous bio-active molecules. Consequently, there has been considerable interest in the development of more powerful methods for olefins. While the Wittig reaction stands as a prominent choice for olefin synthesis due to its simplicity and the ready availability of raw materials, its limitation lies in the challenge of controlling &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; selectivity, hampering its broader application. In this study, a novel Boron-Wittig reaction has been developed utilizing &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-bis(boryl)alkanes and aldehydes as starting materials. This method enables creating favourable intermediates, which possess less steric hindrance, and leading to &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-olefins via intramolecular O&#8722;B bonds elimination. Notably, synthesis studies have validated its good efficacy in modifying bioactive molecules and synthesizing drug molecules with great &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-selectivity. Furthermore, the reaction mechanism was elucidated based on intermediate trapping experiments, isotope labelling studies, and kinetic analyses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A New Structural Motif in Aggregation of Methylalumoxanes: Non&#8208;Hydrolytic Route by the Alkylation of Dicarboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report the first systematic studies on the alkylation of dicarboxylic acids by AlMe3 that, passing through the double methylation of each carboxylic group, allowed for the isolation and structural characterisation of a family of methylalumoxanes incorporating neutral Me10Al6O4 scaffold flanked by methylaluminium diolate units.







Abstract
Alumoxanes are typically produced via controlled hydrolysis of short&#8208;chain alkyl aluminium compounds which leads to oligomeric species that are usually difficult to obtain in crystalline form. Simultaneously, various alternative non&#8208;hydrolytic approaches to alumoxanes have also been used. In this work, we report on a new methylalumoxane scaffold derived from the alkylation of a series of dicarboxylic acids: itaconic acid (HO2CCH2C(=CH2)CO2H), succinic acid (HO2CCH2CH2CO2H) and homophthalic acid (HO2CCH2C6H4CO2H). The reactions of AlMe3 with a selected dicarboxylic acid in the molar ratio 4&#8201;:&#8201;1 conducted at elevated temperature occur with double methylation of each carboxylic group and provide to the formation of a new methylalumoxane aggregate, Me10Al6O4, flanked by methylaluminium diolate units. We also aimed to obtain dialkylaluminium derivatives of dicarboxylic acids by the controlled reaction of the appropriate acid with AlMe3 in the 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 stoichiometry. While the synthesis of organoaluminium derivatives of flexible aliphatic dicarboxylic acids (itaconic and succinic acids) is challenging due to their insolubility, the related homophtalate compound readily forms a molecular tetranuclear cluster, [([(O2CCH2C6H4CO2)(&#956;&#8208;AlMe2)2]2. The molecular and crystal structures of the resulting compounds were determined via NMR spectroscopic analysis and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction crystallography.

         <title>Transition Metal Complexes with Appended Benzimidazole Groups for Sensing Dihydrogenphosphate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anion recognition behaviour of several emissive metal complexes, with appended benzimidazole groups, is discussed. These show a selective response to both acetate and dihydrogen phosphate: with acetate these complexes appear to adopt a simple one to one adduct, but with dihydrogenphosphate several binding modes are evident dependant on the steric influence of the complex, and the solvent environment.







Abstract
Four new complexes [Ru(bpy)2(bbib)](PF6)2, [Ru(phen)2(bbib)](PF6)2, [Re(CO)3(bbib)(py)](PF6) and [Ir(ppy)2(bbib)](PF6) [where bbib=4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine] have been prepared and their photophysical properties determined. Their behaviour has been studied with a variety of anions in acetonitrile, DMSO and 10&#8201;% aquated DMSO. Acetate and dihydrogenphosphate demonstrate a redshift in the bbib ligand associated absorptions suggesting that the ligand is strongly interacting with these anions. The 3MLCT emissive state is sensitive to the introduction of small quantities of anion (sub&#8208;stoichiometric quantities) and significant quenching is typically observed with acetate, although this is less pronounced in the presence of water. The emissive behaviour with dihydrogenphosphate is variable, showing systematic changes as anion concentration increases with several distinct interactions evident. 1H&#8208; and 31P&#8208;NMR titrations in a 10&#8201;% D2O&#8722;DMSO&#8208;D6 mixture suggest that with dihydrogenphosphate, the imidazole group is able to act as both a proton acceptor and donor. It appears that all four complexes can form a {[complex]2&#8208;H2PO4} &#8220;dimer&#8221;, a one&#8208;to&#8208;one species (which the X&#8208;ray crystallography study suggests is dimeric in the solid&#8208;state), and a complex with a combined bis(dihydrogenphosphate) complex anion. The speciation relies on complex equilibria dependent on several factors including the complex charge, the hydrophobicity of the associated ligands, and the solvent.

         <title>CaLi2PN3 &#8211; A Quaternary Chain&#8208;Type Nitridophosphate by Medium&#8208;Pressure Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CaLi2PN3 was synthesized under MP conditions and analyzed by SCXRD, EDX and MAS NMR. Beside an established bottom&#8208;up approach, we present a novel double salt approach, starting from pre&#8208;synthesized nitridophosphate&#8208;precursors. DFT calculations provide insights into the band structure and the relative stability to the used precursors. This new approach represents a promising addition to the synthesis strategies in nitridophosphate chemistry.







Abstract
Nitridophosphates are in the focus of current research interest due to their structural versatility and properties, such as ion conductivity, ultra&#8208;incompressibility and luminescent properties when doped with suitable activator ions. Multinary representatives often require thorough investigation due to the competition with the thermodynamically more stable binary and ternary compounds. Another point of concern is the synthetic control of structural details, which is usually limited by conventional bottom&#8208;up syntheses. In this study, we report on the synthesis and characterization of the quaternary nitridophosphate CaLi2PN3. Various synthesis protocols were used for the preparation of CaLi2PN3, including the novel nitridophosphate double salt approach. The crystal structure was solved and refined from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data and confirmed by Rietveld refinement, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, EDX measurements and low&#8208;cost crystallographic calculations. The experimental results were corroborated by DFT calculations, which revealed the electronic band structure. Formation energy calculations allowed conclusions to be drawn about the stability in comparison to the initial ternary nitridophosphates. The synthesis of CaLi2PN3 exemplifies the enormous potential of medium&#8208;pressure syntheses in the field of nitridophosphate research. Furthermore, the presented new synthesis route allows a certain degree of structural control, which is a promising addition to previous synthesis strategies in nitridophosphate chemistry.

         <title>DNA Molecular Glue Assisted Bacterial Conjugative Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacterial conjugation, a widely used method to transfer DNA from the donor to the recipient strains, shows a very low efficiency with the current method. A new technique that employed DNA molecule &#8220;glue&#8221; to connect the donor and recipient bacteria to address this issue has been realized for the first time here, mechanistically different from the reported method of using nanomaterials, exploring a new field for the applications of DNA nanotechnology.







Abstract
Bacterial conjugation, a commonly used method to horizontally transfer functional genes from donor to recipient strains, plays an important role in the genetic manipulation of bacteria for basic research and industrial production. Successful conjugation depends on the donor&#8208;recipient cell recognition and a tight mating junction formation. However, the efficiency of conjugative transfer is usually very low. In this work, we developed a new technique that employed DNA molecule &#8220;glue&#8221; to increase the match frequency and the interaction stability between the donor and recipient cells. We used two E. coli strains, ETZ and BL21, as a model system, and modified them with the complementary ssDNA oligonucleotides by click chemistry. The conjugation efficiency of the modified bacteria was improved more than 4 times from 10&#8201;%&#8211;46&#8201;%. This technique is simple and generalizable as it only relies on the active amino groups on the bacterial surface. It is expected to have broad applications in constructing engineered bacteria.

We used two &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; strains, ETZ and BL21, as a model system, and modified them with the complementary ssDNA oligonucleotides by click chemistry. The conjugation efficiency of the modified bacteria was improved more than 4 times from 10&#8201;%&#8211;46&#8201;%. This technique is simple and generalizable as it only relies on the active amino groups on the bacterial surface. It is expected to have broad applications in constructing engineered bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aliphatic Ketone Claisen Rearrangement: Troubleshooting the Transetherification Step by Identifying a Stable Acid Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple catalyst for the ketone Claisen rearrangement. By optimizing the benzoic acid catalysts for the Claisen rearrangement sequence that starts with allylic alcohols and enol ethers or ketone acetals, 4&#8208;chlorobenzoic acid catalyst emerged as a catalyst that retains its activity in the process. This catalyst enables ketone Claisen reactions with even acid&#8208; and heat&#8208;sensitive protecting groups, such as tert&#8208;butoxycarbonylamines (BocNH), or tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) ethers.







Abstract
After optimization for retention of catalytic activity, 4&#8208;chlorobenzoic acid emerged as the optimal catalyst for the aliphatic ketone Claisen rearrangement. The optimal catalyst enables a one&#8208;pot, metal&#8208;free, catalytic protocol from allylic alcohols to &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. The optimized process tolerates a range of substrates, including substituents with acid&#8208;labile protecting groups. Reaction monitoring and DFT studies of the aliphatic ketone Claisen process agree that the ultimate rearrangement step typically has the highest activation barrier.

         <title>Hydrazone&#8208;Linked Donor&#8208;Acceptor Covalent Organic Polymer as a Heterogeneous Photocatalyst for C&#8722;S Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel hydrazone&#8208;linked donor&#8208;acceptor covalent organic polymer ETBC&#8208;PyHz, as an efficient photocatalyst for an oxidative cross&#8208;coupling reaction involving C&#8722;S bond formation. This environment&#8208;friendly method does not require a metal&#8208;based catalyst and does not generate side products.







Abstract
In the realm of solar energy utilization, there is a growing focus on designing and implementing effective photocatalytic systems, for the conversion of solar energy into valuable chemical fuels. The potential of Covalent Organic Polymers (COPs) as photocatalysts for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven organic transformation has been widely investigated, positioning them as promising candidates in this field. In the design of COPs, introducing a donor&#8208;acceptor arrangement facilitates the transfer of electrons from the donor to the acceptor, creating a charge transfer complex and leading to enhanced conductivity and improved charge separation. Here we present a novel hydrazone&#8208;linked covalent organic polymer ETBC&#8208;PyHz containing TPE donor and pyridine acceptor. Utilizing this, an efficient method has been developed for an oxidative cross&#8208;coupling reaction involving C&#8722;S bond formation. This process involves arylhydrazines and arenethiols, and results in the production of unsymmetrical diaryl sulfides via the formation of aryl and thioarene radicals. This conversion holds significant importance because the byproducts produced during the process are nitrogen and water, making it environmentally benign.

         <title>Amorphous Strategy and Doping Copper on Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Surface for Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to C2H4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous MOF was prepared by using the regulator, which significantly improved the carrier separation efficiency and the selectivity of multi&#8208;electron products. The addition of surfactants effectively alleviates the agglomeration of MOF, further improve the carrier separation efficiency and promote the formation of ethylene products. Finally, copper doping and amorphous MOF cooperate to improve the yield of ethylene products.







Abstract
Amorphous photocatalysts are characterized by numerous grain boundaries and abundant unsaturated sites, which enhance reaction efficiency from both kinetic and thermodynamic perspectives. However, amorphization strategies have rarely been used for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Doping copper onto a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) surface can regulate the electronic structure of photocatalysts, promote electron transfer from the MOF to Cu, and improve the separation efficiency of electron&#8208;hole pairs. In this study, an amorphous photocatalyst MOFw&#8208;p/Cu containing highly dispersed Cu (0, I, II) sites was designed and synthesized by introducing a regulator and in&#8197;situ copper species during the nucleation process of MOF (UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2). Various characterizations confirmed that the Cu species were anchored to the organometallic skeleton of the surface amorphization MOF structure. The synergistic effect of Cu doping and surface amorphization in MOFw&#8208;p/Cu can significantly enhance the CO and CH4 yields while promoting the formation of the multicarbon product C2H4. The approach holds promise for developing novel, highly efficient MOFs as photocatalysts for CO2 photoreduction, enabling the production of high&#8208;value&#8208;added C2 products.

         <dc:description>Triple&#8208;stranded helical lanthanide MOFs with CO2 adsorption properties were investigated. Lanthanide MOFs ([Eu0.1Tb0.9(hfa)3(dpa)]n) are composed of lanthanide luminophores (Eu(III) and/or Tb(III) ions), fluorinated antenna ligands (hfa: hexafluoroacetylacetonate), and polyamide&#8208;type linker ligands (dpa: 4&#8208;(diphenylphosphoryl)&#8208;N&#8208;(4&#8208;(diphenylphosphoryl)phenyl)benzamide). The cylindrical structure was characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, and gas adsorption measurements. The inner surfaces of the cylindrical channels were covered with the fluorine atoms of the hfa ligands. The emission intensity ratio (IEu / ITb) in [Eu0.1Tb0.9(hfa)3(dpa)]n is affected by the CO2 gas adsorption behavior. The change in IEu / ITb value was caused by the intermolecular interactions between the CO2 gas molecules and the fluorinated ligands, resulting in an electronic structural change of the lowest triplet excited state in the photosensitized hfa ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the Helical Pitch of Foldamers Through Terminal Functionality: A Solid State Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new methods to control the size and shape of the helical structures adopted by foldamers is highly important as the secondary structure displayed by these supramolecular scaffolds often dictates their activity and function. Herein, we report on a systematic study demonstrating that the helical pitch of ortho&#8208;azobenzene/2,6&#8208;pyridyldicarboamide foldamers can be readily controlled through the nature of the terminal functionality. Remarkably, simply through varying the end group of the foldamer, and without modifying any other structural features of the scaffold, the helical pitch can be over doubled in magnitude (from 3.4 &#197; to 7.3 &#197;). Additionally, crystallographic analysis of a library ten foldamers has identified general trends in the influence of a range of terminal functionalities, including carboxylbenzyl (Cbz), diphenylcarbamyl (N(Ph)2), ferrocene (Fc) and tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), in controlling the folding behaviour of these supramolecular scaffolds. These studies could prove useful in the future development of functional foldamers which adopt specific sizes and shapes.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox Activity of Co Species in the Active Sites of CoN x /CoO x &#160;Facilitates Oxygen Electrocatalysis for Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient bifunctional&#160;oxygen electrocatalysts is crucial for enhancing the performance of rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). In this study, cobalt/cobalt oxides embedded in N&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers (Co/CoOx/NCNFs) were synthesized through&#160;a combination of electrospinning and annealing processes. The resulting Co/CoOx/NCNFs catalysts feature abundant CoNx&#160;and CoOx&#160;active species, leveraging the large specific surface area&#160;of nanofibers to facilitate oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction&#160;(OER). The optimized&#160;Co/CoOx/NCNFs&#8208;0.1 achieved&#160;a half&#8208;wave potential (vs. RHE) of 0.82 V and required only 429 mV to reach 10 mA cm&#8315;&#178; in a typical three&#8208;electrode system with 0.1 M KOH using an electrochemical workstation equipped with a pine instruments rotator, outperforming the Pt/C+RuO2. The assembled ZABs&#160;exhibited high specific capacity (771 mAh gZn&#8722;1), substantial power density (981.6 mWh gZn&#8722;1), and long&#8208;term stability (&gt;325 h). In situ Raman spectroscopy confirmed that the electrocatalytic processes involve&#160;the redox activity&#160;of Co (II and III) species derived from abundant CoNx&#160;and CoOx, elaborating&#160;the origin&#160;of the catalysts' exceptional oxygen electrocatalysis performance. This work&#160;not only presents a straightforward and effective approach for producing bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts in ZABs but also sheds light on the catalytic mechanisms underlying ORR and OER&#160;for CoNx/CoOx&#8208;based oxygen electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Chemistry of a Halogenated Borazine: From Supramolecular Assemblies to a Random Covalent BN&#8208;Substituted Carbon Network</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The on&#8208;surface synthesis strategy has emerged as a promising route for fabricating well&#8208;defined two&#8208;dimensional (2D) BN&#8208;substituted carbon nanomaterials with tunable electronic properties. This approach relies on specially designed precursors and requires a thorough understanding of the on&#8208;surface reaction pathways. It promises precise structural control at the atomic scale, thus complementing chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In this study, we investigated a novel heteroatomic precursor, tetrabromoborazine, which incorporates a BN core and an OH group, on Ag(111) using low temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy (LT&#8208;STM/STS) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Through sequential temperature&#8208;induced reactions involving dehalogenation and dehydrogenation, distinct tetrabromoborazine derivatives were produced as reaction intermediates, leading to the formation of specific self&#8208;assemblies. Notably, the resulting intricate supramolecular structures include a chiral kagom&#233; lattice composed of molecular dimers exhibiting a unique electronic signature. The final product obtained was a random covalent carbon network with BN&#8208;substitution and embedded oxygen heteroatoms. Our study offers valuable insights into the significance of the structure and functionalization of BN precursors in temperature&#8208;induced on&#8208;surface reactions, which can help future rational precursor design. Additionally, it introduces complex surface architectures that offer a high areal density of borazine cores.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Twisted Fenestrindane&#8208;Based Porous Nanographenes</title>

         <dc:description>Two fenestrindane&#8208;based porous nanographenes containing four polyaromatic macrocycles in a highly twisted, basically S4&#8208;symmetric conformation were synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Stepwise &#960;&#8208;extension at the periphery of the fenestrindane core by a sequence of eightfold Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling, fourfold Scholl cyclodehydrogenation and another eightfold Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction affords the porous nanographene precursors in good yields. In the last step, fourfold intramolecular Yamamoto coupling generates the porous nanographenes in 17&#8722;18% yield. Their optical and electronic properties were studied by UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. DFT calculations revealed structural details of the macrocycles. The surprisingly weak binding of these porous structures with chloride ions (K &#8776; 10 M&#8722;1) is attributed to their highly twisted conformation. The title compounds represent the first porous nanographenes based on the [5.5.5.5]fenestrane motif and, at the same time, they consist of a fenestrane&#8208;like polyarylene network.</dc:description>

         <title>Anchoring Pt Single&#8208;Atom Sites on Vacancies of MgO(Al) Nanosheets as Bifunctional Catalysts to Accelerate Hydrogenation&#8208;Cyclization Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct hydrogenation of 2&#8208;nitroacylbenzene to 2,1&#8208;benzisoxazole presents a significant challenge in the pharmaceutical and fine chemicals industries. In this study, a defect engineering strategy is employed to create bifunctional single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) by anchoring Pt single atoms onto metal vacancies within MgO(Al) nanosheets. The resultant Pt1/MgO(Al) SAC displays an exceptional catalytic activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation&#8208;cyclization of 2&#8208;nitroacylbenzene, achieving a 97.5% yield at complete conversion and a record&#8208;breaking turnover frequency of 458.8 h&#8211;1 under the mild conditions. The synergistic catalysis between the fully exposed single&#8208;atom Pt sites within a unique Pt&#8208;O&#8208;Mg/Al moiety and the abundant basic sites of the MgO(Al) support is responsible for this outstanding catalytic performance. The current work, therefore, paves the way for developing bifunctional or multifunctional SACs that can enhance efficient organocatalytic conversions.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent Effect on Dative and Ionic Bond Strengths: A Unified Theory from Potential Analysis and Valence&#8208;Bond Computations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potential energy surface (PES) analysis is conducted to interpret the solvent&#8208;induced variations in the strengths of dative (Me3NBH3) and ionic (LiCl) bonds, which possess both ionic and covalent (neutral) characteristics, along the bond distances. The different responses of Me3NBH3 (blue&#8208;shifting) and LiCl (red&#8208;shifting) to solvation are subsequently examined with valence bond (VB) theory.







Abstract
Solvent molecules interact with a solute through various intermolecular forces. Here we employed a potential energy surface (PES) analysis to interpret the solvent&#8208;induced variations in the strengths of dative (Me3NBH3) and ionic (LiCl) bonds, which possess both ionic and covalent (neutral) characteristics. The change of a bond is driven by the gradient (force) of the solvent&#8208;solute interaction energy with respect to the focused bond length. Positive force shortens the bond length and increases the bond force constant, leading to a blue&#8208;shift of the bond stretching vibrational frequency upon solvation. Conversely, negative force elongates the bond, resulting in a reduced bond force constant and red&#8208;shift of the stretching vibrational frequency. The different responses of Me3NBH3 and LiCl to solvation are studied with valence bond (VB) theory, as Me3NBH3 and LiCl are dominated by the neutral covalent VB structure and the ionic VB structure, respectively. The dipole moment of an ionic VB structure increases along the increasing bond distance, while the dipole moment of a neutral covalent VB structure increases with the decreasing bond distance. The roles of the dominating VB structures are further examined by the geometry optimizations and frequency calculations with the block&#8208;localized wavefunction (BLW) method.

&lt;p&gt;Solvent molecules interact with a solute through various intermolecular forces. Here we employed a potential energy surface (PES) analysis to interpret the solvent-induced variations in the strengths of dative (Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NBH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and ionic (LiCl) bonds, which possess both ionic and covalent (neutral) characteristics. The change of a bond is driven by the gradient (force) of the solvent-solute interaction energy with respect to the focused bond length. Positive force shortens the bond length and increases the bond force constant, leading to a blue-shift of the bond stretching vibrational frequency upon solvation. Conversely, negative force elongates the bond, resulting in a reduced bond force constant and red-shift of the stretching vibrational frequency. The different responses of Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NBH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and LiCl to solvation are studied with valence bond (VB) theory, as Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NBH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and LiCl are dominated by the neutral covalent VB structure and the ionic VB structure, respectively. The dipole moment of an ionic VB structure increases along the increasing bond distance, while the dipole moment of a neutral covalent VB structure increases with the decreasing bond distance. The roles of the dominating VB structures are further examined by the geometry optimizations and frequency calculations with the block-localized wavefunction (BLW) method.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unveiling the Twisted Aromatic Donor Effect on the Nonlinear Response of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A Type Malononitrile&#8208;Derived Chromophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular structure modification by incorporating twisted aromatic donors into malononitrile&#8208;derived D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A chromophores results in diminished charge separation and intramolecular charge transfer, as demonstrated by the reduced nonlinear response compared to their planar counterparts.







Abstract
This study presents the design, synthesis, and comprehensive characterization of a novel series of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type malononitrile&#8208;derived chromophores, BTC&#8208;1&#8211;BTC&#8208;4. Combining various spectroscopic techniques, nonlinear Z&#8208;scan measurements, and quantum chemical calculations, we revealed the intricate relationship between nonlinear optical properties and the interplay of molecular structure, intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), and dipole moments (&#956;). Our experimental and computational findings corroborate that the polarization degree in the ground state, the charge separation in the excited state and twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) collectively dictate the nonlinear optical properties of the compounds. Notably, BTC&#8208;1 exhibits an exceptional nonlinear absorption coefficient &#946; value (2&#215;10&#8722;8&#8197;m&#8201;W&#8722;1), attributed to its optimized charge transfer efficiency and pronounced degree of charge separation. Our findings provide actionable insights for the rational design of high&#8208;performance organic Nonlinear optics (NLO) materials with potential applications in advanced photonic devices.

         <title>Intramolecular Cyclization and a Retro&#8208;Ene Reaction Enable the Rapid Fragmentation of a Vitamin B1&#8208;Derived Breslow Intermediate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new mechanism has been proposed to explain the rapid fragmentation of a thiamin&#8208;derived Breslow intermediate. Extensive DFT analyses demonstrate that the cyclization, thiazolium expulsion, and retro&#8208;ene reactions that comprise this mechanism provide a lower energy pathway to fragmentation than the currently accepted mechanism. This improved mechanistic understanding sheds light on how thiamin&#8208;dependent enzymes avoid cofactor fragmentation.







Abstract
In solution, analogues of the Breslow intermediate formed during catalysis by benzoylformate decarboxylase (BFDC) undergo rapid, irreversible fragmentation. The ability of BFDC to prevent this reaction and preserve its cofactor is a striking example of an enzyme &#8216;steering&#8217; a reactive intermediate towards a productive pathway. To understand how BFDC suppresses the off&#8208;pathway reactivity of this Breslow intermediate, a clear mechanistic understanding of the fragmentation reaction is required. Here, DFT calculations reveal an unexpected mechanism for the solution&#8208;phase fragmentation that involves an intramolecular cyclization and a subsequent retro&#8208;ene reaction to release the final products. Free energy profiles demonstrate that this pathway is significantly more facile than the previously proposed mechanism that invoked Breslow intermediate enolates as intermediates. Additional computations have been performed to understand why related Breslow intermediates do not undergo analogous fragmentation reactions. Calculations performed with two closely related Breslow intermediates suggest that subtle differences in the relative values of &#916;G&#8800; for protonation and fragmentation dictate whether a given intermediate will fragment or not. These differences and the fragmentation mechanism unveiled in this work may have ramifications for the mechanism of BFDC and other thiamin&#8208;dependent enzymes and could provide general lessons related to the control of reactive intermediates by enzymes.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Chain Hydrosilylation of Alkenes Enabled by Triplet Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light&#8208;triggered organophotocatalytic hydrosilylation of alkenes and alkynes, which proceeds via a triplet energy transfer (EnT)&#8208;enabled radical chain pathway, has been developed.







Abstract
Development of mild, robust and metal&#8208;free catalytic approach for the hydrosilylation of alkenes is critical to the advancement of modern organosilicon chemistry given their powerful capacity in the construction of various C&#8722;Si bonds. Herein, we wish to disclose a visible light&#8208;triggered organophotocatalytic strategy, which proceeds via a triplet energy transfer (EnT)&#8208;enabled radical chain pathway. Notably, this redox&#8208;neutral protocol is capable of accommodating a broad spectrum of electron&#8208;deficient and &#8208;rich alkenes with excellent functional group compatibility. Electron&#8208;deficient alkenes are more reactive and the reaction could be finished within a couple of minutes even in PBS solution with extremely low concentration, which suggests its click&#8208;like potential in organic synthesis. The preparative power of the transformations has been further highlighted in a number of complex settings, including the late&#8208;stage functionalization and scale&#8208;up experiments. Furthermore, although only highly reactive (TMS)3SiH is suitable hydrosilane substrate, our studies revealed the great reactivity and versatility of (TMS)3Si&#8722; group in diverse C&#8722;Si and Si&#8722;Si bond cleavage&#8208;based transformations, enabling the rapid introduction of diverse functional groups and the facile construction of valuable quaternary silicon architectures.

Photosynthesis is a complex multi&#8208;step process in which light collection is the initial step of photosynthesis and plays an important role in the efficiency of solar energy utilization. Here,we modified &#946;&#8208;CD with the donor molecule naphthalimide and adamantane with the tetraphenylethylene molecule which has aggregation&#8208;induced emission effects (AIE).

Abstract
Photosynthesis is a complex multi&#8208;step process in which light collection is the initial step of photosynthesis and plays an important role in the utilization of solar energy. In order to improve the utilization of sunlight, researchers have developed a variety of artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems to simulate photosynthesis in nature. Here, we report a supramolecular artificial light&#8208;harvesting system in aqueous solution. Since &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD) has a hydrophobic cavity and a hydrophilic outer surface, we adopt &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD) as the host molecule and use adamantane as the guest molecule. At the same time, we modified &#946;&#8208;CD with the donor molecule naphthalimide and adamantane with the tetraphenylethylene molecule which has aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effects. By using fluorescent molecules with AIE, the self&#8208;quenching effect caused by aggregation in aqueous solution can be effectively avoided. Due to the host&#8208;guest interaction of &#946;&#8208;CD and adamantane, nanoparticles with stable structure and uniform size can be spontaneously assembled in water. Because of the close distance and strong spectral overlap between naphthalimide and tetraphenylethylene, F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) was realized, and artificial light&#8208;harvesting system was successfully constructed in aqueous solution. Therefore, this study provides a new strategy for constructing artificial light&#8208;harvesting system, and the artificial light&#8208;harvesting system shows broad application prospects in aqueous solutions.

         <title>Waste Valorization in a Sustainable Bio&#8208;Based Economy: The Road to Carbon Neutrality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Important developments, over the last five decades, towards realization of sustainable chemicals manufacture, are discussed. They include the use of waste biomass and CO2 as a raw material, renewable electricity as the energy source and chemo&#8208; and biocatalysis, with whole cells or cell&#8208;free enzymes, including the use of electro(bio)catalysis and photo(bio)catalysis, as the facilitators.







Abstract
The development of sustainable chemistry underlying the quest to minimize and/or valorize waste in the carbon&#8208;neutral manufacture of chemicals is followed over the last four to five decades. Both chemo&#8208; and biocatalysis have played an indispensable role in this odyssey. in particular developments in protein engineering, metagenomics and bioinformatics over the preceding three decades have played a crucial supporting role in facilitating the widespread application of both whole cell and cell&#8208;free biocatalysis. The pressing need, driven by climate change mitigation, for a drastic reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, has precipitated an energy transition based on decarbonization of energy and defossilization of organic chemicals production. The latter involves waste biomass and/or waste CO2 as the feedstock and green electricity generated using solar, wind, hydroelectric or nuclear energy. The use of waste polysaccharides as feedstocks will underpin a renaissance in carbohydrate chemistry with pentoses and hexoses as base chemicals and bio&#8208;based solvents and polymers as environmentally friendly downstream products.

     alt="Waste Valorization in a Sustainable Bio-Based Economy: The Road to Carbon Neutrality"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important developments, over the last five decades, towards realization of sustainable chemicals manufacture, are discussed. They include the use of waste biomass and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a raw material, renewable electricity as the energy source and chemo- and biocatalysis, with whole cells or cell-free enzymes, including the use of electro(bio)catalysis and photo(bio)catalysis, as the facilitators.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of sustainable chemistry underlying the quest to minimize and/or valorize waste in the carbon-neutral manufacture of chemicals is followed over the last four to five decades. Both chemo- and biocatalysis have played an indispensable role in this odyssey. in particular developments in protein engineering, metagenomics and bioinformatics over the preceding three decades have played a crucial supporting role in facilitating the widespread application of both whole cell and cell-free biocatalysis. The pressing need, driven by climate change mitigation, for a drastic reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, has precipitated an energy transition based on decarbonization of energy and defossilization of organic chemicals production. The latter involves waste biomass and/or waste CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the feedstock and green electricity generated using solar, wind, hydroelectric or nuclear energy. The use of waste polysaccharides as feedstocks will underpin a renaissance in carbohydrate chemistry with pentoses and hexoses as base chemicals and bio-based solvents and polymers as environmentally friendly downstream products. The widespread availability of inexpensive electricity and solar energy has led to increasing attention for electro(bio)catalysis and photo(bio)catalysis which in turn is leading to myriad innovations in these fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cascade C&#8722;H Activation and Two C&#8722;C Bond Forming in Reaction of Azalutetacyclopentadiene with 2&#8208;Methylbenzonitriles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of azalutetacyclopentadiene toward 2&#8208;methylbenzonitriles provides a series of fused 7&#8211;5&#8208;6&#8208;membered azalutetacycle products. Mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction proceeds through three steps: the activation of the benzylic C&#8722;H bond, followed by the first intramolecular nucleophilic attack to form the first new C&#8722;C bond, and then the intramolecular nucleophilic attack of uncoordinated carbanion toward C=N triple bond. Two new C&#8722;C bonds are formed in the highly selective three&#8208;step cascade transformation.







Abstract
Azametallacyclopentadienes are an important class of metallacycles as the key intermediates in metal&#8208;promoted or catalyzed carbon&#8208;carbon coupling reaction of nitriles and alkynes. Rare&#8208;earth azametallacyclopentadienes have shown various reactivity toward nitriles, depending on the substituents of nitriles. The reaction of azalutetacyclopentadienes toward 2&#8208;methylbenzonitriles has been investigated in this work, which selectively affords the fused 7&#8208;5&#8208;6&#8208;membered azalutetacycles as products. Computational studies reveal that the reaction of azalutetacyclopentadienes toward 2&#8208;methylbenzonitriles selectively initiates with the remote activation of the benzylic C&#8722;H bond by the Lu&#8722;N bond, followed by the intramolecular nucleophilic attack from the deprotonated benzylic carbon to form a C&#8722;C bond. Subsequently, the high ring strain promoted the generation of the uncoordinated carbanion dissociated from the lutetium center, which then undergoes intramolecular nucleophilic attack toward C=N triple bond to give the final product containing fused 7&#8208;5&#8208;6&#8208;membered azalutetacycle. This work not only achieves highly selective three&#8208;step cascade reaction to form a unique class of rare&#8208;earth metallacycle, but also provides a new idea for the transformation of unsaturated substrates with C&#8722;H bonds that can be activated.

         <title>A BODIPY&#8208;Ferrocene Conjugate for the Combined Photodynamic Therapy and Chemodynamic Therapy with Improved Antitumor Efficiency</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A BODIPY&#8208;ferrocene conjugate with balanced 1O2 and &#8901;OH generation ability has been designed and synthesized. The as&#8208;prepared conjugate can significantly improve the intracellular ROS level of tumor cells by combining PDT and CDT at low drug doses, thus realizing the efficient tumor cells killing with a synergistic strategy.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) can destroy tumor cells by generating singlet oxygen (1O2) under light irradiation, which is limited by the hypoxia of the neoplastic tissue. Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) can produce toxic hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH) to eradicate tumor cells by catalytic decomposition of endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), the therapeutic effect of which is highly dependent on the concentration of H2O2. Herein, we propose a BODIPY&#8208;ferrocene conjugate with a balanced 1O2 and &#8901;OH generation capacity, which can serve as a high&#8208;efficiency antitumor agent by combining PDT and CDT. The ferrocene moieties endow the as&#8208;prepared conjugates with the ability of chemodynamic killing of tumor cells. Moreover, combined PDT/CDT therapy with improved antitumor efficiency can be realized after exposure to light irradiation. Compared with the monotherapy by PDT or CDT, the BODIPY&#8208;ferrocene conjugates can significantly increase the intracellular ROS levels of the tumor cells after light irradiation, thereby inducing the tumor cell apoptosis at low drug doses. In this way, a synergistic antitumor treatment is achieved by the combination of PDT and CDT.

         <title>Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Hyperbranched Polymer&#8208;Based Topological Supramolecular Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyperbranched polymer (HBP)&#8208;based supramolecular polymers (SPs) perfectly integrated the dynamic nature of SPs and the 3D topological features and multifunctionality of HBP polymers. The HBP&#8208;based SPs with fascinating topologies have aroused tremendous attention due to their structural novelty and attractive applications. This concept overviews the current progress on the construction and self&#8208;assembly of HBP&#8208;based SPs.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers (SPs) are constructed through non&#8208;covalent interactions. The dynamic or reversible nature of SPs endows them unique physical and chemical properties, such as self&#8208;adaptive and stimuli&#8208;response abilities. The topological structures of SPs play an important role in determining the physicochemical properties and functionality. Hyperbranched polymers (HBPs) are highly branched 3D macromolecules with linear, dendritic, and terminal units, which makes them versatile candidates for the construction of SPs with fascinating architectures. The resultant HBP&#8208;based SPs perfectly integrated the dynamic/reversible nature of SPs and the 3D topological features and multifunctionality of HBP polymers. To date, various types of HBP&#8208;based SPs and their assemblies have been constructed, and their potential applications have been explored as well. This article overviews the current progress on self&#8208;assembly of HBP&#8208;based SPs. The strategies for construction of HBP&#8208;based SPs and their assemblies are discussed. Typical potential applications of the assemblies of HBP&#8208;based SPs are also introduced.

         <dc:description>Sr4Ba3(BO3)3.83H2.5, as the second compound to combine borate and hydride ions, has been synthesized by a mechanochemical synthesis route. The structure has been elucidated by synchrotron X&#8208;ray and neutron diffraction and determined to crystallize in the non&#8208;centrosymmetric space group P63mc (186) with the cell parameters a = 10.87762(15) &#197; and c = 6.98061(11) &#197;. A detailed investigation of the compound by vibrational spectroscopy in combination with Density Functional Theory calculations reveals the disordered nature of the structure and proves the presence of both borate and hydride ions. Electronic band structure calculations predict a large band gap of 7.1 eV. Hydride states are predicted at the topmost valence band, which agrees well with earlier reported heteroanionic hydrides. We hereby were able to successfully apply previously synthetic and analytical schemes to introduce another member of the rare compounds that contain complex oxoanions simultaneously with hydride ions.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic two&#8208;photon&#8208;absorbing photosensitizers can overcome competing light absorption in organic photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional organic photocatalysis typically relies on ultraviolet and short&#8208;wavelength visible photons as the energy source. However, this approach often suffers from competing light absorption by reactants, products, intermediates, and co&#8208;catalysts, leading to reduced quantum efficiency and side reactions. To address this issue, we developed novel organic two&#8208;photon&#8208;absorbing (TPA) photosensitizers capable of functioning under deep red and near&#8208;infrared light irradiation. Three model reactions including cyclization, Sonogashira Csp2&#8208;Csp cross&#8208;coupling, and Csp2&#8208;N cross&#8208;coupling reactions were selected to compare the performance of the new photosensitizers under both blue (427 nm) and deep red (660 nm) light irradiation. The obtained results unambiguously prove that for reactions involving blue light&#8208;absorbing reactants, products, and/or co&#8208;catalysts, deep red light source resulted in better performance than blue light when utilizing our TPA photosensitizers. This work highlights the potential of our metal&#8208;free TPA photosensitizers as a sustainable and effective solution to mitigate the competing light absorption issue in photocatalysis, not only expanding the scope of organic photocatalysts but also reducing reliance on expensive Ru/Ir/Os&#8208;based photosensitizers.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Conventional organic photocatalysis typically relies on ultraviolet and short-wavelength visible photons as the energy source. However, this approach often suffers from competing light absorption by reactants, products, intermediates, and co-catalysts, leading to reduced quantum efficiency and side reactions. To address this issue, we developed novel organic two-photon-absorbing (TPA) photosensitizers capable of functioning under deep red and near-infrared light irradiation. Three model reactions including cyclization, Sonogashira Csp2-Csp cross-coupling, and Csp2-N cross-coupling reactions were selected to compare the performance of the new photosensitizers under both blue (427 nm) and deep red (660 nm) light irradiation. The obtained results unambiguously prove that for reactions involving blue light-absorbing reactants, products, and/or co-catalysts, deep red light source resulted in better performance than blue light when utilizing our TPA photosensitizers. This work highlights the potential of our metal-free TPA photosensitizers as a sustainable and effective solution to mitigate the competing light absorption issue in photocatalysis, not only expanding the scope of organic photocatalysts but also reducing reliance on expensive Ru/Ir/Os-based photosensitizers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Kinetic Resolution Polymerization of Racemic Lactide Mediated by Axial&#8208;Chiral Thiourea/Phosphazene Binary Organocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The simple and effective binary organocatalytic pairs, associating axial&#8208;chiral thiourea organocatalysts and phosphazene bases, allow for both high polymerization activity and moderate enantioselectivity (kD/kL=18.1) for the AKRP of rac&#8208;LA at room temperature, yielding semi&#8208;crystalline and metal&#8208;free stereoblock PLA with a melting temperature as high as 186&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Asymmetric kinetic resolution polymerization (AKRP) provides an ideal way to obtain highly isotactic polylactide (PLA) with superior thermal&#8208;mechanical properties from racemic lactide (rac&#8208;LA). However, the development of a new catalytic system with concurrent high activity and selectivity at ambient temperature remains a great callenge. Here, a series of simple and effective binary organocatalytic pairs containing axial&#8208;chiral thioureas and commercially available phosphazene bases were designed. These chiral binary organocatalytic pairs allow for both high polymerization activity and moderate enantioselectivity for AKRP of rac&#8208;LA at room temperature, yielding semi&#8208;crystalline and metal&#8208;free stereoblock PLA with a melting temperature as high as 186&#8201;&#176;C. The highest kinetic resolution coefficient (krel) of 8.5 at 47&#8201;% conversion was obtained, and D&#8208;LA was preferentially polymerized via kinetic resolution with a maximum selectivity factor (kD/kL) of 18.1, indicating that an enantiomorphic site control mechanism (ESC) was involved.

         <title>The Hydronaphthalide Monoanion: Isolation of the &#8220;red transient&#8221; Birch Intermediate from liquid Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the isolation and full characterisation of a reactive intermediate from the Birch reduction which was first observed in 1939.The historically as transient described compound was isolated as an organic salt from the reaction of naphthalene, sodium, and tetramethylammonium chloride in liquid ammonia. The trapped intermediate demonstrates a tamed reduction potential enabling higher reaction control compared to stronger reducing agents.







Abstract
Birch reactions employing alkali metals in ammonia have been a well&#8208;established method for the reduction and functionalisation of aromatic compounds for nearly 100&#8197;years. Speculations regarding intermediates in the reaction pathway have been discussed since the beginning. We hereby report the isolation of NMe4(HNaph) (1), a kinetically trapped intermediate of the Birch reaction of naphthalene and sodium in liquid ammonia. 1 has been fully characterised and has been shown to continue to react to 1,2/1,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalene &#8211; the Birch product of the reduction of naphthalene. The reactivity of 1 was investigated towards activity as an electron and hydride transfer agent with both, elements and small organic molecules. 1 demonstrates a tamed reduction potential which allows for controlled reactions such as the selective formation of hexasulphide and hexaselenide anions.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding in Selective Recognition and Liquid&#8208;Liquid Extraction of Perrhenate</title>

Potent tetrapodal Se&#8208;based ChB receptors selectively extract ReO4&#8722; from 100&#8201;% water medium, employing both precipitation and LLE method.







Abstract
Efficient recognition and extraction of hazardous anionic pollutants from water medium is of great significance for environmental concerns, representing a challenging area of research in supramolecular chemistry. In this study, we present, for the first time, a comprehensive demonstration of the ability of chalcogen bonding (ChB) to recognize and remove the ReO4&#8722; from 100&#8201;% water medium. The anion recognition ability is well elucidated through solution phase NMR and ITC studies, which clearly reveal the selective binding of ReO4&#8722; over other oxo&#8208;anions. Moreover, the selenoimidazolium scaffold effectively engages in Se&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O ChB interaction with ReO4&#8722; as confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystal structure and XPS analysis. More importantly, the binding of ReO4&#8722; with different prolongations of the &#963;&#8211;holes, along with Se&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;Se chalcogen bonding interactions, lead to the formation of a 1D supramolecular assembly. Eventually, ChB receptor Se4Me&#8722;Br exhibits ~62&#8201;% ReO4&#8722; extraction efficiency through precipitation as the extraction method. Furthermore, in efforts to enhance efficiency, a hydrophobic ChB receptor Se4Do&#8208;PF6 has been prepared, achieving an efficiency of up to ~93&#8201;% at a very low concentration (~5&#8197;ppm) by liquid&#8208;liquid extraction.

         <title>Tuning Energetics of 2&#8201;e&#8722;/2H+ PCET Properties with Model Ru&#8208;bisamido Complexes</title>

Fine&#8208;tuning of electronic structures allows control over energetic parameters in a family of complexes that undergo multi&#8208;redox 2e&#8722;/2H+ processes. The orbital overlap gives structural energy stabilization for potential inversion.







Abstract
Most redox processes that break/form bonds involve net 2e&#8722; changes, and many are coupled to protons. Yet most proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) studies focus on 1e&#8722;/1H+ reactions. Reported here is a family of molecular models that undergo tunable 2e&#8722;/2H+ redox changes. Complexes [(X2bpy)RuII(en*)2](PF6)2 and [(X2bpy)RuIV(en*&#8208;H)2](PF6)2 have been synthesized with bpy=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine with 4,4&#8217;&#8208;subtitutions X=&#8722;NMe2, &#8722;OMe, &#8722;Me, &#8722;H, &#8722;CF3; and en*=2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;butanediamine. They have been characterized by IR, UV&#8208;vis, and NMR spectroscopies, XRD, electrochemistry, mass spectrometry, DFT and (TD)DFT computations. The introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing and donating groups at the 4,4&#8217;&#8208;position of the bpy ligand affects the complexes&#8217; redox potentials, pKa&#8217;s, and Bond Dissociation Free Energies (BDFEs) of the N&#8722;H bonds in the en* ligands. The average BDFEs for the overall 2e&#8722;/2H+ PCET span over 5&#8197;kcal/mol. Notably, these complexes all show marked potential inversion over an extended range, &#916;pKa&gt;25&#8197;units and &#916;E0&gt;1.4&#8197;V. Potential inversion remains despite the electronic influence of bpy's substitutions which regulate N&#8722;H properties several bonds apart by trans&#8208;effect over d&#960;&#8208;molecular orbitals at the Ru center. The experimental and computational results presented in this work support the presence of strong coupling between electrons and protons, for modelling insights of 2e&#8722;/2H+ transfer reactivity.

Potential inversion remains despite the electronic influence of bpy's substitutions which regulate N&#8722;H properties several bonds apart by trans-effect over d&#960;-molecular orbitals at the Ru center. The experimental and computational results presented in this work support the presence of strong coupling between electrons and protons, for modelling insights of 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transfer reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Energy&#8208;Transfer Enabled Divergent Synthesis of Polycyclic &#947;&#8208;Sultines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced energy transfer enabled procedure for the construction of otherwise challenging&#8208;to&#8208;access polycyclic sultine derivatives has been discovered. The reaction demonstrates good functional group compatibility, mild reaction conditions, excellent diastereoselectivity, and scalable.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;initiated energy&#8208;transfer enabled radical cyclization for the divergent synthesis of polycyclic &#947;&#8208;sultine derivatives has been developed. The reaction provides an alternative and expeditious access to benzofused &#947;&#8208;sultine frameworks, the analogues of &#947;&#8208;lactones and &#947;&#8208;sultones, and features good functional group compatibility, mild reaction conditions and excellent diastereoselectivity. The robustness and application potential of this method have also been successfully displayed by two gram&#8208;scale reactions and the synthesis of polycyclic sultones. Mechanistic studies indicated the transformations through a possible energy&#8208;transfer enabled intramolecular radical homolytic substitution or hydrogen atom transfer process mainly.

         <title>The Strategies Towards Electrochemical Generation of Aryl Radicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical generation of aryl radicals from various precursors has attracted significant attention due to their high reactivity in forming multiple chemical bonds. This review summarizes recent advancements by categorizing the aryl radical precursors into five key types: (1) aryl diazonium salts, (2) aryl halides, (3) aryl (sulfonyl)hydrazines, (4) aryl quaternary arylammonium salts, and (5) other aryl radical precursors.







Abstract
The advancement in electrochemical techniques has unlocked a new path for achieving unprecedented oxidations and reductions of aryl radical precursors in a controlled and selective manner. This approach facilitates the construction of aromatic carbon&#8722;carbon and carbon&#8722;heteroatom bonds. In light of the green merits and the growing importance of this technique in aryl radical chemistry, this review aims to provide an overview of the recent advance in the electrochemical generation of aryl radicals organized by the aryl radical precursor type, with a focus on the substrate scope, limitation, and underlying mechanism, thereby inspiring future work on electrochemical aryl radical generation.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Induced Fluorescence Switching in Azine&#8208;Containing Fluorophores Displaying Resonance&#8208;Stabilized ESIPT Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis, structural and photophysical characterization of azaheterocycles&#8208;functionalized 2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)benzazole derivatives showing dual&#8208;state emission properties are described. Their stimuli&#8208;sensitive (acid, cations) response is also scrutinized with the support of ab initio calculations.







Abstract
This article reports the synthesis, along with structural and photophysical characterization of 2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)benzazole derivatives functionalized with various azaheterocycles (pyridine, pyrimidine, terpyridine). These compounds show dual&#8208;state emission properties, that is intense fluorescence both in solution and in the solid&#8208;state with a range of fluorescent color going from blue to orange. Moreover, the nature of their excited state can be tuned by the presence of external stimuli such as protons or metal cations. In the absence of stimuli, these dyes show emission stemming from anionic species obtained after deprotonation (D* transition), whereas upon protonation or metal chelation, ESIPT process occurs leading to a stabilized and highly emissive K* transition. With the help of extensive ab initio calculations, we confirm that external stimuli can switch the nature of the transitions, making this series of dyes attractive candidates for the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent ratiometric probes.

         <title>Stable Antiaromatic [16]Triphyrin(2.1.1) with Core Modification: Synthesis Using a 16&#960; Electrocyclic Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antiaromatic porphyrinoids have attracted significant attention owing to their unique electronic properties and potential applications. However, synthesis of antiaromatic contracted porphyrinoids is challenging owing to the inherent instability associated with smaller ring sizes. In this study, we report the synthesis and characterization of the first stable trioxa[16]triphyrin(2.1.1), a novel 16&#960; antiaromatic contracted porphyrinoid. We utilized a core modification approach to stabilize the [16]triphyrin(2.1.1). X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis revealed a nearly planar structure. Electrochemical studies demonstrated reversible oxidation behavior and a small HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, which was consistent with its antiaromatic nature. Chemical oxidation yielded an aromatic [14]triphyrin(2.1.1) dication, highlighting the antiaromaticity&#8211;aromaticity switching capability of this system. This synthesis involved the discovery of a key intermediate, dihydrotrioxatriphyrin(2.1.1), which underwent oxidative dehydrogenation to yield the target compound. Theoretical calculations suggested that dihydrotrioxatriphyrin(2.1.1) formed via a rare 16&#960; electrocyclic reaction. The successful synthesis and characterization of this stable trioxa[16]triphyrin(2.1.1) underscores the potential of the core modification strategies for the rational design of novel antiaromatic systems with tunable properties. Moreover, the discovery of the rare 16&#960; electrocyclic reaction advances the understanding of high&#8208;order pericyclic processes and may inspire new synthetic strategies for complex macrocyclic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Catalytic Metal&#8208;Based Homogeneous&#8208;Heterogeneous Systems in Organic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this concept article we provide examples where metal&#8208;based homogeneous and heterogeneous multi&#8208;catalytic systems cooperate to provide advantages over conventional catalytic systems, such as higher compatibility or increased sustainability. This simple, yet powerful strategy has an untapped potential to address important challenges in organic chemistry.







Abstract
The combination of metal&#8208;based homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts in the same reaction media is a powerful, yet relatively unexplored approach in organic chemistry. This strategy can address important limitations associated with purely homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysis such as the incompatibility of different catalytic species in solution, or the limited tunability of solid catalysts, respectively. Moreover, the facile reusability of the solid catalyst, contributes to increase the overall sustainability of the process. As a result, this semi&#8208;heterogeneous multi&#8208;catalytic approach has unlocked significant advances in organic chemistry, improving existing reactions and even enabling the discovery of novel transformations, exemplified by the formal alkane metathesis. This concept article aims to showcase the benefits of this strategy through the exploration of diverse relevant examples from the literature, hoping to spur research on new metal&#8208;based homogeneous&#8208;heterogeneous catalyst combinations that will result in reactivity challenging to achieve by conventional homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysis alone.

         <title>Contact Electrification as an Emerging Strategy for Controlling the Performance of Metal Nanoparticle Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As modern technology enters the era of nanomaterials, the contact electrification, as a classic physical phenomenon, brings new ideas for studying the interactions between metal nanoparticles. The study of contact electrification phenomenon by classical theory shows that the Fermi level of materials before and after contact changes. This conclusion is further confirmed by modern characterization techniques, and this change in the Fermi level of materials is reflected in the field of catalysis, which can regulate the performance of catalysts in catalytic reactions.







Abstract
Contact electrification (CE) is an emerging strategy for controlling the performance of metal nanoparticle (NP) catalysts. The underlying physical principle of this control is the sensitivity of the Fermi level to metal&#8208;metal contacts. This change in electronic structure has a direct impact on surface properties and chemical reactivity. The concept article briefly introduces the basic theory of CE and its relationship to catalytic performance. We then highlight selected recent examples of advances in the preparation of hybrid metal NP assemblies, experimental techniques for characterizing CE, and finally applications of CE for altering catalytic performance.

         <title>Highly Graphitized Coal Tar Pitch&#8208;Derived Porous Carbon as High&#8208;Performance Lithium Storage Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report that excellent porous carbon materials are obtained by modulating different proportions of coal tar pitch and nano&#8208;calcium carbonate powder (CTP&#8722;X). CTP&#8208;2 exhibits excellent cycling and multiplication performance when used as an anode for LIBs, and is expected to be used as an electrode material for the next generation LIBs.







Abstract
Because of its high specific capacity and superior rate performance, porous carbon is regarded as a potential anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, porous carbon materials with wide pore diameter distributions suffer from low structural stability and low electrical conductivity during the application process. During this study, the calcium carbonate nanoparticle template method is used to prepare coal tar pitch&#8208;derived porous carbon (CTP&#8722;X). The coal tar pitch&#8208;derived porous carbon has a well&#8208;developed macroporous&#8208;mesoporous&#8208;microporous hierarchical porous network structure, which provides abundant active sites for Li+ storage, significantly reduces polarization and charge transfer resistance, shortens the diffusion path and promotes the rapid transport of Li+. More specifically, the CTP&#8208;2 anode shows high charge capacity (496.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1), excellent rate performance (413.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1), and high cycling stability (capacity retention rate of about 100&#8201;% after 1,000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). The clean and eco&#8208;friendly large&#8208;scale utilization of coal tar pitch will facilitate the development of high&#8208;performance anodes in the field of LIBs.

         <title>Covalently Linked 5,6,11,12&#8208;Tetraazanaphthacene Dimer and Its Triptycene&#8208;Capped Derivatives as Electron Acceptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>

Triptycene end&#8208;capped bi&#8208;tetraazaacene (bi&#8208;TpTANC) was synthesised with good solubility, rigidity, and crystallinity, and was characterised using X&#8208;ray crystallography. Bi&#8208;TpTANC is a multi&#8208;electron acceptor with a 3&#8208;step/4&#8208;electron transfer mechanism, and its electrochemistry suggests through&#8208;bond charge delocalisation in its monoanionic state. With a LUMO level of &#8722;4.1&#8197;eV, bi&#8208;TpTANC is expected to be an air stable electron acceptor or an n&#8208;type semiconductor.







Abstract
The development of electron transport and n&#8208;type materials is still largely dominated by a limited number of organic semiconductors, with fullerenes at the forefront. In contrast, substantial progress has been made in developing hole transport and p&#8208;type materials. Therefore, expanding the range of electron acceptors, making them solution&#8208;processable, and elucidating their structural arrangement by X&#8208;ray crystallography is essential. We synthesised 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bi&#8208;(5,6,11,12&#8208;tetraazanaphthacene) (bi&#8208;TANC) and its triptycene end&#8208;capped derivative, 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bi(8,13&#8208;dihydro&#8208;8,13&#8208;[1,2]benzenonaphtho&#8208;5,6,15,16&#8208;tetraazanaphthacene) (bi&#8208;TpTANC), as electron acceptors. Bi&#8208;TANC exhibits a herringbone&#8208;like crystal packing with intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; overlap, which is observed in typical organic n&#8208;type semiconductors. However, it showed poor solubility, similar to larger acenes. In contrast, bi&#8208;TpTANC exhibited favourable solubility, and its electrochemistry in solution was investigated. In the cyclic voltammogram of bi&#8208;TpTANC, reversible redox waves corresponding to 3&#8208;step/4&#8208;electron transfer were observed at &#8722;0.795&#8197;V (1e&#8722;), &#8722;0.927&#8197;V (1e&#8722;), and &#8722;1.44&#8197;V (2e&#8722;) as half&#8208;wave potentials. The redox wave associated with the two&#8208;electron transfer on the negative low&#8208;potential side indicates the presence of through&#8208;bond charge delocalisation in the monoanionic state. Furthermore, the LUMO level of bi&#8208;TpTANC is &#8722;4.1&#8197;eV, which indicates its potential as a promising air&#8208;stable n&#8208;type material.

         <title>Probing Basal and Prismatic Planes of Graphitic Materials for Metal Single Atom and Subnanometer Cluster Stabilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The detection of small quantities of metal clusters in single atom catalysts remains a challenge even when combining electron microscopy (EM), X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results obtained demonstrate that Rh single atoms are mainly present on materials presenting prismatic surface, and that catalysis itself constitutes a valuable tool for the characterization of these materials.







Abstract
Supported metal single atom catalysis is a dynamic research area in catalysis science combining the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. Understanding the interactions between metal single atoms and the support constitutes a challenge facing the development of such catalysts, since these interactions are essential in optimizing the catalytic performance. For conventional carbon supports, two types of surfaces can contribute to single atom stabilization: the basal planes and the prismatic surface; both of which can be decorated by defects and surface oxygen groups. To date, most studies on carbon&#8208;supported single atom catalysts focused on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons, which, unlike classic carbon materials, have a fairly well&#8208;defined chemical environment. Herein we report the synthesis, characterization and modeling of rhodium single atom catalysts supported on carbon materials presenting distinct concentrations of surface oxygen groups and basal/prismatic surface area. The influence of these parameters on the speciation of the Rh species, their coordination and ultimately on their catalytic performance in hydrogenation and hydroformylation reactions is analyzed. The results obtained show that catalysis itself is an interesting tool for the fine characterization of these materials, for which the detection of small quantities of metal clusters remains a challenge, even when combining several cutting&#8208;edge analytical methods.

The cyanine/AuNP pegilated hybrids can be dissolved in water/alcohol mixtures to give nanoinks, whose printouts display two photothermally responsive absorption bands, that give different T increases when laser&#8208;irradiated.







Abstract
Following a new approach, we prepared a nanoink with two separate photothermally responsive absorption bands. One is the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) absorption of gold nanoparticles (AuNP, d=17&#8197;nm), the second is the absorption band of two cyanine (Cy) dyes, Cy7&#8208;C6 or Cy7&#8208;C11, grafted to the AuNP surface through thiolated bridges of different lengths: the close proximity to the Au surface induces full quenching of the Cy fluorescence, resulting in thermal relaxation on irradiation. Attempts to full coat AuNP with the lipophilic Cy7&#8208;C6 and Cy7&#8208;C11 lead to precipitation from aqueous solutions. We thus prepared AuNP with partial pegylation (30, 50, or 70&#8201;%), using a long chain thiol&#8208;terminated PEG bearing a &#8208;COOH function. Addition until saturation of either Cy7&#8208;C6 or Cy7&#8208;C11 to the partially pegylated AuNP gave the AuNP@Cy/PEGX% hybrids (X=30, 50, 70) that are stable in water and in the water/alcohol mixtures used to prepare the nanoinks. Further overcoating of AuNP@Cy7&#8208;C6/PEG50&#8201;% with PAH (polyallylamine hydrochloride) avoids LSPR hybridization in the dry nanoink printouts, that present two separate bands. When irradiated with laser sources near their absorption maxima, the printouts of the AuNP@Cy7&#8208;C6/PEG50&#8201;%@PAH nanoink respond on two channels, giving different temperature increases depending on the irradiation wavelengths. This enhances the potentiality of use of these nanoinks for photothermal anticounterfait printouts, making more difficult to reproduce the correct &#916;T vs &#955;irradiation output.

         <title>Monomeric Fe(III)&#8208;Hydroxo and Fe(III)&#8208;Aqua Complexes Display Oxidative Asynchronous Hydrogen Atom Abstraction Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents the lipoxygenase&#8208;like activity of monomeric [FeIII(L5R)(OH)]1+ and [FeIII(L5R)(OH2)]2+ complexes (R=OMe, H, Cl, NO2), employing linoleic acid as a substrate. The rate&#8208;limiting step involves hydrogen atom transfer from linoleic acid to the &#8220;FeIII&#8722;OH&#8220;/&#8221;FeIII&#8722;OH2&#8220; complexes via an oxidative asynchronous concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer (CPET) pathway. The higher degree of asynchronicity in CPET within aqua complexes enhances the rate by approximately five&#8208;fold compared to hydroxo analogs.







Abstract
This paper presents the synthesis and characterization of a series of novel monomeric aqua&#8208;ligated iron(III) complexes, [FeIII(L5R)(OH2)]2+ (R=OMe, H, Cl, NO2), supported by an amide&#8208;containing pentadentate N5 donor ligand, L5R [HL5R=2&#8208;(((1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methyl)(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;methyl)amino)&#8208;N&#8208;(5&#8208;R&#8208;quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)acetamide]. The complexes were characterized by various spectroscopic and analytical techniques, including electrochemistry and magnetic measurements. The Fe(III)&#8208;hydroxo complexes, [FeIII(L5R)(OH)]1+, were generated in&#8197;situ by deprotonating the corresponding aqua complexes in a pH ~7 aqueous medium. In another way, adding one equivalent of a base to a methanolic solution of the Fe(III)&#8208;aqua complexes also produced the Fe(III)&#8208;hydroxo complexes. The study uses linoleic fatty acid as a substrate to explore the hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) reactivity of both hydroxo and aqua complexes. The investigation highlights the substitution effect of the L5R ligand on reactivity, revealing a higher rate when an electron&#8208;withdrawing group is present. Hammett analyses and(or) determination of the asynchronicity factor (&#951;) suggest an oxidative asynchronous concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer (CPET) pathway for the HAA reactions. Aqua complexes exhibited a higher asynchronicity in CPET, resulting in higher reaction rates than their hydroxo analogs. Overall, the work provides insights into the beneficial role of a higher imbalance in electron&#8208;transfer&#8208;proton&#8208;transfer (ET&#8208;PT) contributions in HAA reactivity.

         <title>A Hydrogen Bonded Non&#8208;Porous Organic&#8208;Inorganic Framework for Measuring Cysteine in Blood Plasma and Endogenous Cancer Cell</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reports the synthesis of a non&#8208;luminescent one&#8208;dimensional hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic&#8208;inorganic framework (HOIF) of Cu(II) and its affinity studies with cysteine. Cysteine measurement by HOIF has been validated using a commercial dye, &#8220;Cysteine Green&#8221;. The probe is suitable for measuring cysteine in plasma and bio&#8208;imaging endogenous cysteine in cancer cells.







Abstract
An imbalance in cysteine (Cys) levels in the cells and plasma has been identified as the risk indicator for various human diseases. The structural similarity of cysteine with its congener homocysteine and glutathione offers challenges in its measurement. Herein, we report a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic&#8208;inorganic framework of Cu(II) (HOIF) for the selective detection of cysteine over other biothiols. The non&#8208;fluorescent HOIF showed 12&#8208;fold green emission in the presence of cysteine. The monomeric unit of HOIF is stabilized via intermolecular hydrogen bonds, resulting in a non&#8208;porous network structure. Non&#8208;interference from homocysteine, glutathione, and other competitive bio&#8208;analytes revealed explicit affinity of HOIF for cysteine. Fluorimetric titration showed a wide working concentration window (650&#8197;nM&#8211;800&#8197;&#956;M) for measuring cysteine in an aqueous medium. The mechanistic investigation involving HRMS, EPR, and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopic studies revealed the decomplexation of HOIF with Cys, resulting in a fluorescence turn&#8208;on response from the luminescent ligand. Validation using a commercial dye, &#8220;Cysteine Green&#8221;, confirmed the prospect of HOIF for early diagnostic purposes. Utilizing the fluorescence turn&#8208;on property of HOIF in the presence of cysteine, we measured cysteine quantitatively in the blood plasma samples. Bio&#8208;imaging of endogenous cysteine in cancer cells indicated the ability of HOIF to monitor the intracellular cysteine.

         <title>Targeted Endoperoxides Delivering Singlet Oxygen to Cancer Cell Mitochondria: Exploration of the Therapeutic Potential</title>

Controlled and targeted generation of singlet oxygen in tumor tissues is poised to evolve into a viable therapeutic approach for cancer which does not require light or oxygen.







Abstract
The clinical practice of photodynamic therapy of cancer (PDT) is mostly limited to superficial types of cancer. The major reason behind this limited applicability is the need for light in the photogeneration of ROS, and in particular singlet oxygen. In order to circumvent this major roadblock, we designed and synthesized naphthalene&#8208;derived endoperoxides with mitochondria targeting triphenylphosphonium moieties. Here, we show that these compounds release singlet oxygen by thermal cycloreversion, and initiate cell death with IC50&lt;10&#8197;&#956;M in cancer cell cultures. The mouse 4T1 breast tumor model study, where the endoperoxide compound was introduced intraperitoneally, also showed highly promising results, with negligible systemic toxicity. Targeted delivery of singlet oxygen to cancer cell mitochondria could be the breakthrough needed to transform Photodynamic Therapy into a broadly applicable methodology for cancer treatment by keeping the central tenet and discarding problematic dependencies on oxygen or external light.

         <title>A Novel Fluorescent Gemcitabine Prodrug That Follows a Nucleoside Transporter&#8208;Independent Internalization and Bears Enhanced Therapeutic Efficacy With Respect to Gemcitabine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescent prodrug, named GF, based on gemcitabine and 5(6)&#8208;carboxyfluorescein was developed in a single step. GF follows a nucleoside transporter&#8208;independent endocytosis internalization mechanism, surpassing a key resistance mechanism against gemcitabine. Its pharmacokinetic profile and drug release efficiency were evaluated in mice, and eventually its visualization was achieved in zebrafish and its tumor inhibition was monitored in A549 xenografted mice.







Abstract
The multiplexity of cancer has rendered it the second leading cause of mortality worldwide and theragnostic prodrugs have gained popularity in recent years as a means of treatment. Theragnostic prodrugs enable the simultaneous diagnosis and therapy of tumors via high&#8208;precision real&#8208;time drug release monitoring. Herein, we report the development of the small theragnostic prodrug GF, based on the nucleoside anticancer agent gemcitabine and the fluorescent dye 5(6)&#8208;carboxyfluorescein. We have successfully demonstrated its efficient internalization in tumor cells, showing localization throughout both the early and late endocytic pathways. Its mechanism of cell internalization was evaluated, confirming its independence from nucleoside transporters. Its cellular localization via confocal microscopy revealed a clathrin&#8208;mediated endocytosis mechanism, distinguishing it from analogous compounds studied previously. Furthermore, GF exhibited stability across various pH values and in human blood plasma. Subsequently, its in&#8197;vitro cytotoxicity was assessed in three human cancer cell lines (A549, U87 and T98). Additionally, its pharmacokinetic profile in mice was investigated and the consequent drug release was monitored. Finally, its in&#8197;vivo visualization was accomplished in zebrafish xenotransplantation models and its in&#8197;vivo efficacy was evaluated in A549 xenografts. The results unveiled an intriguing efficacy profile, positioning GF as a compelling candidate warranting further investigation.

         <title>Isolation, Structure Elucidation, and Biological Activity of the Selective TACR2 Antagonist Tumonolide and its Aldehyde from a Marine Cyanobacterium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes the isolation of tumonolide and its aldehyde from a marine cyanobacterium. The relative and absolute stereochemistry of tumonolide were determined utilizing various spectroscopic and computational methods. Functional screening against a GPCR panel, molecular docking and global profiling using RNA sequencing provided the biological profile of tumonolide.







Abstract
The macrocyclic tumonolide (1) with enamide functionality and the linear tumonolide aldehyde (2) are new interconverting natural products from a marine cyanobacterium with a peptide&#8208;polyketide skeleton, representing a hybrid of apratoxins and palmyrolides or laingolides. The planar structures were established by NMR and mass spectrometry. The relative configuration of the stereogenically&#8208;rich apratoxin&#8208;like polyketide portion was determined using J&#8208;based configuration analysis. The absolute configuration of tumonolide (1) was determined by chiral analysis of the amino acid units and computational methods, followed by NMR chemical shift and ECD spectrum prediction, indicating all&#8208;R configuration for the polyketide portion, as in palmyrolide A and contrary to the all&#8208;S configuration in apratoxins. Functional screening against a panel of 168 GPCR targets revealed tumonolide (1) as a selective antagonist of TACR2 with an IC50 of 7.0&#8197;&#956;M, closely correlating with binding affinity. Molecular docking studies established the binding mode and rationalized the selectivity for TACR2 over TACR1 and TACR3. RNA sequencing upon treatment of HCT116 colorectal cancer cells demonstrated activation of the pulmonary fibrosis idiopathic signaling pathway and the insulin secretion signaling pathway at 20&#8197;&#956;M, indicating its potential to modulate these pathways.

         <title>The Influence of Disulfide, Thioacetal and Lanthionine&#8208;Bridges on the Conformation of a Macrocyclic Peptide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Does the bridge matter? We have compared the solution conformations of lanthionine, disulfide and thioacetal&#8208;bridged cyclic analogues of angiotensin(1&#8211;7). Despite the different bridging structures, the major conformations are found to be conserved for the macrocyclic core.







Abstract
Cyclisation of peptides by forming thioether (lanthionine), disulfide (cystine) or methylene thioacetal bridges between side chains is established as an important tool to stabilise a given structure, enhance metabolic stability and optimise both potency and selectivity. However, a systematic comparative study of the effects of differing bridging modalities on peptide conformation has not previously been carried out. In this paper, we have used the NMR deconvolution algorithm, NAMFIS, to determine the conformational ensembles, in aqueous solution, of three cyclic analogues of angiotensin(1&#8211;7), incorporating either disulfide, or non&#8208;reducible thioether or methylene thioacetal bridges. We demonstrate that the major solution conformations are conserved between the different bridged peptides, but the distribution of conformations differs appreciably. This suggests that subtle differences in ring size and bridging structure can be exploited to fine&#8208;tune the conformational properties of cyclic peptides, which may modulate their bioactivities.

         <title>Photoinduced Transition&#8208;Metal and External Photosensitizer Free Benzylic Fluorination of Unactivated Alkylarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalytic monofluorination of unactivated alkylarenes, potentially initiated via a single&#8208;electron transfer, offers a highly efficient and selective pathway with excellent substrate compatibility, enabling the scale&#8208;up synthesis of pharmaceutical molecules. Omitting transition&#8208;metal catalysts and photosensitizers simplifies late&#8208;stage drug modification and the purification process.







Abstract
A green and efficient protocol for the direct monofluorination of unactivated alkylarenes under visible&#8208;light irradiation has been developed, without any extraneous transition&#8208;metal catalysts or photosensitizers. This method is compatible with a broad spectrum of functional groups, including carboxylic and alcoholic scaffolds, under mild reaction conditions. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis of a fluorine&#8208;containing pharmaceutical analogue was successfully executed, underscoring the strategy's reliability and practicality. Furthermore, mechanistic studies suggest that a single&#8208;electron transfer mechanism might be responsible for the generation of the benzylic radicals in initiation step.

         <title>Exploring the Esterase Catalytic Activity of Minimalist Heptapeptide Amyloid Fibers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The esterase activity of minimalist amyloid fibers, made up of seven&#8208;residue peptides IHIHIHI and IHIHIQI, is examined using computational techniques. Contrary to initial assumptions, computational simulations reveal that the twist angle of the fiber is not notably influenced by the sixth residue, the reduction in the energy barrier when Gln is present being attributed to the formation of hydrogen bonds with the substrate.







Abstract
This paper investigates the esterase activity of minimalist amyloid fibers composed of short seven&#8208;residue peptides, IHIHIHI (IH7) and IHIHIQI (IH7Q), with a particular focus on the role of the sixth residue position within the peptide sequence. Through computational simulations and analyses, we explore the molecular mechanisms underlying catalysis in these amyloid&#8208;based enzymes. Contrary to initial hypotheses, our study reveals that the twist angle of the fiber, and thus the catalytic site's environment, is not notably affected by the sixth residue. Instead, the sixth residue interacts with the p&#8208;nitrophenylacetate (pNPA) substrate, particularly through its &#8722;NO2 group, potentially enhancing catalysis. Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations of the reaction mechanism suggest that the polarizing effect of glutamine enhances catalytic activity by forming a stabilizing network of hydrogen bonds with pNPA, leading to lower energy barriers and a more exergonic reaction. Our findings provide valuable insights into the intricate interplay between peptide sequence, structural arrangement, and catalytic function in amyloid&#8208;based enzymes, offering potentially valuable information for the design and optimization of biomimetic catalysts.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper investigates the esterase activity of minimalist amyloid fibers composed of short seven-residue peptides, IHIHIHI (IH7) and IHIHIQI (IH7Q), with a particular focus on the role of the sixth residue position within the peptide sequence. Through computational simulations and analyses, we explore the molecular mechanisms underlying catalysis in these amyloid-based enzymes. Contrary to initial hypotheses, our study reveals that the twist angle of the fiber, and thus the catalytic site's environment, is not notably affected by the sixth residue. Instead, the sixth residue interacts with the p-nitrophenylacetate (pNPA) substrate, particularly through its &#8722;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group, potentially enhancing catalysis. Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations of the reaction mechanism suggest that the polarizing effect of glutamine enhances catalytic activity by forming a stabilizing network of hydrogen bonds with pNPA, leading to lower energy barriers and a more exergonic reaction. Our findings provide valuable insights into the intricate interplay between peptide sequence, structural arrangement, and catalytic function in amyloid-based enzymes, offering potentially valuable information for the design and optimization of biomimetic catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This report presents an environmentally benign synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazines through an iodide&#8208;catalyzed electro&#8208;oxidative skeletal editing of 3&#8208;aminoindazoles. The method uses electrochemically generated reactive iodide species without involving any transition metal catalysts and peroxides. This mild reaction protocol exhibits a wide substrate scope with brad synthetic applicability. Detailed mechanistic studies elucidate a N&#8208;centered [1,2]&#8208;rearrangement as the key reaction step.







Abstract
This report describes an environmentally benign synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazines through an iodide&#8208;catalyzed electro&#8208;oxidative N&#8208;centered [1,2]&#8208;rearrangement of 3&#8208;aminoindazoles. The developed method demonstrates the activation of heteroatoms via electrochemically generated reactive iodide species without using any metal catalysts and peroxides. The protocol features practical and mild reaction conditions and displays a wide substrate scope. Various mechanistic experiments and cyclic voltammetric studies have been instrumental in elucidating the reaction mechanism, operating via a skeletal rearrangement of 3&#8208;aminoindazoles.

         <title>Gold Nanoclusters Whose Photoluminescent Properties are Dynamically Tunable by Modulating the Assembly Pathway Complexity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>

The Gold nanoclusters (DPT&#8208;AuNCs) could self&#8208;assembles into two distinct aggregation structures in MeOH/water mixed solvent, exhibiting pathway complexity with different photoluminescent property. DPT&#8208;AuNCs firstly assembles into non&#8208;luminescent nanofibers (kinetically controlled), which further transforms into strongly luminescent microflowers (thermodynamically controlled).







Abstract
Modulating the assembly pathway is an indispensable strategy for optimizing the performance of optical materials. However, implementing this strategy is nontrivial for metal nanocluster building blocks, due to the limited functional modification of nanoclusters and complexity of their emission mechanism. In this report, we demonstrate that a gold nanocluster modified by 4,6&#8208;diamino&#8208;2&#8208;pyrimidinethiol (DPT&#8208;AuNCs) self&#8208;assembles into two distinct aggregation structures in methanol (MeOH)/water mixed solvent, thus exhibiting pathway complexity. Kinetic studies show that DPT&#8208;AuNCs firstly assembles into non&#8208;luminescent nanofibers (kinetically controlled), which further transforms into strongly luminescent microflowers (thermodynamically controlled). In&#8208;depth analysis of the assembly mechanism reveals that the transformation of aggregation structures involves the disassembly of nanofibers and a subsequent nucleation&#8208;growth process. Temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and infrared (IR) measurements reveal that inter&#8208;cluster hydrogen bonding bridged by solvent molecules and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction are the key factors for emission enhancement. The photoluminescent property of DPT&#8208;AuNCs can be controlled by varying the cosolvent in water, enabling DPT&#8208;AuNCs to distinguish different kind of alcohols, particularly the isomerism n&#8208;propanol (NPA) and isopropanol (IPA). Additionally, the addition of seeds effectively regulate the assembly kinetics of DPT&#8208;AuNCs. This study advances our understanding of assembly pathways and improves the luminescent performance of nanoclusters (NCs).

         <title>Total Synthesis of (15R)&#8208; and (15S)&#8208;Prostaglandin A2</title>

Caribbean Vibes in the Lab: Prostaglandin A2 is a tissue hormone, which is also present in Caribbean Sea whips. The short and robust total syntheses of both naturally occurring PGA2 epimers and the subsequent biological evaluation of both compounds revealed an interaction of PGA2 depending on the stereochemistry at C15.







Abstract
From both pharmaceutical and structural perspectives, the large family of prostaglandins represent a truly remarkable class of natural products. Prostaglandin A2 is a tissue hormone naturally found in human seminal plasma and in the sea whip Plexaura homomalla with yet poorly understood biological or therapeutic effects. Herein, a novel strategy for the stereoselective construction of both naturally occurring prostaglandin A2 epimers and first insights into their functional effects on the major inhibitory neurotransmitter &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptors (GABAAR) are provided. The synthesis of both epimers was achieved in only 11 steps starting from commercially available 2,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;tetrahydrofuran employing an organocatalytic domino&#8208;aldol reaction, a Mizoroki&#8208;Heck reaction, a Wittig reaction as well as an oxidation&#8208;decarboxylation sequence. The (15R)&#8208;epimer significantly reduced GABA&#8208;induced currents through GABAA receptors while its (15S)&#8208;epimer did not show any significant effect. These data suggest that (15R)&#8208;PGA2 might serve as a novel scaffold for the development of selective GABAA receptor modulators.

         <title>Searching for &#8220;Greener&#8221; Bioequivalents of CF3 to Lower its Environmental Impact</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Considering concerns on the negative environmental effects of CF3 containing compounds, we searched for &#8220;greener&#8221; alternatives. We found &#8722;I as the best alternative since it is equivalent in all aspects studied, size, electronic and lipophilic, followed by &#8722;F, &#8208;cyclo&#8208;Pr, &#8722;2&#8208;oxetyl, &#8722;SF5 and &#8722;SCH3. We suggest using these functionalities as an alternative to &#8722;CF3 in the preparation of new therapies.







Abstract
Considering the broad use of the trifluoromethyl functional group (&#8722;CF3) in medicinal chemistry and taking into account the recent concerns on the negative environmental effects of CF3 containing compounds, we are searching for &#8220;greener&#8221; alternatives. Thus, different chemical groups (i.&#8201;e. iodide, fluoride, cyclopropyl, isopropyl, cyclobutyl, 3&#8208;oxetyl, 2&#8208;oxetyl, methylsulfide, pentafluorosulfide, methylsulfonyl and sulfonamide) have been considered as potential bioequivalents of &#8722;CF3 aiming to use them in compounds with therapeutic interest instead of the polyfluoride functionality. Different structural (molecular surface and volume) and physicochemical (electronic and lipophilic) aspects of the bioequivalent functionalities proposed have been theoretically calculated and compared to those of &#8722;CF3. Additionally, the corresponding phenyl derivatives carrying these functionalities have been purchased or prepared and their experimental lipophilicity (i.&#8201;e. LogP) measured using shake&#8208;flask experiments and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Dynamics in Segregated Donor&#8208;Acceptor Stacks Versus a Peri&#8208;Bisdonor&#8208;Acceptor System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Delocalized excitation in the segregated stacks of the naphthalenemonoimide&#8208;perylene based donor&#8208;acceptor system (NI&#8208;Pe) is reported. In the monomer of the fork&#8208;shaped bisdonor&#8208;acceptor system (NI&#8208;Pe2) with intrinsic close&#8208;stacked perylene donors, a long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated (CS) state is observed in non&#8208;polar solvents. The CS state involves a delocalized perylene dimer radical cation engendered by the peri&#8208;perylene interactions in NI&#8208;Pe2.







Abstract
The investigation of impact of through&#8208;space/through&#8208;bond electronic interaction among chromophores on photoexcited&#8208;state properties has immense potential owing to the distinct emergent photophysical pathways. Herein, the photoexcited&#8208;state dynamics of homo&#8208;sorted &#960;&#8208;stacked aggregates of a naphthalenemonoimide and perylene&#8208;based acceptor&#8208;donor (NI&#8208;Pe) system and a fork&#8208;shaped acceptor&#8208;bisdonor (NI&#8208;Pe2) system possessing integrally stacked peri&#8208;substituted donors was examined. Femtosecond transient absorption (fsTA) spectra of NI&#8208;Pe monomer recorded in chloroform displayed spectroscopic signatures of the singlet state of Pe; 1Pe*, the charge&#8208;separated state; NI&#8722;&#8901;&#8208;Pe+&#8901;, and the triplet state of Pe; 3Pe*. The examination of ultrafast excited&#8208;state processes of NI&#8208;Pe aggregate in chloroform revealed faster charge recombination (

         <title>Stereochemically Active Lone Pairs Stabilizing Intrinsic Vacancy Defects in Thermoelectric InTe</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoelectric InTe exhibits significant structural disorder in the form of In+ vacancies. Using 3D&#8208;&#916;PDF informed Monte&#8208;Carlo simulations we reveal the local structure associated with these defects. This structure allows the local expression of stereochemically active lone pairs with an associated electronic energy gain, which is proposed to be a driving force for the formation of the intrinsic vacancy defects.







Abstract
Harvesting waste heat efficiently with thermoelectric energy conversion requires materials with low thermal conductivity. Recently, it was demonstrated how dynamic lone pair expression in thermoelectric InTe is responsible for giant anharmonicity leading to a very low lattice thermal conductivity. InTe also contains correlated disorder of intrinsic defects due to vacancies, and this contributes to additional lowering of the thermal conductivity. Here we use the three&#8208;dimensional difference pair distribution function (3D&#8208;&#916;PDF) to analyze 25&#8197;K single crystal diffuse X&#8208;ray scattering from InTe to unravel the local defect structure, and propose a microscopic structural model. Extended off&#8208;centering of In+ ions induced by vacancies allows for the local expression of stereochemically active lone pairs. The associated electronic stabilization is proposed to be a driving force for the formation of In+ vacancy defects in InTe.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Corannulene Flanked N&#8208;heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) Precursors and Preparation of Their Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the mechanosynthesis of novel corannulene&#8208;flanked imidazolium bromide NHC precursors. The proposed approach is benchmarked against conventional solution&#8208;based methods using green metrics and energy consumption parameters, showcasing ball&#8208;milling as a greener and more energy&#8208;efficient technique. In addition, the new compounds are demonstrated to be robust ligands for transition metals using ligand substitution reactions as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept.







Abstract
The synthesis of new compounds is an important pillar for the advancement of the field of chemistry and adjacent fields. In this regard, over the last decades huge efforts have been made to not only develop new molecular entities but also more efficient sustainable synthetic methodologies due to the increasing concerns over environmental sustainability. In this context, we have developed synthetic routes to novel corannulene flanked imidazolium bromide NHC precursors both in the solid&#8208;state and solution phases. Our work presents a comprehensive comparative study of mechanochemical routes and conventional solution&#8208;based methods. Green metrics and energy consumption comparison were performed for both routes revealing ball&#8208;milling generation of these compounds to be an environmentally greener technique to produce such precursors compared to conventional solvent&#8208;based methods. In addition, we have demonstrated proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of the herein reported corannulene flanked NHCs to be robust ligands for transition metals and their ligand substitution reactions.

Abstract
We described a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed atom economic and selective hydroamination&#8208;cyclization of alkynyl&#8208;tethered quinazolinones to prepare a variety of indole&#8208;fused pyrazino[1,2&#8208;a]quinazolinones in good to excellent yields ranging from 39&#8201;%&#8211;99&#8201;% under mild reaction conditions. Control experiments revealed that coordination&#8208;directed method of quinazolinone moiety with copper(I) was important for the selective hydroamination&#8208;cyclization of alkynes at the N1&#8208;atom instead of N3&#8208;atom of quinazolinone. The reaction could be easily performed at gram scales and some prepared indole&#8208;fused pyrazino[1,2&#8208;a]quinazolinones with donating groups on the indole moiety showed a distinct fluorescence emission wavelength with blue shift under the acid conditions.

Wittig reaction was performed in Deep Eutectic Solvents with high yields, wide scope, facile TPPO (triphenyl phosphine oxide) removal and scalability of the process.







Abstract
Wittig reaction between substituted phosphonium salts and (hetero)aromatic and alkyl carbonyl compounds in Deep Eutectic Solvents has been developed under a scalable and friendly protocol. Highly efficient reactions were successfully run with a wide range of bases including organic (DBU, LiTMP, t&#8208;BuOK) and inorganic (NaOH, K2CO3) ones in ChCl/Gly 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 (mol/mol) as solvent under mild conditions, at room temperature and under air. The proposed protocol was applied to a wide range of substrates, including (hetero)aromatic aldehydes with substituents as halogens (I, Br, Cl), EDG (alkoxy, methyl), EWG (NO2, CF3) or reactive groups as CN, esters, and ketones. Vinylic, alkynyl and cycloalkyl, alicyclic and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes can also be used. Highly electrophilic ketones gave good yields. The diastereoselectivity of the reaction is in complete agreement with the E/Z ratio predictable under traditional conditions. We demonstrated that the protocol is scalable to 2&#8197;g (5&#8197;mmol) of phosphonium salt, furthermore the proposed workup protocol allows to remove TPPO without need of additional chromatographic purification.

         <title>Prediction of Covalent Metal&#8208;Metal Bonding in Cp&#8722;M&#8722;M&#8217;&#8208;Nacnac Complexes of Group 2 and 12 Metals (Be, Mg, Ca, Zn, Cd, Hg)</title>

Cp&#8722;M&#8722;M&#8242;&#8208;Nacnac complexes (M=Be, Mg, Ca, Zn, Cd, Hg) are predicted to exhibit electron&#8208;sharing covalent metal&#8208;metal bonds with a [MM&#8242;]2+ core. QTAIM predicts non&#8208;nuclear attractors (NNAs) with substantial electron density in the BeBe, MgMg, and CaCa complexes, suggesting that these metal&#8208;metal bonds also retain significant metallic character that can be associated with reducing reactivity. The novel metal&#8208;metal bonding makes for appealing synthetic targets.







Abstract
Bimetallic CpMM'Nacnac molecules with group 2 and 12 metals (M=Be, Mg, Ca, Zn, Cd, Hg) that contain novel metal&#8208;metal bonding have been investigated in a theoretical study of their molecular and electronic structure, thermodynamic stability, and metal&#8208;metal bonding. In all cases the metal&#8208;metal bonds are characterized as electron&#8208;sharing covalent single bonds from natural bond orbital (NBO) and energy&#8208;decomposition analysis with natural orbitals of chemical valence (EDA&#8208;NOCV) analysis. The sum of [MM&#8242;] charges is relatively constant, with all complexes exhibiting a [MM&#8242;]2+ core. Quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analysis indicates the presence of non&#8208;nuclear attractors (NNA) in the metal&#8208;metal bonds of the BeBe, MgMg, and CaCa complexes. There is substantial electron density (0.75&#8211;1.33&#8197;e) associated with the NNAs, which indicates that these metal&#8208;metal bonds, while classified as covalent electron&#8208;sharing bonds, retain significant metallic character that can be associated with reducing reactivity of the complex. The predicted stability of these complexes, combined with their novel covalent metal&#8208;metal bonding and potential as reducing agents, make them appealing targets for the synthesis of new metal&#8208;metal bonds.

         <title>Electrochemical Decarboxylative Cross&#8208;Coupling with Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct electrochemical decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling with nucleophiles has been developed for the synthesis of structurally diverse fluoride, alcohol, ether, ester, and amine products. This strategy takes advantage of the ready availability of these building blocks from commercial libraries, as well as the mild and oxidant&#8208;free conditions provided by the electrochemical system.







Abstract
Decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reactions are powerful tools for carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds formation, but typically require pre&#8208;activated carboxylic acids as substrates or heteroelectrophiles as functional groups. Herein, we present an electrochemical decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling of carboxylic acids with structurally diverse fluorine, alcohol, H2O, acid, and amine as nucleophiles. This strategy takes advantage of the ready availability of these building blocks from commercial libraries, as well as the mild and oxidant&#8208;free conditions provided by electrochemical system. This reaction demonstrates good functional&#8208;group tolerance and its utility in late&#8208;stage functionalization.

         <title>Visible Light Promoted Site&#8208;Specific Functionalization of &#945;&#8208;Acyloxy Carboxamides: Unlocking a Forbidden Chemical Space in the Passerini Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel method is presented, demonstrating the facile generation of &#945;&#8208;acyloxy carboxamide radicals via photoredox catalysis of Passerini adducts, obtained employing a 4&#8208;formyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyridine. These radicals efficiently undergo Giese reactions with various olefins, yielding novel Passerini compounds unattainable through traditional aldehyde&#8208;based routes.







Abstract
The facile generation of the &#945;&#8208;acyloxy carboxamide radical is hereby reported for the first time, utilizing a photoredox catalyzed reaction of Passerini adducts synthesized using a 4&#8208;formyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyridine as the carbonyl component. This radical effectively engages in a Giese reaction with a range of olefins, ultimately leading to the synthesis of novel Passerini&#8208;derived products not previously amenable to direct aldehyde&#8208;based transformations. Consequently, the resulting strategy, developed both in batch and in flow, offers a promising opportunity to expand the chemical space accessible through the Passerini reaction, virtually incorporating &#8220;impossible&#8221; aldehydes.

         <title>Front Cover: Covalently Linked 5,6,11,12&#8208;Tetraazanaphthacene Dimer and Its Triptycene&#8208;Capped Derivatives as Electron Acceptors (Chem. Eur. J. 50/2024)</title>

         <dc:description>
5,6,11,12&#8208;Tetraazanaphthacene (TANC), from the family of azaacenes, is a conveniently synthesised electron acceptor. To further increase the electron affinity of TANC, an extended dimer bi&#8208;TANC with a single covalent bond was developed. Regrettably, the larger bi&#8208;TANC had only severely poor solubility. This has been dramatically improved in bi&#8208;TpTANC, in which both ends of bi&#8208;TANC are end&#8208;capped with triptycene (Tp). The electrochemistry of bi&#8208;TpTANC in solution confirms its higher electron affinity with a LUMO level of &#8722;4.1&#8197;eV, making it a potentially practical n&#8208;type material. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Kamebuchi, M. Tadokoro and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400632).

Marine natural product on target: GPCRs are prime targets for drug discovery, representing targets of over 40&#8201;% of approved drugs. The cover illustrates tumonolide, a new marine natural product, docked into the binding pocket of the tachykinin receptor&#8197;2 (TACR2). The TACR2&#8208;selective GPCR inhibitor was isolated from a marine cyanobacterium, and its structure, including the absolute configuration depicted on the ocean floor, was elucidated through various spectroscopic and computational methods. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Luesch and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401393).

An aquarium contains the materials for synthesizing the marine natural products (15S)&#8208; and (15R)&#8208;prostaglandin&#8197;A2. Both epimers can be isolated from the sea whip Plexaura homomalla. While the (15S)&#8208;prostaglandin&#8197;A2 (left) significantly reduced GABA&#8208;induced currents through GABAA receptors, its 15R epimer (right) did not show any significant effect. The bubbler on the left side is shaped like Spittelau, a Viennese landmark located near the lab. More information can be found in the Research Article by N. Sch&#252;tzenmeister and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401921).

Transforming the impossible into the possible: A chemical astronaut exploits blue light irradiation to activate Passerini products containing a Hantzsch ester. This modern method facilitates the generation of &#945;&#8208;acyloxyamide radicals, which can be trapped by suitable Michael acceptors, enabling the exploration of a novel chemical space. The new Passerini products obtained formally derive from &#8220;impossible aldehydes&#8221;. More information can be found in the Research Article by G. Papeo, G.&#8197;C.

         <title>Reproducible Green Syntheses Using Hybrid Sol&#8208;Gel Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aiming to contribute to eradicate a certain naivet&#233; common to many research chemists specializing in green chemistry and catalysis, this study illustrates through selected examples of reproducible green syntheses using hybrid sol&#8208;gel catalysts from doctoral theses and research articles published between 2013 and early 2024, how said catalysts have been applied to a number industrially relevant green synthetic methods.







Abstract
Referring to selected examples of reproducible green syntheses using hybrid sol&#8208;gel catalysts of the SiliaCat series from different doctoral theses and research works published between 2015 and early 2024, this study briefly illustrates how said catalysts have been applied in a number of green synthetic methods of significant industrial relevance. This shows evidence that the nanochemistry &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; sol&#8208;gel approach based on catalytic species entrapped in organically modified silicas as effective and versatile heterogeneous catalysts developed between the late 1990s and 2010 has succeeded. Subsequent developments will show how the use of said materials in automated syntheses, supplying data to machine learning algorithms actually leads to faster and cheaper optimization of the reaction conditions. Said progress ultimately will further accelerate industrial uptake of heterogeneous catalysis under flow in the fine chemical industry whose reluctance to change processes was due to the need to replace financially amortized (and expensive) production plants.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleic acids, with their unique duplex structure, which is key for information replication, have sparked interest in self&#8208;replication's role in life's origins. Early template&#8208;based replicators, initially built on short oligonucleotides, expanded to include peptides and synthetic molecules. We explore here the potential of a class of synthetic duplex&#8208;forming oligoanilines, as self&#8208;replicators. We have recently developed oligoanilines equipped with 2&#8208;trifluoromethylphenol&#8211;phosphine oxide H&#8208;bond base pairs and we investigate whether the imine formed between aniline and aldehyde complementary monomers can self&#8208;replicate. Despite lacking a clear sigmoidal kinetic profile, control experiments with a methylated donor and a competitive inhibitor support self&#8208;replication. Further investigations with the reduced aniline dimer demonstrate templated synthesis, revealing a characteristic parabolic growth. After showing sequence selective duplex formation, templated synthesis and the emergence of catalytic function, the self&#8208;replication behaviour further suggests that the unique properties of nucleic acids can be paralleled by synthetic recognition&#8208;encoded molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Chirality at Metal in a Linear [Ag(NHC)2]+ Complex: Stereogenic C&#8211;Ag&#8211;C Axis, Atropisomerism and Role of &#960;&#8208;&#960; Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality at the metal center is a well&#8208;established concept, exemplified by numerous four&#8208; and six&#8208;coordinated complexes. Here, a pioneering example of linear chirality&#8208;at&#8208;metal is described: L&#8208;2&#8208;[Ag(NHC)2]+ (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene). In solution, stabilizing &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions preserve the chiral information of the solid state. Consequently, a novel class of atropisomers is identified, whose stereogenicity arises from hindered rotation about a C&#8211;Ag&#8211;C axis, instead of a typical C&#8211;C bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;attached (NHC)Gold(I) and (NHC)Copper(I) Complexes as Photoswitchable Catalysts</title>

         <dc:description>Photoswitchable (pre)catalysts, N,N'&#8208;bis&#8208;azobenzene&#8208;based (NHC)gold(I) and N,N'&#8208;bis&#8208;azobenzene&#8208;derived (NHC)copper(I) complexes are reported. Trans to cis isomerization of the attached photoswitchable moieties in the Au(I) complex enables four&#8208;fold decrement in the rate of oxazoline formation reaction. Whereas the progress of the copper(I) catalyzed, azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition reaction gets reduced by at least threefold. Alternate exposure to UV and blue light could easily toggle the rate of reactions remotely. The catalytic activity of thermodynamically stable trans&#8208;trans isomers is found to be similar to the common N&#8208;aryl substituted NHC&#8208;Au/Cu(I) complexes. NHC&#8208;Au(I) and &#8208;Cu(I) compounds bearing (trans)azobenzene moieties were characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Photoswitching, recyclability studies, and the metastable isomer's thermal half&#8208;life in both complexes were studied via UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy. Whereas the extent of photoswitching and concomitant formation of geometrical isomers were investigated by using&#160;1H&#8208;NMR&#160;spectroscopic study. Calculated percentage buried volumes of the three geometrical isomers show the trend trans&#8208;trans &lt; trans&#8208;cis &lt; cis&#8208;cis.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalized &#945;&#8208;Cyanostilbene Derivatives for Detection of Hypoxia or Proteostasis Imbalance in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Cyanostilbene represents one of the easily functionalized aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) scaffolds. It has been widely adopted for the construction of fluorescent materials for broad applications. Here, we further expanded the utilization of &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbene derivatives for the detection of hypoxia or proteostasis imbalance in live cells. Four different amine containing donors were introduced to construct &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbene derivatives (R&#8208;ASC) with donor&#8208;acceptor scaffolds. Equipped with the cysteine (Cys) reactive group, maleimide (MI), R&#8208;ASC&#8208;MI shows fluorescence turn&#8208;on property upon binding with unfolded proteins in vitro and in live cells under proteostatic stress. By virtue of R&#8208;ASC&#8208;MI, the level of unfolded protein loads in cells can be quantified by flow cytometry, or visualized under microscope. Furthermore, we also characterized the performance of R&#8208;ASC&#8208;NO2, synthetic precursors of R&#8208;ASC&#8208;MI, in cellular hypoxia. R&#8208;ASC&#8208;NO2 revealed upregulated activities of nitroreductase, as well as increased hydrophobicity in live cells, under either chemical (NaN3) induced or atmospheric (1% O2) hypoxia. Together, the advantages of easy modification and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of new &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbene derivatives reported in this work highlight the great potential of &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbene in constructing functional biosensors and many other domains.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationships in Supramolecular Hosts Targeting Bacterial Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) Lipids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The World Health Organization has described the antimicrobial resistance crisis as one of the top ten global public health threats. New antimicrobial agents that can fight infections caused by antimicrobial resistant pathogens are therefore needed. A potential strategy is the development of small molecules that can selectively interact with bacterial membranes (or membranes of other microbial pathogens), and thereby rapidly kill the bacteria. Here, we report the structure&#8208;activity relationship within a group of 22 compounds that were designed to bind the bacterial lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Liposome&#8208;based studies reveal that the lipophilicity of the compounds has the strongest effect on both the affinity and selectivity for PE. The best results were obtained for compounds with logP &#8776; 3.75, which showed a 5x to 7x selectivity for bacterial PE lipids over human PC (phosphatidylcholine) lipids. Furthermore, these compounds also showed potent antibacterial activity against the Gram&#8208;positive bacterium B. cereus, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) below 10 &#181;M, a concentration where they showed minimal hemolytic activity against human red blood cells. These results not only show the possibility of PE&#8208;binding small molecules to function as antibiotics, but also provide guidelines for the development of compounds targeting other types of biologically relevant membrane lipids.</dc:description>

         <title>Counterion Exchange Enhances the Brightness and Photostability of a Fluorous Cyanine Dye</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorofluorophores are a unique class of fluorophores that can be solubilized in perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and used to study biological systems. However, because of the low dielectric constant and high oxygen solubility in the fluorous phase, the brightness and photostability of the fluorofluorophores are significantly diminished. Here, we leveraged the tight ion pairing in the fluorous phase to improve the photophysical properties of a fluorous soluble pentamethine dye (FCy5) via counterion exchange. We found that larger, softer, fluorinated, aryl borate counterions promote the ideal polymethine state where charge delocalization across the polymethine chain increases the brightness (6&#8208;fold) and photostability (55&#8208;fold) of FCy5.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Methods for the Formation of Free Carbyne Radicals in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbyne free radicals RC&#8942; (RC) are usually associated with high&#8208;energy processes, thus research on their preparation, chemical reactivity, and prevalence under mild conditions is scarce. Recently, it was reported that metallo&#8208;complexes containing CR ligands may undergo spontaneous degradation in aqueous solutions to produce free RC radicals. These highly reactive species may react with each other to form the corresponding alkyne and other products. The reaction of 1,1,1 halo&#8208;carbo&#8208;hydrates with Cr(II) ions also forms RC radicals under mild conditions. Herein, we report two additional synthetic routes that produce free RC radicals under mild conditions. First, the reaction between metallic zinc and acetic anhydride produces 2&#8208;butyne and several other C2, C3, and C4 compounds. Isotopic&#8208;labeling experiments indicate that the formation of 2&#8208;butyne results from an inter&#8208;molecular reaction in which two RC moieties from two acetic anhydride molecules combine in solution. In addition, the degradation of the tri&#8208;molybdenum complex [Mo3(H3CC&#8801;CCH3)(OAc)(H2O)2Br7], in which a 2&#8208;butyne ligand is coordinated to the Mo3 framework in a &#956;3&#8208;&#951;2 (&#8869;) binding mode in aqueous solution produces several C2, C3, C4 and C5 molecules. This indicates the formation of free CH3C radicals by a homolytic cleavage of the carbon&#8208;carbon triple bond.</dc:description>

First, the reaction between metallic zinc and acetic anhydride produces 2-butyne and several other C2, C3, and C4 compounds. Isotopic-labeling experiments indicate that the formation of 2-butyne results from an inter-molecular reaction in which two RC moieties from two acetic anhydride molecules combine in solution. In addition, the degradation of the tri-molybdenum complex [Mo3(H3CC&#8801;CCH3)(OAc)(H2O)2Br7], in which a 2-butyne ligand is coordinated to the Mo3 framework in a &#956;3-&#951;2 (&#8869;) binding mode in aqueous solution produces several C2, C3, C4 and C5 molecules. This indicates the formation of free CH3C radicals by a homolytic cleavage of the carbon-carbon triple bond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bis&#8208;Squaramide&#8208;Based [2]Rotaxane Hosts for Anion Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first examples of bis&#8208;squaramide axle containing [2]rotaxanes linked via rigid aryl and flexible alkyl spacers synthesised using copper(I) catalysed active metal template methodology are reported. The halide and oxoanion binding properties of the [2]rotaxanes in aqueous&#8208;organic solvent media are examined through extensive 1H&#8208;NMR titration experiments to investigate the impact of integrating multiple squaramide motifs on the anion binding capabilities of the interlocked receptors. These studies reveal that the bis&#8208;squaramide rotaxane host systems exhibit enhanced halide anion binding capabilities relative to a mono&#8208;squaramide axle functionalised rotaxane, demonstrating a rare anti&#8208;Hofmeister bias halide anion selectivity trend in aqueous&#8208;organic mixtures and highlighting the efficacy of the potent solvent shielded hydrophobic interlocked binding pocket created upon mechanical bond formation. Notably, employing a rigid aryl linker between the two squaramide motifs in the axle component enables the rotaxane host to exhibit strong and selective binding of tetrahedral oxoanions. Conversely, a flexible alkyl spacer facilitates trigonal oxoanion selective recognition by the bis&#8208;squaramide [2]rotaxane.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Vacancy Enriched Porous BN Fibers for Enhanced Polysulfides Adsorption and Conversion in High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presented herein centers on the fabrication of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) BN fibers with abundant pores and sufficient N&#8208;vacancy defects, achieved through a unique strategy of thermal crystallization following a pre&#8208;condensation step. After incorporating these fibers with highly interweaved bacterial cellulose (BC) followed by carbonization, the resulting Nv&#8208;BN@CBC exhibited higher specific capacity, superior rate capability, and more stable cycling performance.







Abstract
Severe shuttle effect of soluble polysulfides and sluggish redox kinetics have been thought of as the critical issues hindering the extensive applications of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Herein, one&#8208;dimensional boron nitride (1D BN) fibers with abundant pores and sufficient N&#8208;vacancy defects were synthesized using a thermal crystallization following a pre&#8208;condensation step. The 1D structure of BN facilitates unblocked ions diffusion pathways during charge/discharge cycles. The embedded pores within the polar BN strengthen the immobilization of polysulfides via both physical confinement and chemical interaction. Moreover, the highly exposed active surface area and intentionally created N&#8208;vacancy sites substantially promote reaction kinetics by lowering the energy barriers of the rate&#8208;limiting steps. After incorporating with conductive carbon networks and elemental S, the as&#8208;prepared S/Nv&#8208;BN@CBC cathode of LSBs deliver an initial discharge capacity of up to 1347&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, while maintaining a low decay rate of 0.03&#8201;% per cycle over 1000&#8197;cycles at 1600&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. This work offers an effective strategy to mitigate the shuttle effect and highlights the significant potential of defect&#8208;engineered BN in accelerating the reaction kinetics of LSBs.

         <title>A Peptide Strategy for Inhibiting Different Protein Aggregation Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
General peptide inhibitors of protein aggregation were developed by discovering the molecular determinants of inherent anti&#8208;aggregation activity. Substitutions maximizing &#960;&#8208;stacking, H&#8208;bonding and flexibility further enhanced the potency of natural inhibitors. So&#8208;designed peptides potently inhibited unrelated proteins aggregating via different mechanisms ranging from amorphous aggregation to Tau and Huntingtin amyloid aggregation.







Abstract
Protein aggregation correlates with many human diseases. Protein aggregates differ in structure and shape. Strategies to develop effective aggregation inhibitors that reach the clinic failed so far. Here, we developed a family of peptides targeting early aggregation stages for both amorphous and fibrillar aggregates of proteins unrelated in sequence and structure. They act on dynamic precursors before mechanistic differentiation takes place. Using peptide arrays, we first identified peptides inhibiting the amorphous aggregation of a molten globular, aggregation&#8208;prone mutant of the Axin tumor suppressor. Optimization revealed that the peptides activity did not depend on their sequences but rather on their molecular determinants: a composition of 20&#8211;30&#8201;% flexible, 30&#8211;40&#8201;% aliphatic and 20&#8211;30&#8201;% aromatic residues, a hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity ratio close to 1, and an even distribution of residues of different nature throughout the sequence. The peptides also suppressed fibrillation of Tau, a disordered protein that forms amyloids in Alzheimer's disease, and slowed down that of Huntingtin Exon1, an amyloidogenic protein in Huntington's disease, both entirely unrelated to Axin. Our compounds thus target early stages of different aggregation mechanisms, inhibiting both amorphous and amyloid aggregation. Such cross&#8208;mechanistic, multi&#8208;targeting aggregation inhibitors may be lead compounds for developing drug candidates against various protein aggregation diseases.

         <title>Water&#8208;Stable, Eight&#8208;electron Acceptor Drives Anion&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Water Assisted Tunable Ionic Self&#8208;Assembly and Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly electron&#8208;deficient, water&#8208;stable, eight&#8208;electron acceptor scaffold has been used as a platform to realize proton conduction through ionic self&#8208;assembly. In this unique self&#8208;assembled material, 1D water tapes are revealed, that undergo hydrogen&#8208;bonding with halide anions, thereby generating a pathway for anion&#8208;assisted, tunable proton conduction.







Abstract
Organic &#960;&#8208;scaffolds are being envisaged for new&#8208;age electron&#8208; and ion&#8208;responsive materials that can accumulate electrons as well as transport proton. However, such systems are extremely rare as electron&#8208;deficient scaffolds are unstable in aqueous solution. Here we detail the synthesis of a water&#8208;stable core&#8208;naphthalenediimide&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;viologen based tetra&#8208;cation, which accumulates up to eight&#8208;electrons within an exceptionally narrow potential window of +0.05&#8197;V and &#8722;1.12&#8197;V. The supramolecular interactions and the ensuing ionic framework are tunable based on the three anions, e.&#8201;g., Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722; and PF6&#8722;, that are investigated in this work. The ionic framework is formed and supported by a range of H&#8208;bonds, in which, the nitro benzyl groups act as pillars connecting the 1D water&#8208;tapes and the halide anions. The water molecules are hydrogen&#8208;bonded with the halide anions and bestow a facile pathway for the proton conduction, with proton conductivity up to 3.19&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. In contrast, the ionic assembly formed by the lipophilic PF6&#8722; anions do not host the water tapes and consequently the proton conductivity is found to be four orders of magnitude lower. This is a unique example, whereby proton conductivity is realized and is tunable within a highly electron&#8208;deficient, eight&#8208;electron acceptor, water&#8208;stable ionic supramolecular system.

The water molecules are hydrogen-bonded with the halide anions and bestow a facile pathway for the proton conduction, with proton conductivity up to 3.19&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. In contrast, the ionic assembly formed by the lipophilic PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions do not host the water tapes and consequently the proton conductivity is found to be four orders of magnitude lower. This is a unique example, whereby proton conductivity is realized and is tunable within a highly electron-deficient, eight-electron acceptor, water-stable ionic supramolecular system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Azines Bearing a Guanidine Core from N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC)&#8208;Derived Selenoureas and Diazo Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study introduces a novel transformation between N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;derived selenoureas and diazo compounds in the presence of triphenylphosphine. Products incorporating both an azine and a guanidine moiety are obtained, with potential applications in pharmaceuticals, materials chemistry, and organic synthesis.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;derived selenoureas comprise a fundamentally important class of NHC derivatives, with key applications in coordination chemistry and the determination of NHC electronic properties. Considering the broad reactivity of chalcogen&#8208;containing compounds, it is surprising to note that the use of NHC&#8208;derived selenoureas as organic synthons remains essentially unexplored. The present contribution introduces a novel, straightforward transformation leading to azines bearing a guanidine moiety, through the reaction of a wide range of NHC&#8208;derived selenoureas with commercially available diazo compounds, in the presence of triphenylphosphine. This transformation offers a new approach to such products, having biological, materials chemistry, and organic synthesis applications. The guanidine&#8208;bearing azines are obtained in excellent yields, with all manipulations taking place in air. A reaction mechanism is proposed, based on both experimental mechanistic findings and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. A one&#8208;pot, multicomponent transesterification reaction between selenoureas, &#945;&#8208;diazoesters, alcohols, and triphenylphosphine was also developed, providing highly functionalized azines.

         <title>Self&#8208;Replication Without Hydrogen&#8208;Bonds: An Exobiotic Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exobiotic self&#8208;replication: When sulfur is positioned between the two nitrogens of benzothiadiazole, it can engage in edge&#8208;on molecular recognition events. We present a new potential self&#8208;replicating system based on this interaction, and evidence for autocatalysis. The designs have implications for exobiology, due to their cosmic similarities and potential for genetic capacity.







Abstract
Life on Earth uses DNA as the central template for self&#8208;replication, genetic encoding, and information transfer. However, there are no physical laws precluding life's existence elsewhere in space, and alternative life forms may not need DNA. In the search for exobiology, knowing what to look for as a biosignature remains a challenge &#8211; especially if it is not from the obvious list of biologic building blocks. Clues from chemicals recently discovered on Mars and in the Taurus Molecular Cloud 1 (TMC&#8208;1), show that intriguing organic compounds exist beyond Earth, which could provide a starting point for unconventional exobiotic designs. Here we present a new potential self&#8208;replicating system with structural similarities to recently discovered compounds on Mars and TMC&#8208;1. Rather than using DNA's hydrogen&#8208;bonding motif for reliable base&#8208;paring, our design employs sulfur&#8208;nitrogen interactions to selectively template unique benzothiadiazole units in sequence. We synthesized and studied two versions of this system, one reversible and the other irreversible, and found experimental evidence of self&#8208;replication in d&#8208;chloroform solvent. These results are part of a larger pursuit in our lab for developing a basis for a potential exobiological system using starting blocks closely related to these cosmic compounds.

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization and Interconversion of p&#8211;Tolylsulfone&#8208;Functionalized Norbornadiene/Quadricyclane Couples</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of new push&#8211;pull functionalized norbornadiene/quadricyclane (NBD/QC) couples was generated and investigated. For the first time the para&#8208;tolylsulfone moiety was chosen as electron&#8208;withdrawing group. The library was comprehensively examined regarding their interconversion capability and photophysical properties.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of library of new 2,3&#8211;disubstituted norbornadiene/quadricyclane couples. For the first time, the para&#8211;tolylsulfone moiety was employed as electron&#8211;withdrawing substituent in combination with a variety of different electron donors as counterparts. Comprehensive characterization was conducted for every interconversion couple. By comparison with structurally related molecules published before we established the tosyl moiety as suitable alternative to previously investigated ester functionalities by providing similar photophysical properties. The photo&#8211;induced interconversion behavior was investigated via UV/Vis&#8208; and NMR&#8211;spectroscopy. The UV/Vis experiments were carried out exclusively in acetonitrile, whereas several solvents were investigated in the NMR studies. A detailed description and comparison of the isomerization behavior is provided, while examining relevant optical properties like &#955;max and &#955;onset. Thereby, an enhanced red&#8208;shift up to &#955;max=394&#8197;nm combined with an &#955;onset value of 469&#8197;nm could be generated which is necessary for potential applications.

         <title>Redox Transformations of the OX063 Radical in Biological Media: Oxidative Decay of Initial Trityl with Further Formation of Structurally&#8208;Modified TAM</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We studied in details redox reactions of OX063 radical in biological media. These reactions can introduce distortions into EPR oximetry data derived for objects under hypoxia, and they may possibly pose obstacles to the successful application of TAMs to spin&#8208;labeling of biopolymers for experiments in&#8197;vivo or in the cell. The use of 13C labeling to track these reactions is described.







Abstract
Being a low&#8208;toxic and hydrophilic representative of TAM, OX063 has shown its suitability for in&#8208;vivo and in&#8208;cell EPR experiments and design of spin labels. Using 13C labeling, we investigated the course of oxidative degradation of OX063 into quinone&#8208;methide (QM) under the influence of superoxide as well as further thiol&#8208;promoted reduction of QM into TAM radical, which formally corresponds to substitution of a carboxyl function by a hydroxyl group. We found these transformations being quantitative in model reactions mimicking specific features of biological media and confirmed the presence of these reactions in the blood and liver homogenate of mice in&#8197;vitro. The emergence of the trityl with the hydroxyl group can be masked by an initial TAM in EPR spectra and may introduce distortions into EPR&#8208;derived oximetry data if they have been obtained for objects under hypoxia. 13C labeling allows one to detect its presence, considering its different hyperfine splitting constant on 13C1 (2.04&#8197;mT) as compared to OX063 (2.30&#8197;mT). The potential involvement of these reactions should be considered when using TAM in spin&#8208;labeling of biopolymers intended for subsequent EPR experiments, as well as in the successful application of TAM in experiments in&#8197;vivo and in cell.

         <title>Quantitative Characterization of RCA&#8208;Based DNA Hydrogels &#8211; Towards Rational Materials Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of template sequences and reaction conditions on the synthesis of DNA hydrogels via Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA) was systematically investigated. The employed methodology is high&#8208;throughput capable and facilitates the development of sequence&#8208;property relationships by correlating reaction process parameters with synthesis efficiency and mechanical material properties.







Abstract
DNA hydrogels hold significant promise for biomedical applications and can be synthesized through enzymatic Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA). Due to the exploratory nature of this emerging field, standardized RCA protocols specifying the impact of reaction parameters are currently lacking.

&lt;p&gt;The impact of template sequences and reaction conditions on the synthesis of DNA hydrogels via Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA) was systematically investigated. The employed methodology is high-throughput capable and facilitates the development of sequence-property relationships by correlating reaction process parameters with synthesis efficiency and mechanical material properties.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA hydrogels hold significant promise for biomedical applications and can be synthesized through enzymatic Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA). Due to the exploratory nature of this emerging field, standardized RCA protocols specifying the impact of reaction parameters are currently lacking. This study varied template sequences and reagent concentrations, evaluating RCA synthesis efficiency and hydrogel mechanical properties through quantitative PCR (qPCR) and indentation measurements, respectively. Primer concentration and stabilizing additives showed minimal impact on RCA efficiency, while changes in polymerase and nucleotide concentrations had a stronger effect. Concentration of the circular template exerted the greatest influence on RCA productivity. An exponential correlation between hydrogel viscosity and DNA amplicon concentration was observed, with nucleobase sequence significantly affecting both amplification efficiency and material properties, particularly through secondary structures. This study suggests that combining high-throughput experimental methods with structural folding prediction offers a viable approach for systematically establishing structure-property relationships, aiding the rational design of DNA hydrogel material systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Adsorption of Prochiral Solvent Molecules by Surface&#8208;Confined Chiral Supramolecular Assemblies: How Solvent Impacts on&#8208;Surface Chirality</title>

Adsorption of a prochiral solvent molecule in porous SAMNs formed by a chiral dehydrobenzo[12]annulene derivative leads to the reversal of supramolecular chirality of the SAMN through the prochirality recognition of a solvent molecule.







Abstract
The understanding of supramolecular chirality in self&#8208;assembled molecular networks (SAMNs) on surfaces generates a lot of interest because of its relation to the production of chiral sensors, reactors, and catalysts. We herein report the adsorption of a prochiral solvent molecule in porous SAMNs formed by a chiral dehydrobenzo[12]annulene (cDBA) derivative. Through the prochirality recognition of a solvent molecule, the supramolecular chirality of the SAMN is switched: the cDBA exclusively forms a counter&#8208;clockwise pore through co&#8208;adsorption of the solvent molecule in prochiral 1,2,4&#8208;trichlorobenzene, while in 1&#8208;phenyloctane it produces the opposite chiral, clockwise pore. The prochirality recognition of the solvent molecule in the chiral SAMN pores is attributed to the adaptable conformational changes of the chiral chains of the cDBA molecule.

         <title>Oxidative N&#8722;N Bond Formation Versus the Curtius Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present herein some experimental results, including NMR and x&#8208;ray, which have led to the recent retraction of a Nature Communications article claiming to feature a metal&#8208;free cross&#8208;dehydrogenative N&#8722;N coupling of primary amides with amines under the action of a hypervalent iodine oxidant. These findings should help the chemical research community to avoid such pitfalls in the future.







Abstract
The oxidative formation of N&#8722;N bonds from primary amides has been recently reported and then retracted in the journal Nature Communications by Kathiravan, Nicholls, and co&#8208;authors, utilizing a hypervalent iodane reagent. Unfortunately, the authors failed to recognize the Curtius reaction taking place under the described reaction conditions. Thus, the claimed N&#8722;N coupling products were not formed. Instead, the Curtius rearrangement urea coupling products were obtained. We demonstrate this herein by means of NMR and x&#8208;ray analysis, as well as with the support of an alternative synthetic route.

         <title>Tweezer Dyads for H&#8208;Bond Assisted Cooperativity in Tandem Uncaging Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tweezer dyads synthesized by click chemistry harness large two&#8208;photon absorption in the NIR region from quadrupolar antenna and enhancement of the uncaging efficiency via electron transfer sensitization leading to very high two&#8208;photon sensitivity.







Abstract
&#8220;Tandem&#8221; uncaging systems, in which a photolabile protecting group (PPG) is sensitized by an energy&#8208;harvesting antenna, may increase the photosensitivity of PPGs by several orders of magnitude for two&#8208;photon (2P) photorelease. Yet, they remain poorly accessible because of arduous multi&#8208;step synthesis. In this work, we design efficient tandem uncaging systems by (i) using a convenient assembly of the building blocks relying on click chemistry, (ii) introducing H&#8208;bonding induced proximity thus facilitating (iii) photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) as a cooperative mechanism. A strong two&#8208;photon absorber electron&#8208;donating quadrupolar antenna and various electron&#8208;accepting PPGs (mDEAC, MNI or MDNI) were clicked stepwise onto a &#8220;tweezer&#8208;shaped&#8221; pyrido&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxylate platform whose H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;stacking abilities were exploited to keep the antenna and the PPGs in close proximity. The different electron&#8208;accepting ability of the PPGs led to dyads with wildly different behaviors. Whilst the MDNI and MNI dyads showed poor dark stability or no photo&#8208;uncaging ability due to their too high electron&#8208;accepting character, the mDEAC dyad benefited from optimum redox potentials to promote PeT and slow down charge recombination, resulting in enhanced uncaging quantum yield (&#934;u=0.38) compared to mDEAC (&#934;u=0.014). This unique combination resulted in large 2P photo&#8208;sensitivity in the near&#8208;infrared window (240&#8197;GM at 710&#8197;nm).

         <title>Decarboxylative Alkylation of Carboxylic Acids with Easily Oxidizable Functional Groups Catalyzed by an Imidazole&#8208;Coordinated Fe3 Cluster under Visible Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Decarboxylative alkylation of carboxylic acids with easily oxidizable functional groups such as phenol and indole functionalities was achieved using a catalytic amount of basic iron(III) acetate, Fe(OAc)2(OH), in the presence of benzimidazole under 427 nm LED irradiation. Kinetic analyses of this catalytic reaction revealed that the reaction rate is first&#8208;order in alkenes and is linearly correlated with the light intensity; the faster reaction rate for the benzimidazole&#8208;ligated species was consistent with the increased absorbance in the visible light region. Wide functional group tolerance for the easily oxidizable groups is ascribed to the weak oxidation ability of the in situ&#8208;generated oxo&#8208;bridged iron clusters compared with other iron(III) species.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Gene Editing Technology for Tumor Microenvironment Modulation: An Emerging Anticancer Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer is a multifaceted disease influenced by both intrinsic cellular traits and extrinsic factors, with the tumor microenvironment (TME) being crucial in its progression. To satisfy their high proliferation and aggressiveness, cancer cell always plunders large amounts of nutrition and releases various signals to the surrounding, forming a dynamic TME with special metabolic, immune, microbial and physical characteristics. Due to the neglect of interactions between tumor cell and TME, traditional cancer therapies often struggle with challenges such as drug resistance, low efficacy, and recurrence. Importantly, with the development of gene editing technologies, particularly the CRISPR&#8208;Cas system, offers promising new strategies for cancer treatment. Combined with nanomaterials strategies, CRISPR&#8208;Cas technology exhibits precision, affordability, and user&#8208;friendliness with reduced side effects, which holds great promise for profoundly altering the TME at a genetic level, potentially leading to lasting anticancer outcomes. This review will delve into how CRISPR&#8208;Cas can be leveraged to manipulate the TME, examining its potential as a transformative anticancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation to Transportation: En&#8208;Route Fission&#8208;Facilitated Formation of Spheres in a Phosphorus&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymer for Transportation of Iodine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite its potential as a clean power source to meet rising electricity demands, nuclear energy generates radioactive waste, including isotopes of iodine, that pose significant environmental and health risks. There is a growing demand to capture radioactive iodine and repurpose it effectively. However, achieving this dual functionality with a single material remains a significant challenge. This study explores phosphorus&#8208;based porous organic polymers (P&#8208;POPs) as probes for these dual functionalities. By employing 4&#8208;formyl(triphenyl)phosphine (BB1) and phenyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diacetonitrile (BB2) under the Knoevenagel polycondensation method, P&#8208;POPs (PKPOPs) have been synthesized that exhibit a smooth spherical morphology, which efficiently captures and release iodine under ambient conditions, facilitating efficient transportation of molecular iodine. This novel approach aims to potentially transform nuclear waste into valuable organic feedstock via an iodination reaction. The innovative application of PKPOP has also been demonstrated for iodination reactions using ball mills and under continuous flow conditions, showcasing its potential for safer waste management and utilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigating the Mechanism of Triboluminescence: Insights from Structural and Electrostatic Characterization of Copper Thiocyanate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The creation of oppositely charged pairs, followed by their recombination to exhibit triboluminescence upon disrupting intermolecular interactions during mechanical fracture of crystal, was characterized by X&#8208;ray analysis and theoretical calculations. This study elucidated the crucial role of charge separation in triboluminescence and enabled its activation and deactivation through molecular network design.







Abstract
Triboluminescence is a phenomenon in which light is generated through mechanical stress; it has emerging applications in stress&#8208;sensing devices. Although the prevailing mechanistic model indicates that light emits from charge separation and recombination in fracture planes arising from polar structures, its application in designing triboluminescent materials remains limited owing to numerous exceptions. This study provides insights into the essential requirements for triboluminescence by investigating the structural and electrostatic properties of fractured crystals of copper thiocyanate complexes. The examined fracture plane indicated that charge pairs (which are essential for light emission) form when intermolecular interactions are disrupted during fracturing. On the basis of the nature of these charges, we successfully suppressed triboluminescence by inhibiting the formation of intermolecular interactions disrupted in the examined complexes. Furthermore, we induced its re&#8208;emergence by creating an alternative fracture plane through controlled manipulation of the molecular network. This demonstrative deactivation and reactivation of triboluminescence underscores the critical role of intermolecular disruption in generating charge pairs, a prerequisite for triboluminescence.

         <title>Origins of Temperature&#8208;Dependent Anomeric Selectivity in Glycosylations with an L&#8211;Idose Thioglycoside</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational modelling reveals the key mechanistic details explaining why glycosylations involving L&#8208;idose thioglycoside donors, and potentially also a wide range of other donors, become increasingly &#945;&#8208;selective as the temperature is raised.







Abstract
L&#8211;Idose thioglycosides are useful glycosyl donors for the construction of glycosaminoglycan oligosaccharides. When activated with NIS and catalytic TMSOTf in the presence of methanol, the stereoselectivity of O&#8208;glycosylation displays an intriguing dependence on the reaction temperature, with an increased preference for formation of the &#945;&#8208;glycoside at higher temperatures. Using a combination of vt&#8208;NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations, we show how a simple mechanistic model, based on competing reactions of the iodinated thioglycoside, can explain the main features of the temperature dependence. In this model, the increased selectivity at high temperature is attributed to differences among the entropy and energy terms of the competing reaction pathways. Neighbouring&#8208;group participation (giving an intermediate acyloxonium ion) plays an increasingly dominant role as temperature is raised. The general features of this kinetic regime may also apply more broadly to other glycosylations that likewise favour &#945;&#8208;glycoside formation at high temperature.

         <title>A Donor&#8208;Acceptor Molecular Octopus and the CLICK Procedure in Columnar Liquid Crystal Phases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular Octopus: A donor&#8208;acceptor discotic star mesogen based on a porphyrin core, bithiophene arms and decorated with four fullerenes attached via spacer forms porphyrin J&#8208;type aggregates by porphyrin&#8208;fullerene supramolecular interactions. Mixed with a complementary star providing intrinsic free space between the conjugated scaffold, the fullerenes fall into the void and assemble in completely different columnar aggregates.







Abstract
Two star&#8208;shaped mesogens with a (meso&#8208;tetraphenylporphinato) zinc (II) core and bithiophene conjugated arms with 3,4,5&#8208;trisdodecyloxyphenyl periphery were synthesized. One of these molecules was decorated with four fullerenes via an aliphatic spacer. This is the sterically overcrowded compound with an octapodal morphology. The other star lacks the fullerenes and provides free space between the conjugated arms. This mesogen does not aggregate in solution, but in solid state it forms a hexagonal columnar and a highly ordered oblique helical columnar phase, while the octopus molecule assembles in an amorphous solid. Photophysical studies of the octapodal compound in solution and the solid thin film reveal the formation of J&#8208;type aggregates, in which the interaction between donors (porphyrin) and acceptors (fullerene) dominates leading to absorption bands in the NIR region of the spectra. The mixture of both compounds results in a self&#8208;assembly which is called the Click procedure. Fullerenes of the octopus nanosegregate in the pockets of the star mesogens generating hexagonal columnar structures with a regular stacking along the columnar axis. Thus providing free space is a tool to control the competition between supramolecular interactions and nanosegregation. Such liquid&#8208;crystalline donor&#8208;acceptor structures may play a role in future LC photovoltaic applications.

         <title>A Phosphorus&#8208;Centred, Zirconocene&#8208;Bridged Tetraradical: Synthesis, Structure and Application as Molecular Double Switch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthesis of a phosphorus&#8208;centred tetraradical linked to a zirconocene fragment is presented, which can act as a molecular switch both in solution and in the solid state. This new hybrid switch was used to switch H2 addition on and off, which can be controlled photochemically.







Abstract
Biradicals are important intermediates in the formation and breaking of a chemical bond. Their use as molecular switches is of particular interest. Much less is known about tetraradicals, which can, for example, consist of two biradical(oid) units. Here we report the synthesis of the first persistent phosphorus&#8208;centred tetraradical bound to a transition metal fragment. Starting from a zirconocene complex, rac&#8208;(ebthi)ZrCl2 (rac&#8208;(ebthi)=1,2&#8208;ethylene&#8208;1,10&#8208;bis(&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydroindenyl), two cyclo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diphospha&#8208;pentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyls were successfully introduced, which finally led to the isolation of a deep green zirconcene&#8208;bridged bis(biradicaloid) complex (5) that can act as a double molecular switch. Under the influence of light (570&#8197;nm), this tetraradical forms a transannular bond in each of the two five&#8208;membered biradical units, leading to the formation of housane 5&#8201;h. Upon irradiation at 415&#8197;nm, the reverse reaction is observed, fully recovering tetraradical 5. Through single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation, both stable species of the molecular switch could be structurally characterised using SCXRD. The switching under the influence of light and the activation of molecular hydrogen were analysed in solution using NMR and UV spectroscopy. It was found that the addition of one or two equivalents of molecular hydrogen can be switched on and off by light.

This new hybrid switch was used to switch H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; addition on and off, which can be controlled photochemically&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biradicals are important intermediates in the formation and breaking of a chemical bond. Their use as molecular switches is of particular interest. Much less is known about tetraradicals, which can, for example, consist of two biradical(oid) units. Here we report the synthesis of the first persistent phosphorus-centred tetraradical bound to a transition metal fragment. Starting from a zirconocene complex, &lt;i&gt;rac&lt;/i&gt;-(ebthi)ZrCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;rac&lt;/i&gt;-(ebthi)=1,2-ethylene-1,10-bis(&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-tetrahydroindenyl), two cyclo-1,3-diphospha-pentane-1,3-diyls were successfully introduced, which finally led to the isolation of a deep green zirconcene-bridged bis(biradicaloid) complex (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;) that can act as a double molecular switch. Under the influence of light (570&#8197;nm), this tetraradical forms a transannular bond in each of the two five-membered biradical units, leading to the formation of housane &lt;b&gt;5&#8201;h&lt;/b&gt;. Upon irradiation at 415&#8197;nm, the reverse reaction is observed, fully recovering tetraradical &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;. Through single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation, both stable species of the molecular switch could be structurally characterised using SCXRD. The switching under the influence of light and the activation of molecular hydrogen were analysed in solution using NMR and UV spectroscopy. It was found that the addition of one or two equivalents of molecular hydrogen can be switched on and off by light.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Phase Behavior of Surface&#8208;Active Fluorinated Ionic Liquid Epoxidation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the synthesis of amphiphobic fluorinated surface&#8208;active ionic liquid (FSAIL) epoxidation catalysts, which show reversible temperature&#8208;controlled solubility in water. The solubility of FSAILs containing the catalytically active perrhenate&#8208; and tungstate anions was studied in both the aqueous and the substrate phase, showing a significant solubility decrease in both media compared to their non&#8208;fluorinated congeners. It was shown that both the epoxide product and the catalyst additive phenylphosphonic acid (PPA) are efficient in transferring the FSAIL catalyst into the organic phase, rendering the reaction homogeneous. The FSAILs were used as catalysts for the epoxidation of olefins using aqueous H2O2 as oxidant, showing an exceptionally high catalytic activity at mild conditions. Catalyst recycling was demonstrated over ten consecutive runs by phase separation and subsequent product distillation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Strongly Ambiphilic Ferrocene&#8208;Based Cyclic (Alkyl)(amino)carbene &#8211; Specific Decomposition to an Enamine by a 1,2&#8208;Phenyl Shift</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recently described crystalline cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene with a 1,1&#8217;&#8208;ferrocenylene (fc) backbone fc(CPh2&#8211;C&#8211;NMes) (A, Mes = mesityl) is highly reactive due to its particularly pronounced ambiphilicity and is thermally not stable in solution due to an intramolecular insertion of the divalent carbon atom into a methyl C&#8211;H bond of the Mes substituent. The closely related congener fc(CPh2&#8211;C&#8211;N&#8208;p&#8208;C6H4&#8208;tBu) (1) cannot undergo such an insertion reaction. Nevertheless, 1 is too short&#8208;lived for isolation due to a rapid 1,2&#8208;shift of a phenyl group, furnishing the isomeric cyclic enamine fc[C(Ph)=C(Ph)&#8211;N&#8208;p&#8208;C6H4&#8208;tBu] (1&#8217;) in a specific decomposition process unprecedented for CAACs. Trapping of 1 was possible with carbon monoxide, elemental selenium and with [CuBr(SMe2)], respectively affording the aminoketene 1=C=O, the selenoamide 1=Se and the homoleptic CuI complex [Cu(1)2][CuBr2]. 1 is an even stronger ambiphile than A according to NMR spectroscopic data. Similar to A, 1 does not react with H2, because the experimentally observed intramolecular process is kinetically more favourable according to DFT results.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulating the Substituent Sphere of a Bicyclic Silicon(I) Ring Compound Results in Anionic Cubane&#8208;Type Clusters and a Tetrahedral Silanide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of the bicyclic silicon(I) ring compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4 1 with strong zwitterionic character and moderate sterical demand of the amido substituents with two equivalents of KC8 was investigated. This resulted in the unexpected abstraction of two amido substituents from 1 and additionally in dimerization to a dianionic Si8 cluster compound 2 with four unsubstituted silicon atoms and two [K([18]crown&#8208;6)]+ counter cations. Performing this reaction in the absence of [18]crown&#8208;6 results in release of only one amido substituent from 1 and dimerization to a dianionic Si8 cluster compound 3 with only two unsubstituted silicon atoms. This reaction with KC8 was repeated and trapping agents such as SiMe3Cl and tBuCl were added in&#8208;situ whereupon the second isolated homocyclic silylene 4 and a monoanionic hydride and tBu substituted Si8 cluster 5 with one unsubstituted silicon atom were isolated. Furthermore, 1 was reacted with KOtBu which resulted in the selective abstraction of one SiMe3 group and formation of the tetrahedral silanide 6 with one imido substituent bridging an edge of the tetrahedron.</dc:description>

         <title>Secondary Sphere Lewis Acid Activated Heme Superoxo Adducts Mimic Crucial Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in IDO/TDO Heme Dioxygenases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heme enzymes play a central role in a medley of reactivities within a wide variety of crucial biological systems. Their active sites are highly decorated with pivotal evolutionarily optimized non&#8208;covalent interactions that precisely choreograph their biological functionalities with specific regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and chemo&#8208;selectivities. Gaining a clear comprehension of how such weak interactions within the active sites control reactivity offers powerful information to be implemented into the design of future therapeutic agents that target these heme enzymes. To shed light on such critical details pertaining to tryptophan dioxygenating heme enzymes, this study investigates the indole dioxygenation reactivities of Lewis acid&#8208;activated heme superoxo model systems, wherein an unprecedented kinetic behavior is revealed. In that, the activated heme superoxo adduct is observed to undergo indole dioxygenation with the intermediacy of a non&#8208;covalently organized precursor complex, which forms prior to the rate&#8208;limiting step of the overall reaction landscape. Spectroscopic and theoretical characterization of this precursor complex draws close parallels to the ternary complex of heme dioxygenases, which has been postulated to be of crucial importance for successful 2,3&#8208;dioxygenative cleavage of indole moieties.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>6,13&#8208;Diethynylpentacene derivatives with sterically bulky substituents (Tr*, tris(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl)methyl groups) appended to the ethynyl moieties at the 6&#8208; and 13&#8208;positions have been synthesized, as well as derivatives with electron withdrawing fluorine groups on the eight pro&#8208;cata positions. These molecules are designed to investigate relationships between steric and electronic effects on the stability of pentacene toward endoperoxide formation via reaction with photosensitized oxygen in solution under conditions of ambient light (i.e., &#8216;laboratory&#8217; conditions). It is evident from the study that stabilization through changes to the electronic characteristics of pentacene are more effective than the incorporation of sterically bulky groups at the acetylenic termini. Selected pentacene derivatives have been made into binary, amorphous films with the fullerene derivative PCBM to investigate the stability imparted by substituents against cycloaddition reactions. Overall, the introduction of steric protection through incorporation of Tr* groups is not an efficient strategy for enhancing persistence of pentacenes. Stabilization through fluorination proves successful for extending the lifetime of the pentacene derivatives by an order of magnitude in solution. Notably, the persistence of pentacene derivatives in solution can also be enhanced through the use ethereal solvents stabilized with butylated hydroxy toluene (BHT) and/or an increased number of trialkylsilyl groups as substituents.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of an Electrochemical Cell for Continuous Wave EPR Measurements of Radical Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (cw&#8208;EPR) with electrochemistry is highly attractive as it allows a clean in&#8208;situ generation and the subsequent spectroscopic characterisation of radical ions, which are important intermediates in many photocatalytic cycles as well as light&#8208;induced processes occurring in biological systems or optoelectronic devices. Although commercial setups for spectroelectrochemical EPR are available, they are often expensive and tailored to a particular spectroscopic setup.&#160;
Here we present a design for a low&#8208;cost electrochemical EPR cell that can be used in combination with any commercial cw&#8208;EPR instrumentation. The cell design is compared to existing setups and the performance of the cell is evaluated by comparison of EPR spectra obtained by chemical and electrochemical oxidation of a graphene fragment.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The combination of continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (cw-EPR) with electrochemistry is highly attractive as it allows a clean in-situ generation and the subsequent spectroscopic characterisation of radical ions, which are important intermediates in many photocatalytic cycles as well as light-induced processes occurring in biological systems or optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Investigation of Neighboring Group Participation in 3,4&#8208;Diacetylated Glycosyl Donors in the Gas Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A key challenge in oligosaccharide synthesis is the stereoselective installation of glycosidic bonds. Each glycosidic linkage has one of two possible stereo&#8208;chemical geometries, &#945;/&#946; or 1,2&#8208;cis/trans. An established approach to install 1,2&#8208;trans glycosidic bonds is neighboring group participation (NGP), mediated by a 2&#8208;O&#8208;acyl group. Extension of this intramolecular stabilization to nucleophilic groups located at more remote positions has also been suggested, but remains poorly understood. Previously, we employed infrared ion spectroscopy to characterize the molecular ions of monoacetylated sugar donors and showed how the strength of the stabilizing effect depends on the position of the participating ester group on the glycosyl donor ring as well as on its relative stereochemistry. In this work, we investigated glycosyl donors carrying two acyl groups. Using isotope labelling and isomer population analysis we were able to resolving spectra of isomeric mixtures and establish the relative contribution of individual species. We conclude that 3,4&#8208;diacetyl mannosyl donors exclusively form a dioxanium ion as a result of C&#8208;3 acyl stabilization. In contrast, the glucosyl and galactosyl cations form mixtures of C&#8208;3 and C&#8208;4 acyl participation products. Hence, the combination of isotope labeling and population analysis allows for the study of increasingly complex glycosyl cations.</dc:description>

         <title>Adjusting the Number of Functional Groups in Vicinal Bis(trichlorosilylated) Benzenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organo(chloro)silanes are essential chemicals, but the synthesis of compounds of the formula RnSiCl4&#8210;n with defined values of n is usually laborious. Herein, we first disclose that a [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition between readily available Cl3SiC&#8801;CSiCl3 and selected dienes provides facile access to vicinal bis(trichlorosilylated) benzenes and bicyclo[2.2.2]octa&#8208;2,5&#8208;dienes. Second, we show how the number of six Si&#8210;Cl bonds in 1,2&#8208;(Cl3Si)2C6H2Me2 (1) can be selectively reduced to four or two by reaction with pinacol (H2pin) or catechol (H2cat), which act as Si&#183;&#183;&#183;Si&#8217;&#8208;bridging and/or Si&#8208;chelating ligands. Third, we demonstrate that the thermolysis of compound 6, which contains a benzannulated eight&#8208;membered C2(SiCl2)2(&#956;&#8208;pin) ring with Si&#183;&#183;&#183;Si&#8217;&#8208;bridging pin moiety, furnishes 13 with a benzannulated five&#8208;membered C2(SiCl2)2O ring via the release of pinacolone. Such cyclic disiloxanes are valuable building blocks for specialty silicones; an alternative assembly of the Si&#8210;O&#8210;Si unit by controlled hydrolysis of 1 is not feasible if the four valuable Si&#8210;Cl functionalities are to be retained for further derivatization. Substitution of one Cl atom per Si site of 13 gives the rac&#8208;1,3&#8208;disila&#8208;2&#8208;oxaindane rac&#8208;15 with high selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Differential Sensing Approach as a Pattern&#8208;based Discrimination for Biological Samples</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The differential sensing approach uses fingerprint patterning to distinguish uncharacterized biological samples. Inspired by natural sensory systems, an array of cross&#8208;reactive sensors generates unique response fingerprint depending on the samples. Until today, this array system has been developed using various materials, including the library of surface&#8208;charged nanoparticles and chemosensors. Many differential array systems have demonstrated accurate identification of bacterial species, viral subtypes, and cancer cells, as well as distinguishing disease states in blood or urine. This capability is particularly important for distinguishing between normal and abnormal states when specific marker molecules have not yet been identified, providing a powerful diagnostic tool. In this concept, we summarized representative outcomes of differential sensing applications for biological sample discrimination.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering the cell surface sugar&#8208;coating via Biochemical Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cell surface components, specifically glycans, play a significant role in several biological functions like cell structure, crosstalk between cells, and eventual target recognition of the cells for therapeutics. The dense layer of glycans, i.e., glycocalyx, could differ in taxon, species, and cell type. Glycans are coupled with lipids and proteins to form glycolipids, glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol&#8208;anchored proteins, making their study challenging. However, understanding glycosylation at the cellular level is vital for fundamental research and the advancement of glycan&#8208;targeted therapy. Among different pathways, metabolic glycan labelling uses the natural metabolic processes of the cell to introduce abiotic functionality into glycan residues. The Bertozzi group pioneered metabolic oligosaccharide engineering using glycan salvage pathways to convert monosaccharides with unnatural modifications. This eventually results in the probe becoming part of the complex cellular glycan structures via click chemistry using copper. On the other hand, the boronic acid&#8208;based probe can recognise carbohydrates in a single step without any chemical modification of the surface. This review discusses the significance of glycans as biomarkers for different diseases and the necessity to evaluate them in situ within the physiological environment. The review also discusses the prospect of this field and its potential applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we disclose for the first time that formate salt can be used as a bifunctional reagent for the synthesis of phenol derivatives and as a CO source for carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling processes using the COware gas reactor under activation free conditions. Key to this success is the in&#8208;situ synthesis of aryl formate via an unprecedented nickel/organophotocatalyst system under blue LED irradiation. This developed system demonstrated high applicability to various aryl iodide substrates for synthesizing phenol derivatives. Moreover, the generated CO could be utilized in a range of carbonylative C&#8208;heteroatom and C&#8208;C processes. Notably, commercially available H13COONa salt can serve as a bifunctional reagent for both synthesizing phenols and generating 13CO.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformation Regulation of Trisresorcinarene Directed by Cavity Solvation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This compound is a synthetic macrocycle comprising three pivaloyl&#8208;protected resorcinarene units connected by six pentylene chains. We conducted a conformational study using 1H&#8208;NMR, X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and computational analyses. The macrocycle adopts two conformers, one open, the other closed. The ratio of the open to closed forms depended on the solvent used. Only the open form existed in [D8]toluene, both forms coexisted in [D6]benzene, and the closed form was the major conformer in [D1]chloroform. The benzene&#8208;solvated open form observed in the solid state suggests that cavity solvation by solvent molecules directs the open form. The open form was the major or only conformer in [D10]o&#8208; and [D10]m&#8208;xylene and [D12]mesitylene, whereas the closed form was the major conformer in [D6]acetone. The open and closed forms were equally populated in [D10]p&#8208;xylene, suggesting that the size, shape, and dimensions of the solvent molecules most likely influenced the conformation of the protected trisresocinarene.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Generation of Benzyl Anions from Aryl Ketones Utilizing [1,2]&#8208;Phospha&#8208;Brook Rearrangement and Their Application to Synthesis of Tertiary Benzylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A synthetic method of tertiary alcohols was developed based on the formal umpolung addition of aryl ketones with electrophiles utilizing the [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement under Br&#248;nsted base catalysis. The addition reaction of &#945;&#8208;hydroxyphosphonates, derived from alkyl aryl&#8208; and diaryl ketones, with electrophiles such as phenyl vinyl sulfone, afforded phosphates having a tertiary alkyl group, which were readily convertible to the corresponding tertiary benzylic alcohols. This operationally simple protocol provides efficient complementary access to tertiary alcohols that are difficult to synthesize by conventional methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to diverse carbonyl compounds by catalyst&#8208;free and photoinduced aerobic cleavage of C=N bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functional group interconversion is of great significance in organic synthesis. However, aerobic cleavage of C=N bonds to access carbonyl compounds still suffered from some limitations such as harsh reaction conditions, stoichiometric oxidants, poor substrate scope and use of toxic reagents. Herein, we report a catalyst&#8208;free and photo&#8208;induced aerobic cleavage of C=N bonds to afford diverse carbonyl compounds using oxygen from air as green oxidant. This mild methodology permits N&#8208;tosylhydrazones converted into the corresponding carbonyl compounds including ketones, amides, aldehydes and carboxylic acids, showing broad functional group tolerance and compatibility. Moreover, the gram&#8208;scale reaction and post&#8208;modification of complicated molecules proved the applicability and efficiency of this strategy. Finally, a plausible mechanism was proposed based on spectroscopic investigations and detailed mechanistic studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferrocenyl Dithiophosphonate Ag(I) Complexes: Synthesis, Structures, Luminescence, and Electrocatalytic Water Splitting Tuned by Nuclearity and Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The heterometallic [Ag(I)/Fe(II)] molecular electrocatalysts for hydrogen production were introduced here to recognize the mutual role of metallic nuclearity and ligand engineering. A series of ferrocenyl dithiophosphonate stabilized mononuclear [Ag(PPh3)2{S2PFc(OR)}] {where R = Me (1), Et (2), nPr (3), iPr (4), iAmyl (5); Fc = Fe (&#627;5&#8208;C5H4)(&#627;5&#8208;C5H5) } and dinuclear [Ag(PPh3){S2PFc(OR}]2 {where R = Et (2a), and nPr (3a)} complexes were synthesized and characterized by SCXRD, NMR (31P and 1H), ESI&#8208;MS, UV&#8208;Vis, and FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy. The comparative electrocatalytic HER behavior of 1&#8722;5 and 2a&#8722;3a showed effective current density of 1 mA/cm2 with overpotentials ranging from 772 to 991 mV, demonstrating the influence of extended and branched carbon chains in dithiophosphonates and metallic (mono&#8208;/di&#8208;) nuclearity, which correlates with documented tetra&#8208;nuclear [Ag4(S2PFc(OnPr)4], 6. DFT study suggests the coordinated (&#956;1&#8208;S) site of ligands is the reactivity center and the adsorption energy of intermediate [H*&#8208;SM] varies with the engineering of ligand and nuclearity. A catalytic mechanism using mononuclear (1) and di&#8208;nuclear (2a) was proposed with the assistance of DFT. Each complex, being the first example of Ag(I) dithiophosphonates, exhibits intense photoluminescence with high quantum yields ranging from 33% to 67%. These results link the lower nuclearity structures to their physical and catalytic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Peripheral Fusion of Carbon&#8208;based Aromatic Rings to B4N4&#8208;Heteropentalene Leading to Close &#960;&#8208;Stacking in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#960;&#8208;Electronic molecules with a BN&#8208;heterocyclic and carbon&#8208;based aromatic hybrid ring system (h&#8208;CBN) are interesting in that they potentially exhibit synergistic properties arising from the two different &#960;&#8208;systems. Here we report the synthesis and properties of a h&#8208;CBN&#8208;type molecule (1) having a bicyclic B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene core fused with extended aromatic rings. This molecule exhibits excellent chemical stability despite the absence of bulky substituents for kinetic protection, which in turn provides effective stacking of the &#960;&#8208;system upon crystallization. Depending on the crystallization solvent, 1 forms two polymorphs, i.e., the &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;phases. While both phases have one&#8208;dimensional columnar structures, the &#960;&#8208;stacking geometries associated with the transfer integrals of the frontier orbitals are different, resulting in a twofold difference in the electrical conducting properties. We also found that upon thermal vacuum deposition, 1 gives an amorphous film, which serves as a host material for a red phosphorescent OLED device (maximum external quantum efficiency: 15.5 and 13.3% at 0.1 and 2.5 mA, respectively).</dc:description>

         <title>Complexes of a Frustrated Lewis Pair&#8208;Supported P(&#8211;1) Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several complexes of the intramolecular frustrated Lewis pair (FLP)&#8208;supported P(&#8211;1) ligand [iPr2P(C6H4)BCy2{P}]&#8211; are presented (Cy = cyclohexyl). Chief among these is the first example of a monomeric zinc bis(phosphido) complex, which was synthesized as a potential precursor for the solution&#8208;phase deposition of Zn3P2. While this goal was ultimately unsuccessful, the Zn(II) complex acts as a convenient springboard to other metal phosphide species via transmetallation: namely, a tellurium bis(phosphido) and a formal adduct of the phosphorus subhalide PPCl2. Trapping experiments show that the PPCl2 adduct can also be prepared directly through the in situ reduction of PCl3 in the presence of an intramolecular FLP ligand. Lastly, we report a formal &#951;2&#8208;phosphaborene complex of cobalt(&#8208;1) which is isoelectronic to olefin complexes, and explore its bonding via density functional theory (DFT) computations.</dc:description>

         <title>Research Progress on Ni&#8208;based Electrocatalysts for Electrochemical Reduction of Nitrogen to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical NRR&#160;to synthesize ammonia&#160;is considered as a promising method due to its approvable advantages of zero&#8208;pollution emission, feasible reaction proceedings, good safety and easy management. The multiple efforts have been devoted to the exploration of earth&#8208;abundant&#8208;element&#8208;based nanomaterials as high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for realizing their industrial applications. Among these, the Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials is prioritized as an attractive non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal electrocatalysts for catalyzing NRR because they are earth&#8208;abundance and exceedingly easy to synthesize as well as also delivers the potential of high electrocatalytic activity and durability. In this review, after briefly elucidating the underlying mechanisms of NRR during the electrochemical process, we systematically sum up the recent research progress in representative Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts, including monometallic Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials, bimetallic Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials, polymetallic Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials, etc. In particular, we discuss the effects of physicochemical properties, such as phases, crystallinity, morphology, composition, defects, heteroatom doping, and strain engineering, on the comprehensive performance of the abovementioned electrocatalysts, with the aim of establishing the nanostructure&#8208;function relationships of the electrocatalysts. In addition, the promising directions of Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts for NRR are also pointed out and highlighted. The generic approach in this review may expand the frontiers of NRR and provides the inspiration for developing high&#8208;efficiently Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Bi2Mo3O12: A Dual&#8208;Functional material for electrocatalytic water splitting and supercapacitor applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study explores the functionality of &#945;&#8208;Bi2Mo3O12 (BMO) as an electrocatalyst for water splitting and its suitability for supercapacitor applications. BMO was synthesized by the solvothermal method and characterized in pre&#8208;calcination [BMO (BC)], post&#8208;calcination [BMO (AC)], and base&#8208;etched forms [BMO (BE)]. Structural analysis confirmed the formation of &#945;&#8208;Bi2Mo3O12 with well&#8208;defined crystallographic planes. Electrochemical analysis revealed that BMO (AC) exhibited the lowest overpotential for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and BMO (BC) exhibited the lowest overpotential for oxygen evolution reactions (OER), indicating its superior electrocatalytic activity. The Tafel slope and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results confirmed the superior kinetics and charge transfer properties of BMO material. Furthermore, BMO samples demonstrated excellent stability during prolonged chronoamperometry (CA) testing for 12 h. For supercapacitor performances, the BMO (BE) exhibits a superior specific capacitance value of 398 F/g at 2.0 A/g. Thus, the BMO material delivers prominent electrocatalytic activity as well as supercapacitor performance. Overall, this study demonstrates the potentiality of &#945;&#8208;Bi2Mo3O12 in different forms as a dual&#8208;functional material for efficient energy storage and conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Quantum Coherence of Reversible Photo&#8208;generated Radical and Its Film</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron spin qubits are becoming an important research direction in the field of quantum computing and information storage. However, the quantum decoherence has seriously hindered the development of this field. So far, few qubits exhibit long phase memory time (Tm), and even fewer qubits that can reach room temperature. Some reports show that the coherence times of radicals are generally long, so radicals may be the preferred spin carriers for qubits. Here, we demonstrate the qubit properties of a photogenerated radical (1a) based on 2,4,6&#8208;Tri(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (tpt, 1). More importantly, the photogenerated radical is a spin self&#8208;diluting complex, which the dilution is generally used in the investigation of qubits to reduce the interference of environment on qubits in order to overcome the decoherence of qubits. It is surprised that radical tpt has a stable Tm = 1.1 &#956;s above 20 K, even keep it to room temperature. In addition, the tpt&#8208;film prepared by the vacuum evaporation is significantly increase the T1 and Tm at low temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Discrete Macrocyclic Polymers Hosts Induced Cascade Luminescence Enhancement and Application in Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integration of polymers, supramolecular macrocycles and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) molecules provides numerous possibilities for constructing various functional supramolecular systems. Herein, we constructed supramolecular assembled systems based on discrete macrocyclic polymer hosts via the cooperation of hydra&#8208;headed macrocycles containing two or three pillar[5]arene units (defined as P2, P3), the block polymer F127 and AIE molecules (alkyl&#8208;cyano modified tetraphenylethene, alkyl&#8208;triazole&#8208;cyano modified 9,10&#8208;distyrylanthracene, defined as TPE&#8208;(CN)4 and DSA&#8208;(TACN)2). Compared with the binary assembly between hydra&#8208;headed hosts or F127 and AIE molecules, cascaded supramolecular assembly&#8208;induced emission enhancement (SAIEE) in aqueous solution was achieved in discrete macrocyclic polymer&#8208;based supramolecular assembled systems. Considering the cascaded SAIEE performance, we have successfully applied discrete macrocyclic polymer&#8208;based supramolecular assembled systems to bioimaging and constructed an artificial light&#8208;harvesting system (LHs) to explore more potential applications. The supramolecular assembly form of discrete macrocyclic polymers hosts and AIE molecules proposed in this work provides new inspiration for the construction and application of high&#8208;performance supramolecular luminescent systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Reduced Surface Area for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Porous Electrode via Electrical Conductivity Relaxation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance of porous electrode is critical for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). However, the effects of gas diffusion on the ORR in porous media need further investigation, although some issues, such as nonthermal surface oxygen exchange, have been attributed to gas diffusion. Herein, La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3&#8208;&#948; (LSCF) with various porosity, pore radii and gas permeability were investigated via the electrical conductivity relaxation method and analysed using the distributed of characteristic time (DCT) model. The ORR is revealed with three characteristic times, which are gas diffusion, oxygen exchange via the surface corresponding to small pores, and oxygen exchange to large pores. Gas diffusion delays the oxygen surface exchange reaction, resulting in very low chemical oxygen surface exchange coefficient compared with that obtained with dense sample under the assumption that all the surfaces are active for the ORR. Reduced surface area is thus defined to quantitatively represent the gas diffusion effects. The reduced surface area increases with increasing gas permeability, demonstrating the importance of electrode engineering for fast gas transport. Moreover, reduced surface area is suggested for replacing the specific surface area to calculate the electrode polarization resistance using the ALS model.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthetic methodology for the preparation of photoresponsive dioxazaborocanes&#8208;containing oligomers is developed. It relies on the transformation of the (diisopropylamino)boryl group (&#8208;BH(NiPr2)) into a dioxazaborocane unit in the presence &#946;&#8208;aminodiols and involves a bis&#8208;borylated dithienylethene photochromic unit. The photophysical properties of the obtained oligomers are evaluated as well as their processability for the preparation of spin&#8208;coated films. The photomechanical behavior of the resulting films is assessed via displacement tracking profile.</dc:description>

         <title>Amplifying reactivity of bio&#8208;inspired [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase mimics by organic nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A bio&#8208;inspired FeFe hydrogenase model which catalyses hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic solutions is immobilized in polyaniline (PANI)&#8208;based nanotubes. A combination of analytical techniques reveals that this construct maintains both the molecular signatures of the bio&#8208;inspired complex and the material properties of PANI. The amine and imine&#8208;rich environment of the PANI chain amplifies the inherent HER activity of the bio&#8208;inspired complex, allowing electrocatalytic HER at neutral pH, with lower overpotentials and higher current densities compared to the bio&#8208;inspired complex alone. This construct retains the oxygen stability of the bio&#8208;inspired complex and remains stable through several hours of aerobic electrolysis, producing only 6.5% H2O2 from the competing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).</dc:description>

         <title>Pd/C Catalyzed Selective N&#8208;monomethylation by Transfer Hydrogenation of Urea derivatives using Methanol as H2 and C1 Sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;monomethyl amines are useful intermediates in drugs, natural products, paints. Yet their synthesis is a tremendous challenge due to their high reactivity, typically leading to overmethylation. In this contribution, a highly selective catalytic N&#8208;methylation methodology is reported, converting urea derivatives to monomethylated amines, using a commercially available heterogeneous Pd/C catalyst and methanol as unique reagent. Methanol provides a sustainable alternative protocol for the selective preparation of mono&#8208;methylated derivatives as it acts as both H2 and C1 sources. In addition, several control experiments were performed to provide a proposal for the mechanism, namely dehydrogenation of methanol and subsequent hydrogenation of urea derivatives, followed by reduction of the in situ formed methyl imine. Importantly, the approach is simple, highly productive and enables novel synthetic procedures for the preparation of monomethylamines from urea derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Reactivity, and Bonding Analysis of a Tetracoordinated Nickel Carbene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nickel carbenes are key reactive intermediates in the catalytic cyclopropanation of olefins and other reactions, but isolated examples are scarce and generally rely on low coordination numbers (&#8804; 3) to stabilize the metal&#8211;ligand multiple bond. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a stable tetracoordinated nickel carbene bearing a triphosphine pincer ligand. Its nucleophilic character is evidenced by reaction with acids, and it can transfer the carbene fragment to CO to form a ketene. A computational study of the Ni=C chemical bond sheds light on the role of the third phosphine in the pincer framework to the stabilization of the nickel carbene fragment.</dc:description>

         <title>The possible aromatic conjugation via the different edges of (car)borane clusters &#8722; Can the relationship between 3D and 2D aromatic systems be reconciled?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The possible aromatic conjugation between 3D and 2D aromatic units is in the focus since the synthesis of benzocarborane. It has been showed that in the 3D aromatic icosahedral 1,2&#8208;dicarba&#8208;closo&#8208;dodecaborane systems fused with 2D aromatic rings a global 3D/2D aromaticity does not exist. Despite this fact during the last years several studies propose interactions between 2D and 3D moieties. Herein, while tuning the size and the effective charge of the (car)borane systems, we demonstrate that global aromatic character can be excluded in any investigated cases, and the detectable conjugative properties can be explained the effect of the well&#8208;known negative hyperconjugation.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrasonication&#8208;Boosted Resorcinol&#8208;Formaldehyde Resin Nanoparticle Bromine Fixation and Corresponding Upgraded Aquatic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bromine (Br2) and related species removal from water systems are rather complicated due to the complicated chemistry instability, and materials with high Br2 removal rate and efficiency, along with stimuli/apparatus suitable for highly corrosive environments, are necessary. Ultrasonication as a non&#8208;destructive process is especially suitable in scenarios where conventional stir apparatus is not applicable, such as highly corrosive environments. Considering the validity nature of Br2 and combining the advantages of ultrasonic with a highly stable Br2 fixation method through aromatic polymer nanoparticles, we demonstrate highly efficient acoustic&#8208;aided Br2 removal in aqueous solutions with two times capacity compared to the non&#8208;treated sample. Related aquatic applications are also proposed for the materials to be cost&#8208;effective, including silver (Ag) recovery, recyclable MnO2&#8208;mediated Br2 deep removal, and aqueous zinc anode modification. The coupled novel&#8208;material&#8208;based processes motivate the strategic design of water purification with high&#8208;safety and sustainable industrial procedures and post&#8208;value&#8208;added utilizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Coordinate Dinuclear Donor&#8208;Gold(I)&#8208;Acceptor Complexes Exhibiting Multiple Excitation Wavelength Dependent Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;coordinate Au(I) complexes with a donor&#8208;metal&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;M&#8208;A) structure have shown rich luminescent properties. However, charge&#8208;neutral dinuclear donor&#8208;metal&#8208;acceptor type Au(I) complexes featuring aurophilic interactions have been seldom explored. Herein, we describe the structures and photoluminescence properties of two dinuclear Au(I) complexes, namely DiAu&#8208;Ph and DiAu&#8208;Me. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis of DiAu&#8208;Ph reveals a short intramolecular Au&#8208;Au distance of 3.224 &#197;. In dilute solution and doped films, excitation wavelength dependent multiple phosphorescence phenomena were observed for these dinuclear complexes. Theoretical calculations reveal that the aurophilic interaction causes increased contribution of the Au d orbital to the highest occupied molecular orbitals. Thus, the gap between singlet and triplet excited states (&#916;EST) is enlarged, which disables the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Moreover, the large energy separation (0.45&#8208;0.52 eV) and the different orbital configurations between the various excited states result in an inefficient internal conversion, accounting for their multiple phosphorescence properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Janus Reactivity of Crownphyrinoids: Alkali&#8208; vs. Transition Metal&#8208;Mediated Transformations of Crown Ether&#8208;Porphyrin Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crownphyrinogens and crownphyrins constitute a group of macrocycles that combine the structural facets of porphyrinoids and crown ethers. The dual&#8208;nature cavity embedded in their molecules enables reactivity involving two structurally distinct parts of the macrocyclic ligand. Upon Ni(II) and Pd(II) insertion, coordination compounds are produced wherein the metal is incorporated into the porphyrinoid&#8208;like pocket, resulting in monomeric or accordion&#8208;like dimeric products, depending on the oxidation level of the macrocycle and metal cation. The reactions with Na(I) and K(I) resulted in the formation of complexes where only the crown ether segment of the molecule is involved in metal binding, yielding remarkable dimeric species. The exploitation of a crownphyrin large enough to accommodate two metal cations allowed the synthesis of an alkali/transition metal binuclear complexes wherein the macrocycle demonstrated the Janus reactivity with one cavity acting as a porphyrinoid, and the other mimicking the crown ether.</dc:description>
